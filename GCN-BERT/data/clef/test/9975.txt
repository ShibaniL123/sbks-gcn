BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to awning devices, and more particularly to portable awning devices. Even more particularly, this invention relates to portable awning devices configured for attachment to seating. 2. Description of the Background Art Bleachers and benches are among the most common forms of seating in many outdoor event venues. In general, bleachers and benches are intended to provide the most cost effective solution to seating as many spectators as possible. In achieving this goal, personal comfort and protection from the elements (i.e., rain, sun, wind, etc.) is often sacrificed. In effort to increase personal comfort and protection from the elements while attending outdoor events, many types of canopy devices have been developed. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,086,931 (Hall) teaches an umbrella shelter that is adapted to detachably mount to a stadium bench. The umbrella includes a base that hooks around a bench and includes a vertical pole socket. The pole socket supports an umbrella pole that further supports an umbrella frame. The umbrella frame includes a number of structures (e.g., ribs, struts, spring elements, etc.) that support a piece of fabric. Although the umbrella shelter of Hall provides some protection from the elements, there are several disadvantages inherent to the design. For example, umbrellas are structurally unstable in high winds. As another example, the umbrella shelter design of Hall is relatively complicated in that it includes a high number of moving parts. Consequently, the umbrella shelter of Hall is difficult to use and transport. What is needed, therefore, is a portable canopy device that is capable of withstanding extreme conditions. What is also needed is a portable canopy device having a less complicated design that is easier to operate and more convenient to transport.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention overcomes the problems associated with the prior art, by providing a simplified portable awning that is adapted to mount on a bleacher/bench type seat or the back of a lawn chair. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth (e.g., fabric types, frame elements, etc.) in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. Those skilled in the art will recognize, however, that the invention may be practiced apart from these specific details. In other instances, details of well-known tube manufacturing practices (e.g., tube bending, welding, etc.) and components have been omitted, so as not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention. FIG. 1 shows a perspective view of a portable seat awning 100 mounted on a seat 102 which, in this example, is a bleacher/bench type seat. Awning 100 can be universally attached to, and detached from, any suitable bleacher/bench type seat (e.g., stadium seating, picnic tables, etc.). Awning 100 includes a flexible fabric 104 coupled to a frame 106 via a plurality of fasteners 108. Fabric 104 is, for example, an opaque material that is wind and water proof. Accordingly, fabric 104 protects a user from sunlight, wind, and rain. In this particular embodiment, fasteners 108 are hook-and-loop fasteners attached to the peripheral edge of fabric 104 and wrapped around frame 106. As shown, an elastic cord (e.g., a bungee cord) 110 is used to secure frame 106 onto seat 102. FIG. 2 shows a perspective view of frame 106 in an open/erected condition. Frame 106 includes a set of frame side structures 200, a first horizontal section 202, a second horizontal section 204, and two seat engaging structures 206. Each of frame side structures 200 includes a vertical section 208 and a horizontal section 210. Each of vertical sections 208 is coupled to a respective one of horizontal sections 210 via a respective locking feature 212. Each of locking features 212 includes a U-shaped element 214, a hinge pin 216, and a push tab 218. U-shaped element 214 is, for example, a short section of channel stock. Hinge pins 216 facilitate the pivoting of horizontal sections 210 with respect to vert cal sections 208. Push tabs 218 extend from horizontal sections 210 and are shown disposed in holes formed in the sides of u-shaped elements 214. Each vertical section 208 includes an upper portion 220 and a tower portion 222. As shown, the diameter of lower portion 222 is slightly larger than that of upper portion 220 such that upper portion 220 and tower portion 222 are coupled in a telescoping relationship. Lower portion 222 also includes a plurality of holes 224 that receive push tabs 226 of upper portion 220. Holes 224 and push tabs 226 enable the height of frame structures 200 to be adjusted according to user preference. Each of tower portions 222 further includes a plate 228 rigidly attached thereto by some suitable means such as, for example, welding. Plate 228 is adapted to engage the top surface of seat 102 while also limiting the distance at which seat engaging structures 206 can be rotated. Each of lower portions 222 are pivotally coupled to a respective one of seat engaging structures 206 via a hinge pin 230. First horizontal section 202 includes two straight tubes 232 and a locking feature 234. Each straight tube 232 is pivotally coupled to a respective one of horizontal sections 210 via hinge elements 236. Locking feature 234 includes a U-shaped element 238, hinge pins 240, and push tabs 242. When push tabs 242 engage apertures on U-shaped element 238, first horizontal section 202 is locked in a straight condition. Hinge elements 236 and hinge pins 240 also enable first horizontal section 202 to be collapsed when push tabs 242 are pressed in to disengage the apertures of U-shaped element 238. Second horizontal section 204 includes two straight tubes 244 and a locking feature 246. Each straight tube 244 is pivotally coupled to a respective one of lower portions 222 via hinge elements 248. Locking feature 246 includes a U-shaped element 250, hinge pins 252, and push tabs 254, and operates similar to locking feature 234 described above. Hinge elements 248 and hinge pins 252 enable second horizontal section 204 to be selectively locked or collapsed when push tabs 254 are engaged or disengaged from apertures in U-shaped element 250. Seat engaging structures 206 are adapted to universally engage various sized bleacher/bench type seats including, for example, seat 102 of FIG. 1. As shown, seat engaging structures 206 are pivotally coupled to lower portions 222 of vertical sections 208 via hinge pins 230. In the example embodiment, seat engaging structures 206 also function as arm rests. FIG. 3 is a side view of seat engaging structure 206. Seat engaging structure 206 includes a first portion 300 and a second portion 302. In the example embodiment, first portion 300 and second portion 302 are formed from bent tubing. The outer diameter of first portion 300 is less than the inner diameter of second portion 302, so that an end of first portion 300 can fit into an end of second portion 302. As shown, a segment of first portion 300 is coaxially aligned with, and inserted in, second portion 302 such that first portion 300 and second portion 302 are coupled in a telescoping fashion. First portion 300 includes a bottom region 304 and a top region 306. Bottom region 304 is curved to facilitate engagement of the rear surface of seat 102. In addition, bottom region 304 includes a set of hooks 308 extending therefrom. Hooks 308 facilitate the securement of frame 106 to seat 102 via an elastic cord 110. As shown, elastic cord 110 urges lower portion 222 of vertical section 208 toward bottom region 304 of seat engaging structure 206, thereby securing vertical section 208 in an upright position. Top region 306 includes a push tab 310 for locking first portion 300 into second portion 302 by engaging apertures 316 in second portion 302. Second portion 302 includes a bottom region 312 and a top region 314. Bottom region 312 is adapted to engage the top surface of seat 102. Top region 314 is coaxially aligned to receive top region 306 of first portion 300. As shown, top region 314 includes a plurality of apertures 316 adapted to receive push tab 316. Apertures 316 and push tab 310, together, enable the distance between first portion 300 and second portion 302 to be changed so as to adjust to various seat depths (i.e., the dimension from the front of seat 102 to the rear of seat 102). The collapsing of frame 106 is described with reference to FIG. 4 and FIG. 5. First, push tabs 218 are simultaneously pressed in, thereby releasing horizontal sections 210 to pivot 90° downward about hinge elements 216. Next, vertical section 208 is collapsed by pressing push tabs 226 back through holes 224 and then urging upper portion 220 of vertical section 208 into lower portion 222 of vertical section 208. Then, both seat engaging structures 206 are pivoted upward 90° about hinge element 230 as shown in FIG. 4. Next, first horizontal section 202 and second horizontal section 204 are broken down by pressing in push tabs 242 and 254 (FIG. 5). With push tabs 242 and 254 pressed in, elements 238 and 250 are urged upward thereby drawing frame side structures 200 together. Finally, first portions 300 of seat engaging structures 206 are rotated back and folded inward as shown in FIG. 5. To hold frame 106 in a collapsed position, elastic cord 112 can be wrapped around frame 106 and looped back around hooks 308. FIG. 6 illustrates another feature of the present invention, whereby portable seat awning 100 is adapted to be mounted to a chair 600 via a bag 602. In this example, chair 600 is a foldable lawn chair that includes a set of legs 604, a set of armrests 606, a seat 608, and a backrest 610. Bag 602 facilitates the transportation of portable seat awning 100 and also facilitates the coupling of portable seat awning 100 to chair 600. Bag 602 includes an open end 612, a bottom end 614, and a set of sleeves 616. Open end 612 is sufficiently large so that portable seat awning 100 can be placed into bag 602. Additionally, open end 612 is designed to receive backrests of a variety of different sized chairs, such as backrest 610 of chair 600. Open end 612 is closable via a pull string 618. Each of sleeves 616 is formed on a respective side of bag 602 by, for example, stitching 620 that extends completely down each side of bag 602. As shown, bottom ends 614 of sleeves 616 are both open so as to receive upper portions 220 of vertical sections 208. Optionally, sleeves 616 can be fixed to the rear side of bag 602. FIG. 7 shows a perspective view of portable seat awning 100 mounted to chair 600 via bag 602. The mounting of portable seat awning 100 to chair 600 via bag 602 is described as follows example. First, the top half of portable awning 100 is separated from the bottom half. That is, upper portions 220 of vertical sections 208 are removed from lower portions 222 of vertical sections 208, by pressing push tabs 226 into holes 224 while upper portions 220 and lower portions 222 are pulled in opposite directions. (See FIG. 2) Thus, seat engaging structures 206 (FIG. 2) are removed from frame 106. Then, bag 602 is placed onto chair 600 by positioning open end 612 of bag 602 around backrest 610 of chair 600. Finally, each of upper portions 220 of vertical sections 208 are inserted into a respective one of sleeves 616 as shown. FIG. 8 and FIG. 9 illustrate another embodiment of the present invention, wherein portable seat awning 100 is adapted to be mounted to chair 600 via a fabric awning support 800. FIG. 8 shows an exploded perspective view of portable seat awning 100 removed from chair 600. FIG. 9 shows a perspective view of portable seat awning 100 coupled to chair 600. In this example, awning support. 800 facilitates the coupling of portable seat awning 100 to chair 600. Awning support 800 includes a front region 802 and a back region 804 fastened to one another via hook-and-loop fasteners 806. During use, front region 802 and back region 804 cover (at least partially) the front and back, respectively, of backrest 610 of chair 600. Back region 804 includes a set of sleeves 808 that are adapted to receive upper portions 220 of vertical sections 208. As shown in this example, each of upper portions 220 of vertical sections 208 further includes a telescoping extension 810. Each of extensions 810 is adapted to receive a respective one of upper portions 220. Each of extensions 810 also includes a set of holes 812 that are adapted to receive a push spring 814 of upper portion 220. Accordingly, the length of upper portions 220 and, therefore, the vertical height of awning 100 are adjustable by pressing in push springs 814 and sliding upper portions 220 into and out of telescoping extensions 810. FIGS. 10A through 10C illustrate the manufacturing of awning support 800. First, as shown in FIG. 10A, a fabric blank 1000 is provided. Fabric blank 1000 includes a first region 1002 and a second region 1004, which are integral parts of a single piece of fabric. First region 1002 has attached a set of hook fasteners 1006 that are adapted to mate with a set of loop fasteners 1008 that are attached on second region 1004. Accordingly, hook fasteners 1006 and loop fasteners 1008, together, form hook and loop fasteners 806 (shown in FIG. 8). Second region 1004 includes a middle region 1010 and a set of side regions 1012 extending outwardly therefrom. Next, as shown in FIG. 10B, a first one of sleeves 808 is formed. That is, one of side regions 1012 of second region 1004 is folded back along a folding line 1014 (shown in FIG. 10A). Then, the outer edge of the folded one of side regions 1012 is attached to middle region 1010 via stitching 1016, which also closes the bottom of sleeve 808. Finally, as shown in FIG. 10C, a second one of sleeves 808 is formed. That is, the other of side regions 1012 of second region 1004 is folded back along the other one of folding tines 1014. Then, the outer edge of the other one of the side regions 1012 is attached to middle region 1010 via stitching 1016, which also closes the bottom of the second one of sleeves 808. It should be recognized that first region 1002 and second region 1004 of blank 1000 are formed into front region 802 and a back region 804 of awning support 800. Once complete, awning support 800 can be attached to chair 600 by draping awning support over backrest 610 of chair 600 such that front region 802 and back region 804 are folded along a fold line 1018. When draped over backrest 610, fold line 1018 should engage the top of backrest 610. With front region 802 and back region 804 engaging the front and back, respectively, of backrest 610, hook fasteners 1006 are coupled to loop fasteners 1008. Once awning support 800 is coupled to chair 600, telescoping extensions 810 can be inserted into sleeves 808. The description of particular embodiments of the present invention is now complete. Many of the described features may be substituted, altered or omitted without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, alternate structural elements (e.g., square stock, angle stock, etc.), may be substituted for the extruded tubular structural elements shown. As another example, alternate fabric types may be substituted for the opaque wind/rain proof fabric 104.
