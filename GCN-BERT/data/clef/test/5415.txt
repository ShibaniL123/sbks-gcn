Technical Field The present invention relates to a steel sheet for hot press-forming which is suited for producing automobile parts such as chassis and body structures by hot press-forming technique, a hot press-formed part produced using the steel sheet for hot press-forming, and a method for producing the hot press-formed part using the steel sheet for hot press-forming. Background Art Many automobile parts such as chassis and body structures are conventionally produced by press-forming steel sheets having prescribed strength at a room temperature. In recent years, the weight reduction of automobile body has been desired from the viewpoint of the preservation of global environment. Thus, there have been continuous efforts to decrease the thickness of steel sheet used for automobile parts by increasing the strength of steel sheet. However, increasing the strength of steel sheet is accompanied by a decrease in press-formability of steel sheet and it is frequently difficult to press-form such a steel sheet into automobile parts with desired shapes. To remedy this difficulty, Patent Literature 1 proposes a technique in which a steel sheet that has been heated is press-formed with a mold composed of a die and a punch while being simultaneously rapidly cooled. This technique, called a hot press-forming, realizes good press-formability of a high strength steel sheet. However, this hot press-forming involves heating of a steel sheet to a high temperature of about 950°C before the press-forming. As a result, scales (iron oxides) are formed on the surface of the steel sheet. Such scales are peeled off during the hot press-forming to damage the mold or damage the surface of hot press-formed parts. Further, scales remaining on the surface of the parts deteriorate the appearance or decrease the paint adhesiveness. Thus, the surface of such parts is usually descaled by treatments such as pickling or shot blasting. However, the implementation of these treatments makes the producing steps complicated and decreases the productivity. Such automobile parts as chassis and body structures require excellent corrosion resistance, but the hot press-formed parts produced through the above treatments show significantly insufficient corrosion resistance due to the fact that they are not provided with an anticorrosion film such as a coating layer. Thus, there has been a demand for a hot press-forming technique which can suppress the formation of scales during heating before hot press-forming and also can increase the corrosion resistance of hot press-formed parts. This has led to proposals of steel sheets having a film such as a coating layer on the surface, and hot press-forming methods using such steel sheets. For example, Patent Literature 2 discloses a method for producing a hot press-formed part excellent in corrosion resistance in which a steel sheet coated with Zn or Zn-based alloy is hot press-formed so that Zn-Fe-based compound or Zn-Fe-Al-based compound is formed on the surface of the part. Patent Literature 3 discloses a hot press-formed article (part) excellent in formability, weldability, and corrosion resistance that is obtained by heating a galvannealed steel sheet at 700°C to 1000°C for 2 to 20 minutes and hot press-forming the steel sheet to form a coating layer containing Fe-Zn solid solution phase on the surface of the article. Patent Literature 4 discloses a steel sheet for hot press-forming excellent in paint adhesiveness and perforation corrosion resistance after heating which is manufactured by forming a Zn-Ni coating layer on the surface of a coating layer I mainly containing Ni, and further by forming a compound layer containing, for example, Si, Ti, Al, and Zr thereon. Citation List Patent Literature PTL 1: United Kingdom Patent Publication No. 1490535 PTL 2: Japanese Patent No. 3663145 PTL 3: Japanese Patent No. 4039548 PTL 4: Japanese Patent No. 4883240 Summary of Invention Technical Problem However, the hot press-formed part described in Patent Literatures 2 and 3 often exhibits low resistance against perforation corrosion (hereinafter, called perforation corrosion resistance) which tends to occur at portions where chemical conversion films or electrodeposited films are not fully formed. Although a hot press-formed part excellent in perforation corrosion resistance can be obtained using the steel sheet for hot press-forming described in Patent Literature 4, a hot-pressed part can be further preferably applied in a part which is subjected to severe corrosive environment, if the perforation corrosion resistance of the hot press-formed part can be further improved, and if sufficient joint corrosion resistance can be additionally achieved. An object of the present invention is to provide a steel sheet for hot press-forming which is necessary for producing a hot press-formed part excellent in perforation corrosion resistance and joint corrosion resistance in a severe environment, a hot press-formed part produced using the steel sheet for hot press-forming, and a method for producing a hot press-formed part using the steel sheet for hot press-forming. Solution to Problem The present inventors carried out extensive studies with respect to the above target steel sheet for hot press-forming. As a result, the present inventors have obtained the finding described in item (ii) below on the basis of item (i) below. (i) The hot press-formed part produced using a steel sheet provided with a coating layer composed of Zn or a Zn-based alloy described in Patent Literatures 2 or 3 is poor in perforation corrosion resistance because there is a significant decrease in sacrificial anticorrosive effect which Zn primarily has due to Zn in the coating layer being diffused into a base steel sheet and taken into an Fe-Zn solid solution phase or due to a large amount of Zn oxides being formed on the surface of the coating layer when heating is performed before hot press-forming.(ii) By forming a Si-containing compound layer mainly containing a special silicone resin on the zinc coating layer, since Zn in the zinc coating layer and the Si-containing compound form a complex compound (Zn2SiO4) when heating is performed before hot press-forming, it is possible to achieve excellent perforation corrosion resistance and joint corrosion resistance. The present invention has been made on the basis of the finding described above and provides a steel sheet for hot press-forming having a zinc coating layer and a Si-containing compound layer in this order on a base steel sheet, in which the Si-containing compound layer contains a silicone resin having an organic functional group of a carbon number of 4 or more. In the steel sheet for hot press-forming of the present invention, it is preferable that the Si-containing compound layer further contains a silane coupling agent, in which the compounding ratio of the silicone resin and the silane coupling agent is 5/5 or more in terms of mass ratio (silicone resin/silane coupling agent). In the steel sheet for hot press-forming of the present invention, it is preferable that the zinc coating layer consists of a coating layer I and a coating layer II in this order on the base steel sheet, in which the coating layer I contains 60 mass% or more of Ni and the balance being Zn and inevitable impurities and has a coating weight of 0.01 g/m2 or more and 5 g/m2 or less, and the coating layer II contains 10 mass% or more and 25 mass% or less of Ni and the balance being Zn and inevitable impurities and has a coating weight of 10 g/m2 or more and 90 g/m2 or less. In the steel sheet for hot press-forming of the present invention, it is preferable that the base steel sheet has a chemical composition consisting of, by mass%, C: 0.15% or more and 0.5% or less, Si: 0.05% or more and 2.0% or less, Mn: 0.5% or more and 3% or less, P: 0.1% or less, S: 0.05% or less, Al: 0.10% or less, N: 0.010% or less, and the balance being Fe and inevitable impurities. In the steel sheet for hot press-forming of the present invention, it is preferable that the chemical composition described above further contains, by mass%, at least one selected from Cr: 0.01% or more and 1% or less, Ti: 0.20% or less, and B: 0.0005% or more and 0.08% or less. In the steel sheet for hot press-forming of the present invention, it is preferable that the chemical composition described above further contains, by mass%, Sb: 0.003% or more and 0.03% or less. The present invention also provides a hot press-formed part produced by heating the steel sheet for hot press-forming of the present invention, and hot press-forming the heated steel sheet, in which a diffraction peak of Zn2SiO4 in the vicinity of 2θ=36.1 degrees having a peak intensity of 0.20 kcps or more is observed when an X-ray diffraction intensity measurement is performed on the surface of the hot press-formed part. The present invention also provides a method for producing a hot press-formed part including heating the steel sheet for hot press-forming of the present invention described above to a temperature in the range of Ac3 transformation point to 1000°C, and hot press-forming the heated steel sheet. In the method for producing a hot press-formed part of the present invention, it is preferable that the steel sheet be heated at an average heating rate of 100°C/s or more to a temperature of in the range of Ac3 transformation point to 1000°C. Advantageous Effects of Invention Using the steel sheet for hot press-forming according to the present invention, it is possible to obtain a hot press-formed part excellent in perforation corrosion resistance and joint corrosion resistance in a severe environment. A hot press-formed part produced using the steel sheet for hot press-forming of the present invention and using the method for producing a hot press-formed part of the present invention can be preferably used for automobile parts such as chassis and body structures. Description of Embodiments The embodiment of the present invention will be described hereafter. Here, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described below. 1) Steel sheet for hot press-forming The steel sheet for hot press-forming according to the present invention has a zinc coating layer which is formed on the surface of a base steel sheet and a Si-containing compound layer which is formed on the zinc coating layer. Methods for forming the Si-containing compound layer and the zinc coated layer, and methods for manufacturing the base steel sheet and the steel sheet for hot press-forming will be described hereafter. 1-1) Si-containing compound layer The Si-containing compound layer contains a silicone resin having an organic functional group of a carbon number of 4 or more. The silicone resin is a resin having a siloxane unit in a resin skeleton. The silicone resin also includes not only a resin having a siloxane unit alone but also a resin having a siloxane unit and a unit other than a siloxane (such as an organic compound unit containing, for example, C, H, N, O). Examples of the organic functional group described above include a phenyl group, a glycidoxypropyl group, a styryl group, a methacryloxypropyl group, an acryloxypropyl group, an aminoethyl-aminopropyl group, and an ureidopropyl group. Also, the organic functional group of a carbon number of 4 or more which is modified by, for example, epoxy modification, alkyd modification, polyester modification, or acryl modification may be used. Such a silicone resin combines with Zn in a zinc coating layer described below to form Zn2SiO4 at hot press-forming. On the other hand, in the case where a silicone resin having an organic functional group of a carbon number of 3 or less, silane coupling agent, or an inorganic Si-containing compound (such as lithium silicate, sodium silicate, or colloidal silica) is used, Zn2SiO4 is scarcely formed. Therefore, in the case where a silicone resin having an organic functional group of a carbon number of 3 or less is used, the improvement of perforation corrosion resistance and joint corrosion resistance in a severe corrosive environment can scarcely be realized. In addition, in the case where, for example, a Ti-containing compound, an Al-containing compound, or a Zr-containing compound is used instead of a Si-containing compound, no complex compound is formed, or, even if a complex compound is formed, the complex compound has no effect of improving perforation corrosion resistance and joint corrosion resistance which a Si-containing complex compound has. It can be confirmed whether or not Zn2SiO4 is formed at hot press-forming, by heating the steel sheet for hot press-forming, hot press-forming the heated steel sheet, and measuring an X-ray diffraction intensity on the surface of the hot pres-formed part using an X-ray diffraction method. The heating in this case is substantially the same as the heating which the steel sheet for hot press-forming according to the present invention receives at actual hot press-forming. Specifically, regarding the heating described above, it is preferable that the heating be performed in a manner such that a maximum steel sheet temperature is in a range of Ac3 transformation point to 1000°C and that a holding time at the maximum steel sheet temperature be 300 seconds or less. It can be confirmed that Zn2SiO4 is formed in a steel sheet for hot press-forming at hot press-forming, by heating the steel sheet for hot press-forming, hot press-forming the heated steel sheet, measuring the X-ray diffraction intensity on the surface of the hot press-formed part using an X-ray diffraction method, and observing a diffraction peak of Zn2SiO4 in the vicinity of 2θ=36.1 degrees having a peak intensity of 0.20 kcps or more. The measurement of X-ray diffraction intensity is performed using Cu-Kα ray under the condition that Kβ ray is removed using a graphite single-crystal monochrometer. In the case where the diffraction peak of Zn2SiO4 is observed in the vicinity of 2θ=36.1 degrees and where the peak intensity is 0.20 kcps or more, preferably 0.30 kcps or more, there is a significant effect of improving perforation corrosion resistance. On the other hand, in the case where the peak intensity is less than 0.20 kcps, there is substantially no effect of improving perforation corrosion resistance and joint corrosion resistance. Here, when "heating a steel sheet for hot press-forming", in the case where the condition that the peak intensity described above is 0.20 kcps or more is not satisfied even if the heating has been performed under one heating condition selected from ranges in which the maximum steel sheet temperature is Ac3 transformation point to 1000°C and in which the holding time at the maximum steel sheet temperature is 300 seconds or less, if the condition for the peak intensity described above is satisfied under another heating condition selected from the ranges for the maximum steel sheet temperature and the holding time described above, the steel sheet for hot press-forming is regarded as a steel sheet for hot press-forming according to the present invention. As described above, when the steel sheet for hot press-forming is heated, Zn2SiO4 is formed in a Si-containing compound layer. The steel sheet for hot press-forming which has been heated once and in which Zn2SiO4 is formed in a Si-containing compound layer and the steel sheet for hot press-forming which has not been heated yet and in which Zn2SiO4 is not formed in a Si-containing compound layer are both regarded as a steel sheet for hot press-forming according to the present invention. There is no particular limitation on the thickness of a Si-containing compound layer, and the thickness may be appropriately controlled. It is preferable that the thickness of a Si-containing compound layer be 0.1 µm or more from a view point of increasing of the paint adhesiveness. In addition, it is more preferable that the thickness of a Si-containing compound layer be 3.0 µm or less, because there is no case where there is a decrease in paint adhesiveness due to the Si-containing compound layer becoming brittle. It is further more preferable that the thickness be 0.4 µm or more and 2.0 µm or less. There is no particular limitation on the content of a silicone resin which is contained in a Si-containing compound layer. It is preferable that the content of a silicone resin be 50 mass% or more and 100 mass% or less from a view point of sufficient improvement of perforation corrosion resistance and joint corrosion resistance. It is more preferable that the content be 80 mass% or more and 100 mass% or less. A Si-containing compound layer may contain components other than a silicone resin described above as long as the effect of the present invention is not injured. For example, in the present invention, it is preferable that a Si-containing compound layer contains a silane coupling agent. In the case where a silane coupling agent is contained in the Si-containing compound layer, since Zn2SiO4 is likely to be formed compared with the case where a Si-containing compound other than a silane coupling agent (such as lithium silicate), a Ti-containing compound, or a Zr-containing compound is contained in the Si-containing compound layer, the improvement of perforation corrosion resistance can be realized. In the case where a Si-containing compound layer contains a silane coupling agent, it is preferable that the compound ratio with respect to the content of a silicone resin, that is, a mass ratio (silicone resin/silane coupling agent) be 5/5 or more. In the case where the mass ratio described above is 5/5 or more, since there is a sufficient amount of Zn2SiO4 formed after heating, for example, after hot press-forming, it is possible to obtain a hot press-formed part significantly excellent in perforation corrosion resistance and joint corrosion resistance even in a severe corrosive environment. In addition, it is preferable that a silane coupling agent also has an organic functional group of a carbon number of 4 or more from a view point of improvement of perforation corrosion resistance and joint corrosion resistance. Examples of components other than a silane coupling agent include an inorganic Si-containing compound, a Ti-containing compound, an Al-containing compound, and a Zr-containing compound. In addition, inorganic solid lubricant may be preferably added in a Si-containing compound layer. Since there is a decrease in dynamic friction coefficient when hot press-forming is performed by adding an inorganic solid lubricant, there is an increase in press-formability. As an inorganic solid lubricant, at least one selected from a metal sulfide (such as molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide), a selenium compound (such as molybdenum selenide and tungsten selenide), graphite, a fluoride (such as graphite fluoride and calcium fluoride), a nitride (such as boron nitride and silicon nitride), borax, mica, metal tin, and an alkali metal sulfate (such as sodium sulfate and calcium sulfate) may be added. It is preferable that the content of an inorganic solid lubricant in a Si-containing compound layer be 0.1 mass% or more and 20 mass% or less. That is because a sufficient lubrication effect can be realized in the case where the content of an inorganic solid lubricant is 0.1 mass% or more, and because there is no decrease in paint adhesiveness in the case where the content is 20 mass% or less. 1-2) Zinc coating layer The Zn described above which is contained in Zn2SiO4 is Zn which was contained in a zinc coating layer. Therefore, there is no particular limitation on what kind of zinc coating layer is used as long as the coating layer contains Zn. For example, any kind of zinc coating such as pure zinc coating, alloyed zinc coating, zinc-nickel alloy coating, or zinc-aluminum alloy coating may be used. In addition, the zinc coating layer may be a single layer or a multiple layer. In the case of a multiple layer, it is appropriate that the outermost layer contains Zn. In the present invention, it is preferable that the zinc coating layer has a coating layer I and a coating layer II in this order on a base steel sheet. The details of the coating layer I and the coating layer II will be described below. The coating layer I contains 60 mass% or more of Ni and the balance being Zn and inevitable impurities and has a coating weight of 0.01 g/m2 or more and 5 g/m2 or less. In the present invention, due to the coating layer I containing 60 mass% or more of Ni and the balance being Zn and inevitable impurities, since the diffusion of Zn in the coating layer into the base steel sheet can be suppressed, excellent perforation corrosion resistance can be given to a hot press-formed part. Although it is preferable that the Ni content in the coating layer I be 100 mass%, in the case where the content is less than 100 mass%, the balance is set to be Zn having a sacrificial anticorrosive effect and inevitable impurities. Here, in the case where the zinc coating layer in the present invention is a multiple layer as described above, it is acceptable that layers other than the outermost layer do not contain Zn. In addition, in the case where the coating weight of the coating layer I is 0.01 g/m2 or more, the effect of preventing Zn from diffusing into the base steel sheet can be sufficiently realized, and, in the case where the coating layer is 5 g/m2 or less, there is substantially no disadvantage related to an excessive increase in manufacturing cost. The coating layer II is formed on the coating layer I in order to give excellent perforation corrosion resistance to a hot press-formed part by suppressing the formation of a large amount of zinc oxides on the surface of the coating layer. The coating layer II is a coating layer containing 10 mass% or more and 25 mass% or less of Ni and the balance being Zn and inevitable impurities. Due to 10 mass% or more and 25 mass% or less of Ni, the coating layer II has a crystal structure of Ni2Zn11, NiZn3, or Ni5Zn21, and a γ phase having a high melting point of 881°C is formed in the coating layer II. As a result, a zinc oxide-forming reaction on the surface of the zinc coating layer at heating can be suppressed to a minimum degree. Moreover, since a γ phase is retained in the coating layer II even after hot press-forming, the hot press-formed steel sheet exhibits excellent perforation corrosion resistance due to the sacrificial anticorrosive effect of Zn. Here, the formation of a γ phase with a Ni content of 10 mass% or more and 25 mass% or less is not necessarily in accordance with the Ni-Zn alloy equilibrium diagram. This is thought to be because a reaction for forming a coating layer which occurs in, for example, an electric coating process proceeds in a non-equilibrium state. A γ phase composed of Ni2Zn11, NiZn3, or Ni5Zn21 can be confirmed by an X-ray diffraction method or an electron diffraction method using a TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy). In addition, due to 10 mass% or more and 25 mass% or less of Ni, a γ phase is formed in the coating layer II as described above. In addition, under some electric coating conditions, a small amount of η phase may be mixed in the coating layer II. In this case, it is preferable that the η phase content be 5 mass% or less in order to suppress a zinc oxide-forming reaction on the surface of the zinc coating layer at heating to a minimum degree. The η phase content is defined as a mass ratio of the amount of a η phase with respect to the total amount of the coating layer II and can be determined using, for example, an anodic dissolution method. In the case where the coating weight per side of the coating layer II is 10 g/m2 or more, the sacrificial anticorrosive effect of Zn can be sufficiently realized, and, in the case where the coating weight per side is 90 g/m2 or less, there is substantially no disadvantage related to an excessive increase in manufacturing cost. 1-3) Base steel sheet There is no particular limitation on what chemical composition which a base steel sheet should have or on the content of each chemical element of the chemical composition. In order to obtain a hot press-formed part having a tensile strength (TS) of 980 MPa or more, for example, a hot-rolled steel sheet or a cold-rolled steel sheet having a chemical composition consisting of, by mass%, C: 0.15% or more and 0.5% or less, Si: 0.05% or more and 2.0% or less, Mn: 0.5% or more and 3% or less, P: 0.1% or less, S: 0.05% or less, Al: 0.10% or less, N: 0.010% or less, and the balance being Fe and inevitable impurities is preferably used as a base steel sheet. The reason for the limitation on the contents of these chemical elements will be described hereafter. Here, "%" used when describing the content of each chemical element represents "mass%", unless otherwise noted. C: 0.15% or more and 0.5% or less C is a chemical element which increases strength of steel. In order to control the tensile strength (TS) of a hot press-formed part to be 980 MPa or more, it is necessary that the C content be 0.15% or more. On the other hand, in the case where the C content is 0.5% or less, the base steel sheet has blanking workability of a certain level or higher. Therefore, the C content is set to be 0.15% or more and 0.5% or less. Si: 0.05% or more and 2.0% or less Si is, like C, a chemical element which increases strength of steel. In order to control the TS of a hot press-formed part to be 980 MPa or more, it is necessary that the Si content be 0.05% or more. On the other hand, in the case where the Si content is 2.0% or less, surface defect called red scale hardly occurs and there is substantially no increase in rolling load at hot rolling, and the hot-rolled steel sheet has sufficient ductility. Moreover, in the case where the Si content is 2.0% or less, a negative effect on coating properties is less likely to occur when coating treatment for forming a coating film mainly containing Zn is performed on the surface of steel sheet. Therefore, the Si content is set to be 0.05% or more and 2.0% or less. Mn: 0.5% or more and 3% or less Mn is a chemical element which is effective for improving hardenability of steel by suppressing ferrite transformation. In addition, since Mn lowers the Ac3 transformation point, Mn is a chemical element which is effective for decreasing a heating temperature before hot press-forming. It is necessary that the Mn content be 0.5% or more in order to realize such effects. On the other hand, in the case where the Mn content is 3% or less, a decrease in the uniformity of properties of a base steel sheet and a hot press-formed part is less likely to occur. Therefore, the Mn content is set to be 0.5% or more and 3% or less. P: 0.1% or less In the case where the P content is 0.1% or less, a decrease in the uniformity of properties of a base steel sheet and a hot press-formed part is less likely to occur, and sufficient toughness is achieved. Therefore, the P content is set to be 0.1% or less. S: 0.05% or less In the case where the S content is 0.05% or less, a hot press-part part has sufficient toughness. Therefore, the S content is set to be 0.05% or less. Al: 0.10% or less In the case where the Al content is 0.10% or less, a base steel sheet has excellent blanking workability and excellent hardenability. Therefore, the Al content is set to be 0.10% or less. N: 0.010% or less In the case where the N content is 0.010% or less, since AlN is less likely to be formed at hot rolling or heating before hot press-forming, a base steel sheet has excellent blanking workability and excellent hardenability. Therefore, the N content is set to be 0.010% or less. The balance of the chemical composition is Fe and inevitable impurities. In addition, as the reason will be described below, it is preferable that the chemical composition further contains at least one selected from Cr: 0.01% or more and 1% or less, Ti: 0.20% or less, and B: 0.0005% or more and 0.08% or less and/or Sb: 0.003% or more and 0.03% or less. Cr: 0.01% or more and 1% or less Cr is a chemical element which is effective for strengthening steel and for improving hardenability. It is preferable that the Cr content be 0.01% or more in order to realize such effects. On the other hand, since there is substantially no disadvantage related to an excessive increase in manufacturing cost in the case where the Cr content is 1% or less, it is preferable that the upper limit of the Cr content be 1%. Ti: 0.20% or less Ti is a chemical element which is effective for strengthening steel and for increasing toughness by decreasing a grain size of steel. Also, Ti is a chemical element which is effective for realizing the effect of increasing hardenability through the use of solid solute B, because Ti forms nitrides more readily than B which will be described next. However, in the case where the Ti content is 0.20% or less, rolling load at hot rolling is less likely to increase and the toughness of a hot press-formed part is less likely to decrease. It is preferable that the upper limit of the Ti content be 0.20%. B: 0.0005% or more and 0.08% or less B is a chemical element which is effective for improving hardenability at hot press-forming and for improving toughness after hot press-forming. It is preferable that the B content be 0.0005% or more in order to realize such effects. On the other hand, in the case where the B content is 0.08% or less, rolling load is less likely to increase at hot rolling, and cracks of steel sheet are less likely to occur because a martensite phase or a bainite phase is less likely to be formed after hot rolling. It is preferable that the upper limit of the B content be 0.08%. Sb: 0.003% or more and 0.03% or less Sb is effective for suppressing the formation of decarburization layer in the surface portion of steel sheet during hot press-forming process from heating before hot press-forming to cooling after hot press-forming. It is necessary that the Sb content be 0.003% or more in order to realize such an effect. On the other hand, in the case where the Sb content is 0.03% or less, since rolling load is less likely to increase, productivity is less likely to decrease. Therefore, the Sb content is set to be 0.003% or more and 0.03% or less. 1-4) Method for manufacturing a steel sheet for hot press-forming First, a zinc coating layer is formed on the base steel sheet described above. There is no particular limitation on what method is used to form a zinc coating layer, and a common method such as a galvanization treatment or an electric zinc coating treatment is available. In addition, there is no particular limitation on what treatment conditions are used, and common conditions may be used. Even in the case where a coating layer I is formed on the base steel sheet and a coating layer II is further formed on the coating layer I, there is no particular limitation on what coating method and conditions are used. Subsequently, in order to form a Si-containing compound layer on the zinc coating layer, it is appropriate that a treatment solution containing a Si-containing compound mainly containing at least one selected from the silicone resins described above is deposited onto the surface of the zinc coating layer and then dried by heating without performing water washing. Since there is no particular limitation on what method is used to deposit the treatment solution containing a Si-containing compound onto the zinc coating layer, any one of painting method, immersion method, and spraying method may be used, and a roll coater, a squeeze coater, or a die coater may be used. In this case, after a painting treatment, for example, using a squeeze coater, an immersion treatment, or a spraying treatment has been performed, deposition amount control, appearance homogenization, and thickness uniformization may also be performed using an air knife method or a squeeze roll method. In addition, it is preferable that drying by heating be performed so that the maximum steel sheet temperature is 40°C to 200°C, more preferably 60°C to 160°C. 1-5) Other embodiments In the case of the steel sheet for press-forming according to the present invention, since it is appropriate that a zinc coating layer and a Si-containing compound layer be formed in this order on a base steel sheet, other layers may be formed between the base steel sheet and the zinc coating layer and between the zinc coating layer and the Si-containing compound layer as long as there is no decrease in the effect of the present invention. 2) Method for producing a hot press-formed part The steel sheet for hot press-forming according to the present invention described above is heated to a temperature in the range of Ac3 transformation point to 1000°C, and then press-formed into a hot press-formed part. The steel sheet is heated to the Ac3 transformation point or above before hot press-forming in order that hard phases such as a martensite phase are formed by rapid cooling during hot press-forming and thereby the hot press-formed part attains a high strength. The upper limit of the heating temperature is set to be 1000°C because a large amount of zinc oxides are formed on the surface of the zinc coating layer at a heating temperature higher than 1000°C, and therefore excellent perforation corrosion resistance is less likely to be achieved. Here, "heating temperature" refers to a maximum steel sheet temperature that is reached during heating. In addition, in the case where an average heating rate during heating before hot press-forming is 100°C/s or more, since the formation of zinc oxides on the surface of the zinc coating layer is suppressed, there is an increase in perforation corrosion resistance. This is because, although the amount of zinc oxides formed on the surface of the zinc coating layer increases with increasing holding time at a high temperature for which a steel sheet is subjected to a high temperature, since the holding time at a high temperature decreases with increasing an average heating rate, the formation of zinc oxides on the surface of the zinc coating layer is subsequently suppressed. Here, there is no particular limitation on the holding time at the maximum steel sheet temperature. The holding time described above is preferably as short as possible in order to suppress the formation of zinc oxides described above, and it is preferable that the holding time be 300 seconds or less, more preferably 60 seconds or less, further more preferably 10 seconds or less. Examples of the heating method before hot press-forming include heating with, for example, an electric furnace or a gas furnace, flame heating, energization heating, high-frequency heating, and inductive heating. In particular, for example, energization heating, high-frequency heating, or inductive heating is preferable in order to control an average heating rate to be 100°C/s or more. By setting the steel sheet for hot press-forming which has been heated as described above onto a mold which is composed of a die and a punch, and press-forming the heated steel sheet, followed by cooling under a desired cooling condition, a hot press-formed part is produced. 3) Hot press-formed part Since Zn2SiO4 is formed on the surface of the hot press-formed part which has been produced as described above, the hot press-formed part has excellent perforation corrosion resistance and joint corrosion resistance in a severe environment and excellent paint adhesiveness. EXAMPLES The present invention will be described further in detail using examples hereafter, but the present invention is not limited to the examples below. A cold-rolled steel sheet having a chemical composition consisting of, by mass%, C: 0.23%, Si: 0.25%, Mn: 1.2%, P: 0.01%, S: 0.01%, Al: 0.03%, N: 0.005%, Cr, 0.20%, Ti: 0.02%, B: 0.0022%, Sb: 0.008%, and the balance being Fe and inevitable impurities, an Ac3 transformation point of 820°C, and a thickness of 1.6 mm was used as a base steel sheet. Zinc coating layers I having various Ni contents and coating weights were formed on the surface of the cold-rolled steel sheet by performing an electric zinc coating treatment in a coating bath containing 200 g/L of nickel sulfate hexahydrate and 0 to 50 g/L of zinc sulfate heptahydrate and having a pH of 3.0 and a temperature of 50°C with a current density of 5 to 100 A/dm2. Subsequently, zinc coating layers II having various Ni contents, coating weights, and η phase contents were formed on the zinc coating layers I by performing an electric zinc coating treatment in a coating bath containing 200 g/L of nickel sulfate hexahydrate and 10 to 100 g/L of zinc sulfate heptahydrate and having a pH of 1.5 and a temperature of 50°C with a current density of 5 to 100 A/dm2. Here, in the case of the coating layers I and the coating layers II whose Ni contents are not 100 mass%, the balance other than Ni is Zn. The pH of the coating bath was adjusted by controlling the amount of sulfuric acid added. Subsequently, steel sheets Nos. 1 to 38 were prepared by applying compounds (having a solid content of 15 mass%) containing a Si-containing compound, an inorganic Si-containing compound, a Ti-containing compound, an Al-containing compound, a Zr-containing compound, or Si and Zr-containing compound and the balance being a solvent onto the coating layers II, and drying the applied compounds under the condition of maximum steel sheet temperature of 140°C in order to form any compound layers having the various thicknesses given in Tables 1 and 2 which were composed of a Si-containing compound, a Ti-containing compound, an Al-containing compound, a Zr-containing compound, or Si and Zr-containing compound on the coating layers II. In addition, steel No. 39 was prepared by forming a Si-containing compound layer on a galvannealed steel sheet (GA) which had been prepared by performing a galvanization treatment and an alloying treatment on the base steel sheet described above. Here, the compounds described below were used as a Si-containing compound, an inorganic Si-containing compound, a Ti-containing compound, an Al-containing compound, or a Zr-containing compound.

Here, in the case where a silicone resin was used as a compound, a thinner which was composed of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether and petroleum naphtha at a mass ratio (ethylene glycol monobutyl ether:petroleum naphtha) of 55:45 was used as a solvent. In addition, in the case where compounds other than a silicone resin were used, deionized water was used as a solvent. Products equivalent to hot press-formed parts were prepared by heating the steel sheets Nos. 1 to 39 having the coating layers I, the coating layers II, and the compound layers or a galvannealed layer and a compound layer using an electric furnace or a direct energization heating method under the heating conditions given in Tables 1 and 2, and cooling the heated steel sheets by inserting the heated the steel sheets into a mold made of Al at the cooling rates given in Tables 1 and 2. Using these products, the peak intensity evaluation of the diffraction peak of Zn2SiO4 using an X-ray diffraction method, the evaluation of perforation corrosion resistance and joint corrosion resistance, and the evaluation of paint adhesiveness were conducted. Peak intensity of the diffraction peak of Zn2SiO4 using an X-ray diffraction method Using the products equivalent to hot press-formed parts described above, diffraction intensity was evaluated using an X-ray diffraction method under the conditions described below. Measuring apparatus: Rotaflex produced by Riken Corporation Determining conditions X-ray used: Cu-Kα Removal of Kβ ray: graphite single-crystal monochrometer Scan speed: 4°/min Detector: scintillation counter Diffraction intensity of Zn2SiO4: the peak intensity of 2θ=36.1 degrees (113 plane) was evaluated Perforation corrosion resistance: in order to evaluate perforation corrosion resistance under the assumption that perforation corrosion tends to occur in a portion in which a sufficient amount of chemical conversion film or electrodeposited coating film is not formed, a sample (70 mm × 150 mm) was taken from each of the products equivalent to hot press-formed parts described above, and the surface which was not to be evaluated and the end faces were shielded with tapes. Subsequently, a composite corrosion test consisting of 200 cycles of salt spraying (5 mass% NaCl solution, 35°C, 2 h) → drying (60°C, relative humidity 20% to 30%, 4 h) → wetting (50°C, relative humidity 95%, 2 h) was conducted. By determining the maximum thickness reduction of the sample after the test had been performed, and by conducting evaluation on the basis of the judging criteria described below, a case marked using ⊙, ○, or Δ was judged as a case where the object of the present invention was satisfied. ⊙: maximum thickness reduction ≤ 0.1 mm ○: 0.1 mm < maximum thickness reduction ≤ 0.2 mm Δ: 0.2 mm < maximum thickness reduction ≤ 0.3 mm x: 0.3 mm < maximum thickness reduction Paint adhesiveness: a sample (70 mm x 150 mm) was taken from each of the products equivalent to hot press-formed parts described above. Each sample was subjected to a chemical conversion treatment under standard conditions using PB-SX35 produced by Nihon Parkerizing CO., LTD. Subsequently, a painted sample was prepared by electrodepositing a painting film on the sample so that the film thickness was 20 µm using electrodeposition paint GT-10HT produced by Kansai Paint Co., Ltd. and baking the sample at a temperature of 170°C for a duration of 20 minutes. Then, a lattice pattern (10 × 10 squares with 1mm intervals) was formed on the surface which had been subjected to chemical conversion treatment and electrodepositing treatment using a cutter knife so that the depth of the lattice line reached the base steel sheet, and then a tape peeling test was conducted, in which an adhesive tape was stuck to the lattice pattern and then peeled. By conducting evaluation on the basis of the judgment criteria described below, a case marked using ⊙ or ○ was judged as a case where paint adhesiveness was excellent. ⊙: No squares were peeled off. ○: 1 to 10 squares were peeled off. Δ: 11 to 30 squares were peeled off. x: 31 or more squares were peeled off. Joint corrosion resistance: a large sample (70 mm x 150 mm) and a small sample (40 mm × 110 mm) were collected from each of the products equivalent to hot press-formed parts described above. Subsequently, the small sample was placed on the center of the large sample (joint), and joined together by welding. A chemical conversion treatment was performed on the joined sample using PB-SX35 manufactured by Nihon Parkerizing CO., LTD. Subsequently, a joint test piece was prepared by electrodepositing electrodeposition paint GT-10HT Gray manufactured by Kansai Paint Co., Ltd on the joined sample and baking the joined sample at a temperature of 170°C for 20 minutes so that the coating film thickness was 20 µm. Non-evaluated surfaces of the joint test piece were shielded with a tape. The joint test piece was then subjected to a composite corrosion test that included 200 cycles of salt spraying (5 mass% aqueous NaCl solution, 35°C, 2 h) → drying (60°C, relative humidity 20% to 30%, 4 h) → wetting (50°C, relative humidity 95%, 2 h). The welded portion of the joint test piece was drilled and the joint test piece was disassembled. The maximum corrosion depth in the joint was measured evaluated based on the following criteria. The object of the present invention is satisfied when the evaluation is ⊙, ○ or Δ. ⊙: maximum corrosion depth ≤ 0.1 mm ○: 0.1 mm < maximum corrosion depth ≤ 0.2 mm Δ: 0.2 mm < maximum corrosion depth ≤ 0.4 mm x: 0.4 mm < maximum corrosion depth The results are given in Tables 1 and 2.
