BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The immune system functions to protect the body against harmful antigens, bacteria, viruses, toxins, blood or tissues from another person or species, and cancer cells. Immune system disorders can lead to hyperactivity or hypoactivity of the immune system. In cases of immune system hyperactivity, the body attacks and damages its own tissues. In cases of immune system hypoactivity, also known as immune deficiency, the body's ability to fight foreign antigens is diminished, which often leads to a greater vulnerability to infections. The enzyme arginase metabolizes L-arginine to L-ornithine and urea. Besides its fundamental role in the hepatic urea cycle, arginase is expressed in some cells of the immune system of some mammals. However, it is unclear if interferences with L-arginine metabolism can be used to treat immune conditions. Importantly, several challenges exist in formulating exogenous Arginases as a therapeutic agent that is suitable for clinical administration.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Most living beings are exposed to a number of different antigens every day. However some animals possess immune systems that are capable of responding to such antigens, and protecting against the initiation or formation of disease. To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of antigens, such as virus(es), parasitic worm(s), or allergen(s) and initiate a response in the body against foreign substances, abnormal cells and/or tissues. In a response to an unknown antigen, a healthy immune system begins to produce antibodies. In some diseases however, an immune system can start producing antibodies that instead of fighting infections, attack the body's own tissues. This can lead to autoimmune diseases. Cancerous growths, including malignant cancerous growths, can also be recognized by the innate immune cells of a subject and trigger an immune response. The activation of innate immune cells triggers numerous intracellular signaling pathways, which require tight control in order to mount an adequate immune response. Arginase I is a key element of the urea cycle, which converts arginine to urea, and is predominately active in the liver. Arginase I also play a functional role in the immune system. T-cells for instance are dependent on the semi-essential amino acid arginine to mature and respond to infections. Expression of Arginase I in innate immune cells leads to depletion of arginine levels from a physiological system under inflammatory conditions. For example, Arginase I expression in myeloid cells can lead to T-cell anergy and prevent T-helper cell functions. In mice, Arginase I is expressed by cells of monocytic origin. In humans, Arginase I is constitutively expressed in granulocytes/neutrophils and participates in fungicidal activity. Arginase I expressing macrophages are considered by some to be alternatively activated or M2 macrophages, involved in tissue regeneration and repair but also in the immune defense against multicellular pathogens and parasites. Arginase I expression in murine myeloid cells is regulated by Th2 cytokines IL-4/IL-13. However, it is unclear if human Arginase I and the murine Arginase I work by a similar mechanism of action. The PI3K/PTEN signaling pathway plays a functional role in numerous physiologically important processes such as innate immunity, cell survival, proliferation, migration and metabolism. The Phosphatidylinositol-3 Kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway can downregulate the expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in some cells. These signaling processes are strictly regulated by the lipid phosphatase PTEN, an antagonist of the PI3K pathway. PTEN is a tumor suppressor that is responsible for the elevated production of cytokines such as Interleukin 6 (IL-6) in response to Toll like receptor (TLR) agonists. PI3K activation is considered to be pro-inflammatory and modulation of the PI3K pathway is indispensable for proper guidance of immune cells to the site of infection or inflammation. We describe herein experiments characterizing the addition of recombinant pegylated Arginase Ito cultured cells and mouse models. The experiments demonstrate that extracellular Arginase I can exert potent anti-inflammatory effects on immune cells. Transfer experiments of conditioned media derived from naive PTEN−/− macrophages, containing high amounts of Arginase I, showed reduced expression of pro-inflammatory T-cell polarizing cytokines in cultured cells and animal models. The invention disclosed herein provides compositions and methods for treating conditions associated with the immune system by administrating recombinant Arginase I proteins to a subject to modulate the PI3K/PTEN signaling pathway and cytokine secretion. In some embodiments, the invention disclosed herein provides a method of modulating inflammation by administering to a subject a therapeutically-effective amount of a purified pegylated recombinant human Arginase I. The disclosure demonstrates that a functional consequence of sustained Arginase I expression in a physiological system is the formation of a hypo-inflammatory environment by diminished function of T-cell mediated pathophysiologic effects in vitro and in vivo. The finding provides a robust and effective method for the modulation of an immune system. Such modulation provides an effective treatment for a variety of immune conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, modulation of the immune system with a recombinant Arginase of the disclosure can be used alongside surgical procedures, for example, to provide a hypo-inflammatory environment that reduces the likelihood of cell/tissue rejection during organ transplantation. In some aspects, the disclosure provides a method of modulating inflammation, the method comprising administering to a subject a therapeutically-effective amount of a purified pegylated recombinant human Arginase I, or a functional fragment thereof. In some cases, the purified pegylated recombinant human Arginase I, or functional fragment thereof, modulates inflammation by inhibiting T-cell polarization. In some cases, the purified pegylated recombinant human Arginase I inhibits T-cell polarization by modulating cytokine release. Another aspect of the disclosure provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a purified recombinant human Arginase I protein conjugated to at least one polyethylene glycol oligomer. In some cases, the at least one polyethylene glycol oligomer is methoxy poly(ethylene glycol). The disclosure also demonstrates a functional role for Arginases in bone physiology. Bone formation is a multi-complex procedure that includes many stages, and each one of them presents as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Inflammation can also interfere with the ability of a vertebrate body to repair bone mass. In some aspects, the disclosure demonstrates that expression of Arginase I is lost during osteoclastogenesis, and addition of a recombinant Arginase I during osteoclast differentiation can modulate at least osteoclastogenesis. The disclosure also demonstrates that blockage if osteoclastogenesis is dependent on the catalytic functions of recombinant Arginase I. The findings suggest that modulation of Arginase expression can provide an effective treatment for a variety of bone conditions, including osteoporosis. Modulation of Arginase I expression can also provide an effective treatment for osteoporosis by reducing chronic inflammation in the bone, which can be an aggravating factor in osteoporosis. Methods of Treating Immune Disorders, Bone Conditions, and Cancers. The methods, compositions, and kits of this disclosure may comprise a method to treat, arrest, reverse, or ammeliorate a disease. In some cases, the disease may be an autoimmune disease. In some cases, the disease may be a bone condition, such as osteoporosis. In some cases, the modulation is achieved by administrating a therapeutically-effective dose of a recombinant Arginase protein or a functional fragment thereof. In some cases, the protein is recombinant human Arginase I or a functional fragment thereof. Arginase I is an important modulator of the innate and adaptive immune responses. A plurality of subjects afflicted with immune system disorders and cancers can benefit from the use of a recombinant human Arginase I. Subjects can be humans, non-human primates such as chimpanzees, and other apes and monkey species; farm animals such as cattle, horses, sheep, goats, swine; domestic animals such as rabbits, dogs, and cats; laboratory animals including rodents, such as rats, mice and guinea pigs, and the like. A subject can be of any age. Subjects can be, for example, elderly adults, adults, adolescents, pre-adolescents, children, toddlers, infants. Also recognized herein is the therapeutic potential of a recombinant Arginase protein in treating various bone conditions, such as osteoporosis or inflammation in the bones. The strength and integrity of the vertebrate skeleton, e.g., the human skeleton, depends on a delicate equilibrium between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts. In osteoporosis, this balance shifts in favor of osteoclasts, and bone resorption exceeds bone formation. In some cases, a recombinant Arginase protein, or fragment thereof, can shift the balance between osteoclast and osteoblast formation. The activity of a plurality of cells in the immune system can be modulated by a recombinant Arginase I. Non-limiting examples of cells whose activity can be modulated by recombinant Arginase I include: B cells; CD4; CD8; blood cells, including red blood cells and white blood cells; dendritic cells, including dendritic antigen presenting cells; macrophages; memory B cells; memory T cells; monocytes; natural killer cells; neutrophil granulocytes; T-helper cells; and T-killer cells. The activity of a plurality of additional cells can also be modulated by a recombinant Arginase I. Non-limiting examples of cells whose activity can be modulated by recombinant arginase I include hematopoietic stem cells, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, osteoprogenitor, osteocytes, and precursors or derivatives thereof.

Sustained expression of Arginase I proteins can be used clinically to provide a hypo-inflammatory environment in vitro and in vivo (Further described, for instance, in Example 1, and FIGS. 1-6). However, one challenge encountered in formulating a purified Arginase for therapeutic purposes is the formation of protein aggregates in solution due to inter-chain disulfide bond formation. To overcome some of the challenges in preparing a purified Arginase that is suitable for clinical administration, a series of mutations were performed in the sequence of a wild-type human Arginase I. TABLE 1 describes various site-specific mutants of human Arginase I that have been designed to reduce the aggregation of a purified recombinant Arginase I in solution. TABLE 1 also describes various human Arginase I sequences comprising a molecular tag (SEQ ID NO: 9-16).

Pegylated Recombinant Arginases. An Arginase, or a functional fragment thereof, can be modified with one or more polyethylene glycol molecule(s) (PEGs). The covalent attachment of a PEG(s) oligomer to a drug or therapeutic protein can reduce the immunogenicity and antigenicity of the recombinant Arginase I from the subject's immune system. The covalent attachment of a PEG(s) oligomer to a drug or therapeutic protein can increase the hydrodynamic size of the recombinant Arginase, which can prolong the half-life of a pegylated recombinant human Arginase I in solution. PEG oligomers for use in the present invention can be, for example, (CH2CH2O) or (CH2CH2O)CH2CH2, but can also include polyalkylene glycols including, but not limited to polypropylene- or polybutylene glycols, methoxy poly(ethylene glycol), or methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) propionic acid (mPEG-acid) where n can be from about 1 to about 400. An Arginase, or a functional fragment thereof, can be modified with various types of PEG molecules. In some embodiments, a PEG oligomer is methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) succinimidyl proprionate (mPEG-SPA). In some embodiments, a PEG oligomer is a methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) propionic acid (mPEG-acid). In some cases, the disclosure provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising, a purified recombinant human Arginase I protein and at least one polyethylene glycol oligomer. In some cases, the pegylated recombinant human Arginase I protein comprises at least two polyethylene glycol oligomers. In some cases the polyethylene glycol oligomer weighs from about 20 kilodaltons to about 40 kilodaltons. In some cases the pegylated recombinant human Arginase I protein comprises from about 4 polyethylene glycol molecules to about 13 polyethylene glycol oligomer. In some cases the polyethylene glycol oligomer weighs about 5 kilodaltons. The covalent attachment of an Arginase, or a functional fragment thereof, to a polymer polyethylene glycol of interest can change the physicochemical characteristics of the Arginase. Examples of physicochemical characteristics that can be altered by binding to a PEG include immunogenicity, in vitro and in vivo biological activity, absorption rate and bioavailability, biodistribuition, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic profiles (PD), and toxicity. In some embodiments, a pegylated Arginase has a reduced immunogenicity. NH2, COOH, OH, SH, and disulfide bonds are examples of chemical groups in the amino acid side chain of an Arginase that could react with a PEG oligomer. The amine in the N-terminus and the carboxyl group in the C-terminus can also react with a PEG oligomer. PEG reagents for protein pegylation can be activated PEGs. Activated PEGs can be used for amine pegylation, thiol pegylation, or N-terminal pegylation. PEG reagents are commercially available in different lengths, shapes and chemistry allowing them to react with particular functional groups of proteins for their covalent attachment.

For example, a PEG oligomer could be attached to a terminus of the amino acid sequence of the recombinant Arginase, or could be attached to a side chain, such as the side chain of a lysine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, aspartic acid, or glutamic acid residue. The attachment can be via an amide bond, an ester bond, an ether bond, a carbamate bond, or a thioether bond. In some cases a polyethylene glycol molecule(s) is conjugated to a cysteine residue of a purified recombinant human Arginase I. In some cases a polyethylene glycol molecule is conjugated to an amine residue of a purified recombinant human Arginase I protein.

Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Measurements. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data can be obtained by various experimental techniques. Appropriate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile components describing a particular composition can vary due to variations in drug metabolism in different subjects. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles can be based on the determination of the mean parameters of a group of subjects. The group of subjects includes any reasonable number of subjects suitable for determining a representative mean, for example, 5 subjects, 10 subjects, 15 subjects, 20 subjects, 25 subjects, 30 subjects, 35 subjects, or more. The mean is determined by calculating the average of all subject's measurements for each parameter measured. A dose can be modulated to achieve a desired pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics profile, such as a desired or effective blood profile, as described herein. To better characterize the enzyme kinetics of recombinant human Arginase I in vitro the Km, Vmax, Kcat, and Kcat/Km of five different recombinant Arginases were measured. The summary of the enzyme kinetics study for five human recombinant Arginases is shown in TABLE 2.

Example 1 Modulating the Immune System with Recombinant Arginase I. The following experiments were conducted to characterize the function of a purified Arginase in the modulation of an immune condition, such as a condition associated with an inflammation. Materials and Methods. Mice: floxed PTEN mice are described by Tak W. Mak (Suzuki, A. et al. 2001. T cell-specific loss of Pten leads to defects in central and peripheral tolerance. Immunity 14: 523-534). LysM cre mice were originally described by Clausen et al. (Clausen, B. E. et al. Transgenic Res. 8: 265-277). Littermate-controlled experiments were performed with 8-12-week-old wildtype, floxed PTEN cre positive and cre negative mice on a C57B1/6 background, which were backcrossed for at least 10 generations. DBA mice were used in the collagen induced arthritis experiments. All animals were bred and housed in a SPF facility of the Medical University of Vienna with a 12 h/12 h day/night cycle and constant temperature. Mice of both sexes were used and no gender-specific differences were found. Genotyping: mice were earmarked 3-4 weeks after birth. DNA from lysed (proteinase K lysis buffer) ear tissue was subjected to direct PCR using GoTaq Polymerase (Promegam4). Specific PCRs were performed with following primers: PTEN primer: forward, (SEQ ID NO: 17) 5′-CTCCTCTACTCCATTCTTCCC-3′, reverse, (SEQ ID NO: 18) 5′-ACTCCCACCAATGAACAAAC-3′; cre primer: forward, (SEQ ID NO: 19) 5′-TCGCGATTATCTTCTATATCTTCAG-3′, reverse, (SEQ ID NO: 20) 5′-GCTCGACCAGTTTAGTTACCC-3′. Preparation and cultivation of primary macrophages: thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were generated by injection of 2 ml 4% thioglycollate (Sigma™) into the peritoneal cavity followed by peritoneal lavage with empty medium 3 days later. Isolated macrophages were seeded at a concentration of 1×106 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen™) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone, 1% L-glutamine, and cultured at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were allowed to recover overnight and in-vitro stimulations were carried out by supplementing the macrophage culture with following agents and cytokines: 100 ng/ml ultrapure E.coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Invivogen™), 100 nM wortmannin (Sigma™), 10 or 200 μM N-hydroxy-L-arginine (Calbiochem™) or 5 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-4/IL-13 (R&D Systems™). Stimulations were carried out for 3, 8 or 24 hrs for RNA extraction, ABCD assay or protein isolation and cytokine measurement, respectively. Preparation and cultivation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC): bone marrow cells were flushed from femurs and tibias of indicated mice and cultivated in complete RPMI medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml recombinant mouse GM-CSF (R&D Systems™) at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Half of the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF at day 3 and day 6 after isolation. Dendritic cells (DC) were harvested and activated at day 7 and the maturation status was determined by flow cytometry using fluorescent conjugated antibodies against CD80 (PE-Cy5™) and MHC-II (PerCP-eFluor 710™) (eBioscience™). Samples were incubated with the antibody-mix for 15 min at 4° C. and subsequently acquired on a LSRII Flow Cytometer (Beckton Dickinson™). Data were analyzed using FlowJo™ Software 10.0 (Treestar™) software. Immunoblotting: cells were homogenized and lysed in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Thermo Scientific Pierce™) after electrophoresis. Proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF™, Millipore™) and, after blocking with 5% dry milk/0.1% Tween 20, incubated overnight with primary antibody. Following antibodies were used: chicken anti-Arginase 1 (kindly provided by Dr. Morris), rabbit antibodies against iNOS (NEB™), PTEN, STATE, pSTAT6 (Cell Signaling Technology™), C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz Biotech) or β-Actin (Sigma™). After incubation for 2 hrs at room temperature (RT) with the respective peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and following development with SuperSignal West Femto (Pierce™), signals were detected using chemiluminescence (FluorChem HD2 chemiluminescence imager, Alpha Innotech™). Bands were analyzed according to their molecular weight. Avidin-biotin complex DNA (ABCD) assay: cells were lysed with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 10% Glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, protease-inhibitor), sonicated (6 impulses for 2 seconds), centrifuged and supernatants were incubated with buffer H (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 20% Glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% NP-40), 2.μg 5′-biotinylated oligo and 20.μg herring sperm DNA for 5 min at 37° C. followed by incubation on ice for 1 h. For the competitor control (comp) a 10-fold excess of non-biotinylated oligo was added. The negative control (nc) contained cell lysate, herring sperm DNA and buffer H. Buffer H equilibrated streptavidin-agarose beads (Novagen™) were added to pull-downs and controls and then incubated for 30 min at 4° C. on a rotator. The beads were centrifuged, washed several times with buffer H, boiled in Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. C/EBPIβ was detected by Western blot (Santa Cruz Biotech™). 5′-biotinylated and non-biotinylated oligos were ordered from MicroSynth: C/EBPβ_for: TAT TAG CCA ATA TTA GCC AAT ATT AGC CAA TAT TAG CCA (SEQ ID NO: 21), C/EBPβ_rev: TGG CTA ATA TTG GCT AAT ATT GGC TAA TAT TGG CTA ATA (SEQ ID NO: 22). Total RNA isolation, reverse transcription and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR): Cells were homogenized and isolated with Trifast Reagent (PEQLAB Biotechnology GmbH™) following the manufacturer's instruction. cDNAs were transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Fermentas™) as indicated in the instruction manual. Expression of mRNA was quantified by real time PCR using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems™) with the StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems™) and primers in TABLE 3. Samples were assayed in duplicates dependent on the quality of their melting curves. Levels of target genes were normalized to HPRT or GAPDH and described as fold induction of unstimulated cells.

IL-6 and IL-12/23 were analyzed in the supernatants of macrophages 24 h after stimulation with LPS. IL-2, IFN-γ and IL-17A were measured in supernatants collected at day 4 of allogeneic mixed leucocyte reactions and of re-stimulated splenocytes and lymphocytes of Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)—immunized mice. Briefly, plates were coated with capture antibody, blocked, and diluted samples and standards were loaded for overnight incubation. Next, plates were incubated with detection antibody and then with Streptavidin-HRP (R&D Systems™) for development TMB 2—Component Microwell Peroxidase. Induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and ex-vivo restimulation: Mice were assigned to 4 groups each consisting of 4 to 8 mice (see study design in TABLE 4). Briefly, for immunization mice were injected with 150 μl of an emulsion containing equal parts of MOG35-55 (1 mg/ml, Charite Berlin™) and IFA (Sigma™) supplemented with 10 mg/ml Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (Difco™). At time of immunization and second day after immunization 200 ng Pertussis toxin (Calbiochem™) were administered by the intraperitoneal route. For in vivo administration of purified recombinant human Arginase I mice were intravenously injected with either 10 mg/kg of body weight at days −4 and −2 prior immunization, or with 10 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg of body weight at days −4, −2 pre-, and 5 and 7 post-immunization. Mice were observed daily for clinical signs. Progression of EAE was divided in 4 clinical stages: grade 0: no signs, grade 1: complete floppy tail, grade 2: severe paraparesis, grade 3: tetraparesis, grade 4: moribund condition. For ex vivo stimulation lymphocytes and splenocytes were isolated and stimulated with 30 μg/ml of the cognate MOG-peptide for 3 days for proliferation analysis and cytokine measurements. Mixed leucocyte reaction (MLR): Wildtype DCs were generated as described. One part of the cells was stimulated with 30 μg/ml purified recombinant human Arginase I (SEQ ID NO: 9) for 24 hrs at day 6 of differentiation, the other part acted as unstimulated control. MLR was performed on day 7 of differentiation in absence of purified recombinant human Arginase I (SEQ ID NO: 9), which was removed by accurate washing. Briefly all cells were activated and loaded with LPS (100 ng/ml, Invitrogen™) and Ovalbumin (50 μg/ml, Sigma™) for 4 hours, washed and co-cultivated with OT-II cells. Responder T cells were isolated from spleens of OT-II mice via positive magnetic cell sorting using a pan T-cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec™), labeled with 7 μM CFSE/1×107 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma™). DCs (100 000 cells) were washed and plated on a 48-well along with responder T-cells (500 000 cells) in 500 μl total volume. On day 3 of the co-culture cells were harvested, fixed and subjected to intracellular staining. For proliferation cells were harvested in TruCount tubes and analyzed for CFSE dilution. CD4* T cell phenotyping by flow cytometry: Cells were isolated from MLR in vitro cultures on day 3 and re-stimulated with PMA/ionomycin (Sigma™) together with Golgi-Stop (BD Biosciences™) and analyzed for intracellular cytokines. The following antibodies were used for cytokine staining: Anti-mouse CD4-PerCP (clone RM4-5, BD Pharmingen™), CD25-PE-Cy7 (clone PC61.5), IL-2-eFlour® 450 (clone JES6-5H4), IL-10- Alexa Flour® 647 (clone JESS-16E3), IL-17A-PE-Cy7 (clone 17B7), IFNγ-PE (clone XMG1.2, all from eBioscience™). Cell acquisition and data analysis was performed on a LSR 2 flow cytometer (BD BiosciencesTm) and FlowJo™ software Version 10.0 (Treestar™). Statistics: Statistical significance of data was calculated by use of an unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test. Two way ANOVA analyses were used to analyze two groups over time. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad™ Software, La Jolla, USA). Results are presented as the mean +/− standard deviation. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant (p-values were expressed as follows: * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001). Results. To better characterize the biological crosstalk between Arginase I expression and the activation of immune cells the expression profile of Arginase I mRNA under different conditions was investigated. We identified increased levels of Arginase I mRNA in a genome wide screen of PTEN deficient dendritic cells and littermate derived control cells. FIG. 1 illustrates the upregulation of Arginase I by LPS in macrophages. In FIG. 1, Thioglycollate elicited peritoneal macrophages (tPMs) were induced by E. coli 0111:B4 LPS for 8 h and 24 h. Arginase I expression was increased on mRNA level 8 hours after LPS stimulation (FIG. 1, Panel A) and on protein level within 24 hours post LPS induction (FIG. 1, Panel B). These time points were selected for further analysis of LPS-mediated Arginase I expression in dependence of the PI3K/PTEN signaling pathway in macrophages. High expression of Arginase I in PTEN deficient macrophages suggested that one or more components of the signal transduction pathways involved in innate immunity could regulate, or be regulated, by Arginase I expression. FIG. 2 illustrates an increase in Arginase I expression accompanied by loss of PTEN. FIG. 2, panel A illustrates the marked upregulation of Arginase I mRNA in unstimulated, nave PTEN deficient peritoneal macrophages. These experiments were performed in resident peritoneal macrophages and in sterile inflammation induced peritoneal macrophages (FIG. 2, panels B and C). In accordance with upregulated Arginase I mRNA expression, increased mRNA levels for stabilin 1 in unstimulated PTEN−/− tPMs (FIG. 2, panel D), and reduced expression of YM1 and FIZZ (FIG. 2, panels E and F) was observed. The increase in protein expression of Arginase I in PTEN negative cells was also confirmed. To further evaluate the function of Arginase I in response to LPS induced signaling events the expression levels of Arginase I on mRNA and protein levels was analyzed 24 hours post LPS activation (FIG. 2, panels H and I). Wildtype macrophages harvested from littermate control mice showed slight upregulation of Arginase I. Notably the expression of the prominent M1 marker iNOS was also enhanced in LPS stimulated PTEN deficient macrophages. The following experients were conducted to further study the mechanisms of a broader immune-regulatory function of Arginase I in immune cells: 1) wildtype macrophages were stimulated with LPS; 2) stimulation was inhibited with the fungal PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, which has been reported to enhance cytokine synthesis upon LPS induction in vitro and in vivo (Guha, M., and N. Mackman. 2002. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway limits lipopolysaccharide activation of signaling pathways and expression of inflammatory mediators in human monocytic cells. J. Biol. Chem. 277: 32124-32132); Schabbauer, G. et al. 2004. PI3K-Akt pathway suppresses coagulation and inflammation in endotoxemic mice. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 24: 1963-1969); and with 3) the Arginase inhibitor N-hydroxy-nor- L-arginine (L-nor-Arg). Inhibition of Arginase I significantly enhanced IL-6 production in macrophages (FIG. 2, panel J). The effects of the Arginase-specific inhibitor on the diminished cytokine production of PTEN-/- macrophages was also evaluated as compared to wildtype macrophages. Indeed a significant, but only partial, restoration of the wildtype IL-6 production was found upon treatment with L-nor-Arg in PTEN deficient tPMs (FIG. 2, panel K). The pharmacologic Arginase inhibition and the ablation of the anti-inflammatory phenotype in PTEN deficient Arginase overexpres sing tPMs support the claim that Arginase I contributes to the PI3K mediated modulation of inflammatory responses. PTEN deletion in macrophages upregulates the transcription factor C/EBPI3, which is crucial for Arginase I promoter activation. To elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for the PTEN-mediated gene regulation of Arginase I, several potential candidate transcription factors (TF) were analyzed. The most prominent regulator of Arginase I is STAT 6, which is activated by IL-4 and/or IL-13 in macrophages (Gordon, S., and F. O. Martinez. 2010. Alternative activation of macrophages: mechanism and functions. Immunity 32: 593-604). Unstimulated tPMs, either PTEN deficient cells or wild type cells derived from littermate control animals, did not show any overt changes in STAT6 total protein content or activated STAT6 as measured by phospho-specific STAT6 antibodies. Another candidate transcription factor is C/EBPβ, which has been shown to contribute to pattern recognition receptor-mediated regulation of Arginase I (El Kasmi, K. C. et al. 2008. Toll-like receptor-induced arginase 1 in macrophages thwarts effective immunity against intracellular pathogens. Nat. Immunol. 9: 1399-1406). To characterize mechanisms of modulating Arginase I expression by modulating upstream factors, the regulation of C/EBPI3 by PTEN, and subsequent constitutive upregulation of Arginase I by C/EBPβ were analyzed. FIG. 3 illustrates the function of C/EBPβ in PTEN deficient macrophages. FIG. 3, panel A illustrates the upregulation of C/EBPβ protein in PTEN deficient tPMs. FIG. 3, panel B illustrates that the same result was obtained for two isoforms of C/EBPβ, LAP and LAP*. Further induction of the transcription factor was observed within 8 hours post LPS induction. However we could not identify an additional upregulation of C/EBPβ by PTEN deletion upon TLR4 activation at least at the time point we have evaluated (8 h). Since maximal Arginase I expression is observed 24 h after LPS induction, we cannot exclude C/EBPβ differential expression might occur earlier in activated PTEN deficient macrophages. Due to the fact that C/EBPβ is a transcription factor acting on specific DNA elements, the binding of C/EBPβ to the Arginase enhancer element containing a number of different TF consensus binding sites was investigated. An avidin biotin coupled DNA (ABCD) binding assay was used to evaluate C/EBPβ DNA binding properties using biotinylated oligos spanning the C/EBPβ consensus site within the Arginase enhancer 3.8 kb upstream of the transcription start site. The suitability of this experimental system was tested in HEK cells overexpres sing C/EBPβ. Overexpressed C/EBPβ efficiently bound the oligo which could be precipitated together with the transcription factor, in particular the LAP* isoform, bound to it. Next the effects of PTEN deficiency on C/EBPβ DNA binding in macrophages was analyzed. First the presence of C/EBPβ in the lysates used for the ABCD binding assays was verified. Equal input for the ABCD assay was determined by reproving against GAPDH (FIG. 3, panel C). Analysis of TF binding to the Arginase oligo suggests that in addition to increased protein levels enhanced binding of C/EBPβ occurred. LAP* was identified as the dominant isoform binding to the Arginase enhancer oligo (FIG. 3, panel D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for PI3K/PTEN regulation of Arginase I expression via C/EBPβ. Example 2 Extracellular Activity of Arginase I. To study the cellular site of action of Arginase I, supernatants (SN) of peritoneal macrophages were analyzed. Unexpectedly, Arginase I was released into the extracellular space. This is in contrast to Arginase I counterpart iNOS. To further evaluate the role of Arginase I in cytokine production and the potential of antigen presenting cells to polarize T-cells, media conditioned to wildtype bone marrow derived GM-CSF differentiated dendritic cells was transferred and their inflammatory response to LPS was analyzed. FIG. 4 illustrates that constitutive activation of PI3K promotes Arginase I expression and release into the extracellular space. Surprisingly, the data indicates a downregulation in the protein levels of the T-cell polarizing cytokines IL-6 and IL-12 p40, the common subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 (further on denoted as IL-12/23), (FIG. 4, panel D). Next we attempted to mimic a physiological environment with high expression of Arginase I conditioned media from PTEN deficient macrophages, using purified recombinant human Arginase I (recArgl). In order to do so, dendritic cells stimulated by LPS were pre-incubated with purified recombinant human Arginase I. Reduced expression levels of IL-6 and IL-12/23 similar to the treatment with conditioned media was detected. The decrease in expression was more pronounced on IL-12/23 expression as compared to IL-6 (FIG. 4, panel E). To further characterize the biological crosstalk between Arginase I expression and PTEN expression the expression of Arginase I and IL-4/IL-13 in PTEN deficient cells was measured. Deficiency of PTEN leads to highly increased expression levels of Arginase I, even in unstimulated peritoneal macrophages tPMs (FIG. 4, panel A). These findings were surprising and unexpected. To quantify the results, macrophages derived from 5 wildtype littlermates and PTEN-/- animals were analyzed. A greater than 10-fold increase in extracellular Arginase I expression was detected in PTEN-/- macrophages (FIG. 4, panels B and C). In addition, we evaluated Arginase I secretion in response to LPS and in parallel to combined activation by IL-4 and IL-13. In both cases we observed increased secretion in PTEN deficient macrophages, which was also seen to a limited extent in wildtype cells (FIG. 4, panels B bottom). The result indicates that Arginase I presence in the extracellular environment of macrophages might exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in a paracrine fashion. Example 3 Free Arginase I Potently Inhibits T-cell Polarization. To analyze the effects of recombinant human Arginase I on antigen presentation and T-cell polarizing properties, bone marrow derived GM-CSF differentiated wildtype dendritic cells were pre-conditioned with recombinant Arginase I overnight before the cells were loaded with Ovalbumin (Ova) and stimulated with LPS. To avoid potential effects on T-cells, recArgl was removed from the DCs by multiple washing steps before cultivating them together with isolated OT-II T-cells in a ratio 5:1. Treatment of dendritic cells with recombinant Arginase I in a concentration of 30 μg/ml did not alter the surface expression of prototypic DC activation markers CD80 and MHCII, as measured by flow cytometry. The results of the MLR were evaluated after 3 days of co-culture of DCs and T-cells. FIG. 5 illustrates inhibition of T-cell polarization by Arginase I. We observed a significant reduction of Th1 and Th17 signature cytokines IFNγ (FIG. 5, panels A and B) and IL17A (FIG. 5, panels D and E) expressing CD4+T-cells. We note that IL-17 producing cells were present, but in low numbers. Analyzes of T-cell cytokines that were secreted during the MLR after LPS/Ova priming reveal significant differences in the release of IFNγ, whereas IL-17A was not significantly different (FIG. 5, panels C and F). Proliferation as measured by CFSE dilution in dividing T-cells was evaluated. However we did not find significant changes in the presence of recombinant Arginase I (FIG. 5, panels G and H). The data suggests that extracellular Arginase I in the presence of antigen-presenting cells ameliorates T-cell priming, thereby reducing the capacity to polarize preferentially in Th1 cells. To further corroborate this hypothesis, the ability of recombinant Arginase I to inhibit T cell polarization in vivo in a clinically relevant model for T-cell mediated autoimmune disease was characterized. Example 4 Recombinant Arginase I in the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis. Autoimmune diseases are characterized by a deregulated immune system. The experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model is an art recognized animal model of multiple sclerosis. To study the ability of a recombinant Arginase I to module an immune response, the response of a mouse model for multiple sclerosis treated with a purified Arginase was characterized. The EAE mouse reflects some, but not all, features of the human autoimmune pathology (Lassmann, H., and H. J. van. 2011. The molecular basis of neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis. FEBS Lett. 585: 3715-3723). EAE was induced in wildtype mice by immunization with MOG35-55 peptide in CFA (Lassmann, H., and H. J. van. 2011. The molecular basis of neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis. FEBS Lett. 585: 3715-3723). In addition pertussis toxin was administered. The potential efficacy of recombinant Arginase I in ameliorating disease progression was characterized as follows: to determine a time-frame of treatment, while antigen presentation and T-cell polarization were still ongoing, Arginase was administered in two different concentrations before and shortly after immunization as described in TABLE 4. TABLE 4 days (pre- or post-immunization) −4 −2 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Control: No treatment Group 1: + + + + recArgI 10 mg/kg Group 2: + + + + recArgI 1 mg/kg Group 3: + + recArgI pre 10 mg/kg FIG. 6 illustrates results of a treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with recombinant human Arginase I. The control group developed visible signs of EAE after 12 days, further increasing until day 17. Pretreatment with recombinant Arginase I (10 mg/kg) did not have any effect on the course of disease (FIG. 6, panel C). Pre- and post-treatment with recombinant Arginase I (10 mg/kg) in contrast was characterized by a significant reduction in the onset as well as the magnitude of the disease (FIG. 6, panel A). In the same experimental setup, a minimum therapeutically effective dose of a pegylated Arginase I (SEQ ID NO: 9) was tested (1 mg/kg). Treatment delayed the onset of disease, but disease progression and severity was not significantly inhibited by the treatment with the lower dose of the pegylated Arginase I (FIG. 6, panel B). To analyze the MOG-specific T-cell response on a molecular level we harvested spleens and the draining lymph node (inguinal) and restimulated the splenocytes and the lymph node cells, derived from recombinant human Arginase-treated and control EAE mice, in vitro with the MOG35-55 peptide. Restimulation of cells without further activation by exogenous stimuli led to a marked increase in IFNγ and IL-17A secretion into the supernatants (see control vs. control+MOG in FIG. 6, panels D-G). Interestingly we found highly significant differences for reduced IFNγ (FIG. 6, panels D and E) and IL-17A (FIG. 6, panels F and G) levels in both pre- and post-treatment groups (1 mg/kg as well as 10 mg/kg recombinant Arginase I) in particular in the draining lymph node. These data suggest that recombinant Arginase I treatment in the phase of antigen presentation at least at the higher concentration efficiently blunts EAE pathology in mice through a diminished capacity of CD4+T cells to produce cytokines IFNγ and IL-17A indispensable for the development of EAE. Example 5 Recombinant Arginase I in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Arthritis is an autoimmune condition associated with varied levels of pain, swelling, joint stiffness and sometimes a constant ache around the joint(s). There are over 100 different forms of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and related autoimmune diseases. Septic arthritis is caused by joint infection. The major complaint by individuals who have arthritis is joint pain. Pain is often a constant and may be localized to the joint affected. The pain from arthritis is due to inflammation that occurs around the joint, damage to the joint from disease, daily wear and tear of joint, muscle strains caused by inflammation. To evaluate the role of a recombinant human Arginase I in the treatment of arthritis we measured several clinical parameters of arthritic mice treated with the recombinant protein. FIG. 7 depicts graphs measuring various clinical parameters of arthritic mice treated with recombinant human Arginase I. FIG. 7, panel A illustrates the percentage variation in weigh of mice receiving either saline, 1 mg/kg/w or 10 mg/kg/w of recombinant human Arginase I. FIG. 7, panel B is a graph plotting the cc-collagen type II antibody titer (arbitrary units) of mice receiving the treatments previously described. FIG. 7, panels C and D are the measurements of two different clinical parameters of the same mice described above, namely, paw swelling and grip strength. The results suggest that weekly treatment of arthritic mice with recombinant human Arginase I ameliorate the disease but do not prevent disease progression. FIG. 8 is a photograph illustrating the reduction of paw swelling in arthritic mice with human recombinant human Arginase I. FIG. 8, panel A illustrates the swelling of an arthritic mice that received treatment with saline only. FIG. 8, panel B illustrates the swelling of an arthritic mice that received treatment with 10 mg/kg of pegylated human recombinant Arginase I. The statistical quantitation of the data suggests that treatment of arthritic mice with both 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of recombinant human Arginase I reduces paw swelling, as measured by the decrease in wrist joint diameter. FIG. 9 corresponds to graphs illustrating the quantitation of different cytokines in arthritic mice. The animals in FIGS. 9 and 10 were treated with collagen immunization, which promoted arthritis in the mice. FIG. 9 panels A and B indicate that only a modest decrease in the levels of IL17A and IL12/23 is observed in the mice treated with recombinant human Arginase I. FIG. 9 panel C illustrates the reduction of systemic release of the inflammatory cytokine Interleukin 6 (IL-6) in arthritic mice treated with a recombinant human Arginase I. FIG. 10 panels A-C indicate that the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are not changed in collagen induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA mice. As a comparison to the arthritis treatment, FIG. 11 illustrates the clinical score of a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) treated with human recombinant human Arginase I (for further details, see Example 1). The results indicate that a purified recombinant human Arginase I can effectively treat conditions of the immune system. To test the effects of recombinant Arginase in an in vivo setting involving antigen presentation, cytokine release and T-cell polarization, fluorescent-activated cell sorting experiments were used to characterize populations of immune cells in EAE mice. Arginase treatment was performed after the disease progressed to a phenotype of partial hind limb paralysis and indicated that treatment with at least the recombinant arginase of SEQ ID NO. 9 could promote faster recovery. FIG. 12 depicts the fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of populations of immune cells in EAE mice treated with recombinant human Arginase I (FIG. 12, PANELS A-D). FIG. 13 depicts the results of fluorescence-activated cell sorting experiments indicating that treatment with recombinant human Arginase I prevents T-cell proliferation (FIG. 13, PANELS A-F). Example 6 Pegylated Formulations of Recombinant Human Arginase I. In vitro and in vivo experiments point out the immune-modulatory properties of extracellular Arginase I. To formulate, evaluate, and optimize pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of recombinant human Arginase I in vivo several experiments characterizing the pegylation of recombinant Arginase I were conducted. Pegylation is the process of covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer chains to another molecule. The covalent attachment of PEG to a drug or therapeutic protein can reduce the immunogenicity and antigenicity of the recombinant Arginase I from the subject's immune system, and increase the hydrodynamic size of the recombinant Arginase, which can prolong the half-life of a pegylated recombinant human Arginase I in vivo. FIG. 14 is a schematic of a process utilized for optimizing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a recombinant human Arginase I. Three different methods of covalent attachment of different sizes of PEG molecules to recombinant Arginase I molecules were tested. For illustrative purposes, FIG. 14 describes the attachment of distinct PEG molecules to SEQ ID NO: 1 by distinct methods, but it should be understood that the pegylation optimization strategy applies to any one of SEQ ID NOS. 1-16. FIG. 14 illustrates three methods of covalently attaching a PEG polymer chains to, for example SEQ ID No. 1, namely amine —NH2 conjugation, cysteine (SH) conjugation, and N-terminal modification. The pegylation of various mutant recombinant human Arginases at specific residues was optimized as described in FIG. 14. TABLE 5 summarizes the pegylation of various mutant recombinant human Arginases by cysteine (—SH) conjugation. FIG. 15 shows the levels of serum Arginine depletion in Spragus Dawley rats obtained with the pegylated Arginases described in TABLE 5 with a single intravenous dose of 3 mg/kg. TABLE 5 SEQ ID NO.

The pharmacokinetic data in rats indicates that pegylation of recombinant human Arginase I at multiple sites with low molecular weight PEGs, such as methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) succinimidyl proprionate (mPEG-SPA) can provide effective arginine depletion in vivo.

Example 7 Recombinant Arginase I in the Treatment of Human Autoimmune Conditions. As disclosed in previous examples, Arginase I functions as an immunemodulating protein on intra- and extra- cellular levels. Pharmacological interference with arginase mediated L-arginine depletion can effectively ameliorate swelling, pain, and joint stiffness in art recognized models of Multiple Sclerosis and Rheumatoid Arthritis (Examples 4 and 5). Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized as a chronic, inflammatory disease in which the immune system destroys synovial joints and accessory structures. Due to the progressive nature of RA, this autoimmune condition can cause extra-articular complications within several organ systems. Administration of a recombinant Arginase I of the disclosure can be used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in a human. Any one of the recombinant human Arginases disclosed in SEQ ID NOS: 1 through 16 can be used for the treatment of an autoimmune condition in a human, such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis. The purified Arginase can be pegylated. In some embodiments, the purified Arginase is pegylated via amine conjugation with a methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) succinimidyl proprionate (mPEG-SPA) oligomer that weighs about 5 kDa (Example 6). In other embodiments, the purified Arginase can by pegylated with any other suitable PEG oligomer. Pegylation of the purified Arginase(s) can provide a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of RA that has low immunogenicity, for instance, the pegylation of recombinant human Arginase I at multiple sites with low molecular weight PEGs, such as (5 kDa mPEG-SPA oligomers) effectively reduced the exposure of epitopes resulting in an effective treatment with low immunogenecity. Various PEG oligomers disclosed herein can be used to effectively reduce the exposure of epitopes of an Arginase of the disclosure. Example 8 Recombinant Arginase I in Organ Transplantation. Immune suppression dampens an abnormal immune response in autoimmune diseases but it can also reduce a normal immune response to prevent rejection of transplanted organs or cells. Immunomodulator drugs are important in the management of organ transplantation. Any one of the recombinant human Arginases disclosed in SEQ ID NOs: 1-16 can be used as an immnomodulator in the management of organ transplantation. In some embodiments, the recombinant Arginase is pegylated. In some embodiments, the recombinant Arginase is pegylated via amine conjugation with a methoxy poly(ehtylene glycol) succinimidyl proprionate (mPEG-SPA) oligomer that weighs about 5 kDa. In other embodiments, the purified Arginase can by pegylated with any other suitable PEG oligomer. Pegylation of the recombinant Arginase can provide a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of RA that has low immunogenicity: the pegylation of recombinant human Arginase I at multiple sites with low molecular weight PEGs, such as (5 kDa mPEG-SPA oligomers) can effectively reduce the exposure of epitopes resulting in the reduction of immunogenecity. Various PEG oligomers disclosed herein can be used to effectively reduce the exposure of epitopes of an Arginase of the disclosure. Example 9 Treatment of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) with Recombinant Human Arginase I. The experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse is an art recognized model of multiple sclerosis. EAE is also widely used as an animal model for T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. To investigate the effectiveness of treating an inflammatory disease in a subject with a therapeutically-effective amount of a recombinant Arginase, the effectiveness of a pegylated recombinant human Arginase I, SEQ ID NO: 9, in modulating the mRNA and protein expression of Interferon gamma and IL-17A in stimulated T-cells was investigated (treatment protocol and T-cell isolation was as described in Example 1). FIG. 19 illustrates IFNγ and IL-17A mRNA expression levels from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) restimulated Tcells inhibited with purified human Arginase I. FIG. 20 illustrates IFNγ and IL-17A protein expression levels from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) restimulated Tcells inhibited with purified human Arginase I. FIGS. 19 and 20 illustrate a significant reduction in mRNA and protein levels of IFNγ and IL-17A in MOG stimulated Tcells. FIG. 21 illustrates improvements in clinical scores of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice treated with recombinant human Arginase I. In this experiment, antigen-presenting cells were treated with pegylated recombinant human Arginase I, SEQ ID NO: 9, ex vivo and transplanted back into EAE mice. FIG. 21, Panel A, illustrates the clinical score of EAE mice that were not challenged with CFA and pertussis prior to receiving ex vivo stimulated antigen presenting cells. FIG. 21, Panel A, illustrates a delayed improvement in the clinical score of the mice that had not been challenged with CFA and pertussis. FIG. 21, Panel B, illustrates the clinical score of EAE mice that were challenged with CFA and pertussis prior to receiving ex vivo stimulated antigen presenting cells. FIG. 21, Panel B, illustrates a more rapid clinical score improvement. Example 10 Modulation of Osteoclast Differentiation with Recombinant Human Arginase I. In healthy bone, bone formation and bone resorption are processes involved in the normal remodeling of bone. In the process of remodeling, cells called osteoclasts resorb bone tissues whereas cells called osteoblasts deposit new bone tissue. Osteoclasts are important in the remodeling, maintenance, and repair of bones of the vertebral skeleton. For instance, osteoclast dysfunction has been associated with osteoporosis. An osteoclast differentiation assay was employed to assess the ability of the recombinant human Arginase disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 9 to modulate osteoclast differentiation. FIG. 22 is an schematic of an osteoclast differentiation assay. On day 0 of the differentiation assay, bone marrow cells were isolated from male mice with standard techniques, i.e., bone marrow cells were flushed with PBS from the fibia, plated in 10 cm tissue culture dishes and treated with 100 ng/ml of M-CSF. After 3 days of differentiation induced by the M-CSF, cells were harvested and plated at a density of 100,000 cells/ml. The plated cells were subsequently treated with 50 ng/ml RANKL and 30 ng/ml M-CSF. At days 7-8 of the differentiation protocol osteoclasts were TRAP-stained and counted. FIG. 23, Panel A is a graph enumerating the number of osteoclasts with at least three nuclei that were counted in an osteoclast differentiation assay. As shown in FIG. 23, Panel A, bone marrow cells were treated with recombinant Arginase I on days 3 and 6 of the differentiation protocol and together with RANKL incubation. FIG. 23, Panel B is a representative microscopy picture illustrating Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining of cells in control dish (untreated) and cells that were treated with 300 ng/ml of the recombinant human Arginase of SEQ ID NOs: 9. The TRAP staining is a marker for osteoclasts. The data is presented as mean ±SEM and n=two mice per group, and corresponds to two independent experiments. Three technical replicates were performed in each independent experiment. * represent p<0.05, *** represent p<0.001. B. The expression levels of endogenous Arginase I mRNA were monitored by qPCR at different time points during the differentiation protocol. FIG. 24 is a graph illustrating the expression levels of Arginase I in control cells on days 3 and 7 of the differentiation protocol as compared to the levels of the housekeeping control gene HPRT. The sequence of the Arginase primers used is disclosed in TABLE 3. FIG. 24 illustrates that expression of Arginase I is lost during osteoclastogenesis. Messenger RNA levels of Arginase I decrease after addition of RANKL on day 3 of osteoclast differentiation. The data of FIG. 24 is presented as mean ±SEM and n=5 mice per group, and are two combined independent experiments. * Represents p<0.05. To assess the ability of recombinant Arginase I to modulate osteoclast differentiation, increasing dosages of the recombinant human Arginase of SEQ ID NOs: 9 were added to different petri dishes on days 3 and day 6 of the differentiation protocol. The experimental protocol used is as follows (a minimum of three different petri dishes received each treatment): a) a control dish was not treated with recombinant human Arginase; b) a first experimental dish was treated with a dose of 1 ng/ml of the recombinant human Arginase on days 3 and day 6 of the differentiation protocol; c) a second experimental dish was treated with a dose of 10 ng/ml of the recombinant human Arginase on days 3 and day 6 of the differentiation protocol; d) a third experimental dish was treated with a dose of 100 ng/ml of the recombinant human Arginase on days 3 and day 6 of the differentiation protocol; e) a fifth experimental dish was treated with a dose of 1,000 ng/ml (1 μg/ml) of the recombinant human Arginase on days 3 and day 6 of the differentiation protocol. FIG. 25 illustrates that addition of recombinant human Arginase I (SEQ ID NO. 9) during days 3 and 6 of osteoclast differentiation can modulate osteoclast formation. FIG. 25, Panel A shows that addition of 1,000 ng/ml of recombinant human Arginase I (SEQ ID NO. 9) inhibited osteoclast formation. FIG. 25, Panel B illustrates representative microscope pictures of the cells treated with the dosages of the recombinant human Arginase I (SEQ ID NO. 9) described in a)-e). A recombinant human Arginase I (SEQ ID NO. 9) can block osteoclastogenesis in a dose dependent manner at concentrations between 100 and 300 ng/ml. FIG. 25, Panel B illustrates that cells incubated with 1,000 ng/ml appear morphologically as TRAP negative macrophages despite of incubation with RANKL. The data in FIG. 25 is presented as mean ±SEM and n=6 mice per group, and are three combined independent experiments, *** represents p<0.001. To assess the direct effects of the recombinant human Arginase I (SEQ ID NO. 9) in modulating osteoclast differentiation, the differentiation protocol described above was performed with the addition of untreated, denatured, and enzymatically inactivated recombinant human Arginase I (SEQ ID NO. 9). The assay assessed the ability of denatured and enzymatically inactivated Arginase I in promoting or inhibiting osteoclast formation. The Arginase I enzyme was either a) heat denatured (70° C. 10 min) or b) enzymatically inactivated with 300 μM of the inhibitor nor-NOHA. The Arginases were then added to separate dishes on day 3 of the differentiation protocol. FIG. 26 illustrates the number of differentiated osteoclasts that could be enumerated in a differentiation assay supplemented with denatured and N(omega)-hydroxy-nor-arginine (nor-NOHA) treated recombinant human Arginase I (SEQ ID NO. 9) as compared to a control, untreated dish. Normal osteoclast counts were observed, which suggests that Arginine availability is a prerequisite for osteoclast formation. The data in FIG. 26 is presented as mean ±SEM and n=2 mice per group, and are representative of one experiment. FIG. 26 demonstrates that blockage of osteoclastogenesis is dependent on the catalytic functions of Arginase I. Osteoclasts are formed by the fusion of many cells derived from circulating monocytes in the blood, which are derived from hematopoietic stem cells. To assess the role of Arginase I in the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, the differentiation protocol described above was performed with the addition of 1 μg/ml of recombinant human Arginase I on day 0. FIG. 27 demonstrates that the addition of a 1 μg/ml dosage of recombinant human Arginase I recombinant Arginase I to hematopoietic stem cells on day 0 of the differentiation protocol does not influence osteoclast formation. The data in FIG. 27 is presented as mean ±SEM and n=4 mice per group. The data shows a combination of two independent experiments. To assess the effects of 10 μg/ml dosages of recombinant human Arginase I in hematopoietic stem cells, the differentiation protocol described above was performed with the addition of 10 μg/ml of recombinant human Arginase I on days 0 and on day 6. FIG. 28 illustrates that addition of a 10 μg/ml dosage of recombinant human Arginase I on hematopoietic stem cells (day 0 of differentiation; “d0”) can interfere with osteoclast formation. In addition, the addition of 1 μg/ml dosage of recombinant human Arginase I on cells that have been differentiated for 6 days (day 6 of differentiation; “d6”) can still interfere with osteoclast formation. The data in FIG. 28 is presented as mean ±SEM and n=2 mice per group, and are representative of one experiment. To assess the effects of different dosages of recombinant human Arginase I in the expression levels of genes involved in osteoclastogenesis, mRNA levels of relevant genes of osteoclastogenesis were measured after 7 days of differentiation (with and without incubation with recombinant human Arginase I). FIG. 29 illustrates the changes in expression levels of the TRAP, RANK, NFAT cl, and c-FOS genes during differentiation with and without recombinant human Arginase I. Messenger RNA levels of RANK, NFATc1 and c-FOS are increased after addition of 100 ng/ml recombinant human Arginase I, indicating a stimulating effect of lower Arginase I concentrations. Addition of 1,000 ng/ml recombinant human Arginase I correlates with a strong downregulation of the TRAP, RANK, NFAT cl, and c-FOS genes genes. The data in FIG. 29 is presented as mean ±SEM and n=4 mice per group, and are two combined independent experiments. Example 11 In-vivo Modulation of Bone Conditions with Recombinant Human Arginase I. A mouse model of osteoporosis was created by removing the ovaries of 10 week-old female mice. The procedure induced artificial menopause and bone loss in the mice and provided an in-vivo model for the study of osteoporosis. Up to 30 mg/kg of the recombinant human Arginases disclosed in SEQ ID NOs: 9 was administered to the mice twice weekly. Mice were sacrificed and evaluated at 4 weeks after the start of treatment. A histological analysis of the tibiae was performed to assess bone volume and destruction. The presence of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in this disease model wereassessed using OsteoMeasure software (OsteoMetrics Inc., Atlanta).
