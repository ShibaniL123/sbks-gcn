DETAILED DESCRIPTION For the purposes of this invention and the claims thereto, the new numbering scheme for the Periodic Table Groups is used as in Chem. Eng. News, 1985, 63, 27. Therefore, a “Group 4 metal” is an element from Group 4 of the Periodic Table. In the structures depicted throughout this specification and the claims, a solid line indicates a bond, an arrow indicates that the bond may be dative, and each dashed line represents a bond having varying degrees of covalency and a varying degree of coordination. The terms “hydrocarbyl radical,” “hydrocarbyl” and “hydrocarbyl group” are used interchangeably throughout this document unless otherwise specified.

In addition two or more such hydrocarbyl radicals may together form a fused ring system, including partially or fully hydrogenated fused ring systems, which may include heterocyclic radicals. For purposes herein, a carbazole or substituted carbazole radical is represented by the formula: wherein each R1 through R8 is, independently, a hydrogen, a C1-C40 hydrocarbyl radical, a functional group comprising elements from Group 13-17 of the periodic table of the elements, or two or more of R1 to R8 may independently join together to form a C4 to C62 cyclic or polycyclic ring structure, or a combination thereof.

Where reference is made herein to two substituents joining together to form a cyclic or polycyclic ring structure, one substituent is directly bridged to another substituent when the two substituents together form only a covalent bond containing no atoms, i.e., the substituents are not directly bridged if they together comprise a bridge of at least one atom. For purposes herein an “olefin,” alternatively referred to as “alkene,” is a linear, branched, or cyclic compound comprising carbon and hydrogen having at least one double bond. For purposes of this specification and the claims appended thereto, when a polymer or copolymer is referred to as comprising an olefin, the olefin present in such polymer or copolymer is the polymerized form of the olefin. For example, when a copolymer is said to have an “ethylene” content of 35 wt % to 55 wt %, it is understood that the mer unit in the copolymer is derived from ethylene in the polymerization reaction and said derived units are present at 35 wt % to 55 wt %, based upon the weight of the copolymer. For purposes herein a “polymer” has two or more of the same or different “mer” units. A “homopolymer” is a polymer having mer units that are the same. A “copolymer” is a polymer having two or more mer units that are different from each other. A “terpolymer” is a polymer having three mer units that are different from each other. “Different” in reference to mer units indicates that the mer units differ from each other by at least one atom or are different isomerically. Accordingly, the definition of copolymer, as used herein, includes terpolymers and the like. An oligomer is typically a polymer having a low molecular weight, such as an Mn of less than 25,000 g/mol, or in an embodiment according to the invention, less than 2,500 g/mol, or a low number of mer units, such as 75 mer units or less. An “ethylene polymer” or “ethylene copolymer” is a polymer or copolymer comprising at least 50 mole % ethylene derived units, a “propylene polymer” or “propylene copolymer” is a polymer or copolymer comprising at least 50 mole % propylene derived units, and so on.

The terms “catalyst”, “catalyst compound”, and “transition metal compound” are defined to mean a compound capable of initiating polymerization catalysis under the appropriate conditions. In the description herein, the catalyst may be described as a catalyst precursor, a pre-catalyst compound, or a transition metal compound, and these terms are used interchangeably. A catalyst compound may be used by itself to initiate catalysis or may be used in combination with an activator to initiate catalysis. When the catalyst compound is combined with an activator to initiate catalysis, the catalyst compound is often referred to as a pre-catalyst or catalyst precursor. A “catalyst system” is combination of at least one catalyst compound, at least one activator, an optional co-activator, and an optional support material, where the system can polymerize monomers to polymer. For the purposes of this invention and the claims thereto, when catalyst systems are described as comprising neutral stable forms of the components it is well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the ionic form of the component is the form that reacts with the monomers to produce polymers. For purposes herein the term “catalyst productivity” is a measure of how many grams of polymer (P) are produced using a polymerization catalyst comprising W grams of catalyst (cat), over a period of time of T hours; and may be expressed by the following formula: P/(T×W) and expressed in units of gPgcat−1hr−1. Conversion is the amount of monomer that is converted to polymer product, and is reported as mol % and is calculated based on the polymer yield and the amount of monomer fed into the reactor. Catalyst activity is a measure of how active the catalyst is and is reported as the mass of product polymer (P) produced per mole of catalyst (cat) used (kg P/mol cat). An “anionic ligand” is a negatively charged ligand which donates one or more pairs of electrons to a metal ion. A “neutral donor ligand” is a neutrally charged ligand which donates one or more pairs of electrons to a metal ion. A scavenger is a compound that is typically added to facilitate oligomerization or polymerization by scavenging impurities. Some scavengers may also act as activators and may be referred to as co-activators. A co-activator, that is not a scavenger, may also be used in conjunction with an activator in order to form an active catalyst. In an embodiment according to the invention, a co-activator can be pre-mixed with the catalyst compound to form an alkylated catalyst compound. A propylene polymer is a polymer having at least 50 mol % of propylene. As used herein, Mn is number average molecular weight as determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) unless stated otherwise, Mw is weight average molecular weight determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and Mz is z average molecular weight determined by GPC, wt % is weight percent, and mol % is mole percent.

In an embodiment according to the invention, two or more different catalyst compounds are present in the catalyst system used herein. In an embodiment according to the invention, two or more different catalyst compounds are present in the reaction zone where the process(es) described herein occur. When two transition metal compound based catalysts are used in one reactor as a mixed catalyst system, the two transition metal compounds are chosen such that the two are compatible. Compatible catalysts are those catalysts having similar kinetics of termination and insertion of monomer and comonomer(s) and/or do not detrimentally interact with each other. For purposes herein, the term “incompatible catalysts” refers to and means catalysts that satisfy one or more of the following: 1) those catalysts that when present together reduce the activity of at least one of the catalysts by greater than 50%; 2) those catalysts that under the same reactive conditions produce polymers such that one of the polymers has a molecular weight that is more than twice the molecular weight of the other polymer; and 3) those catalysts that differ in comonomer incorporation or reactivity ratio under the same conditions by more than about 30%. A simple screening method such as by 1H or 13C NMR, known to those of ordinary skill in the art, can be used to determine which transition metal compounds are compatible. In an embodiment according to the invention, the catalyst systems use the same activator for the catalyst compounds. In an embodiment according to the invention, two or more different activators, such as a non-coordinating anion activator and an alumoxane, can be used in combination. If one or more catalyst compounds contain an X1 or X2 ligand which is not a hydride, or a hydrocarbyl, then in an embodiment according to the invention, the alumoxane is contacted with the catalyst compounds prior to addition of the non-coordinating anion activator. In an embodiment according to the invention, when two transition metal compounds (pre-catalysts) are utilized, they may be used in any ratio. In an embodiment according to the invention, a molar ratio of a first transition metal compound (A) to a second transition metal compound (B) will fall within the range of (A:B) 1:1000 to 1000:1, or 1:100 to 500:1, or 1:10 to 200:1, or 1:1 to 100:1, or 1:1 to 75:1, or 5:1 to 50:1. The particular ratio chosen will depend on the exact pre-catalysts chosen, the method of activation, and the end product desired. In an embodiment according to the invention, when using two pre-catalysts, where both are activated with the same activator, useful mole percents, based upon the total moles of the pre-catalysts, are 10:90 to 0.1:99, or 25:75 to 99:1, or 50:50 to 99.5:0.5, or 50:50 to 99:1, or 75:25 to 99:1, or 90:10 to 99:1. Methods to Prepare the Catalyst Compounds In embodiments the symmetric transition metal compounds may be prepared by two general synthetic routes. The parent Salan ligands are prepared by a one-step Mannich reaction from the parent phenol (Reaction A) or by a two-step imine-condensation/alkylation procedure if the salicylaldehyde is used (Reaction B). The ligand is then converted into the metal dibenzyl catalyst precursor by reaction with the metal tetra-aryl starting material, e.g., tetrabenzyl, to yield the finished complex (Reaction C). Reaction A: Reaction B: Reaction C: Asymmetric transition metal compounds may be prepared by a step-wise synthetic route. The parent Salan ligands may be prepared by reaction of the salicylaldehyde with the diamine, followed by reduction with NaBH4The asymmetric ligand may then be formed by an HBr elimination reaction with a bromomethylphenol (Reaction D). The ligand may then be converted into the metal dibenzyl catalyst precursor by reaction with the metal tetrabenzyl starting material to yield the finished complex (Reaction E). Reaction D: Reaction E: Activators The terms “cocatalyst” and “activator” are used interchangeably to describe activators and are defined to be any compound which can activate any one of the catalyst compounds described above by converting the neutral catalyst compound to a catalytically active catalyst compound cation. Non-limiting activators, for example, include alumoxanes, aluminum alkyls, ionizing activators, which may be neutral or ionic, and conventional-type cocatalysts. Activators may include alumoxane compounds, modified alumoxane compounds, and ionizing anion precursor compounds that abstract a reactive, σ-bound, metal ligand making the metal complex cationic and providing a charge-balancing noncoordinating or weakly coordinating anion. In one embodiment, alumoxane activators are utilized as an activator in the catalyst composition. Alumoxanes are generally oligomeric compounds containing —Al(R1)—O— sub-units, where R1 is an alkyl radical. Examples of alumoxanes include methylalumoxane (MAO), modified methylalumoxane (MMAO), ethylalumoxane and isobutylalumoxane. Alkylalumoxanes and modified alkylalumoxanes are suitable as catalyst activators, particularly when the catalyst precursor compound comprises an abstractable ligand which is an alkyl, halide, alkoxide or amide. Mixtures of different alumoxanes and modified alumoxanes may also be used. In an embodiment according to the invention, visually clear methylalumoxane may be used. A cloudy or gelled alumoxane can be filtered to produce a clear solution or clear alumoxane can be decanted from the cloudy solution. A useful alumoxane is a modified methyl alumoxane (MMAO) described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,041,584 and/or commercially available from Akzo Chemicals, Inc. under the trade designation Modified Methylalumoxane type 3A. Solid alumoxanes may also be used. In an embodiment according to the invention, the activator is a TMA-depleted activator (where TMA is the abbreviation for trimethylaluminum). The inventors have advantageously found that using a TMA-depleted alkyl alumoxane contributes to producing a polymer with higher allyl chain ends. Commercial alumoxanes, such as methylalumoxane (MAO) and isobutylalumoxane, often tend to comprise some residual starting material as an impurity. For example, one common method of making MAO is the hydrolysis of trimethylaluminum (TMA). Such hydrolysis, however, tends to leave residual TMA in the MAO which may have negative effects on polymerization. Any methods known in the art to remove TMA may be used. In an embodiment according to the invention, for example, to produce a TMA-depleted activator, a solution of alumoxane (such as methylalumoxane), for example, 30 wt % in toluene may be diluted in toluene and the aluminum alkyl (such as TMA in the case of MAO) is removed from the solution, for example, by combination with trimethylphenol and filtration of the solid. In an embodiment according to the invention, the TMA-depleted activator comprises from about 1 wt % to about 14 wt % trimethylaluminum, or less than 13 wt %, or less than 12 wt %, or less than 10 wt %, or less than 5 wt %, or 0 wt %, and/or, greater than 0 wt %, or greater than 1 wt %. When the activator is an alumoxane (modified or unmodified), in an embodiment according to the invention, the maximum amount of activator is typically about 5000-fold molar excess Al/M over the catalyst compound (per metal catalytic site). In an embodiment according to the invention, the minimum activator-to-catalyst-compound determined according to molar concentration of the transition metal M is typically about 1 mole aluminum or less to mole of transition metal M. In an embodiment according to the invention, the activator comprises alumoxane and the alumoxane is present at a ratio of 1 mole aluminum or more to mole of catalyst compound. In an embodiment according to the invention, the minimum activator-to-catalyst-compound molar ratio is typically a 1:1 molar ratio. Other examples of Al:M ranges include from 1:1 to 500:1, or from 1:1 to 200:1, or from 1:1 to 100:1, or from 1:1 to 50:1. In an embodiment according to the invention, little or no alumoxane (i.e., less than 0.001wt %) is used in the polymerization processes described herein. In an embodiment according to the invention, alumoxane is present at 0.00 mole %, or the alumoxane is present at a molar ratio of aluminum to catalyst compound transition metal less than 500:1, or less than 300:1, or less than 100:1, or less than 1:1. Scavengers or Co-Activators In an embodiment according to the invention, the catalyst system may further include scavengers and/or co-activators. Suitable aluminum alkyl or organoaluminum compounds which may be utilized as scavengers or co-activators include, for example, trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum and the like. Other oxophilic species such as diethyl zinc may be used. In an embodiment according to the invention, the scavengers and/or co-activators are present at less than 14 wt %, or from 0.1 to 10 wt %, or from 0.5 to 7 wt %, by weight of the catalyst system.

When the support material is silica, it is heated to at least 200° C., or about 200° C. to about 850° C., or at least 600° C. for a time of about 1 minute to about 100 hours, or from about 12 hours to about 72 hours, or from about 24 hours to about 60 hours. In an embodiment according to the invention, the calcined support material must have at least some reactive hydroxyl (OH) groups to produce supported catalyst systems according to the instant disclosure. In an embodiment according to the invention, the calcined support material is contacted with at least one polymerization catalyst comprising at least one catalyst compound and an activator. In an embodiment according to the invention, the support material, having reactive surface groups, typically hydroxyl groups, is slurried in a non-polar solvent and the resulting slurry is contacted with a solution of a catalyst compound and an activator. In an embodiment according to the invention, the slurry of the support material is first contacted with the activator for a period of time in the range of from about 0.5 hours to about 24 hours, or from about 2 hours to about 16 hours, or from about 4 hours to about 8 hours. The solution of the catalyst compound is then contacted with the isolated support/activator. In an embodiment according to the invention, the supported catalyst system is generated in situ. In an alternate embodiment, the slurry of the support material is first contacted with the catalyst compound for a period of time in the range of from about 0.5 hours to about 24 hours, or from about 2 hours to about 16 hours, or from about 4 hours to about 8 hours. The slurry of the supported catalyst compound is then contacted with the activator solution. In an embodiment according to the invention, the mixture of the catalyst, activator and support is heated to about 0° C. to about 70° C., or to about 23° C. to about 60° C., or to room temperature. Contact times typically range from about 0.5 hours to about 24 hours, or from about 2 hours to about 16 hours, or from about 4 hours to about 8 hours. Suitable non-polar solvents are materials in which all of the reactants used herein, i.e., the activator and the catalyst compound are at least partially soluble and which are liquid at reaction temperatures. Suitable non-polar solvents include alkanes, such as isopentane, hexane, n-heptane, octane, nonane, and decane, although a variety of other materials including cycloalkanes, such as cyclohexane, aromatics, such as benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene, may also be employed. In an embodiment according to the invention, the activator, the catalyst compound, or a combination thereof is supported by contacting the activator, the catalyst compound, or both with a support to form a supported activator, supported catalyst, or a combination thereof, wherein the activator, the catalyst compound, or a combination thereof are deposited on, vaporized with, bonded to, incorporated within, adsorbed or absorbed in, or on, the support. In an embodiment according to the invention, the catalyst compounds, activators and/or catalyst systems disclosed herein may be combined with one or more support materials or carriers. For example, in an embodiment according to the invention, the activator is contacted with a support to form a supported activator wherein the activator is deposited on, contacted with, vaporized with, bonded to, or incorporated within, adsorbed or absorbed in, or on, a support or carrier. In an embodiment according to the invention, the catalyst, the activator, or a combination thereof may be supported using “incipient wetness”, wherein a solution comprising the activator, the catalyst compound, or a combination thereof is contacted with the support wherein the amount of the solution is about 95 to about 100 percent of the absorptive capacity of the support material. In an embodiment according to the invention, the support material is chemically treated and/or dehydrated prior to combining with the catalyst compound, activator and/or catalyst system. In an embodiment according to the invention, the support material may have various levels of dehydration, such as may be achieved by drying the support material at temperatures in the range from about 200° C. to about 1000° C. These supports may also be chemically dehydrated using water reactive compounds such as silane and organoaluminum compounds. In an embodiment according to the invention, dehydrated silica may be contacted with an organoaluminum or alumoxane compound. In an embodiment according to the invention, wherein an organoaluminum compound is used, the activator is formed in situ in the support material as a result of the reaction of, for example, trimethylaluminum and water. In an embodiment according to the invention, Lewis base-containing support substrates will react with a Lewis acidic activator to form a support bonded Lewis acid compound. The Lewis base hydroxyl groups of silica are exemplary of metal/metalloid oxides where this method of bonding to a support occurs. These embodiments are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,147,173. Other embodiments of supporting an activator are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,991, where supported non-coordinating anions derived from trisperfluorophenyl boron are described; U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,847, discusses the reaction of Group 13 Lewis acid compounds with metal oxides such as silica and illustrates the reaction of trisperfluorophenyl boron with silanol groups (the hydroxyl groups of silicon) resulting in bound anions capable of protonating transition metal organometallic catalyst compounds to form catalytically active cations counter-balanced by the bound anions. In an embodiment according to the invention, the supported activator is formed by preparing, in an agitated, temperature and pressure controlled vessel, a solution of the activator and a suitable solvent, then adding the support material at temperatures from 0° C. to 100° C., contacting the support with the activator solution for up to 24 hours, then using a combination of heat and pressure to remove the solvent to produce a free flowing powder. Temperatures can range from 40 to 120° C. and pressures from 34.5 kPa to 138 kPa (5 psia to 20 psia). An inert gas sweep can also be used in assist in removing solvent. Alternate orders of addition, such as slurrying the support material in an appropriate solvent then adding the activator, can be used. In an embodiment according to the invention, the weight percent of the activator to the support material is in the range from about 10 weight percent to about 70 weight percent, in the range from about 20 weight percent to about 60 weight percent in other embodiments, in the range from about 30 weight percent to about 50 weight percent in other embodiments, and in the range from about 30 weight percent to about 40 weight percent in yet other embodiments.

Solids concentrations in the mineral oil or liquid diluent may range from about 3 to about 30 weight percent in some embodiments; and from about 10 to about 25 weight percent in other embodiments. In an embodiment according to the invention, the catalyst compound(s), activator(s) and/or support(s) used herein may also be spray dried separately or together prior to being injected into the reactor. The spray dried catalyst may be used as a powder or solid or may be placed in a diluent and slurried into the reactor. In an embodiment according to the invention, a support is combined with one or more activators and is spray dried to form a supported activator. In an embodiment according to the invention, fumed silica is combined with methyl alumoxane and then spray dried to from supported methyl alumoxane, a support may be combined with alumoxane, spray dried and then placed in mineral oil to form a slurry useful according to the instant disclosure.

In an embodiment according to the invention, the catalyst may be spray dried by placing the catalyst compound and the activator in solution, allowing the catalyst compound and activator to react, if desired, adding a filler material such as silica and/or fumed silica, then forcing the solution at high pressures through a nozzle. The solution may be sprayed onto a surface or sprayed such that the droplets dry in midair. The method generally employed is to disperse the silica in toluene, stir in the activator solution, and then stir in the catalyst compound solution. Slurry concentrations may be about 5 to 8 wt %. This formulation may sit as a slurry for as long as 30 minutes with mild stirring or manual shaking to keep it as a suspension before spray-drying. In an embodiment according to the invention, the makeup of the dried material is about 40-50 wt % activator (e.g., alumoxane), 50-60 SiO2 and about 2 wt % catalyst compound. In an embodiment according to the invention, two or more catalyst compounds can be added together in the desired ratio in the last step. In another embodiment, more complex procedures are possible, such as addition of a first catalyst compound to the activator/filler mixture for a specified reaction time t, followed by the addition of the second catalyst compound solution, mixed for another specified time x, after which the mixture is cosprayed. Lastly, another additive, such as 1-hexene in about 10 vol % can be present in the activator/filler mixture prior to the addition of the first catalyst compound. In an embodiment according to the invention, binders are added to the mix. These can be added as a means of improving the particle morphology, i.e. narrowing the particle size distribution, lower porosity of the particles and allowing for a reduced quantity of alumoxane, which is acting as the “binder”. In an embodiment according to the invention, spray dried particles are fed into the polymerization reactor as a mineral oil slurry. Solids concentrations in oil are about 10 to 30 wt %, or 15 to 25 wt %.

In an embodiment according to the invention, one or more dienes are present in the polymer produced herein at up to 10 weight %, or at 0.00001 to 1.0 weight %, or 0.002 to 0.5 weight %, or 0.003 to 0.2 weight %, based upon the total weight of the composition. In an embodiment according to the invention, 500 ppm or less of diene is added to the polymerization, or 400 ppm or less, or 300 ppm or less. In an embodiment according to the invention, at least 50 ppm of diene is added to the polymerization, or 100 ppm or more, or 150 ppm or more. Diolefin monomers useful in this invention include any hydrocarbon structure, or C4 to C30, having at least two unsaturated bonds, wherein at least two of the unsaturated bonds are readily incorporated into a polymer by either a stereospecific or a non-stereospecific catalyst(s).

The 1-butene monomers are expected to be preferentially consumed by the polymerization process. Use of such mixed butene streams will provide an economic benefit, as these mixed streams are often waste streams from refining processes, for example, C4 raffinate streams, and can therefore be substantially less expensive than pure 1-butene.

Likewise, the process of this invention produces olefin polymers, or polyethylene and polypropylene homopolymers and copolymers. In an embodiment according to the invention, the polymers produced herein are homopolymers of ethylene or propylene, are copolymers of ethylene or having from 0 to 25 mole % (or from 0.5 to 20 mole %, or from 1 to 15 mole %, or from 3 to 10 mole %) of one or more C3 to C20 olefin comonomer (or C3 to C12 alpha-olefin, or propylene, butene, hexene, octene, decene, dodecene, or propylene, butene, hexene, octene), or are copolymers of propylene or having from 0 to 25 mole % (or from 0.5 to 20 mole %, or from 1 to 15 mole %, or from 3 to 10 mole %) of one or more of C2 or C4 to C20 olefin comonomer (or ethylene or C4 to C12 alpha-olefin, or ethylene, butene, hexene, octene, decene, dodecene, or ethylene, butene, hexene, octene). In an embodiment according to the invention, the monomer is ethylene and the comonomer is hexene, or from 1 to 15 mole % hexene, or 1 to 10 mole % hexene. In an embodiment according to the invention, the polymers produced herein have an Mw of 5,000 to 1,000,000 g/mol (e.g., 25,000 to 750,000 g/mol, or 50,000 to 500,000 g/mol), and/or an Mw/Mn of greater than 1 to 40, or 1.2 to 20, or 1.3 to 10, or 1.4 to 5, or 1.5 to 4, or 1.5 to 3. In an embodiment according to the invention, the polymer produced herein has a unimodal or multimodal molecular weight distribution as determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). By “unimodal” is meant that the GPC trace has one peak or inflection point. By “multimodal” is meant that the GPC trace has at least two peaks or inflection points. An inflection point is that point where the second derivative of the curve changes in sign (e.g., from negative to positive or vice versa). Unless otherwise indicated Mw, Mn, MWD are determined by GPC as described in US 2006/0173123 page 24-25, paragraphs [0334] to [0341], and/or by 1H NMR as described herein. In an embodiment according to the invention, the polymers may be linear in character, which may be determined by elution fractionation, wherein non-linear polymers have a CDBI of less than 45%, whereas linear polyethylene types refer to polyethylene having a CDBI of greater than 50%, the CDBI being determined as described in WO93/03093 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,206,075). In an embodiment according to the invention, the polymer produced herein has a composition distribution breadth index (CDBI) of 50% or more, or 60% or more, or 70% or more. CDBI is a measure of the composition distribution of monomer within the polymer chains and is measured by the procedure described in PCT publication WO 93/03093, published Feb. 18, 1993, specifically columns 7 and 8 as well as in Wild et al, J. Poly. Sci., Poly. Phys. Ed., Vol. 20, p. 441 (1982) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,204, including that fractions having a weight average molecular weight (Mw) below 15,000 are ignored when determining CDBI. Polymers with an Mw/Mn of 4.5 or less may include a significant level of long chain branching. The long chain branching is understood to be the result of the incorporation of terminally unsaturated polymer chains (formed by the specific termination reaction mechanism encountered with single site catalysts) into other polymer chains in a manner analogous to monomer incorporation. The branches are hence believed to be linear in structure and may be present at a level where no peaks can be specifically attributed to such long chain branches in the 13C NMR spectrum. In an embodiment according to the invention, the polymers produced according to the instant disclosure comprise a significant amount of long chain branching, defined as having a ratio of long chain branching of at least 7 carbons per 1000 carbon atoms as determined according to the 13C NMR spectrum of greater than 0.5. In an embodiment according to the invention, the ratio of long chain branching with branches having at least 7 carbons, per 1000 carbon atoms as determined according to the 13C NMR spectrum is greater than 1, or greater than 1.5, or greater than 2. In an embodiment according to the invention, the polymers produced according to the instant disclosure include a significant amount of vinyl termination, defined as a ratio of vinyl groups per molecule of greater than or equal to 0.2.

As used herein, “highly isotactic” is defined as having at least 60% isotactic pentads according to analysis by 13C-NMR. In a desirable embodiment, the vinyl terminated polyolefin (preferably polypropylene) has at least 85% isotacticity. As used herein, “syndiotactic” is defined as having at least 10% syndiotactic pentads, preferably at least 40%, according to analysis by 13C-NMR.

This invention relates to ethylene polymers having both vinyl termination and long chain branching, which in an embodiment according to the invention, are produced by the processes and using the catalyst disclosed herein.

In an embodiment according to the invention, polymer produced herein has less than 1400 ppm aluminum, or less than 1200 ppm, or less than 1000 ppm, or less than 500 ppm, or less than 100 ppm as determined by ICPES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometry), which is described in J. W. Olesik, “Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy,” in the Encyclopedia of Materials Characterization, C. R. Brundle, C. A. Evans, Jr. and S. Wilson, eds., Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, Mass., 1992, pp. 633-644, which is used herein for purposes of determining the amount of an element in a material; and/or in an embodiment according to the invention, the polymer has less than 1400 ppm of the Group 3, 4, 5, or 6 transition metal, or of the Group 4 transition metal, or of Ti, Zr, and/or Hf, or less than 1200 ppm, or less than 1000 ppm, or less than 500 ppm, or less than 100 ppm, as determined by ICPES as discussed above. In an embodiment according to the invention, an ethylene polymer according to the instant disclosure has less than 1400 ppm hafnium, or less than 1200 ppm, or less than 1000 ppm, or less than 500 ppm, or less than 100 ppm as determined by ICPES. In an embodiment according to the invention, an ethylene polymer according to the instant disclosure has less than 1400 ppm zirconium, or less than 1200 ppm, or less than 1000 ppm, or less than 500 ppm, or less than 100 ppm as determined by ICPES. In an embodiment according to the invention, the polymer produced herein, which may be an ethylene polymer, has a density of greater than 0.95 g/cc, or greater than 0.955 g/cc, or greater than 0.96 g/cc. In an embodiment according to the invention, the ethylene polymer produced herein has a branching index (g′vis) of 0.9 or less, or 0.85 or less, or 0.80 or less, where g′vis is determined as described below. For purposes herein, Mw, Mz number of carbon atoms, g value and g′vis are determined by using a High Temperature Size Exclusion Chromatograph (either from Waters Corporation or Polymer Laboratories), equipped with three in-line detectors, a differential refractive index detector (DRI), a light scattering (LS) detector, and a viscometer. Experimental details, including detector calibration, are described in: T. Sun, P. Brant, R. R. Chance, and W. W. Graessley, Macromolecules, Volume 34, Number 19, 6812-6820, (2001) and references therein. Three Polymer Laboratories PLgel 10 mm Mixed-B LS columns are used. The nominal flow rate is 0.5 cm3/min, and the nominal injection volume is 300 μL. The various transfer lines, columns and differential refractometer (the DRI detector) are contained in an oven maintained at 145° C. Solvent for the experiment is prepared by dissolving 6 grams of butylated hydroxy toluene as an antioxidant in 4 liters of Aldrich reagent grade 1, 2, 4 trichlorobenzene (TCB). The TCB mixture is then filtered through a 0.7 μm glass pre-filter and subsequently through a 0.1 μm Teflon filter. The TCB is then degassed with an online degasser before entering the Size Exclusion Chromatograph. Polymer solutions are prepared by placing dry polymer in a glass container, adding the desired amount of TCB, then heating the mixture at 160° C. with continuous agitation for about 2 hours. All quantities are measured gravimetrically. The TCB densities used to express the polymer concentration in mass/volume units are 1.463 g/ml at room temperature and 1.324 g/ml at 14 5° C. The injection concentration is from 0.75 to 2.0 mg/ml, with lower concentrations being used for higher molecular weight samples. Prior to running each sample the DRI detector and the injector are purged. Flow rate in the apparatus is then increased to 0.5 ml/minute, and the DRI is allowed to stabilize for 8 to 9 hours before injecting the first sample. The LS laser is turned on 1 to 1.5 hours before running the samples. The concentration, c, at each point in the chromatogram is calculated from the baseline-subtracted DRI signal, IDRI, using the following equation: [in-line-formulae]c=KDRIIDRI/(dn/dc)[/in-line-formulae] where KDRI is a constant determined by calibrating the DRI, and (dn/dc) is the refractive index increment for the system. The refractive index, n=1.500 for TCB at 145° C. and 2=690 nm. For purposes of this invention and the claims thereto (dn/dc)=0.104 for propylene polymers, 0.098 for butene polymers and 0.1 otherwise. Units on parameters throughout this description of the SEC method are such that concentration is expressed in g/cm3, molecular weight is expressed in g/mole, and intrinsic viscosity is expressed in dL/g. The LS detector is a Wyatt Technology High Temperature mini-DAWN. The molecular weight, M, at each point in the chromatogram is determined by analyzing the LS output using the Zimm model for static light scattering (M.B. Huglin, LIGHT SCATTERING FROM POLYMER SOLUTIONS, Academic Press, 1971): K o  c Δ   R  ( θ ) = 1 MP  ( θ ) + 2  A 2  c Here, ΔR(θ) is the measured excess Rayleigh scattering intensity at scattering angle θ, c is the polymer concentration determined from the DRI analysis, A2 is the second virial coefficient [for purposes of this invention, A2=0.0006 for propylene polymers, 0.0015 for butene polymers and 0.001 otherwise], (dn/dc)=0.104 for propylene polymers, 0.098 for butene polymers and 0.1 otherwise, P(θ) is the form factor for a monodisperse random coil, and Ko is the optical constant for the system: K o = 4  π 2  n 2  (  n /  c ) 2 λ 4  N A where NA is Avogadro's number, and (dn/dc) is the refractive index increment for the system. The refractive index, n=1.500 for TCB at 145° C. and λ=690 nm. A high temperature Viscotek Corporation viscometer, which has four capillaries arranged in a Wheatstone bridge configuration with two pressure transducers, is used to determine specific viscosity. One transducer measures the total pressure drop across the detector, and the other, positioned between the two sides of the bridge, measures a differential pressure. The specific viscosity, ηs, for the solution flowing through the viscometer is calculated from their outputs. The intrinsic viscosity, [η], at each point in the chromatogram is calculated from the following equation: [in-line-formulae]ηs=c[η]+0.3(c[η])2 [/in-line-formulae] where c is concentration and was determined from the DRI output. The branching index (g′vis) is calculated using the output of the SEC-DRI-LS-VIS method as follows. The average intrinsic viscosity, [η]avg, of the sample is calculated by: [ η ] avg = ∑ c i  [ η ] i ∑ c i where the summations are over the chromatographic slices, i, between the integration limits. The branching index g′vis is defined as: g ′  vis = [ η ] avg kM v α where, for purpose of this invention and claims thereto, α=0.695 and k=0.000579 for linear ethylene polymers, α=0.705 k=0.000262 for linear propylene polymers, and α=0.695 and k=0.000181 for linear butene polymers. Mv is the viscosity-average molecular weight based on molecular weights determined by LS analysis. Also called a “g value”, “g” is defined to be Rg2pm/Rg2ls, where Rgpm is the radius of gyration for the polymacromer, Rg2ls is the radius of gyration for the linear standard, and Rgls=KsM0.58 where Ks is the power law coefficient (0.023 for linear polyethylene, 0.0171 for linear polypropylene, and 0.0145 for linear polybutene), and M is the molecular weight as described above, Rgpm=KTMαs, αs is the size coefficient for the polymacromer, KT is the power law coefficient for the polymacromer. See Macromolecules, 2001, 34, 6812-6820, for guidance on selecting a linear standards having the molecular weight and comonomer content, and determining K coefficients and α exponents. In an embodiment of the invention, the instant catalyst is used to produce vinyl terminated polymers having unsaturated chain end or terminus. The unsaturated chain end of the vinyl terminated macromonomer comprises an “allyl chain end”, a vinylidene chain end, or a “3-alkyl” chain end. An allyl chain end is represented by CH2CH—CH2—, as shown in the formula: where M represents the polymer chain. “Allylic vinyl group,” “allyl chain end,” “vinyl chain end,” “vinyl termination,” “allylic vinyl group,” and “vinyl terminated” are used interchangeably in the following description. The number of allyl chain ends, vinylidene chain ends, vinylene chain ends, and other unsaturated chain ends is determined using 1H NMR at 120° C. using deuterated tetrachloroethane as the solvent on an at least 250 MHz NMR spectrometer, and in selected cases, confirmed by 13C NMR. Resconi has reported proton and carbon assignments (neat perdeuterated tetrachloroethane used for proton spectra, while a 50:50 mixture of normal and perdeuterated tetrachloroethane was used for carbon spectra; all spectra were recorded at 100° C. on a BRUKER spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for proton and 125 MHz for carbon) for vinyl terminated oligomers in J. American Chemical Soc., 114, 1992, pp. 1025-1032 that are useful herein. Allyl chain ends are reported as a molar percentage of the total number of moles of unsaturated groups (that is, the sum of allyl chain ends, vinylidene chain ends, vinylene chain ends, and the like). A vinylidene chain end is represented by the formula: where R can be H, alkyl, aryl aralkyl, or alkaryl. A 3-alkyl chain end (where the alkyl is a C1 to C38 alkyl), also referred to as a “3-alkyl vinyl end group” or a “3-alkyl vinyl termination”, is represented by the formula: where “••••” represents the polyolefin chain and Rb is a C1 to C38 alkyl group, or a C1 to C20 alkyl group, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, and the like. The amount of 3-alkyl chain ends is determined using 13C NMR as set out below. 13C NMR data may be collected at 120° C. at a frequency of at least 100 MHz, using a BRUKER 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. A 90 degree pulse, an acquisition time adjusted to give a digital resolution between 0.1 and 0.12 Hz, at least a 10 second pulse acquisition delay time with continuous broadband proton decoupling using swept square wave modulation without gating is employed during the entire acquisition period. The spectra is acquired with time averaging to provide a signal to noise level adequate to measure the signals of interest. Samples are dissolved in tetrachloroethane-d2 at concentrations between 10 wt % to 15 wt % prior to being inserted into the spectrometer magnet. Prior to data analysis spectra are referenced by setting the chemical shift of the TCE solvent signal to 74.39 ppm. Chain ends for quantization were identified using the signals shown in the table below. Unless otherwise indicated, n-butyl and n-propyl may not be reported if their abundance is less than 5% relative to the chain ends detected. In the alternative, 13C NMR data may be collected at 120° C. in a 10 mm probe using a Varian spectrometer with a 1H frequency of at least 400 MHz. A 90 degree pulse, an acquisition time adjusted to give a digital resolution between 0.1 and 0.12 Hz, at least a 10 second pulse acquisition delay time with continuous broadband proton decoupling using swept square wave modulation without gating was employed during the entire acquisition period. The spectra were acquired using time averaging to provide a signal to noise level adequate to measure the signals of interest. Samples were dissolved in tetrachloroethane-d2 at concentrations between 10 to 15wt % prior to being inserted into the spectrometer magnet. Prior to data analysis spectra were referenced by setting the chemical shift of the (—CH2—)n signal where n>6 to 29.9 ppm. Chain ends for quantization were identified using the signals shown in the table below. N-butyl and n-propyl were not reported due to their low abundance (less than 5%) relative to the chain ends shown in the table below. Chain End 13CNMR Chemical Shift P~i-Bu 23-5 to 25.5 and 25.8 to 26.3 ppm E~i-Bu 39.5 to 40.2 ppm P~Vinyl 41.5 to 43 ppm E~Vinyl 33.9 to 34.4 ppm Samples are dissolved in d2-1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, and spectra recorded at 125° C. using a 100 MHz (or higher) NMR spectrometer. Polymer resonance peaks are referenced to mmmm=21.8 ppm. Calculations involved in the characterization of polymers by NMR are described by F. A. Bovey in Polymer Conformation and Configuration (Academic Press, New York 1969) and J. Randall in Polymer Sequence Determination, 13C-NMR Method (Academic Press, New York, 1977). The “allyl chain end to vinylidene chain end ratio” is defined to be the ratio of the percentage of allyl chain ends to the percentage of vinylidene chain ends. The “allyl chain end to vinylene chain end ratio” is defined to be the ratio of the percentage of allyl chain ends to the percentage of vinylene chain ends. Vinyl terminated polymers typically also have a saturated chain end, also referred to as a methyl end. In polymerizations comprising C4 or greater monomers (or “higher olefin” monomers), the saturated chain end may be a C4 or greater (or “higher olefin”) chain end, as shown in the formula below: where M represents the polymer chain and n is an integer selected from 4 to 40. This is especially true when there is substantially no ethylene or propylene in the polymerization. In an ethylene/(C4 or greater monomer) copolymerization, the polymer chain may initiate growth in an ethylene monomer, thereby generating a saturated chain end which is an ethyl chain end. In polymerizations where propylene is present, the polymer chain may initiate growth in a propylene monomer, thereby generating an isobutyl chain end. An “isobutyl chain end” is defined to be an end or terminus of a polymer, represented as shown in the formula below: where M represents the polymer chain. Isobutyl chain ends are determined according to the procedure set out in WO 2009/155471. The “isobutyl chain end to allylic vinyl group ratio” is defined to be the ratio of the percentage of isobutyl chain ends to the percentage of allyl chain ends. In an embodiment of the invention, the propylene polymer produced using the instant catalyst comprises at least 50% vinyl or unsaturated chain ends. In an embodiment of the invention, at least 90%, or at least 95%, or at least 99% vinylidene chain ends. Mn (1H NMR) may be determined according to the following NMR method. 1H NMR data is collected at either room temperature or 120° C. (for purposes of the claims, 120° C. shall be used) in a 5 mm probe using a Varian spectrometer with a 1H frequency of 250 MHz, 400 MHz, or 500 MHz (for the purpose of the claims, a proton frequency of 400 MHz is used). Data are recorded using a maximum pulse width of 45° C., 8 seconds between pulses and signal averaging 120 transients. Spectral signals are integrated and the number of unsaturation types per 1000 carbons are calculated by multiplying the different groups by 1000 and dividing the result by the total number of carbons. Mn is calculated by dividing the total number of unsaturated species into 14,000, and has units of g/mol. The chemical shift regions for the olefin types are defined to be between the following spectral regions. Number of hydrogens Unsaturation Type Region (ppm) per structure Allylic Vinyl 4.95-5.10 2 Vinylidene 4.70-4.84 2 Disubstituted Vinylene 5.31-5.55 2 Trisubstituted Vinylene 5.11-5.30 1 Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) Crystallization temperature (Tc), melting temperature (or melting point, Tm), glass transition temperature (Tg) and heat of fusion (Hf) are measured using Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) on a commercially available instrument (e.g., TA Instruments 2920 DSC). Typically, 6 to 10 mg of molded polymer or plasticized polymer are sealed in an aluminum pan and loaded into the instrument at room temperature. Data are acquired by heating the sample to at least 30° C. above its melting temperature, typically 220° C. for polypropylene, at a heating rate of 10° C./min. The sample is held for at least 5 minutes at this temperature to destroy its thermal history. Then the sample is cooled from the melt to at least 50° C. below the crystallization temperature, typically −100° C. for polypropylene, at a cooling rate of 20° C./min. The sample is held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes, and finally heated at 10° C./min to acquire additional melting data (second heat). The endothermic melting transition (first and second heat) and exothermic crystallization transition are analyzed according to standard procedures. The melting temperatures (Tm) reported are the peak melting temperatures from the second heat unless otherwise specified. For polymers displaying multiple peaks, the melting temperature is defined to be the peak melting temperature from the melting trace associated with the largest endothermic calorimetric response (as opposed to the peak occurring at the highest temperature). Likewise, the crystallization temperature is defined to be the peak crystallization temperature from the crystallization trace associated with the largest exothermic calorimetric response (as opposed to the peak occurring at the highest temperature). Areas under the DSC curve are used to determine the heat of transition (heat of fusion, Hf, upon melting or heat of crystallization, Hc, upon crystallization), which can be used to calculate the degree of crystallinity (also called the percent crystallinity). The percent crystallinity (X%) is calculated using the formula: [area under the curve (in J/g)/H° (in J/g)]*100, where H° is the ideal heat of fusion for a perfect crystal of the homopolymer of the major monomer component. These values for H° are to be obtained from the Polymer Handbook, Fourth Edition, published by John Wiley and Sons, New York 1999, except that a value of 290 J/g is used for H° (polyethylene), a value of 140 J/g is used for H° (polybutene), and a value of 207 J/g is used for H° (polypropylene). Heat of melting (Hm) is determined using the DSC procedure above except that the sample is cooled to −100° C., held for 5 minutes then heated at 10° C./min to 200° C. Hm is measured on the first melt, no the second melt. The Hm sample must have been aged at least 48 hours at room temperature and should not be heated to destroy thermal history. Ethylene Content Ethylene content in ethylene copolymers is determined by ASTM D 5017-96, or an equivalent thereof, except that the minimum signal-to-noise should be 10,000:1. Propylene content in propylene copolymers is determined by following the approach of Method 1 in Di Martino and Kelchermans, J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 56, 1781 (1995), and using peak assignments from Zhang, Polymer 45, 2651 (2004) for higher olefin comonomers. Mn, Mw, and Mz may also be measured by using a Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) method using a High Temperature Size Exclusion Chromatograph (SEC, either from Waters Corporation or Polymer Laboratories), equipped with a differential refractive index detector (DRI). Experimental details, are described in: T. Sun, P. Brant, R. R. Chance, and W. W. Graessley, Macromolecules, Volume 34, Number 19, pp. 6812-6820, (2001) and references therein. Three Polymer Laboratories PLgel 10 mm Mixed-B columns are used. The nominal flow rate is 0.5 cm3/min and the nominal injection volume is 300 μl. The various transfer lines, columns and differential refractometer (the DRI detector) are contained in an oven maintained at 135° C. Solvent for the SEC experiment is prepared by dissolving 6 grams of butylated hydroxy toluene as an antioxidant in 4 liters of Aldrich reagent grade 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene (TCB). The TCB mixture is then filtered through a 0.7 μm glass pre-filter and subsequently through a 0.1 μm Teflon filter. The TCB is then degassed with an online degasser before entering the SEC. Polymer solutions are prepared by placing dry polymer in a glass container, adding the desired amount of TCB, then heating the mixture at 160° C. with continuous agitation for about 2 hours. All quantities are measured gravimetrically. The TCB densities used to express the polymer concentration in mass/volume units are 1.463 g/mL at room temperature and 1.324 g/mL at 135° C. The injection concentration is from 1.0 to 2.0 mg/mL, with lower concentrations being used for higher molecular weight samples. Prior to running each sample the DRI detector and the injector are purged. Flow rate in the apparatus is then increased to 0.5 mL/minute, and the DRI is allowed to stabilize for 8 to 9 hours before injecting the first sample. The concentration, c, at each point in the chromatogram is calculated from the baseline-subtracted DRI signal, IDRI, using the following equation: [in-line-formulae]c=KDRIIDRI/(dn/dc)[/in-line-formulae] where KDRI is a constant determined by calibrating the DRI, and (dn/dc) is the refractive index increment for the system. The refractive index, n=1.500 for TCB at 135° C. and λ=690 nm. For purposes of this invention and the claims thereto (dn/dc)=0.104 for propylene polymers and ethylene polymers, and 0.1 otherwise. Units of parameters used throughout this description of the SEC method are: concentration is expressed in g/cm3, molecular weight is expressed in g/mol, and intrinsic viscosity is expressed in dL/g. Blends In an embodiment according to the invention, the polymer (or the polyethylene or polypropylene) produced herein is combined with one or more additional polymers prior to being formed into a film, molded part or other article. Other useful polymers include polyethylene, isotactic polypropylene, highly isotactic polypropylene, syndiotactic polypropylene, random copolymer of propylene and ethylene, and/or butene, and/or hexene, polybutene, ethylene vinyl acetate, LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE, ethylene vinyl acetate, ethylene methyl acrylate, copolymers of acrylic acid, polymethylmethacrylate or any other polymers polymerizable by a high-pressure free radical process, polyvinylchloride, polybutene-1, isotactic polybutene, ABS resins, ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR), vulcanized EPR, EPDM, block copolymer, styrenic block copolymers, polyamides, polycarbonates, PET resins, cross linked polyethylene, copolymers of ethylene and vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polymers of aromatic monomers such as polystyrene, poly-1 esters, polyacetal, polyvinylidine fluoride, polyethylene glycols, and/or polyisobutylene. In an embodiment according to the invention, the polymer (or the polyethylene or polypropylene) is present in the above blends, at from 10 to 99 wt %, based upon the weight of the polymers in the blend, or 20 to 95 wt %, or at least 30 to 90 wt %, or at least 40 to 90 wt %, or at least 50 to 90 wt %, or at least 60 to 90 wt %, or at least 70 to 90 wt %. The blends described above may be produced by mixing the polymers of the invention with one or more polymers (as described above), by connecting reactors together in series to make reactor blends or by using more than one catalyst in the same reactor to produce multiple species of polymer. The polymers can be mixed together prior to being put into the extruder or may be mixed in an extruder. The blends may be formed using conventional equipment and methods, such as by dry blending the individual components and subsequently melt mixing in a mixer, or by mixing the components together directly in a mixer, such as, for example, a Banbury mixer, a Haake mixer, a Brabender internal mixer, or a single or twin-screw extruder, which may include a compounding extruder and a side-arm extruder used directly downstream of a polymerization process, which may include blending powders or pellets of the resins at the hopper of the film extruder. Additionally, additives may be included in the blend, in one or more components of the blend, and/or in a product formed from the blend, such as a film, as desired. Such additives are well known in the art, and can include, for example: fillers; antioxidants (e.g., hindered phenolics such as IRGANOX 1010 or IRGANOX 1076 available from Ciba-Geigy); phosphites (e.g., IRGAFOS 168 available from Ciba-Geigy); anti-cling additives; tackifiers, such as polybutenes, terpene resins, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon resins, alkali metal and glycerol stearates, and hydrogenated rosins; UV stabilizers; heat stabilizers; anti-blocking agents; release agents; anti-static agents; pigments; colorants; dyes; waxes; silica; fillers; talc; and the like. Films In an embodiment according to the invention, any of the foregoing polymers, such as the foregoing polypropylenes or blends thereof, may be used in a variety of end-use applications. Applications include, for example, mono- or multi-layer blown, extruded, and/or shrink films. These films may be formed by any number of well-known extrusion or coextrusion techniques, such as a blown bubble film processing technique, wherein the composition can be extruded in a molten state through an annular die and then expanded to form a uniaxial or biaxial orientation melt prior to being cooled to form a tubular, blown film, which can then be axially slit and unfolded to form a flat film. Films may be subsequently unoriented, uniaxially oriented, or biaxially oriented to the same or different extents. One or more of the layers of the film may be oriented in the transverse and/or longitudinal directions to the same or different extents. The uniaxial orientation can be accomplished using typical cold drawing or hot drawing methods. Biaxial orientation can be accomplished using tenter frame equipment or a double bubble processes and may occur before or after the individual layers are brought together. For example, a polyethylene layer can be extrusion coated or laminated onto an oriented polypropylene layer or the polyethylene and polypropylene can be coextruded together into a film then oriented. Likewise, oriented polypropylene could be laminated to oriented polyethylene or oriented polyethylene could be coated onto polypropylene then optionally the combination could be oriented even further. Typically the films are oriented in the machine direction (MD) at a ratio of up to 15, or between 5 and 7, and in the transverse direction (TD) at a ratio of up to 15, or 7 to 9. However, in an embodiment according to the invention, the film is oriented to the same extent in both the MD and TD directions. The films may vary in thickness depending on the intended application; however, films of a thickness from 1 to 50 μm are usually suitable. Films intended for packaging are usually from 10 to 50 μm thick. The thickness of the sealing layer is typically 0.2 to 50 μm. There may be a sealing layer on both the inner and outer surfaces of the film or the sealing layer may be present on only the inner or the outer surface. In an embodiment according to the invention, one or more layers may be modified by corona treatment, electron beam irradiation, gamma irradiation, flame treatment, or microwave. In an embodiment according to the invention, one or both of the surface layers is modified by corona treatment. Molded Products The compositions described herein (or polypropylene compositions) may also be used to prepare molded products in any molding process, including but not limited to, injection molding, gas-assisted injection molding, extrusion blow molding, injection blow molding, injection stretch blow molding, compression molding, rotational molding, foam molding, thermoforming, sheet extrusion, and profile extrusion. The molding processes are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Further, the compositions described herein (or polypropylene compositions) may be shaped into desirable end use articles by any suitable means known in the art. Thermoforming, vacuum forming, blow molding, rotational molding, slush molding, transfer molding, wet lay-up or contact molding, cast molding, cold forming matched-die molding, injection molding, spray techniques, profile co-extrusion, or combinations thereof are typically used methods. Thermoforming is a process of forming at least one pliable plastic sheet into a desired shape. Typically, an extrudate film of the composition of this invention (and any other layers or materials) is placed on a shuttle rack to hold it during heating. The shuttle rack indexes into the oven which pre-heats the film before forming. Once the film is heated, the shuttle rack indexes back to the forming tool. The film is then vacuumed onto the forming tool to hold it in place and the forming tool is closed. The tool stays closed to cool the film and the tool is then opened. The shaped laminate is then removed from the tool. The thermoforming is accomplished by vacuum, positive air pressure, plug-assisted vacuum forming, or combinations and variations of these, once the sheet of material reaches thermoforming temperatures, typically of from 140° C. to 185° C. or higher. A pre-stretched bubble step is used, especially on large parts, to improve material distribution. Blow molding is another suitable forming means for use with the compositions of this invention, which includes injection blow molding, multi-layer blow molding, extrusion blow molding, and stretch blow molding, and is especially suitable for substantially closed or hollow objects, such as, for example, gas tanks and other fluid containers. Blow molding is described in more detail in, for example, CONCISE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF POLYMER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 90-92 (Jacqueline I. Kroschwitz, ed., John Wiley & Sons 1990). Likewise, molded articles may be fabricated by injecting molten polymer into a mold that shapes and solidifies the molten polymer into desirable geometry and thickness of molded articles. Sheets may be made either by extruding a substantially flat profile from a die, onto a chill roll, or by calendaring. Sheets are generally considered to have a thickness of from 254 μm to 2540 μm (10 mils to 100 mils), although any given sheet may be substantially thicker. Non-Wovens and Fibers The polyolefin compositions described above may also be used to prepare nonwoven fabrics and fibers of this invention in any nonwoven fabric and fiber making process, including but not limited to, melt blowing, spunbonding, film aperturing, and staple fiber carding. A continuous filament process may also be used, or a spunbonding process may be used. The spunbonding process is well known in the art. Generally it involves the extrusion of fibers through a spinneret. These fibers are then drawn using high velocity air and laid on an endless belt. A calender roll is generally then used to heat the web and bond the fibers to one another although other techniques may be used such as sonic bonding and adhesive bonding.

Compounds B through F were made in a similar manner from compounds 6, 9, 3, 13, or 15 and the corresponding Group IV tetrabenzyl precursors. All reactions were performed under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. Solvents were anhydrous grade from Sigma Aldrich which were sparged with nitrogen and stored over alumina beads (activated at 300° C.) before use. Deuterated solvents were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, Mass.) and dried over 3 Å molecular sieves. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.) and used as received, unless otherwise noted. All 1H NMR data were collected on a Broker AVANCE III 400 MHz spectrometer running Topspin™ 3.0 software at room temperature (approx. 23° C.). Tetrachloroethane-d2 was used as a solvent (chemical shift of 5.98 ppm was used as a reference) for all materials. Methyl Alumoxane Supported on Silica (SMAO): In a celstir flask a 13.8 gram amount of Grace 948 silica that was previously calcined at 600° C. was slurried in 110 mL of toluene and heated to 80° C. MAO (30% by weight in toluene) (23.5152 g solution) was slowly added to the slurry. The slurry was stirred for 1 hr before being filtered and washed 4 times with 50 mL of toluene and dried under vacuum. 19.9883 g of a white solid was collected. Representative Sample for Slurry SMAO Preparation: Catalyst B (25.2 mg) was dissolved in 5 mL of toluene. This solution was added to a slurry of SMAO (0.822 g) in 25 mL of toluene.

Then Davidson 948 silica (30 g), which had been calcined at 600° C., was added. The mixture was heated to 100° C. and the mixture was swirled occasionally. After 3 hours the mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and the solids were collected on a glass fritted disk. The product was dried under reduced pressure for 22 hours to afford a free-flowing white solid (40.5 g). Preparation of Catalyst D/SMAO-2 A toluene (5 mL) solution of catalyst compound D (0.0500 g, 0.0491 mmol) was combined with SMAO-2 (1.23 g, 5.89 mmol Al). The mixture was swirled. After 5 minutes the solids were collected on a glass frit, washed with toluene (3×5 mL), and dried under reduced pressure to afford a white powder (1.26 g). Preparation of Catalyst B/SMAO-2 A toluene (5 mL) solution of catalyst compound B (0.0482 g, 0.0514 mmol) was combined with SMAO-2 (1.29 g, 6.16 mmol Al). The mixture was swirled. After 5 minutes the solids were collected on a glass frit, washed with toluene (3×5 mL), and dried under reduced pressure to afford a pale yellow powder (1.33 g). General Procedure for Ethylene Polymerizations Semi-continuous ethylene polymerizations were performed in a stirred 1 L autoclave reactor. Details of polymerization conditions and the products formed are described in Table 1. All solvents, reactants, and gases were purified by passing through multiple columns containing 3 angstrom molecular sieves and oxygen scavenger. Typically, isohexane (500 mL) and scavenger (tri-n-octylaluminum, 0.10 mmol) was added to the reactor and the mixture was heated to the desired temperature. The reactor was then pressurized with ethylene to a pressure 137.9 kPa to 241.3 kPa (20-35 psi) below the final reaction pressure. Once the reactor had equilibrated a slurry of the catalyst in toluene (2 mL) was pushed in with ethylene gas at the final reaction pressure. Polymerization was carried out for a set amount of time and then the reactor was cooled, depressurized, and opened. The residual volatiles in the product were removed under a stream of nitrogen, followed by heating the sample in a vacuum oven at 60° C.
