415C47 This invention relates to cigar "bunoh shaping mech¬ anism, particularly for the shaping of short filler cigar bunches, and especially to shaping mechanism of the turret type, in which a plurality of shaping pockets are mounted on or formed integrally with a rotatahle turret, and are provided with removable shaping covers, and the turret is rotated step by step to present each shaping unit in succession to a cover removing and replacing mechanism and to bunch removing and pocket filling mechanisms operating in timed relation to each other at a bunch unloading and loading station of the turret, so that a continuous succession of bunches is always under¬ going shaping. The objects of the invention are to provide an improved and simplified mechanism for removing and replacing the bunch shaping covers from and on the respective pockets, and to provide improved mechanism for holding the bunch shaping covers in proper shaping relationship with respect to the bunch shaping pockets, during rotation of the turret without requiring external cooperating mechanism for this purpose. The invention consists in a bunch shaping mechanism comprising a rotatable support, a plurality of shaping pockets thereon, a plurality of covers each cooperating with one of said pockets to shape a cigar bunch placed in said pocket, each cover being bodily removable from its pocket to permit insertion of a bunch therein, and means coacting between each pocket and the cover thereof to hold said cover in proper shaping position during rotation of said support. Said means may comprise spring-pressed detents or balls on each cover adapted to engage indentations formed in the inner faces of the pocket, or may comprise a spring-pressed latch member on r- 7 'M -2- A. each pocket adapted to extend through a slot in the cover and to engage an exterior surface thereof. The invention also consists in a hunch shaping meohanism comprising a rotatahle support, a plurality of shaping pockets thereon, a plurality of covers each cooperat¬ ing with one of said pockets to shape a cigar hunch placed in said pocket, and mechanism disposed at an unloading and load¬ ing station of said support and operable to individually remove and then replace each cover in succession, said meohanism comprising a gripping device, means for operating said device to grip a part of each cover to enable said mechanism to remove and replace the cover, and means for operating said device after such replacement to release the cover. The gripping device may he spring-operated in the direction to grip the part of the cover. The invention further consists in that each cover is secured to the corresponding pocket by a latch on said pocket coacting with a part of the cover, and a part of said gripping device when the latter is operated to grip the aforesaid cover part is adapted to engage and release said latch. The invention also consists in certain other com¬ binations and constructions which will be hereinafter fully described, and then set forth in the claims hereunto appended. In the accompanying drawings:- Figure 1 is a side elevation, partly in section, of part of a cigar bunch shaping mechanism in accordance with the invention, Figure 2 is a sectional end elevation taken on the line Z-'l of Figure 1, Figure 3 is a plan view of the cover removing and replacing mechanism, as seen from the line 3-3 of Figure 1, Figure 4 is a partial sectional end elevation taken at the position of the line 4-4 of Figure 1, showing another form of device for holding the covers in place on the shap¬ ing pockets, Figure 5 is a partial sectional side elevation showing a modified, form of the invention, and Figure 6 is a partial sectional side elevation il¬ lustrating another form ot> the invention. Referring to Figures 1 to 3, which show one modi¬ fication of the invention, a stationary support 8 supports the shaft 10 of a hunch shaping turret 11 which may be rotated intermittently or step-by-step "by means of any suitable or known form of indexing device. A stationary support 9 sup¬ ports a shaft 15, on which is loosely mounted a buiich loading arm 16. Fixedly attached to the shaft 15 is a lever 57 which is connected to the arm 16 by a link 56, a cross-head 55, a compression spring 58» and guide rods 54. Shaft 15 is o rotated in opposite directions through approximately 180 to move the arm 16 from bunch receiving position to bunch loading position and back again, by means of a gear 59 on the shaft and a gear segment 60 secured to a shaft 17. The shaft 17 is rotated by means of a crank arm 61 attached thereto, and a rod 62 operated by means of a suitable cam. The arm 16 carries a loading pocket 51 into which a bunch is placed by 1Qj an operation in the bunch receiving position of the arm, and the pocket has a movable bottom 52. When the arm 16 is moved into its bunch loading position, thé pocket 51 comes to rest adjacent the shaping pocket 19 at the top of the turret, and by the continued movement of the lever 57 relatively to the arm 16, acting through the rods 54, tne bottom 52 is moved downwardly to eject the bunch into the shaping pocket 19. At the same time a knife 64 mounted on the cross-head moves downwardly to trim one end of the bunch. The stationary support 8 carries a shaft 13, which o is rocked through approximately 90 by a crank arm 47 oper- \ 415017 atel by a suitable cam through the medium of a rod 49. On the ahaft 13 is loosely mounted an arm 14, and fixedly attached to the shaft is a lever 12. ihe arm 14, as shown, in Fig. 3, is forked at both ems, and the lever 12 is mounted between the two hub portions thereof. On pins 18, between the fork portions at its other end, the arm 14 carries a pair of toell¬ es rank levers 25 and 26 formed to provide jaws 27 and 28, respectively, the levers being operated by means of a pin 29 in the outer end of the lever 12 engaging in slots in the overlapping forked inner ends of the levers. The covers 20 of the pockets 19 on the turret are provided with dovetailed ex¬ tensions 30, and the jaws 27 and 28 are arranged to be held in closed position against these extensions by compression springs 31 acting between the levers 25 and 2S and socket members 32 and 33 on the arm 14. In the structure shown, the gripping faces of the jaws 27 and 28 are provided with taper¬ ed pins 34 (Mgure 3) which are adapted to seat themselves in V-grooves or notches 35 formed in the outer edges of the extensions 30 (Figures 1 and 3), thus providing positive means for aligning the covers with the pockets 19 oircumferentisilly of the turret 11. If desired, projections may be formed integrally with the jaws 27 and 28 for cooperation with the extensions 30 in this manner. In order to locate each cover in a definite axial position with respect to its respective pocket, a projection 27a on the jaw 27 engages the socket member 32, which limits the inward or closing movement of this jaw, the other jaw moving sufficiently to securely hold the portion of the cover between the jaws. A certain lost motion in the pin and slot connection between the levers 25,26 and the lever 12 makes this possible. During each step-by-step movement of the turret 11, the arm 14 occupies the position shown in full lines in Fig. 1, but the lever 12 occupies the clotted line position 12", opening the jaws 27 and 28. 'Jhus a cover 20 which has just "been re-applied to a pocket 19 can be moved circumferentially from between the jaws by the movement of the turret, and the extensions 30 of the cover of the next pocket on the turret will be brought between said jaws. By a movement of the crank arm 47 from the dotted position 47" vo the full line position, the lever 12 is moved to its full line position and the jaws 27 and 28 are closed on the extensions 30 of the cover. In the closed position of the jaws 27 and 28, the lever 12, arm 14 and pocket cover 20 are looked together as a unit, and by movement of tne arm 47 to the dotted position 47*, this unit is turned into its vertical position indicated by the dotted outlines 3.2*, 14*, 20*, opening the pocket 19 for the removal of a shaped bunch and the insertion of a new bunch. The removal of the shaped bunch may be effected by em ejecting device of known form, including ejecting rods movable upwardly through openings 11a and 19a in the turret 11 and pocket 19» and raising the bunch to a suitable transfer device. The loading of the open pocket with a new bunch is effected by the operation of the arm 16, lever 57 and loading pocket 51 in the manner above described, while the pocket cover is held in the vertical position 20* thereof. When the pocket 19 has thus been loaded, the parts 12, 14 and 20 are returned to their full line positions, replacing the cover on the pocket 19, by a movement of the crank arm 47 from its dotted position 47' to its full line position. A lug 36 on the hub of arm 14 comes to rest against an adjustable screw 37 on the support 8, thus determining the position of the 41.5 04 V cover 20. A further motion of the crank arm 47 to the posi¬ tion 47", causes the lever 12 to again move relatively to the arm 14 into its dotted position 12", thereby opening the jaws 27, 28 to release the cover. When the jaws have heen opened, the turret is again advanced one step, and the series of operations ahove descrihed is repeated. During its removal and replacement,- each cover is kept properly circumferentially and axially aligned by the means above described. In the preferred form of the invention, each of the pockets 19 carried by the turret 11 is provided with a spring pressed latch 38, adapted to extend through a slot in the cover, and which is movable axially relatively to the pocket, into cover locking engagement with the outer or top surface of the corresponding cover 20, by means of spring 33, as shown in dotted lines in Figure 1, thereby holding the cover firmly in place as the turret revolves. Each latch holds the cover firmly secured to the turret from the time the cover is placed in shaping position with respect to a bunch located in the pocket, until the pocket again arrives at the top of the tur¬ ret for unloading. In order to release each latch 38 at the unloading position, means carried by the cover manipulating arm 14 may be used. Each of the pockets 19, which carries the cover latching mechanism, is removably mounted on turret and hence can be readily replaced if worn or broken, or pockets of different size and shape can be substituted. In the form shown in Figures 1 and 2, the gripper jaw 27 is pro¬ vided with a lateral extension 63 arranged when the jaw is closed to engage with the top of the latch 38, thereby moving the latter into the full line position shown to disengage the cover and permit removal thereof. An inclined upper surface on the latch ensures the entry of the latch into the slot in the cover when the latter is replaced. The latch moves into cover engaging position as the jaw 27 is opened after the replace¬ ment of the cover. 415C&7 Another satisfactory device for clamping a cover on the corresponding pocket 19 for travel with the turret 11 during the Tmnch shaping operation, consists in the provision of a transverse bore at each end of the cover, as shown in Figure 4. Small halls 65 inserted in each bore are pressed outwardly by springs 66 to engage notches 67 formed in the inner side walls of the pocket to lock the cover resiliently in position on tne pocket. After insertion of the balls the ends of each bore in the cover are peened over just enough to allow the balls to protrude a sufficient distance, but to prevent them from falling out when the cover is removed. The up-motion of the arm 14 in removing the cover will pull the balls 65 out of engagement with &he grooves 67, and its down- motion in replacing the cover will push the balls back into place in the grooves, and the pressure of the spring 66 will hold the cover tight during the rotation of the turret. In the modification shown in Figure 5, the new toggle lever arrangement above described is combined with roller path¬ ways for holding the covers 20 in position on the pockets 19 during the rotation of the turret. The arrangement of the shaft 13, crank arm 47, arm 14, lever 12, and levers 25 and 26 provided with jaws 27 and 28, is the same as that above described, excepting that the jaws 27 and 8 are provided with integral projections 34 adapted to engage in the grooves of the dovetailed extensions 30 of the covers, instead of the tapered pins 34 above mentioned. The covers 20 are provided at the ends thereof with rollers 22 adapted as a replaced cover is moved forwardly with tne turret 11, to enter into annular pathways 23 mounted upon rods 24 supported by the supports 8 and 9. The pathways 23 encircle all but the top portion of the turret 11, the gap being just wide enough to allow the cover to be removed from the top pocket. In the modification shown in Figure 6, the covers are provided with rollers 22 adapted to travel in annular pathways 23 in the same manner as described with reference to Pig. 5, The cover removing arm 14 is however substantially of channel shape in cross-section, and has mounted within the channel a slide har 40 attached by a pin 53 tc/a lever 41 affixed to the shaft 13 which receives rocking motion from the crank arm 47. The slide bar 40 is held within the channel of the arm 14 by strips 42 extending across and secured to said arm. The arm 14, which is loose on the snaft 13, is formed with transverse pathways 46 into which enter a pair of rollers 68 carried by lugs 69 and 70 on each pocket cover 20, when said cover is moved into the unloading position at the top of the turret» at which time the arm occupies the position shown. The slide bar 40 has downwardly projecting fingers 43 adapted to engage in slots 44 formed in the lugs 69 and 70 of the cover 20, when the bar is moved to the left from the position shown. A compression spring or springs is or are interposed between the lever 41 and the ana 14. With a cover 20 engaged with the arm 14 as shown, an upward movement of the crank arm 47 moves tne bar 40 to the left to engage the fingers 43 witn the slots 44» the spring holding the arm 14 against movement. Such engagement limits the possible relative movement between the bar 40 and the arm 14 and thereafter the arm 14 is swung upwardly to remove the cover from the pocket 19. After the shaped bunch has been removed and a new bunch inserted in the pocket 19, the crank arm 47 and the arms 41 and 14 are moved downwardly to restore the cover, and when the lug 36 of arm 14 comes to rest against the stop screw 37, positioning the cover on the Q pocket 19, the further motion of crank 47 compresses the spring 45 and moves the tar 40 to the right along the arm 14, causing the fingers 43 to disengage from tne slots 44. As the turret 11 then advances another step, the rollers 68 of the reapplied cover leave the pathways 46 of arm 14, and the rollers 22 thereof, carried by the lugs 69 and 70, enter the annular pathways 23, which hold the cover in place for one revolution of the turret. This turret movement also engages the next cover with the arm 14, as shown, and the operations above described are repeated. A.kJu.Jh / 1.
