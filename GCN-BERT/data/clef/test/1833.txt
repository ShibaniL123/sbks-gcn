BENZAMIDE DERIVATIVES FOR INHIBITING THE ACTIVITY OF ABL1, ABL2 AND BCR-ABL1 CROSS-REFERENCED TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/647,187 filed on 15 May, 2012 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/789,145 filed on 15 March 2013, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to compounds capable of inhibiting the tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity of the Abelson protein (ABL1), the Abelson-related protein (ABL2) and related chimeric proteins, in particular BCR-ABL1. The invention further provides a process for the preparation of compounds of the invention, pharmaceutical preparations comprising such compounds and methods of using such compounds in the treatment of cancers. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] The tyrosine kinase activity of the ABL1 protein is normally tightly regulated, with the TV-terminal cap region of the SH3 domain playing an important role. One regulatory mechanism involves the TV-terminal cap glycine-2 residue being myristoylated and then interacting with a myristate binding site within the SHI catalytic domain. A hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), formed by the t(9,22) reciprocal chromosome translocation in a haematopoietic stem cell. This chromosome carries the BCR-ABL1 oncogene which encodes the chimeric BCR-ABL1 protein, that lacks the TV-terminal cap and has a constitutively active tyrosine kinase domain. [0004] Although drugs that inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL1 via an ΑΤΡcompetitive mechanism, such as Gleevec® / Glivec® (imatinib), Tasigna® (nilotinib) and Sprycel® (dasatinib), are effective in the treatment of CML, some patients relapse due to the emergence of drug-resistant clones, in which mutations in the SHI domain compromise inhibitor binding. Although Tasigna® and Sprycel® maintain efficacy towards many Gleevec-resistant mutant forms of BCR-ABL1, the mutation in which the threonine-315 residue is replaced by an isoleucine (T315I) remains insensitive to all three drugs and can result in CML patients developing resistance to therapy. Therefore, inhibiting BCR-ABL1 mutations, such as T315I, remains an unmet medical need. In addition to CML, BCR-ABL1 fusion proteins are causative in a percentage of acute lymphocytic leukemias, and drugs targeting ABL kinase activity also have utility in this indication. [0005] Agents targeting the myristoyl binding site (so-called allosteric inhibitors) have potential for the treatment of BCR-ABL1 disorders (J. Zhang, F. J. Adrian, W. Jahnke, S. W. Cowan-Jacob, A. G. Li, R. Ε. Iacob4, Τ. Sim, J. Powers, C. Dierks, F. Sun, G.-R. Guo, Q. Ding, Β. Okram, Υ. Choi, A. Wojciechowski, X. Deng, G. Liu, G. Fendrich, A. Strauss, Ν. Vajpai, S. Grzesiek, Τ. Tuntland, Υ. Liu, Β. Bursulaya, Μ. Azam, Ρ. W. Manley, J. R. Engen, G. Q. Daley, Μ. Warmuth., Ν. S. Gray. Targeting Bcr-Abl by combining allosteric with ATP-binding-site inhibitors. Nature 2010;463:501-6). To prevent the emergence of drug resistance from ATP inhibitor and/or allosteric inhibitor use, a combination treatment using both types of inhibitor can be developed for the treatment of BCR-ABL1 related disorders. In particular, the need exists for small molecules, or combinations thereof, that inhibit the activity of BCR-ABL 1 and BCR-ABL 1 mutations via the ATP binding site, the myristoyl binding site or a combination of both sites. [0006] Further, compounds of the invention as inhibitors of ABL1 kinase activity have the potential to be used as therapies for the treatment of metastatic invasive carcinomas and viral infections such as pox and Ebola viruses. [0007] The compounds from the present invention also have the potential to treat or prevent diseases or disorders associated with abnormally activated kinase activity of wild-type Abl, including non-malignant diseases or disorders, such as CNS diseases in particular neurodegenerative diseases (for example Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s diseases), motoneuroneuron diseases (amyotophic lateral sclerosis), muscular dystrophies, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (diabetes and pulmonary fibrosis), viral infections, prion diseases.

Definitions [0026] The general terms used hereinbefore and hereinafter preferably have within the context of this disclosure the following meanings, unless otherwise indicated, where more general terms whereever used may, independently of each other, be replaced by more specific definitions or remain, thus defining more detailed embodiments of the invention: [0027] “Alkyl” refers to a fully saturated branched or unbranched hydrocarbon moiety having up to 20 carbon atoms. Unless otherwise provided, alkyl refers to hydrocarbon moieties having 1 to 7 carbon atoms (Ci_7alkyl), or 1 to 4 carbon atoms (Ci^alkyl). Representative examples of alkyl include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, «-propyl, /.vopropyl, «-butyl, secbutyl, iso-butyl, /er/-butyl, /7-pcntyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, /7-hcxyl, 3-methylhexyl, 2,2-dimethylpentyl, 2,3-dimethylpentyl, /7-hcptyl, /7-octyl, /7-nonyl, /7-dccyl and the like. A substituted alkyl is an alkyl group containing one or more, such as one, two or three substituents selected from halogen, hydroxy or alkoxy groups. Halo-substituted-alkyl and halo-substituted-alkoxy, can be either straight-chained or branched and includes, methoxy, ethoxy, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, and the like. [0028] “Aryl” means a monocyclic or fused bicyclic aromatic ring assembly containing six to ten ring carbon atoms. For example, aryl may be phenyl or naphthyl, preferably phenyl. “Arylene” means a divalent radical derived from an aryl group. [0029] “BCR-ABL1” refers to a fusion protein created from the TV-terminal exons of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene and the major C-terminal part (exons 2-11) of the Abelson (ABL1) gene. The most common fusion transcripts encode for a 210-kDa protein (ρ210 BCR-ABL1), although rarer tanscripts encode a 190-kDa protein (ρ190 BCR-ABL1) and a 230-kDa protein (ρ230 BCR-ABL1). The ABL1 sequences of these proteins contains an ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain which is tightly regulated in the wild-type protein, but constitutively activated in the BCR-ABL1 fusion proteins. This deregulated tyrosine kinase interacts with multiple cellular signalling pathways leading to transformation and deregulated proliferation of the cells. [0030] “BCR-ABL1 mutants” refers to the numerous single site mutations in BCR-ABL1 including: Glu255->Lysine, Glu255->Valine, Thr315-Tsoleucine, Met244->Val, Phe317->Leu, Leu248->Val, Met343^Thr, Gly250^Ala, Met351^Thr, Gly250-»Glu, Glu355-»Gly, Gln252^His, Phe358^Ala, Gln252^Arg, Phe359->Val, Tyr253^His, Val379^Ile, Tyr253->Phe, Phe382^Leu, Glu255^Lys, Leu387^Met, Glu255^Val, His396^Pro, Phe311^Ile, His396^Arg, Phe311^Leu, Ser417^Tyr, Thr315^Ile, Glu459^Lys and Phe486^Ser. [0031] Compounds of the invention are sensitive to substitution on the R3 / R4 substituted ring at the position that is ortho to the point of attachment of the NHC(O) group. Compare, for example, the following compounds of formula (I). The IC50 of Example 35 is <3nM compared to a chloro or dichloro substitution whith an IC50 of 850ηΜ and Μ0μΜ, respectively: [0032] “Heteroaryl” is as defined for aryl above where one or more of the ring members is a heteroatom. For example Cs-ioheteroaryl is a minimum of 5 members as indicated by the carbon atoms but that these carbon atoms can be replaced by a heteroatom. Consequently, C5_ loheteroaryl includes pyridyl, indolyl, indazolyl, quinoxalinyl, quinolinyl, benzofuranyl, benzopyranyl, benzothiopyranyl, benzo[l,3]dioxole, imidazolyl, benzo-imidazolyl, pyrimidinyl, furanyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyrazolyl, thienyl, etc. [0033] “Cycloalkyl” means a saturated or partially unsaturated, monocyclic, fused bicyclic or bridged polycyclic ring assembly containing the number of ring atoms indicated. For example, C3_iocycloalkyl includes cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, etc. [0034] “Heterocycloalkyl” means cycloalkyl, as defined in this application, provided that one or more of the ring carbons indicated, are replaced by a moiety selected from -0-, -Ν=, -NR-, -C(O)-, -S-, -S(O) - or -S(0)2-, wherein R is hydrogen, Ci^alkyl or a nitrogen protecting group. For example, Cvshctcrocycloalkyl as used in this application to describe compounds of the invention includes morpholino, pyrrolidinyl, pyrrolidinyl-2-one, piperazinyl, piperidinyl, piperidinylone, l,4-dioxa-8-aza-spiro[4.5]dec-8-yl, thiomorpholino, sulfanomorpholino, sulfonomorpholino, etc. [0035] “Halogen” (or halo) preferably represents chloro or fluoro, but may also be bromo or iodo. [0036] Compounds of formula (I) may have different isomeric forms. For example, any asymmetric carbon atom may be present in the (R)-, (S)- or (R,S)-configuration, preferably in the (R)- or (S)-configuration. Substituents at a double bond or especially a ring may be present in cis(= Ζ-) or trans (= Ε-) form. The compounds may thus be present as mixtures of isomers or preferably as pure isomers, preferably as pure diastereomers or pure enantiomers. [0037] Where the plural form (e.g. compounds, salts) is used, this includes the singular (e.g. a single compound, a single salt). “A compound” does not exclude that (e.g. in a pharmaceutical formulation) more than one compound of the formula (I) (or a salt thereof) is present, the “a” merely representing the indefinite article. “A” can thus preferably be read as “one or more”, less preferably alternatively as “one”. [0038] Wherever a compound or compounds of the formula (I) are mentioned, this is further also intended to include N-oxides of such compounds and/or tautomers thereof. [0039] The term ’’and/or an N-oxide thereof, a tautomer thereof and/or a (preferably pharmaceutically acceptable) salt thereof’ especially means that a compound of the formula (I) may be present as such or in mixture with its N-oxide, as tautomer (e.g. due to keto-enol, lactamlactim, amide-imidic acid or enamine-imine tautomerism) or in (e.g. equivalency reaction caused) mixture with its tautomer, or as a salt of the compound of the formula (I) and/or any of these forms or mixtures of two or more of such forms. [0040] The present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of the invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. An isotopic variation of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that may be incorporated into the compounds of the invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include, but are not limited to, isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen such as as 2H (D or deuterium), 3H, nC, 13C, 14C, 15N, 170,180,35S, 18F, 36C1 and 123I. Certain isotopic variations of the compounds of the invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as 3H or 14C is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. In particular examples, 3H and 14C isotopes may be used for their ease of preparation and detectability. In other examples, substitution with isotopes such as 2H may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, such as increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. Isotopic variations of the compounds of the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can generally be prepared by conventional procedures using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents. [0041] For example, a compound of the invention can incorporate deuterium on the pyrrolidinyl ring as shown: [0042] This deuterated form is less prone to metabolic transformation (left, above) compared with the none deutorated form (right, above).

Pharmacology and Utility [0089] On the basis of the inhibitory studies described in the “Assay” section below, a compound of formula (I) according to the invention shows therapeutic efficacy especially against disorders dependent on BCR-ABL1 activity. In particular, compounds of the present invention inhibit the allosteric or myristoyl binding site of BCR-ABL1 (including wild-type BCR-ABL1 and/or mutations thereof). [0090] Combining an ATP-competitive inhibitor of BCR-ABL1 with an allosteric inhibitor of BCR-ABL1 delays acquired resistance in BCR-ABL1+KCL-22 cells, in vitro. Surprisingly, BCR-ABL1+KCL-22 cells treated every 3-4 days with a compound of the invention showed an acquired resistance after approximately 28 days whereas these same cells treated every 3-4 days with nilotinib or dasatinib showed an acquired resistance after only 18-21 days. Even more surprisingly, when BCR-ABL1+KCL-22 cells were treated every 3-4 days with a combination of a compound of the invention and either nilotinib or dasatinib, no acquired resistance was observed in at least the first 60 days. Therefore, myristoyl-binding site compounds of the present invention, in combination with BCR-ABL1 inhibitors that bind to the ATP binding site are especially important for the treatment of proliferative diseases involving upregulation of ABL1 kinase activity, as in the case of BCR-ABL1 fusion proteins in CML and subsets of other haematological malignancies such as ALL and AML. [0091] Carcinoma cells utilize invapodia to degrade the extra cellular matrix during tumor invasion and metastasis. ABL kinase activity is required for Src-induced invapodia formation, regulating distinct stages of invapodia assembly and function. The compounds of the invention, therefore, as inhibitors of ABL, have the potential to be used as therapies for the treatment of metastatic invasive carcinomas. [0092] An allosteric inhibitor of c-ABL kinase can be used to treat brain cancers: including Glioblastoma which is the most common & most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in which the expression of c-ABL is immunohistochemically detectable in a subset of patients (Haberler C, Gelpi Ε, Marosi C, Rossler Κ, Bimer Ρ, Budka Η, Hainfellner JA. Immunohistochemical analysis of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha, -beta, c-kit, c-abl, and arg proteins in glioblastoma: possible implications for patient selection for imatinib mesylate therapy. J Neurooncol. 2006 Jan;76(2): 105-9). However, clinical trials with Gleevec® failed in patients with glioblastoma (Reardon DA, Dresemann G, Taillibert S, Campone Μ, van den Bent Μ, Clement Ρ, Blomquist Ε, Gordower L, Schultz Η, Raizer J, Hau Ρ, Easaw J, Gil Μ, Τοηη J, Gijtenbeek A, Schlegel U, Bergstrom Ρ, Green S, Weir A, Nikolova Ζ. Multicentre phase II studies evaluating imatinib plus hydroxyurea in patients with progressive glioblastoma. Br J Cancer. 2009 Dec 15;101(12): 1995-2004; Razis Ε, Selviaridis Ρ, Labropoulos S, Norris JL, Zhu MJ, Song DD, Kalebic Τ, Torrens Μ, Kalogera-Fountzila A, Karkavelas G, Karanastasi S, Fletcher JA, Fountzilas G. Phase II study of neoadjuvant imatinib in glioblastoma: evaluation of clinical and molecular effects of the treatment. Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Oct 1 ; 15(19):6258-66; Dresemann G. Imatinib and hydroxyurea in pretreated progressive glioblastoma multiforme: a patient series. Ann Oncol. 2005 Oct; 16(10): 1702-8), possibly because of the poor brain intratumoral exposure of the drug and in the absence of disturbed blood-brain barrier (Holdhoff et al, J Neurooncol. 2010;97(2):241-5). The transport of Gleevec® across the blood-brain barrier is in fact shown in preclinical studies to be limited by active efflux transporters such as Ρglycoprotein. This is also the case for Dasatinib (Chen Υ, Agarwal S, Shaik ΝΜ, Chen C, Υang Ζ, Elmquist WF. P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein influence brain distribution of dasatinib. J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2009 Sep;330(3):956-63). Irradiation is known to enhance the blood-brain barrier opening. In mouse models, glioblastoma multiforme response to Gleevec® correlated with an increase in tumor growth delay and survival when Gleevec® was administered in conjunction with daily irradiation (Geng L, Shinohara ET, Kim D, Tan J, Osusky Κ, Shyr Υ, Hallahan DE. STI571 (Gleevec) improves tumor growth delay and survival in irradiated mouse models of glioblastoma. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Jan 1 ;64(1):263-71). Therefore a new c-Abl inhibitor with high brain exposure represents a solid therapeutic approach for glioblastoma and other brain cancers. [0093] CNS-CML: In some CML patients treated with Gleevec®, CNS Blast crisis and failure have been reported and can be explained by the poor brain exposure of Gleevec®. (Kim HJ, Jung CW, Kim Κ, Ahn JS, Kim WS, Park Κ, Κο ΥΗ, Kang WK, Park Κ. Isolated blast crisis in CNS in a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia maintaining major cytogenetic response after imatinib. J Clin Oncol. 2006 Aug 20;24(24):4028-9; RadhikaN, Minakshi Μ, Rajesh Μ, Manas BR, Deepak Kumar M.Central nervous system blast crisis in chronic myeloid leukemia on imatinib mesylate therapy: report of two cases. Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2011 Mar;27(l):51-4). In fact, in CML patients, Gleevec®’s concentration is in fact much lower (-100 fold) in the CNS than in plasma (Leis JF, Stepan DE, Curtin ΡΤ, Ford JM, Peng Β, Schubach S, Druker BJ, Maziarz RT. Central nervous system failure in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia lymphoid blast crisis and Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with imatinib (STI-571). Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Apr;45(4):695-8). Therefore, c-ABL inhibitors from the present invention which show a high brain exposure represent a valid approach for development of therapies against CML including CNS-CML. [0094] Compounds of the invention can be useful in the treatment of viruses. For example, viral infections can be mediated by ABL1 kinase activity, as in the case of pox-viruses and the Ebola virus. Gleevec® and Tasigna® have been shown to stop the release of Ebola viral particles from infected cells, in vitro (Kalman, Daniel; Bornmann, William Gerard, Methods of use of non-ATP competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors to treat pathogenic infection, PCT Int. Appl. 2007, WO 2007002441; Garcia Mayra; Cooper Arik; Shi Wei; Bornmann William; Carrion Ricardo; Kalman Daniel; Nabel Gary J. Productive Replication of Ebola Virus Is Regulated by the c-ABLl Tyrosine Kinase. Science translational medicine 2012;4:123ra24). Compounds of the present invention that inhibit c-ABL kinase, therefore, can be expected to reduce the pathogen’s ability to replicate. [0095] Compounds of the invention can also be useful in the treatment of neural degeneration. While native c-ABL tyrosine kinase remains relatively quiescent in healthy adult brain, it can be activated in the brain of patients with CNS diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Picks disease, Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) and other degenerative, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and ageing. [0096] Parkinson’s disease is the second most prevalent chronic neurodegenerative disease with the most common familial autosomal-recessive form being caused by mutations in the Ε3 ubiquitin ligase, parkin. Recent studies showed that activated c-ABL was found in the striatum of patients with sporadic Parkinson’s disease. Concomitantly, parkin was tyrosine-phosphorylated, causing loss of its ubiquitin ligase and cytoprotective activities as indicated by the accumulation of parkin substrates (Κο HS, Lee Υ, Shin JH, Karuppagounder SS, Gadad BS, Koleske AJ, Pletnikova O, Troncoso JC, Dawson VL, Dawson ΤΜ. Phosphorylation by the c-Abl protein tyrosine kinase inhibits parkin's ubiquitination and protective function. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Sep 21;107(38): 16691-6; Imam SZ, Zhou Q, Yamamoto A, Valente AJ, Ali SF, Bains Μ, Roberts JL, Kahle PJ, Clark RA, Li S. Novel regulation of parkin function through c-Ablmediated tyrosine phosphorylation: implications for Parkinson's disease. J Neurosci. 2011 Jan 5;31(1): 157-63). These two studies also showed that in cell or animal models of Parkinson’s disease, pharmacological inhibition of c-ABL kinase or genetic ABL knockdown prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of parkin and restored its Ε3 ligase activity and cytoprotective function both in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that c-ABL-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of parkin is a major post-translational modification that leads to loss of parkin function and disease progression in sporadic PD. Therefore, the ability of compounds of the invention to inhibit the myristate-binding site of ABL 1, can be expected to offer new therapeutic opportunities for blocking the progression of Parkinson’s disease. [0097] Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by two main hallmarks: extracellular deposits of the neurotoxic amyloid-p which leads to amyloid plaque development, and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau which contributes to the development of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). [0098] Amyloid-p level is reduced following intrathecal treatment with Gleevec® in the brain of wild-type guinea-pigs and in cell models (Netzer WJ, Dou F, Cai D, Veach D, Jean S, Li Υ, Bommann WG, Clarkson Β, Xu Η, Greengard Ρ. Gleevec inhibits beta-amyloid production but not Notch cleavage. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2003 Oct 14;100(21): 12444-9). The same group proposed that Gleevec® achieves its amyloid-p-lowcring effect via a new mechanism preventing GSAP interaction with the gamma-secretase substrate, APP-CTF (He G, Luo W, Li Ρ, Remmers C, Netzer WJ, Hendrick J, Bettayeb Κ, Flajolet Μ, Gorelick F, Wennogle LP, Greengard Ρ. Gamma-secretase activating protein is a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease. Nature. 2010 Sep 2;467(7311):95-8). In this study, Gleevec®’s effect to inhibit GSAP/APP-CTF wass only seen at micromolar concentrations. Another group showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of ΑΡΡ (i.e. Tyr682) regulates the amyloidogenic ΑΡΡ processing accelerating amyloid-fl formation in vivo (Barbagallo ΑΡ, Weldon R, Tamayev R, Zhou D, Giliberto L, Foreman O, D'Adamio L. Tyr(682) in the intracellular domain of ΑΡΡ regulates amyloidogenic ΑΡΡ processing in vivo. PLoS One. 2010 Nov 16;5(11):℮15503). Other studies showed that ΑΡΡ is tyrosine phosphorylated in cells expressing a constitutively active form of the ABL oncogene (Zambrano Ν, Bruni Ρ, Minopoli G, Mosca R, Molino D, Russo C, Schettini G, Sudol Μ, Russo Τ. The beta-amyloid precursor protein ΑΡΡ is tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells expressing a constitutively active form of the Abl protoncogene. J Biol Chem. 2001 Jun 8;276(23): 19787-92). These data together suggest a c-ABL-dependent amyloidogenic ΑΡΡ processing for the formation of the toxic amyloid-fl peptide and subsequent amyloid plaques. Therefore a c-ABL inhibitor would be expected to lower amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimmer’s patients. [0099] Tau has been shown to be phosphorylated by e-Abl kinase at tyrosines 18, 197, 310, and 394 in cell models, and tau ρΥ394 has been shown to be present in the lesions NFTs in the brain of AD patients. [00100] c-ABL is activated in the brain of patients with sporadic Alzheimer’s disease as shown by its phosphorylation either at Υ412, an indicator of activation, which co-localizes granulovacuolar degeneration, or at Τ735 which co-loealized with the typical lesions, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillar}" tangles (NFTs) in addition to GVD. Amyloid-ft and oxidative stress activate c-ABL kinase in neuronal cultures and intracerebral injection of fibrillar amyloid peptide leads to increased expression of c-ABL and a downstream effector ρ73. Transgenic mice (APP/Swe mouse model of AD), showed higher levels of c-ABL in their brain and, when these mice wrere treated with the c-ABL inhibitor Gleevec®, tau phosphorylation was decreased in their brains. A transgenic mouse model expressing constitutive!}" active c-ABL in forebrain neurons exhibited neuronal loss, severe neuroinflammation, and tyrosine phosphorylation of tau in the brain (For review, see Schlatterer SD, Acker CM, Davies Ρ. c-Abl in neurodegenerative disease. J Mol Neurosci. 2011 Νον;45(3):445-52). [00101] Based on all these results, evidence exists for a role for c-ABL kinase in Alzheimer’s pathogenesis for development of both lesions, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. [00102] Further, activated c-ABL is also present in other tauopathies besides sporadic Alzheimer’s including in the brain of patients with frontotemporal dementia with Ν279Κ and P301L mutations, Pick’s disease, and Guam Parkinson-dementia (Schlatterer SD, Acker CM, Davies Ρ. c-Abl in neurodegenerative disease. J Mol Neurosci. 2011 Νον;45(3):445-52). [00103] Therefore, compounds of the present invention, by inhibiting c-ABL in the CNS, represent a valid approach for development of therapies against Alzheimer’s disease, as well as other [l-amyloidoscs, such as vascular dementia and other tauopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia and picks disease. [00104] Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a fatal autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of free cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in the endosomallysosomal system, and by a progressive neuronal death in particular of cerebellar Purkinje neurons. In a mouse model of NPC, the proapoptotic c-ABL, the downstream target as well as ρ73 target genes are expressed in the cerebellums. Inhibition of c-ABL with Gleevec® prevented from loss of Purkinje neurons, improved neurological symptoms, and increased the survival. This prosurvival effect of Gleevec® correlated with reduced mRNA levels of ρ73 proapoptotic target genes (Alvarez AR, Klein A, Castro J, Cancino GI, Amigo J, Mosqueira Μ, Vargas LM, Yevenes LF, Bronfman FC, Zanlungo S. Imatinib therapy blocks cerebellar apoptosis and improves neurological symptoms in a mouse model ofNiemann-Pick type C disease. FASEB J. 2008 Oct;22(10):3617-27). Therefore, compounds of the present invention, by inhibiting c-ABL kinase, represent a valid approach for the development of therapies against diseases caused by the proapoptotic c-ABL/p73 pathway, such as NPC. [00105] In prion disease models, Gleevec® showed beneficial effects: It delayed prion neuroinvasion by inhibiting prion propagation from the periphery to the CNS (Yun SW, Ertmer A, Flechsig Ε, Gilch S, Riederer Ρ, Gerlach Μ, Schatzl ΗΜ, Klein ΜΑ. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate delays prion neuroinvasion by inhibiting prion propagation in the periphery. J Neurovirol. 2007 Aug;13(4):328-37). Gleevec® and ABL deficiency induced cellular clearance of PrPSc in prion-infected cells (Ertmer A, Gilch S, Yun SW, Flechsig Ε, Klebl Β, Stein-Gerlach Μ, Klein ΜΑ, Schatzl ΗΜ. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 induces cellular clearance of PrPSc in prion-infected cells. J Biol Chem. 2004 Oct 1;279(40):41918-27). Therefore, novel c-Abl inhibitors from the present invention also represent a valid therapeutic approach for the treatment of prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. [00106] X-linked recessive Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations of emerin, a nuclear-membrane protein with roles in nuclear architecture, gene regulation and signaling. A recent study has shown that emerin is tyrosine-phosphorylated directly by c-ABL in cell models, and that the phosphorylation status of emerin changes emerin binding to other proteins such as BAF. This, in turn, may explain the mislocalization of mutant emerin from nuclear to cytosolic compartments and consequently changes in downstream effector and signal integrator for signaling pathway(s) at the nuclear envelope (Tifft ΚΕ, Bradbury ΚΑ, Wilson KL. Tyrosine phosphorylation of nuclear-membrane protein emerin by Src, Abl and other kinases. J Cell Sci. 2009 Oct 15;122(Pt 20):3780-90). Changes in emerin-lamin interactions during both mitosis and interphase are of relevance for the pathology of muscular dystrophies. In addition, results from another study demonstrate that Gleevec® attenuates skeletal muscle dystrophy in mdx mice (Huang Ρ, Zhao XS, Fields Μ, Ransohoff RM, Zhou L. Imatinib attenuates skeletal muscle dystrophy in mdx mice. FASEB J. 2009 Aug;23(8):2539-48). [00107] Therefore, novel c-ABL inhibitors from the present invention also represent therapeutic approaches for treatment of skeletal and muscular dystrophies. [00108] Furthermore, c-ABL kinase plays a role in inflammation and oxidative stress, two mechanisms that are implicated in a variety of human diseases ranging from acute CNS diseases, such as stroke and traumatic brain or spinal cord injuries, chronic CNS diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and motoneuron diseases, to non-CNS inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes, pulmonary fibrosis. [00109] For example, Gleevec® prevents fibrosis in different preclinical models of systemic sclerosis and induces regression of established fibrosis (Akhmetshina A, Venalis Ρ, Dees C, Busch Ν, Zwerina J, Schett G, Distler O, Distler JH. Treatment with imatinib prevents fibrosis in different preclinical models of systemic sclerosis and induces regression of established fibrosis. Arthritis Rheum. 2009 Jan;60(l):219-24) and it shows antifibrotic effects in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice (Αοηο Υ, Nishioka Υ, Inayama Μ, Ugai Μ, Kishi J, Uehara Η, Izumi Κ, Sone S. Imatinib as a novel antifibrotic agent in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2005 Jun 1; 171(11): 1279-85). Another study showed that both imatinib and nilotinib attenuated bleomycin-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis in mice (Rhee CK, Lee SH, Yoon ΗΚ, Kim SC, Lee SY, Kwon SS, Kim ΥΚ, Kim ΚΗ, Kim TJ, Kim JW. Effect of nilotinib on bleomycin-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Respiration. 2011;82(3):273-87). Although in these studies the authors were focusing on the implication the mechanism related to PDGFRs, of interest, in the study by Rhee et al. (Respiration. 2011;82(3):273-87), nilotinib which is a more potent c-ABL inhibitor than imatinib showed superior therapeutic antifibrotic effects, thus supporting the therapeutic applicability of c-ABL inhibitors for treatment of human diseases with pulmonary inflammation. In another study, exposure of mice to hyperoxia increased c-Abl activation which is required for dynamin 2 phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species production and pulmonary leak (Singleton PA, Pendyala S, Gorshkova IA, Mambetsariev Ν, Moitra J, Garcia JG, Natarajan V. Dynamin 2 and c-Abl are novel regulators of hyperoxia-mediated NADPH oxidase activation and reactive oxygen species production in caveolin-enriched microdomains of the endothelium. J Biol Chem. 2009 Dec 11;284(50):34964-75). [00110] Therefore, these data indicate that new c-ABL inhibitors from the present invention have therapeutic applicability for treatment of human diseases with pulmonary inflammation. [00111] c-ABL activation by insulin, via a modification of FAK response, may play an important role in directing mitogenic versus metabolic insulin receptor signaling (Genua Μ, Pandini G, Cassarino MF, Messina RL, Frasca F. c-Abl and insulin receptor signalling. Vitam Horm. 2009;80:77-105). c-Abl inhibitors such as Gleevec® have been shown to reverse type 1 diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice (Louvet C, Szot GL, Lang J, Lee MR, Martinier Ν, Bollag G, Zhu S, Weiss A, Bluestone JA. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors reverse type 1 diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2008 Dec 2; 105(48): 18895-900). Amelioration of diabetes by Gleevec® was mimicked by siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-ABL mRNA (Hagerkvist R, Sandler S, Mokhtari D, Welsh Ν. Amelioration of diabetes by imatinib mesylate (Gleevec): role of betacell NF-kappaB activation and anti-apoptotic preconditioning. FASEB J. 2007 Feb;21(2):618-28). [00112] Therefore, the new c-ABL inhibitors from the present invention have therapeutic applicability for treatment of human diabetes. [00113] A c-ABL inhibitor from the present invention can be used in combination with one or more of the existing treatment for the above diseases: for example a c-ABL inhibitor from the present invention can be used in combination with Levodopa or other L-DOPA-containing medicaments or a dopamine agonist for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease or in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor such as Exelon capsule or transdermal patch for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. [00114] In chronic myelogeous leukemia (CML), a reciprocal balanced chromosomal translocation in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) produces the BCR-ABL1 hybrid gene. The latter encodes the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. Whereas ABL encodes a tightly regulated protein tyrosine kinase, which plays a fundamental role in regulating cell proliferation, adherence and apoptosis, the BCR-ABL 1 fusion gene encodes as constitutively activated kinase. This activated kinase transforms HSCs to produce a phenotype exhibiting deregulated clonal proliferation, reduced capacity to adhere to the bone marrow stroma and a reduced apoptotic response to mutagenic stimuli, resulting in progressively more malignant transformations. The resuiting granulocytes fail to develop into mature lymphocytes and are released into the circulation, leading to a deficiency in the mature cells and increased susceptibility to infection. ΑΤΡcompetitive inhibitors of BCR-ABL1 have been demonstrated to prevent the kinase from activating mitogenic and anti-apoptotic pathways (for example, P-3 kinase and STAT5), leading to the death of the BCR-ABL1 phenotype cells and thereby providing an effective therapy against CML. The compounds of the invention, as BCR-ABL1 inhibitors, including mutants thereof, are thus especially appropriate for the therapy of diseases related to its over-expression, such as ALL or CML leukemias. [00115] Compounds of the invention have also been demonstrated to have anti-tumor activity, in vivo: The in vivo antitumor activity is tested, for example using leukemic cell lines such as Ba/F3-BCR-ABL1, KC-22, Κ-562, MEG-01, ΚΥΟ-1, LAMA-84, KU812, EM-2, CML-Tl, BV-173, or ALL-SIL. [00116] The present invention includes a method to treat cancer, comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition. [00117] A further embodiment comprises administering to the subject an additional therapeutic agent. [00118] In a further embodiment, the additional therapeutic agent is a different BCR-ABL1 inhibitor selected from imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, dosutinib, ponatinib and bafetinib. [00119] In another embodiment is a method to treat a condition mediated by BCR-ABL1, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition. [00120] In a further embodiment, the BCR-ABL1 contains one or more mutations (UJane F. Apperley. Part 1: Mechanism of resistance to imatinib in chronic myeloid leukaemia. Lancet Oncology 2007;8:1018). Examples of such mutations include V299L, T315I, F317I, F317L, Y253F, Υ253Η, Ε255Κ, E255V, F359C and F359V. [00121] In certain embodiments, the present invention relates to the aforementioned method, wherein said compound is administered parenterally. [00122] In certain embodiments, the present invention relates to the aforementioned method, wherein said compound is administered intramuscularly, intravenously, subcutaneously, orally, pulmonary, intrathecally, topically or intranasally. [00123] In certain embodiments, the present invention relates to the aforementioned method, wherein said compound is administered systemically. [00124] In certain embodiments, the present invention relates to the aforementioned method, wherein said patient is a mammal. [00125] In certain embodiments, the present invention relates to the aforementioned method, wherein said patient is a primate. [00126] In certain embodiments, the present invention relates to the aforementioned method, wherein said patient is a human. [00127] In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method of treating an ABL1/BCR-ABL1 -mediated disorder, comprising the step of: administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a chemothereutic agent in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of compound of formula (I) as defined in the Summary of the Invention. [00128] In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method of treating a ABLl/BCR-ABLl-mediated disorder, comprising the step of: administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a chemothereutic agent in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of compound of formula (I). Pharmaceutical Compositions [00129] In another aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions which comprise a therapeutically-effective amount of one or more of the compounds described above, formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (additives) and/or diluents. As described in detail below, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be specially formulated for administration in solid or liquid form, including those adapted for the following: (1) oral administration, for example, drenches (aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions), tablets, e.g., those targeted for buccal, sublingual, and systemic absorption, boluses, powders, granules, pastes for application to the tongue; (2) parenteral administration, for example, by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or epidural injection as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension, or sustainedrelease formulation; (3) topical application, for example, as a cream, ointment, or a controlledrelease patch or spray applied to the skin; (4) intravaginally or intrarectally, for example, as a pessary, cream or foam; (5) sublingually; (6) ocularly; (7) transdermally; (8) nasally; (9) pulmonary; or (10) intrathecally. [00130] The phrase "therapeutically-effective amount" as used herein means that amount of a compound, material, or composition comprising a compound of the present invention which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect in at least a sub-population of cells in an animal at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. [00131] The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. [00132] The phrase "pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier" as used herein means a pharmaceutically-acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, manufacturing aid (e.g., lubricant, talc magnesium, calcium or zinc stearate, or steric acid), or solvent encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting the subject compound from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogenfree water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer's solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) pH buffered solutions; (21) polyesters, polycarbonates and/or polyanhydrides; and (22) other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations. [00133] As set out above, certain embodiments of the present compounds may contain a basic functional group, such as amino or alkylamino, and are, thus, capable of forming pharmaceutically-acceptable salts with pharmaceutically-acceptable acids. The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable salts" in this respect, refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can be prepared in situ in the administration vehicle or the dosage form manufacturing process, or by separately reacting a purified compound of the invention in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed during subsequent purification. Representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate, acetate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, napthylate, mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate, and laurylsulphonate salts and the like. (See, for example, Berge et al. (1977) "Pharmaceutical Salts", J. Pharm. Sci. 66:1-19). [00134] The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the subject compounds include the conventional nontoxic salts or quaternary ammonium salts of the compounds, e.g., from non-toxic organic or inorganic acids. For example, such conventional nontoxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric, and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, palmitic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicyclic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isothionic, and the like. [00135] In other cases, the compounds of the present invention may contain one or more acidic functional groups and, thus, are capable of forming pharmaceutically-acceptable salts with pharmaceutically-acceptable bases. The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable salts" in these instances refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic base addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can likewise be prepared in situ in the administration vehicle or the dosage form manufacturing process, or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free acid form with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically-acceptable metal cation, with ammonia, or with a pharmaceutically-acceptable organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Representative alkali or alkaline earth salts include the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum salts and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine and the like. (See, for example, Berge et ah, supra) [00136] Wetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions. [00137] Examples of pharmaceutically-acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (ΒΗΑ), butylated hydroxytoluene (ΒΗΤ), lecithin, propyl gallate, alphatocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. [00138] Formulations of the present invention include those suitable for oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal and/or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated, the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred per cent, this amount will range from about 0.1 per cent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 per cent to about 70 per cent, most preferably from about 10 percent to about 30 percent. [00139] In certain embodiments, a formulation of the present invention comprises an excipient selected from the group consisting of cyclodextrins, celluloses, liposomes, micelle forming agents, e.g., bile acids, and polymeric carriers, e.g., polyesters and polyanhydrides; and a compound of the present invention. In certain embodiments, an aforementioned formulation renders orally bioavailable a compound of the present invention. [00140] Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound of the present invention with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. [00141] Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution, suspension or solid dispersion in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the present invention as an active ingredient. A compound of the present invention may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste. [00142] In solid dosage forms of the invention for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules, trouches and the like), the active ingredient is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; (2) binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; (3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; (5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds and surfactants, such as poloxamer and sodium lauryl sulfate; (7) wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate, and non-ionic surfactants; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; (9) lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, zinc stearate, sodium stearate, stearic acid, and mixtures thereof; (10) coloring agents; and (11) controlled release agents such as crospovidone or ethyl cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-shelled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. [00143] A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. [00144] The tablets, and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be formulated for rapid release, e.g., freeze-dried. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients. [00145] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds of the invention include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. [00146] Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents. [00147] Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof. [00148] Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more compounds of the invention with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, and which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. [00149] Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. [00150] Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required. [00151] The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof. [00152] Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to a compound of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane. [00153] Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound of the present invention to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel. [00154] Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. [00155] Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain sugars, alcohols, antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents. [00156] Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. [00157] These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms upon the subject compounds may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. [00158] In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. [00159] Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue. [00160] When the compounds of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1 to 99% (more preferably, 10 to 30%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. [00161] The preparations of the present invention may be given orally, parenterally, topically, or rectally. They are of course given in forms suitable for each administration route. For example, they are administered in tablets or capsule form, by injection, inhalation, eye lotion, ointment, suppository, etc. administration by injection, infusion or inhalation; topical by lotion or ointment; and rectal by suppositories. Oral administrations are preferred. [00162] The phrases "parenteral administration" and "administered parenterally" as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticulare, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal and intrasternal injection and infusion. [00163] The phrases "systemic administration," "administered systemically," "peripheral administration" and "administered peripherally" as used herein mean the administration of a compound, drug or other material other than directly into the central nervous system, such that it enters the patient's system and, thus, is subject to metabolism and other like processes, for example, subcutaneous administration. [00164] These compounds may be administered to humans and other animals for therapy by any suitable route of administration, including orally, nasally, as by, for example, a spray, rectally, intravaginally, parenterally, intracisternally and topically, as by powders, ointments or drops, including buccally and sublingually. [00165] Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present invention, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically-acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art. [00166] Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. [00167] The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the particular compound of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion or metabolism of the particular compound being employed, the rate and extent of absorption, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts. [00168] A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. [00169] In general, a suitable daily dose of a compound of the invention will be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Generally, oral, intravenous, intracerebroventricular and subcutaneous doses of the compounds of this invention for a patient, when used for the indicated analgesic effects, will range from about 0.0001 to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. [00170] If desired, the effective daily dose of the active compound may be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day, optionally, in unit dosage forms. Preferred dosing is one administration per day. [00171] While it is possible for a compound of the present invention to be administered alone, it is preferable to administer the compound as a pharmaceutical formulation (composition). [00172] The compounds according to the invention may be formulated for administration in any convenient way for use in human or veterinary medicine, by analogy with other pharmaceuticals. [00173] In another aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions which comprise a therapeutically-effective amount of one or more of the subject compounds, as described above, formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (additives) and/or diluents. As described in detail below, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be specially formulated for administration in solid or liquid form, including those adapted for the following: (1) oral administration, for example, drenches (aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions), tablets, boluses, powders, granules, pastes for application to the tongue; (2) parenteral administration, for example, by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension; (3) topical application, for example, as a cream, ointment or spray applied to the skin, lungs, or mucous membranes; or (4) intravaginally or intrarectally, for example, as a pessary, cream or foam; (5) sublingually or buccally; (6) ocularly; (7) transdermally; or (8) nasally. [00174] The term "treatment" is intended to encompass also prophylaxis, therapy and cure. [00175] The patient receiving this treatment is any animal in need, including primates, in particular humans, and other mammals such as equines, cattle, swine and sheep; and poultry and pets in general. [00176] Microemulsification technology can improve bioavailability of some lipophilic (water insoluble) pharmaceutical agents. Examples include Trimetrine (Dordunoo, S. Κ., et al., Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy, 17(12), 1685-1713, 1991 and REV 5901 (Sheen, Ρ. C., et al., J Pharm Sci 80(7), 712-714, 1991). Among other things, microemulsification provides enhanced bioavailability by preferentially directing absorption to the lymphatic system instead of the circulatory system, which thereby bypasses the liver, and prevents destruction of the compounds in the hepatobiliary circulation. [00177] While all suitable amphiphilic carriers are contemplated, the presently preferred carriers are generally those that have Generally-Recognized-as-Safe (GRAS) status, and that can both solubilize the compound of the present invention and microemulsify it at a later stage when the solution comes into a contact with a complex water phase (such as one found in human gastrointestinal tract). Usually, amphiphilic ingredients that satisfy these requirements have HLB (hydrophilic to lipophilic balance) values of 2-20, and their structures contain straight chain aliphatic radicals in the range of C-6 to C-20. Examples are polyethylene-glycolized fatty glycerides and polyethylene glycols. [00178] Commercially available amphiphilic carriers are particularly contemplated, including Gelucire-series, Labrafil, Labrasol, or Lauroglycol (all manufactured and distributed by Gattefosse Corporation, Saint Priest, France), PEG-mono-oleate, PEG-di-oleate, PEG-monolaurate and di-laurate, Lecithin, Polysorbate 80, etc (produced and distributed by a number of companies in USA and worldwide). [00179] Hydrophilic polymers suitable for use in the present invention are those which are readily water-soluble, can be covalently attached to a vesicle-forming lipid, and which are tolerated in vivo without toxic effects (/.℮., are biocompatible). Suitable polymers include polyethylene glycol (PEG), polylactic (also termed polylactide), polyglycolic acid (also termed polyglycolide), a polylactic-polyglycolic acid copolymer, and polyvinyl alcohol. Preferred polymers are those having a molecular weight of from about 100 or 120 daltons up to about 5,000 or 10,000 daltons, and more preferably from about 300 daltons to about 5,000 daltons. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the polymer is polyethyleneglycol having a molecular weight of from about 100 to about 5,000 daltons, and more preferably having a molecular weight of from about 300 to about 5,000 daltons. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the polymer is polyethyleneglycol of 750 daltons (PEG(750)). Polymers may also be defined by the number of monomers therein; a preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes polymers of at least about three monomers, such PEG polymers consisting of three monomers (approximately 150 daltons). [00180] Other hydrophilic polymers which may be suitable for use in the present invention include polyvinylpyrrolidone, polymethoxazoline, polyethyloxazoline, polyhydroxypropyl methacrylamide, polymethacrylamide, polydimethylacrylamide, and derivatized celluloses such as hydroxymethylcellulose or hydroxyethylcellulose. [00181] In certain embodiments, a formulation of the present invention comprises a biocompatible polymer selected from the group consisting of polyamides, polycarbonates, polyalkylenes, polymers of acrylic and methacrylic esters, polyvinyl polymers, polyglycolides, polysiloxanes, polyurethanes and co-polymers thereof, celluloses, polypropylene, polyethylenes, polystyrene, polymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid, polyanhydrides, poly(ortho)esters, poly(butic acid), poly(valeric acid), poly(lactide-co-caprolactone), polysaccharides, proteins, polyhyaluronic acids, polycyanoacrylates, and blends, mixtures, or copolymers thereof. [00182] Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides, consisting of 6, 7 or 8 glucose units, designated by the Greek letter alpha, beta or gamma, respectively. Cyclodextrins with fewer than six glucose units are not known to exist. The glucose units are linked by alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds. As a consequence of the chair conformation of the sugar units, all secondary hydroxyl groups (at C-2, C-3) are located on one side of the ring, while all the primary hydroxyl groups at C-6 are situated on the other side. As a result, the external faces are hydrophilic, making the cyclodextrins water-soluble. In contrast, the cavities of the cyclodextrins are hydrophobic, since they are lined by the hydrogen of atoms C-3 and C-5, and by ether-like oxygens. These matrices allow complexation with a variety of relatively hydrophobic compounds, including, for instance, steroid compounds such as 17-beta-estradiol (see, e.g., van Uden et al. Plant Cell Tiss. Org. Cult. 38:1-3-113 (1994)). The complexation takes place by Van der Waals interactions and by hydrogen bond formation. For a general review of the chemistry of cyclodextrins, see, Wenz, Agnew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 33:803-822 (1994). [00183] The physico-chemical properties of the cyclodextrin derivatives depend strongly on the kind and the degree of substitution. For example, their solubility in water ranges from insoluble (e.g., triacetyl-beta-cyclodextrin) to 147% soluble (w/v) (G-2-beta-cyclodextrin). In addition, they are soluble in many organic solvents. The properties of the cyclodextrins enable the control over solubility of various formulation components by increasing or decreasing their solubility. [00184] Numerous cyclodextrins and methods for their preparation have been described. For example, Parmeter (I), et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 3,453,259) and Gramera, et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 3,459,731) described electroneutral cyclodextrins. Other derivatives include cyclodextrins with cationic properties [Parmeter (II), U.S. Pat. No. 3,453,257], insoluble crosslinked cyclodextrins (Solms, U.S. Pat. No. 3,420,788), and cyclodextrins with anionic properties [Parmeter (III), U.S. Pat. No. 3,426,011], Among the cyclodextrin derivatives with anionic properties, carboxylic acids, phosphorous acids, phosphinous acids, phosphonic acids, phosphoric acids, thiophosphonic acids, thiosulphinic acids, and sulfonic acids have been appended to the parent cyclodextrin [see, Parmeter (III), supra]. Furthermore, sulfoalkyl ether cyclodextrin derivatives have been described by Stella, et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,134,127). [00185] Liposomes consist of at least one lipid bilayer membrane enclosing an aqueous internal compartment. Liposomes may be characterized by membrane type and by size. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) have a single membrane and typically range between 0.02 and 0.05 μΐη in diameter; large unilamellar vesicles (LUVS) are typically larger than 0.05 μηΐ Oligolamellar large vesicles and multilamellar vesicles have multiple, usually concentric, membrane layers and are typically larger than 0.1 μΐη. Liposomes with several nonconcentric membranes, i.e., several smaller vesicles contained within a larger vesicle, are termed multivesicular vesicles. [00186] One aspect of the present invention relates to formulations comprising liposomes containing a compound of the present invention, where the liposome membrane is formulated to provide a liposome with increased carrying capacity. Alternatively or in addition, the compound of the present invention may be contained within, or adsorbed onto, the liposome bilayer of the liposome. The compound of the present invention may be aggregated with a lipid surfactant and carried within the liposome's internal space; in these cases, the liposome membrane is formulated to resist the disruptive effects of the active agent-surfactant aggregate. [00187] According to one embodiment of the present invention, the lipid bilayer of a liposome contains lipids derivatized with polyethylene glycol (PEG), such that the PEG chains extend from the inner surface of the lipid bilayer into the interior space encapsulated by the liposome, and extend from the exterior of the lipid bilayer into the surrounding environment. [00188] Active agents contained within liposomes of the present invention are in solubilized form. Aggregates of surfactant and active agent (such as emulsions or micelles containing the active agent of interest) may be entrapped within the interior space of liposomes according to the present invention. A surfactant acts to disperse and solubilize the active agent, and may be selected from any suitable aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic surfactant, including but not limited to biocompatible lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) of varying chain lengths (for example, from about C.sub. 14 to about C.sub.20). Polymer-derivatized lipids such as PEG-lipids may also be utilized for micelle formation as they will act to inhibit micelle/membrane fusion, and as the addition of a polymer to surfactant molecules decreases the CMC of the surfactant and aids in micelle formation. Preferred are surfactants with CMCs in the micromolar range; higher CMC surfactants may be utilized to prepare micelles entrapped within liposomes of the present invention, however, micelle surfactant monomers could affect liposome bilayer stability and would be a factor in designing a liposome of a desired stability. [00189] Liposomes according to the present invention may be prepared by any of a variety of techniques that are known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,235,871; Published PCT applications WO 96/14057; New RRC, Liposomes: A practical approach, IRL Press, Oxford (1990), pages 33-104; Lasic DD, Liposomes from physics to applications, Elsevier Science Publishers BV, Amsterdam, 1993. [00190] For example, liposomes of the present invention may be prepared by diffusing a lipid derivatized with a hydrophilic polymer into preformed liposomes, such as by exposing preformed liposomes to micelles composed of lipid-grafted polymers, at lipid concentrations corresponding to the final mole percent of derivatized lipid which is desired in the liposome. Liposomes containing a hydrophilic polymer can also be formed by homogenization, lipid-field hydration, or extrusion techniques, as are known in the art. [00191] In one aspect of the present invention, the liposomes are prepared to have substantially homogeneous sizes in a selected size range. One effective sizing method involves extruding an aqueous suspension of the liposomes through a series of polycarbonate membranes having a selected uniform pore size; the pore size of the membrane will correspond roughly with the largest sizes of liposomes produced by extrusion through that membrane. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,323 (Apr. 12, 1988). [00192] The release characteristics of a formulation of the present invention depend on the encapsulating material, the concentration of encapsulated drug, and the presence of release modifiers. For example, release can be manipulated to be pH dependent, for example, using a pH sensitive coating that releases only at a low pH, as in the stomach, or a higher pH, as in the intestine. An enteric coating can be used to prevent release from occurring until after passage through the stomach. Multiple coatings or mixtures of cyanamide encapsulated in different materials can be used to obtain an initial release in the stomach, followed by later release in the intestine. Release can also be manipulated by inclusion of salts or pore forming agents, which can increase water uptake or release of drug by diffusion from the capsule. Excipients which modify the solubility of the drug can also be used to control the release rate. Agents which enhance degradation of the matrix or release from the matrix can also be incorporated. They can be added to the drug, added as a separate phase (/.℮., as particulates), or can be co-dissolved in the polymer phase depending on the compound. In all cases the amount should be between 0.1 and thirty percent (w/w polymer). Types of degradation enhancers include inorganic salts such as ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride, organic acids such as citric acid, benzoic acid, and ascorbic acid, inorganic bases such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, zinc carbonate, and zinc hydroxide, and organic bases such as protamine sulfate, spermine, choline, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, and triethanolamine and surfactants such as Tween® and Pluronic®. Pore forming agents which add microstructure to the matrices (/.℮., water soluble compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars) are added as particulates. The range should be between one and thirty percent (w/w polymer). [00193] Uptake can also be manipulated by altering residence time of the particles in the gut. This can be achieved, for example, by coating the particle with, or selecting as the encapsulating material, a mucosal adhesive polymer. Examples include most polymers with free carboxyl groups, such as chitosan, celluloses, and especially polyacrylates (as used herein, polyacrylates refers to polymers including acrylate groups and modified acrylate groups such as cyanoacrylates and methacrylates). Pharmaceutical Combinations [00194] The invention especially relates to the use of a compound of the formula (I) (or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula (I) in the treatment of one or more of the diseases mentioned herein; wherein the response to treatment is beneficial as demonstrated, for example, by the partial or complete removal of one or more of the symptoms of the disease up to complete cure or remission. [00195] Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) ALL accounts for 15-30 % of adult ALL and up to 5% of pediatric ALL (Faderl S, Garcia-MAnero G, Thomas D, et al. Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia- Current Concepts and Future Perspectives. Rev Clin Exp Hematol 2002;6:142-160). Pediatric Ph+ ALL is characterized by an older age (median 9-10 years versus approximately 4 years for all ALL patients) and higher WBC counts at diagnosis. In both adults and children, Ph+ ALL is characterized by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (t(9;22)(q34;ql 1)) resulting in fusion of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 with ABL gene sequences translocated from chromosome 9, resulting in expression of the BCR-ABL 1 protein. There are 2 primary variants of BCR-ABL 1, pl90BCR-ABL1, detectable in approximately 85% of Ph+ ALL patients, and ρ210 BCR-ABL1, typical of CML, identified in approximately 15% of Ph+ ALL patients (Dombret Η, Galbert J, Boiron J, et al. Outcome of Treatment in Adults with Philadelphia chromosome-posititve acute lymphoblastic leukemia- Results of the prospective multicenter LALA-94 trial. Blood 2002; 100:2357-2366; Faderl S, Garcia-MAnero G, Thomas D, et al. Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia- Current Concepts and Future Perspectives. Rev Clin Exp Hematol 2002;6:142-160). [00196] The treatment of ALL is based on each patient’s risk classification, with increasingly intensive treatment for patients who are at higher risk of relapse; this strategy maximizes remission rates while limiting unnecessary toxicities. Progress has been incremental, from the introduction of combination chemotherapy and treatment for pre-symptomatic central nervous system leukemia to newer, intensive treatment regimens for patients at high risk for relapse (C. Η. Pui and W. Ε. Evans. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia New Engl J Med 1998;339:605-615;). Prior to the development of imatinib, Ph+ALL patients were treated with intensive chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), ideally with a matched related donor, as this was shown to result in improved EFS versus either HSCT with other donors or chemotherapy alone. Overall, and in contrast to the majority of pediatric patients with ALL, patients with Ph+ALL have had a dire prognosis with low rates of event free survival (EFS) (Arico Μ, Valsecchi Μ G, Camitta Β, Schrappe Μ, Chessells J, Baruchel A, Gaynon Ρ, Silverman L, Janka-Schaub G, Kamps W, et al. New Engl J Med 2000;342:998-1006). [00197] A compound of formula (I) can also be used in combination with other antineoplastic compounds.

Additional Processes for Making Compounds of the Invention [00248] A compound of the invention can be prepared as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt by reacting the free base form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acid. Alternatively, a pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt of a compound of the invention can be prepared by reacting the free acid form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic base. [00249] Compounds of the formula (I) can also be modified by appending appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Modifications of this kind are known in the art and include those that increase penetration into a given biological system (e.g. blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system, testis), increase bioavailability, increase solubility to allow parenteral administration (e.g. injection, infusion), alter metabolism and/or alter the rate of secretion. Examples of this type of modifications include but are not limited to esterification, e.g. with polyethylene glycols, derivatisation with pivaloyloxy or fatty acid substituents, conversion to carbamates, hydroxylation of aromatic rings and heteroatom substitution in aromatic rings. Whereever compounds of the formula (1), and/or N-oxides, tautomers and/or (preferably pharmaceutically acceptable) salts thereof are mentioned, this comprises such modified formulae, while preferably the molecules of the formula (1), their N-oxides, their tautomers and/or their salts are meant. [00250] Alternatively, the salt forms of the compounds of the invention can be prepared using salts of the starting materials or intermediates. In view of the close relationship between the novel compounds of the formula (1) in free form and those in the form of their salts, including those salts that can be used as intermediates, for example in the purification or identification of the novel compounds, any reference to the compounds or a compound of the formula (1) hereinbefore and hereinafter is to be understood as referring to the compound in free form and/or also to one or more salts thereof, as appropriate and expedient, as well as to one or more solvates, e.g. hydrates. [00251] Salts are formed, for example, as acid addition salts, preferably with organic or inorganic acids, from compounds of formula (1) with a basic nitrogen atom, especially the pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable inorganic acids are, for example, halogen acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid. Suitable organic acids are, for example, carboxylic, phosphonic, sulfonic or sulfamic acids, for example acetic acid, propionic acid, octanoic acid, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, malonic acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, amino acids, such as glutamic acid or aspartic acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid, methylmaleic acid, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, adamantanecarboxylic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, 4-aminosalicylic acid, phthalic acid, phenylacetic acid, mandelic acid, cinnamic acid, methane- or ethane-sulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, ethane-1,2-disulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 4-toluenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonic acid, 2- or 3-methylbenzenesulfonic acid, methylsulfuric acid, ethylsulfuric acid, dodecylsulfuric acid, N-cyclohexylsulfamic acid, N-methyl-, N-ethyl- or N-propyl-sulfamic acid, or other organic protonic acids, such as ascorbic acid. Salts can usually be converted to free compounds, e.g. by treating with suitable basic compounds, for example with alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, or alkali metal hydroxides, typically potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide. [00252] For isolation or purification purposes it is also possible to use pharmaceutically unacceptable salts, for example picrates or perchlorates. For therapeutic use, only pharmaceutically acceptable salts or free compounds are employed (where applicable in the form of pharmaceutical preparations), and these are therefore preferred. [00253] The free acid or free base forms of the compounds of the invention can be prepared from the corresponding base addition salt or acid addition salt from, respectively. For example a compound of the invention in an acid addition salt form can be converted to the corresponding free base by treating with a suitable base (e.g., ammonium hydroxide solution, sodium hydroxide, and the like). A compound of the invention in a base addition salt form can be converted to the corresponding free acid by treating with a suitable acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, etc.). [00254] Compounds of the invention in unoxidized form can be prepared from N-oxides of compounds of the invention by treating with a reducing agent (e.g., sulfur, sulfur dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus trichloride, tribromide, or the like) in a suitable inert organic solvent (e.g. acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or the like) at 0 to 80°C. [00255] Prodrug derivatives of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., for further details see Saulnier MG, Langley DR, Kadow JF, Senter PD, Knipe JO, Tun MM, Vyas DM and Doyle TW (1994) Synthesis of etoposide phosphate, BMY-4048 1: a watersoluble clinically active prodrug of etoposide. Bioorg Med Chem Lett 4:2567-2572; and Rautio J, Kumpulainen Η, Heimbach Τ, Oliyai R, Oh D, Jarvinen Τ and Savolainen J (2008). For example, a compound of the invention can form a prodrug as shown: [00256] Protected derivatives of the compounds of the invention can be made by means known to those of ordinary skill in the art. If one or more other functional groups, for example carboxy, hydroxy, amino, sulfhydryl or the like are or need to be protected in a starting material as described herein or any other precursor, because they should not take part in the reaction or disturb the reaction, these are such groups as are usually used in the synthesis of peptide compounds, and also of cephalosporins and penicillins, as well as nucleic acid derivatives and sugars. Protecting groups are such groups that are no longer present in the final compounds once they are removed, while groups that remain as substituents are not protecting groups in the sense used here which are groups that are added at a starting material or intermediate stage and removed to obtain a final compound. Also in the case of conversions of a compound of the formula (I) into a different compound of the formula (I), protecting groups may be introduced and removed, if useful or required. The protecting groups may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions, such as acylations, etherifications, esterifications, oxidations, solvolysis, and similar reactions. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions, to removal, typically by acetolysis, protonolysis, solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, and that they are not present in the end-products. The specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned above and below. [00257] The protection of such functional groups by such protecting groups, the protecting groups themselves, and their removal reactions are described for example in standard reference works, such as J. F. W. McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London and New York 1973, in Τ. W. Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Third edition, Wiley, New York 1999, in "The Peptides"; Volume 3 (editors: Ε. Gross and J. Meienhofer), Academic Press, London and New York 1981, in "Methoden der organischen Chemie" {Methods of organic chemistry), Houben Weyl, 4th edition, Volume 15/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974, in H.-D. Jakubke and Η. Jescheit, "Aminosauren, Peptide, Proteine" {Amino acids, peptides, proteins), Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, and Basel 1982, and in Jochen Lehmann, "Chemie der Kohlenhydrate: Monosaccharide und Derivate" {Chemistry of carbohydrates: monosaccharides and derivatives), Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974. [00258] Compounds of the present invention can be conveniently prepared, or formed during the process of the invention, as solvates {e.g., hydrates). Hydrates of compounds of the present invention can be conveniently prepared by recrystallization from an aqueous/organic solvent mixture, using organic solvents such as dioxin, tetrahydrofuran or methanol. [00259] Compounds of the invention can be prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. While resolution of enantiomers can be carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds of the invention, dissociable complexes are preferred {e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties {e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and can be readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities. Diastereomeric mixtures for example may be separated into their individual diastereomers by means of fractionated crystallization, chromatography, solvent distribution, and similar procedures. This separation may take place either at the level of a starting compound or in a compound of formula (1) itself. Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of diastereomeric salts, for example by salt formation with an enantiomer-pure chiral acid, or by means of chromatography, for example by HPLC, using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands.The optically pure enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from their racemic mixture can be found in Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel Η. Wilen, “Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions”, John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981. [00260] In summary, the compounds of formula (I) can be made by a process, which involves: (a) those of reaction schemes I-IV; and (b) optionally converting a compound of the invention into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt; salt form; (c) optionally converting a salt form of a compound of the invention to a ηοη- (d) optionally converting an unoxidized form of a compound of the invention into a pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxide; (℮) optionally converting an N-oxide form of a compound of the invention to its unoxidized form; (f) optionally resolving an individual isomer of a compound of the invention from a mixture of isomers; (g) optionally converting a non-derivatized compound of the invention into a pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug derivative; and (h) optionally converting a prodrug derivative of a compound of the invention to its non-derivatized form.

Assays [00768] The utility of the compounds of the invention described herein can be evidenced by testing in the following assays. Compounds of the invention were assessed for their ability to inhibit ABL1 activity in biochemical assays and BCR-ABL1 in cellular assays described below. Biochemical Assays [00769] Expression and purification of protein kinase - Expression and purification of human ABL was performed using standard expression purification procedures. The ABL64-515 protein was generated and used for in vitro kinase assays. The protein was generated by a coexpression vector carrying the DNA fragments for ABL1 (la isoform, with an N-terminal His6-tag followed by a PreScission protease cleavage site) and the human protein tyrosine phosphatase-1Β (residues 1-283, untagged), using the dual expression vector pCDF Duet-1 (Novagen). The His-ABL was expressed in E.coli BL21 (DE3) and the ABL proteins were isolated by Ni-affinity on aNi-NTA column (Qiagen). The His-tag was removed by PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) and the non-phosphoprylated ABL further purified on a Mono Q HR 10/10 (GE Healthcare, mono-phosphorylated ABL is about 10-20 % of total ABL protein) and HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare). Non-phosphorylated ABL64-515 proteins were analyzed by mass spectroscopic analysis and flash-frozen in aliquots and stored at 80°C. SRC (amino acids 83-535 or Src83-535) was expressed and purified as described (S.W. Cowan-Jacob, G. Fendrich, P.W. Manley, W. Jahnke, D. Fabbro, J. Liebetanz, Τ. Meyer, c-Src crystal structure provides insights into c-Src activation. Structure 13 (2005) 861-871). Radio ABL1 (64-515) assay [00770] For determination of ABL kinase activity, the radiometric filter-binding assay was used. The assay was performed by mixing 10 pL of the compound pre-diluted with 10 pL of ATP (20 ρΜ ATP with 0.1 pCi [γ-33Ρ)-ΑΤΡ) with the phospho-acceptor peptide poly[Ala6Glu2LysHBr5Tyrl] = polyAEKY) in 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgC'F, 0.01 mM Na3VC>4, 50 mM NaCl. 10 pL of enzyme (ranging between 5 ηΜ to 20 ηΜ) was added to initiate the reaction. Pre-incubation of enzyme with compounds (when stated) was performed by exposing the enzyme to compounds prior to addition of the substrate mixture (ATP and/or peptide substrate). After 15 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 pL 125 mM EDTA, and the peptide-bound 33Ρ separated on filter-plates (PVDF or MAIP; Millipore, Volketswil, Switzerland) prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Filter-plates were washed 3χ with 0.5% Η3ΡΟ4, followed by addition of 30 pL scintillation cocktail (Microscint, Perkin Elmer) per well and then analysed in a TopCount ΝΧΤ scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer). Results were expressed as IC50 values. The Km values for ATP were determined by assaying the ABL kinase with increasing concentrations of ATP and keeping the exogenous acceptor protein substrate (poly-AEKY) at a constant concentration (at about 2-fold its Km) and vice versa. Km and Vmax were calculated according to Eadie-Hofstee as described (D. Fabbro, G. Fendrich, V. Guez, Τ. Meyer, Ρ. Furet, J. Mestan, J.D. Griffin, P.W. Manley, S.W. Cowan-Jacob, Targeted therapy with imatinib: An exception or a rule? Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 167, Inhibitors of Protein Kinases and Protein Phosphates (2005) 361-389). The data were plotted as V versus V/S, where V is the velocity of the reaction at a given substrate (S) concentration, and fitted to a straight line using linear regression analysis, where the slope of the line corresponds to -Km and the Y-intercept represents the Vmax. Caliper ABL1 (64-515) assay [00771] All assays were performed in 384-well microtiter plates. Each assay plate contained 8-point serial dilutions for 40 test compounds, as well as four 8-point serial dilutions of staurosporine as a reference compound, plus 16 high and 16 low controls. Liquid handling and incubation steps were done on a Thermo CatX workstation equipped with Innovadyne Nanodrop Express. Between pipetting steps, tips were cleaned in wash cycles using wash buffer. [00772] The assay plates were prepared by addition of 50 nL per well of compound solution in 90% DMSO. The kinase reactions were started by stepwise addition of 4.5 pL per well of peptide/ATP-solution (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% BSA, 0.6% DMSO, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, and 10 μΜ sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM MgCF, 2 mM MnCF, 4 μΜ ATP, 4 μΜ peptide (FITC-Ahx-EAIYAAPFAKKK-NH2)) and 4.5 pL per well of enzyme solution (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% BSA, 0.6% DMSO, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, and 10 μΜ sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM MgCF, 2mM MnCF, 3.5 ηΜ ABL (ABL(64-515), produced in-house from Ε. coli)). Kinase reactions were incubated at 30°C for 60 minutes and subsequently terminated by addition of 16 pL per well of stop solution (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5% DMSO, 0.1% Caliper coating reagent, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.015% Brij35). Plates with terminated kinase reactions were transferred to the Caliper LC3000 workstations for reading. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides were separated using the Caliper microfluidic mobility shift technology. Briefly, samples from terminated kinase reactions were applied to the chip. Analytes are transported through the chip by constant buffer flow and the migration of the substrate peptide is monitored by the fluorescence signal of its label. Phosphorylated peptide (product) and unphosphorylated peptide (substrate) are separated in an electric field by their charge/mass ratio. Kinase activities were calculated from the amounts of formed phospho-peptide. 1C50 values were determined from percent inhibition values at different compound concentrations by non-linear regression analysis. [00773] Preparation of compound dilutions: Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO (10 mM) and transferred into 1,4mL flat bottom or V-shaped Matrix tubes carrying a unique 2D matrix. The stock solutions were stored at +2°C if not used immediately. For the test procedure the vials were defrosted and identified by a scanner whereby a working sheet was generated that guided the subsequent working steps. [00774] Compound dilutions were made in 96-well plates. This format enabled the assay of maximally 40 individual test compounds at 8 concentrations (single points) including 4 reference compounds. The dilution protocol included the production of “pre-dilution plates”, “master plates” and “assay plates”. [00775] Pre-dilution plates: Polypropylene 96-well plates were used as pre-dilution plates. A total of 4 pre-dilution plates were prepared including 10 test compounds each on the plate positions Α1-Α10, one standard compound at Α11 and one DMSO control at Α12. All dilution steps were done on a HamiltonSTAR robot. [00776] Master plates: 30 pL of individual compound dilutions including standard compound and controls of the 4 “pre-dilution plates” were transferred into a 384 “master plate” including the following concentrations Τ810, 362, 72.5, 54.6, 14.5, 2.9, 0.58 and 0.12μΜ, respectively in 90% of DMSO. [00777] Assay plates: Identical “assay plates” were then prepared by pipetting 50nL each of compound dilutions of the “master plates” into 384-well “assay plates” by means of a HummingBird 384-channel dispenser. These plates were used directly for the assay which was performed in a total volume of 9.05 pL. This led to a final compound concentration of 10, 2.0, 0.4, 0.08, 0.016, 0.0032, 0.00064 and 0.000128 μΜ and a final DMSO concentration of 0.5 % in the assay. Cellular Assays [00778] To assess the ability of compounds of the invention to inhibit BCR-ABL1 activity in cellular assays, compounds were evaluated for their ability to selectively inhibit the proliferation of cells dependent on BCR-ABL1 expression relative to cells that do not depend on BCR-ABL1 expression. [00779] The murine bone marrow-derived cell line Ba/F3 was used to generate the appropriate cell line models. Ba/F3 cells were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig and DSMZ No. ACC 300). Parental Ba/F3 cells depend on IL3 for growth and survival and were used as the reference cell line that does not depend on BCR-ABL1 activity for growth and survival. These cells are referred to as Ba/F3-WT. [00780] To generate Ba/F3 cells that depend on BCR-ABL1 expression for growth and survival, Ba/F3 cells were engineered to express BCR-ABL1 using retroviral transduction with a MSCV based retroviral vector containing a ρ210 BCR-ABL1 expression cassette. When grown in the absence of IL-3, the proliferation of the cells is dependent on the expression of BCR-ABL1. (Daley, G.Q. and Baltimore, D. Transformation of an interleukin 3-dependent hematopoietic cell line by the chronic myeloid leukemia-specific ρ210 BCR-ABL1 protein. PNAS 1988;85:9312-9316). These cells are referred to as Ba/F3-BCR-ABL-WT. A similar approach was used to generate Ba/F3 cells that depend on a BCR-ABL1 variant in which threonine 315 is replaced with isoleucine. These cells are referred to as Ba/F3-BCR-ABL-T315I. [00781] Ba/F3-WT cells were maintained in RPMI1640 media with L-glutamine, HEPES (Lonza), 10% FBS (Gibco) and 5ng/ml IL-3 (Calbiochem). Ba/F3-BCR-ABL1-WT cells and Ba/F3-BCR-ABLl-T315I cells were manitained in RPMI1640 media with L-glutamine, HEPES (Lonza) and 10% FBS (Gibco). Proliferation assay [00782] For each cell line, the cell density was adjusted to 50 000 cells/mL and 50 qL (2500 cells) added per well of a 384-well assay plate. [00783] Test compounds were resuspended in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. A serial three-fold dilution of each compound with DMSO was performed in 384-well plates using the Janus Liquid Dispenser (PerkinElmer). Compound was delivered to the assay plates containing 2500 cells in a 50 qL volume via Acoustic delivery from an ATS-100 (EDC). For Ba/F3-BCR-ABL1-WT cell assays, 2 nL of each compound dilution was transferred to the assay plate for final assay concentrations of 0.4 μΜ, 0.13 μΜ, 0.044 μΜ, 0.015 μΜ, 0.005 μΜ, 0.001 μΜ, 0.00033 μΜ, 0.00011 μΜ, 0.000037 μΜ, 0.000012 μΜ. For Ba/F3-WT and Ba/F3-BCR-ABL1-T3151 cell assays, 50 nL of each compound dilution was transferred to the assay plate for final assay concentrations oflOqM, 3.33 μΜ, 1.11 μΜ, 0.37 μΜ, 0.12 μΜ, 0.041 μΜ, 0.014 μΜ, 0.0046 μΜ, 0.0015 μΜ, 0.00051 μΜ. [00784] Cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified environment with 5% carbon dioxide for 48 hours. Britelite plus solution (Perkin Elmer) was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions and 25 qL added to each well of the assay plate. Plates were incubated for 3-5 minutes and the luminescence detected on an EnVision Multimode plate reader (Perkin Elmer). The degree of luminescence correlates with the number of cells in each well. The effect of each inhibitor concentration can therefore be calculated and IC50 values generated. [00785] The compounds of the invention show IC50 values in the range of 0.1 ηΜ to 20 ηΜ for inhibition of Abl kinase activity in a radiometric filter binding (Radio). For a microfluidic mobilitiy shift assays (Caliper) assay, IC50 values can be found in the range of 0.1 ηΜ to 20 ηΜ. For Ba/F3-BCR-ABL-WT and Τ3151 cellular proliferation assay, GI50 values can be found in the range of 0.5 ηΜ to 50 ηΜ and 10 ηΜ to 2000 ηΜ, respectively.
