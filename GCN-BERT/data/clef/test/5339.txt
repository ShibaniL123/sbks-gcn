BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to drinking water, and more particularly to a preparation method of healthy drinking water which is rich in anion, minerals and oxygen. Tourmaline, a kind of silicate minerals, is a multi-element natural mineral, which contains at least 10 trace elements beneficial to human body, such as magnesium, aluminum, iron and boron. Tourmaline was first discovered in Sri Lanka, and was regarded as precious as diamond and ruby. It was noticed that tourmaline would take charge when heated, and this phenomenon was known as the pyroelectric effect, and that is why it was called “tourmaline”. Korean sweat steaming originated in South Korea, and it experienced several times to evolve from the old Wong Nai Khan into today's high-tech, high-performance, multi-purpose new generation of tourmaline Khan steam. Tourmaline Khan steam is a kind of high-fever physical therapy which uses tourmaline and infrared reflection principle to heat people sweat. By absorbing far-infrared rays, anion, metastable ion and mineral elements released by tourmaline after heating, people's skin metabolizes hazardous substance to improve skin elasticity and promote blood circulation and metabolism, so as to achieve the role of beauty, body and treatment of some chronic diseases. In short, tourmaline has a very obvious effect on improving human health, beauty and diet. Inorganic microporous compound component containing a certain number of holes in the solid is called porous material, and it is a kind of materials which have network structure of interconnected or closed holes, and the boundary or surface of the holes is constituted of pillar or tablet. Two-dimensional network structure is one of the typical network structure, which is formed by a large number of polygonal holes gathered in the plane, and materials with these structures is known as “honeycomb” material as its shape is similar to the honeycomb's hexagonal structure. Three-dimensional network structure is a more common network structure, which is formed by a large number of polyhedron-shape holes gathered in space, and materials with these structures are often called foam material. At present, only natural water, mineral water and pure water can be use as drinking water. Tap water is a kind of natural water, which is safe, consistent with body functions and contains beneficial mineral substance. However, the tap water has some problems, such as pipe network's aging, residual chlorine and other secondary pollutions. Anyway, if it can be purified deeply, the tap water can make a more popular and healthy water. The mineral water contains more minerals, but more is not better, and it is not suitable for long-term consumption. In recent years, the mineral water's poor taste and few species cause the recession of its market share. Some mineral water even contains a high level of harmful components, such as light metal and heavy metal, and some even has a high redox potential. The pure water is very different from the traditional drinking water, and it contains a very small amount of trace elements. It has many advantages, such as no bacteria, no virus and clean. However, as the body fluids is slightly alkaline, if people drink slightly acid pure water for a long term, the in vivo environment of the body will be damaged, so people need to choose weak base pure water.

Advantageous Effect of Invention First, pH of the water prepared by the present invention is weakly basic with a pH value of 7.6±0.4, which is coordinated with the body fluids which is slightly alkaline with a pH value of 7.38-7.44, so a long-term consumption of this kind of water is beneficial to human body. Second, the water prepared by the present invention is rich in anion, which is also known as “air vitamin” and has the role of adjusting ion balance of the body. The anion can make people relax, activate cells and improve the natural healing power, and it also can inhibit oxidation or aging of the body. There are many factors that may cause the generation of positive ions in today's environment, which makes people often in a state of tension. And therefore, the anion is an indispensable material for modern humans. In addition, the anion also has a deodorant effect. Third, the water prepared by the present invention has a high content of oxygen which is in an amount of 8 mg/L or more according to the actual testing. The high content oxygen can accelerate the blood and lymph circulation, and more oxygen transported to the cells can promote cell activation more rapidly. So the water can be easily absorbed by the body and promote the body's metabolism. Besides, the water molecular beam combined by water molecules of the water prepared by the present invention is quite small, which can remove chlorine or impurities from the water to obtain water with good taste and high body-penetration. Furthermore, the water prepared by the present invention has a negative potential and the pH of the negative potential water is alkaline, which can balance the lactic acid in the body brought by fatigue. The negative potential water has a high calcium ion content, which is beneficial to the health of the human body; and the negative potential water has a high water solubility and strong penetration, so it has the ability to emulsify fats, which will be helpful to alleviate the symptoms of high blood cholesterol, high cholesterol, high blood viscosity due to high protein, high-calorie induced by diet. Moreover, negative potential water can make the cells always keep vitality and maintain healthy, while anion can help to remove harmful chromate, nitrite and heavy metals and inert metal from the body. The above factors make the negative potential water become a health-care drinking water. In addition, it is proved that the negative potential water can also inhibit the propagation of microorganisms, including bacteria, algae, etc., so the water can also be used in farms, large aquarium and swimming pool. Moreover, the conductivity of the water prepared by the present invention is less than or equal to 30 μs/cm. In addition, the water prepared by the present invention has a variety of healthy, ionized and effective mineral ions, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+, Fe2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, As3+, K+, Na+, F−, Cl−, which are easier to be absorbed and beneficial to the health of human body.
