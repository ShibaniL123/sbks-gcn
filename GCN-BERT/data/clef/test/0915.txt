Example 6
DY323 (Berberine-Phenylboronic Hybrid).
To a solution of (3-aminomethylphenyl) boronic acid hydrochloride (0.25 g, 1.33 mmol) in 5 ml of methanol, 0.2 mL of triethyl amine (Et3N) was added to the stirred solution. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 2 h to provide 3-aminoboronic acid free base, and then the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. To a stirred solution of phenylboronic free base was added a solution of berberine chloride (0.74 g, 2.1 mmol) in warm ethanol (50 mL) and the reaction mixture was refluxed 4 hours. After cooling down, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. Solidified by EtOAc, filtrated on a Buchner apparatus, extensively rinsed with EtOAc, and ethanol and then dried under vacuum at 50° C. overnight, to give a desired product DY323 (FIG. 15) as a red solid (0.39 mg, 61%), mp: 228.7° C.
