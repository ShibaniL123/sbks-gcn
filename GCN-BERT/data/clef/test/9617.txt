Example 4: Synthesis of racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.monooxalate
Methanol solution (18.00 g) containing racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine (3.00 g:23.8 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and methanol solution (11.15 g) containing oxalic acid (2.14 g: 23.8 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.monooxalate (4.55 g: 21.0 mmol, yield=89%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 280° C.
