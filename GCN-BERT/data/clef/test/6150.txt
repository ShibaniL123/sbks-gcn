Example 299A
3-(2-Methoxy-2-methylpropyl)-5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1-(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carbaldehyde
498 mg (3.6 mmol) of potassium carbonate were added to a solution of 450 mg (1.44 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 288A in 15 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 15 min. Then 969 mg (4.32 mmol) of 1,1,1-trifluoro-3-iodopropane were added, and the mixture was stirred at 50Â° C. for 18 h. The DMF was then very substantially distilled off and the remaining residue was partitioned between semisaturated sodium chloride solution (100 ml) and ethyl acetate (50 ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The residue obtained was chromatographed using a silica gel cartridge (Biotage, 50 g of silica gel, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate). 463 mg (79% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
