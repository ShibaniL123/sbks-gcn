This invention relates to electric fuses of the cartridge type and, in particular, concerns structural improvement in low voltage high-rupturing capacity fuses of this type adapted normally to carry relatively large current such, for instance, as of the oixter of 30 amperes ,and ever, whereby to ensure greater eeononzy in production and efficacy and rehability in use than hitherto obtainable with the known constructions of such devices, and generally to result in a construe(ion which is especially adapted for the economical mass-pr ducl ion of such devices over a wide range of rated capacity. According to the invention an electric fuse of the type referred to comprises one, but preferably a plurality, of fusible elements, each in the form of a wire or ribbon o,' strip of silver or like good eleetrieM conducting material which is res, dily fusible and having its opposite ends attached, by fusion, to respective reinforcing or " backing " members in the form of relatively stout strips or rods of copper or like good electrical conducting mat 6 - rial, which fusible element or elements and backing attachments is/are mounted in tubular housing or " barrel ", or equivalently in spaced bores in a solid barrel, of ceramic or like refractory good electrical insulating material, with ifls/tlmir backing a+ ta hments secured by soldering or brazing to metal end-plates clamped to oppeslte ends of sa 1 d barrel and hang attached thereto, preferably by brazing, respective metal connecting tags or lugs. With ibis arrangement, since the fusible elements with their backing attachments are directly attached by soldemng or brazing to the end-plates, good electrical contact with the fusible elements is assured without any 1 eliance being placed upon maintenance of mechanical pressure; moreover, with the number of soft-soldered joints which need be tirade in he circuit of a fnsihle element reduced o a minimum of two, namely one each between the backing attachments thereof and the respective end-plates, and th resultant elimination of the deterioration to which sof - soldered joints are known to be prone, greater reliability in the finished fuse is assured. Conveniently, each end-plate is provided with a plurality of c :rcularlv distributed, and preferably equi-spaced, apertures through which he backing attachments at the appertaining end ave adapted to be passed; these attachments may have their ends turned over on the outside of the appertaining end-plates after the attached fusible element has been pulled substantially taut, and the turnedever ends + hen soldered to the end-plates. In addition to tim supporting and spacing of the fusible elements afforded by the method of attachment to end- plates, it s preferred to employ additional spacing elements locating on the inner side of the end-plates, which may assist in the support of the elements. For instance, in one form a spacing member may comprise a disc, conveniently of peripheral shape conforming to that of the barrel, having a plurality of circularly-distributed apertures, correspondingly spaced to the apertures in the endplate with which it is to be associated, and stepped in he axial direction of said disc at a radius substantially the same as that. at which the circularly-distributed apertures are formed wherein; wi h this arrangement it is contemplated that the step of each spacing member wii! serve in the mounting and retaining of the backing attachments passing through the apertures in said spacing member so that they extend substantially parallel with the axis of the fuse barrel. In this form the spacing members may conveniently be constructed as stampings of brass or other metal In an alternative form, adapted more particularly" for the higher ratings, for instance of the order of over 600 amperes, the spacing members may each comprise a solid disc of ceramic or like refractory goo4 electrical insulating material, having a plurality of circularly-dis(rib((ted bores correspondingly spaced to the apertures in the end-plate, and preferably to tunnels in the fuse-barrel which will generally be employed to pass respective fusible elements or groups thereof in such higher ratings of fuse product. In yet further alternative form, a spacing member may be constructed as a solid disc having peripheral recesses after the manner of a toothed" wheel. Whilst it is generally preferred to arrange for the spacing members be clamped between the ends of the fuse barrel and the end-pieties, in some cases the spacers may h so shaped as to fit into recesses in the fuse barrel. The apertures or through bores in the spacers may be of any suitable form, in some cases circular and in other races rectangular. P : ONE H]GItE'R OPENSHAW, MANCHESTER ]N Ttl COUNTY OF ]: RITISH COMPANY. ascertains th natu e oJ the invention and the ame s to be performed. Advantageously the end-plates may be attached by butt brazing, preferably with a silver solder, to metal connecting tags of strip form tiering in end-on relationship with said end-plates thus to ensure mechanical strength of fuse product; these ta s may be of other form as hereinafter indicated. The end-plates may conveniently be clamped to the end of the fuse. barrel by means of respective metal endcaps, is formed ith a slo throtagh which the connecting tag passes and having a cylindrical flange fitting over the end of the barrel and a tacbed thereto, preferably by refractory cement. The cement fillings between the barrel and the end-caps may be keyed by means of radial projections. or alternatively radial indentations, formed on the outside of the barrel during m nufacture thmeof, and/or indentations or pro 1 ections circumferentially disposed round the flange of the end-caps. Usually the fusible elements and the major portions of their backing attachments will be completely embedded in granular refractory material such as sand filling the interior of the fuse barrel. The ends of the fuse may be sealed with refractory cement so as to provide a cx)mplete gastighv enclosure for the fusible elements and embedding material. Preferably washers of asbestos or the like are interposed between the end-plates and the ends of the fuse barrel whereby to assist in rendering the enclosure gaslight. In the ease of certain ratings of fuse some of the apertures in the end-plates and spacing members may be used for the mounting of resistance wires or strips. Advantageously further apertures may be provided in the end-plates and spacing members a a radius smaller tb fi that of the apertures for metalling the fusible elements as previously described, said additional apertures being, conveniently utilised in some cases tor the mounting el other fusible elements and backing attachments or for the mounting of wires or strips of relatively high electrical resistance for the higher ratings of fuse. Also for certain of the higher ratings a refractory liner may be included between the barrel and the sand or other filling. In order that the invention may be fully understood reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, in which : Figure 1 is a perspective vie of a cartridge t pe fuse constructed in accordance with the invention, with parts of the fuse shown as broken away to reveal parts which would otherwise be unexposed. Figure 2 is an elevational view of a spacing member forming part of the fuse of Figure 1, and Figure 3 is a view of the spacing member which is taken at right angles to that in Figure 2 and in which there is also shown one fusible efement with its backing or reinforcing attachments in %- lation to an aperture in the spacing member at an intermediate stage in the assembly of the fuse, while Figures 4 and 5 are ( rrespondin views of a spacing member which may be used instead of the spacing member shown in Figures 2 and 3, Figure 6 is an eleva iona! view of an end-plat with an alternative form of attached connecting tag, and Figure 7 is a view of the eud-plato and 'connecting tag taken at right angles to the view of Figure 6. In the fuse shown in Figure 1, the fusible elements are indicated at 1; they are each in the form of a wire of silver and will he cut to a length somewhat larger than that which is normally required for the finished fuse. As indicated in Figures 1 and 3, each fusible element is attache4, by fusion, at its ends to backing attachments la and lb respectively, each such backing attachment being in the form of a copper strip eonvenieatly formed at one end with an indent la (Figure 3) to receive an end of the fusible element and at the other end with a chamfer la (Figure 3) to facilitate threading through the spacer and end-plate s later referred to; the backing strip is also bent intermediately s shown at la" (Figure 3) for the purpose later referred to. The attachment of the fusible element with the backing strips is erected by brazing, in which process the excess length of the fusible element will be utilised as solder. The number of fusible elements 1 employed will depend upon the capacity rating of the required fuse, but it will be understood that they will all be treated in the same way. The backing attachments la and l b at opposite ends ef the several fusible elements 1 are arrange to extend through aperture members which function in the RUPEE. proper spacing apart of the fusible elements, being accordingly referred to as spacers, and also to assist m their mounlng m substant 1 Mly parallel relationship. In t, he form shown in Figures 2 and 3, each spacer 2 composes a metM disc formed with an outer row of mrcularly distributed and equally spaced apertures 2a, an inner row of circularly distributed and equally spaced apertures 2b, together w 1 th central aperture 2c; nmreover, the aperlured disc 2 is stepped in the axial direction as indicated at 2d and 2e, substantially at the radii of the circularly distributed apertures 2a and 2b respectively. Each backing attachment la, lb for a fusible element will be threaded through one of the apertures 2a irL the spacer, as indicated for attachment la in Figure 3, the fusible element ai)d its backing attachment, s when fitted being of such length that, as shown in Figure 3, the bend law rests subsLal tially against the step 2e and an appreciable amount of the backing attachment project beyond the outer, that is, unstopped, face of the spacing member 2; the apertures 2b may be used to pass the hacking attachments for other fusible elements, the bends 1am whereof will then rest against the step 2d in the spacer. At 4 in Figure 1 is indicated a resistance wire which may be used alone or together with other such wires according to the capacity rating of the fuse, each belch wire being threaded through apertures 2a or 2b in the spacers. The spacers 2 through which extend the backing attachment.s at opposite ends of the fusible element or elements and opposite ends of the resistance wire or wires where such are provided, are engaged each on its outer, that is unstopped, surface, ith a metal end-plate 5. Each such end-plate comprises a brass or other metal disc formed with one er more rows of apertures, which row or rows is!are at a radius or radii corresponding wi h the row or rows of apertures in a spacer 2, with the apertures in the row or each row for the end-pla cilvularly distributed with equal spacing correspondence with the apertures in the row or each of the rows in the spacer 2. At 6 are indicated copper or other meta! tags, convey nientlv of strip form, secured in end-on relationship to respective end-plates 5, preferably by butt brazing. At, 7 is a fuse barrel conveniently in the form of a cylindrical tube of ceramio el like material being of length such as completely to surround the fusible elements arrd instance wire or wires and to engage at opposite ends wit the spacers 2, but preferably with asbestos or like washers 8 bearing against said spacers for the purpose of rendering gas-tight the closure of the ba 1 rel. In some eases, usually for the higher ratings of fuse, a liner 9 of ceramic or like refraeto .ry material mav be fitted into the barrel 7 to extend substantially over the whole length of the fusible elements. End caps 10, conveniently of metal, are arranged to fit over the end plates 2, being formed with apertures 10a to pass the connecting ta s 6 attached to the end-plates and with cylindrical flanges 10b extending over the ends of the barrel 7 and looking in grooves 7a in said barrel as shown. Although the connecting tags 6 may be secured centrally of the end caps 10 they may be in part offset as indmabed in chain-dotted line in the drawing. In assembling the fuse it is convenient to support one endlate 5 with its attached connecting ag 6 and to place a spacing member 2 upon the end-plate with the apertures 2a, 2b and so forth in register with corresponding apertures in the end-plate. Then the fusible elements 1 with backing attachments la and lb secured thereto, of a number corresponding to the desired rating of the fuse, together ith any resistance elements 4 winch are to l,e utilised to give such desired rating, are threaded through the respective apertures in the spacing memhcr 2 and endplate 5, untd the bends la" in the backing attachments la re t in contact with the step 2e in the spacer. Thereafter tlle fuse banal 7 is threaded over the fusible elements and resistances unit! one end enrages with the exposed surface of the spacer 2, or preferably with asbestos washer 8 fittecl to spacer 2. The ends of the backing attaclunents lb at the other end of the fusible elements and the end or ends of tl e resistance wire or wires 4 which now protrnde from the open end of the fuse barrel 7 are threaded through apertures in another spacer 2 and eorre sponding apertures in another end-plate 5, to which end-plat there will already be attached as described a conuecting tag 6. This spacer 2 and end-plate 5, with attached connecting tag 6, are brought up t th open end of the fuse barrel 7, preferably to clamp an asbestos washer 8 between the barrel and-the spacer. Pressure is then appqoexl to the end-plates 5 in the direction for forcing them together and, with the fusible elements 1 and resistance wire or wires pulled subs£antiaJly taut, the projecting ends of the backing attachments la, lb and resistance, elexaents 4 are bent over, as indicated in the upper part of Figure 1," so as to lie along the ou r surface of the respective endplates 5. The thus turned-over ends of the hacking attach- mints la, lb and resistance sires 4 are then attached by soldering o the outer surfaces of the end-plates 5. One end of the fuse is then scale4 by cement, applied ix) the putslde ot the end-plate 5, namely hermetically o dose the apertures 2a, 2b and forth through which extend the backing at aohments and resistance sires, and a filling of sand er like refractory granular or pulverulent medmm is run into the fuse barrel 7, through the aperture 2c at the opposite end, so as completely to embed the fusible elements and resistance wires. With the fuse barrel completely filled, the other end ef the fuse is hermetmally sealed, likest by cement. Then the end-caps 10 are threaded over the connecting tags 6 and passed over the ends of the barrel 7 the space between the barrel and the end caps being conveniently sealed by cement, filling. Finally the end-c ps 10 are secured to the barrel by being spun over so as to engage in the grooves 7a in the barrel, cement being preferably run into the groove to complete the sealing of the fuse. As an alternative ix) the spacing member 2 utilised in constructing the fuse of Figure 1, a spacing member of the form shown in Figures 4 and 5 may he employed, said member in this form comprising disc 12, prefmably of ceramic material, having plurality of oireularly distributed apertures 12 spaced at equal intervals around the axis of the disc and a central aperture 12c, such apertures being intended to function in corresponding manner o that described for the apertures "2a and 2c in the spacing member 2 of Figures 2 and 3. In Figures 6 and 7, t 15 is indicated a metal disc which will correspond to the end-plate 5 of Figure 1, being formed with three radially spaced raws 15a, 15b an4 15c. each consisting of a plurality of circularly distributed apertures, through which will extend the backing attachments and resistance wires of fuse for attachment to said end-plato, as described in respect of Figure 1.
