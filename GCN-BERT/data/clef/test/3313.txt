HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS AS NAV CHANNEL INHIBITORS AND USES THEREOF RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application 61/945,227, filed on February 27, 2014, the contents of which are herein incorporated in its entirety by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to heterocyclic compounds that are useful as inhibitors of NaV1.6. The invention also provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions comprising compounds of the present invention and methods of using said compositions in the treatment of various disorders. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Mechanistics studies on white matter damage have shown that exposure of axons to hypoxia leads to excessive sodium influx and a consequent inverse functioning of the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) that ultimately triggers activation of calcium-mediated cell death cascades. Experimentally, this idea is supported by a large body of experimental observations including that blocking of sodium channels with Tetrodotoxin (TTX) or saxitosin, blocking of the NCX (with bepridil, benzamil, dichlorobenzamil) or manipulation of the transmembrane sodium gradient by substituting Na+ with Li+ or choline can all protect axons against anoxic injury. Conversely, increasing sodium channel permeability during anoxia with veratridine resulted in greater injury. Under hypoxic conditions, the availability of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) within is axoplasm becomes limited not only due to decrease synthesis but also due to the increased demands from the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+-ATPase) for extruding exceeding sodium. It has also been shown that in an inflammatory milieu, where nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by phagocytic cells such as macrophages and microglia, the availability of ATP is diminished by the damage that this mediators can directly cause on mitochondria, particularly on enzymes involved in the synthesis of ATP itself. Through this mechanism, NO donors can exacerbate the axonal damage induced by hypoxia. Indeed, in multiple sclerosis, where a persistent sodium current is hypothesized to overload demyelinated axons and where the synthesis of ATP is affected by NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the inflammatory nature of this disease, any initial Na+ overload cannot be overcome and creates a vicious cycle, causing reverse functioning of the NCX which in turn activates Ca+2-mediated cell cascades including the increased synthesis of NO, which besides impairing ATP synthesis itself, in addition to triggering axonal degeneration and apoptosis by multiple known mechanisms. This aspect of the pathology of multiple sclerosis is well documented in the literature and has been named virtual hypoxia. [0004] In line with the hypothesis of the association of sodium overload and axonal degeneration in multiple sclerosis are the observations of increased total sodium content in the advanced stage of relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis, especially in the normal-appearing brain tissues by using sodium 23 (23Na) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Sodium channel blockers such as Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Flecainide and Lamotrigine are well established drugs and are indicated for different conditions such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain and arrhythmia. All these compound have one feature in common, i.e., they are all state-dependent sodium channel blockers, meaning that they do not affect the normal functioning of sodium channels, but do so particularly in pathological states where higher than normal neuronal firing increases the proportion of channels that are found at any time point in a conformational configuration called inactivated state. This is crucial for the safety of these drugs given that action potentials in the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS) and axons are conducted by voltage-gated sodium channels. [0005] All of the above mentioned examples of VGSC blockers have been tested in EAE and have in general been shown to improve clinical scores, ameliorate the axonal loss and demyelination associated with disease and revert the loss in axonal conductivity in the spinal cord of the test animals. Voltage-gated sodium channel blockers also exhibit a protective effect in other disease models including spinal cord injury which is a relevant CNS injury model. Collectively, the body of evidence discussed above was convincing enough to raise interest within the scientific community to test the efficacy of VGSC as neuroprotective agents and Lamotrigine was tested in a randomised, double -blind phase II clinical trial for neuroprotection in secondary progressive MS patients and Lamotrigine treatment reduced the deterioration of the timed 25-foot walk (p=0.02) over 2 years. [0006] Two voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) isoforms namely Navl.2 and Navl.6 have been shown to be overexpressed in post-morten tissue from multiple sclerosis patients and in different animal models mimicking the disease and that are collectively known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Amongst neurons overexpressing VGSC, those overexpressing Navl.6 are more frequently co-localized with the degeneration marker β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) than those overexpressing Navl.2. Indeed, it has long been known that axons selectively expressing Navl.2 are extremely resistant to anoxic injury. This is likely related to the electrophysiological properties of this channel: Navl.2 shows greater accumulation of inactivation at high frequencies of stimulation while producing smaller persistent currents in comparison with Navl.6. On the other hand, Navl.6 produces large persistent currents that may play a role in triggering reverse functioning of the NCX which can injure demyelinated axons where Navl.6 and the NCX are co-localized. Collectively, this evidence indicates that the Navl.6 isoform mediates axonal degeneration in multiple sclerosis.

Unless otherwise stated, all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are within the scope of the invention. [0036] Additionally, unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures including the replacement of hydrogen by deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a 13C- or 14C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention. In some embodiments, the group comprises one or more deuterium atoms. [0037] There is furthermore intended that a compound of the formula I includes isotope- labeled forms thereof. An isotope-labeled form of a compound of the formula I is identical to this compound apart from the fact that one or more atoms of the compound have been replaced by an atom or atoms having an atomic mass or mass number which differs from the atomic mass or mass number of the atom which usually occurs naturally. Examples of isotopes which are readily commercially available and which can be incorporated into a compound of the formula I by well- known methods include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phos-phorus, fluo-rine and chlorine, for example 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 180, 170, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F and 36CI, respectively. A compound of the formula I, a prodrug, thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of either which contains one or more of the above-mentioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms is intended to be part of the present invention. An isotope-labeled compound of the formula I can be used in a number of beneficial ways. For example, an isotope-labeled compound of the formula I into which, for example, a radioisotope, such as 3H or 14C, has been incorporated, is suitable for medicament and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. These radioisotopes, i.e. tritium (3H) and carbon- 14 (14C), are particularly preferred owing to simple preparation and excellent detectability. Incorporation of heavier isotopes, for example deuterium (2H), into a compound of the formula I has therapeutic advantages owing to the higher metabolic stability of this isotope-labeled compound. Higher metabolic stability translates directly into an increased in vivo half-life or lower dosages, which under most circumstances would represent a preferred embodiment of the present invention. An isotope-labeled compound of the formula I can usually be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the synthesis schemes and the related description, in the example part and in the preparation part in the present text, replacing a non-isotope-labeled reactant by a readily available isotope-labeled reactant. [0038] Deuterium (2H) can also be incorporated into a compound of the formula I for the purpose in order to manipulate the oxidative metabolism of the compound by way of the primary kinetic isotope effect. The primary kinetic isotope effect is a change of the rate for a chemical reaction that results from exchange of isotopic nuclei, which in turn is caused by the change in ground state energies necessary for covalent bond formation after this isotopic exchange. Exchange of a heavier isotope usually results in a lowering of the ground state energy for a chemical bond and thus causes a reduction in the rate in rate-limiting bond breakage. If the bond breakage occurs in or in the vicinity of a saddle-point region along the coordinate of a multi- product reaction, the product distribution ratios can be altered substantially. For explanation: if deuterium is bonded to a carbon atom at a non-exchangeable position, rate differences of kM/kD = 2-7 are typical. If this rate difference is successfully applied to a corn-pound of the formula I that is susceptible to oxidation, the profile of this compound in vivo can be drastically modified and result in improved pharmacokinetic properties. [0039] When discovering and developing therapeutic agents, the person skilled in the art is able to optimize pharmacokinetic parameters while retaining desirable in vitro properties. It is reasonable to assume that many compounds with poor pharmacokinetic profiles are susceptible to oxidative metabolism. In vitro liver microsomal assays currently available provide valuable information on the course of oxidative metabolism of this type, which in turn permits the rational design of deuterated compounds of the formula I with improved stability through resistance to such oxidative metabolism. Significant improvements in the pharmacokinetic profiles of compounds of the formula I are thereby obtained, and can be expressed quantitatively in terms of increases in the in vivo half-life (t/2), concentration at maximum therapeutic effect (Cmax), area under the dose response curve (AUC), and F; and in terms of reduced clearance, dose and materials costs. [0040] The following is intended to illustrate the above: a compound of the formula I which has multiple potential sites of attack for oxidative metabolism, for example benzylic hydrogen atoms and hydrogen atoms bonded to a nitrogen atom, is prepared as a series of analogues in which various combinations of hydrogen atoms are replaced by deuterium atoms, so that some, most or all of these hydrogen atoms have been replaced by deuterium atoms. Half-life determinations enable favorable and accurate determination of the extent of the extent to which the improvement in resistance to oxidative metabolism has improved. In this way, it is determined that the half-life of the parent compound can be extended by up to 100% as the result of deuterium-hydrogen exchange of this type. [0041] Deuterium-hydrogen exchange in a compound of the formula I can also be used to achieve a favorable modification of the metabolite spectrum of the starting compound in order to diminish or eliminate undesired toxic metabolites. For example, if a toxic metabolite arises through oxidative carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond cleavage, it can reasonably be assumed that the deuterated analogue will greatly diminish or eliminate production of the unwanted metabolite, even if the particular oxidation is not a rate-determining step. Further information on the state of the art with respect to deuterium-hydrogen exchange may be found, for example in Hanzlik et al., J. Org. Chem. 55, 3992-3997, 1990, Reider et al., J. Org.

[00103] Most preferably, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention are formulated for oral administration. Such formulations may be administered with or without food. In some embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention are administered without food. In other embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention are administered with food. [00104] The amount of compounds of the present invention that are optionally combined with the carrier materials to produce a composition in a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated, the particular mode of administration. Preferably, provided compositions should be formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day of the compound can be administered to a patient receiving these compositions. [00105] It should also be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating physician and the severity of the particular disease being treated. The amount of a compound of the present invention in the composition will also depend upon the particular compound in the composition. Uses of Compounds and Pharmaceutically Acceptable Compositions [00106] In certain embodiments, the invention provides a method for inhibiting or antagonizing NaV1.6 in a patient or in a biological sample comprising the step of administering to said patient or contacting said biological sample with a compound according to the invention. [00107] In certain embodiments, the invention is directed to the use of compounds of the invention and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof, for modulating or inhibiting/antagonziging NaV1.6. The term "modulation" denotes any change in NaV1.6- mediated signal transduction, which is based on the action of the specific inventive compounds capable to interact with the NaV1.6 target in such a manner that makes recognition, binding and activating possible. The compounds are characterized by such a high affinity to NaVl .6. In certain embodiments, the substances are highly selective for NaV1.6 over most other channels in order to guarantee an exclusive and directed recognition with the single NaV1.6 target. In the context of the present invention, the term "recognition" - without being limited thereto - relates to any type of interaction between the specific compounds and the target, particularly covalent or non-covalent binding or association, such as a covalent bond, hydrophobic/ hydrophilic interactions, van der Waals forces, ion pairs, hydrogen bonds, ligand-receptor (enzyme-inhibitor) interactions, and the like. Such association may also encompass the presence of other molecules such as peptides, proteins or nucleotide sequences. The present ion channel interaction is characterized by high affinity, high selectivity and minimal or even lacking cross-reactivity to other target molecules to exclude unhealthy and harmful impacts to the treated subject. [00108] In certain embodiments, the present invention relates to a method for inhibiting or antagonizing NaV1.6, with at least one compound of formula (I) according to the invention and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof, under conditions such that said NaV1.6 is inhibited/antagonozied.

In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention are administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg and preferably from about 1 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. [00144] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms optionally contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. [00145] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions are formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation are also a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S. P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. [00146] Injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial- retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. [00147] In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This is accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide- polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues. [00148] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. [00149] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar— agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form also optionally comprises buffering agents. [00150] Solid compositions of a similar type are also employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type are also employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like. [00151] The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms optionally also comprise buffering agents. They optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. [00152] Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.
