The compositions further include superior foams where the flexible polyurethane injection molded foam has: a vertical rebound, as measured by ASTM D2632, of at least 30%; a compression set at room temperature, as measured by ASTM D395, of no more than 25%>; a compression set at 50 °C, as measured by ASTM D395, of no more than 50%>; and an Asker C hardness, as measured by ASTM D2240, of from 30 to 65, or from 40 to 65, or from 44 to 65. Also provided are processes of making the same and articles made from the same. BACKGROUND [0002] This technology relates to flexible polyurethane injection molded foam, processes of making the same, and articles made from the same. [0003] Flexible polyurethane foams are well recognized articles of commerce. Flexible polyurethane foams are used in a wide variety of applications, ranging from cushioning (such as mattresses, pillows and seat cushions) to packaging to thermal insulation. Polyurethane foams insulate, float, cushion, glue, clothe and absorb sound, among many other applications. Polyurethanes, defined as polymeric substances having multiple urethane linkages, are a large family of polymers with widely ranging properties and uses. The types and properties of polyurethanes are so varied that the Alliance for the Polyurethanes Industry (Arlington, Va.) has dubbed them the "erector set" of the plastics industry. Types of polyurethanes include rigid and flexible foams; thermoplastic polyurethane; and other miscellaneous types, such as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. Flexible foams (e.g., that found in most car seat cushions) are generally open-celled materials, while rigid foams (e.g., building insulation) usually have a high proportion of closed cells. [0004] While there is growing interest in using flexible polyurethane foams in an ever increasing range of applications, it can be difficult to find polyurethane materials that foam well, and even once such materials are identified it can be very difficult to find polyurethane materials that when foamed provide the physical properties needed for specific applications. [0005] Therefore, there is a need for flexible polyurethane injection molded foams which have acceptable foam processing properties, and in some embodiments, acceptable balances between the properties of vertical rebound, compression set at room temperature, compression set at elevated temperature and hardness.

[0026] The polyurethane formed by the described reaction system, and which has the described properties, is well suited to be processed into a flexible polyurethane foam. Many polyurethanes are not so well suited and form poor foams, or even no foams at all. In some embodiments, the flexible polyurethane foams described herein may include two or more polyurethanes made from two or more reaction systems. The described reaction system and resulting polyurethane may of course only apply to one of the polyurethanes present in such systems, but in some embodiments they could apply to both independently. Further, it is noted that crosslinking agents and similar materials may be used with the polyurethanes described herein, however, the properties of the polyurethanes, including their weight average molecular weight and dispersity, are in regards to the materials before any crosslinking agents or similar materials are applied, unless otherwise noted. [0027] The disclosed technology provides for the described flexible polyurethane injection molded foams where the foam has: (i) a peak temperature of crystallization, as measured by DSC, between 40 °C and 205 °C, or even 42 to 204, 70 to 120, 78 to 100, or even 79 to 100 °C; (ii) a peak temperature of melting, as measured by DSC, between 106 °C and 206 °C, or even from 132 to 206, 135 to 206, 138 to 182, or even 138 to 168 °C; (iii) a difference between the peak temperature of melting and the peak temperature of crystallization, each as measured by DSC, between 1 degree and 137 degrees, or even from 1.9 to 105, 24 to 104, or even 48 to 70 degrees; and (iv) a melt strength, as measured by Rheoten, between 0.003 and 0.6 N, or even from 0.003 to 0.6, 0.004 to 0.6, 0.04 to 0.5, or even 0.04 to 0.2 N.

Unless otherwise noted, all molecular weight values are weight average molecular weight and may be measured by GPC. [0097] It is known that some of the materials described above may interact in the final formulation, so that the components of the final formulation may be different from those that are initially added. For instance, metal ions (of, e.g., a flame retardant) can migrate to other acidic or anionic sites of other molecules.

Nevertheless, all such modifications and reaction products are included within the scope of the technology described herein; the technology described herein encompasses the composition prepared by admixing the components described above. EXAMPLES [0098] The technology described herein may be better understood with reference to the following non-limiting examples. [0099] A series of polyurethanes are prepared and then foamed to evaluate their foam processing properties. The resulting foam samples are then tested further to evaluate their physical properties and how suitable they are for various end use applications, that is whether the balance good foam processing properties with good physical properties. [0100] The table below summarizes the formulations of the polyurethanes tested. TABLE 1 [0101] Example E is included as a baseline material. This example is representative of TPU that is commercially available for use in the preparation of injection molded foams. The foams of this invention provide processing improvements of foams made from these type of TPU as well as improved performance properties in the resulting foam. [0102] Each of the polyurethanes described in Table 1 above is plasticized by the thermal energy, which is provided by a heated barrel and shear energy by screw rotation within the barrel. Once the polyurethane is fully plasticized within the barrel, a physical blowing agent, in a super critical fluid state, is directly injected into the barrel and solubilized into the plasticized polyurethane. The injected physical blowing agent and molten polyurethane are homogenized via rotation of a screw which has specially designed mixing sections. A set volume of the homogenized blowing agent and polyurethane mixture is then injected into a confined mold. During the injection stage, the blowing agent and polyurethane mixture starts its initial foaming process. When the injection is completed, the pressure of the mold is released and secondary foaming takes place, resulting in a flexible polyurethane injection molded foam. [0103] As each polyurethane material is foamed it is rated on its foam processing properties. A summary of these ratings is presented in the table below where the ratings range from 0 to 10 with a 0 indicating untestable performance and a 10 indicating the best possible performance. The areas where the samples are rated included shot to shot consistency of the material, sample uniformity, surface quality of the resulting foam, the expansion capability of the material, and the foam structure focusing on uniformity of voids and the lack of large voids. TABLE 2 Example Shot-to -shot Sample Surface quality Expansion Foam structure consistency uniformity capability Inv 6 2 3 5 3 Inv S 8 4 9 2 4 Inv T 9 9 5 5 8 [0104] The results show that the polyurethane materials of the invention have very good foam processing properties compared to other polyurethane materials. In other words, the inventive examples have better overall ratings than the comparative examples in one or more areas while having at least comparable ratings in the other areas evaluated. Some examples have better ratings across all areas evaluated. The flexible polyurethane foams made from a reaction system that includes at least one polyol, at least one isocyanate, and at least one chain extender where the polyurethane has: (a) a weight average molecular weight of 120,000 to 500,000, and (b) a dispersity (Mw/Mn) of 1.85 to 2.51 , show better overall ratings in there foam processing properties compared to the other materials, and particularly compared to the baseline material. [0105] Each polyurethane material that can be processed into flexible polyurethane foam is then tested to evaluate its physical properties. A summary of these results is presented in the table below, which includes the melting temperature of the TPU, Tm, the crystallization temperature of the TPU, Tc, and the difference between the two values, delta (Tm-Tc), all measured by DSC, and compression set (CS) at room temperature (RT) and 50 °C by ASTM D395.
