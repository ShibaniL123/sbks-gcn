DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS The following discussion of the embodiments of an organizing device with flexible ties is merely exemplary in nature and in no way is intended to limit the organizing devices or its applications or uses. Many people have a need for a simple organizing device for holding small items. One example is the need to hold keys and sunglasses in a convenient location around a home. Another example, particularly relevant with the proliferation of personal electronic devices, is the need to organize charging cords—that is, to keep the plugs from falling on the floor, while still allowing the cords to move freely—around a desk, in a car, or elsewhere. An organizing device as disclosed herein could serve these functions. Modern materials and manufacturing processes make it possible to design an organizing device which meets the need described above, while at the same time being inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible in mounting configuration. Three different embodiments of an organizing device are described and shown in this disclosure. Other embodiments are also possible. FIG. 1 is an illustration of a first embodiment of an organizing device 10. Shown in FIG. 1 are a body piece 12, a plurality of rubberized twist ties 14, a light 16, and a mounting tab 18. In the first embodiment, the body piece 12 is hemispherical in shape and is a single piece of molded rubber. The body piece 12 is a fairly thin shell, generally hollow on the inside, as will be discussed in detail below. The rubberized twist ties 14 are incorporated into the design of the organizing device 10, allowing a user to secure any number of different types of items to the outside of the body piece 12. In the figures, three of the rubberized twist ties 14 are shown, where both ends of each of the rubberized twist ties 14 protrude from the body piece 12, and a central portion of each of the rubberized twist ties 14 passes through the interior of the body piece 12. In practice, more or fewer than three of the rubberized twist ties 14 could be used. Thus, the user has the flexibility to use as many of the rubberized twist ties 14 as desired and configure them as needed. The rubberized twist ties 14 are of a style which is commonly available on the market, comprised of a metal wire encased in rubber. The light 16 optionally may be included in the organizing device 10 as a convenience feature, with a location off-center in the body piece 12 being shown. The light 16 also, of course, could be placed in the center of the body piece 12. The light 16 most preferably would have a low physical profile, low energy consumption properties, and low heat generation. A small light emitting diode (LED) for the light 16 is envisioned as a preferred embodiment. A switch (not shown) could be built into the light 16 or placed adjacent to it. A small battery (not shown) could also be built into the light 16, or could be provided anywhere in or on the organizing device 10 as appropriate. The mounting tab 18 allows a screw (not shown) to be used to semi-permanently attach the organizing device 10 to a surface. The mounting tab 18 and screw would be suitable for use in a situation where a user wants to mount the organizing device 10 in a certain location and leave it there—such as near a door in a home, where the organizing device 10 would be used to hold items such as keys and sunglasses. Other attachment methods, discussed below, would obviate the need for the mounting tab 18 in some situations. In one configuration of the organizing device 10, the body portion 12 has a diameter of about 3 inches. Larger or smaller designs may also be suitable for some purposes. FIG. 2 is an exploded view illustration of the first embodiment of the organizing device 10 of FIG. 1, showing how the body piece 12, a back piece 20, and an assortment of attachment devices are assembled. As mentioned above, the body piece 12, which is seen from below in FIG. 2, is molded of a firm but flexible rubber material and is generally hollow on the interior. A back piece 20, preferably molded of a hard plastic, fits in the opening in the bottom of the body piece 12, thus enclosing the organizing device 10. The body piece 12 includes several holes 22, with two of the holes 22 needed for each of the rubberized twist ties 14. One of the rubberized twist ties 14 is shown threaded through two of the holes 22 in FIG. 2. The holes 22 may be just large enough in diameter for the tips of the rubberized twist ties 14 to pass through. In order to hold the rubberized twist ties 14 securely in position in the organizing device 10, the body piece 12 further includes a plurality of bosses 24. In this embodiment, three of the bosses 24 are included to support the three rubberized twist ties 14. Each of the bosses 24 includes a channel 26, designed such that one of the rubberized twist ties 14 can fit down into the channel 26. The back piece 20 includes a ring rib 28 of a diameter designed to align with the channels 26 in the three bosses 24. Thus, when the back piece 20 is inserted into the opening in the bottom of the body piece 12, the ring rib 28 presses against the rubberized twist ties 14, holding them securely in position in the channels 26. Details of the fit of the back piece 20 into the body piece 12 are shown in FIG. 3 and discussed below. Although the organizing device 10 could sit freely on a horizontal surface, such as a desk, it is expected that in most applications the user will want to attach the organizing device 10 to some surface. A variety of attachment devices are included for this purpose. A suction cup 30 would be suitable for attachment of the organizing device 10 to very smooth surfaces, such as glass and metal. A portion of the suction cup 30 would be inserted through a hole 32 in the back piece 20, such that the suction cup 30 is operable to hold the bottom of the organizing device 10 against the desired surface. Other attachment devices include mating pieces of hook-and-loop fastener material 34, foam tape 36, and a magnet 38. The hole 32 in the back piece 20 would not be needed for the hook-and-loop fastener material 34, the foam tape 36, and the magnet 38, as they would all be affixed to the back piece 20 via tape or some other adhesive. Thus, for the attachment devices 34-38, the hole 32 could be omitted from the back piece 20, or the attachment devices 34-38 simply could be placed over and cover the hole 32. The hook-and-loop fastener material 34, being comprised of two detachable pieces, could be used to provide a firm attachment of the organizing device 10 to a surface while still allowing the organizing device 10 to be removed as needed. The foam tape 36 would provide a semi-permanent attachment of the organizing device 10 to a surface. The magnet 38, of course, would provide a firm yet relocatable attachment of the organizing device 10 to a ferrous metal object. Using the hook-and-loop fastener material 34 or the foam tape 36, it would be possible to stick two of the organizing devices 10 together back to back to make a ball. The mounting tab 18 ordinarily would not be needed when one of the attachment devices (30, 34-38) is used. In this situation, the mounting tab 18 could remain attached to the organizing device 10 and unused, or the mounting tab 18 could be removed from the organizing device 10 by the user. The organizing device 10 thus would be assembled as follows. From the interior of the body piece 12, the rubberized twist ties 14 would first be inserted through the holes 22, while pressing a central portion of each of the rubberized twist ties 14 into one of the channels 26 in the bosses 24. One of the attachment devices (30, 34-38) would be selected and affixed to the back piece 20. The back piece 20 then would be inserted into the body piece 12, thus forming a complete enclosed assembly and holding the rubberized twist ties 14 securely in position. FIG. 3 is a section view of the first embodiment of the organizing device 10 of FIGS. 1 and 2, showing how the back piece 20 fits into the body piece 12. The body piece 12 is formed with a groove 40 running around the periphery of its interior surface, along the lower inside edge. Outer edge 42 of the back piece 20 fits in the groove 40, thus holding the back piece 20 in place in the body piece 12. As mentioned previously, the body piece 12 is formed of a firm yet flexible rubber, and the back piece 20 is molded of a hard plastic. The body piece 12 would have to be flexed in order to insert the back piece 20. Once the back piece 20 is squeezed in place in the groove 40, the body piece 12 would return to its nominal shape and assembly would be complete. FIG. 4 is an illustration of the first embodiment of the organizing device 10 of FIGS. 1-3, shown in a typical usage. In the application shown in FIG. 4, the organizing device 10 might be attached to a side of a desk in a dormitory room, where the organizing device 10 could be used to hold a charging cord 52 in place and to hang a set of keys 54. The configurability of the rubberized twist ties 14 allows almost unlimited possibilities for what can be done with the organizing device 10. FIG. 5 is an illustration of another embodiment of an organizing device 80. The organizing device 80 is a semi-cylindrical shape for applications where a more linear layout is needed. Of course, the cross sectional shape of the organizing device 80 need not be exactly as shown in FIG. 5. Many variations are possible, while still providing a substantially different form factor than the organizing device 10 discussed previously. The organizing device 80 is comprised of a body piece 82 and a back piece 84 which are assembled in a fashion similar to that shown for the body piece 12 and the back piece 20 of the organizing device 10. That is, the body piece 82 preferably would be constructed of a rubber material which could be flexed to allow the back piece 84 to be inserted into a groove running along the lower inside edge of the body piece 82. The body piece 82 could similarly include bosses on its interior for capturing the rubberized twist ties 14 and holding them in position. In the organizing device 80 shown in FIG. 5, three of the rubberized twist ties 14 are shown protruding through holes 86 which run along the center line of the body piece 82. In practice, other hole patterns could be provided, such as two adjacent rows of the holes 86 or a staggered hole pattern, and more than three of the rubberized twist ties 14 could be used. Similarly, the body piece 82 in FIG. 5 has the holes 86 unevenly spaced in pairs, but this is not mandatory. As discussed previously, the ability to insert the rubberized twist ties 14 into the holes 86 in different arrangements gives the user the flexibility to use as many of the rubberized twist ties 14 as desired, and to configure them as needed. The organizing device 80 preferably also would include a mounting tie wrap 90 which could be wrapped around a tree branch or a post to secure the device 80 in an ad hoc fashion. This type of attachment of the device 80 would be advantageous for a hunter in a tree, or a fisherman on a pier, for example, where the device 80 could be mounted using the mounting tie wrap 90 and then small objects, such as game calls or lures, could be secured by the twist ties 14. The rubber and plastic construction of the device 80 would allow it to flex somewhat to conform to the shape of a tree branch or post when mounted with the mounting tie wrap 90. The mounting tie wrap 90 preferably would be of a heavier construction than the twist ties 14, would be removable from the organizing device 80 when not needed, and could be secured in place within the device 80 via a mounting boss feature as disclosed for the organizing device 10 and shown in FIG. 2. The organizing device 80, being more linear and elongated in shape than the organizing device 10, also may be particularly well suited to usage on a desk, where it can serve to hold charging cords and power cords in position, keeping the cords organized and preventing the cords from falling on the floor. To this end, the organizing device 80 is shown in FIG. 5 securing cords 92, 94 and 96—keeping the plugs in a convenient location while still allowing the cords 92-96 to be extended as needed. The organizing device 80 also may be used for holding keys and sunglasses, keeping these items separated, visible, and organized. The organizing device 80 would include attachment devices equivalent to those shown in FIG. 2 for the organizing device 10. Two of each of the suction cup 30, the hook-and-loop fastener material 34, the foam tape 36, and the magnet 38 would be used to support the longer shape of the organizing device 80. In a preferred embodiment, the organizing device 80 would have a length of 6 to 8 inches. The cross-section of the organizing device 80 would be about an inch and a half in width and height. Other sizes, larger or smaller, of course are possible and may be desirable for certain applications. In another design embodiment, an organizing device 100 could be made in a single-piece construction, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7. FIG. 6 is an isometric view of the organizing device 100 which, like the organizing device 80, has an elongated shape. The organizing device 100 preferably would be made of a rubber material to allow flexing, would include several of the rubberized twist ties 14 for use as described previously, and would include the attachment devices 34-38. The organizing device 100 also includes the mounting tie wrap 90, which passes through holes 102 formed in each end of the device 100. The mounting tie wrap 90, if not needed, can be removed from the holes 102. FIG. 7 is a bottom view of the organizing device 100, showing several design features. Holes 104 are arranged in pairs, with each pair of the holes 104 encompassed by a recess 106. Both ends of one of the rubberized twist ties 14 can be inserted into a pair of the holes 104 from the bottom, such that the ends of the rubberized twist tie 14 protrude out of the top of the device 100 as shown in FIG. 6, while the middle portion of the rubberized twist tie 14 lies within the recess 106. The organizing device 100 shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 includes three pairs of the holes 104, but more or fewer are possible depending on the length of the device 100. Cavities 108 may also be included to reduce weight and material consumption, and also to increase the flexibility of the organizing device 100. A decorative button 112 could be added to the rubberized twist ties 14 used with any of the organizing devices 10, 80, or 100. To apply the decorative button 112 to the rubberized twist tie 14, cap 110 would first have to be removed. In one design embodiment, the decorative button 112 could be a flat two-dimensional shape with a hole all the way through it, such that the decorative button 112 is slid onto the rubberized twist tie 14 with a slight interference fit, and then the cap 110 is replaced on the end of the rubberized twist tie 14. In another design embodiment, the decorative button 112 could be a three-dimensional shape with a hole in the bottom of it, such that the decorative button 112 is pressed onto the end of the rubberized twist tie 14, either taking the place of the cap 110, or directly onto the cap 110. Many different applications for the organizing devices 10, 80, or 100 are easily envisioned. The devices 10, 80, or 100 could be used in a car to keep charging cords and audio cords organized. The devices 10, 80, or 100 could be placed on a wall or appliance in a kitchen, where they could be used to hold small kitchen utensils. On a desktop or a computer case, the devices 10, 80, or 100 would be ideal for organizing power cords, as shown in FIG. 5. The devices 10, 80, or 100 also could be placed anywhere there is a need for holding and organizing miscellaneous small items—such as on a wall near a door or on or near a bed. The variety of attachment methods, and the flexibility in placing and shaping the rubberized twist ties 14, allow the organizing devices 10, 80, or 100 to be used for a wide variety of purposes. FIG. 8 shows another embodiment of an organizing device 600. In this embodiment, a single one piece body 610 includes a flat side 615 and a rounded side 620. Flat side 615 may include an adhesive or an adhesive strip, suction cups, or other attachment system. In one alternative, screws (or other attachment mechanisms) may be placed through holes in organizing device 600 to more permanently hold it in place. In another embodiment, the material that composes organizing device 600 may easily be screwed into or hammered into. In rounded side 620, there is a plurality of paired slots 630. A rubberized twist tie 650 may be utilized in each of these slots. Each of the paired slots 630 is slightly less that the width of rubberized twist tie 650, so some friction is experienced; however, the twist ties 650 may still be slid up and down in the slots. In some embodiments, the paired slots 630 may be configured with a looser configuration so that the twist ties 650 are easily slid. Each slot also has a break 640. Break 640 is appropriately sized such that the twist tie 650 may be compressed and pulled out of break 640. The size of the opening 645 at the top and the bottom of each slot 630 is sized such that the twist tie 650 may not be pulled through due to end caps 655. As shown, cords 675 may be held in a variety of fashions. They may be held by pressing the tips 680 together around cord 675. Twist tie 650 may be bent down on a cord 675 that passes through the aperture 686 formed by a twist tie 650 resident in a “U” shape in organizing device 600. As shown in FIG. 9, twist tie 650 may be slid up and down 710 around a cord 675 that passes through aperture 680 engaging the cord 675 with the U-shaped portion 715 of twist tie 650. Although organizing device 600 is shown with a certain number of paired slots, more or fewer slots may be utilized. Also in an alternative, only a single slot may be used, and the twist tie 650 may be wrapped about a cord 675 in order to hold it in place. In another embodiment as shown in FIG. 10, a cord organizer 800 includes a rounded face 810 and an angled face 815. Twist tie 650 is configured to hold power cord 675. Similar to organizing device 600 as discussed in relation to cord organizer 800, angled face 815 has an adhesive to attach it to table 820. In alternatives, other attachment mechanisms may be used such as screws, suction cups, etc. Angled face 815 is selected to mirror the curve or angle of table 820 and is not limited to the angle shown. As shown in FIG. 11, the cord organizer 800 includes a receiver slot 910 for twist tie 650. The opening 911 for raised receiver slot 910 is less than the width of twist tie 650, so that twist tie 650 may be compressed to enter and exit slot 910. Cords 675 may be placed in channels 930. Twist ties 650 exit the body of cord organizer 800 through apertures 920. Apertures 920 are sized so that twist ties 650 may be removed with significant compression of end caps 655. The interior of cord organizer 800 is hollow and, typically, cord organizer 800 is composed of two pieces, a front portion and a back portion. FIG. 12 shows another embodiment of a cord organizer 1000. Similar to the previous embodiments, cord organizer 1000 includes a plurality of twist ties 650 having an aperture 1010 through which cord 675 may be placed. Cord organizer 1000 includes a plurality of paired apertures 1015 in body piece 1020, through which twist ties 650 may be placed by compressing the end cap 655. Each aperture is sized to be slightly less that the width of the end cap, allowing for holding, but also removal by compressing the end cap 655. Alternatively, only a single aperture may be provided. Cord 675 may be secured simply by twisting twist tie 650. As shown in FIG. 13, cord organizer 1000 includes an angled back 1110 for interfacing with surface 1120 and includes a complementary shape. Similar to organizing device 600 as discussed in relation to cord organizer 1000, angled face 1110 has an adhesive to attach it to table 1120. In other alternatives, other attachment mechanisms may be used such as screws, suction cups, etc. In FIG. 14, a labeling window 1210 is shown for labeling what the cords belong to. In FIG. 15 another embodiment of a cord organizer is shown. Twist ties 650 may be placed through apertures 1510 in lower body 1520. Apertures 1510 are sized such that they are wider than the capped ends of twist ties 650. Upper body portion 1530 may be snap fitted into lower body portion 1520.
