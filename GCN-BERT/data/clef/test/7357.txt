(4) Preparation of (2S,5R)-1-(tert-butyl) 2-ethyl 5-(N-(benzyloxy)-2-nitrophenylsulfonamido)piperidine-1,2-dicarboxylate
(2S,5S)-1-(tert-butyl) 2-ethyl 5-hydroxylpiperidine-1,2-dicarboxylate (130 g, 475.62 mmol), triphenylphosphine (212 g, 809.16 mmol) and N-(benzyloxy)-2-nitrophenyl-1-sulfamide (161.4 g, 523.5 mmol) were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (1500 mL), cooled to 0Â°C, diethyl azodicarboxylate (149.1 g, 856.16 mmol) was added dropwise under nitrogen gas protection, after adding, the reaction solution was heated to room temperature and stirred overnight, concentrated, and the crude product was purified by silica gel chromatograph (ethyl acetate : petroleum ether = 1:5) to obtain the title compound as a yellow oil (210 g, yield 78%).
