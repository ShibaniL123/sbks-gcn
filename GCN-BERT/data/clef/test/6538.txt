RELATED DOCUMENTS The present application claims the benefit and is a U.S. continuation patent application under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) and claims the right of priority under 35 U.S.C. 365 to international patent Application No. PCT/EP2012/073025, filed Nov. 20, 2012, entitled “SUBSTANCE FOR DYEING KERATIN FIBERS, INCLUDING CATIONIC ANTHRAQUINONE DYES AND FATTY ACID TRIGLYCERIDES” which claims benefit of German application No.: 102011089220.6, filed Dec. 20, 2011, these applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present specification relates generally to agents for coloring and optionally simultaneously lightening keratinic fibers. More specifically, the present application relates to cosmetic agents including cationic anthraquinone dyes and special fatty acid triglycerides. The present specification also relates to the use of these agents to produce hair colors having increased shine, an intense color result, improved fastness properties and reduced selectivity. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As a general rule, either substantive dyes or oxidation dyes are used for coloring keratinic fibers. Although intense colors with good fastness properties may be obtained with oxidation dyes, the development of the color generally takes place under the influence of oxidizing agents such as H2O2 for example, which in some cases may result in damage to the fiber. Furthermore, some oxidation dye precursors or certain mixtures of oxidation dye precursors may have a sensitizing effect on people with sensitive skin. For temporary colors, coloring or tinting agents are conventionally used which include substantive dyes as the coloring component. These are dye molecules which attach directly to the hair and require no oxidative process to develop the color. Substantive dyes are applied under gentler conditions. The disadvantage of these dyes, however, lies in the fact that the colors often have inadequate fastness properties, in particular with regard to hair washing, but also with respect to external influences, such as sunlight, or reactive environmental chemicals, such as swimming pool water, for example. Such colors are also generally significantly more sensitive to shampooing than oxidative colors, such that an often undesired shift in shade or even a visible decolorization then occurs very much more quickly. Achieving a uniform coloring of hair that has been frequently treated, such as for example bleached or permanently waved hair, where the fiber presents differing degrees of pre-existing damage in the various lengths or variously treated areas, represents a particular challenge in terms of coloring hair with substantive dyes. During the coloring process itself, the coloring agent may exhibit an uneven coloring behavior on hair with differing degrees of pre-existing damage, while repeated hair washing may also cause the dyes to be washed out of the different areas of the hair to varying degrees, resulting in an inconsistent, and hence undesirable color result. In the development of coloring products based on substantive dyes, there is therefore still a particular focus on producing dye formulations having reduced selectivity, meaning that a uniform color result may be achieved on sections of the hair that have varying degrees of pre-existing damage. In particular, this reduced selectivity should still be present not only immediately after the coloring process, but also after repeated hair washes. An object of the present specification is therefore to provide a coloring agent for keratinic fibers, in particular human hair, which, in addition to other positive fastness properties, has in particular a low selectivity (or a good equalizing capacity) and good wash fastness. The colors achieved with the agents according to the present specification should deliver a brilliant and intense color result, both immediately after the coloring process and after repeated hair washes. Following application of the coloring agent, the hair should be uniformly colored, even in cases where the hair exhibits varying degrees of pre-existing damage, wherein this uniformity in the color result should still be present even after repeated hair washes. In the present specification, another object is to provide brilliant and neutral shades in the blue range with the aforementioned advantageous fastness properties, said shades being extremely suitable for matting. In addition, the application of the agents should increase the shine of the hair and prevent the scalp from drying out. The use of cationic anthraquinone dyes in products for coloring keratinic fibers is already known in principle from the prior art, for example from EP 1 006 154 B1 or EP 1 820 826 A1. Furthermore, combinations of cationic anthraquinone dyes with oxidation dye precursors of the developer type are claimed in EP 2 329 809 for the oxidative coloring of hair. Combinations of cationic anthraquinones with special fatty acid triglycerides have not yet been described. During the course of the work leading to the agents of the present disclosure, it was surprisingly found that combinations of cationic anthraquinone dyes and special fatty acid triglycerides lead to colors which achieve the above object to an outstanding degree. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description of the invention and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with this background of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The following detailed description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding background of the invention or the following detailed description of the invention. In the context of the present specification, “keratin-containing fibers,” “keratinic fibers,” or similar terminology is understood to mean all animal hair, for example wool, horsehair, angora hair, fur, feathers and products or textiles manufactured therefrom. The keratinic fibers are, however, preferably human hair. The term “coloring of keratin fibers” in the context of the present specification includes any form of color changing of fibers. It includes in particular the color changes covered by the terms tinting, lightening, bleaching, peroxiding, oxidative coloring, semipermanent coloring, permanent coloring and temporary coloring. It also includes color changes according to the present specification presenting a lighter color result in comparison to the original color, such as, for example, combined coloring and bleaching processes. The agents according to the present specification include the cationic anthraquinone(s) of formula (I) and the fatty acid triglyceride(s) in a cosmetic carrier, preferably in a suitable aqueous, alcoholic or aqueous-alcoholic carrier. For the purposes of hair coloring, such carriers are for example creams, emulsions, gels or surfactant-containing foaming solutions, such as for example shampoos, foam aerosols, foam formulations or other preparations which are suitable for use on the hair. It is also possible, however, for the agents according to the present specification to be integrated into a formulation in powder or tablet form. In the context of the present specification, aqueous-alcoholic solutions are understood to be aqueous solutions including 3 to 70 weight percent (wt. %) of a C1 to C4 alcohol, in particular ethanol or isopropanol. The agents according to the present specification may additionally include further organic solvents, such as for example methoxybutanol, benzyl alcohol, ethyl diglycol or 1,2-propylene glycol. All water-soluble organic solvents are preferred here. The first essential ingredient (a) of the agents according to the present specification is at least one substantive cationic anthraquinone dye of the general formula (I). The substituents R1 to R8 of the compound of formula (I) are described below by way of non-limiting examples: Examples of a C1-C6 alkyl group are the methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, s-butyl and t-butyl, n-pentyl and n-hexyl groups. Propyl, ethyl and methyl are preferred alkyl residues. Examples of a C2-C6 alkenyl group are vinyl, allyl, but-2-enyl, but-3-enyl and isobutenyl, preferred C2-C6 alkenyl residues being vinyl and allyl. Preferred examples of a C1-C6 hydroxyalkyl group are a hydroxymethyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, 3-hydroxypropyl, 4-hydroxybutyl, 5-hydroxypentyl and 6-hydroxyhexyl group; a 2-hydroxyethyl group is particularly preferred. C1-C6 alkoxy groups that are preferred according to the present specification are the methoxy or ethoxy group. Examples of halogen atoms are F, Cl, Br or I atoms, with Br or C1-atoms being most particularly preferred. Preferred examples of C1-C6 alkoxy C2-C6 alkyl groups according to the present specification are the methoxyethyl, ethoxyethyl, methoxypropyl, methoxybutyl, ethoxypropyl, ethoxybutyl and methoxyhexyl group. Examples of a C1-C6 acyl amino group are the acetamide group, the propanamide group and the butanamide group, the acetamide group being preferred. The pyrrolidinium ring, the piperidinium ring, the morpholinium ring and the 1-azepanium ring may be mentioned as preferred examples of a 5-, 6- or 7-membered ring formed from R4, R5 and the quaternary nitrogen atom. Dyes of formula (I) in which R1, R2 and R3, independently of one another, denote hydrogen, halogen, a carboxyl group, a sulfonic acid group, a C1-C6 alkyl group or a C1-C6 alkoxy group deliver particularly intense color results and are therefore preferred. It is furthermore preferable for one of the residues selected from R1, R2 and R3 to denote halogen, a carboxyl group, a sulfonic acid group, a C1-C6 alkyl group or a C1-C6 alkoxy group and for the other two residues selected from R1, R2 and R3 both to denote hydrogen. A preferred example is an agent for coloring, and optionally simultaneously lightening, keratinic fibers, which is characterized in that it includes a compound of formula (I) in which at least one of the residues R1, R2 and/or R3 denotes a C1-C6 alkyl group. In the case of particularly suitable compounds of formula (I), one of the residues selected from R1, R2 and R3 denotes a C1-C6 alkyl group and the other two residues selected from R1, R2 and R3 denote hydrogen. In a most particularly preferred example, R1 and R2 both denote a hydrogen atom and R3 denotes a methyl group. Furthermore, particularly good coloring results are obtained with agents including at least one compound of formula (I) in which the residues R4, R5 and R6, independently of one another, denote a C1-C6 alkyl group or an alkenyl group. In particular, each of the residues R4, R5 and R6 preferably denotes a C1-C6 alkyl group. It is most particularly preferable for R4 and R5 both to denote a methyl group and for R6 to denote a methyl group, an ethyl group or an n-propyl group. It is moreover most particularly preferable for R4 and R5 both to denote a methyl group and for R6 to denote an n-propyl group. In a likewise particularly preferred example, each of the residues R4, R5 and R6 denotes a methyl group. For compounds of formula (I) there is the proviso that at least one of the residues X, Y and Z denotes an N(R7)(R8) group. Colors having good application properties were obtained in particular when compounds of formula (I) were used in which X denotes an N(R7)(R8) group and Y and Z each denote hydrogen. R7 and R8, preferably (and independently of one another) denote hydrogen or a C1-C6 alkyl group. R7 and R8, particularly preferably (also independently of one another) denote hydrogen or a methyl group. Compounds of formula (I) in which both R7 and R8 denote hydrogen have proved to be particularly suitable and are therefore particularly preferred. In the context of the work leading to the agents of the present disclosure it has proved most particularly advantageous for X to denote an NH2 group. A further preferred example is therefore an agent for coloring, and optionally simultaneously lightening, keratinic fibers, which is characterized in that it includes a compound of formula (I) in which at least X denotes an NH2 group. n preferably denotes the numbers 2 or 3 and most particularly preferably the number 3.A− denotes a physiologically acceptable anion. Suitable physiologically acceptable anions are halide, hydrogen sulfate, ½ sulfate, benzene sulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, acetate, citrate, lactate, ½ tartrate, methosulfate (H3COSO3−) or trifluoromethane sulfonate. A− particularly preferably denotes bromide or methosulfate (H3COSO3−), with A− most particularly preferably denoting methosulfate (H3COSO3−). Agents for coloring, and optionally simultaneously lightening, keratinic fibers that are preferred according to the present specification are characterized in that they include at least one compound of the general formula (I) selected from 3-[(4-amino-9,10-dihydro-3-methyl-9,10-dioxo-1-anthracenyl)amino]-N,N,N-trimethyl-1-propanaminium methosulfate3-[(4-amino-9,10-dihydro-3-methyl-9,10-dioxo-1-anthracenyl)amino]-N,N,N-trimethyl-1-propanaminium bromide,3-[(4-amino-9,10-dihydro-3-methyl-9,10-dioxo-1-anthracenyl)amino]-N,N,N-trimethyl-1-propanaminium chloride,3-[(4-amino-9,10-dihydro-3-methyl-9,10-dioxo-1-anthracenyl)amino]-N,N,N-trimethyl-1-propanaminium-p-toluenesulfonate,3-[(4-amino-9,10-dihydro-3-methyl-9,10-dioxo-1-anthracenyl)amino]-N,N,N-trimethyl-1-propanaminium acetate,3-{[9,10-dihydro-4-(methylamino)-9,10-dioxo-1-anthracenyl]amino}-N,N-dimethyl-N-propyl-1-propanaminium methosulfate,3-{[9,10-dihydro-4-(methylamino)-9,10-dioxo-1-anthracenyl]amino}-N,N-dimethyl-N-propyl-1-propanaminium bromide,3-{[9,10-dihydro-4-(methylamino)-9,10-dioxo-1-anthracenyl]amino}-N,N-dimethyl-N-propyl-1-propanaminium chloride,3-{[9,10-dihydro-4-(methylamino)-9,10-dioxo-1-anthracenyl]amino}-N,N-dimethyl-N-propyl-1-propanaminium-p-toluenesulfonate and3-{[9,10-dihydro-4-(methylamino)-9,10-dioxo-1-anthracenyl]amino}-N,N-dimethyl-N-propyl-1-propanaminium acetate. The compound of formula (Ia) has proved to be an ideally suitable compound of formula (I) for achieving the object according to the present specification in which A− denotes a physiologically acceptable anion, preferably methosulfate (H3COSO3−). A further particularly preferred example is therefore an agent for coloring, and optionally simultaneously lightening, keratinic fibers, which is characterized in that it includes as the compound of formula (I) the compound according to formula (Ia), in which A− denotes a physiologically acceptable anion, preferably methosulfate (H3COSO3−). The agents according to the present specification for coloring, and optionally simultaneously lightening, keratin fibers include the compound(s) of formula (I) preferably in amounts above 0.0001 wt. % and below 5 wt. %, relative in each case to the total agent. A preferred example is an agent which includes the compound(s) of formula (I) in an amount of from 0.0001 to 5 wt. %, preferably from 0.005 to 3.5 wt. %, particularly preferably from 0.01 to 2.5 wt. %, in particular from 0.05 to 1.5 wt. %, and in particular preferably from 0.01 to 1.0 wt. %, relative in each case to the total weight of the agent. As the second essential constituent of the formulation (b), the agents according to the present specification include at least one fatty acid triglyceride. In the context of the present specification, a fatty acid triglyceride is understood to be the triester of the trihydric alcohol glycerol with three equivalents of fatty acid. The trihydric alcohol glycerol may be esterified with structurally identical, different fatty acids, or combinations thereof (for example, two identical fatty acids and a third fatty acid that is not identical to the other two). According to the present specification, fatty acids are understood to be saturated or unsaturated, unbranched or branched, unsubstituted or substituted C8-C24 carboxylic acids. Unsaturated fatty acids may be mono- or polyunsaturated. In the case of an unsaturated fatty acid the C≡C double bond(s) thereof may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Particularly suitable representatives of fatty acid triglycerides (b) are encompassed by formula (II): in which: Ra, Rb, Rc independently of one another, denote a saturated or unsaturated, unbranched or branched, unsubstituted or substituted C7-C23 alkyl group. Examples of particularly suitable fatty acid triglycerides are characterized in that at least one of the ester groups is formed from glycerol with a saturated fatty acid. In this context a fatty acid selected from the following is preferably used as the saturated fatty acid: TABLE 1 Exemplary F groups which may provide Ra, Rb and/or Rc. Fatty acid Ra, Rb and/or Rc = F1 Octanoic acid (caprylic acid) —C7H15 F2 Decanoic acid (capric acid) —C9H19 F3 Dodecanoic acid (lauric acid) —C11H23 F4 Tetradecanoic acid (myristic acid) —C13H27 F5 Hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid) —C15H31 F6 Octadecanoic acid (stearic acid) —C17H35 F7 Eicosanoic acid (arachidic acid) —C19H39 F8 Docosanoic acid (behenic acid) —C21H43 F9 Tetracosanoic acid (lignoceric acid) —C23H47 Within this example, it is particularly advantageous for the agent to include a fatty acid triglyceride (b) in which at least one saturated C14-C20 fatty acid forms an ester with glycerol. Particularly preferred compounds of the general formula (II) are thus compounds in which at least one of the residues selected from Ra, Rb and/or Rc denotes a saturated, unbranched or branched, unsubstituted or substituted C13-C19 alkyl group. Compounds of formula (II) in which at least one of the residues selected from Ra, Rb and/or Rc denotes the residue —C13H27 (F4), —C15H31 (F5), —C17H35 (F6) and/or —C19H39 (F7) are most particularly suitable. The fatty acid triglycerides in which at least one of the ester groups is formed starting from glycerol with a mono- or polyunsaturated fatty acid are also extremely suitable. A fatty acid selected from the following is preferably used as the unsaturated fatty acid: TABLE 2 Further exemplary F groups which may provide Ra, Rb and/or Rc. Fatty acid Ra, Rb and/or Rc = F11 Petroselic acid [(Z)-6- octadecenoic acid] F12 Palmitoleic acid [(9Z)- hexadec-9-enoic acid] F13 Oleic acid [(9Z)- octadec-9-enoic acid] F14 Elaidic acid [(9E)- octadec-9-enoic acid] F15 Erucic acid [(13Z)- docos-13-enoic acid] F16 Linoleic acid [(9Z, 12Z)-octadeca-9,12- dienoic acid F17 Linolenic acid [(9Z,12Z,15Z)- octadeca-9,12,15- trienoic acid F18 Elaeostearic acid [(9Z,11E,13E)- octadeca-9,11,13- trienoic acid] F19 Arachidonic acid [(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)- eicosa-5,8,11,14- tetraenoic acid] F20 Nervonic acid [(15Z)- tetracos-15-enoic acid] During the course of the work leading to the agents of the present disclosure, it also proved to be preferable for the coloring agent to include at least one fatty acid triglyceride (b) in which at least one ester bond of glycerol is formed with a mono-, di- or tri-unsaturated C16-C20 fatty acid. It is preferable in particular for at least one of the fatty acids selected from palmitoleic acid (F12), oleic acid (F13), linoleic acid (F16) and/or linolenic acid (F17) to be esterified with glycerol. The fatty acid triglycerides of formula (II) in which at least one of the residues Ra, Rb and/or Rc denotes one of the residues F12, F13, F16 and/or F17 have thus also proved to be particularly advantageous. The fatty acids used to form the esters in the fatty acid triglycerides (b) may also bear one or more substituents. Substituted fatty acids preferably bear one or more substituents selected from a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl group and a C1-C6 alkoxy group. The fatty acids are preferably substituted with a hydroxyl group or a methoxy group. A fatty acid selected from the following is preferably used as the substituted fatty acid: TABLE 3 Additional exemplary F groups which may provide Ra, Rb and/or Rc. Fatty acid Ra, Rb and/or Rc = F21 Ricinoleic acid [(12- hydroxy-(Z)-octadec-9- enoic acid F22 12-Hydroxy-octadecanoic acid Fatty acid triglycerides of formula (II) in which at least one of the residues Ra, Rb and/or Rc denotes one of the residues F21 or F22 are particularly preferred. A further particularly preferred example is therefore an agent for coloring and optionally simultaneously lightening keratinic fibers, which is characterized in that it includes as the fatty acid triglyceride (b) at least one compound of the general formula (II): in which: Ra, Rb, Rc independently of one another, denote a saturated or unsaturated, unbranched or branched, unsubstituted or substituted C7-C23 alkyl group, in which Ra, Rb and/or Rc are preferably selected from —C13H27 (F4), —C15H31 (F5), —C17H35 (F6), —C19H39 (F7) and the residues F12, F13, F16, F17, F21 and F22. A further particularly preferred example is an agent for coloring, and optionally simultaneously lightening, keratinic fibers, which is characterized in that it includes as the fatty acid triglyceride (b) at least one compound of the general formula (II) in which at least one of the residues Ra, Rb and/or Rc denotes a mono- or polyunsaturated C14-C20 alkyl group, which may optionally be substituted with at least one functional group. Preferably, Ra, Rb and/or Rc denotes a hydroxyl group-substituted C14-C20 alkyl group. In one example of the present specification, the agent includes as the fatty acid triglyceride (b) at least one triester of glycerol and three structurally identical fatty acids. In a further example of the present specification the agent according to the present specification includes as the fatty acid triglyceride (b) at least one triester of glycerol with two different fatty acids. Agents according to the present specification including a fatty acid triglyceride (b) obtained by esterification of three different fatty acids with glycerol have likewise proved advantageous with respect to the application properties of the coloring agent. The triesters are preferably selected from glycerol and the fatty acids disclosed with compound numbers 1 to 863 in the table on pages 13 to 38 of the priority document (DE 102011089220.6, incorporated herein by reference above). For example, the structure of fatty acid triglyceride no. 863 in the table of the priority document is composed of glycerol and the fatty acid residues Ra=F22, Rb=F21 and Rc=F17, resulting in structure (II863). The structures of all further derivatives may be derived in the same way. In a further most particularly preferred example, mixtures of different fatty acid triglycerides (b) are used. It has been found that oils and/or fats whose triglyceride fraction has a special fatty acid distribution meet the requirements for these active ingredients to a special degree. Particularly suitable mixtures of fatty acid triglycerides (b) in this context are above all the mixtures in which the compositions include glycerol and various fatty acids correspond to naturally occurring oils and fats. The triglycerides or mixtures thereof derived from soybean oil, groundnut oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, macadamia nut oil, moringa oil, apricot kernel oil, marula oil and/or castor oil which may be optionally hydrogenated are particularly suitable for use in the agents according to the present specification. Soybean oil includes a mixture of triglycerides bearing fatty acids selected from palmitic acid (F5), stearic acid (F6), oleic acid (F13), linoleic acid (F16) and linolenic acid (F17). As the use of soybean oil in the agents according to the present specification has proved to be particularly advantageous for producing intense and caring colors, mixtures of fatty acid glycerides of formula (II) in which the residues Ra, Rb and/or Rc denote F5, F6, F13 and/or F17 are particularly suitable. Brilliant and intense colors having a particular care effect and particularly good wash fastness were also obtained using groundnut oil in the agents according to the present specification. Groundnut oil includes a mixture of triglycerides wherein the esterified fatty acids are principally composed of palmitic acid (F5), stearic acid (F6), behenic acid (F8), lignoceric acid (F9), oleic acid (F13) and linoleic acid (F16), which are esterified with glycerol. Thus agents including a mixture of fatty acid glycerides of formula (II) in which the residues Ra, Rb and/or Rc denote fatty acid residues selected from F5, F6, F8, F9, F13 and F16 are also extremely suitable. Coloring results with outstanding wash fastness and care performance were likewise obtained using olive oil in the coloring agents according to the present specification. Olive oil includes fatty acid triglycerides wherein the esterified fatty acids are primarily myristic acid (F4), palmitic acid (F5), oleic acid (F13) and linoleic acid (F16). Coloring agents including a mixture of fatty acid triglycerides of formula (II) in which the residues Ra, Rb and/or Rc are selected from F4, F5, F13 and/or F16 have therefore likewise proved to be preferred in the context of the present specification. Sunflower oil is likewise particularly suitable for use in the coloring agents according to the present specification. Sunflower oil mainly includes fatty acid triglycerides wherein the esterified fatty acids are primarily palmitic acid (F5), stearic acid (F6), oleic acid (F13) and linoleic acid (F16). Mixtures of fatty acid triglyceride esters (b) of formula (II) are thus particularly preferred in which the residues Ra, Rb and/or Rc are selected from F5, F6, F13 and F16. The use of macadamia nut oil in the agents according to the present specification is moreover very suitable for producing stable, particularly wash-fast, caring and high-shine colors. In the fatty acid triglycerides of macadamia nut oil, the esterified fatty acids are primarily linoleic acid (F16), palmitic acid (F5), arachidic acid (F7), and stearic acid (F6). Thus mixtures of fatty acid triglyceride esters (b) of formula (II) in which Ra, Rb and/or Rc are selected from the fatty acid residues F16, F5, F7 and F6 are likewise particularly preferred. Moring a oil includes a mixture of fatty acid triglycerides obtained by esterifying glycerol with the fatty acids selected from myristic acid (F4), palmitic acid (F5), stearic acid (F6), behenic acid (F8), oleic acid (F13) and linoleic acid (F16). Thus, mixtures of fatty acid triglyceride esters (b) of formula (II) are likewise most particularly preferred in which Ra, Rb and/or Rc are selected from the fatty acid residues F4, F5, F6, F8, F13 and F16. The colors obtained with the addition of moringa oil are likewise characterized by high-shine color results and exceptionally good wash fastness. Apricot kernel oil includes as its main components triglycerides bearing the fatty acids oleic acid (F13) and linoleic acid (F16). Mixtures of fatty acid triglycerides (b) of formula (II) in which Ra, Rb and/or Rc are selected from the fatty acid residues F13 and F16 have likewise had an advantageous effect on the wash fastness, shine and feel of hair colored with the agents according to the present specification. Marula oil substantially includes fatty acid triglycerides wherein the esterified fatty acids are primarily palmitic acid (F5), stearic acid (F6), oleic acid (F13) and linoleic acid (F16), and is likewise exceptionally suitable for producing intense, high-shine colors with excellent wash fastness. For that reason, mixtures of fatty acid triglyceride esters (b) of formula (II) are likewise preferred in which Ra, Rb and/or Rc are selected from the fatty acid residues F5, F6, F13 and F16. Finally, colors obtained through the use of combinations of cationic anthraquinone dyes of formula (I) with hydrogenated and/or non-hydrogenated castor oil are also characterized by outstanding wash fastness, high shine and good care. Castor oil consists predominantly of a triglyceride wherein the esterified fatty acids are primilary ricinoleic acid (F21), which is converted by hydrogenation to 12-hydroxy-octadecanoic acid (F22). Thus, mixtures of fatty acid triglyceride esters (b) of formula (II) are moreover most particularly preferred in which Ra, Rb and/or Rc are selected from the fatty acid residues F21 and/or F22.

The pH of the agents according to the present specification may therefore be between 3 and 11. It is preferable for the pH of the ready-to-use agent to be between 5 and 11, in particular between 5 and 7.

With regard to further optional components and to the amounts of these components used, reference is expressly made to the relevant manuals, for example Kh. Schrader, Grundlagen and Rezepturen der Kosmetika [Fundamentals and formulations of cosmetics], 2nd Edition, Hüthig Buch Verlag, Heidelberg, 1989. The additional active ingredients and auxiliary substances are used in the agents according to the present specification preferably in amounts of from 0.0001 to 25 wt. % in each case, in particular from 0.0005 to 15 wt. %, relative to the total weight of the application mixture. A method for coloring keratinic fibers, in particular human hair, which is characterized in that an agent of the first subject matter of the present specification is applied to the keratin-containing fibers, left on the fibers for from 5 to 60 minutes and then rinsed out again with water or washed out with a shampoo, is suitable in particular for the application of the agents according to the present specification. The contact time of the ready-to-use coloring agents is preferably from 5 to 45 minutes, in particular from 10 to 40 minutes, particularly preferably from 15 to 35 minutes. At the end of the contact time the remaining coloring preparation is rinsed out of the hair with water or a cleaning agent. The agents according to the present specification may be formulated as one-component agents (coloring and lightening agent) or as multi-component agents such as two-component agents or three-component agents, and used accordingly. A separation into multi-component systems is useful in particular where incompatibilities between the ingredients are to be expected or of concern; in such systems, the agent to be used is prepared by the consumer immediately before use by mixing the components together. If the agent according to the present specification includes both substantive dyes—as well as optionally additionally oxidation dye precursors—and oxidizing agents, they are conveniently packaged separately from one another in order to avoid a premature, undesired reaction and brought into contact only immediately before application. A coloring and lightening method in which the coloring cream and the oxidizing agent are initially separate is therefore preferred. The present specification therefore also provides a method for coloring and lightening human hair, wherein a composition on an aqueous basis including hydrogen peroxide is mixed with an agent according to the present specification including at least one compound of formula (I) to form a homogeneous composition, and this is applied to the hair. The fatty acid triglyceride (b) may in this case be packaged with the hydrogen peroxide solution, with the compound of formula (I), or with both. In a further example of the present specification, agents are therefore preferred which are characterized in that they are produced immediately before application by mixing at least two preparations, wherein the at least two preparations are provided in at least two separately packaged containers, and wherein one container contains an agent (A), which includes in a cosmetic carrier at least one cationic anthraquinone dye of formula (I), optionally including oxidation dye precursors as well, and a further container contains an oxidizing agent preparation (B) including at least one oxidizing agent. The fatty acid triglycerides (b) may in this case be packaged together with the cationic anthraquinone dye of formula (I) in container (A), together with the oxidizing agent preparation in container (B), or both. The formulation of a combination of (a) compounds of the general formula (I) with (b) fatty acid triglycerides is outstandingly suitable for producing intense colors with high brilliance, high shine and a low selectivity in conjunction with an outstanding wash fastness. The agents are likewise outstandingly suitable for minimizing or preventing the drying out of the scalp. The present specification also provides the use of an agent of the first subject matter of the present specification to produce hair dyes having increased shine, an intense color result with improved fastness properties and/or reduced selectivity. All that has been stated in respect of the agents according to the present specification applies with necessary alterations to further preferred examples of the methods and use according to the present specification.
