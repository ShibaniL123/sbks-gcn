A mixture of 4-hydroxybenzonitrile (15.39 g, 129 mmol), pentaerythrityl tetrabromide (11.63 g, 30 mmol), potassium carbonate (27.60 g, 200 mmol), and DMF (50 mL) was stirred under argon and heated at 110Â° C. Progress of the reaction was monitored by NMR. After 3 h, the reaction mixture was poured into ice/water (400 mL), acidified with 36% HCl to pH 1, and stirred for 15 min. The precipitate was filtered off, washed with water and dried in air. Column chromatography of the crude product (silica gel, hexane/toluene/ethyl acetate, 30:60:100) gave pure Compound T4, 4,4'-((2-(bromomethyl)-2-((4-cyanophenoxy)methyl)propane-1,3-diyl)bis(oxy))dibenzonitrile. (6.04 g, 40% yield).
