TITLE FOAM EXPANSION AGENT COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING HYDROHALOOLEFIN AND WATER AND THEIR USES IN THE PREPARATION OF POLYURETHANE AND POLYISOCYAN URATE POLYMER FOAMS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The disclosure herein relates to foam expansion agents and their use in the preparation of polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams. More particularly, the disclosure herein relates to foam expansion agent compositions comprising a hydrohaloolefin and water, the foam-forming compositions containing such foam expansion agent compositions, the preparation of polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams using such foam-forming compositions and the use of so prepared polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Closed-cell polyurethane and polyisocyanurate polymer foams are widely used for insulation purposes, for example, in building construction and in the manufacture of energy efficient electrical appliances. In the construction industry, polyurethane/polyisocyanurate board stock is used in roofing and siding for its insulation and load-carrying capabilities. Poured and sprayed polyurethane foams are widely used for a variety of applications including insulating roofs, insulating large structures such as storage tanks, insulating appliances such as refrigerators and freezers, insulating refrigerated trucks and railcars, etc. The insulation performance of a closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam is mainly determined by the thermal conductivity of the cell gas. In the industry, the insulation performance of a polymer foam is represented by the R-value. All of these various types of polyurethane/polyisocyanurate foams require foam expansion agents (also known as blowing agents) for their manufacture. Insulating foams depend on the use of halocarbon foam expansion agents, not only to foam the polymer, but primarily for their low vapor thermal conductivity, a very important characteristic for insulation value. For example, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have been employed as foam expansion agents for polyurethane foams. An example of an HFC employed in this application is HFC-245fa (1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane). However, the HFCs are of concern due to their contribution to the "greenhouse effect", i.e., they contribute to global warming. As a result of their contribution to global warming, the HFCs have come under scrutiny, and their widespread use may also be limited in the future. Hydrocarbons have also been proposed as foam expansion agents. However, these compounds are flammable, and many are photochemically reactive, and as a result contribute to the production of ground level ozone (i.e., smog). Such compounds are typically referred to as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and are subject to environmental regulations. Boiling point of a foam expansion agent can affect the insulation performance of the resulting polymer foam. A high boiling point foam expansion agent may condense in the cell and lose its insulation effectiveness at low temperature. Normally, a foam expansion agent with higher boiling point condenses more severely at low temperatures and causes poorer insulation performance (i.e., lower R-value) of the polymer foam at low temperature applications. Z-1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluoro-2-butene has vapor thermal conductivity of 10.7 mW/mK at 25 °C and a normal boiling point of 33 °C. 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane has vapor thermal conductivity of 12.7 mW/mK at 25 °C and a normal boiling point of 15°C. Carbon dioxide has vapor thermal conductivity of 16.5 mW/mK at 25 °C. Japanese Patent No. 05179043 discloses and attempts to use Ζ-1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluoro-2-butene as the foam expansion agent for polyurethane foams.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as defined in the appended claims. Other features and benefits of any one or more of the embodiments will be apparent from the following detailed description, and from the claims. In some circumstances, water may be present in a foam expansion agent composition in the preparation of polyurethane and polyisocyanurate polymer foams. During the process, water reacts with polyisocyanate to form carbon dioxide (CO2) which serves as an additional foam expansion agent. Since carbon dioxide has high vapor thermal conductivity, the presence of water in a foam expansion agent composition normally negatively affects the insulation performance of the resulting polymer foam. It was surprisingly found through experiments that the water presence in a foam expansion agent composition comprising Ζ-1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluoro-2-butene (Z-CF3CH=CHCF3, Z-FC-1336mzz, Z-FO-1336η∩ζζ) improves insulation performance (i.e., R-value) of the resulting polymer foam. As indicated above, this disclosure provides a foam expansion agent composition comprising (a) a hydrohaloolefin of the formula CF3CX=CHY, wherein X is selected from the group consisting of FI, Cl and F, and Υ is selected from the group consisting of FI, Cl, F, CF3 and CF2CF3; and (b) water. Some hydrohaloolefins of the formula CF3CX=CFIY, such as CF3CH=CHF, CF3CH=CHCF3i CF3CH=CHCF2CF3 and CF3CH=CHCI, may exist as different configurational isomers or stereoisomers. When the specific isomer is not designated, the present disclosure is intended to include all single configurational isomers, single stereoisomers, or any combination thereof. For instance, CF3CH=CHCF3 is meant to represent the E-isomer, Z-isomer, or any combination or mixture of both isomers in any ratio.

The foam expansion agent composition of this disclosure can be prepared in any manner convenient to one skilled in this art, including simply weighing desired quantities of each component and, thereafter, combining them in an appropriate container at appropriate temperatures and pressures. As used herein, the terms “comprises,” “comprising,” “includes,” “including,” “has,” “having” or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion. For example, a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus.

Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of embodiments of the present invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety, unless a particular passage is cited. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting. This disclosure also provides a foam-forming composition comprising (a) the foam expansion agent composition which comprises a hydrohaloolefin of the formula CFsCX=CHY and water as described in this disclosure, and (b) an active hydrogen-containing compound having two or more active hydrogens. In some embodiments of this invention, the foam-forming composition comprises (a) the foam expansion agent composition comprising Z-CF3CH=CHCF3 and water as described in this disclosure, and (b) an active hydrogen-containing compound having two or more active hydrogens. In some embodiments of this invention, these active hydrogens are in the form of hydroxyl groups. The active hydrogen-containing compounds of this disclosure can comprise compounds having two or more groups that contain an active hydrogen atom reactive with an isocyanate group, such as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,394,491; hereby incorporated by reference. Examples of such compounds have at least two hydroxyl groups per molecule, and more specifically comprise polyols, such as polyether or polyester polyols. Examples of such polyols are those which have an equivalent weight of about 50 to about 700, normally of about 70 to about 300, more typically of about 90 to about 270, and carry at least 2 hydroxyl groups, usually 3 to 8 such groups. Examples of suitable polyols comprise polyester polyols such as aromatic polyester polyols, e.g., those made by transesterifying polyethylene terephthalate (PET) scrap with a glycol such as diethylene glycol, or made by reacting phthalic anhydride with a glycol. The resulting polyester polyols may be reacted further with ethylene - and/or propylene oxide - to form an extended polyester polyol containing additional internal alkyleneoxy groups. Examples of suitable polyols also comprise polyether polyols such as polyethylene oxides, polypropylene oxides, mixed polyethylenepropylene oxides with terminal hydroxyl groups, among others. Other suitable polyols can be prepared by reacting ethylene and/or propylene oxide with an initiator having 2 to 16, generally 3 to 8 hydroxyl groups as present, for example, in glycerol, pentaerythritol and carbohydrates such as sorbitol, glucose, sucrose and the like polyhydroxy compounds. Suitable polyether polyols can also include alaphatic or aromatic aminebased polyols. The foam-forming composition of this disclosure can be prepared in any manner convenient to one skilled in this art, including simply weighing desired quantities of each component and, thereafter, combining them in an appropriate container at appropriate temperatures and pressures. This disclosure also provides processes for producing a closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam which comprises reacting an effective amount of the foam-forming compositions of this disclosure with a suitable polyisocyanate. In some embodiments of this invention, the hydrohaloolefin in the foam-forming compositions used in the processes for producing a closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam hereinabove is Z-CF3CH=CHCF3. By “effective amount of the foam-forming composition” is meant an amount of the foam-forming composition, which, when reacted with a suitable polyisocyanate, results in a closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam. By “a suitable polyisocyanate” is meant a polyisocyanate which can react with foam-forming compositions of this disclosure to form closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foams. Typically, before reacting with a suitable polyisocyanate, the active hydrogen-containing compound and optionally other additives are mixed with the foam expansion agent composition to form a foam-forming composition. Such foam-forming composition is typically known in the art as an isocyanate-reactive preblend, or B-side composition. When preparing polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foams, the polyisocyanate reactant is normally selected in such proportion relative to that of the active hydrogen-containing compound that the ratio of the equivalents of isocyanate groups to the equivalents of active hydrogen groups, i.e., the foam index, is from about 0.9 to about 10 and in most cases from about 1 to about 4. While any suitable polyisocyanate can be employed in the instant process, examples of suitable polyisocyanates useful for making polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foam comprise at least one of aromatic, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates, among others. Representative members of these compounds comprise diisocyanates such as meta- or paraphenylene diisocyanate, toluene-2,4-diisocyanate, toluene-2,6-diisocyanate, hexamethylene-1,6-diisocyanate, tetramethylene-1,4-diisocyanate, cyclohexane-1,4-diisocyanate, hexahydrotoluene diisocyanate (and isomers), napthylene-1,5-diisocyanate, 1 -methylphenyl-2,4-phenyldiisocyanate, diphenylmethane-4,4-diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-2,4-diissocyanate, 4,4 biphenylenediisocyanate and 3,3-dimethyoxy-4,4 biphenylenediisocyanate and 3,3-dimethyldiphenylpropane-4,4-diisocyanate; triisocyanates such as toluene-2,4,6-triisocyanate and polyisocyanates such as 4,4 dimethyldiphenylmethane-2,2,5,5-tetraisocyanate and the diverse polymethylenepoly-phenylopolyisocyanates, mixtures thereof, among others. A crude polyisocyanate may also be used in the practice of this invention, such as the crude toluene diisocyanate obtained by the phosgenating a mixture comprising toluene diamines, or the crude diphenylmethane diisocyanate obtained by the phosgenating crude diphenylmethanediamine. Specific examples of such compounds comprise methylene-bridged polyphenyl polyisocyanates, due to their ability to crosslink the polyurethane. It is often desirable to employ minor amounts of additives in preparing polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foams. Among these additives comprise one or more members selected from the group consisting of catalysts, surfactants, flame retardants, preservatives, colorants, antioxidants, reinforcing agents, filler, antistatic agents, among others well known in this art. Depending upon the composition, a surfactant can be employed to stabilize the foaming reaction mixture while curing. Such surfactants normally comprise a liquid or solid organosilicone compound. The surfactants are employed in amounts sufficient to stabilize the foaming reaction mixture against collapse and to prevent the formation of large, uneven cells. In one embodiment of this invention, about 0.1 % to about 5% by weight of surfactant based on the total weight of all foaming ingredients (i.e. foam expansion agent composition + active hydrogen-containing compounds + polyisocyanates + additives) are used. In another embodiment of this invention, about 1.5% to about 3% by weight of surfactant based on the total weight of all foaming ingredients are used. One or more catalysts for the reaction of the active hydrogen-containing compounds, e.g. polyols, with the polyisocyanate may be also employed. While any suitable urethane catalyst may be employed, specific catalyst comprise tertiary amine compounds and organometallic compounds. Exemplary such catalysts are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,164,419, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. For example, a catalyst for the trimerization of polyisocyanates, such as an alkali metal alkoxide, alkali metal carboxylate, or quaternary amine compound, may also optionally be employed herein. Such catalysts are used in an amount which measurably increases the rate of reaction of the polyisocyanate. Typical amounts of catalysts are about 0.1% to about 5% by weight based on the total weight of all foaming ingredients. In the process of the invention for making a polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam, the active hydrogen-containing compound (e.g. polyol), polyisocyanate, foam expansion agent composition and other components are contacted, thoroughly mixed, and permitted to expand and cure into a cellular polymer. The mixing apparatus is not critical, and various conventional types of mixing head and spray apparatus are used. By conventional apparatus is meant apparatus, equipment, and procedures conventionally employed in the preparation of polyurethane and polyisocyanurate polymer foams in which conventional foam expansion agents, such as fluorotrichloromethane (CCI3F, CFC-11), are employed. Such conventional apparatus are discussed by: FI. Boden et al. in chapter 4 of the Polyurethane Flandbook, edited by G. Oertel, Hanser Publishers, New York, 1985; a paper by FI. Grunbauer et al. titled "Fine Celled CFC-Free Rigid Foam - New Machinery with Low Boiling Blowing Agents" published in Polyurethanes 92 from the Proceedings of the SPI 34th Annual Technical/Marketing Conference, October 21-October 24, 1992, New Orleans, Louisiana; and a paper by Μ. Taverna et al. titled "Soluble or Insoluble Alternative Blowing Agents? Processing Technologies for Both Alternatives, Presented by the Equipment Manufacturer", published in Polyurethanes World Congress 1991 from the Proceedings of the SPI/ISOPA September 24-26,1991, Acropolis, Nice, France. These disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference. In some embodiments of this invention, a preblend of certain raw materials is prepared prior to reacting the polyisocyanate and active hydrogen-containing components. For example, it is often useful to blend the polyol(s), foam expansion agent composition, surfactant(s), catalysts(s) and other foaming ingredients, except for polyisocyanates, and then contact this blend with the polyisocyanate. Alternatively, all the foaming ingredients may be introduced individually to the mixing zone where the polyisocyanate and polyol(s) are contacted. It is also possible to pre-react all or a portion of the polyol(s) with the polyisocyanate to form a prepolymer. The compositions and processes of this invention are applicable to the production of all kinds of expanded polyurethane and polyisocyanurate polymer foams, including, for example, integral skin, RIM and flexible foams, and in particular rigid closed-cell polymer foams useful in spray insulation, as pour-in-place appliance foams, or as rigid insulating board stock and laminates. This disclosure also provides a closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyan urate polymer foam prepared from reaction of an effective amount of the foam-forming composition of this disclosure with a suitable polyisocyanate. In some embodiments of this invention, the hydrohaloolefin in the foam-forming compositions used for the preparation hereinabove of such closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam is Z-CF3CH=CHCF3. In some embodiments of this invention, such closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam prepared hereinabove has an initial R-value greater than 6.0 ft2-hr-°F/BTU-in at about 23.9 °C. The closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foams used in the refrigerators, freezers, refrigerated trailers, walk-in coldstorage, et al. are subject to low temperatures. In these applications, a foam expansion agent may condense in the cell and lose its insulation effectiveness. Normally, it is advantageous to use a low boiling point foam expansion agent to make foams for low temperature applications. It was surprisingly found through experiments that the water presence in a foam expansion agent composition comprising Z-CF3CFI=CFICF3 may elevate the R-value of the resulting closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam above the R-value of the foam made by 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane under the same conditions. By “normal boiling point” is meant the boiling temperature of a liquid at which vapor pressure is equal to one atmosphere. This disclosure also provides a process which comprises using the closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam of this disclosure at a temperature of no more than about the normal boiling point of the hydrohaloolefin in the foam-forming compositions used for the preparation of such closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam. In some embodiments of this invention, the hydrohaloolefin used hereinabove is Z-CF3CFI=CFICF3, and the amount of water in the foam expansion agent composition used for the preparation of the closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam hereinabove is at least 47 mole %. In some embodiments of this invention, the closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam made from the foam expansion agent composition comprising Z-CF3CH=CHCF3and at least 47 mole % of water in such foam expansion agent composition is used at temperatures of no more than about 23.9 °C (75 Farenheit). In some embodiments of this invention, such closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam is used at temperatures of no more than about 10 °C (50 Farenheit). In some embodiments of this invention, such closed-cell polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam is used at temperatures of no more than about 0 °C (32 Farenheit). Many aspects and embodiments have been described above and are merely exemplary and not limiting. After reading this specification, skilled artisans appreciate that other aspects and embodiments are possible without departing from the scope of the invention.
