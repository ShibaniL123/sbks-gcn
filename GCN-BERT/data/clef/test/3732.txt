BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 depicts the mean concentration of nilotinib in Patients treated with 400 mg nilotinib twice daily. FIG. 2 depicts the hypothesis that QHS dosing is associated with increased bioavailability of nilotinib. The compound of formula I, wherein Py denotes 3-pyridyl, R1 represents hydrogen, R2 represents 5-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl and R4 represents methyl, is known under the International Non-proprietary Name “nilotinib”. Nilotinib (4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]-N-[5-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]benzamide) is approved and marketed in the form of its monohydrochloride monohydrate salt under the brand name Tasigna™. Nilotinib is an ATP-competitive inhibitor for Bcr-Abl and also inhibits c-Kit, DDR1, DDR2 and PDGF-R kinase activity at clinically relevant concentrations. Tasigna™ is available as 200 mg hard capsule for oral administration for the treatment of Philadelphia-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in the chronic phase (CP) and accelerated phase (AP) in patients resistant to or intolerant of at least one prior therapy including imatinib. For the treatment of CML a daily dose of 800 mg of nilotinib is applied in two doses of 400 mg each. The effect of food on the pharmacokinetic parameters of 400 mg oral dose of nilotinib in the formulation mentioned above was studied in human subjects. The concomitant administration of nilotinib with food significantly increased subjects exposure, especially in high fat meals. In said study the total exposure (AUC0-1) was 82% and Cmax was 112% after a high fat breakfast, whereas the increase in total exposure (AUC0-1) was 29% and Cmax was 55% after a light breakfast given 30 minutes prior to dosing. In view of these findings, it is recommended that nilotinib shall not be taken with a meal in order to minimize the effect of food on nilotinib bioavailability. A statement in this regard Is, for instance, included in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC (Summary of Product Characteristics) of the marketing authorization for Tasigna™ issued by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). The present invention is based on the conclusion that once daily bedtime dosing (QHS) of nilotinib is associated with a systemic exposure comparable to that of the current used dosing of 300 mg BID, so that the total daily dose of drug products comprising nilotinib can be reduced compared to the dose required under the same medical circumstances when using a conventional treatment regimen. In a study in healthy volunteers as described in the Examples, a slight diurnal effect on nilotinib pharmacokinetics (PK) was confirmed. Nilotinib exposure was shown to be up to 20% higher following the evening dose than the morning dose. Further, it was found that when a pyrimidylaminobenzamide of formula I is administered to a human once daily QHS the risk of food drug interaction is minimized. The instant treatment regimen provides patients with a convenient once daily dosing, thus improving patient compliance. The instant treatment regimen offers the benefit of maintaining efficacy of the pyrimidylaminobenzamide of formula I while reducing the food effect observed when using a conventional treatment regimen. Hence, the present invention relates to the use of pyrimidylaminobenzamides of formula I wherein the radicals have the meanings as provided above, or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof alone or in combination with other active compounds for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of proliferative disorders and other pathological conditions mediated by Bcr-Abl, c-Kit, DDR1, DDR2 or PDGF-R kinase activity, wherein the medicament is adjusted in manner to be used once daily at bedtime (QHS).

EXAMPLES Example 1 Study in CML Patients Obtaining 400 mg Nilotinib Twice Daily 21 Patients were treated with 400 mg nilotinib twice daily. The mean concentration over time is shown in FIG. 1. Blood samples were collected prior to morning dose (C0) and prior to evening dose (C12). It was found that the ratio C0/C12 is 1.7. With other words, the trough concentration of nilotinib in the morning was 60 to 80% higher than that observed in the evening. Example 2 Simulation of 600 mg QHS Vs. 400 mg Twice Daily The simulation depicted in FIG. 2 is based on the hypothesis that QHS dosing is associated with increased bioavailability of nilotinib. Based on that assumption, Cmax appears to be similar for both treatment approaches. Example 3 PK Study in Healthy Volunteers The increased exposure with QHS was confirmed in a study investigating nilotinib pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers (HV) comparing cohorts receiving 600 mg morning dose or 600 mg morning dose QHS, respectively. In a single center, 4-way crossover study (n=16-24), HV group A was administered 300 mg nilotinib (in the form of nilotinib monohydrochloride monohydrate) in the morning, 2 hours after breakfast; HV group B was administered 300 mg nilotinib (in the form of nilotinib monohydrochloride monohydrate) in the evening, 2 hours after diner; HV group C was administered 600 mg nilotinib (in the form of nilotinib monohydrochloride monohydrate) in the evening, 2 hours after diner; and HV group D was administered 600 mg nilotinib (in the form of nilotinib monohydrochloride monohydrate) in the evening, 4 hours after diner.
