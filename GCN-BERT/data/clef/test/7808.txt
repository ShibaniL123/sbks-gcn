In particular, this disclosure relates to single or multiple balloon-type gastric space fillers and devices and methods for explant of the same. SUMMARY According to embodiments, disclosed is a deflation catheter device, comprising: a catheter tube having a lumen, a proximal end, and a distal end; a stylet disposed within the lumen of the catheter tube and configured to extend beyond the distal end of the catheter tube to puncture a wall of an implanted balloon device; a handle disposed at a proximal end of the catheter tube and attached to the stylet, wherein the handle is configured to controllably advance, retract, and rotate the stylet relative to the catheter tube; and a suction port disposed at a proximal end of the catheter tube and being in fluid communication with the lumen of the catheter tube. The deflation catheter device may further comprise a seal between the catheter tube and the handle, wherein the stylet crosses the seal from the handle to the lumen of the catheter tube without introducing leaks or pressure losses. The deflation catheter device may further comprise an interface between the handle and a base of the catheter tube configured to guide advancement, retraction, and rotation of the stylet relative to the catheter tube. The interface may be complementary threading. The deflation catheter device may further comprise an aspiration hole providing fluid communication between the interior of a balloon and the catheter tube. The catheter tube and the stylet may define a gap there between at the distal end of the catheter tube, wherein the gap provides fluid communication between the lumen of the catheter tube and an interior of the implanted balloon device while extended within the implanted balloon device. The catheter tube may contain at least one side hole, wherein the at least one side hole provides fluid communication between the lumen of the catheter tube and an interior of the implanted balloon device while extended within the implanted balloon device. According to embodiments, disclosed is a deflation catheter device, comprising: a catheter tube having a lumen, a proximal end, and a distal end; a hollow needle device disposed within the lumen of the catheter tube and configured to extend beyond the distal end of the catheter tube to puncture a wall of an implanted balloon device; a handle disposed at a proximal end of the catheter tube and attached to the stylet, wherein the handle is configured to controllably advance, retract, and rotate the needle device relative to the catheter tube; and a suction port disposed at a proximal end of the catheter tube and being in fluid communication with the lumen of the catheter tube.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Various catheter devices having a piercing needle may be used during deflation of intragastric balloon systems to puncture a balloon and aspirate its contents. A catheter device that utilizes a coring mechanism to breach the balloon wall may also be used to aspirate fluid from the balloon. For some of these catheter devices, the needle is connected to a stylet that resides within the catheter tube and has a handle that extends out of a port in the catheter designated for connecting to suction equipment. To puncture the balloon, the handle is pushed forward to advance the needle-tipped stylet into the balloon. It is noted that without any optional control mechanism, the user may accidentally push the handle and expose the needle prematurely. After puncturing the balloon and inserting the catheter through the puncture, the stylet must be removed from the catheter through the port such that suction equipment may be connected to the catheter. In the case that the balloon system has multiple balloons, the stylet is reloaded into the catheter tube or a new catheter device is used in order to puncture additional balloons. According to embodiments, a novel catheter system is disclosed herein for addressing implantable, inflatable medical devices efficiently, safely, and controllably. The present inventors have developed new catheter devices that allow for puncture and aspiration of fluid from multiple balloons without requiring removal of tools or reconnecting suction tubing and that further provides a controlled advancement and retraction of the needle tip. According to embodiments, disclosed is deflation catheter device 1 having a proximal end near a user and a distal end near a location of operation. According to embodiments, and as shown in FIGS. 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D, deflation catheter device 1 comprises a y-connector at or near the proximal end. The y-connector connects a distal segment of catheter tube 10 with two segments: handle 30 and suction port 50. Suction port 50 may connect suction equipment (e.g., a pump or syringe) to catheter tube 10, such that suction port 50 is in fluid communication with the lumen of catheter tube 10. In this manner, access via fluid communication with the distal end of catheter tube 10 is provided at the proximal end thereof. According to embodiments, seal 100 may be provided near suction port 50 to prevent leakage or vacuum loss between the distal portion of catheter tube 10 and another segment connected to the y-connector (e.g., portion containing handle 30). As shown in FIG. 1D, stylet 20 may cross seal 100 from the handle side to the distal segment of catheter tube 10 without allowing leakage or vacuum loss between the distal portion of catheter tube 10 and the handle portion. For example, seal 100 may be configured to allow stylet 20 to pass from the proximal end of catheter tube 10 into the fluid path without allowing leaks around stylet 20. Thus, suction port 50 is provided with exclusive fluid communication access to the lumen of catheter tube 10. This configuration allows for aspiration of fluid through catheter tube 10 without having to remove stylet 20 from the distal segment of catheter tube 10. Also, this enables the user to efficiently puncture and aspirate multiple balloons consecutively because, after deflating one balloon, stylet 20 may simply be retracted to be within catheter tube 10 and advanced again to puncture another balloon without having to entirely reload stylet 20 and risk damaging the catheter. According to embodiments, interface 40 may be provided for control of stylet 20 relative to catheter tube 10. Interface 40 may allow controlled advancement, retraction, and/or rotation of stylet 20 as well as selective securing of its position relative to catheter tube 10 when not in use. For example, as shown in FIG. 1, a threaded interface between base 60 of catheter tube 10 and stylet 20 may permit the advancement or retraction of stylet 20 when handle 30 is rotated. According to embodiments, interface 40 may be located proximally or distally along the length of catheter tube 10 (i.e., base 60 thereof). This feature provides for the controlled movement of stylet 20. The ratio of axial travel to the number of rotations may be controlled by the pitch of the threaded interface (for example, approximately 6 threads per inch), which may be optimized for efficient advancement of stylet 20 and consistent puncture of balloons by the rotating stylet 20. The threaded interface may be designed with stops in the threads that limit how far stylet 20 can advance relative to catheter tube 10. For example, stylet 20 may be prohibited from extending beyond approximately 2 cm past the distal tip of the catheter for safety. The threaded interface may be designed with stops in the threads that limit how far stylet 20 can retract relative to catheter tube 10. For example, the amount of retraction may be limited to just within catheter tube 10 for efficient deployment of stylet 20. Another feature of a threaded interface is that the risk of accidentally exposing the tip is eliminated because the user must intentionally actuate stylet 20 by rotating handle 30 in order to advance stylet 20. According to embodiments, handle 30 may be actuated by a motorized device that rotates stylet 20 designed with threads or linearly advances stylet 20 without threads. Other types of interfaces are contemplated, including spring-loaded, pressure activated, hydraulically-powered, interfacing gears, etc. According to embodiments, after puncturing a balloon system, fluid may be aspirated from the balloon system through or into catheter tube 10 via an aspiration hole when at least a portion of stylet 20 is advanced beyond the distal opening of catheter tube 10. According to embodiments, as shown in FIG. 2, gaps 14 may be provided at or near the distal end of catheter tube 10 for aspiration between catheter tube 10 and stylet 20, as shown in FIG. 2. For example, the distal opening that accommodates stylet 20 may also be used for aspiration, as shown in the left side of FIG. 2. Gaps 14 may be effective as the portion containing the same is advanced beyond the wall of the balloon and into the interior thereof. According to embodiments, as shown in FIG. 3, catheter tube 10 is designed with side holes 16 along the length thereof, such that fluid may be suctioned into catheter tube 10 even when stylet 20 is fully or partially occluding the distal tip opening. Side holes 16 may be effective as the portion containing the same is advances beyond the wall of the balloon and into the interior thereof. According to embodiments, devices and components may be configured for use within a scope device, such as a gastroscope or endoscope. Various dimensions of such a system may be used and customized based on the needs of the application and the use. For example, for use through a 2.8 mm diameter gastroscope channel, catheter tube 10 may have an outer diameter of about 0.100″ to about 0.107″, an inner diameter of about 0.070″ to about 0.086″, and a length of about 50″ to about 75″. Markings may be printed on the distal section of the catheter to indicate the 1 cm and 2 cm mark of the catheter. By further example, stylet 20 may have a wire diameter of about 0.030″ to about 0.040″ and a coring tip diameter of about 0.040″ to about 0.052″. According to embodiments, stylet 20 may be constructed of a custom wire rope (e.g. the Helical Hollow Strand®, Fort Wayne Metals, Inc., Fort Wayne, Ind.), which has superior column strength and translates rotation better than standard wire rope. Such a stylet wire design ensures a consistent coring motion at the tip for successful puncture of the balloon system without tearing the balloon skin. According to embodiments, stylet 20 may have one or more of a variety of designs and configurations. Stylet 20 may have a needle tip configuration taking the shape of a coring needle, a sharpened conical point, or a sharpened beveled point. Other geometries and shapes are contemplated as effective for achieving the results disclosed herein, as recognized by those having ordinary skill in the art. According to embodiments, as shown in FIG. 4, hollow needle device 80 and obturator 70 are disclosed. Hollow needle device 80 includes channel 84, with obturator 70 disposed therein. Needle device 80 may be sheathed within an introducer tube for efficient delivery through an endoscope. For example, needle device 80 may be within the lumen of catheter tube 10. According to embodiments, obturator 70 may be configured to provide a smooth transition at needle tip 82, such that it may be delivered to the balloon system without harming the patient or damaging the endoscope while obturator 70 is in an extended state (shown in FIGS. 4A and 5). In the extended state, at least a portion of obturator 70 is extended beyond the distal end of needle tip 82, such that a sharpened portion of needle tip 82 is not exposed, but rather made into part of a smooth transition. According to embodiments, catheter tube 10 may provide the features of needle device 80, as disclosed herein. According to embodiments, catheter tube 10 may include needle tip 82 at a distal end thereof, wherein catheter tube 10 is configured to puncture a balloon wall. According to embodiments, catheter tube 10 may house stylet 20 or obturator 70 in a lumen thereof, with features as disclosed herein. According to embodiments, catheter tube 10 may be a delivery system, such as an endoscope, gastroscope, etc., wherein devices housed therein may be advanced to provide features and functionality at an operation location. According to embodiments, obturator 70 may be retracted to a retracted state, as shown in FIG. 4B. In the retracted state, needle tip 82 is more exposed and capable of puncturing a target, as the smooth transition to obturator 70 has been removed. Retraction of obturator 70 activates the cutting, coring, puncturing, or other functionality of the needle tip. Obturator 70 may be retracted by a variety of methods. For example, the balloon wall may push obturator 70 back against a spring 90 as shown in FIG. 5. Obturator 70 may be retracted manually via a portion accessible at a proximal end by a user. Obturator 70 may be retracted by relatively low pressure applied to channel 84 relative to pressure exterior to channel 84. According to embodiments, a method to puncture and deflate a balloon system using devices, systems, and components described herein is disclosed. According to embodiments, suction tubing from a pump is connected to suction port 50 of the device's y-connector. At the user's discretion, suction may be started prior to or after inserting the catheter into the balloon system. According to embodiments, the device is delivered through the instrument channel of an endoscope to the implanted balloon system. With the distal end of stylet 20 retracted relative to the distal end of catheter tube 10, the catheter is positioned perpendicular against the surface of the balloon system. The user then rotates handle 30 or otherwise actuates stylet 20 to rotate and/or advance stylet 20. The tip of stylet 20 contacts and punctures the balloon skin. According to embodiments, the user advances the catheter to insert the device at least partially through the puncture. At this point, fluid may be aspirated from the inside of the balloon through gaps 14, side holes 16, or other fluid connections from within the balloon device. After the first balloon has been sufficiently deflated, handle 30 is rotated in the opposite direction or otherwise actuated to retract stylet 20 relative to catheter tube 10. Catheter tube 10 is then removed from the balloon. According to embodiments, where needle device 80 is delivered via catheter tube 10, needle device 80 may be activated and operated as disclosed herein to puncture a balloon in combination with aspiration operations to evacuate fluid from within the balloon. According to embodiments, the device may be repositioned against another balloon and the procedure may be repeated to puncture and suction fluid from additional balloons. The operations may be performed in the above or any variety of sequences that provides the desired results. According to embodiments, a kit of parts is disclosed, including components disclosed herein, for use by a user. Included in the kit may be instructions for use.
