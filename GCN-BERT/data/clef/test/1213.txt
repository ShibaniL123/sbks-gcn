Step 2
5-(4-Chlorobutyl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazole
8-Chlorooctane-2,4-dione (500 mg, 2.83 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (10 mL), 85% hydrazine hydrate (160 mg, 4.25 mmol) was added and the reaction was heated under reflux for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (1:1 petroleum ether / ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.5) to give 5-(4-chlorobutyl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazole (100 mg, as a colorless oil) with a yield of 20%.
