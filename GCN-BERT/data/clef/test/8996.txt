FIELD OF THE INVENTION The field of invention relates to plant breeding and genetics and, in particular, relates to recombinant DNA constructs useful in plants for conferring tolerance to drought. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Abiotic stress is the primary cause of crop loss worldwide, causing average yield losses of more than 50% for major crops (Boyer, J. S. (1982) Science 218:443-448; Bray, E. A. et al. (2000) In Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plants, Edited by Buchannan, B. B. et al., Amer. Soc. Plant Biol., pp. 1158-1249). Among the various abiotic stresses, drought is the major factor that limits crop productivity worldwide. Exposure of plants to a water-limiting environment during various developmental stages appears to activate various physiological and developmental changes. Understanding of the basic biochemical and molecular mechanism for drought stress perception, transduction and tolerance is a major challenge in biology. Reviews on the molecular mechanisms of abiotic stress responses and the genetic regulatory networks of drought stress tolerance have been published (Valliyodan. B., and Nguyen, H. T., (2006) Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 9:189-195; Wang, W., at al. (2003) Planta 218:1-14); Vinocur, B., and Altman, A. (2005) Curr. Opin. Biotechnol, 16:123-132; Chaves, M. M., and Oliveira, M. M. (2004) J. Exp. Bat. 55:2365-2384; Shinozaki, K., et al. (2003) Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 6:410-417; Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, K., and Shinozaki, K. (2005) Trends Plant Sci. 10:88-94). Earlier work on molecular aspects of abiotic stress responses was accomplished by differential and/or subtractive analysis (Bray, E. A. (1993) Plant Physiol. 103:1035-1040; Shinozaki, K., and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, K. (1997) Plant Physiol. 115:327-334; Zhu, J.-K. et al. (1997) Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 16:253-277; Thomashow, M. F. (1999) Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 50:571-599). Other methods include selection of candidate genes and analyzing expression of such a gene or its active product under stresses, or by functional complementation in a stressor system that is well defined (Xiang, L., and Zhu, J.-K. (2001) Physiologia Plantarum 112:152-166). Additionally, forward and reverse genetic studies involving the identification and isolation of mutations in regulatory genes have also been used to provide evidence for observed changes in gene expression under stress or exposure (Xiang, L., and Zhu, J.-K. (2001) Physiologia Plantarum 112:152-166). Activation tagging can be utilized to identify genes with the ability to affect a trait. This approach has been used in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana(Weigel, D., et al. (2000) Plant Physiol. 122:1003.-1013). Insertions of transcriptional enhancer elements can dominantly activate and/or elevate the expression of nearby endogenous genes. This method can be used to select genes involved in agronomically important phenotypes, including stress tolerance.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The disclosure of each reference set forth herein is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a plant” includes a plurality of such plants, reference to “a cell” includes one or more cells and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth. As Used Herein: The terms “AT-Self-incompatibilty protein related polypeptide”, “AT-SIPR polypeptide”, “AT-Drought Tolerant Phenotype 10 polypeptide” and “AT-DTP10 polypeptide” are used interchangeably herein and refer to an Arabidopsis thaliana protein encoded by the Arabidopsis thaliana locus At1g26797. The terms “Self-incompatibilty protein related polypeptide”, “SIPR polypeptide”, “Drought Tolerant Phenotype 10 polypeptide” and “DTP10 polypeptide” are used interchangeably herein and refer to homologs of At-DTP10. “Self-incompatibility protein-related polypeptides” refers to a family of proteins that are related to the self-incompatibility protein S1 of Papaver Rhoeas. (Foote H C, Ride J P, Franklin-Tong V E, Walker E A, Lawrence M J, Franklin F C; Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1994; 91:2265-2269. Cloning and expression of a distinctive class of self-incompatibility (S) gene from Papaver rhoeas L.). Self-Incompatibility (SI) is the incapability of apparently healthy plants to produce seed when self-pollinated. This inhibition of self-fertilization in some flowering plants occurs by a recognition mechanism wherein the plants are able to distinguish between self and non-self pollen. SI systems in most flowering plants are controlled by a single multi-allele locus termed the S-locus. In Papaver Rhoeas the SI response takes place at the stigma surface and is mediated by a complex signaling cascade involving a transient increase in Ca2+ and protein phopshorylation. This response is initiated following interaction between S-proteins secreted by the stigma and their cognate receptors in the pollen tube. The S-proteins are small, signaling molecules that can presumably bind to a receptor on the pollen, leading to intracellular signaling that ultimately leads to inhibition of pollen tube growth. The function of the SIPR proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana is not known, since it is a self-fertilizing plant (Mallen at al Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 1994, vol. 91, pp 1992-1997; Foote et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 1994, vol. 91, pp. 2265-2269; Wheeler et al., J. Exp. Botany, 2003, vol. 54 (380), pp. 131-139). The terms “monocot” and “monocotyledonous plant” are used interchangeably herein. A monocot of the current invention includes the Gramineae. The terms “dicot” and “dicotyledonous plant” are used interchangeably herein. A dicot of the current invention includes the following families: Brassicaceae, Leguminosae, and Solanaceae. The terms “full complement” and “full-length complement” are used interchangeably herein, and refer to a complement of a given nucleotide sequence, wherein the complement and the nucleotide sequence consist of the same number of nucleotides and are 100% complementary. An “Expressed Sequence Tag” (“EST”) is a DNA sequence derived from a cDNA library and therefore is a sequence which has been transcribed. An EST is typically obtained by a single sequencing pass of a cDNA insert. The sequence of an entire cDNA insert is termed the “Full-Insert Sequence” (“FIS”). A “Contig” sequence is a sequence assembled from two or more sequences that can be selected from, but not limited to, the group consisting of an EST, FIS and PCR sequence. A sequence encoding an entire or functional protein is termed a “Complete Gene Sequence” (“CGS”) and can be derived from an FIS or a contig. “Agronomic characteristic” is a measurable parameter including but not limited to, greenness, yield, growth rate, biomass, fresh weight at maturation, dry weight at maturation, fruit yield, seed yield, total plant nitrogen content, fruit nitrogen content, seed nitrogen content, nitrogen content in a vegetative tissue, total plant free amino acid content, fruit free amino acid content, seed free amino acid content, free amino acid content in a vegetative tissue, total plant protein content, fruit protein content, seed protein content, protein content in a vegetative tissue, drought tolerance, nitrogen uptake, root lodging, harvest index, stalk lodging, plant height, ear height, ear length, early seedling vigor and seedling emergence under low temperature stress. “Transgenic” refers to any cell, cell line, callus, tissue, plant part or plant, the genome of which has been altered by the presence of a heterologous nucleic acid, such as a recombinant DNA construct, including those initial transgenic events as well as those created by sexual crosses or asexual propagation from the initial transgenic event. The term “transgenic” as used herein does not encompass the alteration of the genome (chromosomal or extra-chromosomal) by conventional plant breeding methods or by naturally occurring events such as random cross-fertilization, non-recombinant viral infection, non-recombinant bacterial transformation, non-recombinant transposition, or spontaneous mutation. “Genome” as it applies to plant cells encompasses not only chromosomal DNA found within the nucleus, but organelle DNA found within subcellular components (e.g., mitochondrial, plastid) of the cell. “Plant” includes reference to whole plants, plant organs, plant tissues, seeds and plant cells and progeny of same. Plant cells include, without limitation, cells from seeds, suspension cultures, embryos, meristematic regions, callus tissue, leaves, roots, shoots, gametophytes, sporophytes, pollen, and microspores. “Progeny” comprises any subsequent generation of a plant. “Transgenic plant” includes reference to a plant which comprises within its genome a heterologous polynucleotide. For example, the heterologous polynucleotide is stably integrated within the genome such that the polynucleotide is passed on to successive generations. The heterologous polynucleotide may be integrated into the genome alone or as part of a recombinant DNA construct. “Heterologous” with respect to sequence means a sequence that originates from a foreign species, or, if from the same species, is substantially modified from its native form in composition and/or genomic locus by deliberate human intervention. “Polynucleotide”, “nucleic acid sequence”, “nucleotide sequence”, or “nucleic acid fragment” are used interchangeably and is a polymer of RNA or DNA that is single- or double-stranded, optionally containing synthetic, non-natural or altered nucleotide bases. Nucleotides (usually found in their 5′-monophosphate form) are referred to by their single letter designation as follows: “A” for adenylate or deoxyadenylate (for RNA or DNA, respectively), “C” for cytidylate or deoxycytidylate, “G” for guanylate or deoxyguanylate, “U” for uridylate, “T” for deoxythymidylate, “R” for purines (A or G), “Y” for pyrimidines (C or T), “K” for G or T, “H” for A or C or T, “I” for inosine, and “N” for any nucleotide. “Polypeptide”, “peptide”, “amino acid sequence” and “protein” are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical analogue of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers. The terms “polypeptide”, “peptide”, “amino acid sequence”, and “protein” are also inclusive of modifications including, but not limited to, glycosylation, lipid attachment, sulfation, gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, hydroxylation and ADP-ribosylation. “Messenger RNA (mRNA)” refers to the RNA that is without introns and that can be translated into protein by the cell. “cDNA” refers to a DNA that is complementary to and synthesized from a mRNA template using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The cDNA can be single-stranded or converted into the double-stranded form using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. “Mature” protein refers to a post-translationally processed polypeptide; i.e., one from which any pre- or pro-peptides present in the primary translation product have been removed. “Precursor” protein refers to the primary product of translation of mRNA; i.e., with pre- and pro-peptides still present. Pre- and pro-peptides may be and are not limited to intracellular localization signals. “Isolated” refers to materials, such as nucleic acid molecules and/or proteins, which are substantially free or otherwise removed from components that normally accompany or interact with the materials in a naturally occurring environment. Isolated polynucleotides may be purified from a host cell in which they naturally occur. Conventional nucleic acid purification methods known to skilled artisans may be used to obtain isolated polynucleotides. The term also embraces recombinant polynucleotides and chemically synthesized polynucleotides. “Recombinant” refers to an artificial combination of two otherwise separated segments of sequence, e.g., by chemical synthesis or by the manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic acids by genetic engineering techniques. “Recombinant” also includes reference to a cell or vector, that has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or a cell derived from a cell so modified, but does not encompass the alteration of the cell or vector by naturally occurring events (e.g., spontaneous mutation, natural transformation/transduction/transposition) such as those occurring without deliberate human intervention. “Recombinant DNA construct” refers to a combination of nucleic acid fragments that are not normally found together in nature. Accordingly, a recombinant DNA construct may comprise regulatory sequences and coding sequences that are derived from different sources, or regulatory sequences and coding sequences derived from the same source, but arranged in a manner different than that normally found in nature. The terms “entry done” and “entry vector” are used interchangeably herein. “Regulatory sequences” refer to nucleotide sequences located upstream (5′ non-coding sequences), within, or downstream (3′ non-coding sequences) of a coding sequence, and which influence the transcription. RNA processing or stability, or translation of the associated coding sequence. Regulatory sequences may include, but are not limited to, promoters, translation leader sequences, introns, and polyadenylation recognition sequences. The terms “regulatory sequence” and “regulatory element” are used interchangeably herein. “Promoter” refers to a nucleic acid fragment capable of controlling transcription of another nucleic acid fragment. “Promoter functional in a plant” is a promoter capable of controlling transcription in plant cells whether or not its origin is from a plant cell. “Tissue-specific promoter” and “tissue-preferred promoter” are used interchangeably, and refer to a promoter that is expressed predominantly but not necessarily exclusively in one tissue or organ, but that may also be expressed in one specific cell. “Developmentally regulated promoter” refers to a promoter whose activity is determined by developmental events. “Operably linked” refers to the association of nucleic acid fragments in a single fragment so that the function of one is regulated by the other. For example, a promoter is operably linked with a nucleic acid fragment when it is capable of regulating the transcription of that nucleic acid fragment. “Expression” refers to the production of a functional product. For example, expression of a nucleic acid fragment may refer to transcription of the nucleic acid fragment (e.g., transcription resulting in mRNA or functional RNA) and/or translation of mRNA into a precursor or mature protein. “Phenotype” means the detectable characteristics of a cell or organism. “Introduced” in the context of inserting a nucleic acid fragment (e.g., a recombinant DNA construct) into a cell, means “transfection” or “transformation” or “transduction” and includes reference to the incorporation of a nucleic acid fragment into a eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell where the nucleic acid fragment may be incorporated into the genome of the cell (e.g., chromosome, plasmid, plastid or mitochondrial DNA), converted into an autonomous replicon, or transiently expressed (e.g., transfected mRNA). A “transformed cell” is any cell into which a nucleic acid fragment (e.g., a recombinant DNA construct) has been introduced. “Transformation” as used herein refers to both stable transformation and transient transformation. “Stable transformation” refers to the introduction of a nucleic acid fragment into a genome of a host organism resulting in genetically stable inheritance. Once stably transformed, the nucleic acid fragment is stably integrated in the genome of the host organism and any subsequent generation. “Transient transformation” refers to the introduction of a nucleic acid fragment into the nucleus, or DNA-containing organelle, of a host organism resulting in gene expression without genetically stable inheritance. “Allele” is one of several alternative forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome. When the alleles present at a given locus on a pair of homologous chromosomes in a diploid plant are the same that plant is homozygous at that locus. If the alleles present at a given locus on a pair of homologous chromosomes in a diploid plant differ that plant is heterozygous at that locus. If a transgene is present on one of a pair of homologous chromosomes in a diploid plant that plant is hemizygous at that locus. A “chloroplast transit peptide” is an amino acid sequence which is translated in conjunction with a protein and directs the protein to the chloroplast or other plastid types present in the cell in which the protein is made. “Chloroplast transit sequence” refers to a nucleotide sequence that encodes a chloroplast transit peptide. A “signal peptide” is an amino acid sequence which is translated in conjunction with a protein and directs the protein to the secretory system (Chrispeels (1991) Ann. Rev. Plant Phys. Plant Mol. Biol. 42:21-53). If the protein is to be directed to a vacuole, a vacuolar targeting signal (supra) can further be added, or if to the endoplasmic reticulum, an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (supra) may be added. If the protein is to be directed to the nucleus, any signal peptide present should be removed and instead a nuclear localization signal included (Raikhel (1992) Plant Phys. 100:1627-1632). A “mitochondrial signal peptide” is an amino acid sequence which directs a precursor protein into the mitochondria (Zhang and Glaser (2002) Trends Plant Sci 7:14-21). Sequence alignments and percent identity calculations may be determined using a variety of comparison methods designed to detect homologous sequences including, but not limited to, the Megalign® program of the LASERGENE® bioinformatics computing suite (DNASTAR® Inc., Madison, Wis.). Unless stated otherwise, multiple alignment of the sequences provided herein were performed using the Clustal V method of alignment (Higgins and Sharp (1989) CABIOS. 5:151-153) with the default parameters (GAP PENALTY=10, GAP LENGTH PENALTY=10). Default parameters for pairwise alignments and calculation of percent identity of protein sequences using the Clustal V method are KTUPLE=1, GAP PENALTY=3, WINDOW=5 and DIAGONALS SAVED=5. For nucleic acids these parameters are KTUPLE=2, GAP PENALTY=5, WINDOW=4 and DIAGONALS SAVED=4. After alignment of the sequences, using the Clustal V program, it is possible to obtain “percent identity” and “divergence” values by viewing the “sequence distances” table on the same program; unless stated otherwise, percent identities and divergences provided and claimed herein were calculated in this manner. Standard recombinant DNA and molecular cloning techniques used herein are well known in the art and are described more fully in Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T.

Recombinant DNA Constructs and Suppression DNA Constructs: In one aspect, the present invention includes recombinant DNA constructs (including suppression DNA constructs). In one embodiment, a recombinant DNA construct comprises a polynucleotide operably linked to at least one regulatory sequence (e.g., a promoter functional in a plant), wherein the polynucleotide comprises (i) a nucleic acid sequence encoding an amino acid sequence of at least 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity, based on the Clustal V method of alignment, when compared to SEQ ID NOS: 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32 or 34; or (ii) a full complement of the nucleic acid sequence of (i). In another embodiment, a recombinant DNA construct comprises a polynucleotide operably linked to at least one regulatory sequence (e.g., a promoter functional in a plant), wherein said polynucleotide comprises (i) a nucleic acid sequence of at least 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity, based on the Clustal V method of alignment, when compared to 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 or 32; or (ii) a full complement of the nucleic acid sequence of (i). In another embodiment, a recombinant DNA construct comprises a polynucleotide operably linked to at least one regulatory sequence (e.g., a promoter functional in a plant), wherein said polynucleotide encodes an SIPR polypeptide. The SIPR polypeptide may be from Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, Glycine max, Glycine tabacina, Glycine soja and Glycine tomentella. In another aspect, the present invention includes suppression DNA constructs. A suppression DNA construct may comprise at least one regulatory sequence (e.g., a promoter functional in a plant) operably linked to (a) all or part of: (i) a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence of at least 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity, based on the Clustal V method of alignment, when compared to SEQ ID NOS: 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32 or 34, or (ii) a full complement of the nucleic acid sequence of (a)(i); or (b) a region derived from all or part of a sense strand or antisense strand of a target gene of interest, said region having a nucleic acid sequence of at least 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 56%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity, based on the Clustal V method of alignment, when compared to said all or part of a sense strand or antisense strand from which said region is derived, and wherein said target gene of interest encodes an SIPR polypeptide; or (c) all or part of: (i) a nucleic acid sequence of at least 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 56%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity, based on the Clustal V method of alignment, when compared to 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 or 32, or (ii) a full complement of the nucleic acid sequence of (c)(i). The suppression DNA construct may comprise a cosuppression construct, antisense construct, viral-suppression construct, hairpin suppression construct, stem-loop suppression construct, double-stranded RNA-producing construct, RNAi construct, or small RNA construct (e.g., an siRNA construct or an miRNA construct). It is understood, as those skilled in the art will appreciate, that the invention encompasses more than the specific exemplary sequences. Alterations in a nucleic acid fragment which result in the production of a chemically equivalent amino acid at a given site, but do not affect the functional properties of the encoded polypeptide, are well known in the art. For example, a codon for the amino acid alanine, a hydrophobic amino acid, may be substituted by a codon encoding another less hydrophobic residue, such as glycine, or a more hydrophobic residue, such as valine, leucine, or isoleucine. Similarly, changes which result in substitution of one negatively charged residue for another, such as aspartic acid for glutamic acid, or one positively charged residue for another, such as lysine for arginine, can also be expected to produce a functionally equivalent product. Nucleotide changes which result in alteration of the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the polypeptide molecule would also not be expected to alter the activity of the polypeptide. Each of the proposed modifications is well within the routine skill in the art, as is determination of retention of biological activity of the encoded products. “Suppression DNA construct” is a recombinant DNA construct which when transformed or stably integrated into the genome of the plant, results in “silencing” of a target gene in the plant. The target gene may be endogenous or transgenic to the plant. “Silencing,” as used herein with respect to the target gene, refers generally to the suppression of levels of mRNA or protein/enzyme expressed by the target gene, and/or the level of the enzyme activity or protein functionality. The terms “suppression”, “suppressing” and “silencing”, used interchangeably herein, include lowering, reducing, declining, decreasing, inhibiting, eliminating or preventing, “Silencing” or “gene silencing” does not specify mechanism and is inclusive, and not limited to, anti-sense, cosuppression, viral-suppression, hairpin suppression, stern-loop suppression, RNAi-based approaches, and small RNA-based approaches. A suppression DNA construct may comprise a region derived from a target gene of interest and may comprise all or part of the nucleic acid sequence of the sense strand (or antisense strand) of the target gene of interest. Depending upon the approach to be utilized, the region may be 100% identical or less than 100% identical (e.g., at least 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical) to all or part of the sense strand (or antisense strand) of the gene of interest. Suppression DNA constructs are well-known in the art, are readily constructed once the target gene of interest is selected, and include, without limitation, cosuppression constructs, antisense constructs, viral-suppression constructs, hairpin suppression constructs, stem-loop suppression constructs, double-stranded RNA-producing constructs, and more generally, RNAi (RNA interference) constructs and small RNA constructs such as siRNA (short interfering RNA) constructs and miRNA (microRNA) constructs. “Antisense inhibition” refers to the production of antisense RNA transcripts capable of suppressing the expression of the target gene or gene product. “Antisense RNA” refers to an RNA transcript that is complementary to all or part of a target primary transcript or mRNA and that blocks the expression of a target isolated nucleic acid fragment (U.S. Pat. No. 5,107,065). The complementarity of an antisense RNA may be with any part of the specific gene transcript, i.e., at the 5° non-coding sequence, 3° non-coding sequence, introns, or the coding sequence. “Cosuppression” refers to the production of sense RNA transcripts capable of suppressing the expression of the target gene or gene product. “Sense” RNA refers to RNA transcript that includes the mRNA and can be translated into protein within a cell or in vitro. Cosuppression constructs in plants have been previously designed by focusing on overexpression of a nucleic acid sequence having homology to a native mRNA, in the sense orientation, which results in the reduction of all RNA having homology to the overexpressed sequence (see Vaucheret et al., Plant J. 16:651-659 (1998); and Gura, Nature 404:804-808 (2000)). Another variation describes the use of plant viral sequences to direct the suppression of proximal mRNA encoding sequences (POT Publication No, WO 98/36083 published on Aug. 20, 1998). RNA interference refers to the process of sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing in animals mediated by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Fire et al., Nature 391:806 (1998)). The corresponding process in plants is commonly referred to as post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) or RNA silencing and is also referred to as quelling in fungi. The process of post-transcriptional gene silencing is thought to be an evolutionarily-conserved cellular defense mechanism used to prevent the expression of foreign genes and is commonly shared by diverse flora and phyla (Fire et al., Trends Genet. 15:358 (1999)). Small RNAs play an important role in controlling gene expression. Regulation of many developmental processes, including flowering, is controlled by small RNAs. It is now possible to engineer changes in gene expression of plant genes by using transgenic constructs which produce small RNAs in the plant. Small RNAs appear to function by base-pairing to complementary RNA or DNA target sequences. When bound to RNA, small RNAs trigger either RNA cleavage or translational inhibition of the target sequence. When bound to DNA target sequences, it is thought that small RNAs can mediate DNA methylation of the target sequence. The consequence of these events, regardless of the specific mechanism, is that gene expression is inhibited. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs of about 19 to about 24 nucleotides (nt) in length that have been identified in both animals and plants (Lagos-Quintana et al., Science 294:853-858 (2001), Lagos-Quintana et al., Curr. Biol. 12:735-739 (2002); Lau et al., Science 294:858-862 (2001); Lee and Ambros, Science 294:862-864 (2001); Llave et al., Plant Cell 14:1605-1619 (2002); Mourelatos et al., Genes. Dev. 16:720-728 (2002); Park et al., Curr. Biol. 12:1484-1495 (2002); Reinhart et al., Genes. Dev. 16:1616-1626 (2002)). They are processed from longer precursor transcripts that range in size from approximately 70 to 200 nt, and these precursor transcripts have the ability to form stable hairpin structures. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) appear to regulate target genes by binding to complementary sequences located in the transcripts produced by these genes. In the case of lin-4 and let-7, the target sites are located in the 3′ UTRs of the target mRNAs (Lee et al., Cell 75:843-854 (1993); Wightman et al., Cell 75:855-862 (1993); Reinhart et al., Nature 403:901-906 (2000); Slack et al., Mol. Cell 5:659-669 (2000)), and there are several mismatches between the lin-4 and let-7 miRNAs and their target sites. Binding of the lin-4 or let-7 miRNA appears to cause downregulation of steady-state levels of the protein encoded by the target mRNA without affecting the transcript itself (Olsen and Ambros, Dev. Biol. 216:671-680 (1999)). On the other hand, recent evidence suggests that miRNAs can in some cases cause specific RNA cleavage of the target transcript within the target site, and this cleavage step appears to require 100% complementarity between the miRNA and the target transcript (Hutvagner and Zamore, Science 297:2056-2060 (2002); Llave et al., Plant Cell 14:1605-1619 (2002)). It seems likely that miRNAs can enter at least two pathways of target gene regulation: (1) protein downregulation when target complementarity is <100%; and (2) RNA cleavage when target complementarity is 100%. MicroRNAs entering the RNA cleavage pathway are analogous to the 21-25 nt short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated during RNA interference (RNAi) in animals and posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants, and likely are incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that is similar or identical to that seen for RNAi. Identifying the targets of miRNAs with bioinformatics has not been successful in animals, and this is probably due to the fact that animal miRNAs have a low degree of complementarity with their targets. On the other hand, bioinformatic approaches have been successfully used to predict targets for plant miRNAs (Llave et al., Plant Cell 14:1605-1619 (2002); Park et al., Curr. Biol. 12:1484-1495 (2002); Rhoades et al., Cell 110:513-520 (2002)), and thus it appears that plant miRNAs have higher overall complementarity with their putative targets than do animal miRNAs. Most of these predicted target transcripts of plant miRNAs encode members of transcription factor families implicated in plant developmental patterning or cell differentiation. Regulatory Sequences: A recombinant DNA construct (including a suppression DNA construct) of the present invention may comprise at least one regulatory sequence. A regulatory sequence may be a promoter. A number of promoters can be used in recombinant DNA constructs of the present invention. The promoters can be selected based on the desired outcome, and may include constitutive, tissue-specific, inducible, or other promoters for expression in the host organism. Promoters that cause a gene to be expressed in most cell types at most times are commonly referred to as “constitutive promoters”. High level, constitutive expression of the candidate gene under control of the 35S or UBI promoter may have pleiotropic effects, although candidate gene efficacy may be estimated when driven by a constitutive promoter. Use of tissue-specific and/or stress-specific promoters may eliminate undesirable effects but retain the ability to enhance drought tolerance. This effect has been observed in Arabidopsis (Kasuga et al. (1999) Nature Biotechnol. 17:287-91). Suitable constitutive promoters for use in a plant host cell include, for example, the core promoter of the Rsyn7 promoter and other constitutive promoters disclosed in WO 99/43838 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,072,050; the core CaMV 35S promoter (Odell et al., Nature 313:810-812 (1985)); rice actin (McElroy et al., Plant Cell 2:163-171 (1990)); ubiquitin (Christensen et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 12:619-632 (1989) and Christensen et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 18:675-689 (1992)); pEMU (Last et al., Theor. Appl. Genet. 81:581-588 (1991)); MAS (Velten et al., EMBO J. 3:2723-2730 (1984)); ALS promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,659,026), and the like. Other constitutive promoters include, for example, those discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,608,149; 5,608,144; 5,604,121; 5,569,597; 5,466,785; 5,399,680; 5,268,463; 5,608,142; and 6,177,611. In choosing a promoter to use in the methods of the invention, it may be desirable to use a tissue-specific or developmentally regulated promoter. A tissue-specific or developmentally regulated promoter is a DNA sequence which regulates the expression of a DNA sequence selectively in the cells/tissues of a plant critical to tassel development, seed set, or both, and limits the expression of such a DNA sequence to the period of tassel development or seed maturation in the plant. Any identifiable promoter may be used in the methods of the present invention which causes the desired temporal and spatial expression. Promoters which are seed or embryo-specific and may be useful in the invention include soybean Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (Kti3, Jofuku and Goldberg, Plant Cell 1:1079-1093 (1989)), patatin (potato tubers) (Rocha-Sosa, M., et al. (1989) EMBO J. 8:23-29), convicilin, vicilin, and legumin (pea cotyledons) (Rerie, W. G., et al. (1991) Mol. Gen. Genet. 259:149-157; Newbigin, E. J., et al. (1990) Planta 180:461-470; Higgins, T. J. V., et al. (1988) Plant. Mol. Biol. 11:683-695), zein (maize endosperm) (Schemthaner, J. P., et al. (1988) EMBO J. 7:1249-1255), phaseolin (bean cotyledon) (Segupta-Gopalan, C., et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82:3320-3324), phytohemagglutinin (bean cotyledon) (Voelker, T. et al. (1987) EMBO J. 6:3571-3577), B-conglycinin and glycinin (soybean cotyledon) (Chen, Z-L, et al. (1988) EMBO J. 7:297-302), glutelin (rice endosperm), hordein (barley endosperm) (Marris, C., et al. (1988) Plant Mol. Biol. 10:359-366), glutenin and gliadin (wheat endosperm) (Colot, V., et al. (1987) EMBO J. 6:3559-3564), and sporamin (sweet potato tuberous root) (Hattori. T., et al. (1990) Plant Mol. Biol. 14:595-604). Promoters of seed-specific genes operably linked to heterologous coding regions in chimeric gene constructions maintain their temporal and spatial expression pattern in transgenic plants. Such examples include Arabidopsis thaliana 2S seed storage protein gene promoter to express enkephalin peptides in Arabidopsis and Brassica napus seeds (Vanderkerckhove et al., Bio/Technology 7:L929-932 (1989)), bean lectin and bean beta-phaseolin promoters to express luciferase (Riggs et al., Plant Sci. 63:47-57 (1989)), and wheat glutenin promoters to express chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (Colot et al., EMBO J 6:3559-3564 (1987)). Inducible promoters selectively express an operably linked DNA sequence in response to the presence of an endogenous or exogenous stimulus, for example by chemical compounds (chemical inducers) or in response to environmental, hormonal, chemical, and/or developmental signals. Inducible or regulated promoters include, for example, promoters regulated by light, heat, stress, flooding or drought, phytohormones, wounding, or chemicals such as ethanol, jasmonate, salicylic acid, or safeners. Promoters for use in the current invention include the following: 1) the stress-inducible RD29A promoter (Kasuga et al. (1999) Nature Biotechnol. 17:287-91); 2) the barley promoter, B22E; expression of B22E is specific to the pedicel in developing maize kernels (“Primary Structure of a Novel Barley Gene Differentially Expressed in Immature Aleurone Layers”. Klemsdal, S. S. et al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 228(1/2):9-16 (1991)); and 3) maize promoter, Zag2 (“Identification and molecular characterization of ZAG1, the maize homolog of the Arabidopsis floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS”, Schmidt, R. J. et al., Plant Cell 5(7):729-737 (1993); “Structural characterization, chromosomal localization and phylogenetic evaluation of two pairs of AGAMOUS-like MADS-box genes from maize”, Theissen et al. Gene 156(2):155-166 (1995); NCBI GenBank Accession No. X80206)). Zag2 transcripts can be detected 5 days prior to pollination to 7 to 8 days after pollination (“DAP”), and directs expression in the carpel of developing female inflorescences and Ciml which is specific to the nucleus of developing maize kernels. Ciml transcript is detected 4 to 5 days before pollination to 6 to 8 DAP. Other useful promoters include any promoter which can be derived from a gene whose expression is maternally associated with developing female florets. Additional promoters for regulating the expression of the nucleotide sequences of the present invention in plants are stalk-specific promoters. Such stalk-specific promoters include the alfalfa S2A promoter (GenBank Accession No. EF030816; Abrahams et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 27:513-528 (1995)) and S2B promoter (GenBank Accession No. EF030817) and the like, herein incorporated by reference. Promoters may be derived in their entirety from a native gene, or be composed of different elements derived from different promoters found in nature, or even comprise synthetic DNA segments. Promoters for use in the current invention may include: RIP2, mLIP15, ZmCOR1, Rab17, CaMV 35S, RD29A, B22E, Zag2, SAM synthetase, ubiquitin, CaMV 19S, nos, Adh, sucrose synthase, R-allele, the vascular tissue preferred promoters S2A (Genbank accession number EF030816) and S2B (Genbank accession number EF030817), and the constitutive promoter GOS2 from Zea mays. Other promoters include root preferred promoters, such as the maize NAS2 promoter, the maize Cyclo promoter (US 2006/0156439, published Jul. 13, 2006), the maize ROOTMET2 promoter (WO05063998, published Jul. 14, 2005), the CR1BI0 promoter (WO06055487, published May 26, 2006), the CRWAQ81 (WO05035770, published Apr. 21, 2005) and the maize ZRP2.47 promoter (NCBI accession number: U38790; GI No. 1063664). Recombinant DNA constructs of the present invention may also include other regulatory sequences, including but not limited to, translation leader sequences, introns, and polyadenylation recognition sequences. In another embodiment of the present invention, a recombinant DNA construct of the present invention further comprises an enhancer or silencer. An intron sequence can be added to the 5′ untranslated region, the protein-coding region or the 3′ untranslated region to increase the amount of the mature message that accumulates in the cytosol. Inclusion of a spliceable intron in the transcription unit in both plant and animal expression constructs has been shown to increase gene expression at both the mRNA and protein levels up to 1000-fold.

Compositions: A composition of the present invention is a plant comprising in its genome any of the recombinant DNA constructs (including any of the suppression DNA constructs) of the present invention (such as any of the constructs discussed above). Compositions also include any progeny of the plant, and any seed obtained from the plant or its progeny, wherein the progeny or seed comprises within its genome the recombinant DNA construct (or suppression DNA construct).

The seeds may be maize seeds. The plant may be a monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous plant, for example, a maize or soybean plant, such as a maize hybrid plant or a maize inbred plant. The plant may also be sunflower, sorghum, canola, wheat, alfalfa, cotton, rice, barley or millet. The recombinant DNA construct may be stably integrated into the genome of the plant.

Any progeny of the above plants in embodiments 1-6, any seeds of the above plants in embodiments 1-6, any seeds of progeny of the above plants in embodiments 1-6, and cells from any of the above plants in embodiments 1-6 and progeny thereof. In any of the foregoing embodiments 1-7 or any other embodiments of the present invention, the SIPR polypeptide may be from Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, Glycine max, Glycine tabacina, Glycine soja or Glycine tomentella. In any of the foregoing embodiments 1-7 or any other embodiments of the present invention, the recombinant DNA construct (or suppression DNA construct) may comprise at least a promoter functional in a plant as a regulatory sequence. In any of the foregoing embodiments 1-7 or any other embodiments of the present invention, the alteration of at least one agronomic characteristic is either an increase or decrease. In any of the foregoing embodiments 1-7 or any other embodiments of the present invention, the at least one agronomic characteristic may be selected from the group consisting of greenness, yield, growth rate, biomass, fresh weight at maturation, dry weight at maturation, fruit yield, seed yield, total plant nitrogen content, fruit nitrogen content, seed nitrogen content, nitrogen content in a vegetative tissue, total plant free amino acid content, fruit free amino acid content, seed free amino acid content, free amino acid content in a vegetative tissue, total plant protein content, fruit protein content, seed protein content, protein content in a vegetative tissue, drought tolerance, nitrogen uptake, root lodging, harvest index, stalk lodging, plant height, ear height, ear length, early seedling vigor and seedling emergence under low temperature stress. For example, the alteration of at least one agronomic characteristic may be an increase in yield, greenness or biomass. In any of the foregoing embodiments 1-7 or any other embodiments of the present invention, the plant may exhibit the alteration of at least one agronomic characteristic when compared, under water limiting conditions, to a control plant not comprising said recombinant DNA construct (or said suppression DNA construct). “Drought” refers to a decrease in water availability to a plant that, especially when prolonged, can cause damage to the plant or prevent its successful growth (e.g., limiting plant growth or seed yield). “Drought tolerance” is a trait of a plant to survive under drought conditions over prolonged periods of time without exhibiting substantial physiological or physical deterioration. “Increased drought tolerance” of a plant is measured relative to a reference or control plant, and is a trait of the plant to survive under drought conditions over prolonged periods of time, without exhibiting the same degree of physiological or physical deterioration relative to the reference or control plant grown under similar drought conditions. Typically, when a transgenic plant comprising a recombinant DNA construct or suppression DNA construct in its genome exhibits increased drought tolerance relative to a reference or control plant, the reference or control plant does not comprise in its genome the recombinant DNA construct or suppression DNA construct. One of ordinary skill in the art is familiar with protocols for simulating drought conditions and for evaluating drought tolerance of plants that have been subjected to simulated or naturally-occurring drought conditions. For example, one can simulate drought conditions by giving plants less water than normally required or no water over a period of time, and one can evaluate drought tolerance by looking for differences in physiological and/or physical condition, including (but not limited to) vigor, growth, size, or root length, or in particular, leaf color or leaf area size. Other techniques for evaluating drought tolerance include measuring chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic rates and gas exchange rates. A drought stress experiment may involve a chronic stress (i.e., slow dry down) and/or may involve two acute stresses (i.e., abrupt removal of water) separated by a day or two of recovery. Chronic stress may last 8-10 days. Acute stress may last 3-5 days. The following variables may be measured during drought stress and well watered treatments of transgenic plants and relevant control plants: The variable “% area chg_start chronic-acute2” is a measure of the percent change in total area determined by remote visible spectrum imaging between the first day of chronic stress and the day of the second acute stress The variable “% area chg_start chronic-end chronic” is a measure of the percent change in total area determined by remote visible spectrum imaging between the first day of chronic stress and the last day of chronic stress The variable “% area chg_start chronic-harvest” is a measure of the percent change in total area determined by remote visible spectrum imaging between the first day of chronic stress and the day of harvest The variable “% area chg_start chronic-recovery24 hr” is a measure of the percent change in total area determined by remote visible spectrum imaging between the first day of chronic stress and 24 hrs into the recovery (24 hrs after acute stress 2) The variable “psii_acute1” is a measure of Photosystem II (PSII) efficiency at the end of the first acute stress period. It provides an estimate of the efficiency at which light is absorbed by PSII antennae and is directly related to carbon dioxide assimilation within the leaf. The variable “psii_acute2” is a measure of Photosystem II (PSII) efficiency at the end of the second acute stress period. It provides an estimate of the efficiency at which light is absorbed by PSII antennae and is directly related to carbon dioxide assimilation within the leaf. The variable “fv/fm_acute1” is a measure of the optimum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) at the end of the first acute stress-(variable fluorescence difference between the maximum and minimum fluorescence/maximum fluorescence) The variable “fv/fm_acute2” is a measure of the optimum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) at the end of the second acute stress-(variable flourescence difference between the maximum and minimum fluorescence/maximum fluorescence) The variable “leaf rolling_harvest” is a measure of the ratio of top image to side image on the day of harvest. The variable “leaf rolling_recovery24 hr” is a measure of the ratio of top image to side image 24 hours into the recovery. The variable “Specific Growth Rate (SGR)” represents the change in total plant surface area (as measured by Lemna Tec Instrument) over a single day (Y(t)=Y0*er*t). Y(t)=Y0*er*t is equivalent to % change in Y/Δt where the individual terms are as follows: Y(t)=Total surface area at t; Y0=Initial total surface area (estimated); r=Specific Growth Rate day−1, and t=Days After Planting (“DAP”) The variable “shoot dry weight” is a measure of the shoot weight 96 hours after being placed into a 104° C. oven The variable “shoot fresh weight” is a measure of the shoot weight immediately after being cut from the plant The Examples below describe some representative protocols and techniques for simulating drought conditions and/or evaluating drought tolerance. One can also evaluate drought tolerance by the ability of a plant to maintain sufficient yield (at least 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% yield) in field testing under simulated or naturally-occurring drought conditions (e.g., by measuring for substantially equivalent yield under drought conditions compared to non-drought conditions, or by measuring for less yield loss under drought conditions compared to a control or reference plant). One of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize a suitable control or reference plant to be utilized when assessing or measuring an agronomic characteristic or phenotype of a transgenic plant in any embodiment of the present invention in which a control plant is utilized (e.g., compositions or methods as described herein). For example, by way of non-limiting illustrations: 1. Progeny of a transformed plant which is hemizygous with respect to a recombinant DNA construct (or suppression DNA construct), such that the progeny are segregating into plants either comprising or not comprising the recombinant DNA construct (or suppression DNA construct): the progeny comprising the recombinant DNA construct (or suppression DNA construct) would be typically measured relative to the progeny not comprising the recombinant DNA construct (or suppression DNA construct) (i.e., the progeny not comprising the recombinant DNA construct (or the suppression DNA construct) is the control or reference plant). 2. Introgression of a recombinant DNA construct (or suppression DNA construct) into an inbred line, such as in maize, or into a variety, such as in soybean: the introgressed line would typically be measured relative to the parent inbred or variety line (i.e., the parent inbred or variety line is the control or reference plant). 3. Two hybrid lines, where the first hybrid line is produced from two parent inbred lines, and the second hybrid line is produced from the same two parent inbred lines except that one of the parent inbred lines contains a recombinant DNA construct (or suppression DNA construct): the second hybrid line would typically be measured relative to the first hybrid line (i.e., the first hybrid line is the control or reference plant). 4. A plant comprising a recombinant DNA construct (or suppression DNA construct): the plant may be assessed or measured relative to a control plant not comprising the recombinant DNA construct (or suppression DNA construct) but otherwise having a comparable genetic background to the plant (e.g., sharing at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity of nuclear genetic material compared to the plant comprising the recombinant DNA construct (or suppression DNA construct)). There are many laboratory-based techniques available for the analysis, comparison and characterization of plant genetic backgrounds; among these are Isozyme Electrophoresis, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (OAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP®s), and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) which are also referred to as Microsatellites. Furthermore, one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that a suitable control or reference plant to be utilized when assessing or measuring an agronomic characteristic or phenotype of a transgenic plant would not include a plant that had been previously selected, via mutagenesis or transformation, for the desired agronomic characteristic or phenotype.

Techniques for plant transformation and regeneration have been described in International Patent Publication WO 2009/006276, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. The development or regeneration of plants containing the foreign, exogenous isolated nucleic acid fragment that encodes a protein of interest is well known in the art. The regenerated plants may be self-pollinated to provide homozygous transgenic plants. Otherwise, pollen obtained from the regenerated plants is crossed to seed-grown plants of agronomically important lines. Conversely, pollen from plants of these important lines is used to pollinate regenerated plants. A transgenic plant of the present invention containing a desired polypeptide is cultivated using methods well known to one skilled in the art. EXAMPLES The present invention is further illustrated in the following Examples, in which parts and percentages are by weight and degrees are Celsius, unless otherwise stated. It should be understood that these Examples, while indicating embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only. From the above discussion and these Examples, one skilled in the art can ascertain the essential characteristics of this invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and modifications of the invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions. Thus, various modifications of the invention in addition to those shown and described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description. Such modifications are also intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. Example 1 Creation of an Arabidopsis Population with Activation-Tagged Genes An 18.5-kb T-DNA based binary construct was created, pHSbarENDs2 (FIG. 1; SEQ ID NO:1), that contains four multimerized enhancer elements derived from the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter (corresponding to sequences −341 to −64, as defined by Odell at al., Nature 313:810-812 (1985)). The construct also contains vector sequences (pUC9) and a polylinker to allow plasmid rescue, transposon sequences (Ds) to remobilize the T-DNA, and the bar gene to allow for glufosinate selection of transgenic plants. In principle, only the 10.8-kb segment from the right border (RB) to left border (LB) inclusive will be transferred into the host plant genome. Since the enhancer elements are located near the RB, they can induce cis-activation of genomic loci following T-DNA integration. Arabidopsis activation-tagged populations were created by whole plant Agrobacterium transformation. The pHSbarENDs2 construct was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58, grown in LB at 25° C. to OD600 H ˜1.0. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in an equal volume of 5% sucrose/0.05% Silwet L-77 (OSI Specialties, Inc). At early bolting, soil grown Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 were top watered with the Agrobacterium suspension. A week later, the same plants were top watered again with the same Agrobacteriurn strain in sucrose/Silwet. The plants were then allowed to set seed as normal. The resulting T1 seed were sown on soil, and transgenic seedlings were selected by spraying with glufosinate (Finale®; AgrEvo; Bayer Environmental Science). A total of 100,000 glufosinate resistant T1 seedlings were selected. T2 seed from each line was kept separate. Example 2 Screens to Identify Lines with Enhanced Drought Tolerance Quantitative Drought Screen: From each of 96,000 separate T1 activation-tagged lines, nine glufosinate resistant T2 plants are sown, each in a single pot on Scotts® Metro-Mix® 200 soil. Flats are configured with 8 square pots each. Each of the square pots is filled to the top with soil. Each pot (or cell) is sown to produce 9 glufosinate resistant seedlings in a 3×3 array. The soil is watered to saturation and then plants are grown under standard conditions (i.e., 16 hour light, 8 hour dark cycle; 22° C.; −60% relative humidity). No additional water is given. Digital images of the plants are taken at the onset of visible drought stress symptoms. Images are taken once a day (at the same time of day), until the plants appear dessicated. Typically, four consecutive days of data is captured. Color analysis is employed for identifying potential drought tolerant lines. Color analysis can be used to measure the increase in the percentage of leaf area that falls into a yellow color bin. Using hue, saturation and intensity data (“HSI”), the yellow color bin consists of hues 35 to 45. Maintenance of leaf area is also used as another criterion for identifying potential drought tolerant lines, since Arabidopsis leaves wilt during drought stress. Maintenance of leaf area can be measured as reduction of rosette leaf area over time. Leaf area is measured in terms of the number of green pixels obtained using the LemnaTec imaging system. Activation-tagged and control (e.g., wild-type) plants are grown side by side in flats that contain 72 plants (9 plants/pot). When wilting begins, images are measured for a number of days to monitor the wilting process. From these data wilting profiles are determined based on the green pixel counts obtained over four consecutive days for activation-tagged and accompanying control plants. The profile is selected from a series of measurements over the four day period that gives the largest degree of wilting. The ability to withstand drought is measured by the tendency of activation-tagged plants to resist wilting compared to control plants. LemnaTec HTSBonitUV software is used to analyze CCD images. Estimates of the leaf area of the Arabidopsis plants are obtained in terms of the number of green pixels. The data for each image is averaged to obtain estimates of mean and standard deviation for the green pixel counts for activation-tagged and wild-type plants. Parameters for a noise function are obtained by straight line regression of the squared deviation versus the mean pixel count using data for all images in a batch. Error estimates for the mean pixel count data are calculated using the fit parameters for the noise function. The mean pixel counts for activation-tagged and wild-type plants are summed to obtain an assessment of the overall leaf area for each image. The four-day interval with maximal wilting is obtained by selecting the interval that corresponds to the maximum difference in plant growth. The individual wilting responses of the activation-tagged and wild-type plants are obtained by normalization of the data using the value of the green pixel count of the first day in the interval. The drought tolerance of the activation-tagged plant compared to the wild-type plant is scored by summing the weighted difference between the wilting response of activation-tagged plants and wild-type plants over day two to day four; the weights are estimated by propagating the error in the data. A positive drought tolerance score corresponds to an activation-tagged plant with slower wilting compared to the wild-type plant. Significance of the difference in wilting response between activation-tagged and wild-type plants is obtained from the weighted sum of the squared deviations. Lines with a significant delay in yellow color accumulation and/or with significant maintenance of rosette leaf area, when compared to the average of the whole flat, are designated as Phase 1 hits. Phase 1 hits are re-screened in duplicate under the same assay conditions. When either or both of the Phase 2 replicates show a significant difference (score of greater than 0.9) from the whole flat mean, the line is then considered a validated drought tolerant line. Example 3 Identification of Activation-Tagged Genes Genes flanking the T-DNA insert in drought tolerant lines are identified using one, or both, of the following two standard procedures: (1) thermal asymmetric interlaced (TAIL) PCR (Liu et al., (1995), Plant J. 8:457-63); and (2) SAIFF PCR (Siebert et al., (1995) Nucleic Acids Res. 23:1087-1088). In lines with complex multimerized T-DNA inserts, TAIL PCR and SAIFF PCR may both prove insufficient to identify candidate genes. In these cases, other procedures, including inverse PCR, plasmid rescue and/or genomic library construction, can be employed. A successful result is one where a single TAIL or SAIFF PCR fragment contains a T-DNA border sequence and Arabidopsis genomic sequence. Once a tag of genomic sequence flanking a T-DNA insert is obtained, candidate genes are identified by alignment to publicly available Arabidopsis genome sequence. Specifically, the annotated gene nearest the 35S enhancer elements/T-DNA RB are candidates for genes that are activated. To verify that an identified gene is truly near a T-DNA and to rule out the possibility that the TAIL/SAIFF fragment is a chimeric cloning artifact, a diagnostic FOR on genomic DNA is done with one oligo in the T-DNA and one oligo specific for the candidate gene. Genomic DNA samples that give a PCR product are interpreted as representing a T-DNA insertion. This analysis also verifies a situation in which more than one insertion event occurs in the same line, e.g., if multiple differing genomic fragments are identified in TAIL and/or SAIFF PCR analyses. Example 4A Identification of Activation-Tagged SIPR Gene An activation-tagged line (No. 104159) showing drought tolerance was further analyzed. DNA from the line was extracted, and genes flanking the T-DNA insert in the mutant line were identified using SAIFF PCR (Siebert et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 23:1087-1088 (1995)). A PCR amplified fragment was identified that contained T-DNA border sequence and Arabidopsis genomic sequence. Genomic sequence flanking the T-DNA insert was obtained, and the candidate gene was identified by alignment to the completed Arabidopsis genome. For a given T-DNA integration event, the annotated gene nearest the 35S enhancer elements/T-DNA RB was the candidate for gene that is activated in the line. In the case of line 104159, the T-DNA landed in the codon sequence of At1g26796 (NCBI GI NO. 3766801) with the 35S enhancer elements pointing towards the candidate gene At1g26797 (SEQ ID NO: 17; NCBI GI No. 30689649), encoding an SIPR polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 18; NCBI GI No. 30689650). Example 4B Assay for Expression Level of Candidate Drought Tolerance Genes A functional activation-tagged allele should result in either up-regulation of the candidate gene in tissues where it is normally expressed, ectopic expression in tissues that do not normally express that gene, or both. Expression levels of the candidate genes in the cognate mutant line vs. wild-type are compared. A standard RT-PCR procedure, such as the QuantiTect® Reverse Transcription Kit from Qiagen®, is used. RT-PCR of the actin gene is used as a control to show that the amplification and loading of samples from the mutant line and wild-type are similar. Assay conditions are optimized for each gene. Expression levels are checked in mature rosette leaves. If the activation-tagged allele results in ectopic expression in other tissues (e.g., roots), it is not detected by this assay. As such, a positive result is useful but a negative result does not eliminate a gene from further analysis. Example 5 Validation of Arabidopsis Candidate Gene At1g126797 (SIPR Polypeptide) via Transformation into Arabidopsis Candidate genes can be transformed into Arabidopsis and overexpressed under the 35S promoter. If the same or similar phenotype is observed in the transgenic line as in the parent activation-tagged line, then the candidate gene is considered to be a validated “lead gene” in Arabidopsis. The candidate Arabidopsis SIPR gene (A11 g26797; SEQ ID NO; 17; NCBI GI No. 30689649) was tested for its ability to confer drought tolerance in the following manner. A 16.8-kb T-DNA based binary vector, called pBC-yellow (SEQ ID NO:4; FIG. 4), was constructed with a 1.3-kb 35S promoter immediately upstream of the INVITROGEN™ GATEWAY®C1 conversion insert. The vector also contains the RD29a promoter driving expression of the gene for ZS-Yellow (INVITROGEN™), which confers yellow fluorescence to transformed seed. The At1g26797 cDNA protein-coding region was amplified by RT-PCR with the following primers: (1) At1g26797-5′attB forward primer (SEQ ID NO: 12): ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggctccatgctaatcaca gttctag (2) At1g26797-3′attB reverse primer (SEQ ID NO: 13): ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggtcagtcaatctctaa gatgtcc The forward primer contains the attB1 sequence (ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCT; SEQ ID NO:10) and a consensus Kozak sequence (CAACA) adjacent to the first 19 nucleotides of the protein-coding region, beginning with the ATG start codon, of said cDNA. The reverse primer contains the attB2 sequence (ACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT; SEQ ID NO:11) adjacent to the reverse complement of the last 21 nucleotides of the protein-coding region, beginning with the reverse complement of the stop codon, of said cDNA. Using the INVITROGEN™ GATEWAY® CLONASE™ technology, a BP Recombination Reaction was performed with pDONR™/Zeo (SEQ ID NO:2; FIG. 2). This process removed the bacteria lethal ccdB gene, as well as the chloramphenicol resistance gene (CAM) from pDONR™/Zeo and directionally cloned the PCR product with flanking attB1 and attB2 sites creating an entry clone, PHP32324. This entry clone was used for a subsequent LR Recombination Reaction with a destination vector, as follows. A 16.8-kb 1-DNA based binary vector (destination vector), called pBC-yellow (SEQ ID NO:4; FIG. 4), was constructed with a 1.3-kb 35S promoter immediately upstream of the INVITROGEN™ GATEWAY® C1 conversion insert, which contains the bacterial lethal ccdB gene as well as the chloramphenicol resistance gene (CAM) flanked by attR1 and attR2 sequences. The vector also contains the RD29a promoter driving expression of the gene for ZS-Yellow (INVITROGEN™), which confers yellow fluorescence to transformed seed. Using the INVITROGEN™™ GATEWAY® technology, an LR Recombination Reaction was performed on the PHP32324 entry clone, containing the directionally cloned PCR product, and pBC-yellow. This allowed for rapid and directional cloning of the candidate gene behind the 35S promoter in pBC-yellow to create the 35S promoter:At1g26797 expression construct, pBC-Yellow-At1g26797. Applicants then introduced the 35S promoter::At1g26797 expression construct into wild-type Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0, using the same Agrobacterium-mediated transformation procedure described in Example 1. Transgenic T1 seeds were selected by yellow fluorescence, and T1 seeds were plated next to wild-type seeds and grown under water limiting conditions. Growth conditions and imaging analysis were as described in Example 2. R was found that the original drought tolerance phenotype from activation tagging could be recapitulated in wild-type Arabidopsis plants that were transformed with a construct where At1g26797 was directly expressed by the 35S promoter. The drought tolerance score, as determined by the method of Example 2, was 1.934. Example 6 Preparation of cDNA Libraries and Isolation and Sequencing of cDNA Clones cDNA libraries may be prepared by any one of many methods available. For example, the cDNAs may be introduced into plasmid vectors by first preparing the cDNA libraries in UNI-ZAP™ XR vectors according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, Calif.). The UNI-ZAP™ XR libraries are converted into plasmid libraries according to the protocol provided by Stratagene. Upon conversion, cDNA inserts will be contained in the plasmid vector pBLUESCRIPT®. In addition, the cDNAs may be introduced directly into precut BLUESCRIPT®II SK(+) vectors (Stratagene) using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), followed by transfection into DH10B cells according to the manufacturer's protocol (GIBCO BRL Products). Once the cDNA inserts are in plasmid vectors, plasmid DNAs are prepared from randomly picked bacterial colonies containing recombinant pBLUESCRIPT® plasmids, or the insert cDNA sequences are amplified via polymerase chain reaction using primers specific for vector sequences flanking the inserted cDNA sequences. Amplified insert DNAs or plasmid DNAs are sequenced in dye-primer sequencing reactions to generate partial cDNA sequences (expressed sequence tags or “ESTs”; see Adams et al., (1991) Science 252:1651-1656). The resulting ESTs are analyzed using a Perkin Elmer Model 377 fluorescent sequencer. Full-insert sequence (FIS) data is generated utilizing a modified transposition protocol. Clones identified for FIS are recovered from archived glycerol stocks as single colonies, and plasmid DNAs are isolated via alkaline lysis. Isolated DNA templates are reacted with vector primed M13 forward and reverse oligonucleotides in a PCR-based sequencing reaction and loaded onto automated sequencers. Confirmation of clone identification is performed by sequence alignment to the original EST sequence from which the FIS request is made. Confirmed templates are transposed via the Primer Island transposition kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) which is based upon the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ty1 transposable element (Devine and Boeke (1994) Nucleic Acids Res. 22:3765-3772). The in vitro transposition system places unique binding sites randomly throughout a population of large DNA molecules. The transposed DNA is then used to transform DH10B electro-competent cells (GIBCO BRL/Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.) via electroporation. The transposable element contains an additional selectable marker (named DHFR; Fling and Richards (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 11:5147-5158), allowing for dual selection on agar plates of only those subclones containing the integrated transposon. Multiple subclones are randomly selected from each transposition reaction, plasmid DNAs are prepared via alkaline lysis, and templates are sequenced (ABI PRISM® dye-terminator ReadyReaction mix) outward from the transposition event site, utilizing unique primers specific to the binding sites within the transposon. Sequence data is collected (ABI PRISM® Collections) and assembled using Phred and Phrap (Ewing et al. (1998) Genome Res. 8:175-185; Ewing and Green (1998) Genome Res. 8:186-194). Phred is a public domain software program which re-reads the ABI sequence data, re-calls the bases, assigns quality values, and writes the base calls and quality values into editable output files. The Phrap sequence assembly program uses these quality values to increase the accuracy of the assembled sequence contigs. Assemblies are viewed by the Consed sequence editor (Gordon et al. (1998) Genome Res. 8:195-202). In some of the clones the cDNA fragment may correspond to a portion of the 3′-terminus of the gene and does not cover the entire open reading frame. In order to obtain the upstream information one of two different protocols is used. The first of these methods results in the production of a fragment of DNA containing a portion of the desired gene sequence while the second method results in the production of a fragment containing the entire open reading frame. Both of these methods use two rounds of PCR amplification to obtain fragments from one or more libraries. The libraries some times are chosen based on previous knowledge that the specific gene should be found in a certain tissue and some times are randomly-chosen. Reactions to obtain the same gene may be performed on several libraries in parallel or on a pool of libraries. Library pools are normally prepared using from 3 to 5 different libraries and normalized to a uniform dilution. In the first round of amplification both methods use a vector-specific (forward) primer corresponding to a portion of the vector located at the 5′-terminus of the clone coupled with a gene-specific (reverse) primer. The first method uses a sequence that is complementary to a portion of the already known gene sequence while the second method uses a gene-specific primer complementary to a portion of the 3′-untranslated region (also referred to as UTR). In the second round of amplification a nested set of primers is used for both methods. The resulting DNA fragment is ligated into a pBLUESCRIPT® vector using a commercial kit and following the manufacturers protocol. This kit is selected from many available from several vendors including INVITROGEN™ (Carlsbad, Calif.), Promega Biotech (Madison, Wis.), and GIBCO-BRL (Gaithersburg, Md.). The plasmid DNA is isolated by alkaline lysis method and submitted for sequencing and assembly using Phred/Phrap, as above. Example 7 Identification of cDNA Clones cDNA clones encoding the polypeptide of interest can be identified by conducting BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool; Altschul et al. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410: see also the explanation of the BLAST algorithm on the world wide web site for the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health) searches for similarity to amino acid sequences contained in the BLAST “nr” database (comprising all non-redundant GenBank CDS translations, sequences derived from the 3-dimensional structure Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, the last major release of the SWISS-PROT protein sequence database, EMBL, and DDBJ databases). The DNA sequences from clones can be translated in all reading frames and compared for similarity to all publicly available protein sequences contained in the “nr” database using the BLASTX algorithm (Gish and States (1993) Nat. Genet. 3:266-272) provided by the NCBI. The polypeptides encoded by the cDNA sequences can be analyzed for similarity to all publicly available amino acid sequences contained in the “nr” database using the BLASTP algorithm provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). For convenience, the P-value (probability) or the E-value (expectation) of observing a match of a cDNA-encoded sequence to a sequence contained in the searched databases merely by chance as calculated by BLAST are reported herein as “pLog” values, which represent the negative of the logarithm of the reported P-value or E-value. Accordingly, the greater the pLog value, the greater the likelihood that the cDNA-encoded sequence and the BLAST “hit” represent homologous proteins. ESTs sequences can be compared to the Genbank database as described above. ESTs that contain sequences more 5- or 3-prime can be found by using the BLASTN algorithm (Altschul et al (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402.) against the DUPONT™ proprietary database comparing nucleotide sequences that share common or overlapping regions of sequence homology. Where common or overlapping sequences exist between two or more nucleic acid fragments, the sequences can be assembled into a single contiguous nucleotide sequence, thus extending the original fragment in either the 5 or 3 prime direction. Once the most 5-prime EST is identified, its complete sequence can be determined by Full Insert Sequencing as described above. Homologous genes belonging to different species can be found by comparing the amino acid sequence of a known gene (from either a proprietary source or a public database) against an EST database using the TBLASTN algorithm. The TBLASTN algorithm searches an amino acid query against a nucleotide database that is translated in all 6 reading frames. This search allows for differences in nucleotide codon usage between different species, and for codon degeneracy. Example 8 Characterization of cDNA Clones Encoding SIPR Polypeptides Shown in Table 1 (non-patent literature) and Table 2 (patent literature) are the BLASTP results for the Arabidopsis SIPR polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 18) and its homologs (SEQ ID NOS: 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32 and 34) described herein. SEQ ID NO: 30 is encoded by SEQ ID NO; 29, and is a truncated version of the publicly available Arabidopsis lyrata sequence presented in NCBI GI No. 297850998. Also shown are the percent sequence identity values for each pair of amino acid sequences: TABLE 1 BLASTP Results for SIPR polypeptides BLASTP Percent Sequence (Amino Acid) Reference pLog of Sequence (SEQ ID NO) (SEQ ID NO) E-value Identity SEQ ID NO: 30 NCBI GI NO: >180 100 297850998 (SEQ ID NO: 40) TABLE 2 BLASTP Results for SIPR polypeptides Percent BLASTP Se- Sequence (Amino-Acid) Reference pLog of quence (SEQ ID NO) (SEQ ID NO) E-value Identity At1g26797 SEQ ID NO: 18685 of 97 59.3 (SEQ ID NO: 18) EP1033405 (SEQ ID NO: 35) At1g26798 SEQ ID NO: 18685 of 105 60.9 (SEQ ID NO: 20) EP1033405 (SEQ ID NO: 35) At1g26796 SEQ ID NO: 18685 of 150 80.1 (SEQ ID NO: 22) EP1033405 (SEQ ID NO: 35) At1g26795 SEQ ID NO: 18685 of >180 100 (SEQ ID NO: 24) EP1033405 (SEQ ID NO: 35) At5g12060 SEQ ID NO: 49855 of >180 100 (SEQ ID NO: 26) EP2152891 (SEQ ID NO: 36) At3g55677 SEQ ID NO: 226 of 139 61.8 (SEQ ID NO: 28) EP1033405 (SEQ ID NO: 37) SEQ ID NO: 30 SEQ ID NO: 18685 of 112 62.3 EP1033405 (SEQ ID NO: 35) NCBI GI NO: 224118734 SEQ ID NO: 9 of 15.34 29.2 (SEQ ID NO: 32) US6855866 (SEQ ID NO: 38) NCBI GI NO: 270257838 SEQ ID NO: 12314 of 39 24.2 (SEQ ID NO: 34) EP2152891 (SEQ ID NO: 39) FIGS. 11A-11J present an alignment of the amino acid sequences of SIPR polypeptides set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34-40. FIG. 12 presents the percent sequence identities and divergence values for each sequence pair presented in FIGS. 11A-11J. Sequence alignments and percent identity calculations were performed using the Megalign® program of the LASERGENE® bioinformatics computing suite (DNASTAR® Inc., Madison, Wis.). Multiple alignment of the sequences was performed using the Clustal V method of alignment (Higgins and Sharp (1989) CABIOS. 5:151-153) with the default parameters (GAP PENALTY=10, GAP LENGTH PENALTY=10). Default parameters for pairwise alignments using the Clustal method were KTUPLE=1, GAP PENALTY=3, WINDOW=5 and DIAGONALS SAVED=5. Example 9 Preparation of a Plant Expression Vector Containing a Homolog to the Arabidopsis Lead Gene Sequences homologous to the Arabidopsis SIPR polypeptide can be identified using sequence comparison algorithms such as BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool; Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1993); see also the explanation of the BLAST algorithm on the world wide web site for the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health). Sequences encoding homologous SIPR polypeptides can be PCR-amplified by either of the following methods. Method 1 (RNA-based): If the 5′ and 3′ sequence information for the protein-coding region of a gene encoding a SIPR polypeptide homolog is available, gene-specific primers can be designed as outlined in Example 5. RT-PCR can be used with plant RNA to obtain a nucleic acid fragment containing the protein-coding region flanked by attB1 (SEQ ID NO:10) and attB2 (SEQ ID NO:11) sequences. The primer may contain a consensus Kozak sequence (CAACA) upstream of the start codon. Method 2 (DNA-based): Alternatively, if a cDNA clone is available for a gene encoding a SIPR polypeptide homolog, the entire cDNA insert (containing 5 and 3′ non-coding regions) can be PCR amplified. Forward and reverse primers can be designed that contain either the attB1 sequence and vector-specific sequence that precedes the cDNA insert or the attB2 sequence and vector-specific sequence that follows the cDNA insert, respectively. For a cDNA insert cloned into the vector pBulescript SK+, the forward primer VC062 (SEQ ID NO: 14) and the reverse primer VC063 (SEQ ID NO: 15) can be used. Methods 1 and 2 can be modified according to procedures known by one skilled in the art. For example, the primers of Method 1 may contain restriction sites instead of attB1 and attB2 sites, for subsequent cloning of the PCR product into a vector containing attB1 and attB2 sites. Additionally, Method 2 can involve amplification from a cDNA clone, a lambda clone, a BAC clone or genomic DNA. A PCR product obtained by either method above can be combined with the GATEWAY® donor vector, such as pDONR™/Zeo (INVITROGEN™; FIG. 2; SEQ ID NO:2) or pDONR™221 (INVITROGEN™; FIG. 3; SEQ ID NO:3), using a BP Recombination Reaction. This process removes the bacteria lethal ccdB gene, as well as the chloramphenicol resistance gene (CAM) from pDONR™221 and directionally clones the PCR product with flanking attB1 and attB2 sites to create an entry clone. Using the INVITROGEN™ GATEWAY®, CLONASE™ technology, the sequence encoding the homologous SIPR polypeptide from the entry clone can then be transferred to a suitable destination vector, such as pBC-Yellow (FIG. 4; SEQ ID NO:4), PHP27840 (FIG. 5; SEQ ID NO:5) or PHP23236 (FIG. 6; SEQ ID NO:6), to obtain a plant expression vector for use with Arabidopsis, soybean and corn, respectively. The attP1 and attP2 sites of donor vectors pDONR™/Zeo or pDONR™221 are shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, respectively. The attR1 and attR2 sites of destination vectors pBC-Yellow, PHP27840 and PHP23236 are shown in FIGS. 4, 5 and 6, respectively. Alternatively a MultiSite GATEWAY® LR recombination reaction between multiple entry clones and a suitable destination vector can be performed to create an expression vector. Example 10 Preparation of Soybean Expression Vectors and Transformation of Soybean with Validated Arabidopsis Lead Genes Soybean plants can be transformed to overexpress a validated Arabidopsis lead gene or the corresponding homologs from various species in order to examine the resulting phenotype. The same GATEWAY® entry clone described in Example 5 can be used to directionally clone each gene into the PHP27840 vector (SEQ ID NO:5; FIG. 5) such that expression of the gene is under control of the SCP1 promoter. Soybean embryos may then be transformed with the expression vector comprising sequences encoding the instant polypeptides. Techniques for soybean transformation and regeneration have been described in International Patent Publication WO 2009/006276, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. T1 plants can be subjected to a soil-based drought stress. Using image analysis, plant area, volume, growth rate and color analysis can be taken at multiple times before and during drought stress. Overexpression constructs that result in a significant delay in wilting or leaf area reduction, yellow color accumulation and/or increased growth rate during drought stress will be considered evidence that the Arabidopsis gene functions in soybean to enhance drought tolerance. Soybean plants transformed with validated genes can then be assayed under more vigorous field-based studies to study yield enhancement and/or stability under well-watered and water-limiting conditions. Example 11 Transformation of Maize with Validated Arabidopsis Lead Genes Using Particle Bombardment Maize plants can be transformed to overexpress a validated Arabidopsis lead gene or the corresponding homologs from various species in order to examine the resulting phenotype. The same GATEWAY® entry clone described in Example 5 can be used to directionally clone each gene into a maize transformation vector. Expression of the gene in the maize transformation vector can be under control of a constitutive promoter such as the maize ubiquitin promoter (Christensen et al., (1989) Plant Mol. Biol. 12:619-632 and Christensen et al., (1992) Plant Mol. Biol. 18:675-689) The recombinant DNA construct described above can then be introduced into corn cells by particle bombardment. Techniques for corn transformation by particle bombardment have been described in International Patent Publication WO 2009/006276, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. T1 plants can be subjected to a soil-based drought stress. Using image analysis, plant area, volume, growth rate and color analysis can be taken at multiple times before and during drought stress. Overexpression constructs that result in a significant delay in wilting or leaf area reduction, yellow color accumulation and/or increased growth rate during drought stress will be considered evidence that the Arabidopsis gene functions in maize to enhance drought tolerance. Example 12 Electroporation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 Electroporation competent cells (40 μL), such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 containing PHP10523 (FIG. 7; SEQ ID NO:7), are thawed on ice (20-30 min). PHP10523 contains VIR genes for 1-DNA transfer, an Agrobacterium low copy number plasmid origin of replication, a tetracycline resistance gene, and a Cos site for in vivo DNA bimolecular recombination. Meanwhile the electroporation cuvette is chilled on ice. The electroporator settings are adjusted to 2.1 kV. A DNA aliquot (0.5 μL parental DNA at a concentration of 0.2 μg-1.0 μg in low salt buffer or twice distilled H2O) is mixed with the thawed Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 cells while still on ice. The mixture is transferred to the bottom of electroporation cuvette and kept at rest on ice for 1-2 min. The cells are electroporated (Eppendorf electroporator 2510) by pushing the “pulse” button twice (ideally achieving a 4.0 millisecond pulse). Subsequently, 0.5 mL of room temperature 2×YT medium (or SOC medium) are added to the cuvette and transferred to a 15 mL snap-cap tube (e.g., FALCON™ tube). The cells are incubated at 28-30° C., 200-250 rpm for 3 h. Aliquots of 250 μL are spread onto plates containing YM medium and 50 μg/mL spectinomycin and incubated three days at 28-30 C. To increase the number of transformants one of two optional steps can be performed: Option 1: Overlay plates with 30 μl of 15 mg/mL rifampicin. LBA4404 has a chromosomal resistance gene for rifampicin. This additional selection eliminates some contaminating colonies observed when using poorer preparations of LBA4404 competent cells. Option 2: Perform two replicates of the electroporation to compensate for poorer electrocompetent cells. Identification of Transformants: Four independent colonies are picked and streaked on plates containing AB minimal medium and 50 μg/mL spectinomycin for isolation of single colonies. The plates are incubated at 28° C. for two to three days. A single colony for each putative co-integrate is picked and inoculated with 4 mL of 10 g/L bactopeptone, 10 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L sodium chloride and 50 mg/L spectinomycin. The mixture is incubated for 24 h at 28° C. with shaking. Plasmid DNA from 4 mL of culture is isolated using Qiagen® Miniprep and an optional Buffer PB wash. The DNA is eluted in 30 μL. Aliquots of 2 μL are used to electroporate 20 μL of DH10b+20 μL of twice distilled H2O as per above. Optionally a 15 μL aliquot can be used to transform 75-100 μL of INVITROGEN™ Library Efficiency DH5α. The cells are spread on plates containing LB medium and 50 μg/mL spectinomycin and incubated at 37° C. overnight. Three to four independent colonies are picked for each putative co-integrate and inoculated 4 mL of 2×YT medium (10 g/L bactopeptone, 10 yeast extract, 5 g/L sodium chloride) with 50 μg/mL spectinomycin. The cells are incubated at 37° C. overnight with shaking. Next, isolate the plasmid DNA from 4 mL of culture using QIAprep® Miniprep with optional Buffer PB wash (elute in 50 μL). Use 8 for digestion with SalI (using parental DNA and PHP10523 as controls). Three more digestions using restriction enzymes BamHI, EcoRI, and HindIII are performed for 4 plasmids that represent 2 putative co-integrates with correct SalI digestion pattern (using parental DNA and PHP10523 as controls). Electronic gels are recommended for comparison. Example 13 Transformation of Maize Using Agrobacterium Maize plants can be transformed to overexpress a validated Arabidopsis lead gene or the corresponding homologs from various species in order to examine the resulting phenotype. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of maize is performed essentially as described by Zhao et al. in Meth. Mol. Biol. 318:315-323 (2006) (see also Zhao et al., Mol. Breed. 8:323-333 (2001) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,981,840 issued Nov. 9, 1999, incorporated herein by reference). The transformation process involves bacterium innoculation, co-cultivation, resting, selection and plant regeneration. 1. Immature Embryo Preparation: Immature maize embryos are dissected from caryopses and placed in a 2 mL microtube containing 2 mL PHI-A medium. 2. Agrobacterium Infection and Co-Cultivation of Immature Embryos: 2.1 Infection Step: PHI-A medium of (1) is removed with 1 mL micropipettor, and 1 mL of Agrobacterium suspension is added. The tube is gently inverted to mix. The mixture is incubated for 5 min at room temperature. 2.2 Co-culture Step: The Agrobacterium suspension is removed from the infection step with a 1 mL micropipettor. Using a sterile spatula the embryos are scraped from the tube and transferred to a plate of PHI-B medium in a 100×15 mm Petri dish. The embryos are oriented with the embryonic axis down on the surface of the medium. Plates with the embryos are cultured at 20° C., in darkness, for three days. L-Cysteine can be used in the co-cultivation phase. With the standard binary vector, the co-cultivation medium supplied with 100-400 mg./L L-cysteine is critical for recovering stable transgenic events. 3. Selection of Putative Transgenic Events: To each plate of PHI-D medium in a 100×15 mm Petri dish, 10 embryos are transferred, maintaining orientation and the dishes are sealed with parafilm. The plates are incubated in darkness at 28° C. Actively growing putative events, as pale yellow embryonic tissue, are expected to be visible in six to eight weeks. Embryos that produce no events may be brown and necrotic, and little friable tissue growth is evident. Putative transgenic embryonic tissue is subcultured to fresh PHI-D plates at two-three week intervals, depending on growth rate. The events are recorded. 4. Regeneration of T0 plants: Embryonic tissue propagated on PHI-D medium is subcultured to PHI-E medium (somatic embryo maturation medium), in 100×25 mm Petri dishes and incubated at 28° C., in darkness, until somatic embryos mature, for about ten to eighteen days. Individual, matured somatic embryos with well-defined scutellum and coleoptile are transferred to PHI-F embryo germination medium and incubated at 28° C. in the light (about 80 μE from cool white or equivalent fluorescent lamps). In seven to ten days, regenerated plants, about 10 cm tall, are potted in horticultural mix and hardened-off using standard horticultural methods. Media for Plant Transformation: 1. PHI-A: 4 g/L CHU basal salts, 1.0 mL/L 1000× Eriksson's vitamin mix, 0.5 mg/L thiamin HCl, 1.5 mg/L 2,4-D, 0.69 g/L L-proline, 68.5 g/L sucrose, 36 g/L glucose, pH 5.2. Add 100 μM acetosyringone (filter-sterilized).2. PHI-B: PHI-A without glucose, increase 2,4-D to 2 mg/L, reduce sucrose to 30 g/L and supplement with 0.85 mg/L silver nitrate (filter-sterilized), 3.0 g/L Gelrite®, 100 μM acetosyringone (filter-sterilized), pH 5.8.3, PHI-C: PHI-B without Gelrite® and acetosyringonee, reduce 2,4-D to 1.5 mg/L and supplement with 8.0 g/L agar, 0.5 g/L 2-[N-morpholino]ethane-sulfonic acid (MES) buffer, 100 mg/L carbenicillin (filter-sterilized).4. PHI-D: PH-C supplemented with 3 mg/L bialaphos (filter-sterilized).5. PHI-E: 4.3 g/L of Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts, (Gibco, BRL 11117-074), 0.5 mg/L nicotinic acid, 0.1 mg/L thiamine HCl, 0.5 mg/L pyridoxine HCl, 2.0 mg/L glycine, 0.1 g/L myo-inositol, 0.5 mg/L zeatin (Sigma, Cat, No. Z-0164), 1 mg/L indole acetic acid (IAA), 26.4 μg/L abscisic acid (ABA), 60 g/L sucrose, 3 mg/L bialaphos (filter-sterilized), 100 mg/L carbenicillin (filter-sterilized), 8 g/L agar, pH 5.6.6. PHI-F: PHI-E without zeatin, IAA, ABA; reduce sucrose to 40 g/L; replacing agar with 1.5 g/L Gelrite®; pH 5.6. Plants can be regenerated from the transgenic callus by first transferring clusters of tissue to N6 medium supplemented with 0.2 mg per liter of 2,4-D. After two weeks the tissue can be transferred to regeneration medium (Fromm et al., Bio/Technology 8:833-839 (1990)). Transgenic T0 plants can be regenerated and their phenotype determined. T1 seed can be collected. Furthermore, a recombinant DNA construct containing a validated Arabidopsis gene can be introduced into an elite maize inbred line either by direct transformation or introgression from a separately transformed line. Transgenic plants, either inbred or hybrid, can undergo more vigorous field-based experiments to study yield enhancement and/or stability under water limiting and water non-limiting conditions. Subsequent yield analysis can be done to determine whether plants that contain the validated Arabidopsis lead gene have an improvement in yield performance (under water limiting or non-limiting conditions), when compared to the control (or reference) plants that do not contain the validated Arabidopsis lead gene. Specifically, water limiting conditions can be imposed during the flowering and/or grain fill period for plants that contain the validated Arabidopsis lead gene and the control plants. Plants containing the validated Arabidopsis lead gene would have less yield loss relative to the control plants, for example, at least 25% less yield loss, under water limiting conditions, or would have increased yield relative to the control plants under water non-limiting conditions. Example 14A Preparation of Arabidopsis Lead Gene (At1g26797) Expression Vector for Transformation of Maize Using INVITROGEN's™ GATEWAY® technology, an LR Recombination Reaction was performed with an entry clone (PHP32324) and a destination vector (PHP28647) to create the precursor plasmid PHP32330. The vector PHP32330 contains the following expression cassettes: 1. Ubiquitin promoter::moPAT::PinII terminator; cassette expressing the PAT herbicide resistance gene used for selection during the transformation process. 2. LTP2 promoter::DS-RED2::PinII terminator; cassette expressing the DS-RED color marker gene used for seed sorting. 3. Ubiquitin promoter::At-SIPR::PinII terminator; cassette overexpressing the gene of interest, Arabidopsis SIPR polypeptide. Example 14B Transformation of Maize with the Arabidopsis Lead Gene (At1g26797) Using Agrobacterium The SIPR polypeptide expression cassette present in vector PHP32330 can be introduced into a maize inbred line, or a transformable maize line derived from an elite maize inbred line, using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation as described in Examples 12 and 13. Vector PHP32330 can be electroporated into the LBA4404 Agrobacterium strain containing vector PHP10523 (FIG. 7; SEQ ID NO:7) to create the co-integrate vector PHP32412. The co-integrate vector is formed by recombination of the 2 plasmids, PHP32330 and PHP10523, through the COS recombination sites contained on each vector. The co-integrate vector PHP32412 contains the same 3 expression cassettes as above (Example 14A) in addition to other genes (TET, TET, TRFA, ORI terminator, CTL, ORI V, VIR C1, VIR C2, VIR G, VIR B) needed for the Agrobacterium strain and the Agrobacierium-mediated transformation. Example 15 Preparation of the Destination Vector PHP23236 for Transformation Into Gaspe Flint Derived Maize Lines Destination vector PHP23236 (FIG. 6, SEQ ID NO:6) was obtained by transformation of Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 containing plasmid PHP10523 (FIG. 7, SEQ ID NO:7) with plasmid PHP23235 (FIG. 8, SEQ ID NO:8) and isolation of the resulting co-integration product. Destination vector PHP23236, can be used in a recombination reaction with an entry done as described in Example 16 to create a maize expression vector for transformation of Gaspe Flint-derived maize lines. Example 16 Preparation of Plasmids for Transformation into Gaspe Flint Derived Maize Lines Using the INVITROGEN™ GATEWAY® LR Recombination technology, the protein coding region, described in Example 5, was directionally cloned into the destination vector PHP29634 (SEQ ID NO:16) to create an expression vector, PHP33118. Destination vector PHP29634 is similar to destination vector PHP23236; however, destination vector PHP29634 has site-specific recombination sites FRT1 and FRT87 and also encodes the GAT4602 selectable marker protein for selection of transformants using glyphosate. This expression vector contains the cDNA of interest, encoding the SIPR polypeptide, under control of the UBI promoter and is a T-DNA binary vector for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation into corn as described, but not limited to, the examples described herein. Example 17 Transformation of Gaspe Flint Derived Maize Lines with a Validated Arabidopsis Lead Gene Maize plants can be transformed to overexpress the Arabidopsis lead gene or the corresponding homologs from other species in order to examine the resulting phenotype. Recipient Plants: Recipient plant cells can be from a uniform maize line having a short life cycle (“fast cycling”), a reduced size, and high transformation potential. Typical of these plant cells for maize are plant cells from any of the publicly available Gaspe Flint (GBF) line varieties. One possible candidate plant line variety is the F1 hybrid of GBF×Q™ (Quick Turnaround Maize, a publicly available form of Gaspe Flint selected for growth under greenhouse conditions) disclosed in Tomes et al. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0221212. Transgenic plants obtained from this line are of such a reduced size that they can be grown in four inch pots (114 the space needed for a normal sized maize plant) and mature in less than 2.5 months. (Traditionally 3.5 months is required to obtain transgenic T0 seed once the transgenic plants are acclimated to the greenhouse.) Another suitable line is a double haploid line of GS3 (a highly transformable line) X Gaspe Flint. Yet another suitable line is a transformable elite inbred line carrying a transgene which causes early flowering, reduced stature, or both. Transformation Protocol: Any suitable method may be used to introduce the transgenes into the maize cells, including but not limited to inoculation type procedures using Agrobacterium based vectors. Transformation may be performed on immature embryos of the recipient (target) plant. Precision Growth and Plant Tracking: The event population of transgenic (T0) plants resulting from the transformed maize embryos is grown in a controlled greenhouse environment using a modified randomized block design to reduce or eliminate environmental error. A randomized block design is a plant layout in which the experimental plants are divided into groups (e.g., thirty plants per group), referred to as blocks, and each plant is randomly assigned a location with the block. For a group of thirty plants, twenty-four transformed, experimental plants and six control plants (plants with a set phenotype) (collectively, a “replicate group”) are placed in pots which are arranged in an array (a.k.a. a replicate group or block) on a table located inside a greenhouse. Each plant, control or experimental, is randomly assigned to a location with the block which is mapped to a unique, physical greenhouse location as well as to the replicate group. Multiple replicate groups of thirty plants each may be grown in the same greenhouse in a single experiment. The layout (arrangement) of the replicate groups should be determined to minimize space requirements as well as environmental effects within the greenhouse. Such a layout may be referred to as a compressed greenhouse layout. An alternative to the addition of a specific control group is to identify those transgenic plants that do not express the gene of interest. A variety of techniques such as RT-PCR can be applied to quantitatively assess the expression level of the introduced gene. T0 plants that do not express the transgene can be compared to those which do. Each plant in the event population is identified and tracked throughout the evaluation process, and the data gathered from that plant is automatically associated with that plant so that the gathered data can be associated with the transgene carried by the plant. For example, each plant container can have a machine readable label (such as a Universal Product Code (UPC) her code) which includes information about the plant identity, which in turn is correlated to a greenhouse location so that data obtained from the plant can be automatically associated with that plant. Alternatively any efficient, machine readable, plant identification system can be used, such as two-dimensional matrix codes or even radio frequency identification tags (RFID) in which the data is received and interpreted by a radio frequency receiver/processor. See U.S. Published Patent Application No. 200410122592, incorporated herein by reference. Phenotypic Analysis Using Three-Dimensional Imaging: Each greenhouse plant in the T0 event population, including any control plants, is analyzed for agronomic characteristics of interest, and the agronomic data for each plant is recorded or stored in a manner so that it is associated with the identifying data (see above) for that plant. Confirmation of a phenotype (gene effect) can be accomplished in the T1 generation with a similar experimental design to that described above. The T0 plants are analyzed at the phenotypic level using quantitative, non-destructive imaging technology throughout the plant's entire greenhouse life cycle to assess the traits of interest. A digital imaging analyzer may be used for automatic multi-dimensional analyzing of total plants. The imaging may be done inside the greenhouse. Two camera systems, located at the top and side, and an apparatus to rotate the plant, are used to view and image plants from all sides. Images are acquired from the top, front and side of each plant. All three images together provide sufficient information to evaluate the biomass, size and morphology of each plant. Due to the change in size of the plants from the time the first leaf appears from the soil to the time the plants are at the end of their development, the early stages of plant development are best documented with a higher magnification from the top. This may be accomplished by using a motorized zoom lens system that is fully controlled by the imaging software. In a single imaging analysis operation, the following events occur: (1) the plant is conveyed inside the analyzer area, rotated 360 degrees so its machine readable label can be read, and left at rest until its leaves stop moving; (2) the side image is taken and entered into a database; (3) the plant is rotated 90 degrees and again left at rest until its leaves stop moving, and (4) the plant is transported out of the analyzer. Plants are allowed at least six hours of darkness per twenty four hour period in order to have a normal day/night cycle. Imaging Instrumentation: Any suitable imaging instrumentation may be used, including but not limited to light spectrum digital imaging instrumentation commercially available from LemnaTec GmbH of Wurselen, Germany. The images are taken and analyzed with a LemnaTec Scanalyzer HTS LT-0001-2 having a ½″ IT Progressive Scan IEE CCD imaging device. The imaging cameras may be equipped with a motor zoom, motor aperture and motor focus. All camera settings may be made using LemnaTec software. For example, the instrumental variance of the imaging analyzer is less than about 5% for major components and less than about 10% for minor components. Software: The imaging analysis system comprises a LemnaTec HTS Bonit software program for color and architecture analysis and a server database for storing data from about 500,000 analyses, including the analysis dates. The original images and the analyzed images are stored together to allow the user to do as much reanalyzing as desired. The database can be connected to the imaging hardware for automatic data collection and storage. A variety of commercially available software systems (e.g. Matlab, others) can be used for quantitative interpretation of the imaging data, and any of these software systems can be applied to the image data set. Conveyor System: A conveyor system with a plant rotating device may be used to transport the plants to the imaging area and rotate them during imaging. For example, up to four plants, each with a maximum height of 1.5 m, are loaded onto cars that travel over the circulating conveyor system and through the imaging measurement area. In this case the total footprint of the unit (imaging analyzer and conveyor loop) is about 5 m×5 m. The conveyor system can be enlarged to accommodate more plants at a time. The plants are transported along the conveyor loop to the imaging area and are analyzed for up to 50 seconds per plant. Three views of the plant are taken. The conveyor system, as well as the imaging equipment, should be capable of being used in greenhouse environmental conditions. Illumination: Any suitable mode of illumination may be used for the image acquisition. For example, a top light above a black background can be used. Alternatively, a combination of top- and backlight using a white background can be used. The illuminated area should be housed to ensure constant illumination conditions. The housing should be longer than the measurement area so that constant light conditions prevail without requiring the opening and closing or doors. Alternatively, the illumination can be varied to cause excitation of either transgene (e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP), red fluorescent protein (RFP)) or endogenous (e.g. Chlorophyll) fluorophores. Biomass Estimation Based on Three-Dimensional Imaging: For best estimation of biomass the plant images should be taken from at least three axes, for example, the top and two side (sides 1 and 2) views. These images are then analyzed to separate the plant from the background, pot and pollen control bag (if applicable). The total area of the plant can be estimated by the calculation: [in-line-formulae]Estimated Total Plant Area(pixels)=Top Area(pixels)Side1Area(pixels) Side2Area(pixels)[/in-line-formulae] In the equation above the units of volume and area are ‘arbitrary units’. Arbitrary units are entirely sufficient to detect gene effects on plant size and growth in this system because what is desired is to detect differences (both positive-larger and negative-smaller) from the experimental mean, or control mean. The arbitrary units of size (e.g. area) may be trivially converted to physical measurements by the addition of a physical reference to the imaging process. For instance, a physical reference of known area can be included in both top and side imaging processes. Based on the area of these physical references a conversion factor can be determined to allow conversion from pixels to a unit of area such as square centimeters (cm2). The physical reference may or may not be an independent sample. For instance, the pot, with a known diameter and height, could serve as an adequate physical reference. Color Classification: The imaging technology may also be used to determine plant color and to assign plant colors to various color classes. The assignment of image colors to color classes is an inherent feature of the LemnaTec software. With other image analysis software systems color classification may be determined by a variety of computational approaches. For the determination of plant size and growth parameters, a useful classification scheme is to define a simple color scheme including two or three shades of green and, in addition, a color class for chlorosis, necrosis and bleaching, should these conditions occur. A background color class which includes non plant colors in the image (for example pot and soil colors) is also used and these pixels are specifically excluded from the determination of size. The plants are analyzed under controlled constant illumination so that any change within one plant over time, or between plants or different batches of plants (e.g. seasonal differences) can be quantified. In addition to its usefulness in determining plant size growth, color classification can be used to assess other yield component traits. For these other yield component traits additional color classification schemes may be used. For instance, the trait known as “staygreen”, which has been associated with improvements in yield, may be assessed by a color classification that separates shades of green from shades of yellow and brown (which are indicative of senescing tissues). By applying this color classification to images taken toward the end of the T0 or T1 plants' life cycle, plants that have increased amounts of green colors relative to yellow and brown colors (expressed, for instance, as Green/Yellow Ratio) may be identified. Plants with a significant difference in this Green/Yellow ratio can be identified as carrying transgenes which impact this important agronomic trait. The skilled plant biologist will recognize that other plant colors arise which can indicate plant health or stress response (for instance anthocyanins), and that other color classification schemes can provide further measures of gene action in traits related to these responses. Plant Architecture Analysis: Transgenes which modify plant architecture parameters may also be identified using the present invention, including such parameters as maximum height and width, internodal distances, angle between leaves and stem, number of leaves starting at nodes and leaf length. The LemnaTec system software may be used to determine plant architecture as follows. The plant is reduced to its main geometric architecture in a first imaging step and then, based on this image, parameterized identification of the different architecture parameters can be performed. Transgenes that modify any of these architecture parameters either singly or in combination can be identified by applying the statistical approaches previously described. Pollen Shed Date: Pollen shed date is an important parameter to be analyzed in a transformed plant, and may be determined by the first appearance on the plant of an active male flower. To find the male flower object, the upper end of the stem is classified by color to detect yellow or violet anthers. This color classification analysis is then used to define an active flower, which in turn can be used to calculate pollen shed date. Alternatively, pollen shed date and other easily visually detected plant attributes (e.g. pollination date, first silk date) can be recorded by the personnel responsible for performing plant care. To maximize data integrity and process efficiency this data is tracked by utilizing the same barcodes utilized by the LemnaTec light spectrum digital analyzing device. A computer with a barcode reader, a palm device, or a notebook PC may be used for ease of data capture recording time of observation, plant identifier, and the operator who captured the data. Orientation of the Plants: Mature maize plants grown at densities approximating commercial planting often have a planar architecture. That is, the plant has a clearly discernable broad side, and a narrow side. The image of the plant from the broadside is determined. To each plant a well defined basic orientation is assigned to obtain the maximum difference between the broadside and edgewise images. The top image is used to determine the main axis of the plant, and an additional rotating device is used to turn the plant to the appropriate orientation prior to starting the main image acquisition. Example 18 Evaluation of Gaspe Flint Derived Maize Lines for Drought Tolerance Transgenic Gaspe Flint derived maize lines containing the candidate gene can be screened for tolerance to drought stress in the following manner. Transgenic maize plants are subjected to well-watered conditions (control) and to drought-stressed conditions. Transgenic maize plants are screened at the T1 stage or later. For plant growth, the soil mixture consists of ⅓ TURFACE®, ⅓ SB300 and ⅓ sand. All pots are filled with the same amount of soil±10 grams. Pots are brought up to 100% field capacity (“FC”) by hand watering. All plants are maintained at 60% FC using a 20-10-20 (N-P-K) 125 ppm N nutrient solution. Throughout the experiment pH is monitored at least three times weekly for each table. Starting at 13 days after planting (DAP), the experiment can be divided into two treatment groups, well watered and reduce watered. All plants comprising the reduced watered treatment are maintained at 40% FC while plants in the well watered treatment are maintained at 80% FC. Reduced watered plants are grown for 10 days under chronic drought stress conditions (40% FC). All plants are imaged daily throughout chronic stress period. Plants are sampled for metabolic profiling analyses at the end of chronic drought period, 22 DAP. At the conclusion of the chronic stress period all plants are imaged and measured for chlorophyll fluorescence. Reduced watered plants are subjected to a severe drought stress period followed by a recovery period, 23-31 DAP and 32-34 DAP respectively. During the severe drought stress, water and nutrients are withheld until the plants reached 8% FC. At the conclusion of severe stress and recovery periods all plants are again imaged and measured for chlorophyll fluorescence. The probability of a greater Student's t Test is calculated for each transgenic mean compared to the appropriate null mean (either segregant null or construct null). A minimum (P<t) of 0.1 is used as a cut off for a statistically significant result. Example 18B Transformation and Evaluation of Maize Lines transformed with PHP32412 The SPR polypeptide expression cassette present in co-integrate vector PHP32412 was introduced into a transformable maize line derived from an elite maize inbred line as described in Examples 14A and 14B. Eight transformation events were screened for drought tolerance activity essentially as described in Example 2. Tables 3A-3C show the variables for each transgenic event that were significantly altered, as compared to the null segregants. A “positive effect” was defined as statistically significant improvement in that variable for the transgenic event relative to the null control. A “negative effect” was defined as a statistically significant improvement in that variable for the null control relative to the transgenic event. For the construct evaluated, PHP32412, the statistical value associated with each improved variable is presented in Table 3A-3C. A significant positive result had a P-value of less than or equal to 0.1 in a two-tailed test. The results for individual transformed maize lines are presented in Table 3A-3C. Tables 3A-3C indicate that one out of eight events showed a positive effect (increase) in Fv′/Fm′ (variable fluorescence difference between the maximum and minimum fluorescence/maximum fluorescence) (Table 3A) under non-stress conditions.

Example 19 Yield Analysis of Maize Lines with the Arabidopsis Lead Gene A recombinant DNA construct containing a validated Arabidopsis gene can be introduced into an elite maize inbred line either by direct transformation or introgression from a separately transformed line. Transgenic plants, either inbred or hybrid, can undergo more vigorous field-based experiments to study yield enhancement and/or stability under well-watered and water-limiting conditions. Subsequent yield analysis can be done to determine whether plants that contain the validated Arabidopsis lead gene have an improvement in yield performance under water-limiting conditions, when compared to the control plants that do not contain the validated Arabidopsis lead gene. Specifically, drought conditions can be imposed during the flowering and/or grain fill period for plants that contain the validated Arabidopsis lead gene and the control plants. Reduction in yield can be measured for both. Plants containing the validated Arabidopsis lead gene have less yield loss relative to the control plants, for example, at least 25% less yield loss. The above method may be used to select transgenic plants with increased yield, under water-limiting conditions and/or well-watered conditions, when compared to a control plant not comprising said recombinant DNA construct. Example 19B Yield Analysis of Maize Lines transformed with PHP32412 encoding the Arabidopsis Lead Gene At1g26797 The Self-incompatibility related polypeptide (SIPR expression cassette present in the co-integrate vector PHP32412 was introduced into a transformable maize line derived from an elite maize inbred line as described in Examples 14A and 14B. Ten transgenic events were field tested in 2009 at Johnston, Iowa (“JH”), York, Nebr. (“YK”), and Woodland, Calif. (“WO”). At the Woodland, Calif., location, drought conditions were imposed during flowering (“FS”; flowering stress) and during the grain fill period (“GFS”; grain fill stress). The JH location was well-watered, and the YK location did not experience drought. Yield data (bushel/acre; hu/ac) of the 10 transgenic events is shown in Table 4 together with the bulk null control (BN). Statistical significance is reported at P<0.1 for a one-tailed test. Four out of ten events had positive yield effect in the YK environment when compared to the Bulk Null (BN) control. Other locations did not show any significant yield reductions. One event E8266.07.7.3 showed positive effect (increase) in Fv′/Fm′ (example 18B) under normal conditions and also showed positive yield effect in the field.

Using INVITROGEN's™ GATEWAY® technology, an LR Recombination Reaction can be performed with an entry clone and a destination vector to create a precursor plasmid. The precursor plasmid contains the following expression cassettes: 1. Ubiquitin promoter::moPAT::PinII terminator; cassette expressing the PAT herbicide resistance gene used for selection during the transformation process. 2. LTP2 promoter::DS-RED2::PinII terminator; cassette expressing the DS-RED color marker gene used for seed sorting. 3. Ubiquitin promoter::Zm-SIPR polypeptide::PinII terminator; cassette overexpressing the gene of interest, maize SIPR polypeptide. Example 20B Transformation of Maize with Maize SIPR polypeptide Lead Gene Using Agrobacterium The maize SIPR polypeptide expression cassette present in the precursor plasmid described in example 20A can be introduced into a maize inbred line, or a transformable maize line derived from an elite maize inbred line, using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation as described in Examples 12 and 13. The precursor plasmid can be electroporated into the LBA4404 Agrobacterium strain containing vector PHP10523 (FIG. 7; SEQ ID NO:7) to create a co-integrate vector. The co-integrate vector is formed by recombination of the 2 plasmids, the precursor plasmid from example 20A and PHP10523, through the COS recombination sites contained on each vector. The co-integrate vector contains the same 3 expression cassettes as above (Example 20A) in addition to other genes (TET, TET, TRFA, ORI terminator, CTL, ORI V, VIR C1, VIR C2, VIR G, VIR B) needed for the Agrobacterium strain and the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Example 21 Preparation of Maize Expression Plasmids for Transformation into Gaspe Flint Derived Maize Lines A maize clone encoding a complete maize SPR homolog designated can be isolated. Using the INVITROGEN™ GATEWAY® Recombination technology described in Example 9, the clones encoding maize SIPR polypeptide homologs can be directionally cloned into the destination vector PHP23236 (SEQ ID NO:6; FIG. 6) to create expression vectors. Each expression vector contains the cDNA of interest under control of the UBI promoter and is a T-DNA binary vector for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation into corn as described, but not limited to, the examples described herein.
