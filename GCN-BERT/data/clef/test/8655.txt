Example 59A
Methyl 4-({[6-(difluoromethyl)-3-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl]carbonyl}amino)bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
188 mg (0.60 mmol) of the compound from Example 24A were initially charged in 2.0 ml of DMF. Successively, 158 mg (0.72 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride, 342 mg (0.90 mmol) of HATU and 0.42 ml (2.40 mmol) of DIPEA were added to the solution, and the mixture was subsequently stirred at 60Â° C. overnight. After cooling to RT, ethyl acetate and water were added to the mixture, and the phases were separated. The organic phase was washed once with water, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated and the residue was purified by column chromatography (80 g of silica gel Biotage Chromabond, mobile phase cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 2:1). This gave 117 mg (41% of theory, purity 99%) of the title compound
