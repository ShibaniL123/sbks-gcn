The present invention relates to a composition for washing and conditioning keratin materials, in particular keratin fibres, comprising one or more solid fatty alcohols, one or more first surfactants chosen from anionic surfactants, one or more second surfactants chosen from nonionic surfactants, and amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants, and to the use of the said composition for washing and conditioning keratin materials, in particular keratin fibres, and also to a process using the said composition. In the field of conditioning shampoos, a washing base is generally combined with a conditioning agent, which may be a cationic polymer, an amphoteric polymer, a silicone, a synthetic or natural oil, a fatty substance or a mixture thereof. These conditioning agents are used for improving the disentangling and softness of wet and dried hair, but may have a tendency to make the hair lank and dull. The use of insoluble conditioning agents is greatly limited: firstly due to the stabilization difficulties in detergent compositions, if it is desired to maintain the level of the working qualities (stability, latherability, start of lathering),secondly due to cosmetic defects in terms of the lank, charging and regreasing effect associated with coarse or heterogeneous dispersions in these same detergent compositions. Insoluble conditioning agents, in particular fatty alcohols, are known and used in shampoo compositions, especially in documents JP2002-20791, JP9-30938, US 2009/005 449 and US 2009/005 460. The document WO9825579 is also relevant in this context. However, these compositions do not have high-quality cosmetic performance especially in terms of disentangling and smoothing, and while maintaining the level of the working qualities. Thus, there is still a need to improve the cosmetic properties of washing compositions without having an impact on the lathering properties of the said compositions, or, even, while improving them. The Applicant has now discovered that the use of a combination of particular surfactants and solid fatty alcohols it is possible to overcome the drawbacks indicated above, and thus to obtain a composition that has improved cosmetic properties, in particular the smoothness, softness, suppleness and sheen. One subject of the invention is thus a composition, especially for washing or cleansing keratin materials, in particular keratin fibres, comprising: a) one or more anionic surfactants,b) one or more surfactants chosen from nonionic surfactants, and amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants, andc) one or more solid and branched fatty alcohols containing more than 25 carbon atoms. Another subject of the invention is the use of the said composition for washing, cleansing and conditioning keratin materials, in particular keratin fibres and more particularly the hair. A subject of the invention is also a process for washing or cleansing and conditioning keratin fibres using the composition according to the invention. Other subjects, characteristics, aspects and advantages of the invention will emerge even more clearly on reading the description and the various examples that follow. In the present patent application, a species is termed as being "anionic" when it bears at least one permanent negative charge or when it can be ionized as a negatively charged species, under the conditions of use of the compositions of the invention (for example the medium or the pH) and not comprising any cationic filler. In the present patent application, a species is termed as being "cationic" when it bears at least one permanent positive charge or when it can be ionized as a positively charged species, under the conditions of use of the compositions of the invention (for example the medium or the pH) and not comprising any anionic filler. A species is termed as being "nonionic" when it is neither cationic nor anionic within the meaning of the present patent application, in particular when it comprises no cationic or anionic groups within the meaning of the present patent application.
