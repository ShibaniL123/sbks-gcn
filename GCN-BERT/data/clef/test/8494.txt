AUSTRALIA Regulation 3.2 Patents Act 1990 Complete Specification Standard Patent APPLICANT: Baylor Research Institute Invention Title: ANTIGEN PRESENTING CELL TARGETED VACCINES The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method of performing it known to me: ANTIGEN PRESENTING CELL TARGETED VACCINES Technical Field of the Invention The present invention relates in general to the field of immunization, and more particularly, to novel anti-CD40 based vaccines. Background Art Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is described in connection with antigen presentation. One example of vaccines and methods for antigen presentation is taught in United States Patent No. 7,118,751, issued to Ledbetter, et al., for DNA vaccines encoding an amino-terminus antigen linked to a carboxy-terminus domain that binds CD40. Briefly, vaccines are taught that target one or more antigens to a cell surface receptor to improve the antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune response. Antigen(s) linked to a domain that binds to a cell surface receptor are internalized, carrying antigen(s) into an intracellular compartment where the antigen(s) are digested into peptides and loaded onto MHC molecules. Τ cells specific for the peptide antigens are activated, leading to an enhanced immune response. The vaccine may comprise antigen(s) linked to a domain that binds at least one receptor or a DNA plasmid encoding antigen(s) linked to a domain that binds at least one receptor. A preferred embodiment of the invention targets HIV-1 ℮ην antigen to the CD40 receptor, resulting in delivery of antigen to CD40 positive cells, and selective activation of the CD40 receptor on cells presenting HIV-1 env antigens to Τ cells. Another example is found in United States Patent Application No. 20080254026, filed by Li, et al., for antagonist anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies and methods for their use. Briefly, compositions and methods are disclosed for use in therapy for treating diseases mediated by stimulation of CD40 signaling on CD40-expressing cells are provided. The methods comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of an antagonist anti-CD40 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof to a patient in need thereof. The antagonist anti-CD40 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof is free of significant agonist activity, but exhibits antagonist activity when the antibody binds a CD40 antigen on a human CD40-expressing cell. Antagonist activity of the anti-CD40 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof beneficially inhibits proliferation and/or differentiation of human CD40-expressing cells, such as Β cells. Yet another example is taught in United States Patent Application No. 20080241139, filed by Delucia for an adjuvant combination comprising a microbial TLR agonist, a CD40 or 4-IBB agonist, and optionally an antigen and the use thereof for inducing a synergistic enhancement in cellular immunity. Briefly, this application is said to teach adjuvant combinations comprising at least one microbial TLR agonist such as a whole virus, bacterium or yeast or portion thereof such a membrane, spheroplast, cytoplast, or ghost, a CD40 or 4-IBB agonist and optionally an antigen wherein all 3 moieties may be separate or comprise the same recombinant microorganism or virus are disclosed. The use of these immune adjuvants for treatment of various chronic diseases such as cancers and HIV infection is also provided. United States Patent Application No. 20080199471, filed by Bemett, et al., is directed to optimized CD40 antibodies and methods of using the same. Briefly, this application is said to teach antibodies that target CD40, wherein the antibodies comprise at least one modification relative to a parent antibody, wherein the modification alters affinity to an FcyR or alters effector function as compared to the parent antibody. Also disclosed are methods of using the antibodies of the invention. Finally, United States Patent Application No. 20080181915, file by Tripp, et al., is directed to a CD40 ligand adjuvant for respiratory syncytial virus. Briefly, this application is said to teach methods and adjuvants for enhancing an immune response to RSV in a host, wherein the methods and adjuvants comprise a source of a CD40 binding protein. Preferably, the CD40 binding protein is CD40L and the source is a vector comprising a promoter operatively linked to a CD40L coding region. The enhanced immune response produced by the adjuvants and methods of the current invention includes both increased expression of Thl cytokines and increased production of antibody.

Figure 2 shows protein A affinity purified recombinant antibodies fused to various HIV peptides (Lanes 1 and.2) secreted from transfected 293F cells, then analyzed by reducing SDS.PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Figure 3 shows protein A affinity purified recombinant antibodies fused to various HIV peptide strings (Lanes 1 to 5) secreted from transfected 293F cells, then analyzed by reducing SDS.PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Figure 4 shows protein A affinity purified recombinant antibodies fused to various HIV peptide strings (Lanes 1 to 6) secreted from transfected 293F cells, then analyzed by reducing SDS.PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Figure 5 describes the protocol used in vitro to assay the potency of aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide fusion recombinant antibody (aCD40.LIPO5 rAb) to elicit the expansion of antigen-specific Τ cells in the context of a PBMC culture. Figure 6A-C shows HIV peptide-specific IFNy production in PBMCs from HIV patients incubated with various concentrations of anti-CD40.LIPO5 peptide string vaccine. C is the control group, which received no vaccine, and defines the baseline response of the culture to each peptide. Figure 7 is a summary of aCD40.LIPO5 peptide vaccine responses against the 5 peptide regions from 8 HIV patients. Figure 8A-C shows that the aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine elicits expansion of HIV peptide-specific Τ cells capable of secreting multiple cytokines - a desirable feature in a vaccine. Figure 8A-C also shows that the aCD40.LlPO5 HIV peptide vaccine elicits gag253, nef66, η℮Π16 and ρο1325 peptide-specific responses characterized by production of multiple cytokines (patient Α5). Figure 9 shows the protocol for testing aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine for its ability to direct the expansion of antigen-specific Τ cells resulting from targeted uptake by DCs and presentation of peptide epitopes on their surface MHC complex. Figure 10Α-Β shows the cytokine secretion in response to HIV peptides from DC-T cell co-cultures treated with various doses of aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine (patient A10). Figure 11 shows PBMCs from patient Α4 treated with the aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine elicit expansion of antigen-specific Τ cells with specificity to the gag253 region, but not to the flexible linker sequences. Figure 12Α is the aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine heavy chain sequence showing flexible linker regions in bold, joining sequences underlined and HIV peptide regions shaded in grey. Figure 12Α shows PBMCs from patient A3 treated with the aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine elicit expansion of antigen-specific Τ cells with specificities to the gag253, nef66, and η℮∩16 regions, but not to the flexible linker sequences. Figure 12Β-1-2 shows HIV antigen-specific Τ cell responses evoked from HIV patient Α17 PBMCs incubated with 30 ηΜ of three different H1V5 peptide DC targeting vaccines. Figure 12C-1 and C-2 is a similar study to that show in Figure 12Β-1 and Β-2, except that the PBMCs are from a different HIV patient (Α2). Figure 12D shows 15 different HIV peptide responses [5 peptide regions sampled in 3 patients], it was found that the anti-CD40.HIV5pep vaccine was superior to anti-DCIR.HIV5pep, anti-LOX-l.HIV5pep and non-LIP05 mix for eliciting a broad range of HIV peptide-specific CD8+ and CD4+ Τ responses. Figure 13 shows the internalization of anti-CD40 mAb:IL-4DC. lL-4DCs were treated with 500 ng/ml of anti-CD40-Alexa 568. Figure 14 shows CD4 and CD8 Τ cell proliferation by DCs targeted with anti-CD40-HA 1. 5χ10℮3 IFNDCs loaded with 2 ug/ml of anti-CD40-HA or control Ig-HAl were co-cultured with CFSE-labeled autologous CD4+ or CD8+ Τ cells (2χ10℮5) for 7 days. Cells were then then stained with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibodies. Cell proliferation was tested by measuring CFSE-dilution. Figure 15 shows a titration of ΗΑ1 fusion protein on CD4+ Τ proliferation. IFNDCs (5Κ) loaded with fusion proteins were co-cultured with CFSE-labeled CD4+ Τ cells (200Κ) for 7 days. Figure 16 shows IFNDCs targeted with anti-CD40-HAl activate HA 1-specific CD4+ Τ cells. CD4+ Τ cells were re-stimulated with DCs loaded with 5 uM of indicated peptides, and then intracellular IFNy was stained. Figure 17 shows IFNDCs targeted with anti-CD40-HA 1 activate HA 1-specific CD4+ Τ cells. CD4+ Τ cells were re-stimulated with DCs loaded with indicated peptides for 36h, and then culture supernatant was analyzed for measuring IFNy. Figure 18 shows that targeting CD40 results in enhanced cross-priming of MART-1 specific CD8+ Τ cells. IFNDCs (5ΚΛν℮11) loaded with fusion proteins were co-cultured with purified CD8+ Τ cells for 10 days. Cells were stained with anti-CD8 and tetramer. Cells are from healthy donors (HLA-A*0201+). Figure 19 shows targeting CD40 results in enhanced cross-priming of MART-1 specific CD8+ Τ cells (Summary of 8-repeated experiments using cells from different healthy donors). Figure 20 shows CD8+ CTL induced with IFNDCs targeted with anti-CD40-MART-l are functional. CD8+ Τ cells co-cultured with IFNDCs targeted with fusion proteins were mixed with Τ2 cells loaded with 10 uM peptide epitope. Figure 21 shows CD8+ CTL induced with IFNDCs targeted with anti-CD40-Flu Ml are functional. CD8+ Τ cells co-cultured with IFNDCs targeted with fusion proteins were mixed with Τ2 cells loaded with 1.0 ηΜ peptide epitope. Figure 22 shows an outline of protocol to test the ability a vaccine composed of anti-CD4012E12 linked to PSA (prostate specific antigen) to elicit the expansion from a naive Τ cell population. PSA-specific CD4+ Τ cells corresponding to a broad array of PSA epitopes. Briefly, DCs derived by culture with IFNa and GM-CSF of monocytes from a healthy donor are incubated with the vaccine. The next day, cells are placed in fresh medium and pure CD4+ Τ cells from the same donor are added. Several days later, PSA peptides are added and, after four hours, secreted gamma-IFN levels in the culture supernatants are determined. Figure 23 shows that many PSA peptides elicit potent gamma-IFN-production responses indicating that anti-CD4012E12 and similar anti-CD40 agents can efficiently deliver antigen to DCs, resulting in the priming of immune responses against multiple epitopes of the antigen. Figure 24 shows DCs targeted with anti-CD40-PSA induce PSA-specific CD8+ Τ cell responses. IFNDCs were targeted with 1 ug mAb fusion protein with PSA. Purified autologous CD8+ Τ cells were co-cultured for 10 days. Cells were stained with anti-CD8 and PSA (KLQCVDLHV)-tetramer. Cells are from a HLA-A*0201 positive healthy donor. The results demonstrate that anti-CD40 effectively deliver PSA to the DCs, which in turn elicit the expansion of PSA-specific CD8+ Τ cells.

Cells were then re-stimulated with with 5 uM of individual peptides derived from CyclinDl for 5h hi the presence of Brefeldin A. Cells were stained for measuring intracellular IFNy expression. Figure 26 shows a peptide scan and IFNy production by Τ cells obtained from the pools of peptides shown in Figure 25 and control for Donor 2. 5x10℮3 IFNDCs loaded with 2 ug/ml of anti-CD40-Cyclin D1 were co-cultured with purified autologous CD4+ Τ cells (2χ10℮5) for 8 days. Cells were then re-stimulated with 5 uM of individual peptides derived from CyclinDl for 5h in the presence of Brefeldin A. Cells were stained for measuring intracellular IFNy expression.

Description of the Invention While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention and do not delimit the scope of the invention. To facilitate the understanding of this invention, a number of terms are defined below. Terms defined herein have meanings as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the areas relevant to the present invention. Terms such as “a”, “an” and “the” are not intended to refer to only a singular entity, but include the general class of which a specific example may be used for illustration. The terminology herein is used to describe specific embodiments of the invention, but their usage does not delimit the invention, except as outlined in the claims. The invention includes also variants and other modification of an antibody (or “Ab”) of fragments thereof, e.g., anti-CD40 fusion protein (antibody is used interchangeably with the term “immunoglobulin”). As used herein, the term “antibodies or fragments thereof,” includes whole antibodies or fragments of an antibody, e.g., Fv, Fab, Fab’, F(ab’)2, Fc, and single chain Fv fragments (ScFv) or any biologically effective fragments of an immunoglobulins that binds specifically to, e.g., CD40. Antibodies from human origin or humanized antibodies have lowered or no immunogenicity in humans and have a lower number or no immunogenic epitopes compared to non-human antibodies. Antibodies and their fragments will generally be selected to have a reduced level or no antigenicity in humans. As used herein, the terms “Ag” or “antigen” refer to a substance capable of either binding to an antigen binding region of an immunoglobulin molecule or of eliciting an immune response, e.g., a Τ cellmediated immune response by the presentation of the antigen on Major Histocompatibility Antigen (MHC) cellular proteins. As used herein, “antigen” includes, but is not limited to, antigenic determinants, haptens, and immunogens which may be peptides, small molecules, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids or combinations thereof. The skilled immunologist will recognize that when discussing antigens that are processed for presentation to Τ cells, the term “antigen” refers to those portions of the antigen (e.g., a peptide fragment) that is a Τ cell epitope presented by MHC to the Τ cell receptor. When used in the context of a Β cell mediated immune response in the form of an antibody that is specific for an “antigen”, the portion of the antigen that binds to the complementarity determining regions of the variable domains of the antibody (light and heavy) the bound portion may be a linear or three-dimensional epitope. In the context of the present invention, the term antigen is used on both contexts, that is, the antibody is specific for a protein antigen (CD40), but also carries one or more peptide epitopes for presentation by MHC to Τ cells. In certain cases, the antigens delivered by the vaccine or fusion protein of the present invention are internalized and processed by antigen presenting cells prior to presentation, e.g., by cleavage of one or more portions of the antibody or fusion protein. As used herein, the term “antigenic peptide” refers to that portion of a polypeptide antigen that is specifically recognized by either B-cells or T-cells. B-cells respond to foreign antigenic determinants via antibody production, whereas T-lymphocytes are the mediate cellular immunity. Thus, antigenic peptides are those parts of an antigen that are recognized by antibodies, or in the context of an MHC, by T-cell receptors. As used herein, the term “epitope” refers to any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or of being presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) protein (e.g., Class I or Class II) to a T-cell receptor. Epitopic determinants are generally short peptides 5-30 amino acids long that fit within the groove of the MHC molecule that presents certain amino acid side groups toward the Τ cell receptor and has certain other residues in the groove, e.g., due to specific charge characteristics of the groove, the peptide side groups and the Τ cell receptor. Generally, an antibody specifically binds to an antigen when the dissociation constant is 1 mM, 100 ηΜ or even 10 ηΜ. As used herein, the term “vector” is used in two different contexts. When using the term “vector” with reference to a vaccine, a vector is used to describe a non-antigenic portion that is used to direct or deliver the antigenic portion of the vaccine. For example, an antibody or fragments thereof may be bound to or form a fusion protein with the antigen that elicits the immune response. For cellular vaccines, the vector for delivery and/or presentation of the antigen is the antigen presenting cell, which is delivered by the cell that is loaded with antigen. In certain cases, the cellular vector itself may also process and present the antigen(s) to Τ cells and activate an antigen-specific immune response. When used in the context of nucleic acids, a “vector” refers a construct which is capable of delivering, and preferably expressing, one or more genes or polynucleotide sequences of interest in a host cell. Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, viral vectors, naked DNA or RNA expression vectors, DNA or RNA expression vectors associated with cationic condensing agents, DNA or RNA expression vectors encapsulated in liposomes, and certain eukaryotic cells, such as producer cells. The compositions and methods of the present invention can be used with a wide variety of peptides and/or protein in which the antibody or fragment thereof and the peptide linker or “PL” create a protein that is stable and/or soluble. As used herein, the compositions and methods use an antigen delivery vector comprising the formula: Ab-(PL-Ag)x or Ab-(Ag-PL)v; wherein Ab is an antibody or fragment thereof; PL is at least one peptide linker comprising at least one glycosylation site; Ag is at least one viral antigen; and χ is an integer from 1 to 20. One example of an antibody for use with the present invention comprises at least the variable region of anti-CD40_12E12.3F3 (ATCC Accession No. PTA-9854), anti-CD40_12B4.2C10 (Deposit No. HS446, ATCC Accession No. ), and anti~CD40_llB6.1C3 (Deposit No. HS440, ATCC Accession No. ). As used herein, the terms “stable” and “unstable” when referring to proteins is used to describe a peptide or protein that maintains its three-dimensional structure and/or activity (stable) or that loses immediately or over time its three-dimensional structure and/or activity (unstable). As used herein, the term “insoluble” refers to those proteins that when produced in a cell (e.g., a recombinant protein expressed in a eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell or in vitro) are not soluble in solution absent the use of denaturing conditions or agents (e.g., heat or chemical denaturants, respectively). The antibody or fragment thereof and the linkers taught herein have been found to convert antibody fusion proteins with the peptides from insoluble and/or unstable into proteins that are stable and/or soluble. Another example of stability versus instability is when the domain of the protein with a stable conformation has a higher melting temperature (Tm) than the unstable domain of the protein when measured in the same solution. A domain is stable compared to another domain when the difference in the Tm is at least about 2° C, more preferably about 4° C, still more preferably about 7° C, yet more preferably about 10° C, even more preferably about 15° C, still more preferably about 20° C, even still more preferably about 25° C, and most preferably about 30° C, when measured in the same solution. As used herein, “polynucleotide” or “nucleic acid” refers to a strand of deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides in either a single- or a double-stranded form (including known analogs of natural nucleotides). A double-stranded nucleic acid sequence will include the complementary sequence. The polynucleotide sequence may encode variable and/or constant region domains of immunoglobulin that are formed into a fusion protein with one or more linkers. For use with the present invention, multiple cloning sites (MCS) may be engineered into the locations at the carboxy-terminal end of the heavy and/or light chains of the antibodies to allow for in-frame insertion of peptide for expression between the linkers. As used herein, the term “isolated polynucleotide” refers to a polynucleotide of genomic, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof. By virtue of its origin the “isolated polynucleotide” (1) is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the “isolated polynucleotides” are found in nature, (2) is operably linked to a polynucleotide which it is not linked to in nature, or (3) does not occur in nature as part of a larger sequence. The skilled artisan will recognize that to design and implement a vector having the formula Ab-(PL-Ag)x or Ab-(Ag-PL)x, can be manipulated at the nucleic acid level by using techniques known in the art, such as those taught in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2007 by John Wiley and Sons, relevant portions incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, the Ab, Ag and PL encoding nucleic acid sequences can be inserted using polymerase chain reaction, enzymatic insertion of oligonucleotides or polymerase chain reaction fragments in a vector, which may be an expression vector. To facilitate the insertion of (PL-Ag)x or (Ag-PL)x at the carboxy terminus of the antibody light chain, the heavy chain, or both, a multiple cloning site (MCS) may be engineered in sequence with the antibody sequences. As used herein, the term “polypeptide” refers to a polymer of amino acids and does not refer to a specific length of the product; thus, peptides, oligopeptides, and proteins are included within the definition of polypeptide. This term also does not refer to or exclude post expression modifications of the polypeptide, for example, glycosylations, acetylations, phosphorylations and the like. Included within the definition are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino acids, etc.), polypeptides with substituted linkages, as well as other modifications known in the art, both naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring. The term “domain,” or “polypeptide domain” refers to that sequence of a polypeptide that folds into a single globular region in its native conformation, and that may exhibit discrete binding or functional properties. [0100] A polypeptide or amino acid sequence “derived from” a designated nucleic acid sequence refers to a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence identical to that of a polypeptide encoded in the sequence, or a portion thereof wherein the portion consists of at least 3-5 amino acids, preferably at least 4-7 amino acids, more preferably at least 8-10 amino acids, and even more preferably at least 11-15 amino acids, or which is immunologically identifiable with a polypeptide encoded in the sequence. This terminology also includes a polypeptide expressed from a designated nucleic acid sequence. [0101] As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to any material that when combined with an immunoglobulin (Ig) fusion protein of the present invention allows the Ig to retain biological activity and is generally non-reactive with the subject’s immune system. Examples include, but are not limited to, standard pharmaceutical earners such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions such as an oil/water emulsion, and various types of wetting agents. Certain diluents may be used with the present invention, e.g., for aerosol or parenteral administration, that may be phosphate buffered saline or normal (0.85%) saline. [0102] The invention provides an CD40 binding molecule comprising at least one immunoglobulin light chain variable domain (VL) which comprises in sequence hypervariable regions CDR1L, CDR2L and CDR3l, the CDRlLhaving the amino acid sequence SASQGISNYLN (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:41) the CDR2L having the amino acid sequence YTSILHS (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:42) and the CDR3L having the amino acid sequence QQFNKLPPT (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:43) the amino acid sequences of which are shown in SEQ ID NO. 37; and direct equivalent thereof. [0103] Accordingly the invention provides an CD40 binding molecule which comprises an antigen binding site comprising at least one immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain (Vh) which comprises in sequence hypervariable regions CDR1H, CDR2H and CDR3H, the CDR1H having the amino acid sequence GFTFSDYYMY (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:44), the CDR2H having the amino acid sequence YINSGGGSTYYPDTVKG (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:45), and the CDR3H having the amino acid sequence RGLPFHAMDY (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:46), the amino acid sequences of which are shown in SEQ ID NO. 38; and direct equivalents thereof. [0104] In one aspect the invention provides a single domain CD40 binding molecule comprising an isolated immunoglobulin light chain comprising a heavy chain variable domain (VL) as defined above. In another aspect the invention provides a single domain CD40 binding molecule comprising an isolated immunoglobulin heavy chain comprising a heavy chain variable domain (VH) as defined above. [0105] In another aspect the invention also provides an CD40 binding molecule comprising both heavy (VH) and light chain (VL) variable domains in which the CD40 binding molecule comprises at least one antigen binding site comprising: a) an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain (Vl) which comprises in sequence hypervariable regions CDR1L, CDR2L and CDR3L, the CDR1L having the amino acid sequence SASQGISNYLN (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:41), the CDR2L having the amino acid sequence YTSILHS (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:42), and the CDR3L having the amino acid sequence QQFNKLPPT (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:43), the amino acid sequences of which are shown in SEQ ID. NO. 1, and b) an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain (VH) which comprises in sequence hypervariable regions CDR1H, CDR2H and CDR3h, the CDRln having the amino acid sequence GFTFSDYYMY (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:44), the CDR2' having the amino acid sequence YINSGGGSTYYPDTVKG (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:45), and the CDR3H having the amino acid sequence RGLPFHAMDY (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:46), the amino acid sequences of which are shown in SEQ ID NO. 38; and direct equivalents thereof. [0106] Unless otherwise indicated, any polypeptide chain is herein described as having an amino acid sequence starting at the N-terminal end and ending at the C-terminal end. When the antigen binding site comprises both the VH and VL domains, these may be located on the same polypeptide molecule or, preferably, each domain may be on a different chain, the VH domain being part of an immunoglobulin heavy chain or fragment thereof and the VL being part of an immunoglobulin light chain or fragment thereof. [0107] Non-limiting examples for antigens targeted by the antibodies of the present invention include, but are not limited to: cell surface marker selected from MHC class I, MHC class II, CD1, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD lib, CD14, CD15, CD16, CD 19, CD20, CD29, CD31, CD40,CD43, CD44, CD45, CD54, CD56, CD57, CD58, CD83, CD86, CMRF-44, CMRF-56, DCIR, DC-ASPGR, CLEC-6, CD40, BDCA-2, MARCO, DEC-205, mannose receptor, Langerin, DECTIN-1, Β7-1, Β7-2, IFN-y receptor and IL-2 receptor, ICAM-1, Fey receptor, Τ cell receptors, lectins, or other immune cell receptors. In one specific example, the antigens that are targeted by the antibody portion of the present invention are specifically expressed by antigen presenting cells, e.g., dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, macrophages, and Β cells. [0108] As used herein, the term “CD40 binding molecule” refers to any molecule capable of binding to the CD40 antigen either alone or associated with other molecules having one or more the VL and VH CDRs taught herein, in some cases 2, 3, 4, 5, or all 6 CDRs. The binding reaction may be shown by standard methods (qualitative assays) including, for example, a bioassay for determining by blocking the binding of other molecules to CD40 or any kind of binding or activity assays (e.g., activation, reduction or modulation of an immune response), with reference to a negative control test in which an antibody of unrelated specificity but of the same isotype, e.g., an anti-CD25 or anti-CD80 antibody, is used. [0109] The present invention may also be made into a single chain antibody having the variable domains of the heavy and light chains of an antibody covalently bound by a peptide linker usually including from 10 to 30 amino acids, preferably from 15 to 25 amino acids. Therefore, such a structure does not include the constant part of the heavy and light chains and it is believed that the small peptide spacer should be less antigenic than a whole constant part. [0110] As used herein, the term “chimeric antibody” refers to an antibody in which the constant regions of heavy or light chains or both are of human origin while the variable domains of both heavy and light chains are of non-human (e.g., mouse, hamster or rat) origin or of human origin but derived from a different human antibody. [0111] As used herein, the term “CDR-grafted antibody” refers to an antibody in which the hypervariable complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are derived from a donor antibody, such as a non-human (e.g., mouse) antibody or a different human antibody, while all or substantially all the other parts of the immunoglobulin (e.g., the conserved regions of the variable domains, i.e., framework regions), are derived from an acceptor antibody (in the case of a humanized antibody -an antibody of human origin). A CDR-grafted antibody may include a few amino acids of the donor sequence in the framework regions, for instance in the parts of the framework regions adjacent to the hypervariable regions. [0112] As used herein, the term “human antibody” refers to an antibody in which the constant and variable regions of both the heavy and light chains are all of human origin, or substantially identical to sequences of human origin, not necessarily from the same antibody and includes antibodies produced by mice in which the mouse, hamster or rat immunoglobulin variable and constant part genes have been replaced by their human counterparts, e.g. as described in general terms in ΕΡ 0546073 Bl, U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,806, U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,825, U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,126, U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,425, U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,016, U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,429, ΕΡ 0 438474 Bl and ΕΡ 0 463151 Bl, relevant portions incorporated herein by reference. [0113] The CD40 binding molecule of the invention can be a humanized antibody that comprises the CDRs obtained from the anti-CD40_12E12.3F3, the anti-CD4011B6.1C3, or the anti-CD40_12B4.2C10 antibodies. One example of a chimeric antibody includes the variable domains of both heavy and light chains are of human origin, for instance those variable domains of the anti-CD40_12E12.3F3 antibody that are part of SEQ ID NO.: 148 and SEQ ID NO.: 149, anti-CD40_12B4.2C10 in SEQ ID NO.: 150 and SEQ ID NO.: 151 or SEQ ID NO.: 152, and/or anti-CD40_11B6.1C3, SEQ ID NO.: 153 and SEQ ID NO.: 154, or combination thereof. The constant region domains preferably also comprise suitable human constant region domains, for instance as described in “Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest”, Kabat Ε. A. et al, US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institute of Health. The nucleic acid sequences can be found in, e.g., SEQ ID NOS.: 8 and 9. [0114] Hypervariable regions may be associated with any kind of framework regions, e.g., of human origin. Suitable framework regions were described Kabat Ε. A. One heavy chain framework is a heavy chain framework, for instance that of anti-CD40_12E12.3F3 antibody that are part of SEQ ID NO.: 149; anti-CD40_12B4.2C10 - SEQ ID NO.: 151 or SEQ ID NO.: 152, and/or anti-CD40_llB6.1C3 - SEQ ID NO.: 154, or combination thereof, e.g., FR1L, FR2L, FR3L and FR4L regions. In a similar manner, SEQ ID NO. 148 shows the anti-CD40_12E12.3F3 (or the equivalents for anti-CD40_12B4.2C10 and anti-CD40_11B6.1C3, SEQ ID NOS.: 150 and 153, respectively) heavy chain framework that includes the sequence of FR1H, FR2H, FR3H and FR4H regions. The CDRs may be added to a human antibody framework, such as those described in 7,456,260, issued to Rybak, et al., which teach new human variable chain framework regions and humanized antibodies comprising the framework regions, relevant portions and framework sequences incorporated herein by reference. To accomplish the engraftment at a genetic level, the present invention also includes the underlying nucleic acid sequences for the VL AND VH regions as well as the complete antibodies and the humanized versions thereof. The nucleic acid sequences of the present invention include SEQ ID NOS.: 155 and 156, which are the anti-CD40 antibody light and the heavy chains, respectively, as well as those nucleic acid sequences that include variable codon usage for the same amino acid sequences and conservative variations thereof having 85, 90, 95 or 100 % sequence identity at the nucleic or amino acid level. Likewise, the CDRs may have 85, 90, 95 or 100 % sequence identity at the nucleic or amino acid level, individually, in groups or 2, 3, 4 or 5 or all together. [0115] Monoclonal antibodies raised against a protein naturally found in all humans are typically developed in a non-human system e.g. in mice, and as such are typically non-human proteins. As a direct consequence of this, a xenogenic antibody as produced by a hybridoma, when administered to humans, elicits an undesirable immune response that is predominantly mediated by the constant part of the xenogenic immunoglobulin. Xenogeneic antibodies tend to elicit a host immune response, thereby limiting the use of such antibodies as they cannot be administered over a prolonged period of time. Therefore, it is particularly useful to use single chain, single domain, chimeric, CDR-grafted, or especially human antibodies that are not likely to elicit a substantial allogenic response when administered to humans. The present invention includes antibodies with minor changes in an amino acid sequence such as deletion, addition or substitution of one, a few or even several ammo acids which are merely allelic forms of the original protein having substantially identical properties. [0116] The inhibition of the binding of CD40 to its receptor may be conveniently tested in various assays including such assays are described hereinafter in the text. By the teim “to the same extent” is meant that the reference and the equivalent molecules exhibit, on a statistical basis, essentially identical CD40 binding inhibition curves in one of the assays referred to above. For example, the assay used may be an assay of competitive inhibition of binding of CD40 by the binding molecules of the invention. [0117] Generally, the human anti-CD40 antibody comprises at least: (a) one light chain which comprises a variable domain having an amino acid sequence substantially identical to that shown in SEQ ID NO. 1 starting with the amino acid at position 1 and ending with the amino acid at position 107 and the constant part of a human light chain; and (b) one heavy chain which comprises a variable domain having an amino acid sequence substantially identical to that shown in SEQ ID NO. 2 and the constant part of a human heavy chain. The constant part of a human heavy chain may be of the γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4, μ, β2, or δ or ε type, preferably of the y-type, whereas the constant part of a human light chain may be of the κ or λ type (which includes the λΐ, λ2 and λ3 subtypes) but is preferably of the κ type. The amino acid sequences of the general locations of the variable and constant domains are well known in the art and generally follow the Kabat nomenclature. [0118] A CD40 binding molecule of the invention may be produced by recombinant DNA techniques. In view of this, one or more DNA molecules encoding the binding molecule must be constructed, placed under appropriate control sequences and transferred into a suitable host organism for expression. [0119] In a very general manner, there are accordingly provided: (i) DNA molecules encoding a single domain CD40 binding molecule of the invention, a single chain CD40 binding molecule of the invention, a heavy or light chain or fragments thereof of a CD40 binding molecule of the invention; and (ii) the use of the DNA molecules of the invention for the production of a CD40 binding molecule of the invention by recombinant methods. [0120] The present state of the art is such that the skilled worker in the art can synthesize the DNA molecules of the invention given the information provided herein, i.e., the amino acid sequences of the hypervariable regions and the DNA sequences coding for them. A method for constructing a variable domain gene is for example described in ΕΡΑ 239 400, relevant portions incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, a gene encoding a variable domain of a MAb is cloned. The DNA segments encoding the framework and hypervariable regions are determined and the DNA segments encoding the hypervariable regions are removed so that the DNA segments encoding the framework regions are fused together with suitable restriction sites at the junctions. The restriction sites may be generated at the appropriate positions by mutagenesis of the DNA molecule by standard procedures. Double stranded synthetic CDR cassettes are prepared by DNA synthesis according to the sequences given in SEQ ID NO. 1 and 3 or 2 and 4 (amino acid and nucleic acid sequences, respectively). These cassettes are often provided with sticky ends so that they can be ligated at the junctions of the framework. [0121] It is not necessary to have access to the mRNA from a producing hybridoma cell line in order to obtain a DNA construct coding for the CD40 binding molecules of the invention. For example, PCT application WO 90/07861 gives full instructions for the production of an antibody by recombinant DNA techniques given only written information as to the nucleotide sequence of the gene, relevant portions incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, the method comprises the synthesis of a number of oligonucleotides, their amplification by the PCR method, and their splicing to give the desired DNA sequence. [0122] Expression vectors comprising a suitable promoter or genes encoding heavy and light chain constant parts are publicly available. Thus, once a DNA molecule of the invention is prepared it may be conveniently transferred in an appropriate expression vector. DNA molecules encoding single chain antibodies may also be prepared by standard methods, for example, as described in WO 88/1649. In view of the foregoing, no hybridoma or cell line deposit is necessary to comply with the criteria of sufficiency of description. [0123] For example, first and second DNA constructs are made that bind specifically to CD40. Briefly, a first DNA construct encodes a light chain or fragment thereof and comprises a) a first part which encodes a variable domain comprising alternatively framework and hypervariable regions, the hypervariable regions being in sequence CDR1L, CDR2L and CDR3L the amino acid sequences of which are shown in SEQ ID NO. 1; this first part starting with a codon encoding the first amino acid of the variable domain and ending with a codon encoding the last amino acid of the variable domain, and b) a second part encoding a light chain constant part or fragment thereof which starts with a codon encoding the first amino acid of the constant part of the heavy chain and ends with a codon encoding the last amino acid of the constant part or fragment thereof, followed by a stop codon. [0124] The first part encodes a variable domain having an amino acid sequence substantially identical to the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO. 1. A second part encodes the constant part of a human heavy chain, more preferably the constant part of the human γ1 chain. This second part may be a DNA fragment of genomic origin (comprising introns) or a cDNA fragment (without introns). [0125] The second DNA construct encodes a heavy chain or fragment thereof and comprises a) a first part which encodes a variable domain comprising alternatively framework and hypervariable regions; the hypervariable regions being CDR1H and optionally CDR2H and CDR3H, the amino acid sequences of which are shown in SEQ ID NO. 2; this first part starting with a codon encoding the first amino acid of the variable domain and ending with a codon encoding the last amino acid of the variable domain, and b) a second part encoding a heavy chain constant part or fragment thereof which starts with a codon encoding the first amino acid of the constant part of the light chain and ends with a codon encoding the last amino acid of the constant part or fragment thereof followed by a stop codon. [0126] The first part encodes a variable domain having an amino acid sequence substantially identical to the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO. 2. The first part has the nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO. 2 starting with the nucleotide at position 1 and ending with the nucleotide at position 321. Also preferably the second part encodes the constant part of a human light chain, more preferably the constant part of the human κ chain. [0127] The invention also includes CD40 binding molecules in which one or more of the residues of CDR1l, CDR2l, CDR3l, CDR1h, CDR2h or CDR3H or the frameworks, typically only a few (e.g. FR1-4l or η), are changed from the residues shown in SEQ ID NO. 37 and SEQ ID NO. 38; by, e.g., site directed mutagenesis of the corresponding DNA sequences. The invention includes the DNA sequences coding for such changed CD40 binding molecules. In particular the invention includes a CD40 binding molecules in which one or more residues of CDR1L, CDR2l and/or CDR3L have been changed from the residues shown in SEQ ID NO. 37 and one or more residues of CDR1H, CDR2H and/or CDR3H have been changed from the residues shown in SEQ ID NO. 38. [0128] Each of the DNA constructs are placed under the control of suitable control sequences, in particular under the control of a suitable promoter. Any kind of promoter may be used, provided that it is adapted to the host organism in which the DNA constructs will be transferred for expression. However, if expression is to take place in a mammalian cell, an immunoglobulin gene promoter may be used in Β cells. The first and second parts may be separated by an intron, and, an enhancer may be conveniently located in the intron between the first and second parts. The presence of such an enhancer that is transcribed but not translated, may assist in efficient transcription. In particular embodiments the first and second DNA constructs comprise the enhancer of, e.g., a heavy chain human gene. [0129] The desired antibody may be produced in a cell culture or in a transgenic animal. A suitable transgenic animal may be obtained according to standard methods that include micro injecting into eggs the first and second DNA constructs placed under suitable control sequences transferring the so prepared eggs into appropriate pseudo-pregnant females and selecting a descendant expressing the desired antibody. [0130] The invention also provides an expression vector able to replicate in a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell line, which comprises at least one of the DNA constructs above described. Each expression vector containing a DNA construct is then transferred into a suitable host organism. When the DNA constructs are separately inserted on two expression vectors, they may be transferred separately, i.e. one type of vector per cell, or co-transferred, this latter possibility being preferred. A suitable host organism may be a bacterium, a yeast or a mammalian cell line, this latter being preferred. More preferably, the mammalian cell line is of lymphoid origin, e.g., a myeloma, hybridoma or a normal immortalized Βcell, which conveniently does not express any endogenous antibody heavy or light chain. [0131] When the antibody chains are produced in a cell culture, the DNA constructs must first be inserted into either a single expression vector or into two separate but compatible expression vectors, the latter possibility being preferred. For expression in mammalian cells it is preferred that the coding sequence of the CD40 binding molecule is integrated into the host cell DNA within a locus which permits or favors high level expression of the CD40 binding molecule. [0132] In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the product of a CD40 binding molecule that comprises: (i) culturing an organism which is transformed with an expression vector as defined above; and (ii) recovering the CD40 binding molecule from the culture. [0133] In accordance with the present invention it has been found that the anti-CD40_12E12.3F3, anti-CD40_12B4.2C10 and/or anti-CD4011B6.1C3 antibody appears to have binding specificity for the antigenic epitope of human CD40. It is therefore most surprising that antibodies to this epitope, e.g. the anti-CD40_12E12.3F3 antibody, are capable of delivering antigen efficiently into dendritic cells (DCs). Antibodies, in particular chimeric and CDR-grafted antibodies and especially human antibodies, which have binding specificity for the antigenic epitope of mature human CD40; and use of such antibodies for DC antigen loading are novel and are included within the scope of the present invention. [0134] To use the anti-CD40 antibody of the present invention for treatment indications, the appropriate dosage will, of course, vary depending upon, for example, the antibody disclosed herein to be employed, the host, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the condition being treated. However, in prophylactic use, satisfactory results are generally found at dosages from about 0.05 mg to about 10 mg per kilogram body weight more usually from about 0.1 mg to about 5 mg per kilogram body weight. The frequency of dosing for prophylactic uses will normally be in the range from about once per week up to about once every 3 months, more usually in the range from about once every 2 weeks up to about once every 10 weeks, e.g., once every 4 to 8 weeks. The anti-CD40 antibody of the present can be administered parenterally, intravenously, e.g., into the antecubital or other peripheral vein, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. [0135] Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be manufactured in conventional manner, e.g., in a lyophilized form. For immediate administration it is dissolved in a suitable aqueous carrier, for example sterile water for injection or sterile buffered physiological saline. If it is considered desirable to make up a solution of larger volume for administration by infusion rather as a bolus injection, it is advantageous to incorporate human serum albumin or the patient's own heparinized blood into the saline at the time of formulation. The presence of an excess of such physiologically inert protein prevents loss of antibody by adsorption onto the walls of the container and tubing used with the infusion solution. If albumin is used, a suitable concentration is from 0.5 to 4.5% by weight of the saline solution. [0136] One embodiment of the present invention provides an immunoconjugate comprising a humanized antibody of the invention, e.g., a humanized anti-CD40 antibody, linked to one or more effector molecules, antigen(s) and/or a detectable label(s). Preferably, the effector molecule is a therapeutic molecule such as, for example, one or more peptides that comprise one or more Τ cell epitopes, a toxin, a small molecule, a cytokine or a chemokine, an enzyme, or a radiolabel. [0137] Exemplary toxins include, but are not limited to, Pseudomonas exotoxin or diphtheria toxin. Examples of small molecules include, but are not limited to, chemotherapeutic compounds such as taxol, doxorubicin, etoposide, and bleiomycin. Exemplary cytokines include, but are not limited to, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-12, IL-17, and IL-25. Exemplary enzymes include, but are not limited to, RNAses, DNAses, proteases, kinases, and caspases. Exemplary radioisotopes include, but are not limited to, 32P and 125I. [0138] As used herein, the term “epitope” refers to a molecule or substance capable of stimulating an immune response. In one example, epitopes include but are not limited to a polypeptide and a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide, wherein expression of the nucleic acid into a polypeptide is capable of stimulating an immune response when the polypeptide is processed and presented on a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule. Generally, epitopes include peptides presented on the surface of cells non-covalently bound to the binding groove of Class I or Class II MHC, such that they can interact with Τ cell receptors and the respective Τ cell accessory molecules. [0139] Proteolytic Processing of Antigens. Epitopes that are displayed by MHC on antigen presenting cells are cleavage peptides or products of larger peptide or protein antigen precursors. For MHC I epitopes, protein antigens are often digested by proteasomes resident in the cell. Intracellular proteasomal digestion produces peptide fragments of about 3 to 23 amino acids in length that are then loaded onto the MHC protein. Additional proteolytic activities within the cell, or in the extracellular milieu, can trim and process these fragments further. Processing of MHC Class II epitopes generally occurs via intracellular proteases from the lysosonial/endosomal compartment. The present invention includes, in one embodiment, pre-processed peptides that are attached to the anti-CD40 antibody (or fragment thereof) that directs the peptides against which an enhanced immune response is sought directly to antigen presenting cells. [0140] To identify epitopes potentially effective as immunogenic compounds, predictions of MHC binding alone are useful but often insufficient. The present invention includes methods for specifically identifying the epitopes within antigens most likely to lead to the immune response sought for the specific sources of antigen presenting cells and responder Τ cells. [0141] The present invention allows for a rapid and easy assay for the identification of those epitopes that are most likely to produce the desired immune response using the patient’s own antigen presenting cells and Τ cell repertoire. The compositions and methods of the present invention are applicable to any protein sequence, allowing the user to identify the epitopes that are capable of binding to MHC and are properly presented to Τ cells that will respond to the antigen. Accordingly, the invention is not limited to any particular target or medical condition, but instead encompasses and MHC epitope(s) from any useful source. [0142] As used herein, the term “veneered” refers to a humanized antibody framework onto which antigen-binding sites or CDRs obtained from non-human antibodies (e.g., mouse, rat or hamster), are placed into human heavy and light chain conserved structural framework regions (FRs), for example, in a light chain or heavy chain polynucleotide to “graft” the specificity of the non-human antibody into a human framework. The polynucleotide expression vector or vectors that express the veneered antibodies can be transfected mammalian cells for the expression of recombinant human antibodies which exhibit the antigen specificity of the non-human antibody and will undergo posttranslational modifications that will enhance their expression, stability, solubility, or combinations thereof.

[0146] Antigenic targets that may be delivered using the anti-CD40-antigen vaccines of the present invention include genes encoding antigens such as viral antigens, bacterial antigens, fungal antigens or parasitic antigens. Pathogens include trypanosomes, tapeworms, roundworms, helminthes, malaria. Tumor markers, such as fetal antigen or prostate specific antigen, may be targeted in this manner. Other examples include: HIV env proteins and hepatitis Β surface antigen. Administration of a vector according to the present invention for vaccination purposes would require that the vector-associated antigens be sufficiently non-immunogenic to enable long-term expression of the transgene, for which a strong immune response would be desired. In some cases, vaccination of an individual may only be required infrequently, such as yearly or biennially, and provide long-term immunologic protection against the infectious agent. Specific examples of organisms, allergens and nucleic and amino sequences for use in vectors and ultimately as antigens with the present invention may be found in U.S. Patent No. 6,541,011, relevant portions incorporated herein by reference, in particular, the tables that match organisms and specific sequences that may be used with the present invention.

[0150] Antigen that can be targeted using the anti-CD40-antigen vaccines of the present invention will generally be selected based on a number of factors, including: likelihood of internalization, level of immune cell specificity, type of immune cell targeted, level of immune cell maturity and/or activation and the like. In this embodiment, the antibodies may be mono- or bi-specific antibodies that include one anti-CD40 binding domain and one binding domain against a second antigen, e.g., cell surface markers for dendritic cells such as, MHC class I, MHC Class II, Β7-2, CD 18, CD29, CD31, CD43, CD44, CD45, CD54, CD58, CD83, CD86, CMRF-44, CMRF-56, DCIR and/or Dectin-1 and the like; while in some cases also having the absence of CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD 14, CD 15, CD 16, CD 19, CD20, CD56, and/or CD57. Examples of cell surface markers for antigen presenting cells include, but are not limited to, MHC class I, MHC Class II, CD45, Β7-1, Β7-2, IFN-y receptor and IL-2 receptor, ICAM-1 and/or Fey receptor. Examples of cell surface markers for Τ cells include, but are not limited to, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD 14, CD20, CDllb, CD16, CD45 and HLA-DR. [0151] Target antigens on cell surfaces for delivery include those characteristic of tumor antigens typically will be derived from the cell surface, cytoplasm, nucleus, organelles and the like of cells of tumor tissue. Examples of tumor targets for the antibody portion of the present invention include, without limitation, hematological cancers such as leukemias and lymphomas, neurological tumors such as astrocytomas or glioblastomas, melanoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, gastrointestinal tumors such as gastric or colon cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, genitourinary tumors such cervix, uterus, ovarian cancer, vaginal cancer, testicular cancer, prostate cancer or penile cancer, bone tumors, vascular tumors, or cancers of the lip, nasopharynx, pharynx and oral cavity, esophagus, rectum, gall bladder, biliary tree, larynx, lung and bronchus, bladder, kidney, brain and other parts of the nervous system, thyroid, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma and leukemia, [0152] Examples of antigens that may be delivered alone or in combination to immune cells for antigen presentation using the present invention includes tumor proteins, e.g., mutated oncogenes; viral proteins associated with tumors; and tumor mucins and glycolipids. The antigens may be viral proteins associated with tumors would be those from the classes of viruses noted above. Certain antigens may be characteristic of tumors (one subset being proteins not usually expressed by a tumor precursor cell), or may be a protein that is normally expressed in a tumor precursor cell, but having a mutation characteristic of a tumor. Other antigens include mutant variant(s) of the normal protein having an altered activity or subcellular distribution, e.g., mutations of genes giving rise to tumor antigens. [0153] Specific non-limiting examples of tumor antigens for use in an anti-CD40-fusion protein vaccine include, e.g., CEA, prostate specific antigen (PSA), HER-2/neu, BAGE, GAGE, MAGE 1-4, 6 and 12, MUC (Mucin) (e.g., MUC-1, MUC-2, etc.), GM2 and GD2 gangliosides, ras, myc, tyrosinase, MART (melanoma antigen), Pmel 17(gpl00), GnT-V intron V sequence (Νacetylglucoaminyltransferase V intron V sequence), Prostate Ca psm, PRAME (melanoma antigen), βcatenin, MUM-l-B (melanoma ubiquitous mutated gene product), GAGE (melanoma antigen) 1, MAGE, BAGE (melanoma antigen) 2-10, C-ERB2 (Her2/neu), DAGE, ΕΒΝΑ (Epstein-Barr Virus nuclear antigen) 1-6, gp75, human papilloma virus (HPV) Ε6 and Ε7, ρ53, lung resistance protein (LRP), Bcl-2, Ki-67, Cyclin Bl, gplOO, Survivin, andNYESO-1 [0154] In addition, the immunogenic molecule can be an autoantigen involved in the initiation and/or propagation of an autoimmune disease, the pathology of which is largely due to the activity of antibodies specific for a molecule expressed by the relevant target organ, tissue, or cells, e.g., SLE or MG. In such diseases, it can be desirable to direct an ongoing antibody-mediated (i.e., a Th2-type) immune response to the relevant autoantigen towards a cellular (i.e., a Thl-type) immune response. Alternatively, it can be desirable to prevent onset of or decrease the level of a Th2 response to the autoantigen in a subject not having, but who is suspected of being susceptible to, the relevant autoimmune disease by prophylactically inducing a Thl response to the appropriate autoantigen. Autoantigens of interest include, without limitation: (a) with respect to SLE, the Smith protein, RNP ribonucleoprotein, and the SS-A and SS-B proteins; and (b) with respect to MG, the acetylcholine receptor. Examples of other miscellaneous antigens involved in one or more types of autoimmune response include, e.g., endogenous hormones such as luteinizing hormone, follicular stimulating hormone, testosterone, growth hormone, prolactin, and other hormones. [0155] Antigens involved in autoimmune diseases, allergy, and graft rejection can be used in the compositions and methods of the invention. For example, an antigen involved in any one or more of the following autoimmune diseases or disorders can be used in the present invention: diabetes, diabetes mellitus, arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis), multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosis, autoimmune thyroiditis, dermatitis (including atopic dermatitis and eczematous dermatitis), psoriasis, Sjogren's Syndrome, including keratoconjunctivitis sicca secondary to Sjogren's Syndrome, alopecia areata, allergic responses due to arthropod bite reactions, Crohn's disease, aphthous ulcer, iritis, conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis, ulcerative colitis, asthma, allergic astlnna, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, vaginitis, proctitis, drug eruptions, leprosy reversal reactions, erythema nodosum leprosum, autoimmune uveitis, allergic encephalomyelitis, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, idiopathic bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing loss, aplastic anemia, pure red cell anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, polychondritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, chronic active hepatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, idiopathic sprue, lichen planus, Crohn's disease, Graves ophthalmopathy, sarcoidosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, uveitis posterior, and interstitial lung fibrosis. Examples of antigens involved in autoimmune disease include glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD 65), native DNA, myelin basic protein, myelin proteolipid protein, acetylcholine receptor components, thyroglobulin, and the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor. [0156] Examples of antigens involved in allergy include pollen antigens such as Japanese cedar pollen antigens, ragweed pollen antigens, rye grass pollen antigens, animal derived antigens such as dust mite antigens and feline antigens, histocompatiblity antigens, and penicillin and other therapeutic drugs. Examples of antigens involved in graft rejection include antigenic components of the graft to be transplanted into the graft recipient such as heart, lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, and neural graft components. The antigen may be an altered peptide ligand useful in treating an autoimmune disease. [0157] It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the sequence of any protein effector molecule may be altered in a manner that does not substantially affect the functional advantages of the effector protein. For example, glycine and alanine are typically considered to be interchangeable as are aspartic acid and glutamic acid and asparagine and glutamine. One of skill in the art will recognize that many different variations of effector sequences will encode effectors with roughly the same activity as the native effector. The effector molecule and the antibody may be conjugated by chemical or by recombinant means as described above. Chemical modifications include, for example, derivitization for the purpose of linking the effector molecule and the antibody to each other, either directly or through a linking compound, by methods that are well known in the art of protein chemistry. Both covalent and noncovalent attachment means may be used with the humanized antibodies of the present invention. [0158] The procedure for attaching an effector molecule to an antibody will vary according to the chemical structure of the moiety to be attached to the antibody. Polypeptides typically contain a variety of functional groups; e.g., carboxylic acid (COOH), free amine (--Ν¾) or sulfhydryl (-SH) groups, which are available for reaction with a suitable functional group on an antibody to result in the binding of the effector molecule. Alternatively, the antibody can be derivatized to expose or to attach additional reactive functional groups, e.g., by attachment of any of a number of linker molecules such as those available from Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford 111. [0159] The linker is capable of forming covalent bonds to both the antibody and to the effector molecule. Suitable linkers are well known to those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, straight or branched-chain carbon linkers, heterocyclic carbon linkers, or peptide linkers. Where the antibody and the effector molecule are polypeptides, the linkers may be joined to the constituent amino acids through their side groups (e.g., through a disulfide linkage to cysteine). However, in a preferred embodiment, the linkers will be joined to the alpha carbon amino and carboxyl groups of the terminal amino acids. [0160] In some circumstances, it is desirable to free the effector molecule from the antibody when the immunoconjugate has reached its target site. Therefore, in these circumstances, immunoconjugates will comprise linkages that are cleavable in the vicinity of the target site. Cleavage of the linker to release the effector molecule from the antibody may be prompted by enzymatic activity or conditions to which the immunoconjugate is subjected either inside the target cell or in the vicinity of the target site. When the target site is a tumor, a linker that is cleavable under conditions present at the tumor site (e.g. when exposed to tumor-associated enzymes or acidic pH) may be used. [0161] Exemplary chemical modifications of the effector molecule and the antibody of the present invention also include derivitization with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to extend time of residence in the circulatory system and reduce immunogenicity, according to well known methods (See for example, Lisi, et al., Applied Biochem. 4:19 (1982); Beauchamp, et al., Anal Biochem. 131:25 (1982); and Goodson, et al., Bio/Technology 8:343 (1990)). [0162] The present invention contemplates vaccines for use in both active and passive immunization embodiments. Immunogenic compositions, proposed to be suitable for use as a vaccine, may be prepared most readily directly from immunogenic T-cell stimulating peptides prepared in a manner disclosed herein. The final vaccination material is dialyzed extensively to remove undesired small molecular weight molecules and/or lyophilized for more ready formulation into a desired vehicle. In certain embodiment of the present invention, the compositions and methods of the present invention are used to manufacture a cellular vaccine, e.g., the antigen-delivering anti-CD40 binding portion of the antibody is used to direct the antigen(s) to an antigen presenting cell, which then “loads” the antigen onto MHC proteins for presentation. The cellular vaccine is, therefore, the antigen presenting cell that has been loaded using the compositions of the present invention to generate antigen-loaded antigen presenting cells. [0163] When the vaccine is the anti-CD40 binding protein itself, e.g., a complete antibody or fragments thereof, then these “active ingredients” can be made into vaccines using methods understood in the art, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,608,251; 4,601,903; 4,599,231; 4,599,230; and 4.578,770, relevant portions incorporated herein by reference. Typically, such vaccines are prepared as injectables, e.g., as liquid solutions or suspensions or solid forms suitable for re-suspension in liquid prior to injection. The preparation may also be emulsified. The active immunogenic ingredient is often mixed with excipients that are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, or the like and combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the vaccine may contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, or adjuvants that enhance the effectiveness of the vaccines. [0164] The vaccines are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation, and in such amount as will be therapeutically effective and immunogenic. The quantity to be administered depends on the subject to be treated, including, e.g., the capacity of the individual's immune system to generate an immune response. Precise amounts of cells or active ingredient required to be administered depend on the judgment of the practitioner. However, suitable dosage ranges are of the order of a few thousand cells (to millions of cells) for cellular vaccines. For standard epitope or epitope delivery vaccines then the vaccine may be several hundred micrograms active ingredient per vaccination. Suitable regimes for initial administration and booster shots are also variable, but are typified by an initial administration followed by subsequent inoculations or other administrations. [0165] The manner of application may vary widely, however, certain embodiments herein will most lilcely be delivered intravenously or at the site of a tumor or infection directly. Regardless, any of the conventional methods for administration of a vaccine are applicable. The dosage of the vaccine will depend on the route of administration and will vary according to the size of the host. [0166] In many instances, it will be desirable to have multiple administrations of the vaccine, e.g., four to six vaccinations provided weekly or eveiy other week. A normal vaccination regimen will often occur in two to twelve week intervals or from three to six week intervals. Periodic boosters at intervals of 1-5 years, usually three years, may be desirable to maintain protective levels of the immune response or upon a likelihood of a remission or re-infection. The course of the immunization may be followed by assays for, e.g., Τ cell activation, cytokine secretion or even antibody production, most commonly conducted in vitro. These immune response assays are well known and may be found in a wide variety of patents and as taught herein. [0167] The vaccine of the present invention may be provided in one or more “unit doses” depending on whether the nucleic acid vectors are used, the final purified proteins, or the final vaccine form is used. Unit dose is defined as containing a predetermined-quantity of the therapeutic composition calculated to produce the desired responses in association with its administration, i.e., the appropriate route and treatment regimen. The quantity to be administered, and the particular route and formulation, are within the skill of those in the clinical arts. The subject to be treated may also be evaluated, in particular, the state of the subject’s immune system and the protection desired. A unit dose need not be administered as a single injection but may include continuous infusion over a set period of time. Unit dose of the present invention may conveniently be described in terms of DNA/kg (or protein/Kg) body weight, with ranges between about 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 10, 50, 100, 1,000 or more mg/DNA or protein/kg body weight are administered. [0168] Likewise, the amount of anti-CD40-antigen vaccine delivered can vary from about 0.2 to about 8.0 mg/lcg body weight. Thus, in particular embodiments, 0.4 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.8 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg, 2.5 mg, 3.0 mg, 4.0 mg, 5.0 mg, 5.5 mg, 6.0 mg, 6.5 mg, 7.0 mg and 7.5 mg of the vaccine may be delivered to an individual in vivo. The dosage of vaccine to be administered depends to a great extent on the weight and physical condition of the subject being treated as well as the route of administration and the frequency of treatment. A pharmaceutical composition that includes a naked polynucleotide prebound to a liposomal or viral delivery vector may be administered in amounts ranging from 1 pg to 1 mg polynucleotide to 1 pg to 100 mg protein. Thus, particular compositions may include between about 1 pg, 5 pg, 10 pg, 20 pg, 30 pg, 40 pg, 50 pg, 60 pg, 70 pg, 80 pg, 100 pg, 150 pg, 200 pg, 250 pg, 500 pg, 600 pg, 700 pg, 800 pg, 900 pg or 1,000 pg polynucleotide or protein that is bound independently to 1 pg, 5 pg, 10 pg, 20 pg, 3.0 pg, 40 pg 50 pg, 60 pg, 70 pg, 80 pg, 100 pg, 150 pg, 200 pg, 250 pg, 500 pg, 600 pg, 700 pg, 800 pg, 900 pg, 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg, 70 mg, 80 mg, 90 mg or 100 mg vector. [0169] Antibodies of the present invention may optionally be covalently or non-covalently linked to a detectable label. Detectable labels suitable for such use include any composition detectable by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, electrical, optical or chemical methods. Useful labels in the present invention include magnetic beads (e.g., DYNABEADS®), fluorescent dyes (e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate, Texas red, rhodamine, green fluorescent protein, and the like), radiolabels (e.g., 3H, 1251, 35S, 14C, or 32P), enzymes (e.g., horse radish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase and others commonly used in an ELISA), and colorimetric labels such as colloidal gold or colored glass or plastic (e.g. polystyrene, polypropylene, latex, etc.) beads. [0170] Methods of detecting such labels are well known to those of skill in the art. Thus, for example, radiolabels may be detected using photographic film or scintillation counters, fluorescent markers may be detected using a photodetector to detect emitted illumination. Enzymatic labels are typically detected by providing the enzyme with a substrate and detecting the reaction product produced by the action of the enzyme on the substrate, and colorimetric labels are detected by simply visualizing the colored label. [0171] The antibody and/or immunoconjugate compositions of this invention are particularly useful for parenteral administration, such as intravenous administration or administration into a body cavity. The compositions for administration will commonly comprise a solution of the antibody and/or immunoconjugate dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, preferably an aqueous carrier. A variety of aqueous carriers can be used, e.g., buffered saline and the like. These solutions are sterile and generally free of undesirable matter. These compositions may be sterilized by conventional, well-known sterilization techniques. The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, toxicity adjusting agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium lactate and the like. The concentration of fusion protein in these formulations can vary widely, and will be selected primarily based on fluid volumes, viscosities, body weight and the like in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected and the patient's needs. [0172] Thus, a typical pharmaceutical immunoconjugate composition of the present invention for intravenous administration would be about 0.1 to 10 mg per patient per day. Dosages from 0.1 up to about 100 mg per patient per day may be used. Actual methods for preparing administrable compositions will be known or apparent to those skilled in the art and are described in more detail in such publications as REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE, 19th Ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1995). [0173] The compositions of the present invention can be administered for therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a patient suffering from a disease, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as a “therapeutically effective dose.” Amounts effective for this use will depend upon the severity of the disease and the general state of the patient's health. An effective amount of the compound is that which provides either subjective relief of a symptom(s) or an objectively identifiable improvement as noted by the clinician or other qualified observer. [0174] Single or multiple administrations of the compositions are administered depending on the dosage and frequency as required and tolerated by the patient. In any event, the composition should provide a sufficient quantity of the proteins of this invention to effectively treat the patient. Preferably, the dosage is administered once but may be applied periodically until either a therapeutic result is achieved or until side effects warrant discontinuation of therapy. Generally, the dose is sufficient to treat or ameliorate symptoms or signs of disease without producing unacceptable toxicity to the patient. [0175] Controlled release parenteral formulations of the immunoconjugate compositions of the present invention can be made as implants, oily injections, or as particulate systems. For a broad overview of protein delivery systems see, Banga, A. J., Therapeutic Peptides And Proteins: Formulation, PROCESSING, And DELIVERY SYSTEMS, Technomic Publishing Company, Inc., Lancaster, Pa., (1995) incorporated herein by reference. Particulate systems include microspheres, microparticles, microcapsules, nanocapsules, nanospheres, and nanoparticles. Microcapsules contain the therapeutic protein as a central core. In microspheres the therapeutic is dispersed throughout the particle. Particles, microspheres, and microcapsules smaller than about 1 pm are generally referred to as nanoparticles, nanospheres, and nanocapsules, respectively. Capillaries have a diameter of approximately 5 pm so that only nanoparticles are administered intravenously. Microparticles are typically around 100 pm in diameter and are administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. [0176] Polymers can be used for ion-controlled release of immunoconjugate compositions of the present invention. Various degradable and non-degradable polymeric matrices for use in controlled drug delivery are known in the art (Langer, R., Accounts Chem. Res. 26:537-542 (1993)). For example, the block copolymer, poloxamer 407® exists as a viscous yet mobile liquid at low temperatures but forms a semisolid gel at body temperature, hydroxyapatite has been used as a microcarrier for controlled release of proteins, and/or liposomes may be used for controlled release as well as drug targeting of the lipidcapsulated drug. Numerous additional systems for controlled delivery of therapeutic proteins are known. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,055,303, 5,188,837, 4,235,871, 4,501,728, 4,837,028 4,957,735 and 5,019,369, 5,055,303; 5,514,670; 5,413,797; 5,268,164; 5,004,697; 4,902,505; 5,506,206, 5,271,961; 5,254,342 and 5,534,496, relevant portions of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. [0177] Among various uses of the immunoconjugates of the invention are included a variety of disease conditions caused by specific human cells that may be eliminated by the toxic action of the fusion protein. For example, for the humanized anti-CD40_12E12.3F3 (ATCC Accession No. PTA-9854), anti-CD40_12B4.2C 10 (ATCC Accession No. , Submission No. AB13-22.12B4.2C10 (HS446)), and anti-CD40_llB6.1C3 (ATCC Accession No. , Submission No. AB13-22.11B6.1C3 (HS440)), antibodies disclosed herein, one preferred application for immunoconjugates is the treatment of malignant cells expressing CD40. [0178] In another embodiment, this invention provides kits for the delivery of antigens, e.g., CD40 or an immunoreactive fragment thereof, conjugated or in the form of a fusion protein with one or more Τ cell or Β cell epitopes. A “biological sample” as used herein is a sample of biological tissue or fluid that contains the antigen. Such samples include, but are not limited to, tissue from biopsy, blood, and blood cells (e.g., white cells). Preferably, the cells are lymphocytes, e.g., dendritic cells. Biological samples also include sections of tissues, such as frozen sections taken for histological purposes. A biological sample is typically obtained from a multicellular eukaryote, preferably a mammal such as rat, mouse, cow, dog, guinea pig, or rabbit, and more preferably a primate, such as a macaque, chimpanzee, or human. Most preferably, the sample is from a human. The antibodies of the invention may also be used in vivo, for example, as a diagnostic tool for in vivo imaging. [0179] Kits will typically comprise a nucleic acid sequence that encodes an antibody of the present invention (or fragment thereof) with one or more framework portions or multiple cloning sites at the carboxy-terminal end into which the coding sequences for one or more antigens may be inserted. In some embodiments, the antibody will be a humanized anti-CD40 Fv fragment, such as an scFv or dsFv fragment. In addition the kits will typically include instructional materials disclosing methods of use of an antibody of the present invention (e.g. for loading into dendritic cells prior to immunization with the dendritic cells, which can be autologous dendritic cells). The kits may also include additional components to facilitate the particular application for which the kit is designed. Thus, for example, the kit may additionally contain methods of detecting the label (e.g. enzyme substrates for enzymatic labels, filter sets to detect fluorescent labels, appropriate secondary labels such as a sheep anti-mouse-HRP, or the like). The kits may additionally include buffers and other reagents routinely used for the practice of a particular method. Such kits and appropriate contents are well known to those of skill in the art. [0180] In another set of uses for the invention, immunoconjugates targeted by antibodies of the invention can be used to purge targeted cells from a population of cells in a culture. For example, if a specific population of Τ cells is preferred, the immunoconjugates of the present invention may be used to enrich a population of Τ cells having the opposite effect of the on-going immune response. Thus, for example, cells cultured from a patient having a cancer can be purged of cancer cells by providing the patient with dendritic cells that were antigen loaded using the antibodies of the invention as a targeting moiety for the antigens that will trigger an immune response against the cancer, virus or other pathogen. Likewise, the immunoconjugates can be used to increase the population of regulatory Τ cells or drive the immune response toward or away from a cytotoxic Τ cell response or even drive a Β cell response. [0181] Example 1: Anti-CD40 - HIV peptides vaccine [0182] Five 19- to 32-amino-acid long sequences were selected from a multiplicity of cytotoxic Τ lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes identified in the HIV-1 Nef, Gag and Εην proteins in the context of different MHC-class I molecules. It has been reported that CTL responses can be induced efficiently by lipopeptide vaccines in mice, in primates, and in humans. The five HIV peptides were then modified in C-terminal position by a (Palm)-NH2 group and the five HIV peptide sequences have been well described in the scientific literature [e.g., Characterization of a multi-lipopeptides mixture used as an HIV-1 vaccine candidate (1999) Klinguer et al., Vaccine, Volume 18, 259-267] and in a patent application [Cytotoxic Τ lymphocyte-inducing lipopeptides and use as vaccines. Gras-Masse Η. et al., Patent No. ΕΡ0491628 (1992-06-24); US 5871746 (1999-02-16)]. [0183] A very desirable HIV vaccine would be composed of recombinant anti-dendritic cell receptor antibody fused to the above HIV peptides. The present invention includes compositions and methods to efficiently produce proteins and HIV vaccines.

Expression vectors for the Η chains fused to various C-terminal HIV peptides coding regions were co-transfected with the matching light chain (L) plasmid into transient 293F cells for three days before harvesting the supernatant for subsequent purification. Cell number and DNA amount were constant between transfections. Since the protein A affinity matrix was used in excess, the SDS.PAGE analysis defines both the production yield and the Η chain integrity of the various vaccine constructs. Lanes 1, 4 and 5 (upper bands) show that the Η chains fused directly to HIV gagl7, nef66 and poll58 peptides can be well-secreted. Lane 2 shows that the Η chain fused directly to HIV gag253 peptide expresses poorly. Lane 3 shows that the Η chain fused directly to HIV η℮Η16 peptide is not expressed at all. [0196] Surprisingly, it was found that the use of flexible potentially glycosylated inter-peptide coding region linker sequences improves the secretion of intact recombinant antibody-HIV peptides fusion proteins. [0197] The flexible linker sequences used are derived from cellulosomal anchoring scaffoldin Β precursor [Bacteroides cellulosolvens] and have been described by the present inventors in co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 61/081,234, relevant portions incorporated herein by reference.

[0202] Figure 2 shows protein A affinity purified recombinant antibodies fused to various HIV peptides (Lanes 1 and 2) secreted from transfected 293F cells, then analyzed by reducing SDS.PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Expression vectors for the Η chains fused to various C-terminal HIV peptides coding regions were co-transfected with the matching L chain plasmid into transient 293F cells for three days before harvesting the supernatant for subsequent purification. Lanes 1 and 2 (upper bands) show that the Η chains fused directly to a HIV peptide string of gagl7-nef66-nefll6 can be well-secreted. Also the Η chain product containing a HIV peptide string of gag 17 and η℮∩16 separated by the flexible spacer fl (Lane 2) is also well expressed. Thus HIV nefl 16 peptide, which is not expressed as a secreted product when directly fused to the Η chain alone, can be well-expressed when appended in certain other peptide and flexible string contexts. Note that the Η chain fused directly to gagl7-flη℮Π16 [82 residues] migrates slower than Η chain with gagl7-nef66-nefll6 [89 residues] this suggests that the flexible linker fl is glycosylated, possibly also enhancing the production of the secreted gagl7-fl-nefl 16 fusion antibody versus gagl7-nef66-nefl 16 fusion antibody.

Expression vectors for the Η chains fused to various C-terminal HIV peptides coding regions were co-transfected with the matching L chain plasmid into transient 293F cells for three days before harvesting the supernatant for subsequent purification. Lanes 1, 2 and 3 (upper bands) show that the 4 HIV peptides-flexible spacers fused to Η chain via the flexible linker flex-vl can be well-secreted. However, a string of 4 HIV peptides fused directly to Η chain is not expressed at all (Lane 4, upper band). Also, lane 5 (upper band) shows that a string of 5 HIV peptides fused directly to Η chain is not expressed at all.

Expression vectors for the Η chains fused to various C-terminal HIV peptides coding regions were co-transfected with the matching L chain plasmid into transient 293F cells for three days before harvesting the supernatant for subsequent purification. Lanes 1, 3 and 5 (upper bands) show that the string of 4 HIV peptides-flexible spacers fused to Η chain via the flexible linker flex-vl can be well-secreted. Lanes 2 and 6 (upper bands) show that the string of 5 HIV peptides-flexible spacers fused to Η chain via the flexible linker flex-vl expresses poorly. However certain combinations and contexts of HIV peptide coding sequences enhance secretion of recombinant antibody-HIV peptide fusion proteins (Lanes 3 and 4). Thus Η chain fused to a string of 5 HIV peptides-flexible spacers via the flexible linker flex-vl can be well-expressed when appended in certain other peptide and flexible string contexts (Lane 4). [0208] The present invention includes compositions and methods for flexible potentially glycosylated inter-peptide coding region linker sequences and combinations of such HIV peptide coding regions that are particularly favorable to efficient secretion of recombinant anti-DC receptor antibody-HIV peptide fusion vaccines. [0209] The use of inter-structural domain linker sequences derived from cellulose-degrading bacteria as preferred inter-domain linker sequences in protein engineering - particularly those with highly predicted glycosylation sites. Desirable properties of these sequences are i) inherent flexibility, thereby facilitating separation of linked domains which should greatly help their correct folding and maintaining Β cell receptor access to conformationally-dependent antigen epitopes; ii) glycosylation, thereby helping secretion and solubility of the intact produced fusion protein, and also protecting of the linker sequences from culture medium proteases. [0210] Certain combinations of HIV peptide coding regions favor secretion and that particular flexible linker sequences inserted between the HIV peptide coding sequences can also help secretion of intact HIV peptide string vaccines - principles that can also be applied to solve similar issues for other preferred peptide antigens.

The Η chain expression vectors typically have a Nhe I site [g|ctagc] appended to the Η chain C-terminal residue codon, or [for flex- vl vectors] to the C-terminal codon of the flex-vl sequence. Flexible linker sequences or HIV peptide sequences have an Spe I site [a|ctagt] preceding the N-terminal flexible linker or HIV peptide codon, a Nhe I site appended to the C-terminal flexible linker or HIV peptide codon, followed by a TGA stop codon, followed by a Eco RI site, followed by a Not I site. Such flexible linker or HIV peptide Spe I - Not I fragments are inserted into the Η chain vector prepared with Nhe I - Not I digestion. Nhe I and Spe I are compatible sites, but when ligated [g|ctagt] is no longer either a Nhe I or Spe I site. Thus additional Spe I - Not I flexible linker or HIV peptide fragments can be inserted into the new Nhe I - Not I interval distal to the initial flexible linker or HIV peptide. In this way, strings of HIV peptide and/or flexible linker coding regions can be appended to the expression vector Η chain coding region. [0214] Example 2. HIV peptides vaccine - in vitro antigen-targeting biology [0215] Anti-CD40.LIPO5 HIV peptides vaccine tests on HIV patients in vitro. To study the ability of aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide fusion recombinant antibody (aCD40.LIPO5 rAb) to mediate antigen presentation, the fusion rAb was added to blood cells from HIV-infected individuals and measured cytokine production form peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). [0216] Figure 5 describes the protocol used in vitro to assay the potency of aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide fusion recombinant antibody (aCD40.LIPO5 rAb) to elicit the expansion of antigen-specific Τ cells in the context of a PBMC culture. Briefly, PBMCs (2x106 cells/ml) from apheresis of HIV patients are incubated with a dose range of aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine. On day 2, 100 U/ml IL-2 are added to the culture and then, the media is refreshed every 2 days with 100 U/ml IL-2. On day 10, the expanded cells are challenged for 48 h with the individual long peptides corresponding to the 5 HIV peptide sequences incorporated in the aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide fusion rAb. Then, culture supernatants are harvested and assessed for cytokine production (by the Τ cells with Τ cell receptor [TCR] specificities for peptide sequences) using multiplex beads assay (Luminex). Antigen-specific cytokine production detected in such an assay, if it depends on the presence of the anti-CD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine, reflects vaccine uptake by antigen presenting cells [APC] in the culture, and processing [proteolytic degradation] and presentation of peptides on MHC. The antigen-MHC complexes are recognized by Τ cells with TCR that recognize only the particular HIV antigen-MHC complex. In a HIV patient, such cells are likely to be memoiy Τ cells that expanded in the patient in response to the HIV infection. [0217] Epitopes from all 5 HIV peptide regions of the vaccine can be presented by APCs. The scheme in Figure 5 was used to assay the in vitro expansion of HIV peptide-specific Τ cells in response to anti-CD40.LIPO5 peptide vaccine. Results from 7 individuals are shown in Figure 6 and indicate that the aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide fusion rAb elicited HIV peptide-specific IFNy responses in all of the patients studied. Thus, the a-CD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide fusion rAb allows DCs to cross-present at least 1 or 2 different peptides out of the 5 peptides within the vaccine to the Τ cells of each individual. However, the set of HIV peptides that stimulated IFNy production was different for each patient - most likely reflecting different pools of memory Τ cells for HIV specificity. [0218] Figure 6A-C shows the HIV peptide-specific IFNy production in PBMCs from HIV patients incubated with various concentrations of anti-CD40.LIPO5 peptide string vaccine. C is the control group, which received no vaccine, and defines the baseline response of the culture to each peptide. [0219] Figure 7 is a summary of aCD40.LIPO5 peptide vaccine responses against the 5 peptide regions from 8 HIV patients. The data are based on peptide-specific IFNy production. Figure 7 shows that the antigen-specific responses observed in 8 HIV patients. The data demonstrate that all HIV peptide regions on the vaccine have the capacity to be processed and presented to Τ cells - assuming the likely situation that responses to these peptides will only be observed if the appropriate TCR-bearing cells are present. Thus, each patient has a characteristic spectrum of such cells. [0220] The aCD40.LIPO5 peptide vaccine can evoke the proliferation of antigen-specific Τ cells capable of secreting a wide spectrum of cytokines [0221] Figure 8A-C shows that aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine elicits expansion of HIV peptide-specific Τ cells capable of secreting multiple cytokines - a desirable feature in a vaccine. In Figure 8Α-C aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine elicits gag253, nef66, η℮Ω16 and ρο1325 peptide-specific responses characterized by production of multiple cytokines. This is patient Α5. [0222] Anti-CD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccination of ex vivo DCs. [0223] Figure 9 shows the protocol for testing aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine for its ability to direct the expansion of antigen-specific Τ cells resulting from targeted uptake by DCs and presentation of peptide epitopes on their surface MHC complex. Briefly, HIV patient monocytes are differentiated into DCs by culture for 2 days with IFNa and GM-CSF. Different doses aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine or a mix of the 5 peptides are then added for 18 h. Autologous Τ cells were added to the co-culture (at a ratio of 1:20) on day 3. On day 5, 100 U/ml IL-2 are added to the culture and then, the media is refreshed every 2 days with 100 U/ml IL-2. On day 10, the expanded cells are rechallenged for 48 h with the individual long peptides corresponding to the 5 HIV peptide sequences incorporated in the aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide fusion rAb. Then, culture supernatants are harvested and assessed for cytokine production using Luminex. [0224] Figure 10Α-Β shows the cytokine secretion in response to HIV peptides from DC-T cell cocultures treated with various doses of aCD40.LIP05 HIV peptide vaccine. This is patient A10. The results in the patient Α10 shown in Figure 10Α-Β demonstrate expansion of antigen-specific Τ cells corresponding to epitopes within the gagl7, gag253, and ρο1325 HIV peptide regions. In most instances, there is concordance of responses between aCD40.LlPO5 HIV peptide vaccine and non-LlP05 vaccine [mixture of 5 non-lipidated HIV peptides with sequences corresponding to those in the aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine]. Thus, the aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine functions well in this in vitro setting where cultured DCs effectively process and present the HIV antigens to Τ cells. This exemplifies use of the aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine for ex vivo vaccination, whereby the ‘vaccinated DCs’ would be cryopreserved for future re-injection into the same patient. [0225] aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine - possible immune effect of the flexible linker regions. It is possible that the flexible linker sequences interspersing the HIV peptide sequences within the aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine themselves contain Τ cell epitopes. Figure 11Α-Β shows that patient Α4 does not appear to have a significant pool of memory Τ cells with specificities to the five flexible linker sequences within aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine. In Figure 11Α-Β, PBMCs from patient Α4 treated with the aCD40.L!PO5 HIV peptide vaccine elicit expansion of antigen-specific Τ cells with specificity to the gag253 region, but not to the flexible linker sequences. The protocol describe in Figure 9 was used, with the flexible linker long peptides corresponding in sequence to the bold areas, the HIV peptides are in bold-italics, shown in the sequence below.

(SEQ ID ΝΟ.:36). [0227] In Figure 12Α, the PBMCs from patient A3 treated with the aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine elicit expansion of antigen-specific Τ cells with specificities to the gag253, nef66, and η℮Π16 regions, but not to the flexible linker sequences. The protocol described in Figure 1 was used, with the flexible linker long peptides corresponding in sequence to the bold areas shown in Figure 8. [0228] Figure 12Β-1 and B-2 shows HIV antigen-specific Τ cell responses evoked from HIV patient Α17 PBMCs incubated with 30 ηΜ of three different HIV5 peptide DC targeting vaccines. Cells were cultured for 10 days with IL-2 and then stimulated with individual long peptides corresponding to the 5 HIV peptide sequences encompassed within the DC-targeting vaccines. After 1 hr brefeldin A was added and incubation continued for a further 5 hrs before staining for FACS analysis. The FACS plots show IFNy and CD8 staining on CD3+ Τ cells. Circles indicate significant vaccine-evoked expansion of IFNy+ cells compared to cells from PBMCs cultured without vaccine. CD8- cells are CD4+ Τ cells. The data show that that anti-CD40.HIV5pep vaccine evokes a strong expansion of nef66 (N66)-specific CD8+ Τ cells which is not seen with the other DC targeting vehicles. [0229] These are data based on the LIP05 HIV peptide string. For example the anti-CD40 Η chain is anti-CD40_ 12Ε12.3F3_H-LV-hIgG4H-C-Flex-v 1 -Pep-gag 17-fl -gag253-f2-nefl 16-0 -nef66-f4-pol 158] with sequence: EVKLVESGGGLVQPGGSLKLSCATSGFTFSDYYMYWVRQTPEKRLEWVAYrNSGGGSTYYPD TVKGRFTISRDNAKNTLYLQMSRLKSEDTAMYYCARRGLPFHAMDYWGQGTSVTVSSAKTKG PSVFPLAPCSRSTSESTAALGCLVKDYFPEPVTVSWNSGALTSGVHTFPAVLQSSGLYSLSSVVT VPSSSLGTKTYTCNVDHKPSNTKVDKRVESKYGPPCPPCPAPEFEGGPSVFLFPPKPKDTLMISR TPEVTCVWDVSQEDPEVQFNWYVDGVEVHNAKTKPREEQFNSTYRVVSVLTVLHQDWLNG KEYKCKVSNKGLPSSIEKTISKAKGQPREPQVYTLPPSQEEMTKNQVSLTCLVKGFYPSDIAVE WESNGQPENNYKTTPPVLDSDGSFFLYSRLTVDKSRWQEGNVFSCSVMHEALHNHYTQKSLSL SLGKASQTPTNTISVTPTNNSTPTNNSNPKPNPASEKIRLRPGGKKKYKLKHIVASSSVSPTTSVH PTPTSVPPTPTKSSPASNPPIPVGEIYKRWI1LGLNKIVRMYSPTSILDASPTSTPADSSTITPTATPT ATPTIKGASHTQGYFPDWQNYTPGPGVRYPLTFGWLYKLASTVTPTATATPSA1VTTITPTATTK PASVGFPVTPQVPLRPMTYKAAVDLSHFLKEKGGLASTNGS1TVAATAPTVTPTVNATPSAAAS AIFQSSMTKILEPFRKQNPDIVIYQYMDDLYAS (SEQ ID NO.: 37). [0230] Figure 12C-1 and C-2 is a similar study to that show in Figure 12Β, except that the PBMCs are from a different HIV patient (Α2). The data show antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ Τ cell responses evoked by anti-CD40.HIV5pep but not the other DC-targeting vaccines, or by a mixture of the peptides themselves. [0231] Figure 12D shows that, based on analysis of 15 different HIV peptide responses [5 peptide regions sampled in 3 patients), anti-CD40.HIV5pep vaccine is clearly superior to anti-DCIR.HIV5pep, anti-LOX-1 .HIV5pep and ηοη-ΠΡ05 mix for eliciting a broad range of HIV peptide-specific CD8+ and CD4+ Τ responses. [0232] The immunogenicity of the flexible linker sequences is of concern for the aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine design. The limited datasets shown above, testing recall of Τ cells with specificities for epitopes within the flexible linker sequences, suggest that the human repertoire against these sequences is variable. Also, the ability of these sequences to prime responses de novo is untested. Responses to the aCD40.LIPO5 HIV peptide vaccine in monkeys can be tested using the present invention. If necessary, certain less desirable epitopes within these regions can be identified by a combination of predictive computational means and peptide stimulation scans, and then eliminated by introducing mutational changes that abrogate the TCR interaction.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Cycline Dl, MART-1, influenza viral nucleoprotein (ΝΡ) and ΗΑ1 subunit of influenza viral hemagglutinin (Η1Ν1, PR8) and peptide screen. [0243] Internalization of anti-CD40 mAb. 1χ106 IL-4DCs were incubated for 1 h in ice with 3 mg/ml human gamma globulin in PBS containing 3% BSA to block non-specific binding. Cells were pulsed for 30 minutes on ice with Alexa 568 labeled anti-CD40 mAb (all at 20 ng/ml final concentration in non-specific block). Cells were then washed and allowed to internalize surface bound antibodies for different times, between 0 and 90 minutes, at 37°C. Following internalization, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% sodium azide (ΡΒΑ) and fixed in ice-cold 1% methanol-free formaldehyde (MFF) in PBS overnight at 4°C. Cells were permeablized in PBS 3% BSA containing 0.5% saponin (PBAS) for 20 minutes at 4°C, and transferred to a 96-well round bottom polypropylene microtiter plate. After washing twice with ice-cold PBAS, cells were incubated for 1 h on ice with 3 mg/ml human gamma globulin in PBAS. BODIPY-phalloidin diluted in PBAS and incubated with cells for 1 hour in ice. Cells were further stained with TOPRO-II, as a nuclear counterstain. Slides were imaged on a Leica SP1 confocal microscope. [0244] Cells. Monoclonal antibodies for cell surface staining were purchased from BD Biosciences (CA). Monocytes (lxl06/ml) from healthy donors were cultured in Cellgenics media (France) containing GM-CSF (100 ng/ml) and IL-4 (50 ng/ml) or GM-CSF (100 ng/ml) and IFNa (500 Units/ml) (R&D, CA). For IFNDCs, cells were fed on day 1 with IFNa and GM-CSF. For IL-4DCs, the same amounts of cytokines were supplemented into the media on day one and day three. PBMCs were isolated from Buffy coats using Percoll™ gradients (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) by density gradient centrifugation. Total CD4+ and CD8+ Τ cells were purified by using StemCell kits (CA). [0245] Peptides. 15-mers (11 amino acid overlapping) for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Cycline Dl, MART-1, influenza viral nucleoprotein (ΝΡ) and ΗΑ1 subunit of influenza viral hemagglutinin (Η1Ν1, PR8), were synthesized (Mimotopes). [0246] DCs and Τ cell co-culture and cytokine expressions. 5χ103 DCs loaded with recombinant fusion proteins (anti-CD40-HAl, Control Ig-HAl, anti-CD40-PSA, anti-CD40-Cyclin Dl, anti-CD40-MART-1, anti-MARCO-MART-1, and control Ig-MART-1) were co-cultured with 2χ105 CFSE-labeled CD4+ Τ cells for 8 days. Proliferation was tested by measuring CFSE dilution after staining cells with anti-CD4 antibody labeled with APC. [0247] For measuring the expression of intracellular IFNy, CD4+ Τ cells were restimulated with 1-5 uM of indicated peptides for 5h in the presence of Brefeldin A. In separate experiments, CD4+ Τ cells were restimulated with peptides indicated for 36h, and then cytokines secreted by CD4+ Τ cells were measured by the Luminex. [0248] CD8+ Τ cells were co-cultured with DCs for 10 days in the presence of 20 units/ml IL-2 and 20 units/ml IL-7. On day 10 of the culture, CD8+ Τ cells were stained with anti-CD8 and tetramers indicated. [0249] CTL assay. On day 10 of the culture, a 5-h 51Cr release assay was performed. Τ2 cells pulsed with 51Cr first and then labeled with 10 uM HLA-A2 epitope of MART-1 or 1 ηΜ epitope of influenza viral Ml. Τ2 cells without peptide were used as control. The mean of triplicate samples was calculated, and the percentage of specific lysis was determined using the following formula: percentage of specific lysis = 100 χ (experimental 51Cr release - control 51Cr release)/(maximum 51Cr release - control 51Cr release). The maximum release refers to counts from targets in 2.5% Triton Χ-100. [0250] Preparation of mAbs specific for human CD40. Receptor ectodomain.hlgG (human IgGIFc) and ΑΡ (human placental alkaline phosphatase) fusion proteins were produced for immunizing mice and screening mAbs, respectively. A mammalian vector for human IgFc fusion proteins was engineered as described [J. Immunol 163: 1973-1983 (1999)]. The mammalian expression vector for receptor ectodomain.AP proteins was generated using PCR to amplify cDNA for ΑΡ resides 133-1581 (gb|BC009647|) while adding a proximal in-frame Xho I site and a distal 6C-terminal His residues followed by a TGA stop codon and Not I site. This Xho I - Not I fragment replaced the human IgG Fc coding sequence in the above ectodomain.IgG vector. Fusion proteins were produced using the FreeStyle™ 293 Expression System (Invitrogen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (1 mg total plasmid DNA with 1.3 ml 293Fectin reagent /L of transfection). Receptor ectodomain.hlgG was purified by 1 ml HiTrap protein A affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, CA) eluted with 0.1 Μ glycine, pH 2.7. Fractions were neutralized with 2Μ Tris, and then dialyzed against PBS. [0251] Mouse mAbs were generated by conventional technology. Briefly, six-week-old BALB/c mice were immunized i.p. with 20 pg of receptor ectodomain.hlgGFc fusion protein with Ribi adjuvant, then boosted with 20 pg antigen ten days and fifteen days later. After three months, the mice were boosted again three days prior to taking the spleens. Three to four days after a final boosting, draining lymph nodes (LN) were harvested. Β cells from spleen or LN cells were fused with SP2/0-Ag 14 cells (ATCC). Hybridoma supernatants were screened to analyze mAbs specific to the receptor ectodomain fusion protein compared to the fusion partner alone, or to the receptor ectodomain fused to alkaline phosphatase [J. Immunol. 163: 1973-1983 (1999)]. Positive wells were then screened in FACS using 293F cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding full-length receptor cDNAs. Selected hybridomas were single cell cloned and expanded in CELLine flasks (Integra, CA). Hybridoma supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of 1.5 Μ glycine, 3 Μ NaCl, lx PBS, pH 7.8 (binding buffer) and tumbled with MabSelect resin (GE Healthcare, CA) (800 pi /5ml supernatant). The resin was washed with binding buffer and eluted with 0.1 Μ glycine, pH 2.7. Following neutralization with 2 Μ Tris, mAbs were dialyzed against PBS. [0252] Expression and purification of recombinant mAbs. Total RNA was prepared from hybridoma cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, CA) and used for cDNA synthesis and PCR (SMART RACE kit, BD Biosciences) using supplied 5’ primers and gene specific 3’ primers (mlgGK, 5’ggatggtgggaagatggatacagttggtgcagcatc3’ (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:48); mIgG2a, 5’ccaggcatcctagagtcaccgaggagccagt3’) (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:49). PCR products were then cloned (pCR2.1 ΤΑ kit, Invitrogen) and characterized by DNA sequencing (MC Lab, CA). Using the derived sequences for the mouse heavy (Η) and light (L) chain variable (V)-region cDNAs, specific primers were used to PCR amplify the signal peptide and V-regions while incorporating flanking restriction sites for cloning into expression vectors encoding downstream human IgGic or IgG4H regions. The vector for expression of chimeric mVK-hlgK was built by amplifying residues 401-731 (gi|63101937|) flanked by Xho I and Not I sites and inserting this into the Xho I - Not I interval of pIRES2-DsRed2 (BD Biosciences). PCR was used to amplify the mAb Vk region from the initiator codon, appending a Nhe I or Spe I site then CACC, to the region encoding (e.g., residue 126 of gi|76779294|), appending a distal Xho I site. The PCR fragment was then cloned into the Nhe I - Not I interval of the above vector. The control human IgGx sequence corresponds to gi|49257887| residues 26-85 and gi|21669402| residues 67-709. The control human IgG4H vector corresponds to residues 12-1473 of gi|19684072| with S229P and L236E substitutions, which stabilize a disulphide bond and abrogate residual FcR interaction [J. Immunol. 164: 1925-1933 (2000)], inserted between the Bgl II and Not I sites of pIRES2-DsRed2 while adding the sequence 5’gctagctgattaattaa 3’ instead of the stop codon. PCR was used to amplify the mAb VH region from the initiator codon, appending CACC then a Bgl II site, to the region encoding residue 473 of gi|19684072|. The PCR fragment was then cloned into the Bgl II - Apa I interval of the above vector. [0253] Expression and purification of Flu ΗΑ1 fusion protein. The Flu HA 1 antigen coding sequence is a CipA protein [Clostridium. thermocellum] gi|479126| residues 147-160 preceding hemagglutinin [Influenza A virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/34(HlNl))] gi|126599271| residues 18-331 with a P321L change and with 6 C-terminal His residues was inserted between the Η chain vector Nhe I and Not I sites to encode recombinant antibody-HAl fusion proteins (rAb.HAl). Similarly, recombinant antibody-PSA fusion proteins (rAb.PSA) were encoded by inserting gi|34784812| prostate specific antigen residues 101-832 with proximal sequence GCTAGCGATACAACAGAACCTGCAACACCTACAACACCTGTAACAACACCGACAACAACA CTTCTAGCGC (SEQ ID ΝΟ.:50) (Nhe I site and CipA spacer) and a distal Not I site into the same Η chain vector. Recombinant antibody proteins were expressed and purified as described above for hFc fusion proteins. In some cases the rAb.antigen coding region and the corresponding L chain coding region were transferred to separate cetHS-puro UCOE vectors (Millipore, CA). The use of UCOE vectors in combination with a preadapted serum free, suspension cell line allowed for rapid production of large quantities of protein \Cytotechnolog)> 38, 43-46 (2002).] CHO-S cells grown in CD-CHO with GlutaMAX and ΗΤ media supplement (Invitrogen) were seeded at 5χ105 ml 24h prior to transfection in 500 ml Coming Ehrlenmyer flasks and incubated in 8% CO2 at 125 rpm. On the day of transfection, 1.2χ107 cells with viability at least 95% were added to a final volume of 30 ml in a 125 ml flask in CD-CHO with GlutaMAX. 48 μΐ of FreeStyle Max reagent (Invitrogen) in 0.6 ml of OptiPRO SFM (Invitrogen) was added with gentle mixing to 24 μg of See I-linearized light chain vector and 24 μg of See I-linearized Η chain vector mixed and sterile filtered in 0.6 ml of OptiPRO SFM. After 20 min, the DNA-lipid complex was slowly added to the 125 ml CHO-S culture flask with swirling. Cells were incubated 24h before adding 30 ml of a combined media solution of CD-CHO with CHO-M5 (Sigma, C0363 component of CHO Kit 1) containing 5 pg/ml of puromycin (A.G. Scientific, CA), 2xGlutaMAX and 0.25xPen/Strep (Invitrogen). At day 2, another 5 μg/ml of puromycin was added directly to the culture and selection was allowed to proceed -10-14 days while following cell viability from six days post transfection. The viable cell count dropped and when the viable density is ~2-3xl06/ml, the cells were transferred to fresh selection medium (CD CHO-S + CHO Μ5 with 2Χ GlutaMAX, 0.25xPen/Strep, 10 gg/ml Puromycin) at 1Ε6/ηύ. Frozen cell stocks were prepared when viability reached >90%. Cells were split in selection medium when cell density exceeded 2xl06/ml until scaled to 4x250 ml in 500 ml flasks. Supernatant was harvested when cell viability dropped below 80% with a maximum final cell density ~7xl06/ml. Endotoxin levels were less than 0.2 units/ml. [0254] Expression and purification of recombinant Flu Ml and MART-1 proteins. PCR was used to amplify the ORF of Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/3 4/Mount Sinai (Η1Ν1) Ml gene while incorporating an Nhe I site distal to the initiator codon and a Not I site distal to the stop codon. The digested fragment was cloned into pET-28b(+) (Novagen), placing the Ml ORF in-frame with a His6 tag, thus encoding His.Flu Ml protein. A pET28b (+) derivative encoding anN-terminal 169 residue cohesin domain from C. thermocellum (unpublished) inserted between the Nco I and Nhe I sites expressed Coh.His.

The proteins were expressed in Ε. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) or Τ7 Express (NEB), grown in LB at 37°C with selection for kanamycin resistance (40 gg/ml) and shaking at 200 rounds/min to mid log phase growth when 120 mg/L IPTG was added. After three hours, the cells were haivested by centrifugation and stored at -80°C. Ε. coli cells from each 1 L fermentation were resuspended in 30 ml ice-cold 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0 (buffer Β) with 0.1 ml of protease inhibitor Cocktail II (Calbiochem, CA). The cells were sonicated on ice 2χ 5 min at setting 18 (Fisher Sonic Dismembrator 60) with a 5 min rest period and then spun at 17,000 r.p.m. (Sorvall SA-600) for 20 min at 4°C. For His.Flu Ml purification the 50 ml cell lysate supernatant fraction was passed through 5 ml Q Sepharose beads and 6.25 ml 160 mM Tris, 40 mM imidazole, 4 Μ NaCl pH 7.9 was added to the Q Sepharose flow through. This was loaded at 4 ml/min onto a 5 ml HiTrap chelating HP column charged with Ni++. The column-bound protein was washed with 20 mM NaPCU, 300 mM NaCl pH 7.6 (buffer D) followed by another wash with 100 mM H3COONa pH 4.0. Bound protein was eluted with 100 mM HsCOONa pH 4.0. The peak fractions were pooled and loaded at 4 ml/min onto a 5 ml HiTrap S column equilibrated with 100 mM H3COONa pH 5.5, and washed with the equilibration buffer followed by elution with a gradient from 0 - 1 Μ NaCl in 50 mM NaPCU pH 5.5. Peak fractions eluting at about 500 mM NaCl were pooled. For Coh.Flu Ml.His purification, cells from 2 L of culture were lysed as above. After centrifugation, 2.5 ml of Triton XI14 was added to the supernatant with incubation on ice for 5 min. After further incubation at 25°C for 5 min, the supernatant was separated from the Triton XI14 following centrifugation at 25°C. The extraction was repeated and the supernatant was passed through 5 ml of Q Sepharose beads and 6.25 ml 160 mM Tris, 40 mM imidazole, 4 Μ NaCl pH 7.9 was added to the Q Sepharose flow through. The protein was then purified by Ni++ chelating chromatography as described above and eluted with 0-500 mM imidazole in buffer D. [0255] Figure 13 shows the internalization of anti-CD40 mAb:IL-4DC. IL-4DCs were treated with 500 ng/ml of anti-CD40-Alexa 568. [0256] Figure 14 shows CD4 and CD8 Τ cell proliferation by DCs targeted with anti-CD40-HAl. 5x10℮3 IFNDCs loaded with 2 ug/ml of anti-CD40-HA or control Ig-HAl were co-cultured with CFSE-labeled autologous CD4+ or CD8+ Τ cells (2χ10℮5) for 7 days. Cells were then then stained with anti-CD4 or anti~CD8 antibodies. Cell proliferation was tested by measuring CFSE-dilution. [0257] Figure 15 shows a titration of ΗΑ1 fusion protein on CD4+ Τ proliferation. IFNDCs (5Κ) loaded with fusion proteins were co-cultured with CFSE-labeled CD4+ Τ cells (200Κ) for 7 days. [0258] Figure 16 shows IFNDCs targeted with anti-CD40-HAl activate ΗΑ1 -specific CD4+ Τ cells. CD4+ Τ cells were restimulated with DCs loaded with 5 uM of indicated peptides, and then intracellular IFNy was stained. [0259] Figure 17 shows IFNDCs targeted with anti-CD40-HAl activate HAl-specific CD4+ Τ cells. CD4+ Τ cells were restimulated with DCs loaded with indicated peptides for 36h, and then culture supernatant was analyzed for measuring IFNy. [0260] Figure 18 shows that targeting CD40 results in enhanced cross-priming of MART-1 specific CD8+ Τ cells. IFNDCs (5ΚΛν℮11) loaded with fusion proteins were co-cultured with purified CD8+ Τ cells for 10 days. Cells were stained with anti~CD8 and tetramer. Cells are from healthy donors (HLA-A*0201+). [0261] Figure 19 shows targeting CD40 results in enhanced cross-priming of MART-1 specific CD8+ Τ cells (Summary of 8-repeated experiments using cells from different healthy donors). [0262] Figure 20 shows CD8+ CTL induced with IFNDCs targeted with anti-CD40-MART-l are functional. CD8+ Τ cells co-cultured with IFNDCs targeted with fusion proteins were mixed with Τ2 cells loaded with 10 uM peptide epitope. [0263] Figure 21 shows CD8+ CTL induced with IFNDCs targeted with anti-CD40-Flu Ml are functional. CD8+ Τ cells co-cultured with IFNDCs targeted with fusion proteins were mixed with Τ2 cells loaded with 1.0 ηΜ peptide epitope. [0264] Figure 22 shows an outline of protocol to test the ability a vaccine composed of anti-CD4012E12 linked to PSA (prostate specific antigen) to elicit the expansion from a naive Τ cell population. PSA-specific CD4+ Τ cells corresponding to a broad array of PSA epitopes. Briefly, DCs derived by culture with IFNa and GM-CSF of monocytes from a healthy donor are incubated with the vaccine. The next day, cells are placed in fresh medium and pure CD4+ Τ cells from the same donor are added. Several days later, PSA peptides are added and, after four hours, secreted gamma-IFN levels in the culture supernatants are determined. [0265] Figure 23 shows that many PSA peptides elicit potent gamma-IFN-production responses indicating that anti-CD4012E12 and similar anti-CD40 agents can efficiently deliver antigen to DCs, resulting in the priming of immune responses against multiple epitopes of the antigen. The peptide mapping of PSA antigens. 5x10℮3 IFNDCs loaded with 2 ug/ml of anti-CD40-PSA were co-cultured with purified autologous CD4+ Τ cells (2χ10℮5) for 8 days. Cells were then restimulated with 5 uM of individual peptides derived from PSA for 36h. The amount of IFNy was measured by Luminex. Cells are from healthy donors. [0266] Figure 24 shows DCs targeted with anti-CD40-PSA induce PSA-specific CD8+ Τ cell responses. IFNDCs were targeted with 1 ug mAb fusion protein with PSA. Purified autologous CD8+ Τ cells were co-cultured for 10 days. Cells were stained with anti-CD8 and PSA (KLQCVDLHV)tetramer. Cells are from a HLA-A*0201 positive healthy donor. The results demonstrate that anti-CD40 effectively deliver PSA to the DCs, which in turn elicit the expansion of PSA-specific CD8+ Τ cells. Briefly, 5x10℮3 IFNDCs loaded with 2 ug/ml of anti-CD40-PSA were co-cultured with purified autologous CD8+ Τ cells (2χ10℮5) for 10 days. Cells were then stained with tetramer. Cells are from HLA-0*201 positive healthy donor.

Cells were then restimulated with with 5 uM of individual peptides derived from CyclinDl for 5h in the presence of Brefeldin A. Cells were stained for measuring intracellular IFNy expression. [0268] Figure 26 shows a peptide scan and IFNy production by Τ cells obtained from the pools of peptides shown in Figure 25 and control for Donor 2. 5χ10℮3 IFNDCs loaded with 2 ug/ml of anti-CD40-Cyclin D1 were co-cultured with purified autologous CD4+ Τ cells (2χ10℮5) for 8 days. Cells were then restimulated with with 5 uM of individual peptides derived from CyclinDl for 5h in the presence of Brefeldin A. Cells were stained for measuring intracellular IFNy expression. [0269] In conclusion, delivering antigens to DCs, the most potent antigen presenting cells, via CD40 is an efficient way to induce and activate antigen specific both CD4+ and CD8+ Τ cell-mediated immunity. Thus, vaccines made of anti-CD40 mAh will induce potent immunity against cancer and infections.

MART-1 is a tumor-associated melanocytic differentiation antigen. Vaccination with MART-1 antigen may stimulate a host cytotoxic T-cell response against tumor cells expressing the melanocytic differentiation antigen, resulting in tumor cell lysis. [0323] Figure 27 shows the expression and construct design for anti-CD40-MART-l peptide antibodies. Figure 28 is a summary of the CD4+ and CD8+ immunodominant epitopes for MART-1. Figures 27 and 28 show the use of the flexible linker technology to permit the successful expression of recombinant anti-DC receptor targeting antibodies fused to significant (-2/3) parts of human MART-1. Recombinant antibody fused at the Η chain C-terminus to the entire MART-1 coding region is not at all secreted from production mammalian cells [not shown]. The Flex-vl-hMART-1-Pep-3-f4-Pep-l adduct is particularly well expressed and is one preferred embodiment of a MART-1-targeting vaccine, as is the Flex-vl-hMART-l-Pep-3-f4-Pep-l-f3-Pep-2 adduct which bears a maximum load of MART-1 epitopes. Slide 2 of the MART-1 powerpoint presentation shows that these adducts can be successfully appended to multiple anti-DC receptor vehicles. [0324] The sequence below is a Η chain - hMART-1 peptides string of ρ℮ρ3-ρ℮ρ1-ρ℮ρ2 fusion protein where each hMARTl peptide sequence [bold-italics] is separated by a inter-peptide spacer f [shown in bold]. In this case, a 27-amino-acid long linker flex-vl(vl) [italics] derived from cellulosomal anchoring scaffoldin Β precursor [Bacteroides cellulosolvens- described in the gag-nef vaccine invention disclosure] was inserted between the Η chain C-terminus and the hMARTl peptides-flexible spaces string. The underlined AS residues are joining sequences.

Cyclin Bl, also known as CCNB1, is a human gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in mitosis. Cyclin Β1 complexes with p34(cdc2) to form the maturationpromoting factor (MPF). Two alternative transcripts are known that are the result of alternative transcription initiation sites. A first transcript encodes a constitutively expressed transcript. The second transcript is a cell cycle-regulated transcript expressed predominantly during G2/M phase. [0372] Figures 34Α and 34Β shows that full-length Cyclin Bl fused to the C-terminus of either antibody Η chain or cohesion fail to be secreted from mammalian 293F cells. The data are anti-human Fc and anti-cohesin ELISA on serial dilutions of transfection supernatants. rAb.Cyclin Bl and Coh.Cyclin Bl proteins are poorly expressed as products secreted from mammalian cells.

D-type cyclins are predominantly expressed in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The expression pattern of cyclin D1 has been extensively studied in certain cancer types including lymphoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Approximately 30 percent of breast carcinomas are Cyclin D1 positive. Over expression of Cyclin D1 is now a well established criterion for the diagnosis of Mantle Cell Lymphoma, a malignant, non-Hodglcin's lymphoma which is characterized by a unique chromosomal translocation t(l 1;14).

[0395] Figure 36 shows that Cyclin D1 segments pi, ρ3, and ρ4, but not ρ2 express well as direct fusions to the Η chain C-terminus. These are transient transfections of the Η chain vectors co-transfected with the L chain expression vector into 293F cells and the supernatants harvested after 48-72 hours of expression. The Cyclin D1 ρ3+ρ4 segments joined together at the Η chain C-terminus also express well, but various other combinations, with and without interspersed flex segments do not express, or express very poorly. [0396] Figure 37 shows the relative expression levels of various Cyclin D1 segments as direct fusions to the Η chain C-terminus in various combinations with flexible linker sequences. These are transient transfections of the Η chain vectors co-transfected with the L chain expression vector into 293F cells and the supernatants harvested after 48-72 hours of expression. The Cyclin D1 p24p3+p4+f4 segments joined together at the Η chain C-terminus also express well enough for vaccine production.
