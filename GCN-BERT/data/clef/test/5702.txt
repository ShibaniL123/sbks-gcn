BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Technical Field The present invention relates to novel compounds which modulate the activity of RORγ and their use as medicaments. 2. Background Information RORγ (retinoic acid receptor related orphan receptor gamma) (also referred to as “RORγt”) is a transcription factor belonging to the steroid hormone receptor superfamily (reviewed in Jetten 2006. Adv. Dev Biol. 16: 313-355). RORγ has been identified as a transcriptional factor that is required for the differentiation of T cells and secretion of Interleukin 17 (IL-17) from a subset of T cells termed Th17 cells (Ivanov, Cell 2006, 126, 1121-1133). The rationale for the use of a RORγ targeted therapy for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases is based on the emerging evidence that Th17 cells and the cytokine IL-17 contribute to the initiation and progression of the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease (reviewed in Miossec, Nature Drug Discovery 2012, 11, 763-776; see also Khan et al., Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 23 (2013), 532-536). The outcome of recent clinical trials with neutralizing antibodies to IL-17 and its receptor IL-17RA (Leonardi 2012, New England Journal of Medicine, 366, 1190-1199; Papp 2012, New England Journal of Medicine 366, 1181-1189) in psoriasis highlight the role of IL-17 in the pathogenesis of this disease. As such, attenuation of IL-17 secretion from activated Th17 T cells via inhibition of RORγ may offer similar therapeutic benefit. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention comprises a novel class of heteroaromatic compounds and methods for making and using the same, said compounds having the general structure of formula (I), wherein the substituent groups are as herein defined: These compounds are useful for the treatment of autoimmune and allergic disorders in that they exhibit good modulatory effect upon RORγ. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions and Conventions Used Terms that are not specifically defined here have the meanings that would be apparent to a person skilled in the art, in the light of the overall disclosure and the context as a whole. As used herein, the following definitions apply, unless stated otherwise: The use of the prefix Cx-y, wherein x and y each represent a natural number, indicates that the chain or ring structure or combination of chain and ring structure as a whole, specified and mentioned in direct association, may consist of a maximum of y and a minimum of x number of carbon atoms. In general, for groups comprising two or more subgroups, unless otherwise indicated the last named subgroup is the radical attachment point, for example, the substituent “aryl-C1-3-alkyl” means an aryl group which is bound to a C1-3-alkyl-group, the latter of which is bound to the core or to the group to which the substituent is attached. However, if a bond is depicted just prior to the first named subgroup, then that first named subgroup is the radical attachment point, for example, the substituent “—S(O)nC1-6alkyl” means a C1-6-alkyl-group which is bound to an S(O)n group, the latter of which is bound to the core or to the group to which the substituent is attached. Alkyl denotes monovalent, saturated hydrocarbon chains, which may be present in both straight-chain (unbranched) and branched form. If an alkyl is substituted, the substitution may take place independently of one another, by mono- or polysubstitution in each case, on all the hydrogen-carrying carbon atoms. For example, the term “C1-5alkyl” includes for example H3C—, H3C—CH2—, H3C—CH2—CH2—, H3C—CH(CH3)—, H3C—CH2—CH2—CH2—, H3C—CH2—CH(CH3)—, H3C—CH(CH3)—CH2—, H3C—C(CH3)2—, H3C—CH2—CH2—CH2—CH2—, H3C—CH2—CH2—CH(CH3)—, H3C—CH2—CH(CH3)—CH2—, H3C—CH(CH3)—CH2—CH2—, H3C—CH2—C(CH3)2—, H3C—C(CH3)2—CH2—, H3C—CH(CH3)—CH(CH3)— and H3C—CH2—CH(CH2CH3)—. Further examples of alkyl are methyl (Me; —CH3), ethyl (Et; —CH2CH3), 1-propyl (n-propyl; n-Pr; —CH2CH2CH3), 2-propyl (i-Pr; iso-propyl; —CH(CH3)2), 1-butyl (n-butyl; n-Bu; —CH2CH2CH2CH3), 2-methyl-1-propyl (iso-butyl; i-Bu; —CH2CH(CH3)2), 2-butyl (sec-butyl; sec-Bu; —CH(CH3)CH2CH3), 2-methyl-2-propyl (tert-butyl; t-Bu; —C(CH3)3), 1-pentyl n-pentyl; —CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3), 2-pentyl (—CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3), 3-pentyl (—CH(CH2CH3)2), 3-methyl-1-butyl (iso-pentyl; —CH2CH2CH(CH3)2), 2-methyl-2-butyl (—C(CH3)2CH2CH3), 3-methyl-2-butyl (—CH(CH3)CH(CH3)2), 2,2-dimethyl-1-propyl(neo-pentyl; —CH2C(CH3)3), 2-methyl-1-butyl (—CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3), 1-hexyl (n-hexyl; —CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3), 2-hexyl (—CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH2CH3), 3-hexyl (—CH(CH2CH3)(CH2CH2CH3)), 2-methyl-2-pentyl (—C(CH3)2CH2CH2CH3), 3-methyl-2-pentyl (—CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH2CH3), 4-methyl-2-pentyl (—CH(CH3)CH2CH(CH3)2), 3-methyl-3-pentyl (—C(CH3)(CH2CH3)2), 2-methyl-3-pentyl (—CH(CH2CH3)CH(CH3)2), 2,3-dimethyl-2-butyl (—C(CH3)2CH(CH3)2), 3,3-dimethyl-2-butyl (—CH(CH3)C(CH3)3), 2,3-dimethyl-1-butyl (—CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH3), 2,2-dimethyl-1-butyl (—CH2C(CH3)2CH2CH3), 3,3-dimethyl-1-butyl (—CH2CH2C(CH3)3), 2-methyl-1-pentyl (—CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3), 3-methyl-1-pentyl (—CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3), 1-heptyl (n-heptyl), 2-methyl-1-hexyl, 3-methyl-1-hexyl, 2,2-dimethyl-1-pentyl, 2,3-dimethyl-1-pentyl, 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentyl, 3,3-dimethyl-1-pentyl, 2,2,3-trimethyl-1-butyl, 3-ethyl-1-pentyl, 1-octyl (n-octyl), 1-nonyl (n-nonyl); 1-decyl (n-decyl) etc. By the terms propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl etc. without any further definition are meant saturated hydrocarbon groups with the corresponding number of carbon atoms, wherein all isomeric forms are included. The above definition for alkyl also applies if alkyl is a part of another (combined) group such as for example Cx-yalkylamino or Cx-yalkoxy. Unlike alkyl, alkenyl, when used alone or in combination, consists of at least two carbon atoms, wherein at least two adjacent carbon atoms are joined together by a C—C double bond and a carbon atom can only be part of one C—C double bond. If in an alkyl as hereinbefore defined having at least two carbon atoms, two hydrogen atoms on adjacent carbon atoms are formally removed and the free valencies are saturated to form a second bond, the corresponding alkenyl is formed. Alkenyl may optionally be present in the cis or trans or E or Z orientation with regard to the double bond(s). Unlike alkyl, alkynyl, when used alone or in combination, consists of at least two carbon atoms, wherein at least two adjacent carbon atoms are joined together by a C—C triple bond. If in an alkyl as hereinbefore defined having at least two carbon atoms, two hydrogen atoms in each case at adjacent carbon atoms are formally removed and the free valencies are saturated to form two further bonds, the corresponding alkynyl is formed. Haloalkyl (haloalkenyl, haloalkynyl), when used alone or in combination, is derived from the previously defined alkyl (alkenyl, alkynyl) by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms of the hydrocarbon chain independently of one another by halogen atoms, which may be identical or different. If a haloalkyl (haloalkenyl, haloalkynyl) is to be further substituted, the substitutions may take place independently of one another, in the form of mono- or polysubstitutions in each case, on all the hydrogen-carrying carbon atoms. Examples of haloalkyl (haloalkenyl, haloalkynyl) are —CF3, —CHF2, —CH2F, —CF2CF3, —CHFCF3, —CH2CF3, —CF2CH3, —CHFCH3, —CF2CF2CF3, —CF2CH2CH3, —CF═CF2, —CCl═CH2, —CBr═CH2, —C≡C—CF3, —CHFCH2CH3, —CHFCH2CF3 etc. Halogen relates to fluorine, chlorine, bromine and/or iodine atoms. The term “cycloalkyl”, when used alone or in combination, refers to a nonaromatic 3 to 12-membered (but preferably, 3 to 6-membered) monocyclic carbocyclic radical or a nonaromatic 6 to 10-membered fused bicyclic, bridged bicyclic, propellane or spirocyclic carbocyclic radical. The C3-12 cycloalkyl may be either saturated or partially unsaturated, and the carbocycle may be attached by any atom of the cycle which results in the creation of a stable structure.

The compounds of the invention are only those which are contemplated to be chemically stable as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. For example, a compound which would have a “dangling valency”, or a carbanion are not compounds contemplated by the inventive methods disclosed herein. Unless specifically indicated, throughout the specification and appended claims, a given chemical formula or name shall encompass tautomers and all stereo, optical and geometrical isomers (e.g. enantiomers, diastereomers, E/Z isomers, etc.) and racemates thereof as well as mixtures in different proportions of the separate enantiomers, mixtures of diastereomers, or mixtures of any of the foregoing forms where such isomers and enantiomers exist, as well as salts, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and their corresponding unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol and the like. Compounds of the invention also include their isotopically-labelled forms. An isotopically-labelled form of an active agent of a combination of the present invention is identical to said active agent but for the fact that one or more atoms of said active agent have been replaced by an atom or atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number of said atom which is usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes which are readily available commercially and which can be incorporated into an active agent of a combination of the present invention in accordance with well established procedures, include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, e.g., 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36Cl, respectively. An active agent of a combination of the present invention, a prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of either which contains one or more of the above-mentioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms is contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, and commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, perchloric, fumaric, maleic, phosphoric, glycolic, lactic, salicylic, succinic, toluene-p-sulfuric, tartaric, acetic, citric, methanesulfonic, formic, benzoic, malonic, naphthalene-2-sulfuric and benzenesulfonic acids. Other acids, such as oxalic acid, while not themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be formed with cations from metals like aluminium, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like (also see Pharmaceutical salts, Birge, S. M. et al., J. Pharm. Sci., (1977), 66, 1-19). The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesised from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base form of these compounds with a sufficient amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic diluent like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile, or a mixture thereof. By a therapeutically effective amount for the purposes of this invention is meant a quantity of substance that is capable of obviating symptoms of illness or alleviating these symptoms, or which prolong the survival of a treated patient.

General Synthetic Methods The compounds according to the invention may be prepared by the methods of synthesis, synthetic examples, methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art and methods reported in the chemical literature. In the methods of synthesis and examples described hereinafter, the substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, and W shall have the meanings defined hereinbefore in the detailed description of the compounds of formula I. These methods that are described here are intended as an illustration and for the enablement of the instant invention without restricting the scope of its subject matter, the claimed compounds, and the examples. Where the preparation of starting compounds is not described, they are commercially obtainable, may be prepared analogously to compounds or methods described herein, or are described in the chemical literature. Unless otherwise specified, solvents, temperatures, pressures, and other reaction conditions may be readily selected by one of ordinary skill in the art. Amine intermediates of formula R1—W—C(R2)(R3)—NH2 are either commercially available, may be prepared according to the general procedures or references described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,879,873 and WO 2011/049917, or may be prepared by one skilled in the art using methods described in the chemical literature. Compounds of formula (I) may be prepared from intermediate A′ according to Scheme I. As illustrated in Scheme I, a suitable pyrimidine of formula A′, wherein G is NH2, X is a suitable group for palladium-mediated cross coupling reactions (e.g., I, Br, Cl, or OSO2CF3), and Y is a suitable leaving group (e.g., Cl), may be reacted with a suitable amine or amine salt (e.g., hydrochloride salt) of formula R4NH2 such as isopropyl amine in the presence of a suitable base (e.g., i-Pr2EtN, or Et3N) in a suitable solvent (e.g., n-butanol) and under a suitable reaction conditions such as an appropriate temperature (e.g., about 120° C.) to provide a compound of formula B′. Alternatively, the said pyrimidine of formula A′ wherein G is a suitable synthetic precursor for NH2 (e.g., a nitro group) may be reacted with a suitable amine or amine salt (e.g., hydrochloride salt) of formula R4NH2 such as 1-methyl cyclopropylamine in the presence of a suitable reagent and solvent (e.g., i-Pr2EtN and THF, respectively), and under a suitable reaction conditions such as an appropriate temperature (e.g., about −78° C. to about 25° C.) to afford an intermediate, which may be converted to a compound of formula B′ upon further reaction with suitable reagents (e.g., a NO2 group that may be reduced with a suitable reagent such as SnCl2). The selection of a suitable amine of formula R4NH2 and pyrimidine of formula A′ for the aforementioned reaction by a person skilled in the art may be based on criteria such as steric and electronic nature of the amine and the pyrimidine. A diaminopyrimidine of formula B′ may be reacted with a suitable reagent such as chloro-oxo-acetic acid ethyl ester in a suitable solvent (e.g., acetone) and in the presence of a suitable base (e.g., K2CO3) to furnish a compound of formula C′. A dicarbonyl compound of formula C′ may be reacted with a suitable dehydrochlorinating reagent such as oxalyl chloride in the presence of a suitable additive (e.g., a catalytic amount of DMF) in a suitable solvent (e.g., CH2Cl2), and under a suitable reaction conditions such as an appropriate temperature (e.g., about ambient temperature) to provide a compound of formula D′. A chloro-pteridinone of formula D′ may be reacted with a suitable amine or amine salt of formula R1—W—C(R2)(R3)—NH2 such as 4-ethanesulfonyl benzyl amine in the presence of a suitable base (e.g., Et3N) in a suitable solvent (e.g., THF) and under a suitable reaction conditions such as an appropriate temperature (e.g., about ambient temperature) to yields a compound of formula E′. A pyrimidine of formula E′ may be heated with a suitable cross-coupling partner (e.g., a boronic acid) and a suitable base (e.g., K3PO4), in a suitable solvent (e.g., 1,4-dioxane), in the presence of a suitable cross-coupling catalyst (e.g., Pd(dppf)Cl2), under suitable reaction conditions such as a suitable atmosphere (e.g., argon) and at a suitable temperature (e.g., about 100° C.) to provide a compound of formula (I).

Reporter Gene Assay (RGA) A nuclear receptor transactivation assay is performed to quantitate the ability of test compounds to inhibit RORγ transactivation of a luciferase reporter. A similar assay is described in: Khan et al., Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 23 (2013), 532-536. The system uses transiently transfected HEK 293 cells cotransfected with two plasmids (pGL4.3, luc2P/GAL4UAS/Hygro, and pBIND, Ga14DBD hRORC LBD1-3). The positive control is co-transiently transfected with both plasmids, and the negative control contains the pGL4.3 promoter sequence. Assays are assembled in 384 well plates where transiently transfected cells and test compound at varying concentrations are incubated for 20-24 h. The next day, assays plates are taken out and equilibrated at RT for 20-30 minutes. Bright-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System is used to detect Luciferase production. After addition of Bright GLO detection reagent, the plates are incubated at RT for 20 minutes. The plates are read on an Envision plate reader to measure luminescence signal. The RLU signal is converted to POC relative to control and blank wells.
