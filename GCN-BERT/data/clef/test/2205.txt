This application is a continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 8,439,862 entitled “Infusion Apparatus With Flow Indicator” by Roger Dillard Massengale, filed Dec. 10, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to liquid dispensing systems, and more specifically to a catheter-based system for infusing a liquid into the body of a patient, and most specifically to a pain management system which administers a post-operative drug to a wound site of a patient through a catheter that delivers fluid medication uniformly and at a known rate across an infusion section of the catheter. BACKGROUND In instances of severe pain, infection, and other medical ailments, it has been proven beneficial to administer a continuous flow of medicinal fluid to a patient through a catheter-based system. There are many types of medicinal fluids that can be administered in this manner including, but not limited to, insulin, analgesics and antibiotics. The continuous delivery of such medicinal fluids over extended periods of time has required prolonged hospital stays and monitoring by medical staff. Devices for this purpose have been designed to be fairly mobile and provide for a continuous or basal rate of fluid, which is the on-going continuous primary flow rate of fluid to a patient. However, one problem that is not successfully addressed is readily determining whether the flow of fluid to the patient has been altered or interrupted. Very often, the rates of flow are in the range of from about 1 to about 14 cubic centimeters of fluid per hour. At such low flow rates, it is difficult to determine if the flow is inadvertently altered or interrupted by, for example, material collecting in a filter, orifice, connection, or in a flow regulator to block or alter the flow rate. Alternatively and/or additionally, the flow path may become pinched, constricted or kinked to alter or interrupt the flow rate. An interruption in flow alters the pressure of fluid in the tubing. Various hydrostatic manometers have been developed that may be directly placed in the tubing line and that may be operated to temporarily interrupt the fluid flow so that hydrostatic pressure measurements may be periodically taken. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,807,389 to Miller et al. These types of in-line manometers measure hydrostatic pressure and require periodic interruption of the fluid flow, such as by a stopcock, to obtain a pressure reading. This is inconvenient in some situations and may even be hazardous if the required pressure level drops or rises significantly between readings, resulting in over- or under infusion. An in-line, hydrodynamic manometer for measuring infusion pressures is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,282,881 to Todd et al. This manometer uses a closed pressure-measuring chamber containing a nonexpansible volume of air, which is in communication with a passage through which fluid, whose pressure is to be measured, flows. Several problems exist with this manometer design. For example, the entire apparatus is rather large in order to accommodate a pressure-measuring chamber long enough to measure a given range of pressures. The manometer, as illustrated in FIG. 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,282,881, is large enough to require support on a stand. There are numerous markings on the housing of the manometer, as shown in FIG. 2 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,282,881, which correspond to various hydrodynamic pressure readings of the fluid flowing through the passage. Again, this results in the need for a relatively long pressure-measuring chamber and thus a relatively large manometer apparatus. Furthermore, because the pressure of intravenous infusions is typically low, from approximately 6 psi at the fluid source to approximately 0.3 psi at the patient's vein, clinical personnel generally do not care about, nor do they need to know, absolute hydrodynamic pressures during intravenous (“IV”) infusion of fluid. What is clinically important is whether and when the flow is in one of three states: 1) flowing relatively freely; 2) obstructed by a distal blockage (i.e., downstream from the manometer, typically at the site of insertion of the catheter into the patient); or 3) not flowing at all, either because the infusion is turned off or there is a proximal obstruction (i.e., upstream from the manometer, typically close to the fluid source and/or within the associated delivery tubing). Thus, the traditional manometer scale with a wide array of absolute pressure markings is, generally, clinically unnecessary. An improved manometer is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,371,937. This device functions as a conventional manometer with a pressure-measuring chamber but includes an additional space-saving chamber connected to the pressure-measuring chamber that allows the manometer to be much smaller than conventional devices. Fluid flows through the device and also enters the pressure-measuring chamber where it reaches a level through compression and expansion of air in both the pressure-measuring chamber and space-saving chamber. This scaled down device includes simple markings corresponding to fluid flow states. However, the device is still a manometer and required fluid to enter a pressure-measuring chamber. Moreover, the device must be aligned and oriented properly to obtain a reading. That is, the flow state of fluid within the passage is determined by an examiner, typically a nurse or other caregiver, by ascertaining where the leading edge, or top, of the fluid column within the pressure-measuring chamber is in comparison to certain reference markings that are associated with, and are present alongside, the pressure-measuring chamber. In addition to these problems, at very low flow rates and/or very low pressures (e.g., essentially atmospheric pressures) changes in the flow rate or pressure are difficult to detect. What is needed is a simple, mobile device to provide a continuous and substantially constant flow of medicinal fluid and indicate a fluid flow condition in a clear, discrete and easy to identify manner. Further, a simple and effective device that indicates a fluid flow condition in a clear, discrete and easy to identify manner such that it can be readily identified by even a busy care provider or an infirm patient. Accordingly, there is a need for an indicator assembly that can be readily integrated into liquid dispensing systems, and more specifically to a catheter-based system for infusing a liquid into the body of a patient and which is easy to view and read properly and function at low flow rates of less than 14 cubic centimeters of fluid per hour, desirably between 1 and 14 cubic centimeters per hour. There is also a need for an indicator assembly that can be readily integrated into a catheter-based liquid dispensing system for infusing a liquid into the body of a patient and which is easy to view and read properly and function at relatively low flow rates and at pressures less than about 4 pounds per square inch (28 kilopascals). A need exists for an indicator assembly that be readily integrated into a catheter-based liquid dispensing system for infusing a liquid into the body of a patient that is simple, reliable and accurate. A need also exists for an indicator assembly that be readily integrated into a catheter-based liquid dispensing system for infusing a liquid into the body of a patient that is simple, reliable and accurate at indicating predetermined pressures as well as easy to understand. There is also an unmet need for a pressure change indicator assembly that conveys a simple and easy to see and understand signal about a change in a fluid flow condition. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In response to the difficulties and problems discussed herein, the present invention provides a device for dispensing fluid to a patient and indicating a fluid flow condition. The device includes a reservoir configured to provide a source of fluid under pressure. A continuous flow path in fluid communication with the source of fluid provides a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid from the source to a patient. The device further includes at least one pre-biased indicator in fluid communication with the continuous flow path. The pre-biased indicator is configured to provide a discrete visual signal that the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is different from a predetermined level of pressure, thereby indicating a fluid flow condition. In an aspect of the invention, the continuous flow path may include a flow regulator which sets the flow rate through the continuous flow path into the patient. The pre-biased indicator may be located between the flow regulator and the source of fluid. Alternatively and/or additionally, the pre-biased indicator may be located in a direction downstream of the flow regulator. The pre-biased indicator is configured to provide a discrete visual signal that the pressure of a fluid in the continuous flow path has changed from a predetermined level of pressure associated with a fluid flow state. For example, the pre-biased indicator may be configured to provide a discrete visual signal that the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is less than the predetermined level of pressure. Alternatively, the pre-biased indicator may be configured to provide a discrete visual signal that the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is greater than the predetermined level of pressure. In another aspect of the invention, when a pre-biased indicator is located between a flow regulator (or other potential source of obstruction such as a filter or bubble-trap) and the pressurized source of fluid and the pre-biased indicator provides a discrete visual signal that the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is less than the predetermined level of pressure, such a signal indicates a flow state that is less than a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid. In yet another aspect of the invention, when a pre-biased indicator is located in a direction downstream of a flow regulator (or other potential source of obstruction such as a filter or bubble-trap) and the pre-biased indicator provides a discrete visual signal that the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is greater than the predetermined level of pressure, such a signal indicates a flow state that is less than a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid. Generally speaking, the pre-biased indicator includes a housing having an axial dimension, a flexible sleeve fitted within the housing, and a biasing element in communication with the flexible sleeve. The biasing element is configured to deform at a predetermined pressure so the flexible sleeve travels along the axis of the housing from a first axial position to a second axial position. The first position of the flexible sleeve may provide a discrete visual signal that the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is less than the predetermined level of pressure and the second position of the flexible sleeve provides a discrete visual signal that the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is greater than the predetermined level of pressure. The housing may be configured so the flexible sleeve is visible through at least a portion of the housing while the flexible sleeve is in its first position. Alternatively, the housing may be configured so the flexible sleeve is visible through at least a portion of the housing while the flexible sleeve is in its second position. The housing of the pre-biased indicator may include a first end, a second end, one or more walls defining an interior channel, and an axial dimension. The first end of the housing is in fluid communication with the continuous flow path. Desirably, at least a portion of the housing is transparent or translucent. The pre-biased indicator further includes a flexible sleeve positioned within the interior channel of the housing. The flexible sleeve has a first surface, an opposed second surface, a first end located within the interior channel of the housing, a second end engaged with the housing to create a fluid impervious seal, and a flexible, generally annular portion joining the first end and second end of the sleeve. According to the invention, the flexible, generally annular portion of the flexible sleeve defines a rolling annular fold intermediate the first end and the second end of the sleeve. The rolling annular fold is configured so that at least a portion of the first surface of the flexible sleeve is generally adjacent the one or more housing walls and at least a portion of the second surface of the flexible sleeve defines a sleeve cavity. Generally speaking, the rolling annular fold travels as the sleeve moves in the axial direction of the housing. That is, movement of the flexible sleeve in an axial direction causes a portion of the second surface of the flexible sleeve to evert or turn inside out at the rolling annular fold so that it becomes directly adjacent the one or more housing walls. The assembly also includes a biasing element located at least partially within the sleeve cavity and between the first end of the housing and the second end of the housing. The biasing element is configured to deform at a defined force that corresponds to a predetermined pressure in the continuous flow path so the flexible sleeve moves from a first axial position to at least a second axial position to provide a discrete visual signal that the pressure of a fluid in the continuous flow path is different from predetermined pressure that corresponds to a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid. The biasing element is a deformable device or component that distorts due to compressive forces yet recovers to its original shape when the compressive forces are removed. The biasing element may be a spring, such as a coil spring, a plurality of springs, an elastomeric body or the like. The biasing element may have a spring rate or a deformation rate or tripping point of between about 0.1 lbs-force/inch to about 1.0 lbs-force/inch (about 0.1 newtons/cm to about 1.8 newtons/cm) which provides a discrete signal of change in pressure, particularly for pressures below about 4 pounds per square inch (psi) (about 28 kilopascals), for example, for pressures of from 1 to about 3.5 pounds per square inch (approximately 7 to about 25 kilopascals), or as another example, for pressures of from about 2 to about 3 pounds per square inch (approximately 14 to about 21 kilopascals). The present invention also encompasses an indicator assembly for indicating a fluid flow state in a medical device for dispensing a fluid under pressure to a patient through a continuous flow path at a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid. The indicator assembly includes a pre-biased indicator in fluid communication with the continuous flow path that provides a first discrete visual signal when the pressure of the fluid in the flow path is at a predetermined pressure and a second discrete visual signal when the pressure of the fluid in the flow path is no longer at a predetermined pressure such that the second discrete visual signal provides warning that indicates a flow state that is less than a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid. The pre-biased indicator may be configured to be a binary indicator and provide no signal of other pressure states between the first discrete visual signal and the second discrete visual signal. Generally speaking, the pre-biased indicator is as described above and includes a housing having an axial dimension, a flexible sleeve fitted within the housing, and a biasing element in communication with the flexible sleeve, the biasing element being configured to deform at a predetermined pressure so the flexible sleeve travels along the axis of the housing from a first axial position to a second axial position. The pre-biased indicator of the indicator assembly may include a housing having a first end, a second end, one or more walls defining an interior channel, and an axial dimension, the first end of the housing being in fluid communication with the continuous flow path, and at least a portion of the housing being transparent or translucent. The indicator may further include a flexible sleeve positioned within the interior channel of the housing, the flexible sleeve comprising: a first surface, an opposed second surface, a first end located within the interior channel of the housing near the first end of the housing and in fluid communication with the continuous flow path, a second end sealingly engaged with the housing, and a flexible, generally annular portion joining the first end and second end of the sleeve, the annular portion defining a rolling annular fold intermediate the first end and the second end such that at least a portion of the first surface of the flexible sleeve is generally adjacent the one or more housing walls and at least a portion of the second surface of the flexible sleeve defines a sleeve cavity. A biasing element may be located at least partially within the sleeve cavity and between the first end of the housing and the second end of the housing, the biasing element being configured to deform at a predetermined pressure so the first end of the flexible sleeve moves from a first axial position to at least a second axial position to provide a discrete visual signal that the pressure of a fluid in the continuous flow path is different from the predetermined level of pressure. The movement of the flexible sleeve in an axial direction causes a portion of the second surface of the flexible sleeve to evert at the rolling annular fold so that it becomes directly adjacent the one or more housing walls. The present invention encompasses a system for dispensing fluid to a patient and indicating a fluid flow condition. The system includes: a reservoir for providing a source of fluid under pressure; a continuous flow path in fluid communication with the source of fluid for providing a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid from the source; and at least one pre-biased indicator in fluid communication with the continuous flow path, such that the at least one pre-biased indicator provides a discrete visual signal when the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is different from a predetermined level of pressure, thereby indicating a fluid flow condition. The system may further include a flow regulator and a pre-biased indicator may be located between the flow regulator and the source of fluid such that the pre-biased indicator provides a discrete visual signal when the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is less than the predetermined level of pressure and such a discrete visual signal indicates a flow state that is less than a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid. Alternatively and/or additionally, the system may include a flow regulator and a pre-biased indicator may be located in a direction downstream of a flow regulator such that the pre-biased indicator provides a discrete visual signal when the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is greater than the predetermined level of pressure and such a signal indicates a flow state that is less than a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid. A better understanding of the above and many other features and advantages of the liquid dispensing device with flow indicator may be obtained from a consideration of the detailed description of the invention below, particularly if such consideration is made in conjunction with the appended drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to liquid dispensing systems, and more specifically to a catheter-based system for infusing a liquid into the body of a patient. More particularly, the invention relates to a pain management system which administers a post-operative drug to a wound site of a patient through a catheter that delivers fluid medication uniformly and at a known rate across an infusion section of the catheter and which incorporate an indicator that provides a discrete visual signal that pressure in the continuous flow path is different from a predetermined level of pressure. The invention disclosed herein also relates to an indicator assembly for use with a fluid delivery device in which the indicator assembly includes a pre-biased indicator that provides a discrete visual signal that pressure in a continuous flow path of such a fluid delivery device is different from a predetermined level of pressure. Reference will now be made in detail to one or more embodiments of the invention, examples of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example and embodiment is provided by way of explanation of the invention, and is not meant as a limitation of the invention. For example, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment may be used with another embodiment to yield still a further embodiment. It is intended that the invention include these and other modifications and variations as coming within the scope and spirit of the invention. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the present invention encompasses a device 300 for dispensing fluid to a patient and indicating a flow condition of the fluid through the device. The device 300 includes a reservoir 302 that serves as a pressurized fluid source or pump that holds medicinal fluid, such as local anesthetics (referred to hereinafter as a “pump”) and that is configured to provide a source of fluid under pressure. The pump 302 forces the medicinal fluid through a conduit 304. The conduit 304 forms a continuous flow path 306 for delivery into a wound site nerve bundle or the blood stream of a patient P. In configurations that provide for bolus delivery as illustrated in FIG. 2, the conduit 304 splits into a continuous or primary flow path 306 and into a controlled bolus flow path 308 for delivery into a wound site nerve bundle or the blood stream of a patient P. The pump 302 preferably accommodates about from 100 to 500 ml of fluid under 10-15 psi. The pump 302 has an inner core 316 surrounded by an elastomeric chamber 318 within a housing 320. The core 316 preferably has an inlet port 321 to fill the pump and an outlet port 322 in fluid communication with the tubing 304. The elastomeric chamber 318 is preferably constructed from a resilient material which may comprise a variety of elastomeric compositions, well known in the art, including vulcanized synthetic polyisoprenes, natural latex, natural rubber, synthetic rubber or silicone rubber. Fluid is held under pressure within the elastomeric chamber 318 and flows from the elastomeric chamber 318 through an outlet port 322 into the conduit 304 at a controlled and predictable rate. Alternatively, conduit 304 may be sized to serve as a flow restrictor. Exemplary pumps are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,284,481 which is hereby incorporated by reference. A variety of other conventional pumps may be used, so long as they can impart the desired pressure on the fluid. For example, the pumps described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,080,652 and 5,105,983, which are hereby incorporated by reference may also be used, as well as other suitable electronic or mechanical pumps offered by other manufacturers as will be understood by those of skill in the art. An optional clamp 324 is positioned in the flow path 306 downstream from the conduit 304. The clamp 324 can compress the flow path 306 such that fluid flow from the pump 302 is occluded. Such occlusion is advantageous for the transportation and preparation of the fluid delivery device and method as described herein. An exemplary clamp 324 is also described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,350,253, which is hereby incorporated by reference. However, a variety of other conventional clamps known in the industry may be used to occlude the flow of fluid from the pump 302 through the flow path 306 such as compression clamps, C clamps, roller clamps, and the like. An optional filter 326 downstream of the clamp 324 separates the fluid from contaminates and other undesired particles that may be found within the fluid. The filter 326 also preferably eliminates air from the fluid path 306. One such filter 326 is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,350,253, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Other suitable filters recognized in the industry may be used to capture undesired particles and/or remove air from the system. An optional flow regulator 328 is positioned in the continuous flow path 306. The flow regulator 328 sets the continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid from the pump 302 to the patient P via tubing 304. The flow rate may be adjusted to a rate within a range of from about 1 to about 14 cubic centimeters of fluid per hour. Desirably, the flow rate may be from about 1 to about 7 or from about 2 to about 14 cubic centimeters per hour. The flow regulator 328 may be manually adjustable, if desired, and provided with a dial, switch or lever with an adjustable flow rate control display of from about 1 to about 14 cubic centimeters per hour. For example, the flow rate may be from about 1 to about 7 or from about 2 to about 14 cubic centimeters of fluid per hour. Alternatively, a constant flow regulator (i.e., a regulator which is not adjustable) can be employed. For example, an optional first flow regulating orifice such as a first glass orifice tube 360 may be employed in the primary or continuous flow path 306 and/or an optional second flow regulating orifice such as a second glass orifice tube 362 may be employed in the bolus flow path 308 (See FIG. 2). The particular arrangement of the clamp 324, filter 326 and flow regulator 328 (or glass tube 360) herein described is merely exemplary. These elements, if present, may be arranged in any order as will be easily understood by those skilled in the art. Desirably, a first glass tube 360 and a second glass tube 362 are located downstream of the respective filters 326 and 334. The device 300 for dispensing fluid to a patient utilizes at least one indicator assembly 20 including a pre-biased indicator 22 to indicate a flow condition. Desirably, one indicator assembly 20 with its pre-biased indicator is located above the flow regulator 328 (or alternatively the glass tube 360) and one indicator assembly 20 with its pre-biased indicator is located below the flow regulator 328 (or alternatively the glass tube 360). The pre-biased indicator 22 provides a discrete visual signal when the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path 306 has changed from a predetermined level of pressure. Generally speaking, the pressure in the continuous flow path can be associated with a fluid flow state. For example, the pre-biased indicator may be configured to provide a discrete visual signal that the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is less than the predetermined level of pressure. Alternatively, the pre-biased indicator may be configured to provide a discrete visual signal that the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is greater than the predetermined level of pressure. When an indicator assembly with its pre-biased indicator is located between a flow regulator and the pressurized source of fluid and the pre-biased indicator provides a discrete visual signal that the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is less than the predetermined level of pressure, such a signal indicates a flow state that is less than a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid. For example, if an outlet of the pressurized source of fluid becomes clogged, if a filter or bubble trap becomes clogged, a clamp inadvertently becomes closed or is left closed, or if the continuous flow path becomes kinked, pinched or constricted, the pressure of fluid in the continuous flow path downstream of the obstruction will fall. The drop in pressure downstream of the obstruction but upstream from the flow regulator generally corresponds to a reduction in the flow of fluid below a predetermined continuous and substantially constant flow rate. The pre-biased indicator in fluid communication with the continuous flow path responds to the reduction in pressure and provides a signal that is visible to a care provider or a patient. The visual signal is interpreted as a reduction in the flow of fluid below a predetermined continuous and substantially constant flow rate. When an indicator assembly 20 with its pre-biased indicator 22 is located downstream of the flow regulator 328 (or orifice 360) and the pre-biased indicator provides a discrete visual signal that the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is greater than the predetermined level of pressure, such a signal indicates a flow state that is less than a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid. For example, if an outlet of the tubing 304 or connection of the continuous flow path to a catheter 330 becomes clogged, if the catheter 330 itself becomes clogged or if the tubing, continuous flow path or catheter becomes kinked, pinched or constricted, the pressure of fluid will rise in the portion of the continuous flow path downstream of the flow regulator but upstream of an obstruction. The increase in pressure in this portion of the continuous flow path generally corresponds to a reduction in the flow of fluid below a predetermined continuous and substantially constant flow rate. The pre-biased indicator in fluid communication with the continuous flow path responds to the increase in pressure and provides a signal that is visible to a care provider or a patient. The visual signal is interpreted as a reduction in the flow of fluid below a predetermined continuous and substantially constant flow rate. Referring to FIG. 2, a large volume bolus delivery system 310 accumulates a large quantity of fluid from the bolus flow path 308 leading from the reservoir 302, and holds the fluid under pressure until the bolus dose is triggered by a patient operable actuator 312 for release into the patient P. The large volume bolus delivery system 310 is configured to receive fluid the bolus delivery system being configured to elastically expand to pressurize fluid, store the pressurized fluid and dispense the pressurized fluid while avoiding bolus refill during bolus delivery or after bolus delivery but before it is enabled to elastically expand in a subsequent delivery cycle. The actuator 312 is configured such that it does not require effort to force the fluid out of the bolus reservoir and that when actuated by the patient; fluid is permitted to flow out of the bolus reservoir to the patient without further action by the patient. The large volume bolus delivery system 310 is desirably the PCA device described above. Downstream from large volume bolus delivery system 310, the continuous flow path 306 and the bolus dose flow path 308 converge into a single flow path 314 to the patient P. Still referring to FIG. 2, an optional clamp 332 and an optional filter 334 may be positioned in the flow path 308 downstream from the conduit 304. The clamp 332 can compress the flow path 308 such that fluid flow from the pump 302 is occluded. Such occlusion is advantageous for the transportation and preparation of the fluid delivery device and method as described herein. The release-rate of the bolus dose to the patient P is controlled by the decompression of the elastomeric bolus reservoir 310, by the pressure gradient at the valve 312, and the diameter of the catheter 330. Advantageously, the patient P does not have to provide pressure to force fluid out of the large volume bolus delivery system 310 into the narrower bolus flow path 308. Rather, the patient P can turn the stopcock or release the push button to administer the bolus dose. If the patient P activates the bolus valve 312 prior to the time the bolus reservoir 310 has filled to its capacity, the patient P receives less than the full amount of the bolus dose. In effect, this prevents the patient P from self-administering more than the maximum desired amount of fluid per the time specified as a large volume bolus dose. Turning now to FIGS. 3A though 6B, an indicator assembly 20 or “flow indicator” incorporates a pre-biased indicator 22 that provides a discrete visual signal when pressure in a continuous flow path 306 associated with the catheter 330 is different from a predetermined level of pressure. The indicator assembly 20 includes a continuous flow path 306 having walls 32 defining a lumen 34. A base 36 of the assembly is located on a portion of the continuous flow path 306. The base has a first end 42 and a second end 44. The pre-biased indicator 22 is located on the base 36 in fluid communication with the continuous flow path 306. According to the invention, the pre-biased indicator 22 is configured to provide a discrete visual signal that the pressure of a fluid in the continuous flow path has changed from a predetermined level of pressure. The indicator 22 may be located on the second end 44 of the base 36. It is contemplated that the indicator 22 may be located in some other arrangement. The pre-biased indicator 22 is in fluid communication with the continuous flow path 306 through an indicator lumen 50, defined in a portion of the wall 32 of the continuous flow path 306 and defined in portion of the base 36. The indicator lumen 50 extends from the continuous flow path 306 to the indicator 22. Referring to FIG. 4, there is shown in an exploded cross-sectional view, an exemplary pre-biased indicator 22 of the indicator assembly 20. The pre-biased indicator 22 includes a housing 52. The housing 52 may be formed of one-piece. Alternatively, and as shown in FIG. 4, the housing 52 may be composed of multiple sections. For example, the housing 52 may be formed of a lens 54 and a cap 56. Generally speaking, the housing 52 has a first end 58, a second end 60, one or more walls 62 defining an interior channel 64, and an axial dimension “A”. The first end 58 of the housing 52 is in fluid communication with the continuous flow path 306. Desirably, at least a portion of the housing 52 is transparent or translucent. For example, the lens 54 may be transparent or translucent. The pre-biased indicator 22 further includes a flexible sleeve 66 positioned within the interior channel 64 of the housing 52. The flexible sleeve 66 has a first surface 68, an opposed second surface 70, a first end 72 located within the interior channel of the housing, a second end 74 engaged with the housing 52 to create a fluid impervious seal, and a flexible, generally annular portion 76 joining the first end 72 and second end 74 of the sleeve. According to the invention, the flexible, generally annular portion 76 of the flexible sleeve defines a rolling annular fold 78 intermediate the first end 72 and the second end 74 of the sleeve. The rolling annular fold 78 is configured so that at least a portion of the first surface 68 of the flexible sleeve is generally adjacent the one or more housing walls 62 and at least a portion of the second surface 70 of the flexible sleeve defines a sleeve cavity 80. Generally speaking, the rolling annular fold 78 travels or moves as the first end 72 of the sleeve 66 travels along the axial direction or dimension “A” of the housing 52. That is, movement of the first end 72 of the flexible sleeve 66 along an axial direction “A” causes a portion of the second surface 70 of the flexible sleeve to evert at the rolling annular fold 78 so that it becomes directly adjacent the one or more housing walls 62. The pre-biased indicator 22 also includes a biasing element 82 located at least partially within the sleeve cavity 80 and between the first end 58 of the housing and the second end 60 of the housing. The biasing element 82 is configured to deform at a predetermined pressure or force so the flexible sleeve 72 moves from a first axial position to at least a second axial position. The pressure or force is applied against the first end 72 of the flexible sleeve 66. The first end 72 is in fluid communication with the continuous flow path through an indicator lumen. A detail of this movement of the flexible sleeve is illustrated in cross-sectional view by FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B. FIG. 5A illustrates a cross section of a flexible sleeve 66 showing the biasing element 82 located at least partially within the sleeve cavity 80 defined by the flexible annular portion 76 prior to deformation of the biasing element. In this configuration, the first end 72 of the flexible sleeve 66 is at a first axial position “P”. The second end 74 of the flexible sleeve 66 is near the rolling annular fold 78 and is relatively distant from the first end 72 of the sleeve 66. FIG. 5B illustrates a cross section of a flexible sleeve 72 showing the biasing element 82 located at least partially within the sleeve cavity 80 defined by the flexible annular portion 76 after deformation of the biasing element. In this configuration, the first end 72 of the flexible sleeve 66 is at a second axial position “D”. The second end 74 of the flexible sleeve 66 is relatively further away from the rolling annular fold 78 and is relatively nearer to the first end 72 of the sleeve 66. The deformation of the biasing element causes the flexible sleeve to move from its first axial position “P” to its second axial position “D”. The result of this movement from a first axial position to a second axial position is illustrated in perspective view by FIGS. 6A and 6B. FIG. 6A illustrates an indicator assembly 20 incorporating a pre-biased indicator 22. In this illustration, the biasing element is deformed due to pressure in the continuous flow path 306 so the flexible sleeve is not visible in the pre-biased indicator 22. More particularly, the flexible sleeve 66 is in the second axial position “D” as generally illustrated in FIG. 5B. The cap 56, the flexible sleeve 66 and the biasing element 82 are sized so that the flexible sleeve 66 is not visible through the cap 56, which desirably is opaque, when the flexible sleeve is in the second axial position “D”. This movement of the flexible sleeve to the second axial position “D” where it is not readily visible provides a very simple and reliable indication to a user that the pressure of fluid in the continuous flow path is different from (i.e., above) a predetermined level of pressure. Since the flexible sleeve 66 is impermeable and is engaged with the housing 52 to form a seal, a vent means 96 to maintain atmospheric pressure in the sleeve cavity 80 defined by the flexible annular portion 76 of the flexible sleeve is located at the second end of the housing 60. The vent means 96 may be a hole, a plurality of holes, a slit, a plurality of slits, a highly porous, spongy region or the like. The vent means 96 allows passage of air into and out of the sleeve cavity 80 defined by the second surface 70 of the flexible sleeve at the flexible annular portion 76 located in the interior channel 64 of the housing 52. The passage of air through the vent means 96 is in response to the axial movement of the flexible sleeve. In an aspect of the invention, the flexible sleeve may include a plate 90 joined to a plug 92 that is adapted to fit into a socket 94 formed in the first end 72 of the flexible sleeve. This plate and the associated plug and socket may be used to provide some dimensional stability to the first end 72 of the flexible sleeve which is in fluid communication with the continuous flow path and which receives pressure that is communicated to the biasing element. The plate 90 may also be configured to have the same color as the material at the second end 60 of the housing 52 (e.g., the cap 56 if a two piece housing is used) so that, when the biasing element is deformed and the flexible sleeve is at its second axial position “D”, the material forming the first end 72 of the flexible sleeve is not readily visible because it is hidden beneath the plate 90 and blends in with the second end 60 of the housing 52 so that a user does not misinterpret the position of the sleeve based on the visible presence of the color of the material forming the flexible sleeve. Referring now to FIG. 6B, there is illustrated an indicator assembly 20 incorporating a pre-biased indicator 22 in a different configuration. In this illustration, the biasing element 82 of the pre-biased indicator 22 is no long deformed due to pressure in the continuous flow path 306. In this configuration, the flexible sleeve is visible through the housing and provides a simple, easy to interpret signal. More particularly, the flexible sleeve 66 is in the first axial position “P” as generally illustrated in FIG. 5A. If the housing 52 is composed of two or more pieces such as, for example, a lens 54 and a cap 56, these components and the flexible sleeve 66 and the biasing element 82 are sized so that the flexible sleeve 66 is visible through the lens 54, which desirably is transparent or translucent, when the fluid pressure in the continuous flow path falls below a predetermined level and the biasing element 82 expands to urge the first end 72 of flexible sleeve 66 back along the interior channel 64 to the first end 58 of the housing 52. In other words, when the fluid pressure in the continuous flow path falls below the predetermined pressure of the biasing element, the biasing element pushes the flexible sleeve back into the first axial position where a user can see the flexible sleeve and readily understand the signal that the pressure in the continuous flow path has fallen below the predetermined level. This movement of the flexible sleeve to the first axial position “P” where it is readily visible provides a very simple and reliable indication to a user that the pressure of fluid in the continuous flow path is different from (i.e., below) a predetermined level of pressure. During normal use of an indicator assembly, pressurized fluid from the pump or reservoir 302 enters the conduit 304 and into the continuous or primary flow path 306. A regulator, which may be an adjustable regulator 328 or a non-adjustable flow regulating orifice 360, is used to control the flow of fluid. A fluid pressure exists within the continuous flow path and is associated with flow of fluid at a particular flow rate. A first indicator assembly is located above the regulator. The indicator assembly has a pre-biased indicator that responds to a predetermined level of pressure in the continuous flow path. The predetermined level of pressure is a pressure in a range with a lower limit at the lower limit of the continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid (e.g., liquid drug) through of the continuous flow path. The biasing element 82 of the pre-biased indicator deforms when the force (i.e., fluid pressure) against the first end 72 of the flexible sleeve communicated from the continuous flow path through the indicator lumen reaches the predetermined level of pressure at which the biasing element deforms. Generally speaking, the pre-biased indicator upstream of the regulator is set to deform so the flexible sleeve is at the second axial position “D” during normal use and at the first axial position “P” when the pressure upstream of the regulator drops below the predetermined level of pressure. The pre-biased indicator downstream of the regulator where pressure in the continuous flow path is much lower (and may be near atmospheric pressure) is set so the flexible sleeve is at the first axial position “P” during normal use and is configured to deform to the second axial position “D” when the pressure downstream of the regulator rises above a predetermined level of pressure for that section of the continuous flow path. The flexible sleeve is desirably made of a soft, flexible material. Exemplary materials include, but are not limited to, polyurethane, silicone and other materials that are resilient. Desirably, the material has a memory of its shape. Suitable materials include, but are not limited to, “soft” or elastomeric medical grade silicone polymers and “soft” or elastomeric medical grade polyurethane polymers. The “soft” polymers may have a Shore A Hardness of between about 20 and about 60, more desirably between about 30 and about 50. The Shore Hardness testing of soft plastics is most commonly measured by the Shore (Durometer) test using either the Shore A or Shore D scale. The Shore A scale is used for “softer” rubbers while the Shore D scale is used for “harder” ones. The Shore A Hardness is the relative hardness of elastic materials such as rubber or soft plastics can be determined with an instrument called a Shore A Durometer. If the indenter completely penetrates the sample, a reading of 0 is obtained, and if no penetration occurs, a reading of 100 results. The reading is dimensionless. The Shore hardness is measured with an apparatus known as a Durometer and is sometimes also referred to as Durometer Hardness. The hardness value is determined by the penetration of the Durometer indenter foot into the sample. Because of the resilience of rubbers and plastics, the hardness reading may change over time so the indentation time is sometimes reported along with the hardness number. The ASTM test number is ASTM D2240 while the analogous ISO test method is ISO 868. The flexible sleeve may have a color or pigment integrated into the material forming the sleeve. Alternatively and/or additionally, the flexible sleeve may have a coating or layer of color on the exterior of the sleeve or on the interior of the sleeve. For example, the flexible sleeve may incorporate or be coated with a generally bright, fluorescent color that is readily visible and easy to identify. Examples of these colors include, but are not limited to, yellow, orange, blue, green, red, purple and various intensities and combinations thereof. In an embodiment of the invention, the flexible sleeve may have a first color such as, for example, green, appearing at its second surface 70 and a second color such as, for example, red, appearing at its first surface 68. The housing 52 may be transparent such that when the flexible sleeve is at the second axial position “D”, the flexible sleeve everts at the rolling annular fold 78 such that the color of the second surface 70 (e.g., green) is primarily visible and the color of the first surface 68 (e.g., red) is minimally visible or not visible. This movement of the flexible sleeve to the second axial position “D” where the color of the second surface 70 (e.g., green) is primarily visible and the color of the first surface 68 (e.g., red) is minimally visible or not visible provides a very simple and reliable indication to a user that the pressure of fluid in the continuous flow path is different from (i.e., above) a predetermined level of pressure. Alternatively and/or additionally, the movement of the flexible sleeve to the second axial position “D” where the color of the second surface 70 (e.g., green) is primarily visible and the color of the first surface 68 (e.g., red) is minimally visible or not visible provides a very simple and reliable indication to a user that the volume of the continuous flow path is at or greater than a predetermined fill volume. In such an embodiment, the housing 52 may be transparent such that when the flexible sleeve is at the first axial position “P”, the flexible sleeve everts at the rolling annular fold 78 such that the color of the second surface 70 (e.g., green) is minimally visible or not visible and the color of the first surface 68 (e.g., red) is primarily visible. This movement of the flexible sleeve to the first axial position “P” where the color of the second surface 70 (e.g., green) is minimally visible or not visible and the color of the first surface 68 (e.g., red) is primarily visible provides a very simple and reliable indication to a user that the pressure of fluid in the continuous flow path is different from (i.e., below) a predetermined level of pressure. Alternatively and/or additionally, the movement of the flexible sleeve to the first axial position “P” where the color of the second surface 70 (e.g., green) is minimally visible or not visible and the color of the first surface 68 (e.g., red) is primarily visible provides a very simple and reliable indication to a user that the volume of the continuous flow path is below or less than a predetermined fill volume. According to an aspect of the invention, the flexible sleeve 66 and the other components of the pre-biased indicator 22 may be sized to appropriately fit with the head 36 of the indicator assembly 20. For example, the flexible sleeve 66 may have a length from the first end 72 to the furthest outward extent of the rolling annular fold 78 towards the second end 60 of the housing 52 that may range from about 6 mm to about 12 mm. As another example, the indicator sleeve may have a length from the first end 72 to the furthest extent of the rolling annular fold 78 of from about 7 mm to about 11 mm. As yet another example, the indicator sleeve may have a length from the first end 72 to the furthest extent of the rolling annular fold 78 of from about 8 mm to about 10 mm. The diameter of the flexible sleeve may be from about 2 mm to about 10 mm. For example, the diameter of the flexible sleeve may be from about 3 mm to about 9 mm. As another example, the diameter of the flexible sleeve may be from about 4 mm to about 6 mm. While the diameter implies a circular cross-section, other cross-sectional geometries are contemplated. For example, the flexible sleeve may have an elliptical cross-section, oval cross section or even a hexagonal cross-section, an octagonal cross-section or the like provided such cross-sectional geometries do not interfere with the movement of the rolling annular fold or rolling annular-like fold in the case of non-circular geometries. For purposes of the present invention, the term rolling annular fold encompasses rolling annular-like folds that are based on non-circular geometries to the extent that such geometries allow the rolling fold to evert the flexible sleeve and function as described above. In an aspect of the invention, the diameter of the flexible sleeve need not be uniform. For example, the diameter of the flexible sleeve may be smaller at the first end 72 of the flexible sleeve and larger towards the second end 74 of the flexible sleeve closer to the rolling annular fold 78 provided such a change in diameter does not interfere with the function of the rolling annular fold. Other non-uniformities of the flexible sleeve are contemplated provided they do not interfere with the operation of the sleeve and the rolling annular fold. The flexible sleeve may be configured to travel between about 3 to about 10 mm. That is, the displacement of the first end 72 of the flexible sleeve from its first axial position “P” to its second axial position “D” may range from about 3 to about 10 mm. The larger distance provides greater visibility of the flexible sleeve and a more noticeable signal. The smaller distance provides for an even more compact pre-biased indicator. For example, the displacement of the first end 72 of the flexible sleeve from its first axial position “P” to its second axial position “D” may range from about 4 to about 7 mm. As another example, the displacement of the first end 72 of the flexible sleeve from its first axial position “P” to its second axial position “D” may range from about 4 to about 5 mm. The biasing element 82 is desirably a spring such as, for example, a coil compression spring. It is contemplated that other resilient constructions could be used as the biasing element. These include flexible, resilient foams, metal strips, volute or secateur springs, conical springs and the like. Descriptions of conical springs may be found at, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,111,407 for “Conical Compression Spring”. Generally speaking, the biasing element 82 is desirably a coil compression spring that may be characterized as having linear movement and a spring rate designed such that the spring rapidly deforms over a very small range of pressure to provide a very discrete signal that the pressure of a fluid in the continuous flow path is different from the predetermined pressure of the spring. The biasing element may desirably be sized so that it approaches full compression or solid compression (including any allowance for coil clash or similar property for other resilient structures) at a point at or just beyond which the flexible sleeve reaches its second axial position “D”. Desirably, the biasing element is sized so that it approaches solid compression or full compression at a point which allows the flexible sleeve to compress sufficiently so it reaches its second axial position “D” and become hidden from view in the second end 60 of the housing 52 while providing a column of support for the flexible sleeve 66 so that the travel of the flexible sleeve much beyond the second axial position “D” is limited. This characteristic serves to prevent the flexible sleeve from extending far enough to the second end 60 of the housing to totally evert or flip inside-out and eliminate the rolling annular fold 78. If the rolling annular fold is eliminated, the indicator may fail to function properly and may fail to allow travel of the flexible sleeve 66 back to its first axial position “P” in response to pressure of fluid in the continuous flow path that is lower than the predetermined level of pressure of the biasing element because the inverted flexible sleeve may provide sufficient resistance to the biasing element to keep it from reforming or reconstituting the rolling annular fold. By providing sufficient structure to maintain the rolling annular fold 78, the biasing element allows ease of motion in both directions between the first axial position “P” and the second axial position “D” so the flexible sleeve can rapidly respond if the pressure of fluid in the continuous flow path deviates from the predetermined level of pressure of the biasing element. In an aspect of the invention, the biasing element is desirably configured so that the change in axial position of the flexible sleeve that generates the discrete visual signal occurs over a relatively small change in the pressure of the fluid in the balloon. For example, the change in pressure sufficient to effect the change in axial position of the flexible sleeve may be between about 0.1 pounds per square inch and about 0.75 pound per square inch. As another example, the change in pressure sufficient to effect the change in axial position of the flexible sleeve may be between about 0.25 pounds per square inch and about 0.6 pound per square inch. As yet another example, the change in pressure sufficient to effect the change in axial position of the flexible sleeve may be about 0.5 pounds per square inch (approximately 3.5 kilopascals). This change in pressure is a change in relative pressure and represents a change in pressure relative to the surrounding ambient or atmospheric pressure. Desirably, the spring rate of the biasing element is a linear spring rate and is expressed in terms of pounds-force per linear inch (lbs-force/inch). That is, the spring rate is the load, expressed in pounds-force, required to deflect (i.e., compress or expand) the spring by a distance of one inch. For example, if the spring rate is forty (40) lbs-force/inch, it would take ten (10) lbs-force to deflect (i.e., compress or expand) the spring 0.25 inch and it would take eighty (80) lbs-force to deflect (i.e., compress or expand) the spring two (2) inches. One (1) lb-force/inch is about 1.8 newtons/cm. According to the invention, the spring rate may range from about 0.1 lbs-force/inch to about 1.0 lbs-force/inch (about 0.4 newtons/inch to about 4.5 newtons/inch or about 0.1 newtons/cm to about 1.8 newtons/cm). Desirably, the spring rate may range from about 0.13 lbs-force/inch to about 0.60 lbs-force/inch. More desirably, the spring rate may range from about 0.2 lbs-force/inch to about 0.45 lbs-force/inch. Even more desirably, the spring rate may range from about 0.25 lbs-force/inch to about 0.35 lbs-force/inch. For example, the spring rate may be about 0.3 lbs-force/inch. Generally speaking, the flexible sleeve 66 should have sufficient softness that it does not meaningfully interfere with the spring rate. For example, the flexible sleeve may have a flexible, generally annular portion in which the thickness of the walls in that portion range from about 5 to about 30 mils (i.e., about 5 to about 30 thousandths of an inch or about 127 micrometers to about 760 micrometers). As another example, the thickness of the walls may range from about 10 to about 20 mils (i.e., about 250 micrometers to about 510 micrometers). As yet another example, the thickness of the walls may range from about 15 to about 20 mils (i.e., about 380 micrometers to about 510 micrometers). This thickness may be determined by conventional techniques using a digital contact device such as, for example a Mitutoyo Litematic Digimatic Measuring Unit in accordance with the appropriate standardized tests. In an aspect of the invention, it is contemplated that the thickness of the flexible sleeve may be selected to meaningfully complement the resistance of the biasing element to deformation to provide a combined predetermined pressure of deformation for the combination of the two components. An important feature of the present invention is that it provides a discrete visual signal that the pressure of a fluid in a continuous flow path is different from a predetermined level of pressure. Generally speaking, this is accomplished by having the biasing element selected to provide sufficient movement (e.g., linearly along the axial dimension of the housing) and responsiveness to pressure (e.g., a low spring rate) such that the biasing element rapidly deforms over a very small range of pressure change to provide a discrete, distinct signal that the pressure of a fluid in the continuous flow path is different from the predetermined pressure of the biasing element. Such a discrete visual signal may be characterized as a “binary” signal. That is, the pressure is either greater than (or equal to) the predetermined level of pressure which provides one output from the pre-biased indicator or the pressure is lower than the predetermined level of pressure which provides a different output from the pre-biased indicator. This response is much easier to interpret than the relative fluid levels of manometers and/or other indicators that provide an uninterrupted reading or display of the different levels of pressure of a fluid in a continuous flow path. Such a simple and easy to interpret indicator is described as “pre-biased” because it is configured to change its indicator display or signal in response to fluid pressure crossing a predetermined threshold pressure. This configuration is enabled by the use of a continuous flow path having a pressure within a generally predictable range at a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid such that a pre-biased indicator can be set to a predetermined pressure. Generally speaking, a predetermined pressure is a pressure in a range with a lower limit at the lowest pressure associated with the lowest acceptable level of continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid in the continuous flow path. An aspect of the present invention encompasses an assembly for indicating a fluid flow state in a medical device for dispensing a fluid under pressure to a patient through a continuous flow path at a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid. The indicator assembly includes an indicator that provides only a first discrete visual signal when the pressure in the continuous flow path is at its predetermined pressure and a second discrete visual signal when the pressure in the continuous flow path is no longer under pressure. Desirably, the indicator provides such first and second discrete visual signals with no signal of other states therebetween. That is, the indicator provides a signal of only two states of the continuous flow path—that it is at its predetermined pressure and that the continuous flow path is no longer at its predetermined pressure. The general structure of an exemplary indicator is described above and is illustrated at, for example, in FIGS. 3A, 3B, 4, 5A, 5B, 6A and 6B. The present invention also encompasses a system for dispensing fluid to a patient and indicating a fluid flow condition. The system includes: a reservoir for providing a source of fluid under pressure; a continuous flow path in fluid communication with the source of fluid for providing a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid from the source; and at least one pre-biased indicator in fluid communication with the continuous flow path, such that the at least one pre-biased indicator provides a discrete visual signal when the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is different from a predetermined level of pressure, thereby indicating a fluid flow condition. The system may further include a flow regulator and a pre-biased indicator may be located between the flow regulator and the source of fluid such that the pre-biased indicator provides a discrete visual signal when the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is less than the predetermined level of pressure and such a discrete visual signal indicates a flow state that is less than a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid. Alternatively and/or additionally, the system may include a flow regulator and a pre-biased indicator may be located in a direction downstream of a flow regulator such that the pre-biased indicator provides a discrete visual signal when the pressure of the fluid in the continuous flow path is greater than the predetermined level of pressure and such a signal indicates a flow state that is less than a continuous and substantially constant flow rate of fluid.

The device of claim 17, wherein the movement of the flexible sleeve in an axial direction causes a portion of the second surface of the flexible sleeve to evert at the rolling annular fold so that it becomes directly adjacent the one or more housing walls. 19. The device of claim 14, wherein the at least one pre-biased indicator provides a first discrete visual signal when the pressure of the fluid in the flow path is at a predetermined pressure and a second discrete visual signal when the pressure of the fluid in the flow path is no longer at the predetermined pressure. 20. The device of claim 19, wherein the at least one pre-biased indicator provides no signal of other pressure states between the first discrete visual signal and the second discrete visual signal.
