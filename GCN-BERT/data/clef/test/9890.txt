BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION One type of the naturally occurring compounds with broad therapeutic applications is quinone. Quinone compounds widely exist in microorganisms, plants and animals (Thomson R H Naturally Occurring Quinones IV: Recent Advances. Published by Springer, 1996). Quinone compounds are redox capable and exist in vivo in one or several chemical species. Coenzyme Q10 is one of a few quinone compounds with fully identified chemical species profile in vivo (Bhagavan H N, et al. Mitochondrion, 2007, 7S: S78-88). The circulating coenzyme Q10 in human is almost entirely in the form of hydroquinone and the conversion to hydroquinone of the orally administered ubiquinone (oxidized form of coenzyme Q10) occurs in the enterocytes prior to its lymphatic transport into circulation (Craft N E, et al. FASEB J. 2005, 19, A449; Bhagavan H N, et al. Int. J. Pharmaceut. 2007, 333: 112-117; Mohr D, et al. Redox Rep. 1999, 4: 79-87). Approved anticancer quinone compounds include daunorubicin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, valrubicin, and mitomycin. Their anticancer activity is mainly attributed to their ability to inhibit DNA replication in cancer cells by directly damaging DNA or interacting with proteins involved in DNA replication. Naphthofuran quinones have also a variety of biological activities. Some of them have been shown to have anticancer and other activities. For example, several natural occurring naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones with interesting biological activities have been isolated from plants (Rao M M, et al. J. Natural Products, 1982, 45: 600-604; Tisler M, “Heterocyclic Quinones in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry” Vol. 45, ed. Katritzky A R, Academic Press, London, 1989, 56-63), and their analogs have further been found to have cytotoxic activity (Ogawa M, et al. Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry, 2006, 70: 1009-1012; US20060142271; WO2009036059; WO2009036099; WO2009036101). As cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 13% of all deaths according to 2004 World Health Organization statistics, there remains a need for novel compounds as active pharmaceutical ingredient useful for more effective treatment of cancer. SUMMARY The present invention provides novel compounds as active pharmaceutical ingredients for more effective treatment of cancer and other diseases, disorders and conditions. Among other things, the present invention provides a compound of formula I: or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and n is as defined and described herein. In addition, the present invention relates to conversion of the esters into therapeutically active 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furans in vivo. Further, the present invention relates to therapeutic activity of 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furans mainly attributing to their ability to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds described herein and use of the said compounds and compositions in the treatment of various diseases, disorders, and conditions. Even furthermore, the present invention relates to amorphous solids of esters of 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furans or naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones as component of pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of various indications including proliferative diseases.

As used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount” means an amount of a substance (e.g., a therapeutic agent, composition, and/or formulation) that elicits a desired biological response when administered as part of a therapeutic regimen. In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of a substance is an amount that is sufficient, when administered to a subject suffering from or susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition, to treat the disease, disorder, and/or condition. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in this art, the effective amount of a substance may vary depending on such factors as the desired biological endpoint, the substance to be delivered, the target cell or tissue, etc. For example, the effective amount of compound in a formulation to treat a disease, disorder, and/or condition is the amount that alleviates, ameliorates, relieves, inhibits, prevents, delays onset of, reduces severity of and/or reduces incidence of one or more symptoms or features of the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount is administered in a single dose; in some embodiments, multiple unit doses are required to deliver a therapeutically effective amount. As used herein, the term “treat,” “treatment,” or “treating” refers to any method used to partially or completely alleviate, ameliorate, relieve, inhibit, prevent, delay onset of, reduce severity of and/or reduce incidence of one or more symptoms or features of a disease, disorder, and/or condition. Treatment may be administered to a subject who does not exhibit signs of a disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, treatment may be administered to a subject who exhibits only early signs of the disease, disorder, and/or condition for the purpose of decreasing the risk of developing pathology associated with the disease, disorder, and/or condition. The expression “unit dose” as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of a formulation appropriate for a subject to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of a formulation of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific effective dose level for any particular subject or organism may depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; activity of specific active compound employed; specific composition employed; age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject; time of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific active compound employed; duration of the treatment; drugs and/or additional therapies used in combination or coincidental with specific compound(s) employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts. A particular unit dose may or may not contain a therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic agent. An individual who is “suffering from” a disease, disorder, and/or condition has been diagnosed with and/or displays one or more symptoms of the disease, disorder, and/or condition. An individual who is “susceptible to” a disease, disorder, and/or condition has not been diagnosed with the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, an individual who is susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition may exhibit symptoms of the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, an individual who is susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition may not exhibit symptoms of the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, an individual who is susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition will develop the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, an individual who is susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition will not develop the disease, disorder, and/or condition.

Synthesis There are numerous reports about synthesis of naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones (J. of Natural Products, 1982, 45: 600-604; Heterocycles, 1999, 51: 497-500; US 2006/0142271; WO 2009036059; Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry, 2006, 70: 1009-1012; J. Chem. Soc., 1971, C: 153; Tetrahedron, 1974, 30: 3193; An. Acad. Bras. Cienc., 1990, 62: 329; J. Hererocyclic Chem., 1994, 31: 1303-1304; Canadian Journal of Chemistry, 1974, 52: 88-94; Synthesis, 1979, 3: 188-189; Chemistry Letters, 1988, 8: 1415-1418; British Journal of Haematology, 2005, 131: 520-529). When the substituent group at position 2 is, for example, alkylcarbonyl or arylcarbonyl, synthesis of naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones can be carried out as reported (Heterocycles, 1999, 51: 497-500) which is shown in scheme 1. wherein DBU is 1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, THF is tetrahydrofuran, and R1, R4, Rc, and n are as defined and described herein. The method shown in scheme 1 has been modified to facilitate large scale preparation and to avoid undesired byproduct naphtho[2,3-b]dihydrofuran-4,9-diones. The modified method is described as scheme 2. wherein DMF is N,N-dimethylformamide, TEA is triethylamine, DBU and THF are described in scheme 1, and R1, R4, Rc, and n are as defined and described herein. In scheme 2, use of high boiling point solvent is favorable in large scale preparation in open air for safety consideration. In some embodiments, the high boiling solvent has a boiling point greater than 100° C. In certain embodiments, the solvent is N,N-dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulfoxide. In some embodiments, the solvent is not toluene. As shown in scheme 2, a naphthodihydrofurandione (e.g., 2-alkylcarbonyl-naphtho[2,3-b]dihydrofuran-4,9-dione) was also prepared and purified in satisfactory yield, and was converted into a naphthofurandione (e.g., 2-alkylcarbonyl-naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-dione) with quantitative yield using a suitable base in open air. In some embodiments, the suitable base is a tertiary amine. In some embodiments, the suitable base is DBU. In some embodiments, the suitable base is TEA. This elucidates the mechanism of the final reaction step shown in scheme 1 and helps to eliminate the undesired dihydrofuran byproduct in the one pot synthesis by adding extra base such DBU or TEA. Exemplary naphotho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-dione compounds are set forth in Table 2 below. TABLE 2 compound XI compound XII compound XIII compound XIV compound XV compound XVI Synthesis of the compounds listed in Table 2 is described in the exemplification section. Among all compounds listed in Table 2, only compound XIII and XIV are synthesized as described in Scheme 2. When either R2 or R3 or both of them are —C(═O)Rc, synthesis of the compound of formula I is carried out as described in scheme 3 using a naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-dione or a derivative of a 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furan as one of starting materials. wherein TEA is triethylamine; HBTU is N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-O-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)uronium hexafluorophosphate; DMF is as defined in scheme 2. When either R2 or R3 or both of them are —P(═O)ORaORb, synthesis of the compound of formula I is carried out as described in scheme 4 using a naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-dione or a derivative of a 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furan as one of starting materials. wherein MSNT is 1-(2-Mesitylenesulfonyl)-3-nitro-1H-1,2,4-triazole; acyl chloride is pivaloyl chloride. When either R2 or R3 or both of them are —S(═O)2ORa, synthesis of the compound of formula I is carried out as described in scheme 5 using a naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-dione or a derivative of a 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furan as one of starting materials. wherein DCCI is dicyclohexyl carbodiimide; TEA and DMF are as defined in scheme 3. The Therapeutically Active Chemical Species In vivo Naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones are readily reduced by sodium hydrosulfite (Koyanagi J, et al. J. Heterocyclic Chem. 1997, 34: 407-412; and our unpublished data). A DMSO solution of compound XI, XIII, XV, or XVI was mixed with excessive sodium hydrosulfite aqueous solution. Analysis of each mixture with HPLC showed that the reduced 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furan product is varied in stability. In the HPLC chromatographys shown in FIG. 1, there are bumpy areas between the peaks of 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furans and the peaks of naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones except for the one from compound XI mixture. The bumpy areas indicate oxidation of 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furans by oxygen into corresponding naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones during the HPLC resolving process. Either in vivo or in vitro, compounds of formula I can be degraded by esterases or other proteins or some nucleophilic small molecules into 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furans. However, as demonstrated in the sodium hydrosulfite reduction reaction (FIG. 1), 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furans can be oxidized by oxygen into corresponding naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones. Scheme 6 below showed chemical conversion of a compound of formula I in in vitro biological fluid such as human plasma. The compounds of formula I were incubated in human plasma at 37° C. for 2 hours, and then the mixtures were treated with acetonitrile to remove protein and the resulting supernatants were analyzed by HPLC (FIG. 2). For the incubation of 2-acetyl-4,9-bis(acetoxy)-naphtho[2,3-b]furan, the only detectable product was compound XIII; for compound I and IV, the detectable products were compound XIII and partially degraded products. However, compound II is barely degraded under the same conditions due to stereo hindrance (data not shown here). Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, it is believed that, although not detected due to instability in a protein-free environment, the direct hydrolysis product of a compound of formula I, 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furan, and its partially oxidized product semihydroquinone (shown in scheme 6) co-exist in vivo and play important biological roles. First, quinone compounds are redox capable and can exist in vivo as several chemical species. Coenzyme Q10 is one of a few quinone compounds with fully identified chemical species profile in vivo (Bhagavan H N, et al. Mitochondrion, 200, 7S: S78-S88). The circulating coenzyme Q10 in a human is almost entirely in the form of hydroquinone (or quinol) (Craft N E, et al. FASEB J. 2005, 19, A449; Bhagavan H N, et al. Int. J. Pharmaceut. 2007, 333: 112-117; Mohr D, et al. Redox Rep. 1999, 4: 79-87). Some other quinone compounds, like Mitomycin C, E09, and AZQ, are converted in vivo by a reaction catalyzed by NQ01 (or DT-diaphorase) into their corresponding hydroquinones where their alkylation function groups are activated and thus they act against cancer cells (Danson S, et al. Cancer Treatment Review, 2004, 30: 437-449). β-lapachone, the naturally occurring naphthoquinone, acts against cancer cells with assistance from NQ01 in the cancer cells (Pink J J, et al. The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2000, 275:5416-5424; Bey E A, et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2007, 104:11832-11837). In cancer cells, β-lapachone undergoes the intracellular NQ01 catalyzed futile redox cycles during which the harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) is generated and thus kills the cancer cells. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the reduced forms of the anticancer agents, Mitomycin C, E09, AZQ, and β-lapachone, are the therapeutically active chemical species. Like other quinone compounds mentioned above, naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones are also chemically active in vivo and are good substrates of the reduction enzymes such as NQ01, cytochrome b5 and P450 reductase (unpublished observation). However, there is no report which discusses either the general relationship between their chemical conversions and their biological activities or even only the chemical conversion in vivo. Second, a major metabolite found after incubation of compound I, III, IV, VI or XIII in biological fluid, such as human whole blood, or cancer cell lysate, or liver microsomes, or mouse oral uptake system, is compound XII (FIG. 3). Similarly, a major metabolite found after incubation of compound V, VII or XIV in biological fluid is 2-(1-hydroxy-n-propyl)-naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-dione (data not shown). Reduction of the position 2 substituent carbonyl group is part of quinone redox reaction as evidenced by the β-lapachone effect on the formation of compound XII in the compound XIII incubation mixture of human whole blood (part D of FIG. 3). The possible reaction mechanism is proposed as shown in scheme 7, in which the two electron reduction could be NQ01 catalyzed reduction or two successive cytochrome b5 reductase or p450 reductase catalyzed reaction. As substrate of these enzymes, β-lapachone could compete for the two electron or single electron reaction and thus reduced formation of the metabolism product. Third, NQ01 plays an important role in biological activity of naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones (FIG. 4). NQ01 catalyzes obligatory two-electron reduction of quinone and is an important detoxifying enzyme (Riley R J, et al. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992, 43: 1657-1669; Ross D, et al. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1993, 12: 83-101). NQ01 enzymetic activity can be specifically inhibited by dicumarol (Traver R D, et al. British Journal of Cancer, 1997, 75: 69-75). As shown in FIG. 4, dicumarol attenuates anticancer activities of 2-acetyl-4,9-diacetoxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furan and compound XIII when the treated cancer cells (for example, DLD1) have significant NQ01 enzymatic activity. In opposite, dicumarol showed little effect when the treated cancer cells (for example, Panc-1) have no significant NQ01 enzymatic activity. Similar dicumarol effect was observed on anticancer activity of the compounds of formula I and other naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones (data not shown). Fourth, the compounds of formula I, their analogs and naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones generate significant ROS in cancer cells as shown in FIG. 5. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a general name of the chemical species of the incompletely reduced oxygen. ROS include superoxide anion radical, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical. ROS may have broad therapeutic applications, especially on cancer (Trachootham D, et al. Antioxidants & Redox Signaling, 2008, 10: 1343-1374; Fruehauf J P, et al. Clin Cancer Res 2007, 13: 789-794; Pelicano H, et al. Drug Resist Update 2004, 7: 97-110; Huang P, et al. Nature 2000, 407: 390-395; Trachootham D, et al. Nature Review 2009, 8: 579-591). Under physiologic conditions, cells maintain redox homeostasis by controlling the proper balance between ROS generation and elimination. However, when the increase of ROS reaches a certain level, it may overwhelm the cellular antioxidant capacity and trigger the cell-death process. Therefore, cancer cells with higher basal ROS generation would be more dependent on the antioxidant system and more vulnerable to further oxidative stress-inducing agents. A further increase of ROS stress by using exogenous ROS-generating agents may preferentially increase ROS above the threshold level in cancer cells, leading to cell death. In the dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) pretreated cancer cells, further treatment with fractional micromole of a compound of formula I or naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-dione for less than 30 minutes has similar effect to the treatment of 100 μM of hydrogen peroxide (FIG. 5). Fifth, n-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) blocks anticancer activities of naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones as shown in FIG. 6. NAC is one of effective ROS scavengers, reduces or blocks ROS induced cytotoxicity. The reaction possibility between NAC and compound XIII in culture medium had been ruled out by HPLC analysis. Finally, compound XIII shows fast cytotoxicity to the cancer cell lines with high NQ01 activity but not the cancer cell lines without NQ01 activity as shown in FIG. 7. Fast cytotoxicity means the damage caused by drug to cancer cell line in short time which is counted by hours, and the damage is sufficient to cause cell death in later time. ROS induced cytotoxicity is the typical fast cytotoxicity. DLD1 and A549 cell lines have significant NQ01 activity as shown in part A of FIG. 4, full time treatment or 4 hour treatment with compound XIII made no significant difference in cell growth inhibition. On the contrary, H1299 and Panc 1 cell lines have no NQ01 activity as shown in part A of FIG. 4, full time treatment with compound XIII caused much higher cell growth inhibition than 4 hour treatment. 4,9-Dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furans are unstable in protein free environment under aerobic condition, but exist in biological fluid and play important roles in the biological activity of the compounds of formula I and naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones, as evidenced by: (1) redox reactions in vivo are common chemical properties among quinone and hydroquinone compounds and hydroquinones play important biological roles; (2) reduction of position 2 substituent carbonyl group to hydroxyalkyl group in compound I, III-VII, XIII and XIV is linked to quinone redox reaction, the precursor of the metabolite with position 2 substituent hydroxyalkyl group is likely 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furan; (3) NQ01 catalyzes formation of 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furan in chemistry and plays important role on biological activity of the compounds of formula I, their analogs and naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones; (4) the compounds of formula I, their analogs and naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones generate significant ROS in cancer cells; and (5) NAC effect and fast cytotoxicity confirm ROS role on biological activity of the compounds of formula I, their analogs and naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones. Scheme 8 reasonably links NQ01, ROS generation and ROS biological roles together. The naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-dione or the compound of formula I is reduced or hydrolyzed into therapeutically active hydroquinone (quinol), 4,9-dihydroxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furan. The therapeutically active quinol reduces oxygen to superoxide anion, and quinol itself is oxidized to semihydroquinone (semi-quinone) which reduces another oxygen molecule to superoxide anion, and the semi-quinone itself oxidized back to naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-dione (quinone). The ROS generated by the NQ01 catalyzed futile redox cycle may overwhelm the cellular antioxidant capacity and trigger the cell-death process. Therefore, cancer cells with higher basal ROS level would be more dependent on the antioxidant system and more vulnerable to further oxidative stress-inducing agents, at mean time, cancer cells with higher NQ01 enzyme level further face higher ROS stress caused by NQ01 dependent exogenous ROS-generating agent.

Determination of NQ01 Enzymatic Activity in Cell Lysate (Part A of FIG. 4): Assay was performed as described in the paper (Traver R D, et al. British Journal of Cancer, 1997, 75: 69-75). Cancer cells were grown to 80% confluence, and then washed with PBS buffer and scraped into ice-cold buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 125 mM sucrose). The cancer cell suspension had been frozen-thawed for three times and then adjusted to 5 mg/ml in protein concentration. The mixture was used as cell lysate for NQ01 enzymatic activity assay. Assay mixture comprised 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 0.7 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.2 mM NADH and 40 μM dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP); Dicumarol (NQ01 inhibitor) was added to the assay mixture as reference solution. 1% volume of cell lysate was added into the assay mixture and the reference solution, respectively. The resulting mixtures were incubated at 25° C. for 10 minutes. The relative NQ01 enzymatic activity was obtained by the absorbance difference at 600 nm between the incubated assay mixture and the reference solution. Effect of NQ01 Inhibitor (Dicumarol) on the Biological Activities of 2-acetyl-4,9-diacetoxy-naphtho[2,3-b]furan and Compound XIII (Part B and C of FIG. 4):MTT assay was used for this experiment. Same procedure as described in “Cell Viability Determination” section. Briefly, cancer cells were inoculated on 96 well culture plates. After overnight incubation, drug was added into each well at the final concentration as indicated in FIG. 4. Another set of wells were added with the same drug plus dicumarol at the final concentration of 40 μM. The viability of cells at each well was read out after 48 hr incubation in cell culture incubator. Evaluation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Level in Cells with Fluorescence Microscope (FIG. 5):To each well on an 8 well plate, filled 1,000 μl of DLD1 cell suspension (100-150 cells/0 in culture medium, then incubated the plate at 37° C. overnight. The seeded cells in the plate were washed with PBS buffer twice, and then added freshly prepared 40 μM dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) in culture medium, and incubated the mixture for 5 min at 37° C. Following several PBS washes, cells were exposed to 1,000 μl medium containing: 0.3 μM test compound, or 100 μM hydrogen peroxide, or DMSO only (control). After incubation for 30 min at 37° C., the fluorescence picture was taken from each well by using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70 Inverted) with the excitation filter set at 488 nm and the emission filter at 530 nm. Effect of Antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) on the Biological Activities of Hydrogen Peroxide and Compound XIII (FIG. 6): MTT assay was used for this experiment. Same procedure as described in “Cell Viability Determination” section. Briefly, cancer cells were inoculated on 96 well culture plates. After overnight incubation, hydrogen peroxide (or drug) was added into each well at the final concentration as indicated in FIG. 6. Another set of wells were added with NAC to concentration of 40 mM first, 30 minutes later added with the same hydrogen peroxide (or drug). The viability of cells at each well was read out after 48 hr incubation in cell culture incubator. Effect of Drug Incubation Time on the Biological Activities of Compound XIII (FIG. 7): MTT assay was used for this experiment. Same procedure as described in “Cell Viability Determination” section. Briefly, cancer cells were inoculated on 96 well culture plates. After overnight incubation, compound XIII was added into each well at the final concentration as indicated in FIG. 7. After 4 hours incubation, the 4 hour treatment plates were washed by culture medium to remove drug and refilled with fresh medium, then all plates were incubated for additional 48 hours. The viability of cells at each well was read out using MTT method. Preliminary Toxicity Study of Compound I and XIII (FIGS. 8 and 10): Amorphous solid of compound I or XIII was suspended in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solution in a mortar at concentration of 90 mg/ml for compound I and 60 mg/ml for compound XIII. Then each of the mixtures was then orally administered into three ICR mice (30 grams in average weight) with gavage feeding at the dosage of 1,200 mg/kg for compound I or 800 mg/ml for compound XIII once daily for 7 days. Weight of each mouse was recorded before gavage feeding.
