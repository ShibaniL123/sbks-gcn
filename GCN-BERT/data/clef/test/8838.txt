[Step 4] Synthesis of tert-butyl 4-((2-fluoro-4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)(phenyl)carbamoyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 4-((2-fluoro-4-(2-(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)benzyl)(phenyl)carbamoyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (1.400 g, 2.471 mmol), synthesized in step 3, and 1-methoxy-N-triethylammoniosulfonyl-methanimidate (Burgess reagent, 0.883 g, 3.707 mmol) were mixed in tetrahydrofuran (100 mL) at room temperature, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 12 hours, and then cooled down to room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent, and the concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 80 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = 10% to 30%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.740 g, 54.6%) as a white solid.
