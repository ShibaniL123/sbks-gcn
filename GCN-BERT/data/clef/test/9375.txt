Step 6: 2-(bromomethyl)-5-(d3)methylpyrimidine
To a solution of [5-(d3)methylpyrimidin-2-yl]methanol [Example 10, Step 5] (500 mg, 3.94 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in DCM (10 mL) was added PPh3 (1.03 g, 3.94 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and NBS (701.3 mg, 2.02 mmol, 1.00 equiv) at 0° C. The resulting solution was stirred for 1 h at 0° C. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of H2O (10 mL). The resulting solution was extracted with DCM (3×10 mL). The organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was applied onto a silica gel column with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1:2) to afford 300 mg (40.2%) of 2-(bromomethyl)-5-(d3)methylpyrimidine as a yellow oil.
