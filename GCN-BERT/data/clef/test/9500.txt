GOVERNMENT SUPPORT This invention was made with government support under R01 CA 129105, R01 CA103866, and R01 AI047389 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to methods of identifying compounds that modulate mTORCl activity in a cell by modulating the activity of SLC38A9 (NCBI Gene ID: 153129), as well as to the use of such identified compounds in the modulation of mTORCl and the treatment of diseases and conditions characterized by aberrant mTORCl activity. The mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a master regulator of cell, organ and organismal growth in response to nutrients, growth factors and stress factors. mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase and nucleates at least two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1, mTORCl, and mTOR complex 2, mTORC2. mTORCl activity is regulated in part by amino acids. When activated, mTORCl can stimulate cell growth by promoting anabolic processes such as mRNA translation and inhibiting catabolic processes such as autophagy through the actions of its downstream substrates. However, aberrant mTORCl activation has been observed in a wide range of diseases including multiple types of cancer, metabolic dysfunction (e.g. type 2 diabetes, obesity), auto-immune diseases (e.g. psoriasis) and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease), neuropsychiatric syndromes (e.g. autism and major depressive disorders), skeletal muscle dysfunction (e.g. sarcopenia, disease induced cachexia and disuse atrophy), as well as several rare diseases including those resulting from inherited and acquired mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g. Leigh Syndrome) and certain inherited growth defects. The mechanism by which amino acids regulate mTORCl signaling is complex and is centered on the lysosome. In amino acid replete conditions, amino acids cross the plasma membrane and accumulate within the lumen of the lysosome. In addition, the degradation of protein in the lysosomal lumen by lysosomal proteases and peptidases can also contribute to the accumulation of amino acids within the lysosome and lead to mTORCl activation. mTORCl is recruited to the lysosomal membrane where it interacts with the Rag GTPases— obligate heterodimers of Rag A or RagB with RagC or RagD. The Rag GTPase heterodimer does not contain lipid anchors tethering the complex to the lysosome. Instead, it relies upon the pentameric Ragulator complex, which is tethered to the lysosomal membrane via lipidation of the Ragulator component LAMTOR1 (pi 8) for lysosomal localization. Furthermore, the Ragulator components LAMTOR2-5 (pi 4, MP1, C7orf59 and HBXIP, respectively) assembled with LAMTOR1 acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RagA and RagB, fostering their loading with GTP. As a result, Ragulator is not only necessary for localizing the Rag GTPase heterodimer to the lysosomal surface, but for also catalyzing the activated nucleotide binding state of the RagA/B. Additional protein complexes responsive to the availability of amino acids have been identified that regulate the activity of the Ragulator and Rag complexes, but the precise mechanism by which individual amino acids are physically sensed by the mTORCl pathway has not been elucidated. Given the known role that leucine and arginine play in activating mTORCl , we hypothesized that proteins exist that are able to specifically sense leucine or arginine at the lysosome and in response activate the lysosomal machinery upstream of mTORC 1. We sought to identify such proteins through proteomic and biochemical approaches. Given the importance of mTORCl modulation in both anabolic processes and in certain disease states, there is a need to identify other members of the mTORCl activation pathway as potential targets for modulation, which in turn can modulate mTORCl activity. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention solves this problem by identifying the protein isoforms of SLC38A9 as an important component of the mTORCl regulatory pathway and as the putative amino acid sensor in that pathway that may be pharmacologically manipulated resulting in the selective modulation of mTORCl activation. In certain embodiments, disclosed herein are methods of identifying a modulator of mTORCl activity, such methods comprising the steps of: (a) contacting a test compound with SLC38A9.1 or a fragment or mutant thereof that possesses an activity or characteristic of SLC38A9.1 ; (b) measuring an activity or characteristic of SLC38A9.1 in the presence of the test compound; and (c) comparing the measured activity or characteristic with the same activity or characteristic in the absence of the test compound, thereby determining whether the test compound is a modulator of SLC38A9. In certain aspects, the test compound is contacted with SLC38A9.1 , SLC38A9 Δ1 10, or amino acids 1-1 19 of SEQ ID NO: l or a fusion protein comprising STC38A9.1 , SLC38A9 Δ1 10 or amino acids 1-1 19 of SEQ ID NO: l ; and a heterologous fusion partner. In certain embodiments, the heterologous fusion partner is selected from a N-terminal His tag, a N-terminal poly-His tag, an epitope tag, a ligand tag, a N- or C-terminal plasma membrane signal sequence, a fluorescent polypeptide, or a luminescent polypeptide. In certain embodiments, the activity or characteristic of SLC38A9.1 is the ability to transfer an amino acid across a membrane. In certain embodiments, the activity or characteristic of SLC38A9.1 is the ability to associate with components of one or more of Ragulator or a RagGTPase. Also disclosed herein are methods for modulating the level or activity of mTORCl in a cell, comprising contacting a cell with an agent or composition that modulates the level or activity of STC38A9. In certain aspects, modulating the level or activity of mTORCl in the cell comprises increasing the level or activity of mTORC l in the cell. In certain embodiments, modulating the level or activity of mTORCl in the cell comprises decreasing the level or activity of mTORCl in the cell. In certain embodiments, also disclosed herein are methods for increasing mTORC 1 activity in a patient that requires an increase in mTORC 1 activity, such methods comprising a step of administering to the patient an agent that activates or agonizes SLC38A9, thereby increasing mTORCl activity in the patient. In yet other embodiments, disclosed are methods for decreasing mTORCl activity in a patient that requires a decrease in mTORCl activity comprising the step of administering to the patient an agent that inhibits SLC38A9, thereby decreasing mTORCl activity in the patient. Also disclosed herein are methods for treating a disease, condition, or disorder which would benefit from increasing the level or activation of mTORCl in a patient, such methods comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an agent which activates or agonizes STC38A9, and thereby treating the disease, condition, or disorder. In certain aspects, disclosed herein are methods for treating a disease, condition, or disorder which would benefit from decreasing the level or activation of mTORCl in a patient, the method comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an agent which inhibits SLC38 A9 activity, and thereby treating the disease, condition, or disorder.

In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of identifying modulators of SLC38A9 comprising the steps of: a) contacting a test compound with a polypeptide comprising SLC38A9.1, or a fragment or mutant of SLC38A9.1 , wherein the polypeptide possesses an activity or characteristic of SLC38A9.1 ; b) measuring the activity or characteristic of SLC38A9.1 in the presence of the test compound; and c) comparing the measured activity or characteristic with the same activity or characteristic in the absence of the test compound, thereby determining whether the test compound is a modulator of SLC38A9. These methods may employ cellular systems where the SLC38A9 or a fragment or mutant thereof is engineered to reside at the plasma membrane (e.g., by fusion of the N-terminus to a plasma membrane signal sequence, e.g., the last 25 amino acids of H-Ras - (QHKLRKLNPPDESGPGCMSCKCVLS; SEQ ID NO:5); non-mammalian cellular systems that are engineered to express the SLC38A9 or a fragment or mutant thereof at the plasma membrane (e.g., Xenopus oocytes); in vitro systems where the SLC38A9 or a fragment or mutant thereof is attached to a solid support; and in vitro systems where the SLC38A9 or a fragment or mutant thereof is free in solution. Activities or characteristics to be measured in these methods include uptake of labelled (e.g., radiolabeled, fluorescently labelled) amino acids (e.g., arginine, histidine or lysine) in cellular systems, uptake of sodium in cellular systems, changes in membrane potential across a membrane in cellular systems, binding of amino acids to SLC38A9 or a fragment or mutant thereof in in vitro systems; binding of test compound to SLC38A9 or a fragment or mutant thereof in in vitro systems; changes in the ability of SLC38A9 or a fragment or mutant thereof to bind to Ragulator in both in vivo and in vitro systems; and changes in one or more activities of mTORCl (e.g., change in phosphorylation state of S6K1). The measurement of these activities may be achieved by scintillation counting for radiolabelled amino acids; flow cytometry, fluorescence microplate or with a spectrofluorophotometer for fluorescent amino acids and to measure changes in membrane potential (e.g., dyes that change fluorescence in response to changes in membrane potential, e.g., FLIPR dyes (Molecular Devices); patch clamping for measuring electrical currents across a membrane; solid phase surface plasmon resonance to measure changes in amino acid binding or direct binding of test compound; and mass spectrometry to measure changes in amino acid binding or direct binding of test compound. The choice of a fragment or mutant of SLC38A9.1 to be used in such methods will be dependent upon the activity to be measured. Fragments lacking amino acids 1 -1 10, as well as SLC38A9 isoform 2 and 4, do not interact with Ragulator and therefore should be avoided when the activity to be measured is dependent upon Ragulator interaction. However, fragments lacking amino acid 1-1 10 do still bind to and transport amino acids and therefore can be employed in assays that measure amino acid binding and transport either directly or indirectly. In one embodiment, intact SLC38A9.1 or SLC38A9.1 Δ1 10 is used in assays that measure amino acid binding and transport either directly or indirectly. The polypeptide comprising SLC38A9.1, or a fragment or mutant of SLC38A9, may also include other amino acid sequences that impart additional desirable properties to the polypeptide that are useful in these methods. In some embodiments, the polypeptide further comprises a tag at the N- or C -terminus that aids in the recombinant production of the polypeptide and/or isolation of the polypeptide. Such tags include histidine or poly-histidine tags, epitope tags (e.g., FLAG or HA polypeptide fusions) or ligand tags (e.g., biotin), which may be covalently bound directly to SLC38A9.1 , or a fragment or mutant thereof or through a linker. In some embodiments, the polypeptide further comprises a signal sequence that targets the polypeptide to the plasma membrane (e.g., the last 25 amino acids of H-Ras - QHKLRKLNPPDESGPGCMSCKCVLS; SEQ ID NO:5). In some embodiments, the polypeptide further comprises a fluorescent or bioluminescent tag or polypeptide sequence (e.g., fusion to a green fluorescent protein, yellow fluorescence protein, red fluorescent protein, or luciferase).

EXAMPLES Example 1. SLC38A9 interacts with Ragulator. It remains unclear how the presence or absence of amino acids triggers the complex network of lysosomal proteins that mediate the translocation and activation of mTORCl . One hypothesis was that a putative amino acid sensor would directly interact with one of the lysosomal complexes involved in signaling to mTORCl . To test this hypothesis, we initially focused on the Ragulator complex and performed immunoprecipitation from HEK-293T cells stably expressing various FLAG-tagged proteins under conditions that would preserve protein-protein interactions. The cDNAs for all human SLC38A9 isoforms, both native and codon- optimized, were gene-synthesized by GenScript. The cDNAs were amplified by PCR and the products were subcloned into Sal I and Not I sites of HA-pR 5 and FLAG- pRK5. The cDNAs were mutagenized using the QuikChange II kit (Agilent) with oligonucleotides obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. FLAG-tagged SLC38A9 isoforms and SLC38A9 N-terminal 1 -1 19 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the Sal I and EcoR I sites of pLJM60 or into the Pac I and EcoR I sites of pMXs. After sequence verification, these plasmids were used, as described below, in cDNA transfections or to produce lentiviruses needed to generate cell lines stably expressing the proteins. HEK-293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 lU/mL), and streptomycin (100 μ§/ηιΕ) and maintained at 37°C and 5% C02. Two million HEK- 293T cells were plated in 10 cm culture dishes. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with the pRK5-based cDNA expression plasmids indicated in the figures in the following amounts: 500 ng FLAG-metap2; 50 ng FLAG-LAMP 1 ; 100 ng FLAG-RagB and 100 ng HA-RagC; 300 ng FLAG-SLC38A9.1 ; 600 ng FLAG-SLC38A9.1 A1 10; 200 ng FLAG- SLC38A9.4; 400 ng FLAG-N-terminal 1 19 fragment of SLC38A9.1 ; 200 ng FLAG- RagC; 200 ng FLAG-RagC S75N; 200 ng FLAG-RagC Q120L; 400 ng HAGST- RagB; 400 ng FIAGST-RagB T54N; 400 ng HAGST-RagB Q99L. Transfection mixes were taken up to a total of 5 μg of DNA using empty pRK5. HEK-293T cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged proteins were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM β- glycerol phosphate, 10 mM pyrophosphate, 2.5 mM MgC12 and 1 tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche) per 25 ml buffer). The soluble fractions from cell lysates were isolated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. For immunoprecipitates 30 μΕ of a 50% slurry of anti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma) were added to each lysate and incubated with rotation for 2-3 hr. at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 500 mM NaCl. Immunoprecipitated proteins were denatured by the addition of 50 μΕ of sample buffer and incubation at RT for 30 min. It is critical that the samples containing SLC38A9 are neither boiled nor frozen prior to resolution by SDS-PAGE and analysis by immunoblotting. A similar protocol was employed when preparing samples for mass spectrometry. Immunoprecipitates from 30 million HE -293T cells stably expressing FLAG-metap2, FLAG-pl 8, FLAG-pl4, FLAG-I IBX1P. FLAG-c7orf59, and FLAG- RagB were prepared as described below. Proteins were eluted with the FLAG peptide (sequence DYKDDDDK) from the anti-FLAG affinity beads, resolved on 4-12% NuPage® gels (Invitrogen), and stained with SimplyBluerM SafeStain (Invitrogen). Each gel lane was sliced into 10-12 pieces and the proteins in each gel slice digested overnight with trypsin. The resulting digests were then subjected to liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) for protein identification. SLC38A9 (NCBI Gene ID: 153129), a member of the amino acid/sodium family of co -transporters, was present in all Ragulator component- specific immunoprecipitations, as well as to some extent in immunoprecipitations of RagB, but not in immunoprecipitations of control protein Metap2. To confirm the LC-MS-MS data, we transfected HEK-293T cells with PL AG- tagged constructs of SLC38A9.1 using the protocol described above and were able to immunoprecipitate endogenous Ragulator proteins (as detected by its p 14 and pi 8 components) as well as RagA and RagC. Other FLAG-tagged lysosomal membrane proteins LAMP1 , SC36A1 and SLC38A7 did not immunoprecipitate any of pl4, pi 8, RagA or RagC (Fig. 1 D and Fig. 6A). We were also able to demonstrate binding between recombinant epitope tagged SLC38A9 and co-expressed epitope tagged Ragulator proteins. Having confirmed the mass- spectrometry data indicating that SLC38A9 interacts with Ragulator, we began to determine which region of SLC38A9 is responsible for its interaction with Ragulator. There are 4 distinct isoforms annotated by NCBI for SLC38A9; isoform 1 (SEQ ID NO: l) is the full-length protein; isoform 2 is missing the first 63 amino acids from the N-terminus of SEQ ID NO: l ; isoform 3 has a shorter, modified N-terminus and truncated C-terminus; and isoform 4 is missing the entire N-terminus region that precedes the first transmembrane domain (AA1 -1 19). We expressed isoforms 1 , 2 and 4 in HEK-293T cells, as well as a mutant of SLC38A9.1 lacking its first 1 10 amino acids (SLC38A9.1 Δ1 10) and found that isoform 1 strongly binds to Ragulator, whereas neither isoforms 2, 4 or SLC38A9.1 Δ1 10 were able to immunoprecipitate endogenous or co -transfected Ragulator proteins (Fig. 6, B and C). Given that isoform 4 was unable to precipitate Ragulator components, we focused on the N-terminus (AAl -119) as likely responsible for mediating the interaction between SLC38A9 and Ragulator. We developed an N-terminal FLAG- tagged construct consisting of just the N-terminus of SLC38A9, amino acid residues 1-1 19, and found that it was necessary and sufficient to immunoprecipitate Ragulator (FIG. 1 A and FIG. 6C). We looked at conserved residues between humans, zebrafish and C. elegans and found that amino acids 59-90 are strongly conserved. Substituting each residue with alanine in the AAl-1 19 construct identified the following mutations as disrupting the binding of the N-terminal region of SLC38A9 with Ragulator: 168 A, Y71 A, L74A, P85A, V89A, P90A. Alanine substitutions within this region that did not disrupt the interaction include D59A, H60A, S62A, S72A, R73A, P77A, D86A, and V88A. We concluded that 168, Y71 , L74, P85, and P90 were required for the Ragulator-SLC38A9.1 interaction (FIG. 1 E). Given its homology to other amino acid transporters, we performed immunoprecipitation assays between full-length SLC38A9 and Ragulator proteins under both amino acid replete and amino acid deficient culture conditions. We found the interaction between SLC38A9 and Ragulator proteins to be modulated by amino acid conditions similar to what is observed between Ragulator and Rag proteins. When this assay was repeated with just the N-terminus of SLC38A9 (amino acids 1 - 1 19 of SEQ ID NO: l), we did not observe any changes in response to amino acid levels. As a result, we believe that the interaction between SCL38A9 and Ragulator to be modified by amino acids, and that this modulation is important for its function as a regulator of mTORCl signaling in response to amino acids. It is likely that the transmembrane region of SLC38A9 is needed to mediate the response to amino acids. The v-ATPase and its activity are necessary for amino acid sensing by the mTORCl pathway and, like SLC38A9.1 , it co-immunoprecipitated with stably expressed FLAG-tagged Ragulator. This indicated the existence of a supercomplex of stably expressed SLC38A9.1, but not LAMP1 , associated with endogenous components of the v-ATPase in addition to Ragulator and the Rag GTPases (FIG. 1 C). Although SLC38A9.2 does not interact with Ragulator, it did co- immunoprecipitate the v-ATPase, albeit at lesser amounts than SLC38A9.1 (FIG. 1C). This suggests that the interaction between SLC38A9.1 and the v- ATPase is not mediated through Ragulator but directly or indirectly through the region of SLC38A9.1 that contains its transmembrane domains. Concordant with this interpretation, the N-terminal domain of SLC38A9.1, which interacts strongly with Ragulator, did not co-immunoprecipitate the vATPase (IG. 1C). Example 2. SLC38A9 is localized to the lysosomal membrane. Given its strong interaction with Ragulator and its homology to other SLC38 family members that contain canonical 5+5 transmembrane structures, we predicted that SLC38A9 is localized to the lysosomal membrane. HEK-293T cells were plated on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips in 6- well tissue culture dishes, at 300,000 cells/well. 12-16 hours later, the slides were rinsed with PBS once and fixed and permeabilized in one step with ice-cold 100% methanol (for SLC38A9 detection) at -20°C for 15 min. After rinsing twice with PBS, the slides were incubated with primary antibody (FLAG CST 1 :300, LAMP2 1 :400) in 5% normal donkey serum for 1 hr. at room temperature, rinsed four times with PBS, - 24 incubated with secondary antibodies produced in donkey (diluted 1 :400 in 5% normal donkey serum) for 45 min at room temperature in the dark, and washed four times with PBS. Slides were mounted on glass coverslips using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and imaged on a spinning disk confocal system (Perkin Elmer). Immunofluorescence imaging determined that all epitope tagged isoforms of SLC38A9 co-localized with lamp2 indicating that SLC38A9 is a lysosomal membrane protein (FIG. 2A and FIG. 7, A and B). We also stained for SLC38A9 and lamp2 in two different mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient for a Ragulator component, and SLC38A9 continued to be localized to the lysosome indicating that it does not require Ragulator for its lysosomal localization. Consistent with this finding, localizing Ragulator to the cytoplasm by removing its lipid anchor does not alter the lysosomal localization of SLC38A9, nor does the mutant Ragulator interact with SLC38A9.1 (FIG. 7C). These data indicate that SLC38A9 is a lysosomal membrane protein that does not require its N-terminus or Ragulator for localization to the lysosome. Lentiviruses encoding shRNAs were prepared and transduced into HE -293T cells as described follows. Lentiviruses were produced by co -transfection of the pLJMl/pLJM60 lenti viral transfer vector with the VSV-G envelope and CMV AVPR packaging plasmids into viral HEK-293T cells 4 using the XTremeGene 9 transfection reagent (Roche). For infection of HeLa cells, LN229 cells, and MEFs, retroviruses were produced by co-transfection of the pMXs retroviral transfer vector with the VSV-G envelope and Gag/Pol packaging plasmids into viral HEK-293T cells. The media was changed 24 hours post-transfection to DME supplemented with 30% IFS. The virus-containing supernatants were collected 48 hours after transfection and passed through a 0.45 μιη filter to eliminate cells. Target cells in 6-well tissue culture plates were infected in media containing 8 μg/mL polybrene and spin infections were performed by centrifugation at 2,200 rpm for 1 hour. 24 hours after infection, the virus was removed and the cells selected with the appropriate antibiotic. The sequences of control shRNAs and those targeting human SLC38A9, which were obtained from The RNAi Consortium 3 (TRC3), are the following (5' to 3'): SLC38A9 #1 : GCCTTGACAACAGTTCTATAT (TRCN0000151238) (SEQ ID NO: 6); SLC38A9 #2: CCTCTACTGTTTGGGACAGTA (TRCN0000156474) (SEQ ID NO:7); GFP: TGCCCGACAACCACTACCTGA (TRCN0000072186) (SEQ ID NO:8). For siRNA-based experiments, 200,000 HEK-293T cells were plated in a 6- well plate. 24 hours later, cells were transfected using DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon) with 250 nM of a pool of siRNAs (Dharmacon) targeting SLC38A9 or a non-targeting pool. 48 hours post-transfection, cells were transfected again but this time with double the amount of siRNAs. 24 hours following the second transfection, cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, lysed, and subjected to immunoblotting as described above. The following siRNAs were used: Non-targeting: ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting Pool (D-001810-10-05) SLC38A9: SMARTpool: ON-TARGETplus SLC38A9 (L-007337- 02-0005) ShRNA- or siRNA-mediated depletion of SLC38A9 in HEK-293T cells suppressed activation of mTORC 1 by amino acids, as detected by the phosphorylation of its established substrate ribosomal protein S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1 ) (Fig. 2B and Fig. 7D). Thus, like the five known subunits of Ragulator, SLC38A9.1 is a positive component of the mTORC 1 pathway. Without being bound by theory we believe that SLC38A9.1 is a lysosomal membrane protein that interacts with Ragulator and the Rag GTPases through its N-terminal 1 19 amino acids ('Ragulator-binding domain') and is required for mTORC 1 activation. Example 3. SLC38A9 over expression activates mTORC 1. Having established that SCL38A9 strongly interacts with Ragulator at the lysosome, we wished to understand the function of SLC38A9 in regulating mTORC 1 activity. Given that the SLC38 family is involved in transport of amino acids, we tested whether overexpression of SLC38A9 modulated mTORC 1 signaling in response to amino acids. In wild-type cells in culture, amino acid withdrawal results in inhibition of mTORC 1 signaling. One million HEK-293T cells were plated in 10 cm culture dishes. 24 hours later, cells were transfected with the pRK5 -based cDNA expression plasmids indicated in the figures in the following amounts: 500 ng HA-metap2; 50 ng HA- LAMP1 ; 200 ng HA-SLC38A9.1 ; 500 ng FIA-SLC38A9.1 Δ1 10; 200 ng HASLC38A9.4; 100 ng HA-RagB T54N and 100 ng HA-RagC Q120L; 2 ng FLAG- S6K1. 72 hours post-transfection, cells were washed once prior to 50-min incubation with amino acid-free RPMI. Cells were stimulated with vehicle or amino acids (to a final concentration equivalent to RPMI) prior to harvest. Transient or stable overexpression of SLC38A9 isoform 1 in HEK-293T cells rendered mTORC l signaling resistant to total amino acid starvation or to just starvation of leucine or arginine, as measured by the phosphorylation of Threonine 389 (T398) of exogenous S6K1- an established reporter for mTORCl activity within cells (Fig 3A and 8A). Commensurate with its effects on mTORCl , SLC38A9.1 overexpression suppressed the induction of autophagy caused by amino acid starvation (Fig. 8C). Transient overexpression of variants of SLC38A9 that do not interact with Ragulator and the Rag GTPases, including SLC38A9.2, SLC38A9.4, and the SLC38A9.1 Δ1 10 and SLC38A9.1 168 A mutants, failed to maintain mTORCl signaling after amino acid withdrawal (Fig. 3, B and C, and Fig. 8 A). STC38A9.1 overexpression also activated mTORCl in the absence of amino acids in HEK-293E, HeLa, and LN229 cells, as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), with the degree of activation proportionate to the amount of SLC38A9.1 expressed (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, overexpression of just the Ragulator- binding domain of SLC38A9.1 mimicked the effects of the full-length protein on mTORCl signaling (Fig. 3D), indicating that it can adopt an active state when separated from the transmembrane portion of SLC38A9.1. We also prepared SLC38A9.1 knockouts using CRISPR/CAS9. The CRISP R/CAS9 guide sequences designed to the N -terminus (amino acids 1 -119) of SLC38A9 or the AAVS1 locus disclosed below were cloned into pX459. AAVS 1 : GGGGCCACTAGGGACAGGAT (SEQ ID NO:9) SLC38A9J : GGCTCAAACTGGATATTCATAGG (SEQ ID NO: 10) SLC38A9_2: GGAGCTGGAACTACATGGTCTGG (SEQ ID NO.T 1) HEK-293T cells (750,000/well) were plated into 6 well dishes and transfected 16 hours later with 1 ng of pX459 expressing above guides using XtremeGene9. Cells were trypsinized 48 hours later, 2 mg/mL puromycin was applied for 72 hours, and allowed to recover for a few days. When cells were approaching confluency, they were single-cell sorted into 96-well dishes containing 30% serum and conditioned media. Clones were expanded and evaluated for knockout status by western analysis for SLC38A9. These clones were evaluated for amino acid response as described above. HEK-293T cells depleted of SLC38A9 using CRISPR/CAS9 genome editing technology demonstrated partial inhibition of mTORC 1 activation in response to amino acid stimulation. Based on these data, we hypothesize that SLC38A9 is a positive regulator of mTORC 1 signaling in response to amino acids. Example 4. LC-MS-MS Identification of Potential SLC38A9 Binding Partners. Using LC-MS-MS we identified TMEM192 (NCBI Gene ID: 201931), SLC12A9 (NCBI Gene ID: 56996) and CLCN7 (NCBI Gene ID: 1 186) as potential protein binding partners with which SLC38A9 may homo-oligomerize and/or hetero- oligomerize. We believe that SLC38A9 may be associated with one or more of these other proteins as part of its function as an amino acid sensor upstream of mTORC 1. Example 5. Glycosylation Analysis of SLC38A9. In resolving expression of SLC38A9 by SDS-PAGE, we observed protein bands at higher molecular weight than expected. This is similar to patterns observed for glycosylated membrane proteins. Therefore, we conducted a bioinformatic analysis of the sequence of SLC38A9 and found that residues 1 17, 239, 248, 266 and 274 are potentially N-glycosylated. We believe, without being bound by theory, that glycosylation may play a role in the localization and function of SLC38A9 as an amino acid sensor and regulator of mTORC 1 signaling. Glycosylation may also protect protein SLC38A9 from cleavage by lysosomal proteases. Example 6. Modulation of the SLC38A9-Rag-Ragulator Interactions by Amino Acids Amino acids modulate the interactions between many of the established components of the amino acid sensing pathway, so we tested if this was also the case for the SLC38A9.1 - Ragulator-Rag complex. HEK-293T cells (150,000/well) were plated onto fibronectin-coated 12- well dishes and transfected 12 hours later with the pRK5-based cDNA expression plasmids indicated in the figures in the following amounts using XtremeGene9: 400 ng LAMP1 -FLAG, 400 ng FLAGSLC38A9.1, 400 ng SLC38A2-FLAG, 150 ng PQLC2-FLAG, and 50 ng GFP. Transfection mixes were taken up to a total of 2 μg of DNA using empty pRK5. Cells were assayed 48 hours later by washing twice in transport buffer (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCL 2 mM MgC12, 2 mM CaC12, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pi 1 7.4, 5 mM glucose), incubating in transport buffer for 5 min. at 37°C before replacing the . 28 buffer with fresh buffer supplemented with amino acids (unlabeled and 0.1 μϋϊ of [14C]leucine at a total concentration of 380 μΜ, or unlabeled and 0.1 μϋϊ of [14C]amino acid mix at total concentrations found in RPMT, or unlabeled and 0.2 μ€ι of [14C]arginine at a total concentration of 3 mM) at the indicated pH (pH 5 buffered by MES, pH 8 buffered by Tris) for 10 minutes at 37°C. After uptake, cells were washed twice in ice-cold transport buffer and harvested in 0.5 n L of 1 % SDS for scintillation counting. Indeed, amino acid starvation strengthened the interaction between stably expressed or endogenous Ragulator and endogenous SLC38A9 (Fig. 4A, Fig. 9); and between stably expressed SLC38A9.1 and endogenous Ragulator and Rags (Fig. 4B). We obtained similar results when cells were deprived of and stimulated with just leucine or arginine (Fig. 4A). Curiously, although the N-terminal domain of SLC38A9.1 readily bound Ragulator, the interaction was insensitive to amino acids (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the transmembrane region is required to confer amino acid responsiveness. As amino acid starvation alters the nucleotide state of the Rag GTPases, we tested whether SLC38A9 interacted differentially with mutants of the Rags that lock their nucleotide state. Heterodimers of epitope-tagged RagB-RagC containing RagBT54N, which mimics the GDP-bound state, were associated with more endogenous SLC38A9 than heterodimers containing wild-type RagB (Fig. 4C). In contrast, heterodimers containing RagBQ99L, which lacks GTPase activity and so is bound to OTP interacted very weakly with SLC38A9 (Fig. 4C). Thus, like Ragulator, SLC38A9 interacts best with Rag heterodimers in which RagA/B is GDP-loaded, which is consistent with SLC38A9 binding to Ragulator and with Ragulator being a GEF for RagA/B. These results suggest that amino acid modulation of the interaction of SLC38A9.1 with Rag-Ragulator largely reflects amino acid-induced changes in the nucleotide state of the Rag GTPases. Because the RagB mutations had greater effects on the interaction of the Rag GTPases with SLC38A9 than with Ragulator (in Figure 4C compare the SLC38A9 blots with those for p 14 and pi 8), it is very likely that the Rag heterodimers make Ragulator-independent contacts with SLC38A9 that affect the stability of Rag-SLC38A9 interaction. Example 6. SLC38A9.1 is an Amino Acid Transporter We failed to detect SLC38A9.1 -mediated amino acid transport or amino acid- induced sodium currents in live cells in which SLC38A9.1 was so highly overexpressed that some reached the plasma membrane (Fig. 10, A-E). Because these experiments were confounded by the presence of endogenous transporters or relied on indirect measurements of transport, respectively, we reconstituted SLC38A9.1 or SLC38A9-A1 10 into liposomes to directly assay the transport of radiolabelled amino acids. HEK-293T cells stably expressing FLAG-SLC38A9.1 were harvested as described above for immunoprecipitations, except cells were lysed in 40 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors. Following a 3 hr. immunoprecipitation, FLAG-affmity beads were washed twice for 5 min each in lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mM NaCl. Beads were equilibrated with inside buffer (20 mM MES pH 5, 90 mM KC1 10 mM NaCl) supplemented with 10% glycerol by washing them 5 times. FLAG-affmity purified SLC38A9.1 protein was eluted in glycerol -supplemented inside buffer containing 1 mg/mL FLAG peptide by rotation for 30 min. Protein was concentrated using Amicon centrifuge filters to about 1 mg/mL and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Purification of SLC38A9-A1 10 was performed as follows. Two liters of suspension 293F cells transiently transfected with His-SLC38A9-Al 10 were pelleted and the resulting cell paste went through 3 rounds of homogenization using a dounce homogenizer in 25mM Tris, lOmM MgCl2, 20mM KC1, pH 7.5 followed by ultra- centrifugation. After the third round, the resulting cell pellet went through 3 additional rounds of homogenization using a dounce homogenizer in 25mM Tris, 1M NaCl, l OmM MgCl2, 20mM C1, pH 7.5 followed by ultra-centrifugation. The resulting pellet was then suspended in 25mM Hepes, 150mM NaCl, 5%glycerol, 2%>DDM, pH7.5 (plus protease inhibitor tablets) and incubated overnight before ultra- centrifugation and collection of the resulting supernatant. His-SLC38A9- Δ1 10 was purified from the resulting supernatant by cobalt affinity column and eluted in 250mM imidazole in 25mM Hepes, 150mM NaCl, 5%glycerol, 0.05%DDM, pi 17.5. To form liposomes, chloroform-dissolved phosphatidylcholine (PC, 50 mg) was evaporated using dry nitrogen to yield a lipid film in a round bottom flask and desiccated overnight under vacuum. Lipids were hydrated in inside buffer at 50 mg/mL with light sonication in a water bath (Branson M2800H) and split into 100 aliquots in Eppendorf tubes. Aliquoted lipids were clarified using water bath sonication and recombined and extruded through a 100 nm membrane with 15 passes (Avanti 61000). Reconstitution reaction (15 μg FLAG-SLC38A9.1 protein or 15 μg His-SLC38A9-Al 10, 7.5 mg Triton X-100, 10 mg extruded PC, 1 mM DTT in inside buffer up to 700 μΤ) was initiated by rotating at 4°C for 30 min. Glycerol- supplemented inside buffer was used in lieu of SLC38A9.1 protein in liposome only controls. Bio-beads (200 mg/reaction) were prepared by washing 1 time in methanol, 5 times in water and 2 times in inside buffer. Reconstitution reaction was applied to Bio-beads for 1 hr, transferred to fresh Bio-beads overnight, and transferred again to fresh Biobeads for 1 hr. To assay for amino acid transport, all buffers were chilled and assays performed in a 4°C cold room. For time course experiments, SLC38A9.1 proteoliposomes or liposome controls were applied to PD10 columns equilibrated with outside buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl) and eluted according to manufacturer's instructions. Amino acid uptake was initiated by the addition of 0.5 μΜ [3H]ar ginine and incubated in a 30°C water bath. Time points were collected by taking a fraction of the assay reaction and applying it to PD 10 columns pre- equilibrated with outside buffer. Columns were eluted in fractions or a single elution of 1.75 mL and added to 5 ml . of scintillation fluid. To obtain accurate measures of amino acid concentrations, equal volumes of outside buffer was added to scintillation fluid in the standards. For competition experiments with unlabeled amino acids, high concentrations of amino acids were required due to the high Km (~39mM) of SLC38A9.1 import activity. SLC38A9.1 proteoliposomes or liposome controls were centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min. in a TLA- 100.3 rotor and resuspended in a smaller volume of outside buffer such that they could be added to a larger volume of 100 mM unlabeled amino acid (final concentration) supplemented with outside buffer components. We had to resort to this procedure due to the solubility limit of leucine at -130 mM. At such high concentrations, it is important to adjust all amino acid solutions to pH 7.4. Assays were initiated by addition of 0.5 μΜ [3H]arginine to the amino acid buffer solution followed by the addition of SLC38A9.1 proteoliposomes or liposome controls. For steady-state kinetics experiments, time points were collected as described above and to assess substrate specificity, competition experiments were collected at 75 min. For efflux experiments, SLC38A9.1 proteoliposomes or liposome controls were loaded with [¾]ar ginine as described above for an import assay for 1.5 hrs. To remove external amino acids, the reactions were applied to PD 10 columns pre- equilibrated with outside buffer, and time points were collected as described above. Scintillation counts from liposome controls were subtracted from that of SLC38A9.1 proteoliposomes. Affinity-purified SLC38A9.1 or SCL38A9 Δ1 10 inserted unidirectionally into liposomes each exhibited time-dependent uptake of radiolabelled arginine while those containing LAMPl interacted with similar amounts of arginine as liposomes (Fig. 5 A, Fig 1 1 , Fig. 10F). Steady-state kinetic experiments revealed that SLC38A9.1 has a Michaelis constant (Km) of -39 mM and a catalytic rate constant (kcat) of -1.8 min"1 (Fig. 5B), indicating that SLC38A9.1 is a low-affinity amino acid transporter. SLC38A9.1 can also efflux arginine from the proteoliposomes (Fig. 5C), but its orientation in liposomes makes it impossible to obtain accurate Km and kcat measurements for this activity. It is likely that by having to assay the transporter in the 'backwards' direction we are underestimating its affinity for amino acids during their export from lysosomes. To assess the substrate specificity of SLC38A9.1 , we performed competition experiments using unlabeled amino acids (Fig. 5D). The positively charged amino acids histidine and lysine competed radiolabelled arginine transport to similar degrees as arginine, while leucine had a modest effect and glycine was the least effective competitor. Thus, it appears that SLC38A9.1 has a relatively non-specific substrate profile with a preference for polar amino acids. Given the preference of SLC38A9.1 for the transport of arginine and that arginine is highly concentrated in rat liver lysosomes and yeast vacuoles, we asked whether SLC38A9.1 may have an important role in transmitting arginine levels to mTORCl . Towards this end we examined how mTORCl signaling responded to a range of arginine or leucine concentrations in HEK-293T cells in which we knocked out SLC38A9 using CRISPR/CAS9 genome editing as described above in Example 4. Interestingly, activation of mTORCl by arginine was strongly repressed at all arginine concentrations in SLC38A9 knockouts, while the response to leucine was only blunted so that high leucine concentrations activated mTORCl equally well in null and control cells (Fig. 5F). Based on the findings described above, and without being bound by theory, we believe SLC38A9 binds sodium and specific amino acids, and in response likely undergoes conformational changes that result in mTORCl activation through its interaction with Ragulator. Regarding amino acid substrate specificity, we believe SLC38A9 binds amino acids important to mTORCl such as leucine, arginine, lysine and/or natural or synthetic derivatives of these, but we believe that SLC38A9.1 is a strong candidate for being a lysosome-based arginine sensor for the mTORCl pathway. Binding of amino acids by SLC38A9 may also result in their transport across the lysosomal membrane. Given the pH sensitivity of other SLC38 family members as well as the pH sensitivity of amino acid sensing by mTORCl , we believe that increasing the intra-lysosomal pH is likely to inhibit signaling of SLC38A9 to mTORCl , while fluctuations in pH of the lysosome may be important for modulating the activity of SLC38A9 to mTORCl . Furthermore, the sodium binding site characteristic of the SLC38 family is present in SLC38A9; therefore, we speculate that it may also conduct a sodium current at the lysosomal membrane and that such a current may be modulated by amino acids and may be important for mTORCl function. Example 7. Assays to measure interaction between SLC38A9 or amino acids 1-119 of SEQ ID NO:l with the Rag C/B heterodimer or Ragulator. Test compounds that modulate mTORCl activity can be identified via assays that determine its effect on the interaction between SLC38A9.1 (or amino acids 1-1 19 of SEQ ID NOT ) and the Rag heterodimer. Test compounds are incubated for a period of time with a cultured cell line that stably expresses either: (i) endogenous SLC38A9.1 and either Rag heterodimers or Ragulator components; or (ii) a combination of epitope tagged SLC38A9.1 (or amino acids 1 -119 of SEQ ID NOT) and/or epitope tagged RagA or RagB or RagC or RagD, and/or epitope tagged Ragulator components (pi 8, MPl , pi 4, HBXIP, C7orf59), wherein the tags do not prevent exogenous amino acids from modulating mTORCl signaling. After compound treatment, cells are lysed and endogenous or epitope-tagged Rag or Ragulator component(s) are immunoprecipitated as described in the art (Sancak et. al. Cell 141 , 290-303, April 16, 2010). Samples are then de-glycosylated, processed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for endogenous or epitope-tagged SLC38A9.1 or epitope-tagged-SLC38A9.1 or epitope tagged amino acids 1 -1 19 of SEQ ID NO: l as described above. In another embodiment of this assay, endogenous or epitope-tagged Rag or Ragulator component(s) are captured on an immobilized surface via the appropriate antibody, and a sandwich ELISA is then performed for endogenous or epitope-tagged SLC38A9.1 or amino acids 1-1 19 of SEQ ID NO: l , as described according to the art (Daniele et al. Scientific Reports 4, Article number: 4749, 2014). In still another version of this assay, the ELISA is performed with either fluorescent or luminescent substrates as described in the art (See, http://csmedia2.corning.com/LifeSciences/media/pdf/elisa5.pdf). The assays described in this Example 7 are be performed in cells that are starved for all amino acids, cells starved for arginine, cells starved for all amino acids and stimulated with all amino acids, cells starved for arginine and stimulated with arginine, and/or cells starved for all amino acids and stimulated with arginine. Example 8. Assay to Identify Modulators of SLC38A9 Activity A. Localization of SLC38A9 or SLC38A9 Δ1 10 to the Plasma Membrane. Certain assays that are performed in live cells that require expression and localization of SLC38A9 to the plasma membrane. To localize SLC38A9 to the plasma membrane, the N- or C-terminus of SLC38A9 is fused to the last 25 amino acids of H-Ras (QH LRKLNPPDESGPGCMSCKCVLS). Alternatively, this 25 amino acid portion of H-Ras can be fused to the N or C-terminus of any peptide or polypeptide fragment or mutant of SLC38A9 that binds and is capable of transporting amino acids across a membrane, such as SLC38A9 Δ1 10. Such fusion proteins are targeted to and expressed at the plasma membrane. Alternatively, the lysosomal localization sequence of SLC38A9 or any peptide or polypeptide fragment or mutant of SLC38A9 that binds and is capable of transporting amino acids across a membrane, such as SLC38A9 Δ1 10, is mutagenized. This would also target the resulting peptides, polypeptides or proteins to the plasma membrane as demonstrated in the art (Biochem J. 434(2):219-31 , 201 1). Any of the above-described constructs are either transiently transfected or stably expressed in a cell line of choice, such as HEK-239 cells. B. Radiolabeled substrate uptake assay: Radiolabeled substrate uptake assays are performed in adherent or suspension cells expressing SLC38A9 or any peptide or polypeptide fragment or mutant of SLC38A9 that binds and is capable of transporting amino acids across a membrane, such as SLC38A9 Δ1 10, as described in the art (The Journal of Neuroscience, 14: 5559-5569, 1994). Briefly, cells are incubated in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered - 34 saline (D-PBS) in the presence or absence of a test compound at room temperature for a period of time prior to or concurrently with the addition of radiolabeled amino acid substrates. For testing of transport of SLC38A9 or SLC38A9 Al 10, transport is assessed for tritiated (3H)-arginine, (3H)-histidine and (3H)~lysine at different concentrations and for different periods of time. At termination of the assay, adherent cells are washed three times in ice-cold D-PBS, solubilized in 0.1% SDS and processed for scintillation counting in an appropriate scintillation fluid (for example, ScintiVerse from Fisher Scientific). For suspension cells, at termination of the assay, the suspension are passed through Whatman GF/F micro-fiber filters (or a similar style filter), washed, and processed for scintillation counting in a standard manner. The values from these experiments may be used to calculate the substrate affinity constant. Compounds that result in lower scintillation counts are considered inhibitors of SLC38A9, while compounds that increased scintillation counts are considered SLC38A9 agonists. C. Fluorescent substrate uptake assay: Transport of fluorescently labeled amino acid substrates for SLC38A9is also measured in intact cells. The assay is the same as described for H-substrate uptake, with the test compound being added to the cells prior to or simultaneously with fluorescent amino acid substrates. Upon termination of the assay, the amount of fluorescent substrate taken up by cells is measured by a fluorescence microplate reader, fluorescent microscope or by flow cytometry as is performed in the art (Journal of Neuroscience Methods 169, 168-176, 2008). Changes in substrate uptake in response to compound are measured by changes in intra-cellular fluorescent intensity. D. Intact cell-based scintillation proximity assay: Real-time analysis of 3H-substrate uptake by cells expressing plasma- membrane localized SLC38A9 or SLC38A9 Δ 1 10 is accomplished using scintillant coated 96 or 384-well tissue-culture treated micro well plates (such as Cytostar-T plates from Perkin Elmer) according to the state of the art (Anal Biochem. 366(2): 1 17-25, 2007). Briefly, adherent or suspension cells are grown to confiuency in the scintillating micro well plates, washed and incubated with Hank's balanced salt solution or D-PBS containing 3H-amino acids substrates at different concentrations. Test compounds are added to cell -containing wells at various concentrations prior to or simultaneously with 3H-substrates. Real-time uptake of radiolabeled substrate is measured for a given amount of time by placing plate in a photomultiplier tube-based radiometric detector instrument capable of reading signals from a 96 or 384 well plate. E. Fluorescent-based transporter assays to detect sodium transport: SLC38A9 belongs to a family of sodium-dependent amino acid transporters and contains the amino acids required to coordinate and transport sodium. Transporter assays that detect the uptake of sodium are performed using sodium sensitive fluorescent dyes such as sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI) (J Biol Chem. 264(32): 19449-57, 1989), CoroNa Green (J Physiol 498, 295-307, 1997), or Asante NaTRIUM Green 1 (Neurolmage, Volume 58:2, 572-578, 201 1). Briefly, cells expressing SLC38A9, SLC38A9 Δ1 10, or control proteins at the plasma membrane are pre-loaded with cell-permeable acetoxymethyl esters of the sodium- sensitive fluorescent dye as determined in the art, (Methods Enzymol 192:38-81 , 1990), washed, and then incubated with test compounds at various concentrations either prior to or simultaneously with substrate amino acids and sodium chloride. When comparing cells overexpressing plasma membrane localized SLC38A9 or SLC38A9 Δ1 10 to cells expressing a negative control protein, an increase in fluorescence signal upon incubation with amino acid substrate and sodium chloride indicates increased sodium uptake due to transport via SLC38A9 or SLC38A9 Δ1 10. Changes in fluorescent intensity can be measured either via flow cytometry, fluorescence microplate or a spectrofluorophotometer. F, Membrane potential assays: The transport of sodium across a membrane by SLC38A9 may also lead to changes in membrane potential. There are multiple dyes available that, when pre- incubated with cells, allow changes in membrane protein to be measured by changes in fluorescence (such as FLIPR membrane potential dyes by Molecular Devices). Briefly, adherent cells are grown in black opaque microwell plates, washed, incubated in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution and membrane potential dye for a period of time sufficient to allow cells to be loaded with dye. The cells are then incubated with test compound. After incubation with test compound, the dye-loaded cell plate is loaded onto a FLIPR workstation, which allows for real-time detection of plasma membrane potential changes upon addition of amino acid substrates and sodium chloride (Assay and Drug Development Technologies, 6:2, 2008). Test compounds that prevent changes in membrane potential upon incubation with substrate and sodium chloride are considered inhibitors of SLC38A9 while compounds that lead to greater membrane depolarization are considered SLC38A9 agonists. G. Whole-cell Patch clamping: Transport of amino acids and sodium by SLC38A9 may generate an electrical current that can be detected by whole cell patch clamping. Neurons or cells overexpressing SLC38A9 or SLC38A9 Δ1 10 at the plasma membrane are first starved for amino acids before being subjected to whole cell patch clamping with borosilicate glass recording pipettes (3-5 μΜ). External and internal solutions are formulated to be compatible with recording currents from sodium-dependent amino acid transporters of the SLC38 family as described in the art (The Journal of Biological Chemistry 284, 1 1224-1 1236, 2009). The frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) are recorded under voltage clamp (at a holding potential of -70 mV) in the presence or absence test compound and the presence or absence of amino acid substrate in the external solution. Compounds that subsequently decrease frequency or amplitude of excitatory currents are considered inhibitors of SLC38A9 while compounds that increased frequency or amplitude of excitatory currents are considered agonists of SLC38A9. H. Endolysosomal Patch clamping: Direct patching of endolysosomes isolated from cells expressing wild-type SLC38A9 or SLC38A9 Δ1 10 fused to a fluorescent protein, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), is employed as described in the art (Cell. 152(4): 778-790, 2013). Briefly cells expressing SLC38A9 or SLC38A9 Δ1 10 fused to a fluorescent protein are cut at the plasma membrane and lysosomes, identified by their fluorescent staining of SLC38A9 or SLC38A9 Δ1 10 are pushed out for patch clamp recordings. Cytosolic and luminal buffers are formulated according to the art for measuring activity of other SLC38A family members (Cell. 152(4): 778-790, 2013) and excitatory recordings are taken in the presence or absence of SLC38A9 substrates and in the presence or absence of test compounds. Test compounds that modulate excitatory signals from the clamp are considered modulators of SCL38A9. I. Oocyte-based transporter assays: Xenopus oocytes are isolated and microinjected according to the art (J. Biol. Chem. 286:20500-2051 1 , 201 1 ) with in vitro transcribed niRNA. corresponding to a plasma-membrane directed form of SLC38A9, SLC38A9 Δ1 10 or a control protein. Resulting oocytes are placed into wells of a 96-well plate, incubated with Krebs- Ringer HEPES (KRH) buffer. The oocytes are incubated with test compounds added ■ 3 prior to or simultaneously with a combination of unlabeled and H-labeled amino-acid substrate and sodium chloride for 1 hour at 30°C before termination of the assay with the addition of cold KRH buffer (J. Biol. Chem. 286:20500-2051 1 , 201 1). After termination, cells are lysed in 10% SDS and transferred to a scintillation tube for quantification of radiolabeled amino acid uptake. Compounds that inhibited uptake of H-substrates are considered inhibitors of SLC38A9 while compounds that increased uptake of 3H-substrates are considered SLC38A9 agonists J. Scintillation Proximity Assay: Binding of radiolabeled amino acid substrates to SLC38A9 or SLC38A9 Δ1 10 is measured using a Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA). Briefly, N-terminal His- tagged SLC38A9 or N-terminal His-tagged SLC38A9 Δ1 10 is immobilized onto copper chelate fluoromicrosphere beads containing scintillate. The radiolabeled substrate binding assay is then performed with this protein/bead complex plus appropriate controls as described in the art (Nature Protocols, 7:9, 1569-1578, 2012). Test compounds are added prior to or simultaneously with radiolabeled substrates. Compounds that decrease the scintillate count are considered inhibitors of SLC38A9 while compounds that increased binding of the radiolabeled substrate are considered SLC38A9 agonists. K. Nanodisc based direct binding assays: SLC38A9 or SLC38A9 Δ1 10 are assembled into Nanodiscs as described in the art (FEBS Lett. 584(9): 1721 -7, 2010). Once assembled into Nanodiscs, the polypeptide become amenable to a wide range of biophysical assays measuring direct binding of small molecules and amino acid substrates including: 1. Solid phase surface plasmon resonance. Nanodiscs containing SLC38A9 or SLC38A9 Δ1 10 are immobilized onto a matrix plate either via direct amine coupling or through an avidity tag fused to the Nanodisc or the N-terminus of SLC38A9 or SLC38A9 Δ1 10. Once immobilized, small molecule binding is measured as described previously (Analytical Biochemistry 408, 46 - 52, 201 1). 2. Solution phase measurement of small molecule binding. Nanodisc containing N-terminal epitope tagged SLC38A9 or SLC38A9 Δ1 10 are incubated with test compounds for a period of time. The Nanodisc containing protein is immunoprecipitated, and the small molecules remaining in solution are subjected to analysis via mass spectrometry. This allows detection and identification of small molecules that are depleted upon incubation with Nanodiscs containing SLC38A9, but not negative control proteins. The degree of compound depletion from the solution is correlated to test compound affinity to protein.
