Examples of the area where a pest lives include crops and soil where crops are grown. [0023] The pest control method of the present invention can be carried out by applying the pest control composition of the present, invention to a pest or an area where a pest lives. The pest control method of the present invention can be also carried out by applying etoxazole and fenazaquin separately to a pest or an area where a pest lives. [0024] In the pest control method of the present invention, the weight ratio of etoxazole to fenazaquin is, for example, from 5000:1 to 1:5000, from 500:1 to 1:5000, from 300:1 to 1:4100, from 250:1 to 1:4097, from 100:1 to 1:100, from 16:1 to 1:16 and. from 1:3 to 1:16. [0025] In the pest control method of the present invention, application of etoxazole and fenazaquin can be carried out by, for example, spraying the foliage of crops with etoxazole and fenazaquin, irrigating soil where crops are grown with etoxazole and fenazaquin, or treating the seeds of crops with etoxazole and fenazaquin. [0026] When etoxazole and fenazaquin are applied to the foliage of crops or the soil where crops are grown, the application rate is generally from 0.1 to 1000 g per 10000 m2, preferably from 1 to 200 g per 10000 m2, in terms of the total amount of etoxazole and fenazaquin, although it may be varied depending on the kinds of crops to be protected from pests, the kinds of target pests, the population size of target pests, the type of a formulation, the application period, and climate conditions. [0027] When the seeds of crops are treated with etoxazole and fenazaquin, the treatment rate is generally from 0.001 to 20 g, preferably from 0.01 to 10 g per 1 kg of seeds, in terms of the total amount of etoxazole and fenazaquin. [0028] When etoxazole and fenazaquin are formulated into emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder or suspension concentrate, the formulation is generally diluted with water and then sprayed. In this case, the formulation is diluted so that the total concentration of etoxazole and fenazaquin becomes generally from 1 to 10000 ppm, preferably from 10 to 500 ppm. When etoxazole and fenazaquin are formulated into dusts or granules, the formulation is generally applied as it is without diluting it.

[0043] Test Example 1 Kidney beans (Nagauzura saitou) were planted (one plant per container) in plastic containers (volume: 90 ml) and grown until the primary leaves had fully expanded. Only one leaf of each kidney bean plant was left on the plant and all the other leaves were removed from the plant. Then, 5 adults of Tetranychus urticae were released on each leaf . A suspension concentrate containing 10.0% by weight of etoxazole [product name: Baroque (registered trademark) flowable, manufactured by Kyoyu Agri Co., Ltd.] was diluted with water containing 0.02% by volume of a spreading agent [product name: Sindain (registered trademark), manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.] so that the concentration of etoxazole became 12.5 ppm. A reference standard containing 99.9% by weight of fenazaquin was diluted with water containing 0.02% by volume of a spreading agent [product name: Sindain (registered trademark), manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.] so that the concentration of fenazaquin became 50 ppm. The water dilution of etoxazole, the water dilution of fenazaquin, and water containing 0.02% by volume of a spreading agent [product name: Sindain (registered trademark), manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.] were mixed to prepare a test solution with a predetermined concentration of etoxazole and fenazaquin. Three days after the release of the insects, each test solution was sprayed onto the leaves of kidney bean plants and the leaves were air-dried. Two days after the treatment, the tested insects were observed for life or death. An insect death rate was calculated according to the following equation. For each treatment there are duplicates. Results are shown in Table 1. Insect death rate (%) = 100 χ (number of dead insects / number of tested insects) Table 1 Etoxazole Fenazaquin Insect death rate (%) Concentration (ppm) Concentration (ppm) 0.000781 - 10 - 3.2 40 0.000781 3.2 90 [0044] [0045] Test Example 2 Kidney beans (Nagauzura saitou) were planted (one plant per container) in plastic containers (volume: 90 ml) and grown until the primary leaves had fully expanded.

Four days after the release of the insects, each test solution was sprayed onto the leaves of kidney bean plants and the leaves were air-dried. Three days after the treatment, the tested insects were observed for life or death. An insect death rate was calculated according to the following equation; For each treatment . there are duplicates. Results are shown in Table 2. Insect death rate (%) = 100 χ (number of dead insects / number of tested insects) Table 2 Etoxazole Fenazaquin Insect death rate (%) Concentration (ppm) Concentration (ppm) 0.8 15 - 3.2 40 - 12.5 50 0.8 3.2 60 0.8 12.5 95 [0046] [0047] Test Example 3 Cabbages (Green ball) were planted (one plant per container) in plastic containers (volume: 90 ml) and grown until the third to fourth leaf stage. Only one leaf of each cabbage plant was left on the plant and all the other leaves were removed from the plant. The plastic containers were put into a net cage containing a lot of living Bemisia tabaci and allowed to stand for 24 hours. After that, the plastic containers were taken out from the cage and the number of living insects (Bemisia tabaci) on the cabbage seedlings was determined (This is called the "number of insects before treatment"). A suspension concentrate containing 10.0% by weight of etoxazole [product name: Baroque (registered trademark) flowable, manufactured by Kyoyu Agri Co., Ltd.] was diluted with water containing 0.02% by volume of a spreading agent [product name: Sindain (registered trademark), manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co.,- Ltd.] so that the concentration of etoxazole became 800 ppm. A reference standard containing 99.9% by weight of fenazaquin was diluted with water containing 0.02% by volume of a spreading agent [product name: Sindain (registered trademark), manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.] so that the concentration of fenazaquin became 50 ppm. The water dilution of etoxazole, the water dilution of fenazaquin, and water containing 0.02% by volume of a spreading agent [product name: Sindain (registered trademark), manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.] were mixed to.prepare a test solution with a predetermined concentration of etoxazole and/or fenazaquin. Then, each test solution was sprayed onto the plastic containers to sufficiently soak cabbage seedlings, and allowed to stand for room temperature (about 25°C) . Two days after the treatment, the number of living insects (Bemisia tabaci) on the cabbage seedlings was determined (This is called the "number of insects after treatment"). An insect death rate was calculated according to the following equation. For each treatment there are duplicates. Results are shown in Table 3.
