CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The instant application claims priority benefit to co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/987,133 entitled “Stabilizer Compositions for Stabilizing Materials Against Ultraviolet Light and Thermal Degradation” filed on May 1, 2014, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF INVENTION The instant invention relates to stabilizing compositions. In particular, the instant invention relates to compositions that stabilize materials against ultraviolet light degradation and thermal degradation. BACKGROUND Exposure to sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation (also referred to as UV light) is known to cause degradation of a wide variety of materials. For example, polymeric materials such as plastics often discolor, lose gloss and/or become brittle as a result of prolonged exposure to UV light due primarily to a reduction in the molecular weight of the polymer. Accordingly, a large body of art has been developed directed towards compositions such as UV light absorbers and stabilizers, which are capable of inhibiting such degradation in polymeric articles. Exposure to heat is also known to cause degradation of materials, especially polymeric materials. While compositions that reduce or prevent degradation caused by heat have been developed, combining these compositions with UV light stabilizer systems has not always yielded the desired result since the UV light stabilization properties are often hindered or completely relinquished (i.e., antagonistic) when combined with the heat stabilizer composition(s). Accordingly, there remains an unmet need in the market for a stabilizer composition that can protect materials from degradation due to both UV light and thermal exposure. This invention is believed to be an answer to the foregoing need. SUMMARY In one aspect, the invention is directed to thermal and ultraviolet (UV) light stabilizing compositions that include an ortho-hydroxyl tris-aryl-s-triazine compound; a hindered amine light stabilizer compound; a hindered hydroxybenzoate compound; an acid scavenger; a phosphite compound; and a hindered phenol antioxidant compound. Another aspect of the invention is directed to thermal and ultraviolet (UV) light stabilizing compositions that include an ortho-hydroxyl tris-aryl-s-triazine compound; a hindered amine light stabilizer compound; a hindered hydroxybenzoate compound; a phosphite compound, and an acid scavenger or a thioester. In another aspect, the invention is directed to stabilized compositions that include any of the thermal and UV light stabilizing compositions described herein and a material to be stabilized. In a further aspect, the invention is directed to processes for preparing the aforementioned stabilized composition wherein the material to be stabilized is combined with any of the thermal and UV light stabilizing compositions described herein. In yet a further aspect, the invention is directed to a process for improving processability of a material selected from the group consisting of polyolefins, polyesters, polyethers, polyketones, polyamides, natural and synthetic rubbers, polyurethanes, polystyrenes, high-impact polystyrenes, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyacetals, polyacrylonitriles, polybutadienes, polystyrenes, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, styrene acrylonitrile, acrylate styrene acrylonitrile, cellulosic acetate butyrate, cellulosic polymers, polyimides, polyamideimides, polyetherimides, polyphenylsulfides, polyphenyloxidepolysulfones, polyethersulfones, polyvinylchlorides, polycarbonates, polyketones, aliphatic polyketones, thermoplastic olefins, aminoresin cross-linked polyacrylates and polyesters, polyisocyanate cross-linked polyesters and polyacrylates, phenol/formaldehyde, urea/formaldehyde and melamine/formaldehyde resins, drying and non-drying alkyd resins, alkyd resins, polyester resins, acrylate resins cross-linked with melamine resins, urea resins, isocyanates, isocyanurates, carbamates, and epoxy resins, cross-linked epoxy resins derived from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, heterocyclic and aromatic glycidyl compounds, which are cross-linked with anhydrides or amines, polysiloxanes, Michael addition polymers, amines, blocked amines with activated unsaturated and methylene compounds, ketimines with activated unsaturated and methylene compounds, polyketimines in combination with unsaturated acrylic polyacetoacetate resins, polyketimines in combination with unsaturated acrylic resins, radiation curable compositions, epoxymelamine resins, organic dyes, cosmetic products, cellulose-based paper formulations, photographic film paper, fibers, waxes, inks, and blends thereof, the process comprising adding a stabilizing amount of a stabilizing composition as described herein to the material.

Furthermore, the processes and compositions disclosed herein additionally (and surprisingly) provide a stabilizer package that has a low release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), low odor and low blooming as compared to current commercially available polymer stabilizer packages. As employed above and throughout the disclosure, the following terms and definitions are provided to assist the reader. Unless otherwise defined, all terms of art, notations and other scientific terminology used herein are intended to have the meanings commonly understood by those of skill in the chemical arts. As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Additionally, as used herein and in the appended claims, the disclosure of any ranges of amounts or concentrations includes the disclosure of any amount or value in the given range. Throughout this specification the terms and substituents retain their definitions. A comprehensive list of abbreviations utilized by organic chemists (i.e. persons of ordinary skill in the art) appears in the first issue of each volume of the Journal of Organic Chemistry. The list, which is typically presented in a table entitled “Standard List of Abbreviations”, is incorporated herein by reference. The term “hydrocarbyl” is a generic term encompassing aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic groups having an all-carbon backbone and consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms. In certain cases, as defined herein, one or more of the carbon atoms making up the carbon backbone may be replaced or interrupted by a specified atom or group of atoms, such as by one or more heteroatom of N, O, and/or S. Examples of hydrocarbyl groups include alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, carbocyclic aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkylcycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkenylalkyl, and carbocyclic aralkyl, alkaryl, aralkenyl and aralkynyl groups. Such hydrocarbyl groups can also be optionally substituted by one or more substituents as defined herein. Accordingly, the chemical groups or moieties discussed in the specification and claims should be understood to include the substituted or unsubstituted forms. The examples and preferences expressed below also apply to each of the hydrocarbyl substituent groups or hydrocarbyl-containing substituent groups referred to in the various definitions of substituents for compounds of the formulas described herein unless the context indicates otherwise. Preferred non-aromatic hydrocarbyl groups are saturated groups such as alkyl and cycloalkyl groups. Generally, and by way of example, the hydrocarbyl groups can have up to fifty carbon atoms, unless the context requires otherwise. Hydrocarbyl groups with from 1 to 30 carbon atoms are preferred. Within the sub-set of hydrocarbyl groups having 1 to 30 carbon atoms, particular examples are C1-20 hydrocarbyl groups, such as C1-12 hydrocarbyl groups (e.g. C1-6 hydrocarbyl groups or C1-14 hydrocarbyl groups), specific examples being any individual value or combination of values selected from C1 through C30 hydrocarbyl groups. Alkyl is intended to include linear, branched, or cyclic hydrocarbon structures and combinations thereof. Lower alkyl refers to alkyl groups of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of lower alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, s-and t-butyl and the like. Preferred alkyl groups are those of C30 or below. Alkoxy or alkoxyalkyl refers to groups of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms of a straight, branched, cyclic configuration and combinations thereof attached to the parent structure through an oxygen. Examples include methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, cyclopropyloxy, cyclohexyloxy and the like. Acyl refers to formyl and to groups of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 carbon atoms of a straight, branched, cyclic configuration, saturated, unsaturated and aromatic and combinations thereof, attached to the parent structure through a carbonyl functionality. Examples include acetyl, benzoyl, propionyl, isobutyryl, t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl and the like. Lower-acyl refers to groups containing one to six carbons. References to “carbocyclic” or “cycloalkyl” groups as used herein shall, unless the context indicates otherwise, include both aromatic and non-aromatic ring systems. Thus, for example, the term includes within its scope aromatic, non-aromatic, unsaturated, partially saturated and fully saturated carbocyclic ring systems. In general, such groups may be monocyclic or bicyclic and may contain, for example, 3 to 12 ring members, more usually 5 to 10 ring members. Examples of monocyclic groups are groups containing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 ring members, more usually 3 to 7, and preferably 5 or 6 ring members. Examples of bicyclic groups are those containing 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 ring members, and more usually 9 or 10 ring members. Examples of non-aromatic carbocycle/cycloalkyl groups include c-propyl, c-butyl, c-pentyl, c-hexyl, and the like. Examples of C7 to C10 polycyclic hydrocarbons include ring systems such as norbornyl and adamantyl. Aryl (carbocyclic aryl) refers to a 5- or 6-membered aromatic carbocycle ring containing; a bicyclic 9- or 10-membered aromatic ring system; or a tricyclic 13- or 14-membered aromatic ring system. The aromatic 6- to 14-membered carbocyclic rings include, e.g., substituted or unsubstituted phenyl groups, benzene, naphthalene, indane, tetralin, and fluorene. Substituted hydrocarbyl, alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, etc. refer to the specific substituent wherein up to three H atoms in each residue are replaced with alkyl, halogen, haloalkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, carboxy, carboalkoxy (also referred to as alkoxycarbonyl), carboxamido (also referred to as alkylaminocarbonyl), cyano, carbonyl, nitro, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, mercapto, alkylthio, sulfoxide, sulfone, acylamino, amidino, phenyl, benzyl, halobenzyl, heteroaryl, phenoxy, benzyloxy, heteroaryloxy, benzoyl, halobenzoyl, or lower alkylhydroxy.

The solid mixture is vigorously shaken to achieve uniform mixing of additives. The solid mixture is then fed into the twin screw extruder hopper. The compounding of additives is performed using a Twin Screw extruder. The conditions during compounding are as follows: rotor speed: 130 rpm; melt temperature: 232° C.; feed rate: 800 rpm; temperature profile range: 171-230° C. The average pressure reading during compounding is 36-40%. Compounded samples are pelletized using a Conair pelletizer. The pellets are air dried for 24 hrs. before further use. Sample Preparation: Samples for thermal and weathering tests are prepared using an Arburg injection molder. The conditions during injection molding are as follows: nozzle temperature: 230° C.; injection pressure: 60, shot size: 14.5. For tensile testing, tensile bars according to ASTM638-Type 5 are prepared. Plaques having standard 2×2×0.125 inch dimension are used for both thermal and weathering tests. Thermal and Weathering Test Conditions: For thermal performance, samples (Tensile bars and plaques) are kept at 150° C. for a total of 1000 hrs. Samples are analyzed for gloss retention, Delta E, and mechanical strength (stress at break) at 200 hr. intervals. Surface gloss is measured using micro-TRI-Gloss from BYK-Gardner under ASTM Test Procedure D523 with a 60° angle. The gloss retention value is calculated based on unexposed sample. Change in sample color is measured using a Macbeth Color Eye Colorimeter using ASTM D2244-79 with 1″ view and D65/10° observer. From the raw data, Delta E, which is the difference between total color change before and after exposure, is calculated. Lower Delta E indicates less color change respectively, indicating better performance. For tensile strength, five tensile bars for each data point are tested on an Instron Engineering Company Tensile Tester (Model TTB). The average tensile strength of the five test samples are measured using ASTM D638 type-5 method. The cross-head speed of the tensile tester is 2 inch (0.508 cm.) per minute. For UV weathering, samples are exposed to Xenon Weather-ometer under ASTM-G-155 testing conditions, PV1303, SAEJ1885 (J2412) and SAEJ1960 (J2527). Samples are analyzed for gloss retention and Delta E after set exposure interval. Thirteen samples with various stabilizer additive combinations are formulated as described above and then tested for extreme thermal performance (tensile strength, gloss and color change) and extreme weathering performance (gloss and color change) against a control sample (no stabilizer composition added). Those samples denoted by a “C” are comparative and represent control samples (i.e., no stabilizing compositions added), or samples containing formulations previously known to those skilled in the art. Example 2C, for example, is based on a formulation described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,843,939. Results of the thermal and weathering tests for the samples as prepared above are presented in Tables 2-5 below.

This result is also visually demonstrated by FIGS. 1A-1E. Plaques with no stabilizer composition (FIG. 1A) or with stabilizer composition based on U.S. Pat. No. 6,843,939 (FIG. 1B) show blooming under extreme thermal conditions, whereas plaques with stabilizing compositions according to the invention as described herein (FIGS. 1C, 1D, and 1E) show significantly less, or no blooming under the same conditions.

Thus, based on the results above, it is surprisingly shown that compositions according to the invention as described herein not only display a synergistic effect and provide enhanced thermal performance in terms of retaining tensile strength under extreme conditions as compared to control samples and samples containing formulations known to those skilled in the art, but the compositions according to the invention as described herein also do not have any antagonistic effect against the good weathering performance demonstrated by samples containing formulations known to those skilled in the art. EXAMPLES 15-19 Multipass Processing Stabilization Study In Examples 15-19, the additives listed in Table 1 are utilized to conduct a multipass processing stabilization study. Melt Mixing of Polymer Additives: First, the additives are weighed and mixed with polypropylene (Profax 6301) resin. The solid mixture is vigorously shaken to achieve uniform mixing of additives. The solid mixture is fed into the single screw extruder hopper. The compounding of additives is performed using a single screw extruder. The conditions during compounding are as follows: rotor speed: 100 rpm; melt temperature: 230° C.; feed rate: 70-100 rpm; temperature profile range: 215-230° C. The average pressure reading during compounding is 36-40%. Compounded samples are pelletized using a Conair pelletizer. Multipass Extrusion Processing: The pellets are passed through the single screw extruder five times and about 200 g of sample are collected from the first, third, and fifth passes. To determine the processing characteristics, the relative melt flow of the compounded polypropylene pellets are measured using the Dynisco Melt Flow Indexer (MFI). This procedure is specific for ASTM D1238 Method B—Automatically Timed Flow Rate Measurement. A lower Melt flow rate (MFR—g/10 min) indicates higher viscosity properties, demonstrating better stability performance of the polymer. The results are shown in Table 6 below as well as in a graph presented in FIG. 2.
