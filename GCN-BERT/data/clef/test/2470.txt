Example 10: Preparation of (2S,5R)-7-oxo-2-(spiro[3.3]heptan-2-ylcarbamoyl)-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate (Compound 10)
(1) Preparation of spiro[3.3]heptan-2-ol
Spiro[3.3]heptan-2-one (1.1 g, 10 mmol) was added in methanol (50 mL), cooled with ice-bath, sodium borohydride (418 mg, 11 mmol) was slowly added in batches, then heated to 25Â°C and reacted for 2h. After completion of the reaction, vacuum concentration was performed, ethyl acetate (100 mL) was added, washed sequentially with water (30 mL) and saturated brine (30 mL), the organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated in vacuum to obtain colorless oil product (962 mg, yield 85.9%).
