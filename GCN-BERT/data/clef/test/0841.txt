Example 115
6-{[4-(2,3-Dihydroxypropyl)-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]methyl}-3-ethyl-5-methyl-1-[2-(trifluoromethoxy)ethyl]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (racemate)
To a solution of 10 mg (0.022 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 111 in 220 μl of acetone were added 3.8 mg (0.033 mmol) of N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) and 4 μl (0.001 mmol) of osmium tetroxide solution (4% in water), and the mixture was stirred at RT for about 18 h. Then about 100 μl each of sodium thiosulphate solution (20% in water) and 1 M hydrochloric acid solution were added. Undissolved material was filtered off and the filtrate was separated into its components by means of preparative HPLC (Method 12). Concentration of the product fraction and drying under high vacuum gave 7 mg (65% of theory) of the title compound (500 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ/ppm): 7.85 (s, 1H), 4.99 (s, 2H), 4.41-4.36 (m, 2H), 4.18 (t, 2H), 3.90 (q, 2H), 3.71 (dd, 1H), 3.67-3.60 (m, 1H), 3.43 (dd, 2H), 2.47 (s, 3H), 1.11 (t, 3H) [further signals are concealed by the water signal].
