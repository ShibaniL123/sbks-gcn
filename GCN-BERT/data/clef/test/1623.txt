Patent Cooperation Treaty International Application Cosmetic Dispenser with Dual Dispensing Mechanisms CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION [0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/948,426, filed March 5, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD [0002] The present invention relates generally to cosmetic dispensers. Stated more particularly, disclosed herein is a cosmetic dispenser with dual dispensing mechanisms for selectively and independently dispensing first and second cosmetics in an efficient and compact construction. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] In a typical prior art dispenser of a cosmetic pomade, an elevator cup retains a pomade of cosmetic, such as lipstick, for axial extension and retraction by a swiveling of a base portion in relation to a body portion of the dispenser. Dispensers have commonly employed a cam member with helical threads formed therealong that is rotatably associated with a tubular innerbody. The innerbody is normally formed with opposed longitudinal tracks. The elevator cup typically has opposed lugs that are received through the longitudinal tracks to engage the helical threads of the cam member. Under this arrangement, a rotation of the cam member in relation to the tubular innerbody induces the desired axial movement of the elevator cup and the retained lipstick pomade as the lugs of the elevator cup slide helically along the helical threads and longitudinally along the longitudinal tracks. [0004] Prior art inventors have also proposed arrangements for extending and retracting first and second cosmetics, such as lipstick pomades, in a double-ended configuration. However, it is recognized that a significant multiplicity of components have been necessary to extend and retract first and second cosmetics under prior art constructions. Moreover, the number of components required in prior art double-ended dispensers and their necessary dispositions and relationships have typically produced double-ended cosmetic dispensers that are undesirably bulky and unwieldy. [0005] With a knowledge of the state of the art as summarized above, the present inventor has appreciated that there is a need for a double-ended cosmetic dispenser that is operative to extend and retract first and second cosmetics independently with a reduced number of required components and that is capable of achieving a more efficient, compact, and manageable construction. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] The present invention has as its most broadly stated object the providing of a cosmetic dispenser with dual dispensing mechanisms for independently extending and retracting first and second cosmetics, such as cosmetic pomades. [0007] A more particular object of embodiments of the invention is to provide a cosmetic dispenser with dual dispensing mechanisms that represents an advance and improvement over prior art double-ended cosmetic dispensers by reducing necessary components while providing concomitant improvements in design and operational efficiencies. [0008] Another object of the invention is to provide a cosmetic dispenser with dual dispensing mechanisms wherein first and second cosmetics can be extended and retracted independently. [0009] Still another object of embodiments of the invention is to provide a cosmetic dispenser with dual dispensing mechanisms that conserves materials and is relatively efficient in construction, assembly, and operation. [0010] These and further objects and advantages of embodiments of the invention will become obvious not only to one who reviews the present specification and drawings but also to one who has an opportunity to make use of an embodiment of the cosmetic dispenser with dual dispensing mechanisms disclosed herein. It will be appreciated, however, that, although the accomplishment of each of the foregoing objects in a single embodiment of the invention may be possible and indeed preferred, not all embodiments will seek or need to accomplish each and every potential object and advantage. Nonetheless, all such embodiments should be considered within the scope of the invention. [0011] The cosmetic dispenser has dual dispensing mechanisms for independently extending and retracting first and second cosmetics. In one embodiment, the cosmetic dispenser has a bi- directional body structure with a central hub, a first body member with a body portion that projects from the hub in a first direction, and a second body member with a body portion that projects from the hub in a second direction. A first spiral member has a body portion matingly and rotatably engaged with the body portion of the first body member with a longitudinal axis of relative rotation, and a second spiral member has a body portion matingly and rotatably engaged with the body portion of the second body member with a longitudinal axis of relative rotation wherein. Each of the first and second spiral members has at least one spiral formation along the body portion thereof. A first elevator member is received within the first body member, and a second elevator member is received within the second body member. Each elevator member has at least one projection that engages the at least one spiral formation of the respective spiral member. Under this construction, the first and second elevator members, each potentially retaining a cosmetic applicator or a cosmetic directly, are independently extendable and retractable by a relative rotation between the respective spiral member and body member. [0012] In certain manifestations of the invention, the bi-directional body structure can be a bidirectional inner body structure. There, the first body member can be a first inner body member, and the second body member can be a second inner body member. With that, the first spiral member can matingly receive the first inner body member, and the second spiral member can matingly receive the second inner body member. [0013] The first inner body can have at least one longitudinal track that communicates along a substantial length of the first inner body member for receiving the at least one projection from the body portion of the first elevator member. Similarly, the second inner body member can have at least one longitudinal track that communicates along a substantial length of the second inner body member for receiving the at least one projection from the body portion of the second elevator member. [0014] While the components could be separate within the scope of the invention, the central hub, the first body member, and the second body member of the bi-directional body structure can be formed as a unitary component. Whether the components are separate or unitary, the first and second body members of the bi-directional body structure can project oppositely and in longitudinal alignment. [0015] In particular embodiments of the cosmetic dispenser, the first and second body members can have opposed longitudinal tracks, and the first and second spiral members can have opposed spiral channels. Under such constructions, the first and second elevator members can have lugs projecting oppositely to be received through the longitudinal tracks and into the opposed spiral channels of the first and second body members and the first and second spiral members respectively. [0016] Where the bi-directional body structure comprises a bi-directional inner body structure, the first body member can be a first inner body member with a tubular body portion with a distally disposed peripheral annular ridge and a proximally disposed annular base portion, and the second body member can be a second inner body member with a tubular body portion with a distally disposed peripheral annular ridge and a proximally disposed annular base portion. With that, the first spiral member can matingly receive the first inner body member, and the second spiral member can matingly receive the second inner body member. [0017] A removable and replaceable first end cap can selectively enshroud the first body member, the first spiral member, and any retained cosmetic or cosmetic applicator. Also, a removable and replaceable second end cap can selectively enshroud the second body member, the second spiral member, and any retained cosmetic or cosmetic applicator. [0018] While it will be recognized that the first and second elevator members will vary depending on the cosmetic or cosmetic applicator to be extended and retracted, the first and second elevator members could take the form of first and second elevator cups. In such embodiments, a first pomade of cosmetic can be retained by the first elevator cup and a second pomade of cosmetic can be retained by the second elevator cup. [0019] Embodiments of the invention for a cosmetic dispenser with dual dispensing mechanisms for independently extending and retracting first and second cosmetics can alternatively be considered to include a bi-directional inner body structure with a central hub, a first inner body member with a body portion that projects from the hub in a first direction, and a second inner body member with a body portion that projects from the hub in a second direction. A first outer body member can have a body portion matingly and rotatably engaged with the body portion of the first inner body member with a longitudinal axis of relative rotation, and a second outer body member can have a body portion matingly and rotatably engaged with the body portion of the second inner body member with a longitudinal axis of relative rotation. A first elevator member is received within the first inner body member, and a second elevator member is received within the second inner body member. A first rotary extension and retraction mechanism enables the first elevator member to be manipulated between an extended configuration and a retracted configuration by a selective rotation of the first outer body member relative to the first inner body member to yield an axial movement of the first elevator member, and a second rotary extension and retraction mechanism enables the second elevator member to be manipulated between an extended configuration and a retracted configuration by a selective rotation of the second outer body member relative to the second inner body member to yield an axial movement of the second elevator member. [0020] In certain embodiments, the inner bodies, the outer bodies, and the elevator members can in cooperation act as the first and second rotary extension and retraction mechanisms. For instance, the first inner body member can have at least one longitudinal track that communicates along a substantial length of the body portion. The first elevator member can have a body portion and at least one projection from the body portion, and the first outer body member can comprise a first spiral member with at least one spiral formation along an inner surface of the body portion for engaging the at least one projection from the body portion of the first elevator member whereby the first inner body, the first outer body, and the first elevator member in cooperation act as the first rotary extension and retraction mechanism. Similarly, the second inner body member can have at least one longitudinal track that communicates along a substantial length of the body portion, the second elevator member can have a body portion and at least one projection from the body portion, and the second outer body member can comprise a second spiral member with at least one spiral formation along an inner surface of the body portion for engaging the at least one proj ection from the body portion of the second elevator member whereby the second inner body, the second outer body, and the second elevator member in cooperation act as the second rotary extension and retraction mechanism. [0021] Other rotary extension and retraction mechanisms are possible and within the scope of the invention except as it might be expressly limited by the claims. By way of example and not limitation, the respective inner bodies, outer bodies, and elevator members could also cooperate to act as a rotary extension and retraction mechanism through a threaded stem for the elevator member in combination with threaded apertures retained, for instance, relative to the inner bodies or the outer bodies. With a threaded engagement between the stem and the inner bodies or the outer bodies, the elevator members can be selectively extended or retracted by a relative rotation of the respective inner body and the outer body. [0022] One will appreciate that the foregoing discussion broadly outlines the more important features of the invention merely to enable a better understanding of the detailed description that follows and to instill a better appreciation of the inventor's contribution to the art. Before an embodiment of the invention is explained in detail, it must be made clear that the following details of construction, descriptions of geometry, and illustrations of inventive concepts are mere examples of the many possible manifestations of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0033] The cosmetic dispenser with dual dispensing mechanisms disclosed herein is subject to varied embodiments, each within the scope of the invention. However, to ensure that one skilled in the art will be able to understand and, in appropriate cases, practice the present invention, certain preferred embodiments of the broader invention revealed herein are described below and shown in the accompanying drawing figures. [0034] With this in mind and looking more particularly to the accompanying figures, an exemplary embodiment of a cosmetic dispenser with dual dispensing mechanisms pursuant to the present invention is indicated generally at 10 in FIGS. 1 and 2. There, the cosmetic dispenser 10 can be seen to be founded on a bi-directional inner body structure 12, which is shown apart in FIGS. 3 and 4. [0035] As FIGS. 3 and 4 show, the inner body structure 12 has a hub 30 disposed at a mid- portion thereof. A first tubular inner body member 36 projects from the hub 30 in a first direction, and a second tubular inner body member 48 projects from the hub 30 in a second direction. In this embodiment, the first and second inner body members 36 and 48 project longitudinally in opposite directions. [0036] The central hub 30, the first tubular body member 36, and the second tubular inner body member 48 of the bi-directional inner body structure 12 are formed as a unit in this example of the cosmetic dispenser 10. The inner body structure 12 could, by way of example and not limitation, be formed unitarily as a single component. For instance, the central hub 30, the first tubular body member 36, and the second tubular inner body member 48, which together form the inner body structure 12, could be molded, printed, or otherwise formed as a unitary structure. [0037] The first inner body member 36 has a tubular body portion with a distally disposed peripheral annular ridge 45 and a proximally disposed annular base portion 32. Similarly, the second inner body member 48 has a tubular body with a distally disposed annular ridge 47 and a proximally disposed annular base portion 44. Under this configuration, a first spiral member 14 can be received over the body portion of the first inner body member 36 with a proximal end retained against proximal longitudinal movement by the annular base portion 32 and a distal end retained against distal longitudinal movement by the annular ridge 45. A second spiral member 24 can be received over the body portion of the second inner body member 48 with a proximal end retained against proximal longitudinal movement by the annular base portion 44 and a distal end retained against distal longitudinal movement by the annular ridge 47. The body portion of each inner body member 36 and 48 has an outer diameter slightly less than the inner diameter of the body portion of the respective spiral member 14 and 24. The first and second spiral members 14 and 24 are independently and selectively rotatable in relation to the inner body structure 12 to produce a selective extension and retraction of first and second elevator cups 20 and 22 respectively as discussed further hereinbelow. [0038] The first inner body member 36 has first and second opposed longitudinal tracks 38 that communicate along a substantial length of the body portion of the inner body member 36. The longitudinal tracks 38 are disposed in general opposition and pass entirely through the body portion. With this, elevator lugs 76 that project radially from a peripheral wall 74 of a first elevator cup 20, which is shown with a second elevator cup 22 apart from the remainder of the cosmetic dispenser 10 in FIGS. 8 and 9, can pass through the longitudinal tracks 38 to engage opposed spiral formations 60 in the body portion 58 of the first spiral member 14, which is seen, for instance, in FIGS. 5 and 6. A first longitudinal track 38 can have closed proximal and distal ends while a second longitudinal track 38 can have a closed proximal end and an opening at the distal end thereof for enabling a receipt of the elevator lugs 76 of the elevator cup 20 and for enabling a radial compression of the body portion of the inner body member 36 during an insertion of the body portion of the inner body member 36 into the body portion 58 of the first spiral member 14. [0039] The spiral formations 60 in this example comprise helical or spiral channels 60, communicating therealong. It will be noted that, although spiral channels 60 are depicted in the instant embodiment, the spiral formations 60 alternatively could comprise spiral threads, spiral ridges, or any other spiral or helical arrangement. In any case, first and second spiral channels 60 or other spiral formations can be disposed in general opposition to one another thereby to enable a receipt and engagement of the opposed elevator lugs 76 of the elevator cup 20. [0040] The first and second longitudinal tracks 38 can have distal lateral track segments 42 at the distal ends thereof and proximal lateral track segments 40 at the proximal ends thereof. The distal lateral track segments 42 can be employed to lock the first elevator cup 20 in an extended disposition, and the proximal lateral track segments 40 can lock the elevator cup 20 in a retracted disposition. With this, inadvertent movement, namely unintended extension or retraction, of the elevator cup 20 and the retained pomade can be prevented. [0041] In a similar manner, the second inner body member 48 has first and second opposed longitudinal tracks 50 that communicate along a substantial length of the body portion of the inner body member 48 and are disposed in general opposition and pass entirely through the body portion. With this, elevator lugs 76 that project radially from a peripheral wall 74 of the second elevator cup 22 can pass through the longitudinal tracks 50 to engage opposed spiral formations 64 in the body portion 62 of the second spiral member 24, which is seen, for instance, in FIGS. 5 and 6. A first longitudinal track 50 can have closed proximal and distal ends while a second longitudinal track 50 can have a closed proximal end and an opening at the distal end thereof for enabling a receipt of the elevator lugs 76 of the elevator cup 22 and for enabling a radial compression of the body portion of the inner body member 48 during an insertion of the body portion of the inner body member 48 into the body portion 62 of the second spiral member 24. [0042] Again, the spiral formations 64 in this example comprise helical or spiral channels 64, communicating therealong. It will be noted that, although spiral channels 64 are depicted in the instant embodiment, the spiral formations 64 alternatively could comprise spiral threads, spiral ridges, or any other spiral or helical arrangement. In any case, first and second spiral channels 64 or other spiral formations can be disposed in general opposition to one another thereby to enable a receipt and engagement of the opposed elevator lugs 76 of the elevator cup 22. [0043] The first and second longitudinal tracks 50 can have distal lateral track segments 54 at the distal ends thereof and proximal lateral track segments 52 at the proximal ends thereof. The distal lateral track segments 54 can be employed to lock the second elevator cup 22 in an extended disposition, and the proximal lateral track segments 52 can lock the elevator cup 22 in a retracted disposition. With this, inadvertent movement, namely unintended extension or retraction, of the elevator cup 22 and the retained pomade can be prevented. [0044] Looking more particularly to the first and second elevator members or cups 20 and 22, each can have an open inner volume for receiving, for instance, a cosmetic pomade 100A and 100B, such as a pomade of lipstick 100A and 100B, as shown in FIG. 2. The open inner volume can be defined by the peripheral wall 74 together with a floor 78. Retention of the pomades 100 A and 100B against longitudinal and rotational displacement can be provided by a plurality of ribs or fins 80 that project radially inwardly from the peripheral walls 74. In practice, the fins 80 can establish an effective diameter less than the effective diameter of the cosmetic pomades 100A and 100B such that the fins 80 can slice into and retain the pomade 100A and 100B against undesirable displacement. Here, the fins 80 are evenly spaced and terminate in smoothly tapered tips for efficiently receiving the cosmetic pomades 100 A and 100B. [0045] As seen, for instance, in FIGS. 1 and 2, a first shell 16 could be disposed to surround the body portions of the first inner body member 36 and the first spiral member 14, and a second shell 26 could be disposed to encase the second inner body member 48 and the second spiral member 24. Where included, the shells 16 and 26 can be merely decorative, or they can additionally be employed to provide structural rigidity and other performance benefits to the cosmetic dispenser 10. [0046] Together, the first elevator cup 20, first inner body member 36, and the first spiral member 14 form a first cosmetic extension and retraction mechanism, and the second elevator cup 22, the second inner body member 48, and the second spiral member 24 form a second cosmetic extension and retraction mechanism. A first tubular end cap 18 can be removably and replaceably disposed to enshroud and protect the first cosmetic extension and retraction mechanism and a retained cosmetic pomade 100A, and a second tubular end cap 28 can be removably and replaceably disposed to enshroud and protect the second cosmetic extension and retraction mechanism and a retained cosmetic pomade 100B. [0047] The end caps 18 and 28 can be retained by any mechanism, including, for instance, a snap-fit engagement, a threaded engagement, a clasp, or any other effective retaining feature. In this example of the invention, one or more protuberances 34 project from the base 32 of the first inner body member 36, and one or more protuberances 46 project from the base 44 of the second inner body member 48 as seen best in FIG. 3. The first cap 18 has an inner peripheral groove 66 adjacent to the proximal end thereof, and the second cap 28 has an inner peripheral groove 68 adjacent to the proximal end thereof. The grooves 66 and 68 are disposed to align with the respective protuberances 34 and 46 when the caps 18 and 28 are disposed to house the first and second extension and retraction mechanisms respectively. With that, the caps 18 and 28 can be retained in a smooth snap-fit engagement. [0048] So constructed, the cosmetic dispenser with dual dispensing mechanisms 10 can be actuated selectively to extend and retract a first cosmetic applicator or cosmetic, such as a cosmetic pomade 100A, in relation to the first extension and retraction mechanism, and the double-ended cosmetic applicator 10 can be actuated selectively to extend and retract a second cosmetic applicator or cosmetic, such as a cosmetic pomade 100B, in relation to the second extension and retraction mechanism. To do so relative to the first extension and retraction mechanism, for instance, a user can produce a relative rotation between the inner body structure 12 and the first spiral member 14 in a first rotational direction to extend the first elevator cup 20 and a retained cosmetic applicator or cosmetic, such as a cosmetic pomade 100A, and in a second rotational direction to retract the first elevator cup 20 and the retained cosmetic applicator or cosmetic, such as a cosmetic pomade 100A. Similarly, the second elevator cup 22 and a retained cosmetic applicator or cosmetic 100B can be extended by producing a relative rotation between the inner body structure 12 and the second spiral member 24 in a first rotational direction, and the second elevator cup 22 and a retained cosmetic applicator or cosmetic 100B can be retracted by producing a relative rotation between the inner body structure 12 and the second spiral member 24 in a second rotational direction. [0049] It will be appreciated that, while the presently depicted embodiment is configured to retain and dispense cosmetic pomades 100A and 100B, such as pomades of lipstick or the like, the disclosed invention could be applied to other cosmetics and cosmetic applicators, such as, but not limited to, mascara applicators, eyeliner applicators and pencils, and other cosmetics and cosmetic applicators. Indeed, the invention could readily be carried forth in relation to articles to be extended and retracted other than cosmetics. [0050] With certain details and embodiments of the present invention for a cosmetic dispenser with dual dispensing mechanisms 10 disclosed, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that numerous changes and additions could be made thereto without deviating from the spirit or scope of the invention. This is particularly true when one bears in mind that the presently preferred embodiments merely exemplify the broader invention revealed herein. Accordingly, it will be clear that those with major features of the invention in mind could craft embodiments that incorporate those major features while not incorporating all of the features included in the preferred embodiments. [0051] Therefore, the following claims shall define the scope of protection to be afforded to the inventor. Those claims shall be deemed to include equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention. It must be further noted that a plurality of the following claims may express certain elements as means for performing a specific function, at times without the recital of structure or material. As the law demands, any such claims shall be construed to cover not only the corresponding structure and material expressly described in this specification but also all equivalents thereof.
