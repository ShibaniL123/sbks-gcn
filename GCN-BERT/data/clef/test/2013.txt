BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Immunotherapies are becoming attractive alternatives to chemotherapies, including immunotherapies that use adoptive transfer of genetically modified T cells to “reteach” the immune system to recognize and eliminate malignant tumor cells. Genetically modified T cells express chimeric antigen receptors, which generally consist of a signaling endodomain, a CD3-zeta transmembrane domain and an extracellular single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a monoclonal antibody which gives the receptor specificity for a tumor-associated antigen on a target malignant cell. Upon binding the tumor-associated antigen via the chimeric antigen receptor, the chimeric antigen receptor expressing T cell (CAR T-cell) mounts an immune response that is cytotoxic to the malignant cell. Such therapies can circumvent chemotherapy resistance and have been shown to be active against relapsed/refractory disease, resulting in sustained remissions for some chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. However, these therapies require further investigation and optimization, as they caused undesirable effects such as toxic lymphophenia, chronic hypogammaglobulinemia for hematological targets, fatal off-target cytolysis for solid tumor targets, persistent B cell aplasia with the use of anti-CD19 antibody expressing CAR T-cells, and, in some cases, death. Introduction of a switch, which controls the activity of the CAR T-cell, would allow CAR T-cell activity and associated immune responses to be turned off after neoplastic cells are eliminated and would allow B cells to reproliferate. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated that CAR T-cell systems can be controlled through an antibody-based switch, wherein the antibody binds the target cell (e.g. cancer cell), blocking the CAR T-cell from binding the target cell and “switching off” CAR-T activity. While these systems conceptually allow for switchable targeting of tumors using CAR T-cells, they may suffer from a series of limitations. Non-specific labeling of antibodies using cysteines or lysines produces heterogeneous products which includes variants that may be non-functional, have unpredictable pharmacokinetics and/or immunogenicity, and that may be difficult to optimize.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Current chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T-cell) therapies can be unreliable due to lack of means to control CAR T-cell activity. Disclosed herein are compositions and methods for selectively activating and deactivating chimeric antigen receptor T cells, which may provide for safer and more versatile immunotherapies than those currently being tested and administered. Disclosed herein are switchable chimeric antigen receptor effector cells (CAR-ECs) and chimeric antigen receptor effector cell (CAR-EC) switches, wherein the CAR-EC switches have a first region that is bound by a chimeric antigen receptor on the CAR-EC and a second region that binds a cell surface molecule on target cell, thereby stimulating an immune response from the CAR-EC that is cytotoxic to the bound target cell. In general, the CAR-EC is a T cell. In this way, the CAR-EC switch may act as an “on-switch” for CAR-EC activity. Activity may be “turned off” by reducing or ceasing administration of the switch. These CAR-EC switches may be used with CAR-ECs disclosed herein, as well as existing CAR T-cells, for the treatment of a disease or condition, such as cancer, wherein the target cell is a malignant cell. Such treatment may be referred to herein as switchable immunotherapy, for which an exemplary schematic overview is depicted in FIG. 1. The CAR-EC switches disclosed herein comprise a first region that binds a cell surface molecule on a target cell, and a second region that is bound by a chimeric antigen receptor. In general the first region is a targeting polypeptide. The targeting polypeptide may be a targeting antibody or antibody fragment that binds an antigen on the target cell. Alternatively or additionally, the first region may comprise a non-peptide small molecule (e.g. vitamin, metabolite). The second region, referred to herein as a chimeric antigen binding peptidic antigen (CAR-BP), comprises a peptide. For simplicity, the term chimeric antigen binding peptidic antigen may simply be referred to herein as a peptidic antigen. In general, the CAR-BP is fused to a terminus of the targeting polypeptide or grafted within the targeting polypeptide. Fusing or grafting the CAR-BP to the targeting polypeptide may be carried out by cloning one or more polynucleotides encoding the first region and the second region into a polynucleotide expression vector, in a desired order or combination. Methods of treating a disease or condition comprising administering the CAR-EC switches, disclosed herein, may provide for a titratable response, improved safety and/or cessation of CAR-EC activity by reducing or ceasing administration of the CAR-EC switch. In contrast to other approaches of controlling CAR-EC activity, which “turn off” CAR-EC activity by competing with the target cell surface molecule for binding the CAR, the CAR-EC switches disclosed herein, generally function as CAR-EC activators or “on” switches. Further disclosed herein are CAR-EC platforms including CAR-EC switches and effector cells comprising universal chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) that can bind multiple CAR-EC switches, providing for sequential targeting of one or more types of target cells (e.g. treatment of heterogeneous tumors). The CAR may comprise an ultra-high affinity antibody or antibody fragment (e.g. scFv) to the switch. Methods of producing the CAR-EC switches disclosed herein may advantageously provide for control of CAR-EC cell activity, titration of off-target reactivity, abrogation of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), attenuation of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and/or optimization of CAR-EC switch binding by affinity, valency, geometry, length and/or chemistry through site-specific grafting/fusing of CAR-EC switch peptides/antibodies. Unless otherwise specified, the terms “switch” and “CAR-EC switch”, as used herein, are used interchangeably and may refer to a peptide switch. The antibody portion of the peptide antibody switch may comprise at least a portion of an antibody or an entire antibody. For example, the antibody portion of the peptide antibody switch may comprise at least a portion of a heavy chain, a portion of a light chain, a portion of a variable region, a portion of a constant region, a portion of a complementarity determining region (CDR), or a combination thereof. The antibody portion of the peptide antibody switch and/or hapten antibody switch may comprise at least a portion of the Fc (fragment, crystallizable) region. The antibody portion of the peptide antibody switch may comprise at least a portion of the complementarity determining region (e.g., CDR1, CDR2, CDR3). The antibody portion of the peptide antibody switch may comprise at least a portion of the Fab (fragment, antigen-binding) region. The peptide switch may be a peptide-Fab switch.

Disclosed herein are chimeric antigen receptor effector cell (CAR-EC) switches comprising a peptidic antigen and a targeting moiety that binds a cell surface molecule on a target cell. Generally, binding of the effector cell and the target cell to the CAR-EC switch construct brings the target cell into proximity with the effector cell sufficiently close for an activity of the effector cell to have an effect on the target cell. For example, when the T cell and the target cell are bound to the CAR-EC switch, the T cell may produce an immune response that has a cytotoxic effect on the target cell. The CAR-EC switches may interact with a plurality of target cells. The target cell may be an infected cell. The target cell may be a pathogenically infected cell. The target cell may be a diseased cell. The target cell may be a genetically-modified cell. The target cell may not be a host cell. The target cell may come from an invading organism (e.g. yeast, worm, bacteria, fungus). Further disclosed herein are CAR-EC switches that interact with a molecule on a non-cell target. The non-cell target may be a virus or a portion thereof. The non-cell target may be a fragment of a cell. The non-cell target may be an extracellular matrix component or protein.

The term “antigen” may also refer to an immunogen. The immunogen may provoke an adaptive immune response if injected on its own into a subject. The immunogen may induce an immune response by itself. The antigen may be a superantigen, T-dependent antigen or a T-independent antigen. The antigen may be an exogenous antigen. Exogenous antigens are typically antigens that have entered the body from the outside, for example by inhalation, ingestion, or injection. Some antigens may start out as exogenous antigens, and later become endogenous (for example, intracellular viruses). The antigen may be an endogenous antigen. The endogenous antigen may be an antigen that has been generated within cells as a result of normal cell metabolism, or because of pathogenic infections (e.g., viral, bacterial, fungal, parasitic). The antigen may be an autoantigen. The autoantigen may be a normal protein or complex of proteins (and sometimes DNA or RNA) that is recognized by the immune system of patients suffering from a specific autoimmune disease. These antigens should, under normal conditions, not be the target of the immune system, but, due to genetic and/or environmental factors, the normal immunological tolerance for such an antigen is not present in these patients. The antigen may be present or over-expressed due to a condition or disease. The condition or disease may be a cancer or a leukemia. The condition may be an inflammatory disease or condition. The condition or disease may be a metabolic disease. The condition may be a genetic disorder. The cell surface molecule may be an antigen that has been designated as a tumor antigen. Tumor antigens or neoantigens may be antigens that are presented by MHC I or MHC II molecules on the surface of tumor cells. These antigens may sometimes be presented by tumor cells and never by the normal ones. In this case, they are called tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) and, in general, result from a tumor-specific mutation. More common are antigens that are presented by tumor cells and normal cells, and they are called tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes that recognize these antigens may be able to destroy the tumor cells before they proliferate or metastasize. Tumor antigens may also be on the surface of the tumor in the form of, for example, a mutated receptor, in which case they may be recognized by B cells. Unless otherwise specified, the terms “tumor antigen,” “tumor specific antigen” and “tumor associated antigen,” are used interchangeably herein. The cell surface molecule may be a receptor.

Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringers' dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's, or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers, such as those based on Ringer's dextrose, and the like. Preservatives and other additives may also be present, such as, for example, anti-microbials, anti-oxidants, chelating agents, inert gases and the like. See generally, Remington's Pharmaceutical Science, 16th Ed., Mack Eds., 1980. Pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be formulated for controlled or sustained delivery in a manner that provides local concentration of the product (e.g., bolus, depot effect) and/or increased stability or half-life in a particular local environment. The compositions may comprise the formulation of CAR-EC switches, polypeptides, nucleic acids, or vectors disclosed herein with particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, etc., as well as agents such as a biodegradable matrix, injectable microspheres, microcapsular particles, microcapsules, bioerodible particles beads, liposomes, and implantable delivery devices that provide for the controlled or sustained release of the active agent which then may be delivered as a depot injection. Techniques for formulating such sustained- or controlled-delivery means are known and a variety of polymers have been developed and used for the controlled release and delivery of drugs. Such polymers are typically biodegradable and biocompatible. Polymer hydrogels, including those formed by complexation of enantiomeric polymer or polypeptide segments, and hydrogels with temperature or pH sensitive properties, may be desirable for providing drug depot effect because of the mild and aqueous conditions involved in trapping bioactive protein agents (e.g., antibodies comprising an ultralong CDR3). See, for example, the description of controlled release porous polymeric microparticles for the delivery of pharmaceutical compositions in WO 93/15722. Suitable materials for this purpose include polylactides (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), polymers of poly-(a-hydroxycarboxylic acids), such as poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988A), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., Biopolymers, 22: 547-556 (1983)), poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (Langer et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res., 15: 167-277 (1981), and Langer, Chem. Tech., 12: 98-105 (1982)), ethylene vinyl acetate, or poly-D(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. Other biodegradable polymers include poly(lactones), poly(acetals), poly(orthoesters), and poly(orthocarbonates). Sustained-release compositions also may include liposomes, which may be prepared by any of several methods known in the art (see, e.g., Eppstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82: 3688-92 (1985)). The carrier itself, or its degradation products, should be nontoxic in the target tissue and should not further aggravate the condition. This may be determined by routine screening in animal models of the target disorder or, if such models are unavailable, in normal animals. Microencapsulation of recombinant proteins for sustained release has been performed successfully with human growth hormone (rhGH), interferon-(rhIFN-), interleukin-2, and MN rgp120.

Ther., 27:1221-1223 (1993); Hora et al., Bio/Technology. 8:755-758 (1990); Cleland, “Design and Production of Single Immunization Vaccines Using Polylactide Polyglycolide Microsphere Systems,” in Vaccine Design: The Subunit and Adjuvant Approach, Powell and Newman, eds, (Plenum Press: New York, 1995), pp. 439-462; WO 97/03692, WO 96/40072, WO 96/07399; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,010. The sustained-release formulations of these proteins were developed using poly-lactic-coglycolic acid (PLGA) polymer due to its biocompatibility and wide range of biodegradable properties. The degradation products of PLGA, lactic and glycolic acids may be cleared quickly within the human body. Moreover, the degradability of this polymer may be depending on its molecular weight and composition. Lewis, “Controlled release of bioactive agents from lactide/glycolide polymer,” in: M.

Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring mucopolysaccharide consisting of residues of D-glucuronic and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Hyaluronic acid is found in the extracellular tissue matrix of vertebrates, including in connective tissues, as well as in synovial fluid and in the vitreous and aqueous humor of the eye. Esterified derivatives of hyaluronic acid have been used to produce microspheres for use in delivery that are biocompatible and biodegradable (see, for example, Cortivo et al., Biomaterials (1991) 12:727-730; EP 517,565; WO 96/29998; Illum et al., J. Controlled Rel. (1994) 29:133-141). Both biodegradable and non-biodegradable polymeric matrices may be used to deliver compositions of the present disclosure, and such polymeric matrices may comprise natural or synthetic polymers. Biodegradable matrices are preferred. The period of time over which release occurs is based on selection of the polymer.

Certain formulations containing CAR-EC switches disclosed herein may be administered orally. Formulations administered in this fashion may be formulated with or without those carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules.

EXAMPLES The following illustrative examples are representative of embodiments of the software applications, systems, and methods described herein and are not meant to be limiting in any way. Example 1 Production and Evaluation of a Switchable CAR-T Platform The solubility, stability, affinity, and potential for cross reactive epitopes in the human proteome of developed antibodies were considered in choosing a CAR-EC switch peptidic antigen. Based on these criteria, a linear amino acid epitope from the yeast transcription factor GCN4 (7P14P) was chosen. Single chain antibodies with affinities varying from 2.6 nM to 5.2 pM enable optimization of the CAR-EC through binding kinetics. Additionally, these antibodies are among the highest affinity anti-peptide single chain antibodies for linear epitopes. The dissociation constant (Kd) for the chosen GCN4 epitope (7P14P) having a sequence of NYHLENEVARLKKL (SEQ ID NO. 3) and GCN4 binding scFv (52SR4) is 5.2 pM. A small hydrophilic target peptide (HTP), based on the commonly used FLAG® tag, was developed. FLAG® has low antigenicity, is highly soluble, and has been fused to numerous proteins with little impact on protein folding or stability. In modifying FLAG to HTP, a proline residue was incorporated after the terminal lysine in an effort to increase proteolytic stability. Antibodies to this epitope are developed by traditional mouse immunization and subsequent humanization or by phage panning of a human library. Binding kinetics of evolved scFv's are fully characterized and peptide-CAR-ECs are created and tested for off-target specificity as described. Evaluation of a Switchable CAR-T Platform in a Xenograft Model To evaluate efficacy, mouse xenograft models are used to compare these switchable platforms to previously developed by CAR-T switch platforms. Towards this end, RS4; 11, NALM-6, Raji or other CD19 positive cell lines are used to establish tumor models in non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID-γ−/−, NSG) mice. CAR-Ts are delivered by intravenous administration. Dose-range finding is carried out for the peptide anti-CD19 switch, and is compared to a wild type CD19 Fab control. Efficacy is judged based on tumor burden and overall survival. Mice are monitored with weekly blood draws to monitor proliferation of CAR-ECs in peripheral blood. Detailed immunophenotypic characterization of CAR-ECs focus on effector, memory, senescent (terminally differentiated), or anergized phenotypes are defined according to standard phenotypic parameters using multi-channel flow cytometry. Efficacy of the Fab, and IgG based switches are delivered at appropriate dosages per observed PK data and compared. IgG is most efficacious in this model for its long residence time in vivo. Further exploration on this idea is carried out in the syngeneic model. Primary patient-derived ALL or CLL samples are obtained and for generating xenograft models in NSG mice. Primary samples are characterized for CD19 expression by flow cytometry. Leukemia is established in mice for 2-3 weeks prior to administration of therapy. Efficacy versus CAR-T-19 is judged by monitoring CD19+ ALL blast counts in peripheral blood. In the event that leukemia is not controlled or eliminated, proliferated blasts are immunophenotyped (specifically looking for loss of CD19 antigen expression, vida infra for further study). Persistence of CAR-ECs is also monitored (although the latter is not expected to differ substantially from RS4; 11-based xenografts). Evaluation of a Switchable CAR-T Platform in a Syngeneic Model Although the xenograft models in immunodeficient mice allow measurement of the efficacy of the switchable platform, this model is not optimal to assess a method for alleviating the long-term lymphopenia associated with CAR-T-19 therapy. Switchable CAR-ECs are tested for the ability to reverse B cell aplasia in an immunocompetent B cell lymphoma mouse model. To create a murine surrogate CAR-T, the engineered peptide-based chimeric receptor is cloned to a Moloney murine leukemia-based retroviral vector for transduction into murine splenocytes. The murine-derived signaling domains CD28 and CD3z are used. The anti-human CD19 antibody does not cross-react with mouse CD19; therefore, the rat anti-mouse CD19 hybridoma 1D3 is obtained (from ATCC) and variable regions sequenced. This sequence is cloned into an expression vector for peptide fusion to create the switch and is cloned into a chimeric antigen receptor to create a CAR-T-19 mouse surrogate. After optimization of transduction and assessment of efficacy in vitro, the Myc5-CD19 cell line is used to establish B cell lymphoma in wild type C57BL/6 mice. CAR-ECs and switches are administered with dosing schedules based on xenograft studies and in vitro assays with surrogate system. Of particular interest in this model is to compare Fab, and IgG based switches on the rate of Myc5-CD19 disappearance and B cell ablation. As with xenografts studies, CAR-T proliferation is monitored and immunophenotypic characterization is carried out ex vivo. After eradication of lymphoma cells, switch administration is halted and the reproliferation of B cells in peripheral blood is monitored. Both the surrogate CAR-T-19 and the surrogate switchable CAR-T are expected to enable long-term remission, but only the switchable platform enables repopulation of B cells. CAR-T infiltration to major organs is monitored via histology on predefined cohorts and cellular analysis is carried out post-therapy. Long-term persistence of CAR-ECs in the absence of stimulation is followed. Evaluation of a Switchable CAR-T Platform in a Heterogeneous Cancer Model A first switch containing an anti-CD19 targeting antibody and a second switch containing the anti-CD20 targeting antibody rituximab are used sequentially or simultaneously to target different antigens in the same patient using a single adoptively transferred CAR-T in an effort to combat ALL relapse attributed to a CD19 escape variant during CAR-T-19 therapy. An anti-CD20 switch is created in analogous fashion to the anti-CD19 switch using the optimal characteristics determined in Example 3. A CAR-T-20 based on rituximab is constructed for comparison. Efficacy is tested in vitro against CD20-positive IM-9 and Daudi cells lines. To create a heterogeneous B-cell lymphoblast, the chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived K562 cell line (which is negative for CD20 and CD19) is stably transduced with the CD19 antigen using a lentiviral vector. Single cell clones are obtained via flow-sorting to obtain a population with homogenous CD19 expression. This cell line is then be transduced with CD20 and sorted by high (CD20hi) or low (CD20low) level of antigen expression. The activation and cytotoxicity of the switchable CAR-T on mixtures of CD19+CD20− and CD19+CD20hi or CD19+CD20low are assessed in vitro using the CD19 and CD20 switches (simultaneous or sequential administration). The method provides an opportunity to study the lowest percentage of CD20hi or CD20low cells in a population that are necessary to stimulate the CAR-T with the rituximab switch. This may be more physiologically relevant than a homogeneous population. This system is then tested in a xenograft mouse model. A mixture of CD19+CD20− and CD19+CD20+ are used to establish the xenograft. Alternatively, primary patient derived ALL samples are used for this experiment if found to be heterogeneous for CD19 or CD20 expression in our initial xenograft study. Switchable CAR-ECs with the anti-CD20 switch are administered to eliminate the CD19+CD20+ population and allow outgrowth of CD19+CD20− cells. To demonstrate the feasibility of retargeting the same CAR-T, the anti-CD19 switch is subsequently dosed and growth of remaining xenograft monitored. Tumors are evaluated for antigen expression in cohorts of sacrificed mice or in primary blasts. Simultaneous targeting is also assessed. Treatment is compared with CAR-T-19, CAR-T-20, or both simultaneously.

Example 10 Cytotoxicity of Anti-CD19 Fab-GCN4CL1, Anti-CD19 IgGFcNull-GCN4 and Anti-CD19 Fab-GCN4C-term CAR-EC Switches Peptide CAR-EC switches were created by fusing 14 amino acids of the GCN4 yeast transcription factor peptide sequence 7P14P (defined in Zahnd et al. (2004) Directed in vitro evolution and crystallographic analysis of a peptide-binding single chain antibody fragment (scFv) with low picomolar affinity, The Journal of Biological Chemistry 279, 18870-18877). The 14 amino acids were chosen based on those defined in crystal structure 1P4B of GCN4 peptide 7P14P with scFv c11L32Ser. The switches were constructed by either fusing the GCN4 peptide sequence to the C-terminus of the heavy chain of the Fab antibody or by fusing the GCN4 peptide sequence in the CL loop of the light chain of the Fab or IgG antibody. All expressions were carried out in CHO or HEK cells. To create a grafted GCN4 peptide based anti-CD19 CAR-T switch (SEQ ID NO: 30), the peptide NYHLENEVARLKKL (SEQ ID NO: 3), suggested to be the minimal binding epitope according to the crystal structure (PDB: 1P4B) (see FIG. 2) from the yeast transcription factor GCN4 peptide (7P14P) RMKQLEPKVEELLPKNYHLENEVARLKKLVGER (SEQ ID NO: 2), was grafted to the mouse anti-human CD19 Fab clone FMC63. The graft was carried out by replacing K63 (as counted from the N terminus of the constant region, which would be K169 when counting from the N terminus of the mature protein) of the light chain with the sequence GGGGSNYHLENEVARLKKLGGGGS (SEQ ID NO. 4)—the GCN4 epitope flanked by GGGGS linkers (SEQ ID NO: 48). The mass spec of anti-CD19 FabCL1-GCN4 is provided below (FIG. 3). Alternatively, the peptide is grafted to the heavy chain (SEQ ID NO: 29). The cytotoxic activity of the anti-CD19 FabCL1-GCN4 switch was assessed with the human PBMCs transduced with LV-EF1a-GCN4 (52SR4) to create CAR-T-GCN4 at E:T ratios of 10:1 and 24 hour incubation. Activity was assessed against NALM-6 (CD19+), RS4; 11 (CD19+), or RPMI-8226 (CD19−) (Table 1). The activity of the IgG (FcNull) switch was assessed against RS4; 11 (CD19+), or K562 (CD19−) (Table 2). The activity of the C-terminal switch was assessed against RS4; 11 (CD19+), or K562 (CD19−) (Table 3).

Switches tested were anti-CD19 FabCL1-GCN4 (“CL1 Fab), anti-CD19-GCN4 FabC-term (“C-term Fab), anti-CD19 IgGHC1-GCN4 (“HC1 IgG”), anti-CD19 IgGCL1-GCN4 (“CL1 IgG”), anti-CD19 IgGHinge-GCN4 (“Hinge IgG”), anti-CD19 IgGWT-GCN4 (“Wt IgG”), anti-CD19 FabHC1-GCN4 (“HC1 Fab”), and anti-CD19 FabN-term LC1-GCN4 (“N-term LC1 Fab”). Activities were assessed against RS4; 11 (CD19+) (FIG. 4, Table 4). FIG. 6 depicts the grafting positions of switches described in this example. The CL1 and HC1 grafting positions were applied to both Fab and IgG formats. The N-terminus grafting is shown as grafted to the light chain, however N-terminal grafting is not restricted to the light chain or Fab and may also be grafted to the heavy chain as well as the IgG format. The C-term position on the Fab is isosteric with the hinge IgG. In this context all Fab constructs are monovalent and all IgG constructs are bivalent, but these are not a necessary requirements for CAR-EC switches in general.

In this model swiCAR T-cells demonstrated regression after just 5 days of daily treatment with 0.5 mg/kg of anti-CD19 (GCN4) CL1 Fab. Treatment with the wild type anti-CD19 Fab with swiCAR T-cells were not capable of mediating tumor regression (not significant by one-way ANOVA). These results demonstrate the ability to redirect swiCAR T-cells in vivo. Experiment details: 106 luciferized NALM-6 cells were injected I.V. into nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID-γ−/−, NSG) mice. Six days later, 30×106 swiCAR T-cells or CART-19 cells (50% transduced) were infused I.V. Dosing of αCD19-Fab-GCN4-CL1 (I.V.) began on the same day, q.d. 0.5 mg/kg. After 5 days of dosing (day 11) mice were injected with luciferin and imaged on an in vivo imaging system (IVIS), n=3 or 4, average radiance (p/s/cm2/sr) plotted measured per mouse, and plotted mean±SEM, **p≦0.05, one-way ANOVA. The difference between no treatment and swiCAR-T+WT Fab is not statistically significant. Results are shown in FIG. 7A. Example 13 Cloning, Expression and Purification of Anti-BCMA-IgG-GCN4CL1 Cloning: Mammalian expression vector of CD19 IgG heavy chain was generated by in-frame ligation of amplified anti-BCMA IgG heavy chain (VH and CH1) to pFuse-hIgG1-Fc backbone vector (InvivoGen, CA). A gene encoding antibody BCMA light chain was amplified and cloned into the pFuse vector without hIgG1 Fc fragment. A gene encoding GCN4 (NYHLENEVARLKKL=SEQ ID NO: 3) with GGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 48) linker at both ends was synthesized as oligonucleotides. Subsequently, anti-BCMA-IgG-GCN4CL1 fusion proteins were created by grafting GCN4 with linker sequences at both ends into the CL region of the anti-BCMA light chain. The resulting mammalian expression vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification: anti-BCMA-IgG-GCN4CL1 was expressed through transient transfection of FreeStyle HEK 293 cells with expression vectors of BCMA-IgG heavy chain and GCN4-BCMA-CL1 light chain, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 28 mL FreeStyle HEK 293 cells containing 3×107 cells were seeded in a 125 mL shaking flask. 15 μg light chain plasmid and 15 μg heavy chain plasmid diluted in 1 mL Opti-MEM medium were added in 1 mL Opti-MEM containing 60 μL 293fectin (Invitrogen, Inc). After the plasmids were incubated with 293fectin for 30 min, the lipoplex mixture was added to the cell suspension. Cells were then shaken at 125 rpm in a 5% CO2 environment at 37° C. Culture medium containing secreted proteins was harvested at 48 and 96 hours after transfection. anti-BCMA-IgG-GCN4CL1 was purified by Protein G chromatography (Thermo Fisher Scientific, IL).

Transduction efficiency of PBMCs was approximately 50%. Activities were assessed against OPM2 (BCMA+), by quantifying lactate dehydrogenase due to cytolysis of target cells (FIG. 8, Table 5).
