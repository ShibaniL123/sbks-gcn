No. A30-178: N-[1-(Bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl]-1-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methanesulfonamide
Ethyl (2E)-3-(2-fluoro-5-nitrophenyl)acrylate (4000 mg, 16.7 mmol) and bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-ylamine (1810 mg, 15.2 mmol) were dissolved under argon in abs. N,N-dimethylformamide (30 mL), and then N,N-diisopropylethylamine (5.0 mL, 30.4 mmol) was added. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at a temperature of 50째 C. for 10 h and, after cooling to room temperature, water and ethyl acetate were added. The aqueous phase was then extracted repeatedly with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), ethyl (2E)-3-[5-nitro-2-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-ylamino)phenyl]acrylate (3120 mg, 68% of theory) was isolated as a colorless solid. Ethyl (2E)-3-[5-nitro-2-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-ylamino)phenyl]acrylate (3120 mg, 10.3 mmol) was then dissolved in abs. ethanol (200 mL), and (Ph3P)3RhCl (477 mg, 0.52 mmol) was added. After stirring at room temperature for 5 min, hydrogen was introduced into the reaction solution with a constant gas flow via a gas introduction apparatus for 10 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by LCMS. On completion of conversion, the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), it was possible to isolate ethyl 3-[5-nitro-2-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-ylamino)phenyl]propanoate (2740 mg, 88% of theory) as a colorless solid. Ethyl 3-[5-nitro-2-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-ylamino)phenyl]propanoate (2740 mg, 9.0 mmol) was dissolved in abs. tetrahydrofuran (100 mL) and added dropwise over a period of 30 minutes to a suspension, cooled down to 0째 C., of sodium hydride (540 mg, 13.5 mmol, 60% suspension in oil) in abs. tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) under argon. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 0째 C. for 1 h, and then water was added cautiously, followed by ethyl acetate after stirring for 5 min. The aqueous phase was then extracted repeatedly with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 6-nitro-1-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (1520 mg, 65%) was isolated as a colorless solid. In the next step, 6-nitro-1-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (2130 mg, 8.25 mmol) was added together with ammonium chloride (4410 mg, 82.5 mmol) and iron powder (1380 mg, 24.7 mmol) to abs. ethanol (150 mL) and water (75 mL), and the mixture was stirred under argon at a temperature of 80째 C. for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered through Celite and washed through thoroughly with methanol and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was taken up with dichloromethane and water and extracted thoroughly. The aqueous phase was re-extracted repeatedly with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 6-amino-1-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (1210 mg, 64% of theory) was isolated as a highly viscous foam. 6-Amino-1-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (60 mg, 0.26 mmol) was dissolved together with (4-trifluoromethylphenyl)methanesulfonyl chloride (65 mg, 0.29 mmol) in abs. acetonitrile (5 mL) in a baked-out round-bottom flask under argon, then pyridine (0.04 mL, 0.47 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure, the remaining residue was admixed with dil. HCl and dichloromethane, and the aqueous phase was extracted repeatedly with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), N-[1-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl]-1-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methanesulfonamide (56 mg, 47% of theory) was isolated as a colorless solid.
