BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an endoscope in which an insertion unit rotates in relation to an operation unit. 2. Description of the Related Art An endoscope comprises an elongated insertion unit which is inserted into a body cavity of a patient, and an operation unit connected to a proximal end part of the insertion unit by which the endoscope including the insertion unit is operated. A different type of endoscope from that described above comprises an elongated insertion unit inserted into a body cavity of a patient, and an operation unit by which the endoscope including the insertion unit is operated, wherein the operation unit is connected to a proximal end part of the insertion unit with the insertion unit maintained rotatable axially about a lengthwise direction of the insertion unit. For example, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2004-305413 discloses an endoscope as described above. In the Publication No. 2004-305413, a mouthpiece of an insertion unit is provided at a proximal end part of the insertion unit, and a mouthpiece of an operation unit provided at a distal end part of the operation unit. In order to connect the insertion unit and the operation unit to each other, the mouthpiece of the insertion unit is engaged in the mouthpiece of the operation unit. Therefore, the mouthpiece of the insertion unit and the mouthpiece of the operation unit function as a connection unit which connects the insertion unit and the operation unit together. This endoscope comprises a first O-ring that ensures water-tightness of the operation unit, and a second O-ring which seals the insertion unit and the operation unit to be water-tight with respect to each other. The first O-ring is provided between the distal end part of the operation unit and the mouthpiece of the operation unit. The second O-ring is provided at a connection unit, more specifically between the mouthpiece of the insertion unit and the mouthpiece of the operation unit. When the insertion unit rotates in relation to the operation unit, the second O-ring applies frictional resistance to the insertion unit and thereby controls resistive torque during the rotation. Thus, the second O-ring serves as a sealing member by which the insertion unit and operation unit are sealed water-tight, and also as a frictional resistance member which applies frictional resistance.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Hereinafter, an embodiment of the invention will be described in details with reference to the drawings. First Embodiment Configuration The first embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2. Endoscope 1 As shown in FIG. 1, the endoscope 1 is substantially configured by: an elongate insertion unit 2 which is inserted into a body cavity; an operation unit 3 which has a distal end part connected to a proximal end part of the insertion unit 2 so as to allow the insertion unit 2 to rotate axially about a lengthwise direction of the insertion unit 2 as an axis, and which is gripped by an operator to perform various operations on the endoscope 1 including the insertion unit 2; a universal cord 4 extended from the operation unit 3; and a connector unit 5 connected to an end part of the universal cord 4. The insertion unit 2 can be rotated axially about the lengthwise direction of the insertion unit 2 in relation to the operation unit 3 as the axis. The operation unit 3 performs an operation of changing a direction of a bendable part 7 of the insertion unit 2 described later. The connector unit 5 is connected to a light source device and a camera control unit both of which are unillustrated. Insertion Unit 2 The insertion unit 2 comprises: a long flexible tube part 6 which has a distal end part and a proximal end part 6a, and the proximal end part 6a is connected to the operation unit 3 side; the bendable part 7 which is connected to a distal end part of the flexible tube part 6 and can be bent in, for example, two directions; and a rigid tip unit 8 connected to a distal end part of the bendable part 7. The two directions are, for example, up and down directions. The rigid tip 8 comprises a non-illustrated observation optical system, a non-illustrated illumination optical system, a distal end opening part of a non-illustrated surgical instrument insertion channel, and a non-illustrated gas/water feed nozzle. The proximal end part 6a of the flexible tube part 6 comprises a bend stopper 20 which protects, from buckling, the connection structure between the flexible tube part 6 and the operation unit 3. Therefore, the bend stopper 20 has elasticity and is made of, for example, rubber. Operation Unit 3 The operation unit 3 comprises a bend control lever 9 to operate the bendable part 7. Further, the operation unit 3 comprises a bend operation mechanism which is provided inside the operation unit 3 and pulls a non-illustrated bend operation wire, interlocked with operation of the bend control lever 9. A proximal end part of the bend operation wire was connected to the bend operation mechanism, and a distal end part of the bend operation wire is inserted through the insertion unit 2 and connected to the rigid tip 8. The bend operation mechanism is driven, interlocked with the operation of the bend control lever 9. In this manner, the unillustrated bend operation wire is pulled and bends the bendable part 7 in two directions. Further, the insertion unit 2 bends toward a target portion. The operation unit 3 comprises the surgical instrument insertion part 10 connected to a non-illustrated surgical instrument insertion channel, and various operation switches 11. In addition, the operation unit 3 has a mark 13 which serves as an index when the insertion unit 2 rotates in relation to the operation unit 3. Linked Rotation Structure of Insertion Unit 2 and the Operation Unit 3 As shown in FIG. 2, the proximal end part 6a is provided with a flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 made of, for example, metal, and which is hard material. The flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 has, for example, a cylindrical shape. The flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 is integrally engaged in the proximal end part 6a. The outer circumferential surface of the proximal end part 6a and the inner circumferential surface of the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 are in tight contact with each other. As shown also in FIG. 2, the distal end part of the operation unit 3 is provided with an operation unit mouthpiece 41 made of, for example, metal, and which is hard material. The operation unit mouthpiece 41 has, for example, a cylindrical shape. The operation unit mouthpiece 41 is integrally engaged in the distal end part of the operation unit 3. The outer circumferential surface of the operation unit 3 and the inner circumferential surface of the operation unit mouthpiece 41 are in tight contact with each other. The operation unit mouthpiece 41 is inserted in a fixing member 17b having, for example, a cylindrical shape and is fixed to the fixing member 17b. The fixing member 17b has the mark 13. The flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 is inserted into the operation unit mouthpiece 41 so as to be axially rotatable about the lengthwise direction of the insertion unit 2 in relation to the operation unit mouthpiece 41 as the axis. In this manner, the insertion unit 2 (flexible tube part 6) is axially rotatably connected to the operation unit 3. As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the endoscope 1 further comprises a rotary dial 15, which is a rotary operation unit provided between the proximal end part of the bend stopper 20 and the distal end part (mark 13) of the operation unit 3 in the lengthwise direction of the insertion unit 2, and a support member 17a which supports the rotary dial 15. The rotary dial 15 is fixed to the outer circumferential surface of the support member 17a so as to cover the outer circumferential surface of the support member 17a having a ring-like shape. The support member 17a is fixed to the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 by a pin 19 in a manner that the inner circumferential surface of the support member 17a covers the outer circumferential surface of the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31. Therefore, the rotary dial 15 connects with the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 through the support member 17a and pin 19. The rotary dial 15 is operated to rotate the insertion unit 2 in a circumferential direction in relation to the operation unit 3 by the support member 17a, pin 19, and flexible tube part mouthpiece 31. At this time, the rotary dial 15 rotates together with the insertion unit 2, support member 17a, flexible tube part mouthpiece 31, and bend stopper 20. At this time, the mark 13 described above serves as an index for rotation of the rotary dial 15. The insertion unit 2, rotary dial 15, support member 17a, bend stopper 20, and flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 as described above are rotatable members, and the operation unit 3, mark 13, fixing member 17b, and operation unit mouthpiece 41 are fixed members. Water-tight Sealing Member 51/Torque Control Member 53 As shown in FIG. 2, the endoscope 1 comprises: a water-tight sealing member 51 which ensures water-tightness between the fixed members side and the rotatable members side, i.e., between the insertion unit 2 and the operation unit 3; and a torque control member 53 which applies frictional resistance to the insertion unit 2 during rotation of the insertion unit 2 in relation to the operation unit 3 and thereby controls resistive torque (hereinafter simply referred to as torque) of the insertion unit 2 when the insertion unit 2 rotates. The water-tight sealing member 51 and the torque control member 53 are provided between the fixed members side and the rotatable members side in radial directions of the insertion unit 2. In other words, the water-tight sealing member 51 and the torque control member 53 are sandwiched between the proximal end part side (flexible tube part mouthpiece 31) of the insertion unit 2 and the distal end part side (operation unit mouthpiece 41) of the operation unit 3. The water-tight sealing member 51 and the torque control member 53 are separate members. Specifically, the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 comprises a plurality of concave parts 33 recessed in the outer circumferential surface of the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31. In the concave parts 33, at least one concave part 33a faces the inner circumferential surface of the operation unit mouthpiece 41 as a fixed member, and at least one concave part 33c faces the inner circumferential surface of the support member 17a as a rotatable member. Concave part 33a may be provided in a plurality. Concave parts 33a and 33c each are formed in a ring-like shape along a circumferential direction of the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31. That is, concave parts 33a and 33c are provided throughout the whole outer circumferential surface of the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 along the circumferential direction of the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31. Concave parts 33a and 33c each have a regular tetragonal shape, for example. Concave parts 33a and 33c are provided, shifted from each other at a desired interval along the axial direction of the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31. Concave part 33a is provided closer to the operation unit 3 than concave part 33c. The torque control member 53 has the same shape as concave part 33a, and has a ring-like shape. The torque control member 53 has a regular tetragonal shape, for example. The torque control member 53 is embedded in concave part 33a. The torque control member 53 is in tight contact with the outer circumferential surface of the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31, i.e., the whole concave part 33a, and with the inner circumferential surface of the operation unit mouthpiece 41. Thus, the torque control member 53 is provided between the proximal end part side (flexible tube part mouthpiece 31) of the insertion unit 2 and the distal end part side (operation unit mouthpiece 41) of the operation unit 3 which are connected to each other in the radial directions of the insertion unit 2. The torque control member 53 is in tight contact with the proximal end part side (outer circumferential surface of the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31) of the insertion unit 2 and the distal end part side (outer circumferential surface of flexible tube part mouthpiece 31) of the operation unit 3 which are connected to each other. If a plurality of concave parts 33a are provided, a plurality of torque control members 53 are provided corresponding to concave part 33a. The water-tight sealing member 51 has the same shape as concave part 33c, and has a ring-like shape. The water-tight sealing member 51 has a regular tetragonal shape, for example. The water-tight sealing member 51 is embedded in concave part 33c. The water-tight sealing member 51 tightens the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 toward the inner circumferential surface of the support member 17a from the outer circumferential surface of the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31. In this case, the water-tight sealing member 51 is provided between the proximal end part side (flexible tube part mouthpiece 31) of the insertion unit 2 and the support member 17a which are connected to each other in the radial directions of the insertion unit 2. The water-tight sealing member 51 is in tight contact with the proximal end part (outer circumferential surface of the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31) of the connected insertion unit 2 and the inner circumferential surface of the support member 17a. Further water-tight sealing members 51 are provided, for example, between the operation unit 3 and the operation unit mouthpiece 41 and between the fixing member 17b fixed to the operation unit 3 and the rotary dial 15, in the radial directions of the insertion unit 2. Also in this case, the water-tight sealing members 51 are also in tight contact with the operation unit 3 and the operation unit mouthpiece 41 and are in tight contact with the fixing member 17b fixed to the operation unit 3 and the rotary dial 15, as described above. The water-tight sealing members 51 is an O-ring or a rubber member, for example. The torque control member 53 is provided at a position different from positions of the water-tight sealing members 51. Specifically, the torque control member 53 is provided, shifted at a desired interval from the water-tight sealing member 51 along the axial direction. The torque control member 53 is provided at least for the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 and the operation unit mouthpiece 41 forming a connection unit. For example, the torque control member 53 controls the torque of the insertion unit 2 by a frictional force of the torque control member 53 when the insertion unit 2 rotates. The torque control member 53 controls the torque of the insertion unit 2 in a manner that the torque of the insertion unit 2 is not smaller than approximately 1 Ncm and is not greater than approximately 30 Ncm. The torque control member 53 is in tight contact with the outer circumferential surface of the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31, i.e., the whole concave part 33a, and with the inner circumferential surface of the operation unit mouthpiece 41. Thus, the torque control member 53 is provided between the proximal end part side (flexible tube part mouthpiece 31) of the insertion unit 2 and the distal end part side (operation unit mouthpiece 41) of the operation unit 3 which are connected to each other in the radial directions of the insertion unit 2. The torque control member 53 is in tight contact with the proximal end part side (the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31) of the connected insertion unit 2 and the distal end part side (operation unit 41) of the operation unit 3 which are connected to each other. The torque control member 53 tightens the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 from the outer circumferential surface. At this time, the surfaces of the torque control member 53 in tight contact with the whole concave part 33a and the inner circumferential surface of the operation unit mouthpiece 41 are planar, for example. The water-tight sealing members 51 as described above each is an O-ring or a rubber member, for example. The torque control member 53 is provided inside of an area where water-tightness is ensured by the water-tight sealing members 51. Concave parts 33a, the torque control member 53 provided in concave part 33a, and the water-tight sealing members 51 are provided at positions to which no external load such as stress is applied from outside, for example, in the side of an internal member represented by the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 or inside the endoscope 1. The torque control member 53 which tightens the proximal end part side (flexible tube part mouthpiece 31) of the insertion unit 2 generates greater frictional force than the water-tight sealing member 51. The frictional force of the torque control member 53 includes, for example, tightening force of tightening the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31, frictional force generated by tightening the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31, and frictional force which is generated as the torque control member 53 is crushed. The same description as described applies also to the frictional force of the water-tight sealing member 51. The torque control member 53 and the water-tight sealing member 51 are formed of resin or silicone, for example. Operation Method Next, an operation method of the present embodiment will be described. When the rotary dial 15 is gripped and rotated, the insertion unit 2 rotates axially about the axis of the insertion unit 2 in relation to the operation unit 3. At this time, the torque control member 53 applies frictional resistance to the insertion unit 2, and controls the torque of the insertion unit 2. The torque control member 53 is provided at a position different from the water-tight sealing members 51. Therefore, even if the torque control member 53 controls the torque of the insertion unit 2, the water-tight sealing members 51 ensure water-tightness without influencing the torque control member 53. That is, even if the torque control member 53 is abraded, water-tightness is ensured since the torque control member 53 is a separate member from and is provided at a different position from the water-tight sealing members 51. Thus, water-tightness is ensured and frictional resistance is applied (control of the amount of torque) at the same time. The torque control member 53 is provided between the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 and the operation unit mouthpiece 41 in the radial directions of the insertion unit 2, and is in tight contact with the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 and the operation unit mouthpiece 41. Therefore, the torque control member 53 transmits frictional force to the insertion unit 2 without loss and thereby controls the torque of the insertion unit 2. The torque control member 53 is provided at a part where water-tightness is ensured by the water-tight sealing members 51. The torque control member 53 therefore controls the torque of the insertion unit 2, with water-tightness ensured by the water-tight sealing members 51. The torque control member 53 is provided at a position free from external load such as stress from outside. The torque control member 53 therefore controls the torque of the insertion unit 2 without the influence of any load. Further, the surfaces of the torque control member 53 in tight contact with the whole concave part 33a and the inner circumferential surface of the operation unit mouthpiece 41 are planar, for example. Therefore, the torque control member 53 makes tight contact with the surfaces without slippage. The frictional force of the torque control member 53 is greater than the frictional forces of the water-tight sealing members 51. Accordingly, the water-tightness is ensured while the torque of the insertion unit 2 is controlled, i.e., while the insertion unit 2 rotates in relation to the operation unit 3. The water-tight sealing member 51 is provided between the fixing member 17b fixed to the operation unit 3 and the fixed dial 15 fixed to the insertion unit 2, and is in tight contact with the fixing member 17b fixed to the operation unit 3 and the fixed dial 15 fixed to the insertion unit 2. Therefore, the water-tight sealing member 51 ensures precise water-tightness between the insertion unit 2 and the operation unit 3. Effects Thus, the torque control member 53 is provided at a position different from the positions of the water-tight sealing members 51. Therefore, the water-tightness can be securely ensured by the water-tight sealing members 51 without being influenced by the torque control members 53, and at the same time, frictional resistance can be steadily applied (control of torque) by the torque control member 53. That is, in the present embodiment achieves, water-tightness is ensured and frictional resistance is applied (control of torque) simultaneously with ease. Also in the present embodiment, the torque control member 53 is provided between the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 and the operation unit mouthpiece 41 in the radial directions of the insertion unit 2, and is in tight contact with the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31 and the operation unit mouthpiece 41. Therefore in the present embodiment, the torque of the insertion unit 2 can be controlled by transmitting frictional force to the insertion unit 2 without loss. Still also in the present embodiment, the torque control member 53 is provided at a part where water-tightness is ensured by the water-tight sealing members 51. In the present embodiment, the torque control members 53 can therefore control the torque of the insertion unit 2, with water-tightness ensured by the water-tight sealing members 51. Still in the present embodiment, the torque control member 53 is provided at a position free from external load such as stress from outside. Accordingly in the present embodiment, the torque of the insertion unit 2 can be controlled without the influence of any load. Further in the present embodiment, the surfaces of the torque control member 53 in tight contact with the whole concave part 33a and the inner circumferential surface of the operation unit mouthpiece 41 are planar, for example. Therefore in the present embodiment, the torque control member 53 can make tight contact with the surfaces without slippage. Also in the present embodiment, the frictional force of the torque control member 53 is greater than the frictional forces of the water-tight sealing members 51. Accordingly in the present embodiment, the water-tightness can be ensured while the torque of the insertion unit 2 is controlled, i.e., while the insertion unit 2 rotates in relation to the operation unit 3. Further in the present embodiment, the water-tight sealing member 51 is provided between the fixing member 17b fixed to the operation unit 3 and the fixed dial 15 fixed to the insertion unit 2, and is in tight contact with the fixing member 17b fixed to the operation unit 3 and the fixed dial 15 fixed to the insertion unit 2. Therefore in the present invention, water-tightness can be securely ensured between the insertion unit 2 and the operation unit 3. Still further in the present embodiment, the torque control member 53 controls the torque of the insertion unit 2 in a manner that the torque of the insertion unit 2 is not smaller than approximately 1 Ncm and is not greater than 30 Ncm. In this manner, in the present embodiment, the insertion unit 2 is prevented from freely rotating at timing which is not intended by a user during use of the insertion unit 2, and the torque can be set to a torque value which allows the user to easily rotate the insertion unit 2. Thus, the present embodiment can improve usability of the insertion unit 2. In addition, the torque control member 53 needs only to be capable of controlling the torque of the insertion unit 2. Therefore, torque control members 53 may be provided, for example, between the mark 13 and the rotary dial 15, between the operation unit mouthpiece 41 and the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31, between the support member 17a and the fixed member 17b, and/or between the operation unit mouthpiece 41 and the support member 17a, as shown in FIG. 3. The shapes of the cross-sections of the torque control members 53 are not particularly limited. The cross-sections of the torque control members 53 may have at least one of a rhombic shape as shown in FIG. 4A, a circular shape indicated as shown in FIG. 4B, a rounded rectangular shape with four arcuate corners as shown in FIG. 4C, and a rectangular shape as shown in FIG. 4D. The surfaces 53a of the torque control members 53 need not be limited to planar surfaces. The surfaces 53a may have at least one of a shape having a saw-wave-like profile as shown in FIG. 5A, a shape having a polygonal profile with arcuate edges as shown in FIG. 5B, and a shape having a rectangular-wave-like profile as shown in FIG. 5C. In the torque control member 53 shown in FIG. 5C, the sizes of convex and concave parts may decrease along the axial direction of the torque control member 53 from the proximal end part side to the distal end part side of the torque control member 53. Further, the whole concave part 33a and the inner circumferential surface of the operation unit mouthpiece 41, which are in tight contact with the surface of a torque control member 53, may be uneven. In this manner, the torque of the insertion unit 2 can be controlled in the present embodiment. The surface 53a of the torque control member 53 may be coated with, for example, a fluoride coat or a DLC coat. Further, the concave parts 33 may be formed in the inner circumferential surface of the operation unit mouthpiece 41, so as to face the outer circumferential surface of the flexible tube part mouthpiece 31. The torque control members 53 may be, for example, conductive in order to stabilize conduction between the insertion unit 2 and the operation unit 3. The present invention is not limited exactly to the foregoing embodiment but can be practiced without deviating from the subject matters of the invention in practical phases. Various inventions can be derived from appropriate combination of a plurality of components disclosed in the foregoing embodiment. Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art.
