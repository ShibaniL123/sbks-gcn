Ethylene glycol (CAS#107-21-1, 0.51 mL, 9.2 mmol, 2.0 eq) and a spatula of p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA, CAS#104-15-4) were added to a solution of 5-bromo-2-methoxynicotinaldehyde (CAS#25016-01-7, 1.0 g, 4.6 mmol, 1.0 eq) in toluene (20 mL). The reaction mixture was heated to reflux overnight. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and diluted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with a saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution, dried on Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (heptane/dichloromethane 90/10 to 20/80) to give the title compound (795 mg, 83%). LC/MS (ESI+) m/z 260.2 (M+H)+.
