FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to protein scaffolds that specifically bind a target and methods of making, screening and using such scaffolds. 4. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to protein scaffolds useful, for example, for the generation of products having novel binding characteristics. Proteins having relatively defined three-dimensional structures, commonly referred to as protein scaffolds, may be used as reagents for the design of engineered products. These scaffolds typically contain one or more regions which are amenable to specific or random sequence variation, and such sequence randomization is often carried out to produce libraries of proteins from which desired products may be selected. One particular area in which such scaffolds are useful is the field of antibody mimetic design. While therapeutic antibodies are known with some successful examples on the market (HERCEPTIN®, AVASTIN®, SYNAGIS®), there is a growing interest in generating antibody fragments as therapeutic proteins. The advantages are the ease of manipulation by molecular biology techniques in order to obtain desired binding characteristics, the ability to express such fragments in microbial systems, and the expectation that antibody fragments will have better tissue penetration than full-length antibodies. One example is REOPRO®. In addition, there have been efforts to develop small, non-antibody therapeutics, i.e., antibody mimetics, in order to capitalize on the advantages of antibodies and antibody fragments, such as high affinity binding of targets and low immunogenicity and toxicity, while avoiding some of the shortfalls, such as the requirement for intradomain disulfide bonds which require proper refolding, and the tendency for antibody fragments to aggregate and be less stable than full-length IgGs. One example is a “minibody” scaffold, which is related to the immunoglobulin fold, which is designed by deleting three beta strands from a heavy chain variable domain of a monoclonal antibody (Tramontano et al., J. Mol. Recognit. 7:9, 1994). This protein includes 61 residues and can be used to present two hypervariable loops, much like complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in antibodies. These two loops have been randomized and products selected for antigen binding, but thus far the framework appears to have somewhat limited utility due to solubility problems. Another framework used to display loops has been tendamistat, a small protein inhibitor of α-amylase, which contains a 74 residue, six-strand beta sheet sandwich held together by two disulfide bonds and forms 3 CDR-like loops (McConnell and Hoess, J. Mol. Biol. 250:460, 1995). Other proteins have been tested as frameworks and have been used to display randomized residues on alpha helical surfaces (Nord et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 15:772, 1997; Nord et al., Protein Eng. 8:601, 1995), loops between alpha helices in alpha helix bundles (Ku and Schultz, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:6552, 1995), and loops constrained by disulfide bridges, such as those of the small protease inhibitors (Markland et al., Biochemistry 35:8045, 1996; Markland et al., Biochemistry 35:8058, 1996; Rottgen and Collins, Gene 164:243, 1995; Wang et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:12250, 1995). Thus, there is a need to develop small, stable, artificial antibody-like molecules for a variety of therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Citation or discussion of a reference herein shall not be construed as an admission that such is prior art to the present invention. 5. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a family of recombinant, non-naturally occurring protein scaffolds capable of binding any compound of interest. In particular, the proteins described herein may be used to display defined loops which are analogous to the complementarity-determining regions (“CDRs”) of an antibody variable region. These loops may be subjected to randomization or restricted evolution to generate diversity required to bind a multitude of target compounds. The proteins may be assembled into multispecific scaffolds capable of binding different targets. The invention provides recombinant, non-naturally occurring polypeptide scaffolds (herein after known as “scaffolds of the invention”) comprising, a plurality of beta strand domains linked to a plurality of loop region sequences derived from a naturally occurring protein sequence, wherein one or more of said loop region sequences vary by deletion, substitution or addition by at least one amino acid from the corresponding loop sequences in the naturally occurring protein sequence, and wherein the beta strand domains of the polypeptide scaffold have at least 50% homology to the corresponding domain sequences of a naturally occurring protein sequence. In some embodiments, the naturally occurring sequence is the protein sequence corresponding to human tenascin C. In particular, these scaffolds include, the third FnIII domain of tenascin C (also known as the “Tn3” domain). In specific embodiments, scaffolds of the invention comprise an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 5-32, 64-67, and 210. In other specific embodiments, scaffolds of the invention may be encoded by a nucleic acid comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:33-59. In other embodiments, the naturally occurring sequence corresponds to a predicted Tn3 structural motif, such as those derived from a thermophilic organism, for example but not limited to, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Staphylothermus marinus, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, Sulfolobus solfataricus, and Sulfolobus tokodaii. In specific embodiments, scaffolds of the invention comprise an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 2-4, 68-88, and 210. In other specific embodiments, scaffolds of the invention may be encoded by a nucleic acid comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:89-98. In another aspect of the invention, the scaffolds of the invention also include disulfide-stabilized scaffolds. The disulfide-stabilized scaffolds exhibit enhanced stability as measured by thermal tolerance, resistance to chaotropic denaturation and protease treatment. The scaffolds of the invention are engineered to bind targets of interest, as described herein. Such binding may, for example, exhibit an affinity of at least 100 μM. The invention also provides multimeric scaffolds comprising at least two scaffolds of the invention (hereinafter known as “multimeric scaffolds of the invention”). In some embodiments, the multimeric scaffolds of the invention comprise at least two scaffolds linked, for example, but not limited to, a dimerization domain, an amino acid linker, a disulfide bond, a chemical crosslink, and IgG molecule or fragment thereof, or an Fc region. The invention also provides polypeptide display libraries (hereinafter referred to as “libraries of the invention”) comprising a plurality of scaffolds of the invention. The libraries of the invention are useful for capturing and identifying target binding scaffolds to build multimeric scaffolds. In another aspect the invention also provides isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding the scaffolds and libraries of the invention. The invention also provides methods of making, using, screening, optimizing, and engineering the scaffolds and libraries of the invention. In yet another aspect, the invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the scaffolds of the invention. The invention also provides methods of treating, preventing, ameliorating, detecting, diagnosing, or monitoring a disease or symptoms thereof, as described herein, in a patient by administering therapeutically effective amounts of the scaffolds of the invention and/or pharmaceutical compositions comprising the scaffolds of the invention.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES For the purpose of illustrating the invention, there are depicted in the drawings certain embodiments on the invention. However, the invention is not limited to the precise arrangements and instrumentalities of the embodiments depicted in the drawings. FIG. 1. Recombinant total cell expression of scaffolds. Presented here is a Coomassie stained PAGE gel of various recombinant lysates from E. coli cultures expressing protein scaffolds. Highly expressed scaffolds are indicated with an asterisk (*). FIG. 2. Expression and purification of a Tn3 based scaffold. Presented here is a Coomassie stained PAGE gel documenting the Tn3 based scaffold after recombinant expression and purification. The Tn3 scaffold was readily purified to homogeneity. FIG. 3A. Melting temperature determination for a Tn3 based scaffold. The graph illustrates the thermal melting curve determination of the Tn3 based scaffold as measured by differential scanning calorimetry. The Tm was determined to be about 45° C. at pH 7.0. FIG. 3B. Urea denaturation profile of a Tn3 based scaffold. The graph represents the denaturation profile of a Tn3 based scaffold in various concentrations of urea at pH 7.5. The change in intrinsic fluorescence of the molecules was used as a measure of unfolding of the molecule. For the Tn3 scaffold, unfolding results in an increase in fluorescence intensity and shift to a higher wavelength. As demonstrated in the figure, the molecule is folded at low concentrations of urea (less than or equal to 1M) and became denatured at higher concentrations of urea. The molarity at which 50% of the molecules are unfolded was calculated to be about 2M. FIG. 3C. A Tn3 scaffold exists in a monomeric state. The graph represents the results of a size exclusion chromatography analysis of a purified Tn3 scaffold to determine the relative proportions of contaminating fragments and/or higher order structures. As represented by the percentages on the graph, over 97% of the scaffold eluted in monomeric form (determined to be around 11 kDa by an online light scattering detector) while only a small fraction (around 3%) eluted at a peak of about 21 kDa, possibly as a dimer. FIG. 4. The BC loops of scaffolds demonstrate loop length diversity. The graph represents the length diversity of the BC loop of various Tn3 related protein scaffolds. (A) represents the loop length diversity exhibited by sequences derived from a subset of Tn3 related scaffolds from the PDB database (51 sequences). (B) represents the loop length diversity exhibited by sequences derived from the Swiss-prot database (397 sequences). As presented, the BC loop of various Tn3 related scaffolds exhibit lengths from 7-26 amino acid residues. According to the scheme used herein, the length of the BC loops in Tn3 is 9 residues. FIG. 5. The FG loops of scaffolds demonstrate loop length diversity. The graph represents the length diversity of the FG loops of various Tn3 related protein scaffolds. The figure depicts the FG loop length diversity exhibited by sequences derived from a subset of Tn3 related scaffolds from the PDB database.

As presented, the DE loop of Tn3 related scaffolds exhibit lengths from about 4 to about 17 amino acid residues. According to the scheme used herein, the length of the DE loop in Tn3 is 6 residues. FIG. 7A. The 9 amino acid residue BC loops of scaffolds demonstrate sequence diversity. The graph represents the sequence diversity exhibited by 9 amino acid residue BC loops from the Swiss-Prot database (73 sequences). Using the alignment tool, Weblogo, the relative incidence of an amino acid occurring at a particular position in a 9 amino acid long BC loop is represented by the size of the single letter code above the particular position. For example, at position 3 of the analyzed BC loops of 9 amino acid residues, the most prevalent amino acid is Proline (P), followed by Alanine (A), followed by Valine (V). FIG. 7B. The 12 amino acid residue BC loops of scaffolds demonstrate sequence diversity. The graph represents the sequence diversity exhibited by 12 amino acid residue BC loops from the Swiss-Prot data set (99 sequences). Using the alignment tool, Weblogo, the relative incidence of an amino acid occurring at a particular position in a 12 amino acid long BC loop is represented by the size of the single letter code above the particular position. For example, at position 3 of the analyzed BC loops of 12 amino acid residues, the most prevalent amino acid is Proline (P), followed by Glycine (G), followed by Glutamine (Q). FIG. 8. The FG loops of scaffolds demonstrate sequence diversity. The graph represents the sequence diversity exhibited by FG loops from all of the lengths from the Swiss-Prot data set (393 sequences). Using the alignment tool, Weblogo, the relative incidence of an amino acid occurring at a particular position in the FG loop is represented by the size of the single letter code above the particular position. For example, at position 2 of the analyzed FG loops, the most prevalent amino acid is Asparagine (N), followed by Threonine (T), followed by Lysine (K). FIG. 9A. Expression and purification of a SYNAGIS® specific Tn3 scaffold. Presented here is a Coomassie stained PAGE gel documenting the SYNAGIS® specific Tn3 scaffold (SynBP01) after recombinant expression and purification. The SynBP01 scaffold was readily purified to homogeneity. FIG. 9B. The KD determination of SYNAGIS® specific binding scaffold. The tracing represents an experiment characterizing the specific binding affinity for the SynBP01 scaffold for SYNAGIS® by a BIACORE® assay. Using immobilized SYNAGIS® and mobile phase SynBP01 at various concentrations it was determined that the binding affinity (KD) was about 16 μM. FIG. 9C. The SYNAGIS® specific binding scaffold exhibits a similar stability to the base scaffold. A SYNAGIS® specific binding scaffold was identified from a library of scaffolds as prepared in Example 3. Presented here are the results from a Urea denaturation experiment in which the intrinsic fluorescence measures the unfolding of the proteins. In this experiment, the Tn3 scaffold (WT) and SYNAGIS® specific binding scaffold SynBP01 (A1) exhibited very similar denaturation profiles with increasing Urea concentrations. FIG. 9D. Binding scaffolds engage the target antibody SYNAGIS®, bivalently. The tracing represents an experiment characterizing the engagement of two scaffolds on an immobilized molecule in a BIAcore assay format. In this experiment, immobilized SYNAGIS® is overlaid with a either a solution of 1 μM SYNAGIS® specific protein scaffold (blue tracing) or a solution of 1 μM SYNAGIS® specific protein scaffold+0.19 μM crosslinking mAb (red tracing). The graph depicts the differential binding characteristics exhibited by monomer scaffolds or crosslinked scaffolds. FIG. 10A-C. Sequence alignment of naturally occurring disulfide containing Tn3 structural motifs. The sequence alignment presented outlines the position of cysteine residues in 21 naturally occurring disulfide containing Tn3 related structural motifs in an effort to determine candidate positions for stability engineering. Like-colored Cys residues within individual Tn3 sequences are linked by a disulfide bond. The sequence of Tn3 (Iten.pro) is included in the alignment to facilitate the identification of residues and positions in Tn3 corresponding to cysteine residues in disulfide-containing scaffolds. FIG. 10D. Targeted disulfide engineering to increase scaffold stability. The graphic depicts the potential disulfide locations to be engineered into the scaffold sequence. In an effort to increase stability, the four depicted disulfide locations were individually engineered into the scaffold. The resultant recombinant scaffolds were termed Tn3SS1, Tn3SS2, Tn3SS3, and Tn3SS4 respectfully. FIG. 10E. RP-HPLC tracing of selected purified disulfide engineered scaffolds. Depicted in the graphic are the reverse-phase HPLC chromatograms of (i) Tn3SS3 and (ii) Tn3SS4 after purification, following reduction, and after refolding to form disulfide bonds. The chromatograms demonstrated that the cysteines contained within the scaffolds are only partially oxidized following protein purification (upper tracing) are completely reduced by treatment with DTT (middle tracing) and completely oxidized to disulfides after refolding (lower tracing). FIG. 10F. Expression and characterization of disulfide engineered scaffolds. The figure depicts the results of a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of 4 disulfide engineered scaffolds presented in FIG. 10B. Samples of purified and refolded constructs Tn3 (WT), Tn3SS1(1), Tn3SS2 (2), Tn3SS3 (3), Tn3SS4 (4) were analyzed under reducing and non-reducing conditions to evaluate the predicted formation of disulfide bonds. As depicted, the Tn3SS2 forms a disulfide linked dimer. The other constructs, (Tn3, Tn3SS1, Tn3SS3, and Tn3SS4) do not form dimers in response to the incorporated cysteine residues as the purified and refolded disulfide containing scaffolds migrate similarly under reducing and non-reducing conditions. FIG. 10G. Urea denaturation profile of the single disulfide engineered scaffolds. The graph depicts the results of a urea denaturation study of selected disulfide containing scaffolds outlined in panel A Tn3SS1(SS1), Tn3SS3(SS3), and Tn3SS4(SS4) as well as Tn3 (WT) scaffold. In this experiment the various purified and refolded scaffolds are exposed to increasing levels of urea. As a measure of unfolding, the relative fluorescence is monitored. As a protein unfolds or becomes less stable, the relative fluorescence increases. As presented in the panel, the Tn3SS1 containing scaffold exhibits a higher sensitivity to urea compared to the Tn3 scaffold and is therefore less stable. Also, scaffolds Tn3SS3 and Tn3SS4 exhibit greater resistance to urea mediated denaturation as compared to Tn3 and are therefore more stable. The scaffold Tn3SS4 exhibited the greatest resistance to urea mediated denaturation of the scaffolds tested in this experiment. FIG. 10H. The Tn3SS4 disulfide engineered scaffold exhibits increased stability as compared to the Tn3 scaffold. The graph depicts the results from a guanidine hydrochloride denaturation assay comparing the stability of the Tn3 scaffold (circles) to the disulfide containing scaffold, Tn3SS4 (squares). As presented in the graph, the Tn3SS4 scaffold exhibited a greater resistance to guanidine mediated denaturation, and therefore, was more stable, as compared to the Tn3 scaffold. FIG. 10I. The Tn3SS4 scaffold exhibits a high level of protease resistance compared to the Tn3 scaffold. The panel depicts the results from a protease sensitivity assay comparing the stability of the Tn3 scaffold to the Tn3SS4 containing scaffold. In this experiment, the relative protease resistance correlates with the protein stability. For the Tn3 scaffold, incubation for as little as ten minutes with thermolysin results in degradation. After one hour of incubation in thermolysin, the Tn3 scaffold is completely degraded. The Tn3SS4 containing scaffold exhibited thermolysin resistance over the entire 16 hour time course suggesting a greater stability than the Tn3 scaffold. FIG. 10J. The Tn3SS4 disulfide engineered scaffold exhibits a high melting temperature (Tm). The graph depicts the results from a thermal stability study comparing the Tn3 scaffold (dotted line) to the disulfide containing Tn3SS4 scaffold (solid line). As presented in the melt curve, the Tn3SS4 scaffold exhibited a higher melting temperature (about 71° C.) than the Tn3 scaffold (about 45° C., See also FIG. 3A). FIG. 10K. The Tn3SS4 disulfide engineered scaffold exists in a monomeric state. The figure depicts a tracing from a Size exclusion chromatography/multiple-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis of the Tn3SS4 scaffold. The data demonstrates that the purified Tn3SS4 scaffold existed in a monomeric state, determined to be about 11 kDa by an online light scattering detector. FIG. 10L. RP-HPLC chromatograms of the purified Tn3SS3+4 disulfide engineered scaffolds. Depicted in the graphic are the reverse-phase HPLC chromatograms of Tn3SS3+4 after purification, following reduction, and after refolding to form disulfide bonds. The tracings demonstrated that the cysteines contained within the scaffolds are only partially oxidized following protein purification (upper tracing) are completely reduced by treatment with DTT (middle tracing) and are completely oxidized to two disulfide bonds after refolding (lower tracing). FIG. 10M. The dual disulfide containing scaffold Tn3SS3+4 exhibits an elevated level of stability. The graph depicts the results from a guanidine hydrochloride denaturation assay comparing the stability of the Tn3 (WT) scaffold (circles) to the single disulfide containing scaffold, Tn3SS4 (squares) and to the double disulfide containing scaffold, Tn3SS3+4 (angles). As presented in the graph, the refolded double disulfide scaffold, Tn3SS3+4 exhibited a greater resistance to guanidine mediated denaturation, and therefore more stable, as compared to the single refolded disulfide containing scaffold, Tn3SS4 as well as the Tn3 scaffold. FIG. 11A. Expression and purification of scaffolds from hyperthermophilic organisms. Presented here are Coomassie-stained PAGE gels documenting the expression and purification of predicted scaffolds (Tn3 structural motifs) from various hyperthermophilic bacteria. All of the predicted scaffolds were expressed and purified to homogeneity. In the figure, T represents total cell lysate, S represents soluble lysate fraction and P represents purified protein. FIG. 11B. A scaffold from Staphylothermus marinus exhibits a high level of thermal stability. The graph depicts the thermal stability of a scaffold from Staphylothermus marinus. The putative scaffold was recombinantly expressed, purified, and subjected to the thermal stability test. As presented in the graph, the scaffold from Staphylothermus marinus exhibits a high melting temperature (around 83° C. at pH 7.0). FIG. 11C. A scaffold from Sulfolobus tokodaii exhibits a high level of stability. The panel depicts the thermal stability of a scaffold from Sulfolobus tokodaii. The putative scaffold was recombinantly expressed, purified, and subjected to the thermal stability test in a differential scanning calorimeter. As presented in the graph, the scaffold from Sulfolobus tokodaii exhibits a high melting temperature (around 98° C.) at pH 3.0. The scaffold also exhibits a high level of stability at pH 7.0, however, it aggregates and falls out of solution at temperatures greater than 75° C. FIG. 11D. A scaffold from Staphylothermus marinus exhibits a high level of stability. The graph depicts the results from a guanidine hydrochloride denaturation assay demonstrating the high protein stability of a scaffold from Staphylothermus marinus. As presented in the graph, a high concentration of guanidine hydrochloride are required to unfold the scaffold (50% of the molecules are unfolded at a guanidine concentration of 5.0 M), which exemplified high stability. FIG. 11E. A scaffold from Sulfolobus tokodaii exhibits a high level of stability. The panel depicts the results from a guanidine hydrochloride denaturation assay demonstrating the high protein stability of a scaffold from Sulfolobus tokodaii. Protein unfolding is correlated with an increase in relative fluorescence of the molecule. As presented in the graph, a high concentration of guanidine-HCl is required to unfold the scaffold at either pH 7.0 (circles) or at pH 3.0 (squares), which exemplified high stability. FIG. 11F. A scaffold from Staphylothermus marinus exhibits a high level of protease resistance. The graph depicts the results from a protease sensitivity assay measuring the stability of a scaffold from Staphylothermus marinus. In this experiment, the relative protease resistance correlates with the protein stability. For the scaffold, incubation for ten minutes with thermolysin results in a small level of degradation which remains stable over time. The Staphylothermus marinus scaffold exhibited thermolysin resistance over the entire 16 hour time course. FIG. 11G. A scaffold from Sulfolobus tokodaii exhibits a high level of protease resistance. The panel depicts the results from a protease sensitivity assay measuring the stability of a scaffold from Sulfolobus tokodaii. In this experiment, the relative protease resistance correlates with the protein stability. The Sulfolobus tokodaii scaffold exhibited thermolysin resistance over the entire 16 hour time course. FIG. 11H. A scaffold from Staphylothermus marinus is purified from a host cell. The panel depicts one step in the purification of the Staphylothermus marinus scaffold. Due to the high level of stability exhibited by this scaffold, it is possible to heat the crude E. coli lysate containing the recombinant scaffold to remove the bulk of the host cell proteins while retaining the scaffold. Lane 1 represents the crude lysate prior to heat treatment. Coomassie staining of a PAGE gel containing the crude lysate demonstrates that the candidate scaffold was present. Heat treatment of the crude lysate at 70° C. for 15 minutes resulted in a loss of much of the host cell proteins while the scaffold remains intact (Lane 2). FIG. 11I. A scaffold from Staphylothermus marinus is purified from a host cell. The panel depicts one step in the purification of the Staphylothermus marinus scaffold. Due to the high level of stability exhibited by this scaffold, it is possible to treat the crude E. coli lysate containing the recombinant scaffold with thermolysin to degrade the bulk of the host cell proteins while retaining the scaffold. Lane 1 represents the crude lysate prior to protease treatment. Coomassie staining of a PAGE gel containing the crude lysate demonstrates that the scaffold is present. Protease treatment of the crude lysate at 55° C. for 45 minutes resulted in a loss of much of the host cell proteins while the scaffold remains intact (Lane 2). FIG. 11J. A scaffold from Sulfolobus tokodaii is purified from a host cell. The panel depicts the purification of the Sulfolobus tokodaii scaffold. Due to the high level of stability exhibited by this scaffold, it is possible to incubate the crude lysate containing the recombinant scaffold at pH 3.0 and raise the temperature to 70° C. for 15 min to remove the majority of the host cell proteins while retaining the soluble scaffold. Lane 1 represents the crude E. coli lysate prior to acidification or heat treatment. Lane 2 represents the soluble protein remaining after lowering the pH of the crude lysate to 3.0. Lane 3 represents the soluble protein after lowering the pH to 3.0 and incubation at 70° C. for 15 min. The scaffold was resistant and remained in solution through these treatments. FIG. 12. Two loops are required for binding of SynBP01 to SYNAGIS®. This panel depicts the binding of SynBP01 and variants thereof to plate bound SYNAGIS®. In this experiment, the BC and FG loops of SynBP01 were transferred to a wild-type scaffold to create single loop variants of SynBP01. These variants (designated BC only and FG only) were subjected to an ELISA based binding assay in which they did not exhibit binding to the plate bound SYNAGIS®. As a control, SynBP01 binding in the ELISA assay format is presented. In addition, the SS4 disulfide mutation was overlaid on SynBP01. This variant, designated SynBP01 SS4 did not exhibit any binding to plate bound SYNAGIS® in the ELISA format. FIG. 13. Binding affinity determination of the TRAIL-R2 specific clone 5E5 as measured by BIAcore. This panel depicts an affinity determination of clone 5E5 for chip bound TRAIL-R2. The Kd was estimated to be approximately 700 nM. FIG. 14. Competitive binding exhibited by multiple TRAIL-R2 specific clones. Depicted in this panel are the results from a competitive binding experiment of various TRAIL-R2 specific scaffolds. Two TRAIL-R2 specific clones, 5E5 and 7G11 were tested for competitive binding against other TRAIL-R2 specific clones displayed on phage. 5E5 competes with itself and all other clones except 2H6 and 7G11. 7G11 only competes with itself and 2H6. This data indicates that there are two groups of clones recognizing two different epitopes on TRAIL-R2. FIG. 15. Competition of various TRAIL-R2 specific clones. Depicted in this panel are the results from a competitive binding experiment of various TRAIL-R2 specific scaffolds. Five TRAIL-R2 specific clones, 1E3, 1G11, 2B4, 1C12 and 2D3 were tested for competitive binding against other TRAIL-R2 specific clones displayed on phage. 1E3, 1C12 and 2D3 competed with most of the phage displayed clones except for 8B3 and 7G11. Soluble 1G11 did not compete with any of the phage displayed clones, and 2B4 showed little to moderate inhibition in most cases. This data suggests that 1E3, 1C12 and 2D3 recognize the same epitope on TRAIL-R2. FIG. 16. TRAIL-R2 binders inhibits cell viability. Depicted in panel is the sensitivity of the Colo-205 cell line to the treatment of 5E5, 7G11, 1C12, 2D3 and 1E3 when complexed with anti-HIS tag antibody and anti-mouse IgG in the molar ratio of 2:1:0.5. The percent viable cells was obtained by expressing the assay signal for treatment with TRAIL-R2 binding clones as a percentage of the signal obtained for cells treated with a control Tn3 which does not bind TRAIL-R2. FIG. 17A. Diagram representing examples of Multivalent Tn3-fusion proteins. The bivalent construct represents a Tn3 fused to an antibody Fc region whereas the tetravalent construct fuses the Tn3 to heavy chain constant regions and/or the light chain Ckappa region. FIG. 17B. Diagram showing linkage of protein modules in Multivalent Tn3-fusion proteins. i) In the Fc fusion construct, the N-terminal Tn3 module is linked to the Fc region of IgG1 via a peptide linker and hinge regions of IgG1. The linker sequence can vary in length and composition, but was a -GA- motif in Example 16. ii) In the Ckappa fusion construct, the N-terminal Tn3 module is linked to the constant region of an antibody kappa light chain via a peptide linker. The linker sequence can vary in length and composition, but was a -GGGTPT- motif in Example 16. iii) In the IGHG1 fusion construct, the N-terminal Tn3 module is linked to the constant region of an IgG1 heavy chain via a peptide linker. The linker sequence can vary in length and composition, but was a -GGGTPT- motif in Example 16. FIG. 18. Expression of multivalent Tn3 constructs. Represented in the figure is a reducing SDS-PAGE showing the relative sizes of bivalent Tn3 constructs (samples 1-3), and tetravalent Tn3 constructs (samples 4-7) after protein A purification. Sample numbers correspond to those shown in Table 10. All constructs expressed exhibit the predicted sizes by this analysis. FIG. 19. Binding affinity of Tn3 monomers and multimers. Depicted in this panel are sensorgrams from a Biosensor binding experiment using mono-, bi- and tetravalent 1C12 and D1 Tn3 constructs. TRAIL-R2-Fc fusion protein was immobilized on a sensor chip while sample proteins were injected over the chip. “tetra” refers to the tetravalent Cκ/IGHG1 fusion constructs. The 1C12 constructs show improved binding to TRAIL-R2 as a function of valency, while the control D1 constructs do no exhibit binding. FIG. 20. Effects of Bivalent Tn3 constructs targeting TRAIL-R2. Depicted in this panel are the growth inhibition curves of H2122 cells that were treated with (A) TRAIL-R2 specific Tn3 binder 1C12 in bivalent form or a (B) non-specific Tn3 binder in bivalent form with or without the addition of a crosslinking antibody (anti-human Fc). Relative to the control non-binder, the TRAIL-R2 specific binder exhibited mild activity in the assay, which decreased in the presence of the secondary antibody. FIG. 21. Effects of Tetravalent Tn3 constructs targeting TRAIL-R2. Depicted in this panel are the growth inhibition curves of H2122 cells that were treated with (A) TRAIL-R2 specific Tn3 binder 1C12 in monospecific tetravalent form or a (B) non-specific Tn3 binder in monospecific tetravalent form with or without the addition of a crosslinking antibody (anti-human Fc). Relative to the control non-binder, the TRAIL-R2 specific binder exhibited activity in the assay, which decreased slightly in the presence of the secondary antibody. FIG. 22.

In this experiment, 5 of 8 charge mutants of the Tn3 scaffold (E33Q, D49N, E52Q, D53N, E86Q) required a higher concentration of urea to effect unfolding as compared to the wild type Tn3 scaffold.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The protein scaffolds described herein have been designed to be superior both to antibody-derived fragments and to non-antibody frameworks. The major advantage of the scaffolds of the invention over antibody fragments is structural. These scaffolds are derived from whole, stable, and soluble structural modules found in human body fluid proteins and from other sources in nature (for example, but not limited, to thermophilic bacteria). Consequently, they exhibit better folding and thermostability properties than antibody fragments, whose creation involves the removal of parts of the antibody native fold, often exposing amino acid residues that, in an intact antibody, would be buried in a hydrophobic environment, such as an interface between variable and constant domains. Exposure of such hydrophobic residues to solvent increases the likelihood of aggregation. Moreover, the scaffolds of the invention provide the functional advantages of antibody molecules. In particular, despite the fact that the scaffold is not an immunoglobulin, its overall fold is close to that of the variable region of the IgG heavy chain, making it possible to display its three loops in an analogous fashion to antibody CDRs in relative orientations. Because of this structure, the scaffolds of the invention possess antigen binding properties that are similar in nature and affinity to those of antibodies. As a result, loop randomization and shuffling strategies may be employed in vitro that are similar to the process of affinity maturation of antibodies in vivo. 7.1 The FnIII Structural Motif The scaffolds of the present invention are based on the structure of a fibronectin module of type III (FnIII), a domain found in mammalian blood and structural proteins. This domain occurs often in the proteins sequenced to date, including fibronectins, tenascin, intracellular cytoskeletal proteins, cytokine receptors and prokaryotic enzymes (Bork and Doolittle, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:8990, 1992; Bork et al., Nature Biotech. 15:553, 1997; Meinke et al., J. Bacteriol. 175:1910, 1993; Watanabe et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265:15659, 1990). Although the domain appears many times in nature, the amino acid sequences are quite divergent. In particular, these scaffolds include, the third FnIII domain of tenascin C (also known as the “Tn3” domain). The overall fold of this domain is closely related to that of the smallest functional antibody fragment, the variable region of the heavy chain, which comprises the entire antigen recognition unit in camel and llama IgG. In addition, the Tn3 domain possesses exposed loop sequences tolerant of randomization, facilitating the generation of diverse pools of protein scaffolds capable of binding specific targets with high affinity. These protein scaffolds may be utilized for the purpose of designing proteins which are capable of binding to virtually any compound (for example, any protein) of interest. In particular, the molecules based on the Tn3 structural motif described herein may be used as scaffolds which are subjected to directed evolution designed to randomize one or more of the loops which are analogous to the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of an antibody variable region. Such a directed evolution approach results in the production of antibody-like molecules with high affinities for antigens of interest. In addition, the scaffolds described herein may be used to display defined exposed loops (for example, loops previously randomized and selected on the basis of antigen binding) in order to direct the evolution of molecules that bind to such introduced loops. A selection of this type may be carried out to identify recognition molecules for any individual CDR-like loop or, alternatively, for the recognition of two or all three CDR-like loops combined into a non-linear epitope binding moiety. A set of three loops of Tn3 corresponding to the antigen-binding loops of the IgG heavy chain run between amino acid residues 23-31 (BC), 50-56 (DE), and 75-84 (FG). The length of the BC, DE, and FG loops, 9, 6, and 10 residues, respectively, fall within the narrow range of the corresponding antigen-recognition loops found in antibody heavy chains, that is, 7-10, 4-8, and 4-28 residue lengths, respectively. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the BC, DE, and FG loops may run between amino acid residues 23 to 31, 51 to 56, and 75 to 84 respectively. Accordingly, once randomized and selected for high antigen affinity, these loops may make contacts with antigens equivalent to the contacts of the corresponding loops in antibodies. The AB, CD, and EF loops of the Tn3 domain also share this property and hence, also are available for randomization and selection for high affinity for antigens. This process may be accomplished in parallel or in series with the randomization of the BC, DE, and FG loops. In a specific embodiment, one or more loop regions of the scaffold based on the Tn3 domain of human tenascin C comprise amino acid residues: I. From 12 to 17 inclusive in an AB loop;II.

However, disulfide design by manual inspection of protein structures to identify candidate residue pairs in close proximity is often unproductive due to the strict geometric constraints required by that type of bond (see Dombkowski, Bioinformatics Vol. 19 No. 14, 2003 1852-1853). Thus, the present invention provides scaffolds having disulfide bonds engineered at positions that exhibit enhanced stability as measured by thermal tolerance, resistance to chaotropic denaturation and protease treatment. In one embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention comprise at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, or at least five non-naturally occurring disulfide bonds. In one embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention comprise a least one non-naturally occurring disulfide bond, wherein said at least one non-naturally occurring disulfide bond stabilizes the scaffold. In another embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention comprise at least one non-naturally occurring disulfide bond located between two beta strands. For example, said at least one non-naturally occurring disulfide bond may form a link between the A strand and B strand, or between the D strand and E strand, or between the F strand and G strand, or between the C strand and F strand. In another embodiment, said at least one non-naturally occurring disulfide bond forms a first bond between the F strand and the G strand, and a second link between the C strand and F strand. In another embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention comprise at least one non-naturally occurring disulfide bond located between two loop regions. In another embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention comprise at least one non-naturally occurring disulfide bond located between a loop region and a beta strand. In another embodiment, scaffolds of the invention comprise at least one non-naturally occurring disulfide bond that is located within the same beta strand. In another embodiment, scaffolds of the invention comprise at least one non-naturally occurring disulfide bond that is located within the same loop region. In another embodiment, scaffolds of the invention comprise at least one non-naturally occurring disulfide bond, wherein the bond is located between two distinct scaffolds. In another embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention comprise a disulfide bond that forms a multimeric scaffold (the term “multimeric” is defined as at least two or more scaffolds in association) of at least 2, at least 3, at least 4 or more scaffolds. The increase in stability contributed by the engineering of disulfide bonds can be readily measured by techniques well known in the art, such as thermal (Tm) and chaotropic denaturation (such as urea, or guanidine), protease treatment (such as thermolysin) or another art accepted stability parameter. A comprehensive review of techniques used to measure protein stability can be found, for example in “Current Protocols in Molecular Biology” and “Current Protocols in Protein Science” by John Wiley and Sons. 2007. In one embodiment the disulfide containing scaffolds of the invention exhibit an increase in stability of at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95% or more compared to the same scaffold prior to disulfide engineering, as measured by thermal tolerance, resistance to chaotropic denaturation, protease treatment or another stability parameter well-known in the art. The stability of a protein may be measured by the level of fluorescence exhibited by the protein under varying conditions. There is a positive correlation between the relative unfoldedness of a protein and a change in the internal fluorescence the protein exhibits under stress. Suitable protein stability assays to measure thermal characteristics include Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Circular Dichroism (CD). When the protein demonstrates a sizable shift in parameters measured by DSC or CD, it correlates to an unfolded structure, the temperature at which this shift is made is termed the melting temperature or (Tm). In one embodiment, the disulfide engineered scaffolds of the invention exhibit an increased melting temperature (Tm) of at least greater than 45° C., at least greater than 50° C., at least greater than 55° C., at least greater than 60° C., at least greater than 65° C., at least greater than 70° C., at least greater than 71° C., at least greater than 72° C., at least greater than 73° C., at least greater than 74° C., at least greater than 75° C., at least greater than 76° C., at least greater than 77° C., at least greater than 78° C., at least greater than 79° C., at least greater than 80° C., at least greater than 81° C., at least greater than 82° C., at least greater than 83° C., at least greater than 84° C., at least greater than 85° C., at least greater than 85° C., at least greater than 86° C., at least greater than 87° C., at least greater than 88° C., at least greater than 89° C., at least greater than 90° C., at least greater than 91° C., at least greater than 92° C., at least greater than 93° C., at least greater than 94° C., at least greater than 94° C., at least greater than, at least greater than 95° C., at least greater than 96° C., at least greater than 97° C. or at least greater than 98° C., or at least greater than 100° C., or at least greater than 105°, or at least greater than 110°, or at least greater than 120° than the melting temperature (Tm) exhibited by the same scaffold prior to engineering under the same experimental conditions. In another embodiment, the disulfide engineered scaffolds of the invention exhibit an increased melting temperature (Tm) of at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95% or more compared to the same scaffold prior to disulfide engineering under the same experimental conditions. Another assay for protein stability involves exposing a protein to a chaotropic agent, such as urea or guanidine (for example, guanidine-HCl or guanidine isothiocynate) which acts to destabilize interactions within the protein. Upon exposing the protein to increasing levels of urea or guanidine, the relative internal fluorescence is measured to asses a value in which 50% of the protein molecules are unfolded. This value is termed the Cm value and represents a benchmark value for protein stability. The higher the Cm value, the more stable the protein. In one embodiment, the disulfide engineered scaffolds of the invention exhibit an increased Cm at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95% or more compared to the same scaffold prior to disulfide engineering as measured in a urea denaturation experiment under similar conditions. In another embodiment, the disulfide engineered scaffolds of the invention exhibit an increased Cm at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95% or more compared to the same scaffold prior to disulfide engineering as measured in a guanidine denaturation experiment under similar conditions. Another assay used to assay protein stability is a protease resistance assay. In this assay, a relative level of protein stability is correlated with the resistance to protease degradation over time. The more resistant to protease treatment, the more stable the protein is. In one embodiment, the disulfide engineered scaffolds of the invention exhibit increased stability by at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95% or more compared to the same scaffold prior to disulfide engineering as measured in a protease resistance experiment under similar conditions. In some instances it may be advantageous to utilize a scaffold of the invention with decreased stability, for example but not limited to, a scaffold conjugated to a cytotoxin, or a radionuclide. Such scaffolds may require faster clearance rates related to non-specific toxicity. In one embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention comprise a disulfide bond that de-stabilizes the scaffold as compared to the scaffold prior to engineering. In one embodiment the disulfide containing scaffolds of the invention exhibit a decrease in stability of at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95% or more compared to the same scaffold prior to disulfide engineering, as measured by thermal tolerance, resistance to chaotropic denaturation, protease treatment or another stability parameter well-known in the art under similar experimental conditions. 7.3 Scaffold Kinetics The invention provides scaffolds that specifically bind a target (for example, a protein).

In one particular example, the target is immobilized on a solid support, such as a column resin or microtiter plate well, and the target contacted with a library of candidate scaffold-based binding proteins. Such a library may consist of clones constructed from the Tn3 motif based scaffold through randomization of the sequence and/or the length of the CDR-like loops. In one embodiment, the library may be a phage, phagemid, virus, bacterial or yeast display or a ribosome display library. If desired, this library may be an RNA-protein fusion library generated, for example, by the techniques described in Szostak et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,258,558 B1, U.S. Pat. No. 6,261,804 B1; U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,768 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,754. Alternatively, it may be a DNA-protein library (for example, as described in Lohse, DNA-Protein Fusions and Uses Thereof, U.S. Ser. No. 60/110,549, filed Dec. 2, 1998, now abandoned, and U.S. Ser. No. 09/453,190, filed Dec. 2, 1999). In this regard, bacteriophage (phage) display is one well known technique which allows one to screen large oligopeptide libraries to identify member(s) of those libraries which are capable of specifically binding to a target. Phage display is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to the coat protein on the surface of bacteriophage particles (Scott, J. K. and Smith, G. P. (1990) Science 249: 386). The utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of selectively randomized protein variants (or randomly cloned cDNAs) can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Display of peptide (Cwirla, S. E. et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:6378) or protein (Lowman, H. B. et al. (1991) Biochemistry, 30:10832; Clackson, T. et al. (1991) Nature, 352: 624; Marks, J. D. et al. (1991), J. Mol. Biol., 222:581; Kang, A. S. et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88:8363) libraries on phage have been used for screening millions of polypeptides or oligopeptides for ones with specific binding properties (Smith, G. P. (1991) Current Opin. Biotechnol., 2:668). Sorting phage libraries of random mutants requires a strategy for constructing and propagating a large number of variants, a procedure for affinity purification using the target receptor, and a means of evaluating the results of binding enrichments (see for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,223,409, 5,403,484, 5,571,689, and 5,663,143). Although most phage display methods have used filamentous phage, lambdoid phage display systems (WO 95/34683; U.S. Pat. No. 5,627,024), T4 phage display systems (Ren et al., Gene, 215: 439 (1998); Zhu et al., Cancer Research, 58(15): 3209-3214 (1998); Jiang et al., Infection & Immunity, 65(11): 4770-4777 (1997); Ren et al., Gene, 195(2):303-311 (1997); Ren, Protein Sci., 5: 1833 (1996); Efimov et al., Virus Genes, 10: 173 (1995)) and T7 phage display systems (Smith and Scott, Methods in Enzymology, 217: 228-257 (1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,905) are also known. Many other improvements and variations of the basic phage display concept have now been developed. These improvements enhance the ability of display systems to screen peptide libraries for binding to selected target molecules and to display functional proteins with the potential of screening these proteins for desired properties. Combinatorial reaction devices for phage display reactions have been developed (WO 98/14277) and phage display libraries have been used to analyze and control bimolecular interactions (WO 98/20169; WO 98/20159) and properties of constrained helical peptides (WO 98/20036). WO 97/35196 describes a method of isolating an affinity ligand in which a phage display library is contacted with one solution in which the ligand will bind to a target molecule and a second solution in which the affinity ligand will not bind to the target molecule, to selectively isolate binding ligands. WO 97/46251 describes a method of biopanning a random phage display library with an affinity purified antibody and then isolating binding phage, followed by a micropanning process using microplate wells to isolate high affinity binding phage. The use of Staphlylococcus aureus protein A as an affinity tag has also been reported (Li et al. (1998) Mol Biotech., 9:187). WO 97/47314 describes the use of substrate subtraction libraries to distinguish enzyme specificities using a combinatorial library which may be a phage display library. A method for selecting enzymes suitable for use in detergents using phage display is described in WO 97/09446. Additional methods of selecting specific binding proteins are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,498,538, 5,432,018, and WO 98/15833. Methods of generating peptide libraries and screening these libraries are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,723,286, 5,432,018, 5,580,717, 5,427,908, 5,498,530, 5,770,434, 5,734,018, 5,698,426, 5,763,192, and 5,723,323. For the present libraries of the invention, a bioinformatics approach was employed to determine the loop length and diversity preferences of naturally occurring Tn3 structural motifs (see Example 2). During this analysis, the preferences for loop length and sequence diversity were employed to develop a “restricted randomization” approach. In this restricted randomization, the relative loop length and sequence preferences were incorporated into the development of a library strategy. For example, it was determined, that one loop length preference for the BC loop was 9 residues. Upon further analysis of 9 residue containing BC loops it was determined whether there was a preference for a particular amino acid, or group of amino acids at that position or if the position was completely random. Integrating the loop length and sequence diversity analysis into library development resulted in a restricted randomization (i.e. certain positions within the randomized loop were limited in which amino acid could reside in that position). Examples of the restricted randomization approach are described in the Examples (see Example 2). The invention also provides libraries (hereinafter referred to as “libraries of the invention”) comprising scaffolds of the invention described herein. In one embodiment, the libraries of the invention comprise non-naturally occurring polypeptide scaffolds comprising, a plurality of beta strand domains linked to a plurality of loop region sequences derived from a naturally occurring protein sequence, wherein one or more of said loop region sequences vary by deletion, substitution or addition by at least one amino acid from the corresponding loop sequences in the naturally occurring protein sequence, and wherein the beta strand domains of the polypeptide scaffold have at least 50% homology to the corresponding domain sequences of a naturally occurring protein sequence. In some embodiments the naturally occurring sequence is the protein sequence corresponding to human tenascin Tn3. In other embodiments, the naturally occurring sequence is a protein sequence corresponding to an additional Tn3 structural motif from human tenascin C. In other embodiments, the naturally occurring sequence is a protein sequence corresponding to a Tn3 structural motif from another tenascin protein, or alternatively, a tenascin protein from another organism (such as, but not limited to, murine, porcine, bovine, or equine tenascins). In yet another embodiment, the naturally occurring sequence is a protein sequence corresponding to a Tn3 structural motif from any organism. In other embodiments, the naturally occurring sequence corresponds to a predicted Tn3 structural motif from a thermophilic organism, for example, but not limited to Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Staphylothermus marinus, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, Sulfolobus solfataricus, and Sulfolobus tokodaii. In yet another embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention have a protein sequence having at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95% or at least 99% homology to any of the sequences corresponding to a Tn3 structural motif or a predicted Tn3 structural motif as described above. The library is incubated with the immobilized target, the support is washed to remove non-specific binders, and the tightest binders are eluted under very stringent conditions and subjected to PCR to recover the sequence information or to create a new library of binders which may be used to repeat the selection process, with or without further mutagenesis of the sequence. A number of rounds of selection may be performed until binders of sufficient affinity for the antigen are obtained. In another embodiment, the libraries of the invention comprise scaffolds described herein.

In a specific embodiment, the libraries of the invention comprise scaffolds further comprising one or more loop regions of the scaffold based on the Tn3 domain of human tenascin C comprising amino acid residues: I. from 12 to 17 inclusive in an AB loop;II. from 23 to 31 inclusive in an BC loop;III. from 39 to 45 inclusive in an CD loop;IV. from 50 to 56 inclusive in an DE loop;V. from 60 to 66 inclusive in an EF loop; andVI. from 75 to 84 inclusive in an FG loop. In another specific embodiment, libraries of the invention comprise scaffolds further comprising one or more loop regions of the scaffold based on the Tn3 domain of human tenascin C comprising amino acid residues: I.

In a specific embodiment, the libraries of the invention comprise scaffolds with an AB loop, comprising 9 residues, which is randomized with the following consensus sequence: K-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-a, wherein X represents asparagine, aspartic acid, histidine, tyrosine, isoleucine, valine, leucine, phenylalanine, threonine, alanine, proline, or serine, and wherein (a) represents serine, threonine, alanine, or glycine. In a specific embodiment, the libraries of the invention comprise scaffolds with a CD loop, comprising 7, 8, or 9 residues, wherein each residue in the CD loop is randomized and wherein X represents asparagine, aspartic acid, histidine, tyrosine, isoleucine, valine, leucine, phenylalanine, threonine, alanine, proline, or serine. In a specific embodiment, the libraries of the invention comprise scaffolds with an EF loop comprising 8 residues, which is randomized with the following consensus sequence: X-b-L-X-P-X-c-X, wherein X represents asparagine, aspartic acid, histidine, tyrosine, isoleucine, valine, leucine, phenylalanine, threonine, alanine, proline, or serine, and wherein (b) represents asparagine, lysine, serine, arginine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or glycine, and wherein (c) represents isoleucine, threonine, serine, valine, alanine, or glycine. A further embodiment of the invention is a collection of isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding a library comprising the scaffolds of the invention and as described above. A further practical consideration in the design of these Tn3 libraries was to identify an alternative to the “NNK” (N=A, G, T, C; K=G, T) mixed codon scheme typically used in degenerate oligonucleotides to code for any amino acid. Although the “NNK” mixture gives 32 different codons which code for all 20 amino acids, they are not encoded equally (Table 11). For instance, 3/32 codons in the “NNK” scheme code for Leu (CTG, CTT, TTG), but only 1/32 codes for Asp (GAT). In addition, the “NNK” mixture encodes one stop codon (TAG) and a Cys codon (TGT), neither of which is desirable when generating naive libraries. In considering an alternative scheme, we took note of the fact that synthetic antibody libraries have been described which encode CDR sequences composed of a small subset of amino acids. Antibody libraries with CDR's composed of just 4 amino acids (Tyr, Ala, Asp, Ser), or even a binary pair (Tyr, Ser) have been shown to yield specific high affinity mAbs to protein antigens (Fellouse et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci, 2004, 101:12467-72, Fellouse et al. J. Mol. Biol., 2005, 348:1153-62). Similarly, a library of 10Fn3 scaffold proteins with randomized loop sequences comprising just Tyr and Ser also yielded specific binders to a protein target (Koide et al. Proc Natl Acad, Sci, 2007, 104:66-32-7). Although libraries containing highly restricted sets of amino acids are able to produce specific binding proteins, it is likely that the diversity of binders that are obtained from a library will be limited. We therefore designed an alternate “NHT” mixed codon scheme for introducing diversity into a Tn3 library (H=A, T, C). “NHT” mixes code for a reasonable subset of the 20 amino acids, but avoid the disadvantages described with “NNK” mixed codons (Table 12). This scheme generates 12 codons that code for 12/20 amino acids, that is, each codon codes for a unique amino acid. Moreover, there are no stop or Cys codons. Accordingly, in some embodiments, scaffolds of the invention comprise codons encoded by the NHT codon scheme. In other embodiments, scaffolds of the invention comprise codons encoded by the NNK mixed codon scheme. In other embodiments, the scaffolds of the invention may be subjected to affinity maturation. In this art-accepted process, a specific binding protein is subject to a scheme that selects for increased affinity for a specific target (see Wu et al. Proc Natl Aca Sci USA. May 1998 26; 95(11):6037-42). The resultant scaffolds of the invention may exhibit binding characteristics at least as high as compared to the scaffolds prior to affinity maturation. In other embodiments, the scaffolds of the invention may be subjected to “loop grafting” analogous to CDR grafting for antibodies. In this art-accepted process, one or more CDRs from an antibody are “grafted” onto an acceptor antibody (or, in this example, a scaffold of the invention (see Ewert et al. Methods: 2004 October; 34(2):184-99). In another embodiment, at least one loop from another scaffold may be grafted onto a scaffold of the invention. The invention also provides methods of identifying the amino acid sequence of a protein scaffold capable of binding to target so as to form a scaffold:target complex. In one embodiment, the method comprises the steps of: a) providing a polypeptide display library of the invention; b) contacting the polypeptide display library of (a) with an immobilized or separable target; c) separating the scaffold:target complexes from the free scaffolds; d) causing the replication of the separated scaffolds of (c) so as to result in a new polypeptide display library distinguished from that in (a) by having a lowered diversity and by being enriched in displayed scaffolds capable of binding the target; e) optionally repeating steps (b), (c), and (d) with the new library of (d); and f) determining the nucleic acid sequence of the region encoding the displayed scaffold of a species from (d) and hence deducing the peptide sequence capable of binding to the target.

In one embodiment, methods of the invention comprise further randomizing at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five or at least six loops of a scaffold identified from a library using a method described herein. In another embodiment, the further randomized scaffold is subjected to a subsequent method of identifying a scaffold capable of binding a target, said method comprising (a) contacting said further randomized scaffold with an immobilized or separable target, (b) separating the further randomized scaffold:target complexes from the free scaffolds, (c) causing the replication of the separated scaffolds of (b), optionally repeating steps (a)-(c), and (d) determining the nucleic acid sequence of the region encoding said further randomized scaffold and hence, deducing the peptide sequence capable of binding to the target. In a further embodiment, the further randomized scaffolds comprise at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, or at least six randomized loops which were previously randomized in the first library. In an alternate further embodiment, the further randomized scaffolds comprise at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, or at least six randomized loops which were not previously randomized in the first library. In another embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention may be further randomized after identification from a library screen. In one embodiment, methods of the invention comprise further randomizing at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six or at least seven strands of a scaffold identified from a library using a method described herein. In another embodiment, the further randomized scaffold is subjected to a subsequent method of identifying a scaffold capable of binding a target, said method comprising (a) contacting said further randomized scaffold with an immobilized or separable target, (b) separating the further randomized scaffold:target complexes from the free scaffolds, (c) causing the replication of the separated scaffolds of (b), optionally repeating steps (a)-(c), and (d) determining the nucleic acid sequence of the region encoding said further randomized scaffold and hence, deducing the peptide sequence capable of binding to the target. In a further embodiment, the further randomized scaffolds comprise at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, or at least seven randomized strands which were previously randomized in the first library. In an alternate further embodiment, the further randomized scaffolds comprise at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, or at least seven randomized strands which were not previously randomized in the first library. In another embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention may be further randomized after identification from a library screen. In one embodiment, methods of the invention comprise further randomizing at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, or at least six and at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, or at least seven strands of a scaffold identified from a library using a method described herein. In another embodiment, the further randomized scaffold is subjected to a subsequent method of identifying a scaffold capable of binding a target, said method comprising (a) contacting said further randomized scaffold with an immobilized or separable target, (b) separating the further randomized scaffold:target complexes from the free scaffolds, (c) causing the replication of the separated scaffolds of (b), optionally repeating steps (a)-(c), and (d) determining the nucleic acid sequence of the region encoding said further randomized scaffold and hence, deducing the peptide sequence capable of binding to the target. In a further embodiment, the further randomized scaffolds comprise at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, or at least six randomized loops and at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, or at least seven strands which were previously randomized in the first library. In an alternate further embodiment, the further randomized scaffolds comprise at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, or at least six randomized loops and at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, or at least seven strands which were not previously randomized in the first library. In another embodiment, one method of obtaining a scaffold of the invention involves a first randomized loop selected from the group consisting of BC, DE, and FG loops and a second loop not randomized in said library selected from the group consisting of AB, CD, and EF loops. In yet another embodiment, another method of obtaining a scaffold of the invention involves a first randomized loop selected from the group consisting of AB, CD, EF loops and a second loop not randomized in said library selected from the group consisting of BC, DE, and FG loops. The invention also provides a method obtaining at least two scaffolds that bind to at least one or more targets. This method allows for the screening of agents that act cooperatively to elicit a particular response. It may be advantageous to use such a screen when an agonistic activity requiring the cooperation of more than one scaffold is required (for example, but not limited to, agonism of a receptor tyrosine kinase). This method allows for the screening of cooperative agents without the reformatting of the library to form multimeric complexes. In one embodiment, the method of the invention comprises contacting a target ligand with a library of the invention under conditions that allow a scaffold:target ligand complex to form, engaging said scaffolds with a crosslinking agent (defined as an agent that brings together, in close proximity, at least two identical or distinct scaffolds) wherein the crosslinking of the scaffolds elicits a detectable response and obtaining from the complex, said scaffolds that bind the target. In a further embodiment, the crosslinking agent is a scaffold specific antibody, or fragment thereof, an epitope tag specific antibody of a fragment thereof, a dimerization domain, such as Fc region, a leucine zipper motif, a chemical crosslinker, or another dimerization domain known in the art. The invention also provides methods of detecting a compound utilizing the scaffolds of the invention. Based on the binding specificities of the scaffolds obtained by library screening, it is possible to use such scaffolds in assays to detect the specific target in a sample, such as for diagnostic methods. In one embodiment, the method of detecting a compound comprises contacting said compound in a sample with a scaffold of the invention, under conditions that allow a compound:scaffold complex to form and detecting said scaffold, thereby detecting said compound in a sample. In further embodiments, the scaffold is labeled (i.e. radiolabel, fluorescent, enzyme-linked or colorimetric label) to facilitate the detection of said compound. The invention also provides methods of capturing a compound utilizing the scaffolds of the invention. Based on the binding specificities of the scaffolds obtained by library screening, it is possible to use such scaffolds in assays to capture the specific target in a sample, such as for purification methods. In one embodiment, the method of capturing a compound in a sample comprises contacting said compound in a sample with a scaffold of the invention under conditions that allow the formation of a compound:scaffold complex and removing said complex from the sample, thereby capturing said compound in said sample. In further embodiments, the scaffold is immobilized to facilitate the removing of the compound:scaffold complex. In some embodiments, scaffolds isolated from libraries of the invention comprise at least one, at least two, at least four, at least five, at least six, or more randomized loop regions. In some embodiments, isolated scaffold loop sequences may be swapped from a donor scaffold to any loop in a receiver scaffold (for example, an AB loop sequence from a donor scaffold may be transferred to an y loop region in a receiver scaffold). In specific embodiments, an isolated loop sequences may be transferred to the cognate loop in the receiving scaffold (for example, an AB loop sequence from a donor scaffold may be transferred to a receiver scaffold in the AB loop position). In some embodiments, isolated loop sequences may be “mix and matched” randomly with various receiver scaffolds. In other embodiments, isolated scaffolds sequences may be identified by the loop sequence. For example, a library is used to pan against a particular target and an collection of specific binders are isolated. The randomized loop sequences may be characterized as specific sequences independently of the scaffold background (i.e., The scaffold that binds target X wherein said scaffold comprises an AB loop sequence of SEQ ID NO:x). In alternative embodiments, where a scaffold exhibits two loop sequences that bind target X, the loop sequences may be characterized as binding target X in the absence of the scaffold sequence. In other words, it is contemplated that scaffolds isolated from a library that bind a particular target may be expressed as the variable loop sequences that bind that target independent of the scaffold backbone. This process would be analogous to the concept of CDRs in variable regions of antibodies. In some embodiments, the invention provides scaffolds comprising sequences that specifically bind SYNAGIS®. In such embodiments, scaffolds of the invention that specifically bind SYNAGIS® may comprise an BC loop sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs:100, 102, 105, 107, and 109. In other embodiments, scaffolds of the invention that specifically bind SYNAGIS® may comprise an FG loop sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs:101, 103, 104, 106, 108, or 110. In further embodiments, scaffolds of the invention that specifically bind SYNAGIS® may comprise at least one BC loop sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs:100, 102, 105, 107, and 109; and may comprise at least one FG loop sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs:101, 103, 104, 106, 108, or 110. In other embodiments, the invention may also comprise scaffolds which compete for binding with scaffolds that specifically bind SYNAGIS®, said SYNAGIS® binders comprising one BC loop sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs:100, 102, 105, 107, and 109; and comprising an FG loop sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs:101, 103, 104, 106, 108, or 110. Competition assays may be performed as presented herein in Examples 11 and/or 14, or by other assays known in the art. In some embodiments, the invention provides scaffolds comprising sequences that specifically bind lysozyme. In such embodiments, scaffolds of the invention that specifically bind lysozyme may comprise at least one BC loop sequence selected from SED ID NOs:111, 114, 102, 120, and 124. In other embodiments, scaffolds of the invention that specifically bind lysozyme may comprise at least one FG loop sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs: 112, 113, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 122, or 125. In further embodiments, scaffolds of the invention that specifically bind lysozyme may comprise at least one BC loop sequence selected from SED ID NOs:111, 114, 102, 120, and 124; and may comprise at least one FG loop sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs: 112, 113, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 122, or 125. In other embodiments, the invention may also comprise scaffolds which compete for binding with scaffolds that bind lysozyme, said lysozyme binders comprising at least one BC loop sequence selected from SED ID NOs:111, 114, 102, 120, or 124; and at least one FG loop sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs: 112, 113, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 122, or 125. Competition assays may be performed as presented herein in Examples 11 and/or 14, or by other assays known in the art. 7.5 Multimeric Scaffolds In addition to scaffold monomers, any of the scaffold constructs described herein may be generated as dimers or multimers of scaffolds as a means to increase the valency and thus the avidity of antigen binding. Also, any of the scaffold constructs described herein may be generated as dimers or multimers of scaffolds as a means to increase the specificity of antigen binding (for example, scaffolds may be generated that bind distinct antigens). Such multimers (multimeric scaffolds or also known herein as multivalent scaffolds) may be generated through covalent binding between individual scaffold modules, for example, by the inclusion of an amino acid linker. In other methods, the multimeric scaffolds may be assembled through use of dimerization domains known in the art. In particular examples, covalently bonded scaffolds may be generated by constructing fusion genes that encode the monomeric scaffolds or, alternatively, by engineering codons for cysteine residues into monomer sequences and allowing disulfide bond formation to occur between the expression products. Non-covalently bonded multimeric scaffolds may also be generated by a variety of techniques. These include the introduction, into monomer sequences, of codons corresponding to positively and/or negatively charged residues and allowing interactions between these residues in the expression products (and therefore between the monomers) to occur. This approach may be simplified by taking advantage of charged residues naturally present in a monomer subunit. Another means for generating non-covalently bonded scaffolds is to introduce, into the monomer scaffold gene (for example, at the amino- or carboxy-termini), the coding sequences for proteins or protein domains known to interact. Such proteins or protein domains include coil-coil motifs, leucine zipper motifs, and any of the numerous protein subunits (or fragments thereof) known to direct formation of dimers or higher order multimers. In some embodiments, multimeric scaffolds of the invention comprise at least one scaffold fused to any domain (or fragment) of an antibody. In some embodiments, at least one scaffold is fused to an antibody variable domain, a CH1 domain, a Ckappa domain, a Clambda domain, a CH2, or a CH3 domain. In other embodiments, at least one scaffold is fused to the CH2 domain of an antibody Fc. In such embodiments, the resulting protein, when expressed will be bivalent for a particular target through the dimerization of the CH2 and CH3 regions of the antibody Fc fragment. In further embodiments, the scaffold of the invention replaces the antibody variable region connected to the Fc fragment. In alternative embodiments, the scaffold of the invention does not replace the antibody variable region connected to the CH1-Fc fragment, Ckappa or Clambda domains. In further embodiments, multimeric scaffolds are constructed by fusing scaffolds to the CH1 and the Ckappa or Clamdba regions of an antibody. In some embodiments, the scaffolds of the invention replace the antibody variable regions fused to the CH1 and the Ckappa or Clambda regions of an antibody. In further embodiments, scaffolds of the invention may be fused to the C-terminus of the light chain or heavy chain of an antibody. In other embodiments, scaffolds of the invention may be fused to the N-terminus of the light chain or heavy chain of an antibody. In some embodiments, multimeric scaffolds of the invention comprise scaffolds that are specific for the same epitope. In other embodiments, multimeric scaffolds of the invention comprise scaffolds that are specific for different epitopes otherwise known as an epitope binding domain. Multimeric scaffolds of the invention may be assembled and utilized as shown in “Multispecific epitope binding proteins and uses thereof” U.S. application Ser. No. 12/182,975, filed Jul. 30, 2008 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. Such epitope binding domains may be selected from an antibody, an antibody fragment, a diabody, an scFv, a Fab, a Fv, or a binding peptide. In other embodiments, the epitope binding domain will be specific for the same target as that of the scaffold of the invention. In another embodiment, the epitope binding domain will be specific for a different target as that of the scaffold of the invention. Choosing a suitable linker for a specific case where two or more scaffolds are to be connected may depend on a variety of parameters including, e.g. the nature of the monomer domains, and/or the stability of the peptide linker towards proteolysis and oxidation. The linker polypeptide may predominantly include amino acid residues selected from the group consisting of Gly, Ser, Ala and Thr. For example, the peptide linker may contain at least 75% (calculated on the basis of the total number of residues present in the peptide linker), such as at least 80%, e.g. at least 85% or at least 90% of amino acid residues selected from the group consisting of Gly, Ser, Ala and Thr. The peptide linker may also consist of Gly, Ser, Ala and/or Thr residues only. The linker polypeptide should have a length, which is adequate to link two or more monomer domains of the invention or two or more multimeric scaffolds of the invention in such a way that they assume the correct conformation relative to one another so that they retain the desired activity. A suitable length for this purpose is a length of at least one and typically fewer than about 50 amino acid residues, such as 2-25 amino acid residues, 5-20 amino acid residues, 5-15 amino acid residues, 8-12 amino acid residues or 11 residues. Similarly, the polypeptide encoding a linker can range in size, e.g., from about 2 to about 15 amino acids, from about 3 to about 15, from about 4 to about 12, about 10, about 8, or about 6 amino acids. In methods and compositions involving nucleic acids, such as DNA, RNA, or combinations of both, the polynucleotide containing the linker sequence can be, e.g., between about 6 nucleotides and about 45 nucleotides, between about 9 nucleotides and about 45 nucleotides, between about 12 nucleotides and about 36 nucleotides, about 30 nucleotides, about 24 nucleotides, or about 18 nucleotides. Likewise, the amino acid residues selected for inclusion in the linker polypeptide should exhibit properties that do not interfere significantly with the activity or function of the polypeptide multimer. Thus, the peptide linker should on the whole not exhibit a charge which would be inconsistent with the activity or function of the polypeptide multimer, or interfere with internal folding, or form bonds or other interactions with amino acid residues in one or more of the monomer domains which would seriously impede the binding of the polypeptide multimer to specific targets. The peptide linker may also be selected from a library where the amino acid residues in the peptide linker are randomized for a specific set of monomer domains in a particular polypeptide multimer. A flexible linker could be used to find suitable combinations of monomer domains, which is then optimized using this random library of variable linkers to obtain linkers with optimal length and geometry. The optimal linkers may contain the minimal number of amino acid residues of the right type that participate in the binding to the target and restrict the movement of the monomer domains relative to each other in the polypeptide multimer when not bound to specific targets. The use of naturally occurring as well as artificial peptide linkers to connect polypeptides into novel linked fusion polypeptides is well known in the literature (Hallewell et al. (1989), J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5260-5268; Alfthan et al. (1995), Protein Eng. 8, 725-731; Robinson & Sauer (1996), Biochemistry 35, 109-116; Khandekar et al. (1997), J. Biol. Chem. 272, 32190-32197; Fares et al. (1998), Endocrinology 139, 2459-2464; Smallshaw et al. (1999), Protein Eng. 12, 623-630; U.S. Pat. No. 5,856,456). As mentioned above, it is generally preferred that the peptide linker possess at least some flexibility. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the peptide linker contains 1-25 glycine residues, 5-20 glycine residues, 5-15 glycine residues or 8-12 glycine residues. The peptide linker will typically contain at least 50% glycine residues, such as at least 75% glycine residues. In some embodiments of the invention, the peptide linker comprises glycine residues only. In specific embodiments, linker sequences may comprise a sequence of (G-G-G-G-S)x (SEQ ID NO: 260) where x is a positive integer. In another specific embodiment, linker sequences may comprise a sequence of (G-A)x where x is a positive integer. In another specific embodiment, linker sequences may comprise a sequence of (G-G-G-T-P-T)x (SEQ ID NO: 261) where x is a positive integer. In some cases it may be desirable or necessary to provide some rigidity into the peptide linker. This may be accomplished by including proline residues in the amino acid sequence of the peptide linker. Thus, in another embodiment of the invention, the peptide linker may comprise at least one proline residue in the amino acid sequence of the peptide linker. For example, the peptide linker has an amino acid sequence, wherein at least 25%, such as at least 50%, e.g. at least 75%, of the amino acid residues are proline residues. In one particular embodiment of the invention, the peptide linker comprises proline residues only. In some embodiments of the invention, the peptide linker is modified in such a way that an amino acid residue comprising an attachment group for a non-polypeptide moiety is introduced. Examples of such amino acid residues may be a cysteine residue (to which the non-polypeptide moiety is then subsequently attached) or the amino acid sequence may include an in vivo N-glycosylation site (thereby attaching a sugar moiety (in vivo) to the peptide linker). An additional option is to genetically incorporate non-natural amino acids using evolved tRNAs and tRNA synthetases (see, e.g., U.S. patent application Publication Ser. No. 2003/0082575) into the monomer domains or linkers. For example, insertion of keto-tyrosine allows for site-specific coupling to expressed monomer domains or multimers. Sometimes, the amino acid sequences of all peptide linkers present in the polypeptide multimer will be identical. Alternatively, the amino acid sequences of all peptide linkers present in the polypeptide multimer may be different. 7.6 Fusions The scaffolds described herein may be fused to other protein domains. For example, these scaffolds may be integrated with the human immune response by fusing the constant region of an IgG (Fc) with a scaffold, through the N or C-terminus. The Fc fusion molecule activates the complement component of the immune response and increases the therapeutic value of the protein scaffold. Similarly, a fusion between a scaffold and a complement protein, such as Clq, may be used to target cells, and a fusion between scaffold and a toxin may be used to specifically destroy cells that carry a particular antigen. Additionally, various publications describe methods for obtaining physiologically active molecules whose half-lives are modified either by introducing an FcRn-binding polypeptide into the molecules (WO 97/43316; U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,046; U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,035; WO 96/32478; WO 91/14438) or by fusing the molecules with antibodies whose FcRn-binding affinities are preserved but affinities for other Fc receptors have been greatly reduced (WO 99/43713) or fusing with FcRn binding domains of antibodies (WO 00/09560; U.S. Pat. No. 4,703,039). Specific techniques and methods of increasing half-life of physiologically active molecules can also be found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,083,784 granted Aug. 1, 2006 entitled “Antibodies with Increased Half-lives” which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes. Specifically, it is contemplated that the scaffolds of the invention can be fused to an Fc region from an IgG, wherein said Fc region comprises amino acid residue mutations (as numbered by the EU index in Kabat): M252Y/S254T/T256E or H433K/N434F/Y436H. In addition, the scaffolds of the invention may be fused with molecules that increases or extends in vivo or serum half life. In some embodiments, the scaffolds of the invention associate with albumin, such as human serum albumin (HSA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polysaccharides, immunoglobulin molecules (IgG), complement, hemoglobin, a binding peptide, lipoproteins and other factors to increase its half-life in the bloodstream and/or its tissue penetration. Any of these fusions may be generated by standard techniques, for example, by expression of the fusion protein from a recombinant fusion gene constructed using publicly available gene sequences. Also, the scaffolds of the invention may bind or associate with molecules that increases or extends in vivo or serum half life. In some embodiments, the scaffolds of the invention associate with albumin, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polysaccharides, immunoglobulin molecules or immunoglobulin molecules having Fc mutations that increase serum half life, complement, hemoglobin, lipoproteins and other factors to increase serum half life. Any of these fusions may be generated by standard techniques, for example, by expression of the fusion protein from a recombinant fusion gene constructed using publicly available gene sequences. The term “polyethylene glycol” or “PEG” means a polyethylene glycol compound or a derivative thereof, with or without coupling agents, coupling or activating moieties (e.g., with thiol, triflate, tresylate, azirdine, oxirane, N-hydroxysuccinimide or a maleimide moiety). The term “PEG” is intended to indicate polyethylene glycol of a molecular weight between 500 and 150,000 Da, including analogues thereof, wherein for instance the terminal OH-group has been replaced by a methoxy group (referred to as mPEG). In one embodiment, the scaffolds are derivatized with polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG is a linear, water-soluble polymer of ethylene oxide repeating units with two terminal hydroxyl groups. PEGs are classified by their molecular weights which typically range from about 500 daltons to about 40,000 daltons. In a presently preferred embodiment, the PEGs employed have molecular weights ranging from 5,000 daltons to about 20,000 daltons. PEGs coupled to the scaffolds of the invention can be either branched or unbranched. (See, for example, Monfardini, C. et al. 1995 Bioconjugate Chem 6:62-69). PEGs are commercially available from Nektar Inc., Sigma Chemical Co. and other companies. Such PEGs include, but are not limited to, monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (MePEG-OH), monomethoxypolyethylene glycol-succinate (MePEG-S), monomethoxypolyethylene glycol-succinimidyl succinate (MePEG-S-NHS), monomethoxypolyethylene glycol-amine (MePEG-NH2), monomethoxypolyethylene glycol-tresylate (MePEG-TRES), and monomethoxypolyethylene glycol-imidazolyl-carbonyl (MePEG-IM). Briefly, in one embodiment, the hydrophilic polymer which is employed, for example, PEG, is capped at one end by an unreactive group such as a methoxy or ethoxy group. Thereafter, the polymer is activated at the other end by reaction with a suitable activating agent, such as cyanuric halides (for example, cyanuric chloride, bromide or fluoride), diimadozle, an anhydride reagent (for example, a dihalosuccinic anhydride, such as dibromosuccinic anhydride), acyl azide, p-diazoiumbenzyl ether, 3-(p-diazoniumphenoxy)-2-hydroxypropylether) and the like. The activated polymer is then reacted with a polypeptide as described herein to produce a polypeptide derivatized with a polymer. Alternatively, a functional group in the scaffolds of the invention can be activated for reaction with the polymer, or the two groups can be joined in a concerted coupling reaction using known coupling methods. It will be readily appreciated that the polypeptides of the invention can be derivatized with PEG using a myriad of other reaction schemes known to and used by those of skill in the art. In some embodiments, scaffolds of the invention are engineered to provide reactive groups for conjugation. In such scaffolds, the N-terminus and/or C-terminus may also serve to provide reactive groups for conjugation. In other embodiments, the N-terminus may be conjugated to one moiety (such as, but not limited to PEG) while the C-terminus is conjugated to another moiety (such as, but not limited to biotin), or vice versa. The term “in vivo half-life” is used in its normal meaning, i.e., the time at which 50% of the biological activity of the polypeptide is still present in the body/target organ, or the time at which the activity of the polypeptide is 50% of its initial value. As an alternative to determining functional in vivo half-life, “serum half-life” may be determined, i.e., the time at which 50% of the polypeptide molecules circulate in the plasma or bloodstream prior to being cleared. Determination of serum-half-life is often more simple than determining functional half-life and the magnitude of serum-half-life is usually a good indication of the magnitude of functional in vivo half-life. Alternative terms to serum half-life include plasma half-life, circulating half-life, circulatory half-life, serum clearance, plasma clearance, and clearance half-life. The functionality to be retained is normally selected from procoagulant, proteolytic, co-factor binding, receptor binding activity, or other type of biological activity associated with the particular protein. The term “increased” with respect to the functional in vivo half-life or plasma half-life is used to indicate that the relevant half-life of the polypeptide is statistically significantly increased relative to that of a reference molecule (for example an unmodified polypeptide), as determined under comparable conditions. For instance the relevant half-life may be increased by at least about 25%, such as by at least about 50%, e.g., by at least about 100%, at least about 150%, at least about 200%, at least about 250%, or at least about 500% compared to an unmodified reference molecule. In other embodiments, the half-life may be increased by about at least 1 fold, at least 2 fold, at least 3 fold, at least 4 fold, at least 5 fold, at least 10 fold, at least 20 fold, or at least 50 fold as compared to an unmodified reference molecule. 7.7 Randomization Embodiments In one aspect, the invention provides randomized scaffolds.

The present invention encompasses the use of scaffolds recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated (including both covalent and non-covalent conjugations) to a heterologous protein or polypeptide (or fragment thereof, to a polypeptide of at least 10, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90 or at least 100 amino acids) to generate fusion proteins. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences described herein. For example, scaffolds may be used to target heterologous polypeptides to particular cell types, either in vitro or in vivo, by fusing or conjugating the scaffolds to antibodies specific for particular cell surface receptors. Scaffolds fused or conjugated to heterologous polypeptides may also be used in in vitro immunoassays and purification methods using methods known in the art. See e.g., International publication No. WO 93/21232; European Patent No. EP 439,095; Naramura et al., 1994, Immunol. Lett. 39:91-99; U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,981; Gillies et al., 1992, PNAS 89:1428-1432; and Fell et al., 1991, J. Immunol. 146:2446-2452, which are incorporated by reference in their entireties. Additional fusion proteins comprising scaffolds of the invention may be generated through the techniques of gene-shuffling, motif-shuffling, exon-shuffling, and/or codon-shuffling (collectively referred to as “DNA shuffling”). DNA shuffling may be employed to alter the activities of scaffolds of the invention (e.g., scaffolds with higher affinities and lower dissociation rates). See, generally, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,793; 5,811,238; 5,830,721; 5,834,252; and 5,837,458, and Patten et al., 1997, Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 8:724-33; Harayama, 1998, Trends Biotechnol. 16(2):76-82; Hansson, et al., 1999, J. Mol. Biol. 287:265-76; and Lorenzo and Blasco, 1998, Biotechniques 24(2):308-313 (each of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Scaffolds, or the encoded scaffolds thereof, may be altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. One or more portions of a polynucleotide encoding a scaffold, which bind to a specific target may be recombined with one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc. of one or more heterologous molecules. Moreover, the scaffolds of the invention can be fused to marker sequences, such as a peptide to facilitate purification. In some embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide (his-tag), such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821-824, for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the hemagglutinin “HA” tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., 1984, Cell 37:767) and the “flag” tag. In other embodiments, scaffolds of the invention, analogs or derivatives thereof may be conjugated to a diagnostic or detectable agent. Such scaffolds can be useful for monitoring or prognosing the development or progression of a disease as part of a clinical testing procedure, such as determining the efficacy of a particular therapy. Such diagnosis and detection can be accomplished by coupling the scaffold to detectable substances including, but not limited to various enzymes, such as but not limited to horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; prosthetic groups, such as but not limited to streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; fluorescent materials, such as but not limited to, umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocynate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; luminescent materials, such as, but not limited to, luminol; bioluminescent materials, such as but not limited to, luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; radioactive materials, such as but not limited to iodine (131I, 125I, 123I, 121I) carbon (14C), sulfur (35S), tritium (3H), indium (115In, 113In, 112In, 111In,), and technetium (99Tc), thallium (201Ti), gallium (68Ga, 67Ga), palladium (103Pd), molybdenum (99Mo), xenon (133Xe), fluorine (18F), 153Sm, 177Lu, 159Gd, 149Pm, 140La, 175Yb, 166Ho, 90Y, 47Sc, 186Re, 188Re, 142Pr, 105Rh, 97Ru, 68Ge, 57Co, 65Zn, 85Sr, 32P, 153Gd, 169Yb, 51Cr, 54Mn, 75Se, 113Sn, and 117Tn; positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies, nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions, and molecules that are radiolabelled or conjugated to specific radioisotopes. The present invention further encompasses uses of scaffolds conjugated to a therapeutic moiety. A scaffold may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin, e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent, a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion, e.g., alpha-emitters. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells.

Further, a scaffold may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety or drug moiety that modifies a given biological response. Therapeutic moieties or drug moieties are not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, cholera toxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, α-interferon, β-interferon, nerve growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, tissue plasminogen activator, an apoptotic agent, e.g., TNF-α, TNF-β, AIM I (see, International publication No. WO 97/33899), AIM II (see, International Publication No. WO 97/34911), Fas Ligand (Takahashi et al., 1994, J.

Moreover, a scaffold can be conjugated to therapeutic moieties such as a radioactive metal ion, such as alpha-emitters such as 213Bi or macrocyclic chelators useful for conjugating radiometal ions, including but not limited to, 131In, 131LU, 131Y, 131Ho, 131Sm, to polypeptides. In certain embodiments, the macrocyclic chelator is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N′,N″,N′″-tetraa-cetic acid (DOTA) which can be attached to the scaffold via a linker molecule. Such linker molecules are commonly known in the art and described in Denardo et al., 1998, Clin Cancer Res. 4(10):2483-90; Peterson et al., 1999, Bioconjug. Chem. 10(4):553-7; and Zimmerman et al., 1999, Nucl. Med. Biol. 26(8):943-50, each incorporated by reference in their entireties. Techniques for conjugating therapeutic moieties to antibodies are well known, see, e.g., Arnon et al., “Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy”, in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et al. (eds.), pp. 243-56. (Alan R. Liss, Inc. 1985); Hellstrom et al., “Antibodies For Drug Delivery”, in Controlled Drug Delivery (2nd Ed.), Robinson et al. (eds.), pp. 623-53 (Marcel Dekker, Inc. 1987); Thorpe, “Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review”, in Monoclonal Antibodies 84: Biological And Clinical Applications, Pinchera et al. (eds.), pp. 475-506 (1985); “Analysis, Results, And Future Prospective Of The Therapeutic Use Of Radiolabeled Antibody In Cancer Therapy”, in Monoclonal Antibodies For Cancer Detection And Therapy, Baldwin et al. (eds.), pp. 303-16 (Academic Press 1985), and Thorpe et al., 1982, Immunol. Rev. 62:119-58. Similar approaches may be adapted for use with scaffolds of the invention. The therapeutic moiety or drug conjugated to a scaffold of the invention should be chosen to achieve the desired prophylactic or therapeutic effect(s) for a particular disorder in a subject. A clinician or other medical personnel should consider the following when deciding on which therapeutic moiety or drug to conjugate to a scaffold: the nature of the disease, the severity of the disease, and the condition of the subject. Scaffolds of the invention may also be attached to solid supports, which are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of the target antigen. Such solid supports include, but are not limited to, glass, cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene. 7.9 Production Recombinant expression of a scaffold of the invention requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the scaffold. Once a polynucleotide encoding a scaffold has been obtained, the vector for the production of scaffold may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus, methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing a scaffold encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods that are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing scaffold polypeptide coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention, thus, provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a scaffold of the invention, operably linked to a promoter. The expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce a scaffold of the invention. Thus, the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding a scaffold of the invention, operably linked to a heterologous promoter. Suitable host cells include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., E. coli and B. subtilis). A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the scaffolds of the invention. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express a scaffold of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., E. coli and B. subtilis) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing scaffold coding sequences; yeast (e.g., Saccharomyces, Pichia) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing scaffold coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing scaffold coding sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing scaffold coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, NS0, and 3T3 cells) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter). Expression vectors containing inserts of a gene encoding a scaffold of the invention can be identified by three general approaches: (a) nucleic acid hybridization, (b) presence or absence of “marker” gene functions, and (c) expression of inserted sequences. In the first approach, the presence of a gene encoding a peptide, polypeptide, protein or a fusion protein in an expression vector can be detected by nucleic acid hybridization using probes comprising sequences that are homologous to an inserted gene encoding the peptide, polypeptide, protein or the fusion protein, respectively. In the second approach, the recombinant vector/host system can be identified and selected based upon the presence or absence of certain “marker” gene functions (e.g., thymidine kinase activity, resistance to antibiotics, transformation phenotype, occlusion body formation in baculovirus, etc.) caused by the insertion of a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody or fusion protein in the vector. For example, if the nucleotide sequence encoding the scaffold is inserted within the marker gene sequence of the vector, recombinants containing the gene encoding the scaffold insert can be identified by the absence of the marker gene function. In the third approach, recombinant expression vectors can be identified by assaying the gene product (e.g., scaffold or multimer thereof) expressed by the recombinant. Such assays can be based, for example, on the physical or functional properties of the protein in in vitro assay systems, e.g., binding, agonistic or antagonistic properties of the scaffold. In some embodiments the scaffolds of the invention may be chemically synthesized at least partially. In other embodiments, the scaffolds of the invention may be produced semi-synthetically. 7.10 Scaffold Purification Once a scaffold of the invention has been produced by recombinant expression, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of a protein, for example, by chromatography (e.g., metal-chelate chromatography, ion exchange, affinity, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. The highly stable nature of the scaffolds of the invention allow for variations on purification schemes. For example, the thermal stability exhibited by the scaffolds of the invention allow for the heating of the crude lysate comprising the scaffolds to remove the bulk of the host cell proteins by denaturation. In another embodiment, the high protease resistance exhibited by the scaffolds of the invention allow for the rapid degradation of host cell proteins in crude lysates prior to any purification steps. Also, the pH tolerance exhibited by the scaffolds of the invention allow for the selective precipitation of host cell proteins in the crude lysate by lowering or raising the pH prior to any purification steps. In some embodiments, the purification of the scaffolds of the invention are facilitated by a high temperature shift, a protease treatment, a pH shift up or down, or a combination of any of the above in an effort to remove bulk host cell proteins from the crude lysate. In some embodiments, the protein remaining after the heat denaturation, protease treatment, of pH shift is at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95% specific scaffold protein. In some embodiments, methods of purifying the scaffolds comprise lowering the pH of the crude lysate containing said scaffold to about 6.5, or to about 6.0, or to about 5.5, or to about 5.0, or to about 4.5 or to about 4.0, or to about 3.5, or to about 3.0 or to about 2.5, or to about 2.0 in an effort to precipitate the host cell protein. In other embodiments, methods of purification comprise raising the pH of the crude lysate containing said scaffold to about 8.0, or to about 8.5, or to about 9.0, or to about 9.5, or to about 10.0, or to about 10.5, or to about 11.0, or to about 11.5, or to about 12.0, or to about 12.5 in an effort to precipitate the host cell protein. 7.11 Scalable Production of Scaffolds In an effort to obtain large quantities, scaffolds of the invention may be produced by a scalable process (hereinafter referred to as “scalable process of the invention”). In some embodiments, scaffolds may be produced by a scalable process of the invention in the research laboratory that may be scaled up to produce the scaffolds of the invention in analytical scale bioreactors (for example, but not limited to 5L, 10L, 15L, 30L, or 50L bioreactors).

In some embodiments, the secreted scaffold is produced at levels described herein. In other embodiments, secreted scaffolds are properly folded and fully functional. In other embodiments, the production of secreted scaffolds comprises the use of a Ptac promoter. In other embodiments, the production of secreted scaffolds comprises the use of a oppA signal. In yet other embodiments, the secreted scaffold is expressed in a prokaryotic host cell. In further embodiments, the scaffold is secreted into the periplasmic space of a prokaryotic host cell. In yet other embodiments, the scaffold is secreted directly into the media. In yet further embodiments, scaffolds may be screened from crude cell culture media or periplasm extracts. The invention also provides methods for the secretion of tandem proteins or fusions using protein scaffolds. In some embodiments, scaffolds of the invention may act as carrier molecules for the secretion of peptides and/or proteins into the cell culture media or periplasmic space of a prokaryotic cell. In another embodiment, methods of purifying scaffolds of the invention comprise heating the crude lysate comprising said scaffold to 70° C. for 15 min and subsequently removing aggregated compounds by centrifugation. In other embodiments, methods of purifying scaffolds of the invention comprise heating the crude lysate comprising said scaffold to about 50° C., about 55° C., about 60° C., about 65° C., about 70° C., about 75° C., about 80° C., about 85° C., or about 90° C. and subsequently removing aggregated compounds by centrifugation.

Representative assays which can be used, include but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), “sandwich” immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitation reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, to name but a few. Such assays are routine and known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York). ELISAs comprise preparing antigen (e.g. a scaffold), coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen, adding the epitope binding protein of interest (e.g. a scaffold specific antibody) conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the well and incubating for a period of time, and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the epitope binding protein of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the protein of interest) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the protein of interest may be coated to the well. In this case, a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 11.2.1. The binding affinity and other binding properties of a scaffold to an antigen may be determined by a variety of in vitro assay methods known in the art including for example, equilibrium methods (e.g., enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA; or radioimmunoassay (RIA)), or kinetics (e.g., BIACORE® analysis), and other methods such as indirect binding assays, competitive binding assays fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), gel electrophoresis and chromatography (e.g., gel filtration). These and other methods may utilize a label on one or more of the components being examined and/or employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic, fluorescent, luminescent, or isotopic labels. A detailed description of binding affinities and kinetics can be found in Paul, W.E., ed., Fundamental Immunology, 4th Ed., Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia (1999). The stability of scaffolds of the invention may be increased by many different approaches. In one embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention comprise a non-naturally occurring disulfide bond, as described herein. In another embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention comprise an elongation of the N and/or C terminal regions. In another embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention comprise an addition, deletion or substitution of at least one amino acid residue to adjust the surface charge of the scaffold. In another embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention comprise an alteration to increase serum half-life, as described herein. In yet another embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention comprise an addition, deletion or substitution of at least one amino acid residue to stabilize the hydrophobic core of the scaffold. The stability of scaffolds of the invention may be assessed by many different techniques. A selection of techniques know in the art include melting temperature, Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Circular Dichroism (CD), Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), protease resistance, Isothermal calorimetry (ITC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), internal fluorescence, and biological activity. In one embodiment, engineered scaffolds of the invention exhibit increased stability compared to the same scaffold prior to engineering. 7.14 Pharmaceutical Compositions In another aspect, the present invention provides a composition, for example, but not limited to, a pharmaceutical composition, containing one or a combination of scaffolds or target binding proteins of the present invention, formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may include one or a combination of, for example, but not limited to two or more different scaffolds of the invention. For example, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention may comprise a combination of scaffolds that bind to different epitopes on the target antigen or that have complementary activities. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention also can be administered in combination therapy, such as, combined with other agents. For example, the combination therapy can include a scaffold of the present invention combined with at least one other therapy wherein the therapy may be immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation treatment, or drug therapy. The pharmaceutical compounds of the invention may include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of such salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Acid addition salts include those derived from nontoxic inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphorous and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids and the like. Base addition salts include those derived from alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic amines, such as N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, procaine and the like. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention also may include a pharmaceutically acceptable anti-oxidant. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Examples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers that may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of presence of microorganisms may be ensured both by sterilization procedures and by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Pharmaceutical compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. In many cases, it will be suitable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by sterilization microfiltration. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying (lyophilization) that yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. In one embodiment the compositions (e.g., liquid formulations) of the invention are pyrogen-free formulations which are substantially free of endotoxins and/or related pyrogenic substances. Endotoxins include toxins that are confined inside a microorganism and are released when the microorganisms are broken down or die. Pyrogenic substances also include fever-inducing, thermostable substances (glycoproteins) from the outer membrane of bacteria and other microorganisms. Both of these substances can cause fever, hypotension and shock if administered to humans. Due to the potential harmful effects, it is advantageous to remove even low amounts of endotoxins from intravenously administered pharmaceutical drug solutions. The Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) has set an upper limit of 5 endotoxin units (EU) per dose per kilogram body weight in a single one hour period for intravenous drug applications (The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Pharmacopeial Forum 26 (1):223 (2000)). When therapeutic proteins are administered in amounts of several hundred or thousand milligrams per kilogram body weight it is advantageous to remove even trace amounts of endotoxin. In one embodiment, endotoxin and pyrogen levels in the composition are less then 10 EU/mg, or less then 5 EU/mg, or less then 1 EU/mg, or less then 0.1 EU/mg, or less then 0.01 EU/mg, or less then 0.001 EU/mg. In another embodiment, endotoxin and pyrogen levels in the composition are less then about 10 EU/mg, or less then about 5 EU/mg, or less then about 1 EU/mg, or less then about 0.1 EU/mg, or less then about 0.01 EU/mg, or less then about 0.001 EU/mg. 7.15 Dosing/Administration To prepare pharmaceutical or sterile compositions including a scaffold of the invention, scaffold is mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Formulations of therapeutic and diagnostic agents can be prepared by mixing with physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers in the form of, e.g., lyophilized powders, slurries, aqueous solutions, lotions, or suspensions (see, e.g., Hardman, et al. (2001) Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y.; Gennaro (2000) Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, New York, N.Y.; Avis, et al. (eds.) (1993) Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Parenteral Medications, Marcel Dekker, NY; Lieberman, et al. (eds.) (1990) Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Marcel Dekker, NY; Lieberman, et al. (eds.) (1990) Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems, Marcel Dekker, NY; Weiner and Kotkoskie (2000) Excipient Toxicity and Safety, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y.). Selecting an administration regimen for a therapeutic depends on several factors, including the serum or tissue turnover rate of the entity, the level of symptoms, the immunogenicity of the entity, and the accessibility of the target cells in the biological matrix. In certain embodiments, an administration regimen maximizes the amount of therapeutic delivered to the patient consistent with an acceptable level of side effects. Accordingly, the amount of biologic delivered depends in part on the particular entity and the severity of the condition being treated. Guidance in selecting appropriate doses of antibodies, cytokines, and small molecules are available (see, e.g., Wawrzynczak (1996) Antibody Therapy, Bios Scientific Pub. Ltd, Oxfordshire, UK; Kresina (ed.) (1991) Monoclonal Antibodies, Cytokines and Arthritis, Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y.; Bach (ed.) (1993) Monoclonal Antibodies and Peptide Therapy in Autoimmune Diseases, Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y.; Baert, et al. (2003) New Engl. J. Med. 348:601-608; Milgrom, et al. (1999) New Engl. J. Med. 341:1966-1973; Slamon, et al. (2001) New Engl. J. Med. 344:783-792; Beniaminovitz, et al. (2000) New Engl. J. Med. 342:613-619; Ghosh, et al. (2003) New Engl. J. Med. 348:24-32; Lipsky, et al. (2000) New Engl. J. Med. 343:1594-1602). Determination of the appropriate dose is made by the clinician, e.g., using parameters or factors known or suspected in the art to affect treatment or predicted to affect treatment. Generally, the dose begins with an amount somewhat less than the optimum dose and it is increased by small increments thereafter until the desired or optimum effect is achieved relative to any negative side effects. Important diagnostic measures include those of symptoms of, e.g., the inflammation or level of inflammatory cytokines produced. Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts. Scaffolds of the invention can be provided by continuous infusion, or by doses at intervals of, e.g., one day, one week, or 1-7 times per week. Doses may be provided intravenously, subcutaneously, topically, orally, nasally, rectally, intramuscular, intracerebrally, or by inhalation. A specific dose protocol is one involving the maximal dose or dose frequency that avoids significant undesirable side effects. A total weekly dose may be at least 0.05 μg/kg body weight, at least 0.2 μg/kg, at least 0.5 μg/kg, at least 1 μg/kg, at least 10 μg/kg, at least 100 μg/kg, at least 0.2 mg/kg, at least 1.0 mg/kg, at least 2.0 mg/kg, at least 10 mg/kg, at least 25 mg/kg, or at least 50 mg/kg (see, e.g., Yang, et al. (2003) New Engl. J. Med. 349:427-434; Herold, et al. (2002) New Engl. J. Med. 346:1692-1698; Liu, et al. (1999) J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psych. 67:451-456; Portielji, et al. (20003) Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 52:133-144). The desired dose of a small molecule therapeutic, e.g., a peptide mimetic, protein scaffold, natural product, or organic chemical, is about the same as for an antibody or polypeptide, on a moles/kg body weight basis. The desired plasma concentration of a small molecule or scaffold therapeutic is about the same as for an antibody, on a moles/kg body weight basis. The dose may be at least 15 μg, at least 20 μg, at least 25 μg, at least 30 μg, at least 35 μg, at least 40 μg, at least 45 μg, at least 50 μg, at least 55 μg, at least 60 μg, at least 65 μg, at least 70 μg, at least 75 μg, at least 80 μg, at least 85 μg, at least 90 μg, at least 95 μg, or at least 100 μg. The doses administered to a subject may number at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12, or more. For scaffolds of the invention, the dosage administered to a patient may be 0.0001 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. The dosage may be between 0.0001 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, 0.0001 and 2 mg/kg, 0.0001 and 1 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg and 0.75 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg to 0.25 mg/kg, 0.0001 to 0.15 mg/kg, 0.0001 to 0.10 mg/kg, 0.001 to 0.5 mg/kg, 0.01 to 0.25 mg/kg or 0.01 to 0.10 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. The dosage of the scaffolds of the invention may be calculated using the patient's weight in kilograms (kg) multiplied by the dose to be administered in mg/kg. The dosage of the scaffolds of the invention may be 150 μg/kg or less, 125 μg/kg or less, 100 μg/kg or less, 95 μg/kg or less, 90 μg/kg or less, 85 μg/kg or less, 80 μg/kg or less, 75 μg/kg or less, 70 μg/kg or less, 65 μg/kg or less, 60 μg/kg or less, 55 μg/kg or less, 50 μg/kg or less, 45 μg/kg or less, 40 μg/kg or less, 35 μg/kg or less, 30 μg/kg or less, 25 μg/kg or less, 20 μg/kg or less, 15 μg/kg or less, 10 μg/kg or less, 5 μg/kg or less, 2.5 μg/kg or less, 2 μg/kg or less, 1.5 μg/kg or less, 1 μg/kg or less, 0.5 μg/kg or less, or 0.5 μg/kg or less of a patient's body weight. Unit dose of the scaffolds of the invention may be 0.1 mg to 20 mg, 0.1 mg to 15 mg, 0.1 mg to 12 mg, 0.1 mg to 10 mg, 0.1 mg to 8 mg, 0.1 mg to 7 mg, 0.1 mg to 5 mg, 0.1 to 2.5 mg, 0.25 mg to 20 mg, 0.25 to 15 mg, 0.25 to 12 mg, 0.25 to 10 mg, 0.25 to 8 mg, 0.25 mg to 7 m g, 0.25 mg to 5 mg, 0.5 mg to 2.5 mg, 1 mg to 20 mg, 1 mg to 15 mg, 1 mg to 12 mg, 1 mg to 10 mg, 1 mg to 8 mg, 1 mg to 7 mg, 1 mg to 5 mg, or 1 mg to 2.5 mg. The dosage of the scaffolds of the invention may achieve a serum titer of at least 0.1 μg/ml, at least 0.5 μg/ml, at least 1 μg/ml, at least 2 μg/ml, at least 5 μg/ml, at least 6 μg/ml, at least 10 μg/ml, at least 15 μg/ml, at least 20 μg/ml, at least 25 μg/ml, at least 50 μg/ml, at least 100 μg/ml, at least 125 μg/ml, at least 150 μg/ml, at least 175 μg/ml, at least 200 μg/ml, at least 225 μg/ml, at least 250 μg/ml, at least 275 μg/ml, at least 300 μg/ml, at least 325 μg/ml, at least 350 μg/ml, at least 375 μg/ml, or at least 400 μg/ml in a subject. Alternatively, the dosage of the scaffolds of the invention may achieve a serum titer of at least 0.1 μg/ml, at least 0.5 μg/ml, at least 1 μg/ml, at least, 2 μg/ml, at least 5 μg/ml, at least 6 μg/ml, at least 10 μg/ml, at least 15 μg/ml, at least 20 μg/ml, at least 25 μg/ml, at least 50 μg/ml, at least 100 μg/ml, at least 125 μg/ml, at least 150 μg/ml, at least 175 μg/ml, at least 200 μg/ml, at least 225 μg/ml, at least 250 μg/ml, at least 275 μg/ml, at least 300 μg/ml, at least 325 μg/ml, at least 350 μg/ml, at least 375 μg/ml, or at least 400 μg/ml in the subject. Doses of scaffolds of the invention may be repeated and the administrations may be separated by at least 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, 30 days, 45 days, 2 months, 75 days, 3 months, or at least 6 months. An effective amount for a particular patient may vary depending on factors such as the condition being treated, the overall health of the patient, the method route and dose of administration and the severity of side affects (see, e.g., Maynard, et al. (1996) A Handbook of SOPs for Good Clinical Practice, Interpharm Press, Boca Raton, Fla.; Dent (2001) Good Laboratory and Good Clinical Practice, Urch Publ., London, UK). The route of administration may be by, e.g., topical or cutaneous application, injection or infusion by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial, intracerebrospinal, intralesional, or by sustained release systems or an implant (see, e.g., Sidman et al. (1983) Biopolymers 22:547-556; Langer, et al. (1981) J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 15:167-277; Langer (1982) Chem. Tech. 12:98-105; Epstein, et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:3688-3692; Hwang, et al. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4030-4034; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,350,466 and 6,316,024). Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lidocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. In addition, pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,019,968, 5,985, 320, 5,985,309, 5,934,272, 5,874,064, 5,855,913, 5,290,540, and 4,880,078; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 92/19244, WO 97/32572, WO 97/44013, WO 98/31346, and WO 99/66903, each of which is incorporated herein by reference their entirety. In one embodiment, an antibody, combination therapy, or a composition of the invention is administered using Alkermes AIR™ pulmonary drug delivery technology (Alkermes, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.). A composition of the present invention may also be administered via one or more routes of administration using one or more of a variety of methods known in the art. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. Selected routes of administration for scaffolds of the invention include intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, spinal or other parenteral routes of administration, for example by injection or infusion. Parenteral administration may represent modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal injection and infusion. Alternatively, a composition of the invention can be administered via a non-parenteral route, such as a topical, epidermal or mucosal route of administration, for example, intranasally, orally, vaginally, rectally, sublingually or topically. If the scaffolds of the invention are administered in a controlled release or sustained release system, a pump may be used to achieve controlled or sustained release (see Langer, supra; Sefton, 1987, CRC Crit. Ref Biomed. Eng. 14:20; Buchwald et al., 1980, Surgery 88:507; Saudek et al., 1989, N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574). Polymeric materials can be used to achieve controlled or sustained release of the therapies of the invention (see e.g., Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, 1983, J., Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61; see also Levy et al., 1985, Science 228:190; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al., 1989, J. Neurosurg. 71:105); U.S. Pat. No. 5,679,377; U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,597; U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,015; U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,463; U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,326; PCT Publication No. WO 99/15154; and PCT Publication No. WO 99/20253. Examples of polymers used in sustained release formulations include, but are not limited to, poly(2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic acid), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), poly(methacrylic acid), polyglycolides (PLG), polyanhydrides, poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol), polylactides (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolides) (PLGA), and polyorthoesters. In one embodiment, the polymer used in a sustained release formulation is inert, free of leachable impurities, stable on storage, sterile, and biodegradable. A controlled or sustained release system can be placed in proximity of the prophylactic or therapeutic target, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). Controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (1990, Science 249:1527-1533). Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more scaffolds of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938, PCT publication WO 91/05548, PCT publication WO 96/20698, Ning et al., 1996, “Intratumoral Radioimmunotheraphy of a Human Colon Cancer Xenograft Using a Sustained-Release Gel,” Radiotherapy & Oncology 39:179-189, Song et al., 1995, “Antibody Mediated Lung Targeting of Long-Circulating Emulsions,” PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science & Technology 50:372-397, Cleek et al., 1997, “Biodegradable Polymeric Carriers for a bFGF Antibody for Cardiovascular Application,” Pro. Intl. Symp. Control. Rel. Bioact. Mater. 24:853-854, and Lam et al., 1997, “Microencapsulation of Recombinant Humanized Monoclonal Antibody for Local Delivery,” Proc. Intl. Symp. Control Rel. Bioact. Mater. 24:759-760, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. If the scaffold of the invention is administered topically, it can be formulated in the form of an ointment, cream, transdermal patch, lotion, gel, shampoo, spray, aerosol, solution, emulsion, or other form well-known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 19th ed., Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa. (1995). For non-sprayable topical dosage forms, viscous to semi-solid or solid forms comprising a carrier or one or more excipients compatible with topical application and having a dynamic viscosity, in some instances, greater than water are typically employed. Suitable formulations include, without limitation, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, creams, ointments, powders, liniments, salves, and the like, which are, if desired, sterilized or mixed with auxiliary agents (e.g., preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, buffers, or salts) for influencing various properties, such as, for example, osmotic pressure. Other suitable topical dosage forms include sprayable aerosol preparations wherein the active ingredient, in some instances, in combination with a solid or liquid inert carrier, is packaged in a mixture with a pressurized volatile (e.g., a gaseous propellant, such as freon) or in a squeeze bottle. Moisturizers or humectants can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms if desired. Examples of such additional ingredients are well-known in the art. If the scaffolds of the invention are administered intranasally, it can be formulated in an aerosol form, spray, mist or in the form of drops. In particular, prophylactic or therapeutic agents for use according to the present invention can be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant (e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas). In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges (composed of, e.g., gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. Methods for co-administration or treatment with a second therapeutic agent, e.g., a cytokine, steroid, chemotherapeutic agent, antibiotic, or radiation, are well known in the art (see, e.g., Hardman, et al. (eds.) (2001) Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 10.sup.th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y.; Poole and Peterson (eds.) (2001) Pharmacotherapeutics for Advanced Practice: A Practical Approach, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Phila., Pa.; Chabner and Longo (eds.) (2001) Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Phila., Pa.). An effective amount of therapeutic may decrease the symptoms by at least 10%; by at least 20%; at least about 30%; at least 40%, or at least 50%. Additional therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents), which can be administered in combination with the scaffolds of the invention may be administered less than 5 minutes apart, less than 30 minutes apart, 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour apart, at about 1 to about 2 hours apart, at about 2 hours to about 3 hours apart, at about 3 hours to about 4 hours apart, at about 4 hours to about 5 hours apart, at about 5 hours to about 6 hours apart, at about 6 hours to about 7 hours apart, at about 7 hours to about 8 hours apart, at about 8 hours to about 9 hours apart, at about 9 hours to about 10 hours apart, at about 10 hours to about 11 hours apart, at about 11 hours to about 12 hours apart, at about 12 hours to 18 hours apart, 18 hours to 24 hours apart, 24 hours to 36 hours apart, 36 hours to 48 hours apart, 48 hours to 52 hours apart, 52 hours to 60 hours apart, 60 hours to 72 hours apart, 72 hours to 84 hours apart, 84 hours to 96 hours apart, or 96 hours to 120 hours apart from the scaffolds of the invention. The two or more therapies may be administered within one same patient visit. The scaffolds of the invention and the other therapies may be cyclically administered. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first therapy (e.g., a first prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time, followed by the administration of a second therapy (e.g., a second prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time, optionally, followed by the administration of a third therapy (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time and so forth, and repeating this sequential administration, i.e., the cycle in order to reduce the development of resistance to one of the therapies, to avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies, and/or to improve the efficacy of the therapies. In certain embodiments, the scaffolds of the invention can be formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that the therapeutic compounds of the invention cross the BBB (if desired), they can be formulated, for example, in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,811; 5,374,548; and 5,399,331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties which are selectively transported into specific cells or organs, thus enhance targeted drug delivery (see, e.g., V. V. Ranade (1989) J. Clin. Pharmacol. 29:685). Exemplary targeting moieties include folate or biotin (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,016 to Low et al.); mannosides (Umezawa et al., (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 153:1038); antibodies (P. G. Bloeman et al. (1995) FEBS Lett. 357:140; M. Owais et al. (1995) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39:180); surfactant protein A receptor (Briscoe et al. (1995) Am. J. Physiol. 1233:134); p120 (Schreier et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269:9090); see also K. Keinanen; M. L. Laukkanen (1994) FEBS Lett. 346:123; J. J. Killion; I. J. Fidler (1994) Immunomethods 4:273. The invention provides protocols for the administration of pharmaceutical composition comprising scaffolds of the invention alone or in combination with other therapies to a subject in need thereof. The therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents) of the combination therapies of the present invention can be administered concomitantly or sequentially to a subject. The therapy (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents) of the combination therapies of the present invention can also be cyclically administered. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first therapy (e.g., a first prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time, followed by the administration of a second therapy (e.g., a second prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration, i.e., the cycle, in order to reduce the development of resistance to one of the therapies (e.g., agents) to avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies (e.g., agents), and/or to improve, the efficacy of the therapies. The therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents) of the combination therapies of the invention can be administered to a subject concurrently. The term “concurrently” is not limited to the administration of therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents) at exactly the same time, but rather it is meant that a pharmaceutical composition comprising scaffolds of the invention are administered to a subject in a sequence and within a time interval such that the scaffolds of the invention can act together with the other therapy(ies) to provide an increased benefit than if they were administered otherwise. For example, each therapy may be administered to a subject at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time; however, if not administered at the same time, they should be administered sufficiently close in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Each therapy can be administered to a subject separately, in any appropriate form and by any suitable route. In various embodiments, the therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents) are administered to a subject less than 15 minutes, less than 30 minutes, less than 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour to about 2 hours apart, at about 2 hours to about 3 hours apart, at about 3 hours to about 4 hours apart, at about 4 hours to about 5 hours apart, at about 5 hours to about 6 hours apart, at about 6 hours to about 7 hours apart, at about 7 hours to about 8 hours apart, at about 8 hours to about 9 hours apart, at about 9 hours to about 10 hours apart, at about 10 hours to about 11 hours apart, at about 11 hours to about 12 hours apart, 24 hours apart, 48 hours apart, 72 hours apart, or 1 week apart. In other embodiments, two or more therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents) are administered to a within the same patient visit. The prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the combination therapies can be administered to a subject in the same pharmaceutical composition. Alternatively, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the combination therapies can be administered concurrently to a subject in separate pharmaceutical compositions. The prophylactic or therapeutic agents may be administered to a subject by the same or different routes of administration. 7.16 Methods of Using Scaffolds The scaffolds of the present invention have in vitro and in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic utilities. For example, these molecules can be administered to cells in culture, e.g. in vitro or ex vivo, or in a subject, e.g., in vivo, to treat, prevent or diagnose a variety of disorders.

In some instances, it may also be known as TNFRSF10B; CD262, DR5, KILLER<KILLER/DR5, TRAILR2, TRICK2, TRICK2A, TRICK2B, TRICKB, or ZTNFR9. This receptor can be activated by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TNFSF10/TRAIL/APO-2L), and transduces an apoptotic signal. Further, TRAIL-R2 induced apoptosis involves caspases and the intracellular adapter molecule FADD/MORT1 (Walczak et al. EMBOJ, (1997), 16, 5386-97). In some embodiments, the invention also provides scaffolds that specifically bind to TRAIL-R2. In specific embodiments, scaffolds of the invention specifically bind to human TRAIL-R2.

In further embodiments, dimerization of TRAIL-R2 may be achieved through the use of, for example, but not limited to, multimeric scaffolds, scaffolds that mimic TRAIL-R2 dimers, scaffolds that stabilize TRAIL-R2 dimer formation, scaffolds that destabilize TRAIL-R2 monomers or scaffolds that only recognize TRAIL-R2 dimers displayed on cells. In other embodiments, dimerization or oligomerization of TRAIL-R2 may be achieved through the use of monomeric scaffolds coupled with a scaffold dimerization or oligomerization agent.

In some embodiments, cell viability is measured using the procedure outlined in Example 15 and/or 17 herein or other known methods in the art. In some embodiments, TRAIL-R2 binding scaffolds of the invention agonize TRAIL-R2 with similar activity as the ligand for TRAIL-R2, known as TRAIL (Apo-2 ligand).

Although several types of normal cells express TRAIL-R2, apoptosis signaling through this receptor appears to be restricted primarily to tumor cells, which become more susceptible to death receptor-mediated apoptosis in the context of their transformation by oncogenes such as Myc or Ras (Wang et al., Cancer Cell 5:501-12 (2004); Nesterov et al., Cancer Res. 64:3922-7 (2004)). TRAIL-R2 is frequently expressed by human cancer cell lines as well as primary tumors. The TRAIL-R2 specific scaffolds of the invention may be useful in the prevention, treatment, maintenance or amelioration of cancer. In some embodiments, cancer may involve cancer cells that express TRAIL-R2. In other embodiments, cancer cells overexpress TRAIL-R2 as compared to non-cancerous cells. In some embodiments, the cancer is, for example, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, or leukemia. In other embodiments, cancer may include squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, blastoma, gastrointestinal cancer, renal cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, endometrial carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, or other cancers described herein. In some embodiments, TRAIL-R2 specific scaffolds of the invention are administered to a subject in need of treatment (i.e. a patient with cancer). In such embodiments, a sterile, pyrogen-free composition comprising a TRAIL-R2 specific scaffold is administered to a subject in need thereof. The efficiency of treatment may be measured using a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays well known in the art, such as, but not limited to apoptotic activity, using caspase activation of Annexin V binding, as well as a reduction in tumor burden or volume. In other embodiments, TRAIL-R2 specific scaffolds of the invention are useful for the diagnosis and detection of cancer or other TRAIL-R2 associated diseases. In such embodiments, TRAIL-R2 specific scaffolds of the invention are linked to a detection agent, such as, but not limited to a radioisotope, fluorescent or chemiluminescent label. Such linked binders are useful in methods that detect or diagnose cancer or TRAIL-R2 associated diseases in a subject, or a sample taken from said subject. In addition, TRAIL-R2 specific scaffolds are useful in the diagnosis and treatment of other TRAIL-R2 associated pathological conditions, such as immune-related diseases in mammals, including humans. 7.17.2 Specific TRAIL-R2 Binding Sequences In an effort to identify TRAIL-R2 specific scaffolds, a two-loop library and a three loop library were screened.

EXAMPLES The invention is now described with reference to the following examples. These examples are provided for the purpose of illustration only and the invention should in no way be construed as being limited to these examples but rather should be construed to encompass any and all variations which become evident as a result of the teachings provided herein. 9.1 Example 1 Recombinant Expression of Candidate Scaffolds This example demonstrates that candidate scaffolds may be recombinantly expressed in E. coli in sufficient quantity to be visible against the background of host proteins on a Coomassie stained on a polyacrylamide gel (FIG. 1). Represented in FIG. 1 is the PAGE analysis of crude E. coli lysates expressing candidate scaffolds. Some of the candidate scaffolds exhibited higher expression levels (exemplified by lanes 3, 4, 5, and 10) and were selected for further development. Specifically, Lane 3 represents the 6th domain of Fibronectin III, Lane 4 represents the scaffold from β-common receptor, Lane 5 represents the candidate scaffold from growth hormone receptor and Lane 10 represents the Tn3 structural motif. Recombinant Expression A panel of human-derived Tn3 structural motif sequences were selected for heterologous expression in E. coli (Table 1). Synthetic cDNAs encoding each of these proteins, and optimized for codon usage in E. coli, were supplied by GenScript Corporation as per the sequences shown. Each cDNA contained flanking Nco I and Kpn I restriction sites, and following digestion with these enzymes, the inserts were cloned into a modified pET22b vector (Novagen) containing corresponding Nco I/Kpn I sites. In other embodiments, vectors may comprise any number of restrictions sites to facilitate the engineering of the scaffolds of the invention. In some embodiments, vectors of the invention comprise at least one restriction site. In other embodiments, vectors of the invention comprise at least one restriction site flanking at least one loop sequence. In other embodiments, vectors of the invention comprise at least one restriction site selected from the group consisting of NcoI, BglII, BstEII, AscI, and KpnI. In further embodiments, the vector comprises a leader sequence. In other embodiments, the vector comprises a linker sequence. In a specific embodiment, vectors of the invention comprise the polynucleotide sequence defined by SEQ ID NO:99. Transformants of BL21 DE3 E. coli harboring Tn3 structural motif expression plasmids were grown overnight at 37° C. in Luria Broth containing 50 μg/mL carbenicillum. Overnight cultures were diluted 1 in 20 into Super Broth media containing 50 μg/mL carbenicillum and 2% w/v glucose and incubated at 37° C. with shaking until the optical density at 600 nm was 0.6. At this time, protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG to 200 μM, and cultures were transferred to a 30° C. incubator with shaking After 5 h at 30° C., a small aliquot of culture was removed for SDS-PAGE analysis, and the remainder of cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and frozen overnight at −20° C. SDS-PAGE analysis of whole cell lysates suggested that Tn3 structural motifs 3, 4, 5, 10 were highly overexpressed in E. coli as determined by gel bands at approximately 10 kDa (FIG. 1). In a separate experiment, it was also determined that Tn3 structural motif 12 was overexpressed. Purification Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) containing 1 mg/mL lysozyme (Sigma) and 200 units/mL of DNase (Invitrogen). Lysis was effected by sonication, and clarified lysate was separated from cell debris by centrifugation followed by filtration through a 0.8 μm filter. Lysates were loaded onto HiTrap chelating columns charged with Ni2+, washed with 15 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and eluted with 4 column volumes of elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). The concentrations of purified protein were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm according to Gill and von Hippel (Anal. Biochem. 182: 319, 1989). Post purification yields of the various Tn3 proteins are reported in Table 1. The Tn3 structural motif derived from human tenascin C (Tn3) gave the highest yield, which corresponded to 110 mg of purified Tn3 obtained from a 400 mL culture. SDS-PAGE analysis of a purified Tn3 sample is shown in FIG. 2.

Stability Thermal unfolding of Tn3 was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A 1 mg/mL Tn3 sample in 20 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.0 exhibited a melting temperature (Tm) of 45° C. (FIG. 3A), moreover, thermal unfolding was reversible as evidenced by superimposable thermograms when the same sample was cooled and reheated. Tn3 was more stable to thermal unfolding at lower pH or high salt. The Tm in 20 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 was 56° C., and 55° C. in 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 containing 1 M NaCl. Unfolding of Tn3 by chaotropic agents was monitored by intrinsic fluorescence. Samples of 0.1 mg/mL Tn3 containing different concentrations of urea or guanidine hydrochloride were prepared in 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, or 20 mM Tris pH 7.5. Fluorescence emission spectra were acquired on a Photon Technology QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. In the absence of chaotrope, folded samples of Tn3 exhibited an emission maxima at 319 nm. Unfolding of Tn3 by urea or GuHCl resulted in a red shift of the maxima to 348 nm, in addition to an increase in fluorescence intensity. The midpoint of unfolding at pH 7.0 or 7.5 occurred at approximately 2M urea (FIG. 3B) or 0.8M GuHCl. The stability of Tn3 to proteolytic degradation was tested by incubation with thermolysin. Tn3 (45 μM) in digest buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 10 mM CaCl2) was incubated at room temperature with thermolysin (0.45 μM). Aliquots of the digest were removed at different time points, and the reaction quenched by addition of excess EDTA. Samples were then analysed by SDS-PAGE (see the WT lanes in FIG. 10I). As demonstrated by FIG. 10I, the wild-type Tn3 domain is rapidly degraded when incubated with thermolysin. Size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) was used to determine whether Tn3 was monomeric in solution. Size exclusion separation was carried out using a Bio-Rad Bio-Sil SEC 125-5 column (7.8×300 mm) at a flow rate of 0.75 mL/min. The mobile phase was phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH7.2. Triple detection was accomplished using a Wyatt Technologies DAWN EOS multi-angle light scattering detector coupled with a Wyatt Technologies Optilab rEX differential refractive index detector and an Agilent 1100 Series variable wavelength UV detector. SEC-MALS analysis showed that the monomer content of a 4.5 mg/mL Tn3 stored at 4° C. for 2 months was 97% (FIG. 3C). The experimentally-derived monomer mass was 10.6 kDa which is in close agreement with the calculated mass of 10.8 kDa. The Tn3 scaffold remains as a monomer as a monomer even through extended periods of storage. 9.2 Example 2 Identification of Loop Length and Sequence Diversity An ideal scaffold is highly soluble and stable. It should be small enough for structural analysis, yet large enough to accommodate a multitude of changes to facilitate binding of a target. In an effort to facilitate the identification and engineering of non-antibody protein scaffolds as well as design of combinatorial libraries of scaffolds, a bioinformatics analysis of scaffold sequences was performed. The Tn3 structural motif is small, monomeric, soluble and stable. In addition, Tn3 structural motifs are present in many different human proteins, providing important information on conserved residues which are often important for the stability and folding as well as regions of diversity which can be exploited to introduce novel binding functions. From sequence analysis, large variations are seen in the BC and FG loops, suggesting that the loops are not crucial to stability. Using this property, a strategy was developed to identify candidate protein scaffolds and analyze the loop length and sequence diversity in an effort to characterize the natural extent of variation that occurs in these two parameters. A search of the available protein databases identified a number of protein scaffolds based on the Tn3 structural motif. Candidate scaffolds contained a similar predicted structure to Tn3 structural motifs, namely 7 beta strands each separated by a loop region. An analysis of the location of the beta strands and the loop regions revealed a pattern of diversity that may aide in the prediction of loop length and sequence compositions for candidate scaffolds for which a structure is not available. A length diversity analysis was performed for the BC, DE, and FG loops of candidate scaffolds in accessible protein databases. A compilation of identified scaffold sequences has lead to the development of the loop length diversity graphs presented in FIGS. 4, 5, and 6. Presented in FIG. 4A is the BC loop length diversity obtained from the analysis of 51 sequences from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It is apparent from the graph that the BC loop length in this collection of sequences ranges from about 8 amino acid residues to about 26 amino acid residues, with the 9 amino acid residue loop being the most predominant. Presented in FIG. 4B is loop length diversity obtained from the analysis of 397 sequences identified from the Swiss-prot database. It is apparent from the graph that the BC loop length in this collection of sequences ranges from about 7 amino acid residues to about 19 amino acid residues, with the 12 amino acid residue loop being the most predominant. Presented in FIG. 5 is the FG loop length diversity obtained from the analysis of 51 sequences identified from the PDB database. It is apparent from the graph that the FG loop length in this collection of sequences ranges from about 6 amino acid residues to about 18 amino acid residues, with the 10 amino acid residue loop being the most predominant. A similar analysis as described herein was performed for the DE loop sequences. Presented in FIG. 6 is the DE loop length diversity, demonstrating that the length of DE loops range from about 4 amino acid residues to about 17 amino acid residues with the 6 residue loop being the most predominant length. In addition to the length diversity, for the more abundant loop lengths a sequence diversity analysis was performed in an attempt to guide the establishment of consensus sequences. Presented in FIG. 7A is the sequence diversity graph of 9 amino acid residue BC loops. The prevalence of a particular amino acid at each position is represented by the relative size of the box containing that residue over each position. For example, at position 3 of a 9 amino acid residue loop, there is a preference of a proline or an alanine Also, at position 5 there is a preference for glycine and alanine. At position 7 there is a preference for the amino acids valine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine Other positions in the loop show greater sequence diversity suggesting that these positions may be suitable for complete randomization in construction of libraries of the Tn3 scaffold. Presented in FIG. 7B is the sequence diversity graph of 12 amino acid residue BC loops. In this analysis, for example, at position 3 a Proline residue is preferred. Also, positions 1, 4, 5 and 12 appear to be suitable for complete randomization as they do not exhibit selectivity for an amino acid residue. Presented in FIG. 8 is the sequence diversity graph for all lengths of FG loops. From this analysis, position 2 is often asparagine, position 5 prefers glycine, position 7 is often glycine or serine. Also, positions 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13 represent candidate positions for complete randomization in library construction as they do not demonstrate selectivity for amino acid residues. The data from this analysis suggests a potential benefit of limiting loop diversity at positions showing a sequence conservation such that a greater proportion of molecules in a library may maintain WT-like stability, expression and solubility. 9.3 Example 3 Construction of a Phage Displayed Tn3 Library and Selection of Specific Binders Given the loop and sequence diversity established above, a directed approach to the development of libraries was performed. More specifically, loops BC and FG were randomized in a restricted fashion. The following strategy was employed for the BC and FG loops. Library Design and Construction A synthetic cDNA encoding Tn3, corresponding to the Nco I-Kpn I fragment of seq. ID 10D (See Section 7 for sequence), was cloned into a phage display vector enabling display of Tn3 protein on the surface of M13 bacteriophage as a fusion to a fragment of the gene III coat protein. The construct encoded a 20 amino acid Thr/Pro-rich linker sequence between the C-terminus of Tn3 and codons 251-406 of M13 gene III. Libraries of randomly mutated Tn3 were prepared by Kunkel mutagenesis (Kunkel T A et al., Methods Enzym. 204, 125, 1991) using degenerate oligonucleotides. Three degenerate oligonucleotides were used to randomize the coding sequence of the BC loop, and three for the FG loop (Table 2.). This strategy resulted in the introduction of characterized sequence and loop length diversity into the Tn3 library, consistent with patterns of diversity described for natural Tn3 domains.

Phage was then isolated from culture supernatants by precipitation with a saline polyethylene glycol solution and resuspended in a small volume of PBS. Panning of Libraries for a Specific SYNAGIS® Binding Scaffold SYNAGIS® was passively adsorbed onto microtitre plate wells, and free sites were blocked with PBS containing 10 mg/mL BSA or casein. Phage stocks were diluted with PBS containing 2 mg/mL BSA or casein and 0.1% v/v Tween-20. Diluted phage samples (100 μL; ˜1012 phage) were added to SYNAGIS®-coated wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking Plates were then washed 10-15 times with PBS containing 0.1% v/v Tween 20, and bound phage were eluted with 100 μL/well of 0.1M HCl, then neutralized by addition of 1.0M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Eluted phage were re-propagated by infection of XL-1 Blue E. coli and harvested from overnight cultures co-infected with M13KO7 helper phage in 50 mL 2YT medium containing 50 μg/mL carbenicillum. The library was panned against SYNAGIS® in this manner for a total of four rounds, using BSA in the blocking and diluent buffers in the first and third rounds, and casein in rounds 2 and 4. Screening of SYNAGIS® Binding Clones After the final round of panning, eluted phage were serially diluted and used to infect XL-1 Blue E. coli for 1 h prior to plating overnight on LB agar containing 50 μg/mL carbenicillum. Individual colonies were picked and grown overnight in 2YT/carbenicillum at 37° C. Cultures were then diluted 1:100 in 2YT/carbenicillum, grown to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.4, and M13KO7 helper phage were added followed by overnight incubation at 37° C. with shaking Following centrifugation, 50 μL of culture supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of PBS containing 0.1% v/v Tween 20 and 2% w/v skim milk powder, and used for analysis by ELISA. Clones that gave the highest response for binding to SYNAGIS® but not BSA/casein-coated ELISA plates were then selected for sequencing. To determine the sequences of Tn3 variants displayed by the selected clones, 1 μL of culture supernatant was used in a PCR to amplify a fragment encompassing the encoded Tn3 sequence. This PCR product was then treated with ExoSAPit, (USB Corp., Cleveland, Ohio) to degrade unconsumed deoxynucleotides and primers, and sequenced directly. Identification of the SYNAGIS®-Binding Tn3 Variant SynBP01 DNA sequencing of SYNAGIS®-binding Tn3 variants identified 3 unique clones. The clone with the highest signal in a SYNAGIS®-binding ELISA, SynBP01, contained novel BC and FG loop sequences as shown in Table 3. To express soluble SynBP01, the NcoI-KpnI cDNA fragment was excised from the phage display vector and cloned into the corresponding sites of the E. coli expression vector previously described. Recombinant SynBP01 was then expressed in E. coli, and purified as previously described for wild type Tn3. The yield of purified SynBP01 was 18 mg from 400 mL of E. coli culture, and was greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (FIG. 9A.). As this recovery is close to the capacity of the 1 mL nickel chelate affinity column used, it is likely that this yield under represents the actual expression level of SynBP01. Determination of SYNAGIS® Binding Affinity Exhibited by SynBP01 The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for binding of SynBP01 to SYNAGIS® was measured by surface plasmon resonance on a BIAcore 3000 instrument. SYNAGIS® was covalently immobilized on the biosensor chip via primary amino groups. Equilibrium binding of SynBP01 was measured by injecting samples of SynBP01 in HBS-EP buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, 0.005% v/v Tween 20) over the chip at a flow rate of 10 μL/min (FIG. 9B). Following each equilibrium binding measurement, SynBP01 was allowed to completely dissociate by running HBS-EP buffer over the chip for at least 25 min prior to injection of the next SynBP01 sample. Binding profiles were analyzed by using BIAevaluation software (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden), and the KD for binding of SynBP01 to SYNAGIS® was calculated as 16 μM. Examination of the Stability of SynBP01 The stability of SynBP01 to unfolding by urea at pH 7.0 was measured as described previously for Tn3 (See Example 1). To facilitate a comparison of chaotrope-induced unfolding of Tn3 and SynBP01, the relative fluorescence emission intensity at 360 nm was plotted as a function of chaotrope concentration for each protein. A comparison of urea-induced unfolding of Tn3 and SynBP01 at pH 7.0 (FIG. 9C) showed that the concentration of urea required to achieve 50% unfolding was similar for both proteins. This indicates that the stability of SynBP01 is similar to that of wild type Tn3. In other library screens, additional SYNAGIS® and Lysozyme specific binding scaffolds were identified. The specific BC and FG loops sequences are as follows: TABLE 3 BC and FG loop sequences of SYNAGIS ® and Lysozyme specific binding scaffolds Seq Clone BC loop ID NO: FG loop Seq ID NO: SYNAGIS ® specific binding scaffolds SynBP01 SPPSVLVGYTG 100 VTEFGRRRS 101 2 FKPLAEIDG 102 RKIIGLLSNPA 103 3 FKPLAEIDG 102 GTVVGQKSNPA 104 Lysozyme specific binding scaffolds 1 FKPLAEIDG 102 YNRYGLCPS 112 2 FKPLAEIDG 102 SNRIGMCPS 113 3 AQPTSPNGSIXG 114 RRGDMSSNPA 115 4 FKPLAEIDG 102 DTVHGRLSNPA 116 5 FKPLAEIDG 102 RKVLGRLSNPA 117 6 FKPLAEIDG 102 RKLVGALRS 118 7 FKPLAEIDG 102 RKVLRYSNPA 119 8 SPCNGGKRCTG 120 RRGDMSSNPA 121 9 FKPLAEIDG 102 FKWLGAIRS 122 10 FKPLAEIDG 102 GNCVGNLWS 123 11 SPAWITWHRTG 124 HTPLGHLRS 125 mAb Capture of Paired Scaffolds Bivalent or bispecific scaffolds, containing 2 identical or 2 distinct scaffolds, may be useful therapeutic molecules based on their ability to simultaneously bind 2 target proteins. A method of directly screening pairs of scaffolds for a desired bivalent or bispecific activity, without having to reformat and express tandem or fusion scaffolds, would vastly simply the process of identifying useful scaffold pairs. Only those pairs identified in the screen would then require reformatting into a form suitable for preparation of a bivalent or bispecific scaffold (for example, a multimeric scaffold). Full length IgG antibody molecules contain two antigen binding sites, and can therefore bind two target antigens simultaneously. Thus, noncovalent monoclonal antibody capture of scaffolds would result in presentation of two scaffolds on each antigen-binding arm of the antibody. If the scaffold captured in this way were oriented so that the binding surface formed by the BC, DE and FG loops were available for binding to other proteins, then this could form the basis for screening pairs of scaffolds. For this reason, capture by an antibody which recognizes an epitope involving the C-terminus of the scaffold, or any/all of the AB, CD, EF loops would be most suitable. Antibody capture of 2 identical scaffolds would result in formation of a homodimeric mAb-scaffold complex that could mimic the activity of a bivalent scaffold. Capture of 2 different scaffolds would result in a mixture of homo- and heterodimeric mAb-scaffold complexes, wherein the heterodimeric complex could mimic the activity of a bispecific scaffold. To demonstrate the feasibility of this assay strategy, different concentrations of PentaHis, an anti-histidine tag monoclonal antibody (Qiagen), was incubated for 2 h with 1 μM SynBP01 in HBS-EP buffer. PentaHis capture of SynBP01 was not expected to interfere with its ability to bind SYNAGIS®, given the C-terminal hexahistidine tag should be on the opposite side of the molecule to the binding surface formed by the BC, DE and FG loops (FIG. 9D). The PentaHis-SynBP01 samples were then injected over a BIAcore® chip onto which SYNAGIS® had been immobilized as previously described. The sensorgrams were corrected for background by subtraction of corresponding sensorgrams for injection of PentaHis in the absence of SynBP01, and then compared to the sensorgram obtained for injection of 1 μM SynBP01 in the absence of PentaHis. Binding of the PentaHis-SynBP01 complex to SYNAGIS® was significantly stronger than binding of free SynBP01, as exemplified by the sensorgram corresponding to the complex of 0.19 μM PentaHis with 1 μM SynBP01 (FIG. 9D) In particular, PentaHis-complexed SynBP01 had a much slower dissociation rate from the SYNAGIS® surface, indicative of bivalent binding, than did free SynBP01. Control experiments verified that PentaHis did not exhibit any detectable binding to SynBP01 when injected alone, nor did injection of a SynBP01/irrelevant mouse mAb mixture (isotype matched with PentaHis) show any evidence of enhanced binding relative to SynBP01 alone. 9.4 Example 4 Design, Expression and Characterization of Disulfide-stabilized Tn3 Variants Design of Disulfide-Containing Tn3 Variants While many naturally occurring Tn3 structural motifs lack disulfide bonds, others do contain one or more disulfide bonds. Thus, rather than attempt de novo design of disulfide bonds in Tn3 by measuring distances and angles between amino acid side chains, we introduced cysteine residues into the Tn3 scaffold at positions analogous to Tn3 structural domains that contain naturally occurring disulfides. The three dimensional structures of 21 Tn3 structural motifs that naturally contain disulfide bonds were superimposed. The PDB codes and sequences for these structures is shown in FIG. 10A-C. Within these 21 structures, disulfide bonds occurred at various positions within the scaffold, however, a number of these were analogous in that the disulfide bonds were overlaid within the family of superimposed structures. Three examples were found of disulfide bonds that were represented more than twice across the 21 structures. Two of these three correspond to the previously described disulfide bond pair commonly conserved within cytokine receptors (Bazan et al., PNAS, 87, 6934, 1990). A total of 8 and 12 instances of these two disulfides were noted in the 21 structures. The third disulfide occurs less frequently (5 cases/21 structures), and results in a crosslink between the F- and G-strands. Three cysteine-containing Tn3 mutants were designed in an effort to introduce disulfide bonds at positions corresponding to these 3 naturally occurring disulfides. A fourth cysteine-containing mutant was also designed to introduce a disulfide which occurs naturally in one of the Tn3 structural motifs from mouse G-CSF receptor (PDB code 1pgr). Although there was only one instance of this disulfide in the 21 structures, it results in a disulfide cross-link between the C- and F-strands that is buried within the protein core and occurs close to the BC and FG loop. For each of the Tn3 mutants, designated Tn3SS1-4, 2 cysteines were introduced at positions determined from the structure-based sequence alignment of Tn3 with those of the disulfide-containing Tn3 proteins (FIG. 10A). As disulfide 2 occurs across at the base of the DE loop in Tn3 structural motifs which often have longer DE loops than Tn3, 2 glycine residues were also inserted into the mutant corresponding to Tn3SS2. The disulfide engineering strategy is graphically depicted in FIG. 10D. Disulfide Mutant Generation and Recombinant Expression Expression constructs for Tn3SS1-4 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild type expression construct described in Example 1. Recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by immobilized nickel chelate affinity chromatography as described in Example 1. All Tn3 mutants expressed at a level in excess of 50 mg/L. Refolding of Tn3SS1-4 Cytoplasmic expression of proteins in E. coli generally results in the isolation of cysteine-containing proteins in the reduced state, or with some degree of inappropriate disulfide formation. To determine whether recombinant Tn3SS1-4 proteins were oxidized (i.e. disulfide-containing) or reduced (i.e. lacking disulfide bonds), purified material was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC, and compared to material that was first pre-incubated with the strong reducing agent DTT in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride. In all cases, DTT-treated material chromatographed as a single peak, while untreated samples showed the presence of a 2nd minor peak indicative of partial oxidation to the disulfide-containing form (Representative HPLC analyses of TnSS3 and TnSS4 are depicted in FIG. 10E). In order to effect complete conversion of reduced Tn3SS1-4 to the corresponding disulfide-containing proteins, samples were diluted to 1 mg/mL with 6M guanidine hydrochloride containing 10 mM DTT and buffered at pH 8. After 10 minutes incubation at room temperature, samples were dialyzed overnight against 0.5M guanidine hydrochloride buffered at pH 8.5 with 20 mM Tris-HCl. HPLC-analysis of material refolded in this way typically showed 30-70% conversion into the disulfide-containing species (FIG. 10E). Further conversion to 90-100% of the disulfide-containing species was affected by overnight incubation at 37° C., or by storing samples at 4° C. for >2 weeks. Alternatively, near quantitative refolding to the disulfide-containing product could be affected by overnight dialysis of reduced and denatured protein into buffer containing 0.5M guanidine hydrochloride, 4 mM reduced glutathione, 0.8 mM oxidized glutathione and buffered at pH 8.5 with 20 mM Tris-HCl. Characterization To determine purity and whether disulfide bonds within refolded Tn3SS1-4 samples were inter- or intramolecular, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions (FIG. 10F). In the presence of reducing agent, all refolded Tn3SS1-4 samples migrated at a similar position to Tn3. In the absence of reducing agent, Tn3SS1, Tn3SS3 and Tn3SS4 migrated similarly to Tn3, and were therefore expected to contain an intramolecular disulfide as designed. By contrast, Tn3SS2 migrated primarily as a dimer, with a small amount of protein migrating as a monomer. Accordingly, Tn3SS2 appears to form intermolecular disulfide-linked dimers and was therefore not studied further. Stability Unfolding of Tn3SS1,3,4 by chaotropic agents was monitored by intrinsic fluorescence as previously described for wild type Tn3. To facilitate a comparison of chaotrope-induced unfolding of wild type and disulfide-containing Tn3, the relative fluorescence emission intensity at 360 nm was plotted as a function of chaotrope concentration for each protein. A comparison of urea-induced unfolding of Tn3 and Tn3SS1,3,4 at pH 7.0 (FIG. 10G) showed that Tn3SS1 was less stable than the wild type protein, but that Tn3SS3 and Tn3SS4 were considerably more stable. At pH 7.0, the concentration of urea required to achieve 50% unfolding (Cm) of wild type Tn3 was 2M. By contrast, the Cm for unfolding of Tn3SS3 was 4M urea, while for Tn3SS4 Cm was at least 6M, but could not be accurately determined as this protein was not fully unfolded at the highest concentration of urea used in these experiments (8M). Unfolding of Tn3SS4 by guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) at pH 5.0 was also determined by fluorescence and compared to unfolding of wild type Tn3. Given GuHCl is a stronger denaturant than urea, a complete unfolding transition was obtained by analyzing the fluorescence of protein samples in concentrations of GuHCl ranging from 0 to 5.5M (FIG. 10H). The Cm for unfolding of wild type Tn3 at pH 5.0 was 1M GuHCl and approx. 3.2M for Tn3SS4. The stability of Tn3SS4 to proteolytic degradation was tested by incubation with thermolysin as previously described in Example 1 for the wild type protein. In contrast to the wild type protein, Tn3SS4 resisted proteolysis, even after overnight incubation at room temperature (FIG. 10I). Thermal unfolding of Tn3SS4 was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as previously described. A 1 mg/mL Tn3SS4 sample in 20 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.0 exhibited a melting temperature (Tm) of 71° C., which is 26° C. higher than the Tm of the wild type protein under the same conditions (FIG. 10J). The Tm was slightly elevated for Tn3SS4 in 20 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0. At this pH, the Tm for Tn3SS4 was 74° C. which is 18° C. higher than the wild type protein. As with the wild type protein, thermal unfolding of Tn3SS4 appeared completely reversible at pH 7.0, but resulted in precipitation at pH 5.0. Size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) was used to determine whether Tn3SS4 was monomeric in solution, using the same conditions previously described for the wild type protein. SEC-MALS analysis of a 2.0 mg/mL Tn3SS4 sample revealed that the protein was completely in the monomeric state (FIG. 10K). The experimentally-derived monomer mass was 10.7 kDa which is in close agreement with the calculated mass of 10.8 kDa. Preparation of a Dual-Disulfide Containing Tn3 Variant Given the enhanced stability of both the Tn3SS3 and Tn3SS4 variants relative to the wild type protein, a new Tn3 variant was prepared to determine whether the stabilizing effect of each disulfide bond would be additive in the context of a combination mutant. A construct for recombinant expression of this tetra-cysteine variant, designated Tn3SS3+4 was prepared by methods previously described and contained 4 cysteine residues at positions corresponding to disulfides 3 and 4 (see FIG. 10D). Protein was expressed and purified as previously described in Example 1. The yield of purified protein obtained for this variant was 22 mg from 200 mL E. coli culture. As this is the maximum binding capacity of the column used for purification, the actual expression level is at least 110 mg/L. Refolding of Tn3SS3+4 Purified Tn3SS3+4 was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC, and compared to material that was first preincubated with the strong reducing agent DTT in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride. While the DTT-treated material chromatographed as a single peak, untreated Tn3SS3+4 showed the presence of 3 additional earlier eluting peaks most likely due to partial formation of either or both potential disulfides bonds (FIG. 10L). In order to refold Tn3SS3+4 to the correct dual disulfide-containing protein, the sample was diluted to 1 mg/mL with 6M guanidine hydrochloride containing 10 mM DTT and buffered at pH 8. After 10 minutes incubation at room temperature, the sample was dialyzed overnight against 0.5M guanidine hydrochloride buffered at pH 8.5 with 20 mM Tris.HCl, and containing 4 mM reduced glutathione. HPLC-analysis of the refolded material indicated >95% conversion of the reduced protein to a single peak corresponding to the earliest eluting peak in the unfolded preparation. This product, by virtue of its elution time profile, was presumed to contain the 2 correctly formed disulfide bonds. (FIG. 10L). Characterization of Tn3SS3+4 Unfolding of Tn3SS3+4 by guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) at pH 5.0 was determined by fluorescence and compared to previous data for Tn3 and Tn3SS4. The Cm for unfolding of Tn3SS3+4 at pH 5.0 was between 5.0-5.5M GuHCl (FIG. 10M). which is considerably higher than the Cm for wild type or Tn3SS4. The significant enhancement in stability to GuHCl-induced denaturation suggests that the stabilizing effects of disulfides 3 and 4 are additive when both sets of mutations are combined into the one scaffold. 9.5 Example 5 Identification, Expression and Characterization of Tn3 Structural Motifs Derived from Hyperthermophilic Organisms Tn3 Structural Motif Identification A BLAST search was performed to identity putative Tn3 structural motif sequences encoded in the 48 archaeal genomes within the NCBI database. The search was further restricted to the genomes of hyperthermophilic organisms, which we define here as organisms which grow optimally at temperatures of 70° C. or higher. Tn3 was used as a query sequence, and this led to the identification of a Tn3 structural motif within a hypothetical protein from the organism Archaeoglobus fulgidus. This Tn3 structural motif was in turn used as the query sequence to identify further Tn3 structural motifs, and those in turn were used as query sequences. A total of 14 potential Tn3-coding sequences were identified within hypothetical proteins from 5 hyperthermophilic organisms. The sequences obtained are represented in Section 7 herein. Hyperthermophile Tn3 Expression and Purification Five of the predicted hyperthermophile-derived Tn3 proteins were selected for expression in E. coli. Synthetic cDNAs encoding each of these proteins, and optimized for codon usage in E. coli, were supplied by GenScript Corporation as per the sequences shown. Each cDNA contained flanking Nco I and Kpn I restriction sites, and following digestion with these enzymes, the inserts were cloned into a modified pET22b vector (Novagen) containing corresponding Nco I/Kpn I sites. Recombinant expression of the encoded C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged proteins and purification from E. coli lysates was performed according to the procedure previously described for human-derived Tn3 structural motifs. The Tn3 structural motif from Staphylothermus marinus, and both Tn3 structural motifs from Sulfolobus tokodaii expressed well, while Tn3 structural motifs from Sulfolobus solfataricus and Archeoglobus fulgidus expressed at a low level (FIG. 11A). Characterization The stability of each Tn3 structural motif, with the exception of the Tn3 from Sulfolobus solfataricus, was analyzed by DSC, fluorescence, and thermolysin-treatment as previously described (See Example 1). The thermograms for Tn3 structural motifs at from S. tokodaii at pH 7.0 did not exhibit a defined peak corresponding to thermal unfolding. Rather, the data showed that S. tokodaii 1Tn3 precipitated at temperatures above 70° C., while S. tokodaii 1Tn3 precipitated above 50° C. (FIG. 11C). The thermogram for the Tn3 structural motif from A. fulgidis showed a characteristic peak with Tm for unfolding of 77° C., as with the Tn3 structural motif from S. marinus which had a Tm of 83° C. (FIG. 11B). Thermal unfolding was not reversible for either of these two proteins, which precipitated at temperatures above Tm. Unfolding of the Tn3 structural motifs at pH 7.0 by guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) was analyzed by fluorescence. All Tn3 structural motifs required high concentrations of GuHCl to effect unfolding, with the midpoints of unfolding ranging from 4.5M to 6M GuHCl, as exemplified for the Tn3 from S. marinus (FIG. 11D). Stability to proteolysis by thermolysin was analysed using the same conditions previously described (See Example 1), where samples of 45 μM Tn3 were incubated with thermolysin at 0.45 μM. All Tn3 structural motifs were resistant to proteolysis, although rapid cleavage of small 1-2 kDa fragments was observed for Tn3 proteins from A. fulgidis, S. marinus and S. tokodaii 2Tn3 which we assume are N- and/or C-terminal fragments that do not form part of the core Tn3 structural motif. A significant proportion of all 4 core Tn3 structural motifs remained undigested after 16 hr thermolysin treatment, as exemplified for the Tn3 from S. marinus and S. tokodaii (2Tn3) (FIG. 11F+G). The stability of the Tn3 structural motifs from S. tokodaii was also assessed at pH 3.0 in 20 mM sodium citrate buffer, given this organism is acidophilic in addition to being hyperthermophilic. Both S. tokodaii 1Tn3 and 2Tn3 were more stable to GuHCl-induced unfolding at pH 3.0 compared to pH 7.0, with 1Tn3 being more stable than 2Tn3. Thermal unfolding of S. tokodaii 1Tn3 at pH 3.0 in 20 mM sodium citrate was also assessed by DSC. In contrast to thermal unfolding at pH 7.0, the thermogram at pH 3.0 showed a characteristic peak indicating a Tm of 98° C., moreover, unfolding at this pH was partially reversible. A comparison of thermal and GuHCl-mediated unfolding for S. tokodaii 1Tn3 is shown in (FIGS. 11C and 11E.) Exploiting Stability for Purification of Tn3 Structural Motifs The stability of hyperthermophile-derived Tn3 structural motifs to extremes of temperature, pH and proteolysis were exploited to purify these proteins from crude E. coli lysates. The Tn3 proteins from S. marinus and S. tokodaii (1Tn3) were expressed in E. coli and soluble lysates prepared as previously described. Lysate containing S. marinus Tn3 was heated at 70° C. for 15 minutes, precipated protein was removed by centrifugation, then supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and compared to lysate which had not been heated (FIG. 11H). As seen on the gel, a majority of E. coli contaminants were removed by the heat treatment resulting in significant purification of the Tn3 protein. Similarly, treatment of soluble E. coli lysate with thermolysin at 55° C. for 45 minutes also resulted in significant removal of E. coli-derived proteins and concomitant purification of the S. marinus Tn3 (FIG. 11I). The pH and high temperature stability of S. tokodaii 1Tn3 protein were utilized to remove E. coli proteins from crude lysate. Dilution of lysate, which was buffered at pH 7, with 4 volumes of 200 mM sodium citrate pH 3.0 resulted in significant precipitation of E. coli-derived proteins. After removal of precipitate by centrifugation, the supernatant was then heated at 70° C. for 15 minutes, and newly precipitated protein was again removed by centrifugation. SDS-PAGE analysis of untreated, pH 3-treated, and pH 3/heat-treated samples shows the dramatic removal of background E. coli proteins by these 2 steps (FIG. 11J). 9.6 Example 6 Loop Swapping Analysis of SynBP01 Summary Three different variants of SynBP01 were constructed to test if one loop or both the BC and FG loops were contributing to the binding interface of the Tn3 (FIG. 12). In addition, the Tn3SS4 mutation was added to test its affect on binding to SYNAGIS®. These variants differed in amino acid sequence from SynBP01 as follows: “SynBP01-BC only”—FG loop sequence replaced with RRGDMSSNPA (SEQ ID NO: 206) “SynBP01-FG only”—BC loop sequence replaced with FKPLAEIDG (SEQ ID NO: 202) “SynBP-1 SS4”—substitution of Ile and Ser, shown by line 4 in FIG. 10D, with Cys Experimental Procedure Phage display vector encoding gene 3 fragment fusions of SynBP01 and its 3 variants were transformed into E. coli, and these bacteria were then used to prepare phage displaying each of these Tn3 proteins as described in Example 3. Plates were coated with SYNAGIS® at 10 μg/ml in PBS pH 7.2 overnight at 4° C. Plates were blocked with PBS containing 0.1% v/v Tween-20 plus 4% w/v skim milk powder (PBST 4% milk). Diluted phage stocks were added to column 1 and a 3-fold serial dilution was performed across the plate using PBST 1% milk as diluent. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours with gentle shaking After washing, bound phage were labeled with anti-M13 HRP conjugated antibody (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.) and detected colorimetrically by addition of TMB substrate (KPL Laboratories, Gaithersburg, Md.). The absorbance was read at 450 nm after quenching the color development by addition of 2.5M phosphoric acid. Results: The data presented in FIG. 12 demonstrates that both the BC and FG loops are required for binding of the Tn3 scaffold to SYNAGIS®. SynBP01 variants containing a substitution of either loop with the wild type Tn3 sequence did not exhibit binding to plate bound SYNAGIS®. These results demonstrate that at least two loops of the Tn3 scaffold act cooperatively to present a functional binding surface. In addition, the introduction of the SS4 disulfide bond into the SynBP01 scaffold ablates binding to SYNAGIS® (FIG. 12). A loss of activity for the SS4-containing variant of SynBP01 is probably due to a subtle conformational effect given this disulfide is not expected to result in a large change in the structure of a Tn3 scaffold protein. This further suggests that binding of SYNAGIS® is exquisitely dependent on the three dimensional structure of SynBP01. 9.7 Example 7 Construction of a 2 Loop Library on the Tn3SS4 Scaffold A new library was constructed based upon the Tn3SS4 scaffold shown in FIG. 10D. The BC loop diversity was introduced using PCR and the FG loop diversity was introduced using Kunkel mutagenesis (Table 5.). A library of approximately 1.12×1010 members was constructed.

These primers annealed on their 3′ ends to the Tn3 DNA and the degeneracy formed a library upon completion of the PCR. These PCR products were amplified with flanking primers to make a complete Tn3 gene which was then digested with NcoI and KpnI and ligated into the phage display vector. The DNA was transformed into E. coli by electroporation. The final diversity of the BC library was estimated to be about 3.4×109 members. After electroporation, the BC library was incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. with shaking M13K07 helper phage was added and after one hour the cells were diluted to a larger volume and grown at 37° C. with shaking overnight. The next day phage were removed and concentrated from the supernatant by precipitation with PEG 8000. BC library phage was used to infect CJ236 E. coli. After a one hour infection, cells were diluted into 2×YT with 100 μg/mL carbenicillum and grown overnight with shaking at 37° C. The next day phage were removed and concentrated from the supernatant by precipitation with PEG 8000. Single stranded DNA was recovered by using a Qiagen (Valencia, Calif.) QIAprep spin M13 kit. This DNA served as the template for Kunkel mutagenesis using the FG primers in Table 5. 9.8 Example 8 Panning the Two Loop Tn3SS4 Library for SYNAGIS® Specific Scaffolds SYNAGIS® was biotinylated with 15 molar equivalents of EZ Link sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). After incubation for 1 hour at room temperature, the sample was dialyzed in PBS overnight to remove unconjugated biotin. The next day M280 streptavidin beads (Dynal, Carlsbad, Calif.) and the two loop library were blocked in PBS containing 10 mg/ml BSA for 1 hour. 10 ug of biotinylated SYNAGIS® were added to the blocked phage and incubated at room temperature on an end-over-end rotating mixer for two hours. SYNAGIS® was captured with the blocked streptavidin beads for 30 min on the rotating mixer at room temperature. After three washes with PBST to remove unbound phage, the bound phage were eluted with 75 mM DTT. XL-1 Blue E. coli were infected with eluted phage, co-infected with M13KO7 helper phage and repropagated overnight as described in Example 3. The next day, phage were harvested from overnight culture media as described in Example 3. The second round of panning was the same as the first with casein used at 10 mg/ml as the blocking reagent. The beads used for the second round were Spherotech (Lake Forest, Ill.) avidin-coated magnetic particles. For the third round, casein was used as the blocking reagent and M280 streptavidin beads were used to capture SYNAGIS®. For the fourth round BSA was used as the blocking reagent and Spherotech avidin magnetic particles were used to capture SYNAGIS®. After 4 rounds of panning, E. coli were infected with eluted phage and plated. Individual colonies were cultured in 96 well format, infected with M13KO7, and culture supernatant was used in a phage ELISA to identify SYNAGIS® binding clones. Three new SS4 stabilized clones were identified, the sequences of which are shown in Table 6.

After overnight incubation at 4° C., a control IgG1 antibody or TRAIL-R2/Fc fusion protein (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) was added, and again incubated overnight at 4° C. The beads were washed with PBST and blocked in PBST 2% milk prior to use. The two loop Tn3SS4 phage library was incubated overnight at 4° C. with the control IgG1 antibody-coated beads to deplete the library of binders to the beads or human IgG1 Fc. The depleted library was then added to TRAIL-R2 coated beads and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature on a rocking platform. Beads were washed with PBST and added to XL-1 Blue E. coli to propagate bound phage as described in Example 8. This panning procedure was repeated for 4 more rounds, except that incubation with control antibody beads for background depletion was performed for 1 hour rather than overnight. Individual clones were analyzed by phage ELISA after the fourth and fifth rounds of panning to identify TRAIL-R2 binding variants. Following the sequencing of positive clones from the TRAIL-R2 phage ELISA, nine unique binding clones were identified (Table 7). A lower case q indicates that a TAG stop codon was at that position. A suppressor strain such as XL-1 Blue allows for expression of genes with a TAG stop codon by inserting a glutamine at this position.

Separately, a blank surface was also prepared on the same chip using the identical coupling protocol, minus the protein. This blank surface was used as a reference cell throughout the experiment, and served to correct for both non-specific binding and certain housekeeping artifacts. TRAIL-R2/Fc protein was prepared at 100 nM in instrument buffer in (HBS-EP buffer, BIAcore, Inc., consisting of the following: 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% P20.), then injected over both the Fc-capture and control surfaces at a flow rate of 75 uL/min. Capture levels of the ligand approximated 800 RUs. After baseline stabilization, solutions of the Tn3 clone 5E5 (Table 7) were injected over both the captured ligand and control surfaces. Between injections, the Fc-capture surface was regenerated with two 1 min. injections of 10 mM Gly, pH2. Several buffer and control protein injections were also interspersed throughout the injection series. Later, these buffer injections were used, along with the reference cell data, to correct the raw data sets for injection artifacts and/or non-specific ‘binding’ through a technique commonly referred to as “double-referencing.” (Myszka, D. G. (1999) J. Mol. Recognit. 12, pp. 279-284). Sensorgram overlays of the fully corrected data were generated using the BIAevaluation 4.1 software (BIAcore, Inc, Uppsala, Sweden). The affinity of 5E5 for binding to TRAIL-R2 was calculated by measuring the kon and koff. values in the BIAevaluation software for the sensorgram shown in FIG. 13. This analysis resulted in an estimated Kd of 700 nM for 5E5 binding to TRAIL-R2. 9.11 Example 11 Competition for Binding to TRAIL-R2 with Clones 5E5 and 7G11 Soluble 5E5 and 7G11 (TRAIL-R2 specific clones isolated in Example 9) were expressed and used in a competition phage ELISA assay to assess whether they specifically bind TRAIL-R2. TRAIL-R2 coated plates were incubated with phage displaying TRAIL-2 specific Tn3′ sin the presence or absence of soluble Tn3 clones 7G11 or 5E5. As shown in FIG. 14, soluble 5E5 competes with phage displayed 5E5 and all other phage displayed clones except 2H6 and 7G11. Soluble 7G11 only competes with phage displayed 7G11 and 2H6. This experiment indicates that all clones are specific for TRAIL-R2 and that there are two different epitopes on TRAIL-R2 recognized by this panel of Tn3 proteins. 9.12 Example 12 Construction of a Three Loop Tn3SS4 Library A phage displayed three loop library based on the Tn3SS4 scaffold was made by randomizing the sequences of the BC, DE, and FG loops using the primers shown in Table 8. Briefly, single stranded DNA from the two loop Tn3 BC loop library with Tn3SS4 (from Example 7) was used as a template for a PCR with the DE rev primer in Table 8. This PCR generated a product that contained a portion of the Tn3 gene with BC and DE randomization. A second PCR used this BC, DE loop randomized PCR product as template for amplification with the FG primers listed in Table 8. The resulting PCR products were amplified with flanking primers to make a complete Tn3 gene which was then cut NcoI to KpnI and ligated into the phage display vector. The DNA was transformed into E. coli by electroporation. After electroporation, the library was incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. with shaking M13K07 helper phage was added and after one hour the cells were diluted to a larger volume and grown at 37° C. with shaking overnight. The next day phage were purified from the culture supernatant by precipitation with a saline PEG 8000 solution. The library size was estimated to contain about 1.5×109 members based on the number of E. coli transformants.

These Tn3 clones, along with 1E3, 1C12, and 2B4 were cloned into a E. coli expression vector (described in Example 1) and transformed into BL21 DE3 cells. After induction with IPTG, the transformed bacteria were grown for 5 hours at 30° C. The cells were pelleted, lysed by sonication, and the soluble fraction was purified on a HiTrap chelating HP column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Tn3 clones 2B4 and 1C12 were obtained in good yield, however, a poor recovery of the remaining three clones was the result of overexpression leading to accumulation of the proteins into inclusion bodies. In this case, a high yield of Tn3 was subsequently obtained by solubilizing the inclusion bodies in buffered 6M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), then purifying on a HiTrap chelating column under denaturing conditions. All Tn3s were subsequently refolded by dialysis of reduced and denatured samples into native buffer in the presence of a cysteine/cystine redox pair. 9.14 Example 14 Determining Epitope Diversity A selection of the phage displayed clones from Table 9 were tested to see if soluble forms of Tn3s 1E3, 1G11, 2B4, 1C12 and 2D3 would compete for binding to TRAIL-R2 in a phage ELISA. The assay was performed in a similar manner to the competition for binding in Example 11, and the results are shown in FIGS. 15 A, B, and C. Soluble Tn3 clones 1E3, 1C12, and 2D3 significantly inhibited the binding of most of the phage linked Tn3s to TRAIL R2, with the exception of clones 8B3 and 7G11. Soluble 1G11 did not significantly compete with any of the phage bound clones. Soluble 2B4 showed little to moderate inhibition in most cases. The fact that 1E3, 1C12, and 2D3 competed with the same set of phage linked Tn3s indicates that these three soluble Tn3s and the phage linked Tn3s likely bind to the same epitope on TRAIL-R2. 9.15 Example 15 Cell Viability Assays Using Tn3 Monomers Linked to an Anti-his Monoclonal Antibody Colo 205 is a cell line which is highly sensitive to TRAIL-induced killing. TRAIL-R2 binding Tn3s, when multimerized via binding to a complex of mouse anti-His tag antibody and anti-mouse IgG, were tested for their ability to induce killing of Colo205 cells. Colo205 cells in 100 ul of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS were plated into each well of a flat bottom 96-well culture plate and incubated overnight at 37° C. Tn3 proteins 7G11 and 5E5 (Table 7), 1C12, 2D3 and 1E3 (Table 9) and Tn3SS4 (Example 4) were incubated with mouse anti-His tag antibody (Penta-His; Qiagen Inc) and rabbit anti mouse IgG in a molar ratio of 2:1:0.5. Serial dilutions of each Tn3 complex was made in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS to a final concentration of 5 μM, 1.66 μM, 0.55 μM, 0.185 μM and 0 μM based on the Tn3 content. After removal of medium from cells cultured overnight, 100 μl of the Tn3-antibody complexes was added. Each assay point was performed in triplicate. After addition of Tn3 complexes, the cells were incubated for 3 days in at 37° C., after which cell viability was measured in a CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay (Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.) according to the manufacturers instructions. The percent viability for cells treated with a TRAIL-R2 binding Tn3s was calculated by dividing the luminescent signal obtained in the CellTiter-Glo® assay by the corresponding signal obtained for cells treated with the same concentration of non TRAIL-R2 binding control Tn. The cell viability assay (FIG. 16) showed that Tn3 clones 5E5, 1C12 and 2D3, when multimerized via antibody complexation, were able to inhibit Colo205 viability in a dose-dependent manner relative to treatment of cells with a non-TRAIL-R2 binding Tn3. Inhibition of cell viability was presumably due to cellular apoptosis triggered by TRAIL-R2 ligation, although pathway-specific assays would be needed to confirm this. Clones 7G11 and 1E3 did not show detectable activity at the concentrations used in the assay. Additional cell assays showed that none of the active Tn3 proteins affected cell viability when assayed without an anti-His tag capture antibody. This demonstrates that activity is dependent on the presentation of multimerized TRAIL-R2 binding moieties. Clone 5E5 also lacked activity if the anti-IgG antibody was not present, however, clones 1C12 and 2D3 were active in the absence of anti-IgG, suggesting that dimeric presentation via anti His-tag antibody capture is sufficient to trigger TRAIL-R2 signaling. 9.16 Example 16 Construction of Polyvalent Anti TRAIL R2 Tn3 Antibody Fusions Given the requirement for presentation of oligomeric Tn3 complexes to effect TRAIL-R2-dependent cell killing, Tn3 fusion constructs were designed for the production of bi- and tetravalent Tn3-containing proteins (FIG. 17). A bivalent Tn3 construct was designed by fusion of Tn3 to the Fc region of human IgG1, while a two chain tetravalent Tn3 construct was designed based on co-expression of a Tn3-Cκ fusion with Tn3-IGHG1, i.e Tn3 fused to a human C-kappa region, and to the heavy chain constant region of human IgG1. The latter construct is similar in nature to an antibody, except that the light and heavy chain variable regions were replaced with a Tn3 moiety. The constructs shown in FIGS. 17A and B, were expressed in 293F cells transiently transfected with the in-house pOE expression vector coding for each of the proteins. After 10 days in culture, media (250 mL) was harvested, and the protein was purified by protein A affinity chromatography. Presented in Table 10 are the expression levels of a selection of multivalent Tn3 constructs. 1C12 and a control SYNAGIS® binding Tn3 named D1 (from Example 8 Seq ID NO: 105 and Seq ID NO 106) expressed well as either the Fc fusion, or two chain Tn3-Cκ/Tn3-IGHG1 fusions. Hybrid tetravalent fusions of 1C12 and 2D3 (1C12 linked to IGHG1, 2D3 linked to Cκ and vice versa) along with the 2D3 Fc fusion yielded lower amounts of material, while the two chain 2D3-Cκ/2D3-IGHG1 fusion did not express SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein A purified proteins is shown in FIG. 18. TABLE 10 Yield of Different Fc fusion and Tetravalent Antibody Fusion Constructs # Name Final 1 D1-Fc 15 mg 2 1C12-Fc 15 mg 3 2D3-Fc 3.5 mg 4 D1-Cκ/D1-IGHG1 13 mg 5 1C12-Cκ/1C12-IGHG1 10 mg 6 2D3-Cκ/1C12-IGHG1 4 mg 7 1C12-Cκ/2D3-IGHG1 4 mg Biosensor Assays of 1C12, 1C12 Fc, and 1C12 Tetravalent A qualitative comparison of binding by monomeric 1C12, 1C12-Fc and 1C12-Cκ/1C12-IGHG1 proteins was performed by injecting samples of each of these proteins over a TRAIL-R2 chip on an Attana biosensor instrument. As shown in FIG. 19, complexes of TRAIL-R2 with oligomerized forms of 1C12 show a substantial improvement in affinity relative to monomeric 1C12. The specificity of binding was demonstrated by injection of D1-Fc and D1-Cκ/D1-IGHG1 proteins which did not interact with immobilized TRAIL-R2. The dissociation rates for the different 1C12 constructs followed the order 1C12>1C12-Fc>1C12-Cκ/1C12-IGHG1, consistent with the bi- and tetravalent constructs exhibiting avidity in their interaction with TrailR2. 9.17 Example 17 Cell Viability Assays Using Polyvalent Anti TRAIL-R2 Tn3 Fusion Proteins H2122 cells were plated in 96 well plates at a density of 10000 cells/well in 50 ul of complete medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS). Cells were incubated overnight at 37° C. The next day, polyvalent Tn3 fusion proteins (Fc fusions or two chain tetravalent constructs) alone or in combination with goat anti-human Fc were serially diluted in complete medium. To achieve a dose curve, a 3-fold dilution scheme was used (highest final concentration was 3.6 uM). The goat anti-human Fc was added at a 1:2 molar ratio (i.e. half of the concentration of the Tn3-containing molecule). Tn3 and anti-human Fc alone and in combination were prepared at a 2× concentration (50 ul of each treatment were added per well). All treatments were done in triplicate wells. Commercially available TRAIL ligand (Chemicon Cat# GF092) was used as a positive control for Trail-induced cell death. The final concentrations for Trail were 1, 0.1, and 0.01 nM. After 48 hrs, the CellTiter-Glo kit from Promega was used to determine cell viability. Briefly, cells are allowed to equilibrate for about 10 min to room temperature. CellTiter-Glo buffer and substrate were mixed to prepare the CellTiter-Glo reagent as indicated by manufacturer. Each well received 100 ul of the CellTiter-Glo reagent and the plate was incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to reading luminescence in a Wallac Plate reader. Results are shown in FIGS. 20-22. Each of the 1C12 and 2D3 containing polyvalent constructs were able to inhibit the viability of H2122 cells, presumably by activating TRAIL-R2 dependent apoptosis, moreover this activity was not dependent on higher order crosslinking via coordination with an anti-Fc antibody. The tetrameric form of 1C12 was more potent in the cell assay than its dimer form (compare FIGS. 20 and 21), consistent with the killing activity being a function of the valency. Fc-cross-linking did not increase the potency of killing and appeared to reduce the activity of the monospecific 1C12 constructs. Neither D1-Fc nor D1-Cκ/D1-IGHG1 control proteins, which do not bind TRAIL-R2, affected cell viability. The bispecific tetravalent constructs (FIG. 22) had the greatest potency in inhibiting H2122 cell viability, and this increased slightly if co-incubated with anti-Fc antibody. The improvement in activity for the 2D3/1C12 bispecific constructs relative to monospecific 1C12-Cκ/1C12-IGHG1 may be due to superior potency for 2D3 vs 1C12 Tn3 units, or because 2D3 and 1C12 recognize different epitopes on TRAIL-R2 which could result in higher order aggregation of cell surface TRAIL-R2. 9.18 Example 18 Bacterial Secretion of Tn3 Scaffolds A bacterial expression vector was designed to secrete correctly folded Tn3 scaffold in E. coli. This system would allow for correct disulfide bond formation within Tn3 and therefore avoid the refolding process that is required for material expressed intracellularly as described in Example 4. To create a secretion vector, an intracellular Tn3 expression vector, similar to that described in Example 4, but containing a Ptac promoter instead of T7, was modified by insertion of the signal peptide sequence from E. coli oligopeptide binding protein (oppA). This signal sequence, cloned immediately upstream of Tn3, was chosen because oppA is a highly expressed E. coli protein. An extended 8×His tag was encoded downstream of Tn3 to facilitate purification. To simplify the transfer of Tn3 cassettes between this and other plasmids, a modified form of this vector was also created by introducing an Nco I site at the 3′ end of the oppA signal sequence. This modification results in a single amino acid substitution (L25M) at the penultimate position within the oppA signal sequence (FIG. 23). These vectors were referred to as pSec-oppA-Tn3 and pSec-oppA(L25M)-Tn3. Superbroth media containing carbenicillum (100 ug/mL, 1% glucose) was innoculated with E. coli BL21 DE3 cultures transformed with pSec-oppA-Tn3 or pSec-oppA(L25M)-Tn3. Cultures were grown at 37° C. to an OD of 0.5-0.8 then induced with 0.2 mM IPTG. After shaking at 37° C. for 5 hours, cells were separated from the media by centrifugation. Periplasmic extracts were prepared by resuspending the cell pellet in 1/10 volume of ice-cold extraction buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8 and 1 mM EDTA), incubating on ice for 10 min, then centrifuging to remove cells. Samples of periplasmic extract and media were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Tn3 could be detected in both media and periplasmic fractions, and expression levels were similar for constructs containing the wild type or L25M oppA signal peptides (FIG. 24A). As pSec-oppA(L25M)-Tn3 contains a convenient 5′ Tn3 cloning site, this construct is preferred for the expression of Tn3 clones derived from display libraries. Purification of Tn3 from media was effected by precipitating the secreted protein with 65% w/v ammonium sulfate, resuspending the pellet in 50 mM Tris pH 8 buffer, then purifying on a HiTrap chelating column charged with Ni2+ as previously described. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified sample is shown in FIG. 24B. Purified Tn3 was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (as described herein), either with or without DTT pretreatment to reduce any disulfide bonds. Tn3 eluted as a single peak, and the elution time shifted after reduction with DTT indicating the purified sample contained a disulfide bond as expected (FIG. 23C). Non-reducing SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography of this material were consistent with a single monomeric species, and mass spectrometric analysis gave a molecular weight of 10,896 Da which is within 3 Da of the predicted molecular weight for the mature, disulfide-containing sequence shown in FIG. 28A. Finally, the expression level of secreted Tn3 in media was determined in a biosensor assay. Anti-His tag antibody (Penta-His, Qiagen Inc.) was immobilized onto an Attana A100 carboxyl sensor chip via standard amine coupling. E. coli BL21 DE3 were transformed with pSec-oppA(L25M)-Tn3, and protein expression was induced as described above. Dilutions of clarified media were injected over the chip, and levels of bound His-tag containing Tn3 were compared to that generated from injection of purified Tn3 standard. By this technique, the level of Tn3 detected in crude media was 250 mg/L. 9.19 Example 19 Generation of SynBP01-Fc Fusion Summary: A chimeric fusion of a SYNAGIS®-binding Tn3 and the Fc region of IgG1 was generated. Methods: Expression of SynBP01-Fc As described above, SynBP01 is a Tn3 variant which was identified from a library of BC loop and FG loop-randomized Tn3 variants panned against SYNAGIS®. Flanking NheI and KasI sites were introduced by silent mutagenesis and utilized to subclone this construct into the pOE-Fc vector. The pOE-Fc vector contains the CH2 and CH3 domains of IgG1 Fc, which is 3′ to the KasI restriction sites. The vector generated by subcloning SynBP01 into pOE-Fc was named pOE-SynBP01. 293EBNA cells (120 mL culture volume) were transfected with pOE-SynBP01 through Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), using standard methods. Supernatant was harvested 10 days post-transfection, and SynBP01-Fc was purified through Protein A affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare), eluting with 0.1M glycine, 0.15M NaCl, pH 3.08, and neutralizing with Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8. The purified sample was then dialyzed against PBS buffered at pH 7.2. The yield of purified SynBP01-Fc was 4 mg, indicating an expression level of 33 mg/L. BIAcore Analysis of SynBP01-Fc BIAcore analysis of this molecule was conducted on a BIAcore 3000 (GE Healthcare), as described in Example 3. This experiment was designed to determine whether the SynBP01-Fc was competent to bind SYNAGIS, and to detect qualitatively the difference in apparent affinity between the original SynBP01 binder and the Fc fusion. Results: When injected at equivalent 1 μM concentrations, SynBP01-Fc yielded an approximately 6-fold increase in total response units compared to SynBP01 (FIG. 26). Moreover, SynBP01-Fc had a substantially reduced off-rate relative to SynBP01, due primarily to the increased avidity of the bivalent Fc fusion. Although the dissociation constant (KD) of the SynBP01-Fc/SYNAGIS® interaction was not determined in this experiment, as the binding surface had not been prepared for a kinetic analysis, it is evident that the KD is improved from the KD of 16 μM seen with the SynBP01/SYNAGIS® interaction in Example 3. 9.20 Example 20 Site-Specific PEGylation of STn3 Scaffold Modification of a protein through PEGylation is frequently used to improve its therapeutic properties, such as decreased immunogenicity, improved pharmacokinetics and bioavailability by increasing the effective size of small proteins so as to avoid renal clearance. Site-specific modification with PEG, that is attachment at one or more specific residues in the protein, can avoid inactivation of a target proteins activity that could otherwise result from attachment of PEG at or near a functional site within a protein. To demonstrate site-specific PEGylation of a Tn3-like scaffold protein, a cysteine residue was engineered at the C-terminus of STn3 (S. tokodaii 1Tn3 from Example 5). As the wild type sequence of STn3 does not contain cysteine, treatment of the engineered scaffold with a Cys-specific PEGylation reaction would lead to site-specific attachment of PEG. STn3 had previously been expressed as a fusion to a C-terminal 6×His tag, in a variant of the pET-22b vector (Novagen). This vector contains the linker sequence GGGLE between the protein and the His tag. A variation on the QuikChange (Stratagene) mutagenesis method was used to mutate the leucine residue in the linker to a cysteine, which can be modified by a maleimide reagent. This protein is referred to as STn3(CTC), and was expressed and purified from BL21(DE3) cells using an IMAC column as described in Example 1. The PEGylation reagent, Sunbright Me.-200MA (NOF), was added to STn3(CTC) at a 4:1 molar excess (PEG reagent:protein), and was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 72 hours. Protein PEGylation was monitored by SDS-PAGE (FIG. 27A, lane 5), which revealed that the majority of the protein had been PEGylated by a single PEG moiety. As PEGylation typically has the effect of masking surface charge of a protein, the pH for cation-exchange chromatography was lowered from 6.0 (for wild-type purification) to 4.5, to ensure that the protein would effectively bind the column. The protein was purified on a 1 mL SP XL column (GE Healthcare) using 50 mM acetic acid, pH 4.5. A sodium chloride gradient was used to elute the protein, with the protein peak occurring at approximately 120 mM NaCl. Successful removal of residual unPEGylated STn3(CTC) from the PEGylated product is demonstrated by SDS-PAGE analysis of fractions obtained from the cation exchange purification fractions are shown in FIG. 27B, lanes 1-5.) 9.21 Example 21 Analysis of AB, CD and EF Loops and Design of Randomized Library To design Tn3 libraries which were randomized in the AB, CD and EF loops, a bioinformatic analysis was performed to derive information regarding the length and sequence diversity of these loops in naturally occurring Fn3 domains. Due to the difficulty in predicting the AB, CD and EF loop regions based on sequence information alone, the three dimensional structures of 103 different Fn3 domains from the pdb database were superimposed, and this was used to align the corresponding amino acid sequences (data not shown). The locations of the loops regions were used to extract length and sequence diversity information for each of the loops. The variation in length for each of the AB, CD and EF loops is shown graphically in FIG. 28. As with loops on the opposite side of the Tn3 molecule, the AB, CD and EF loops vary in length and sequence composition for different Fn3 domains. The AB and CD loops are usually 5 to 9 amino acids long, although exceptions occur for some Fn3 domains which have AB and/or CD loops longer or shorter than this. The most common length within this data set was 6 residues for the CD loop (31% of sequences), and 7 residues for the AB loop (61% of sequences). Length variation occurs less frequently for the EF loop, and an 8 residue loop is most commonly observed (80% of sequences). Both the AB and CD loops show significant diversity in sequence and do not show overt preferences for specific amino acids in particular positions. An exception is the final position in the AB loop which is often Ser or Thr (58/103 sequences). The sequences of EF loops reveals strongly preferred amino acids at specific positions, though this is restricted to those that are 8 residues long. A Leu at position 3 within these loops is strongly conserved (76/82 sequences), and given the sidechain of this residue is buried in each of the structures, it is likely to be important for the structural integrity of the scaffold. A Pro residue is also commonly observed at position 5 (44/82 sequences), while Gly, Asn, Asp and Ser are often in position 2 (71/82 sequences) and Thr in position 7 (40/82). A further practical consideration in the design of these Tn3 libraries was to identify an alternative to the “NNK” (N=A, G, T, C; K=G, T) mixed codon scheme typically used in degenerate oligonucleotides to code for any amino acid. Although the “NNK” mixture gives 32 different codons which code for all 20 amino acids, they are not encoded equally (Table 11). For instance, 3/32 codons in the “NNK” scheme code for Leu (CTG, CTT, TTG), but only 1/32 codes for Asp (GAT). In addition, the “NNK” mixture encodes one stop codon (TAG) and a Cys codon (TGT), neither of which is desirable when generating naiive libraries. In considering an alternative scheme, we took note of the fact that synthetic antibody libraries have been described which encode CDR sequences composed of a small subset of amino acids. Antibody libraries with CDR's composed of just 4 amino acids (Tyr, Ala, Asp, Ser), or even a binary pair (Tyr, Ser) have been shown to yield specific high affinity mAbs to protein antigens (Fellouse et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004, 101: 12467-72; J. Mol. Biol. 2005, 348: 1153-62). Similarly, a library of scaffold proteins with randomized loop sequences comprising just Tyr and Ser also yielded specific binders to a protein target (Koide et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007, 104: 6632-7). Although libraries containing highly restricted sets of amino acids are able to produce specific binding proteins, it is likely that the diversity of binders that are obtained from such a library will be limited. We therefore designed an alternate “NHT” mixed codon scheme for introducing diversity into a Tn3 library (H=A, T, C). “NHT” mixes code for a reasonable subset of the 20 amino acids, but avoid the disadvantages described with “NNK” mixed codons (Table 12). This scheme generates 12 codons that code for 12/20 amino acids, that is, each codon codes for a unique amino acid. Moreover, there are no stop or Cys codons.

As high salt concentrations can mask surface protein charge, while buffer acidification can result in neutralization of negatively charged Asp and Glu side chains, these observations suggest that surface negative charge on Tn3 has a destabilizing effect. To explore the potential for enhancing the stability of Tn3 through engineering of surface charge, the locations of Asp and Glu side chains were mapped onto the three dimensional structure of Tn3. From a total of 18 Asp and Glu residues contained in Tn3 (SEQ ID 1), a panel of 8 mutants were designed in which individual Asp or Glu residues were replaced with the neutral isoteric residues Asn or Gln (FIG. 30A). The selection of the 8 substitution sites was biased towards Asp and Glu residues that were in close proximity to another Asp or Glu, given proximity of like charges can contribute to destabilization through electrostatic repulsion. Charge Mutant Generation and Recombinant Expression Expression constructs for Tn3 mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild type expression construct as described previously. Recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by immobilized nickel chelate affinity chromatography as described previously. All Tn3 mutants expressed at high levels and were readily purified, although the preparation of the E54Q mutant did contain some impurities as evidenced by SDS-PAGE analysis (FIG. 30B). Characterization of Stability Unfolding of charge mutants by urea was monitored by intrinsic fluorescence as previously described for wild type Tn3. To facilitate a comparison of urea-induced unfolding profiles of wild type and charge mutants of Tn3, the relative fluorescence emission intensity at 360 nm was plotted as a function of urea concentration for each protein. A comparison of urea-induced unfolding at pH 7.0 for wild type Tn3 and the various charge mutants (FIG. 31A) showed that 3 of the mutants (D4ON, E54Q and E67Q) had the same or slighty lower stability than the wild type protein. Five of the mutants (E33Q, D49N, E52Q, D53N, E86Q) showed small but clearly defined increases in the midpoints of urea-induced unfolding, suggestive of an increase in protein stability. The concentration of urea required to induce 50% unfolding was approximately 0.5M higher for best 3 mutants (E33Q, D49N and E86Q) than for wild type Tn3. Preparation and Analysis of Tn3 Variants Containing Multiple Charge Mutations Given the enhanced stability of a number of the Tn3 charge variants, new Tn3 variants containing combined charge mutations were prepared to investigate whether additive improvements in stability could be obtained. To this end, three new variants were prepared containing paired mutations (D49N/E86Q and E33Q/D49N) or a triple mutation (E33Q/D49N/E86Q). These mutants were recombinantly expressed and purified, and their urea denaturation profiles were characterized by fluorescence. When compared to the single charge mutants of Tn3, each of the combination mutants showed further enhancement of stability as determined by the increase in urea concentration required for unfolding (FIG. 31B). While the midpoint of urea-induced unfolding of the individual charge mutants E33Q, D49N and E86Q occurred at ˜2.5M urea, the midpoint of unfolding for each of the D49N/E86Q, E33Q/D49N and E33Q/D49N/E86Q mutants corresponded to ˜3.0M urea. This indicates that combined replacement of multiple destabilizing Asp or Glu residues can lead to an additive improvement in Tn3 stability, although in the examples studied here, a triple mutant was no more stable than a double mutant. To further characterize the stabilities of the combination charge mutants relative to wild type Tn3, these proteins were analyzed by DSC at pH 7 as previously described. This analysis further confirmed that the charge mutations led to an improvement in the stability of the Tn3 scaffold. While the wild type protein had a mid-point of thermal unfolding (Tm) of 45° C., the E33Q/D49N Tn3 mutant had a Tm of 50° C., while D49N/E86Q and E33Q/D49N/E86Q mutants had Tm's of 52° C. (FIG. 32).
