Further, the skirt portion 25 outside of the perforations 22a is formed of a rubber sponge shown in Fig. 9Α. The opening 2 7a formed on the outside of the perforations 22a is configured to expose projections 24Ρ-24℮ of the rubber sponge 20Ρ-20℮ to the outside, as to be described later. Similarly, Fig. 9Β is a diagram for explaining an example of a disposable rubber sponge 20b to be used in the present embodiment. In this embodiment, the disposable rubber sponge 20a includes a mesh portion 21b having a predetermined size at the middle, a circular perforations 22b is formed outside the mesh portion 21b, and a projection 24b is formed at a rubber sponge portion 23b formed between the mesh portion 21b and the circular perforations 22b. However, in the case of the disposable rubber sponge 20b, the perforations 22b outside of the mesh portion 21b is formed outside the perforations 22a of the disposable rubber sponge 20a. The opening 27b formed on the outside of the perforations 22b is configured to expose the projections 24c-24e to be described later of the rubber sponge 20ο-20℮, Similarly, Fig. 9C is a diagram for explaining an example of a disposable rubber sponge 20c to be used in the present embodiment. In this embodiment, the disposable rubber sponge 20c includes a mesh portion 21c having a predetermined size at the middle, a circular perforations 22c is formed outside the mesh portion 21c, and a projection 24c is formed at a rubber sponge portion 23b formed between the mesh portion 21b and the circular perforations 22c, wherein the circular perforations 22c outside of the mesh portion 21c is positioned at a position of the perforations 22b of the disposable rubber sponge 20b. The opening 27c formed on the outside of the perforations 22c is cοηfigu.red to expose th℮ ρrοjectiοηs 24d■■■ 24e tο be described later of the rubber sponge 20d-20e. Similarly, in the case of the disposable rubber sponge 20α, as shown in Fig. 9D, the disposable rubber sponge 20d includes a mesh portion 21d having a predetermined size, a circular perforations 22d, and a projection 24d, the circular perforations 22d outside of the mesh portion 2Id is positioned at a position of the perforations 22d of the disposable rubber sponge 20c. Further, in the case of the disposable rubber sponge 20℮, as shown in Fig. 9Ε, the disposable rubber sponge 20d includes a mesh portion 21℮ having a predetermined size, a circular perforations 22℮, and a projection 24℮, the circular perforations 22℮ outside of the mesh portion 2Id is positioned at a position of the perforations 22℮ of the disposable rubber sponge 20d. In Fig. 9D, the opening 27d formed on the outside of the perforations 22d is configured to expose the projection 24℮ to be described later of the rubber sponge 20℮. Fig. 10 is a diagram illustrating a state in which disposable rubber sponges 20a-20e are superimposed sequentially, for example, to be attached to the rubber sponge attachment portion 4 by a fastener 26. In this case, the disposable rubber sponge 20a is positioned at the distal end of the sponge rubber attachment portion 4, for example, and the disposable rubber sponge 20b, 20c, 20d, 20℮ are disposed sequentially underneath. Further, in Fig. 10, the opening 27a-27d are omitted to clarify structure of the perforations 22a-22e. iej :ore, in the oresent embodimr disposab. rubber: sponge 20a located at the top of the four rubber sponge attachment portions is first used, then a user who uses the poultice applicator catches and pull the projections 24a to separate the mesh portion 21a of the disposable rubber sponge 20a along the perforations 22a without removing the fastener 26, hence it is possible to use a new disposable rubber sponge 20b. In the same way, when the next user uses the poultice applicator, he catches the projections 24b of the disposable rubber sponge 2 0b to separate the mesh portion 21b of the disposable rubber sponge 20a along the perforations 22b, hence it is possible to use a new disposable rubber sponge 20c. By separating the mesh portion 21 along the perforations 22b using the projection 2 4 in the same manner, a new rubber sponge 20 is exposed, and it is possible to prevent from using a rubber sponge touched to the skin of another person, and from pausing on use of the poultice applicator. In particular, in the present embodiment, it is possible to apply a drug with a new disposable rubber sponge 20 without removing the fastener 26. Further, in the case of the present embodiment, because it uses a single fastener 26, it is possible to shorten the length of the four rubber sponge attachment portion 4, In the above embodiment, a structure is adopted in which the disposable rubber sponges 20a-20e are superimposed sequentially and are attached to the rubber sponge attachment portion 4 by the fastener 26, for example. However, it is possible that five disposable rubber sponges are attached to the fastener 26 by using an attachment means or the like, for example, so as to fasten to the tip of the poultice applicator 1. In this case, first the existing rubber sponge provided in the rubber sponge attachment portion 4 in advance is removed, and then the fastener 26 to which the disposable rubber sponges are attached. Further, the poultice applicator has the structure that uses five disposable rubber sponges 20a-20e in the above description of the embodiment. However, it is possible that a poultice applicator includes five or more disposable rubbersponges . Further, each of the disposable rubber sponges 20a-20e has the perforations. However, there is no need to have the perforations if it is possible the rubber sponges 20a-20e are cut along the outer periphery of the fastener 26. (Third Embodiment) Next, a third embodiment according to the present invention will be explained. The present embodiment discloses a poultice applicator that has a single fastener similar to the second embodiment, but has a disposable rubber sponge that has a different structure from that of the second embodiment. In the following, it will be explained in detail. Fig. 11Α is a diagram illustrating a disposable rubbersponge 30a used in the present embodiment. The disposable rubbersponge 30a includes a mesh portion 31a having a predetermined size at the middle, through which drug contained in the poultice applicator is exuded when the container is pressed. A slit 32a is formed at least a part of the mesh portion 31a. The slit 32a is formed in the diameter direction on the periphery of the mesh ρ ο r tiο η 31a, a s s hο wη iη Fig. 11A. Forexa mp1e, t he 1℮ ηgt h ο f the slit 32a is 1/5 to 1/10 of the diameter of the mesh portion 31a, and is formed to have a length that does not become the obstacle when applying drug due to its formation at the periphery. In addition, a skirt portion 33 shown in Fig. 11Α may be made of a sponge rubber. Similarly, Fig 11Β is a diagram illustrating a disposable rubber sponge 30b used in the present embodiment. The disposable rubber sponge mb . UQi a mesh portion 31b having a predetermined size at the middle, and a slit 32b is formed at least a part of the mesh portion 31b. The slit 32b, as shown in Fig. 11Β, is formed in the diameter direction on the periphery of the mesh portion 31b, and is formed at a position different from the disposable rubber sponge 30a. Specifically, the slit 32a formed at the mesh portion 32a of the rubber sponge 31a is formed at a position different from 180 degree with respect to Similarly, Fig. 11C is a diagram illustrating a disposable rubber sponge 30c used in the present embodiment. The disposable rubber sponge 30c includes a mesh portion 31b having a predetermined size at the middle, and a slit 32c is formed at least a part of the mesh portion 31c. The slit 32c, as shown in Fig. 11C, is also formed in the diameter direction on the periphery of the mesh portion 31c, and is formed at a position different from the disposable rubber sponge 30a. Specifically, the slit 32c formed at the mesh portion 31c of the rubber sponge 30c is formed at a position different from 90 degree with respect to cuts 31a and 31b of the mesh portions 32a and 32b. Similarly, Fig. 11D is a diagram illustrating a disposable rubber sponge 30ο used in the present embodiment. The disposable rubber sponge 30d includes a mesh portion 31b having a predetermined size at the middle, and a slit 32d is formed at least a part of the mesh portion 31d. The slit 32α, as shown in Fig. 11D, is also formed in the diameter direction on the periphery of the mesh portion 3Id, and is formed at a position different from the disposable rubber sponge 30a and the like. Specifically, the slit 32c formed at the mesh portion 32c of the rubber sponge 30c is formed at a position different from 180 degree with respect to cut 31c of the mesh portion 32c. Further, a disposable rubber sponge 30℮ includes a mesh portion 31℮ of a predetermined size as shown in Fig. HE, the mesh portion 31℮ has a slit 32℮ formed in a part of the mesh portion 31℮, and the position of the slit 32℮ of the mesh portion 31e is formed at the same position with the slit 32a formed in the mesh portion 32a of the disposable rubber sponge 31a. Fig. 12 is a diagram illustrating a state in which the disposable rubber sponges 30a-30e of the above configuration are superimposed sequentially to be attached to the rubber sponge attachment portion 4 by a fastener 34, for example. In this case, for example, the disposable rubber sponges 30a is positioned at the tip of the disposable rubber sponges 30a, and the disposable rubber sponge 3 Ob, 30c, 30d, 30℮ are disposed sequentially underneath. In this state, the disposable rubber sponge 3Qa located at the top of the four rubber sponges attachment portion is used first, then a user who uses the poultice applicator catches and pulls the projections 32a by their f ingers 35 to cut and separate the mesh portion 31a, hence it is possible to expose a underlying-mesh portion 31b. Further, the state shown in FIG 13, the finger 35 of one hand catches and pulls the slit 32a. However, it is possible to separate the mesh portion 31 easily by catching and pulling the both sides of the slit 32a with the fingers of the hands. Further, by forming the mesh portion 31a on the extension line of the slit 32a to be cut easily, mesh portion 31a can be exposed more certainly. For example, it may be possible that a rubber of the mesh portion 31a on the extension line of the slit 32a is configured to be It is possible that, in this way, the mesh portion 31a is cut and opened, and the mesh portion 31b of the unused (new) disposable rubber sponge 30b is exposed, hence it is possible to apply drug to the skin through the unused (new) disposable r ubb e r s ρ ο η g e 30 b. In the same manner, even when the next user uses the poultice applicator, it is possible that the mesh portion 31b may be cut and opened by using a slit 32b of the disposable rubber sponge 30 b and the next per scon uses a unused (new) disposable rubber sponge 30c, Further, the mesh parts 31a and 3Qb of the disposable rubber sponge 30a and 30b remain in the tip of the rubber sponge attachment portion 4. However, for example, by pulling a part of the mesh portions 31a, 31b that nave been cut and opened, the edge portion of the mesh portion 31a and 31b may be cut along the fastener 34 so that the remained mesh parts 31a and 30b may be separated. Further, as described in the second embodiment, perforations may be formed outside the mesh portion 32 to separate the remained mesh parts 31a and 30b easily. Therefore, it is possible to prevent from using- a rubbersponge touched to the skin of another person, and from pausing on use of the poultice applicator. In particular, in the present embodiment, it is possible to apply a drug with a new disposable rubber sponge 20 without removing the fastener 34. Furthermore, in the case of the present embodiment, because it uses a single fastener 26, it is possible to shorten the length of the four rubber sponge attachment portion 4. In the above embodiment, a structure is adopted in which the disposable rubber sponges 30β-30℮ are superimposed sequentially and are attached to the rubber sponge attachment portion 4 by the fastener 34, for example. However, it is possible that five disposable rubber sponges are attached to the fastener 34 by using an attachment means or the like, for example, so as to fasten to the tip of the poultice applicator 1. In this case, first the existing rubber sponge provided in the rubber sponge attachment portion 4 in advance is removed, and then the fastener 34 to which the disposable rubber sponges are attached. Further, the poultice applicator has the structure that uses five disposable rubber sponges 30a~30e in the above description of the embodiment. However, it is possible that a poultice applicator includes five or more disposable rubber (Fourth Embodiment) Next, a fourth embodiment according to the present invention will be explained. The present embodiment is intended to improve the fastener 26, 34 used in the second and third embodiments described above. In the following, In the following, it will be explained in detail. Fig. 14 is a diagram illustrating a structure of the fastener 37. The fastener 37 has the structure in which a part of the circular fastener 26, 34 is deleted, and the fastener 37 is made of metal, resin or the like. The length between the end portions 37a, 37b of the fastener 37 may be set shorter than the diameter of the rubber sponge attachment portion 4 described above, and the inner diameter of the fastener 37 is set narrower than the outer diameter of the rubber sponge attachment portion 4. Therefore, the disposable rubber sponges 20a-20e, 30a-30e are attached to the rubber sponge attachment portion 4, and the fastener 37 is engaged into the rubber sponge attachment portion 4, then the fastener 37 may be spread in a direction indicated by an arrow a in Fig, 14Α. Hence, the disposable rubber sponge is fitted to the rubber sponge attachment portion 4 by pressing force of the fastener 37. On the other hand, Fig. 14Β is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a fastener 38 of a modification of the present embodiment. The fastener 38 has a circular shape and is constituted by a member 38b 38a. Therefore, similar to the above mentioned case, the disposable rubber sponges 20a-20e, 30a-30e are attached to the rubber sponge attachment portion 4, and the fastener 37 is engaged into the rubber sponge attachment portion 4, then the disposable rubber sponge is fitted to the rubber sponge attachment portion 4 by pressing force of the fastener 38. (Fifth Embodiment) Next, a fifth embodiment according to the present invention will be explained. In this embodiment, in the basic structure of the poultice applicator 1 in which the analgesic and antiphlogistic poultice 2 is contained, that is, the poultice applicator 1 has the container in which the analgesic and antiphlogistic poultice 2 is contained and the rubber sponge attachment portion 4, antipruritic and anti-inflammatory poultice may be used insted of the analgesic and antiphlogistic poultice 2, as similar to the case of the first embodiment. The poultice applicator 1 according to this embodiment, a structure of the rubber sponge attachment portion 4 may be different from that in the previous embodiments. In the following, it will be explained in detail. Fig. 15 is a diagram illustrating a configuration of disposable rubber sponge that is used in this embodiment. As shown in Fig, 15, the disposable rubber sponge 14 of the present embodiment has a mesh structure covering the entire surface. For example, elastic member 15 such as a rubber-band is attached to four corners 14' of the disposable rubber sponge 14. Specifically, the elastic member 15 such as a rubber-band may be attached to the four corners 141 of the disposable rubber sponge 14, as shown in an arrow. Fig. 16 is a diagram illustrating the structure of a rubber sponge attachment portion 16 and illustrating a state in which no disposable rubber sponge is attached. As describer above, an existing rubber sponge 6 is attached to the tip of the rubber sponge attachment portion 16. In this embodiment, in order to use the elastic member 15 such as a rubber-band, grooves 17a, 17b,..,, are formed at regular intervals on the circumference of the rubber sponge attachment portion 16, and the elastic member 15 such as a rubber-band are engaged into the grooves 17a, 17b, .., , Fig. 17 is a diagram illustrating a state in which a first disposable rubber sponge 14a is attached to cover the existing disposable rubber sponge 6, that is, the elastic member 15 such as a rubber-band is engaged in the rubber sponge attachment portion 16. Although not shown, a second disposable rubber sponge 14b, a third disposable rubber sponge 14c, a third disposable rubber sponge 14c, ..., are attached to the rubber sponge attachment portion 16 sequentially, and each of the elastic members 15 such as rubber-bands may be engaged in the corresponding groove 17a, 17b, Therefore, when using the poultice applicator 1 of the present embodiment, for example, when the four disposable rubber sponges 14a-14d is attached to the poultice applicator 1, the first disposable rubber sponges 15d attached to the rubber sponge attachment portion 16 at the top level is used, and then a next user who uses the poultice applicator 1 removes the elastic member 15 such as rubber-band from the groove 17d to discard the disposable rubber sponge 14d, hence the next user may use a u ηus e d (ηe w) druq to the skin. disposable rubber sponge 14c to apply Similarly, the disposable rubber sponge 14c, 14b, 14a may be used sequentially, and it is possible to prevent from using a rubber sponge touched to the skin of another person, and from pausing on use of the poultice applicator. Further, the poultice applicator has the structure that uses four disposable rubber sponges 14a-14d in the above description of the embodiment. However, it may be possible that the poultice applicator 1 includes four or more disposable rubber sponges. It is possible that, for example, in travel or camping, it is not necessary to carry any rubber sponge for replacement due to such configuration of the poultice applicator 1, and it is possible to achieve the poultice applicator 1 that can be used by many users even if the only one poultice applicator 1 is carried. In the above, the first to fifth embodiments nave been described. All of the embodiments has the structure in which the rubber sponge attachment portion 4 is attached to the poultice applicator 1 and the disposable rubber sponge is attached to the rubber sponge attachment portion 4 . In the poultice applicator 1, it is not limited to use the sponge, and cloth, resin or the like can be used instead of the sponge. In this case, for example, synthetic rubber and natural rubber is attached to the rubber sponge mounting portion 4 as the disposable rubber sponge. The synthetic rubber is exemplified as ethylene-propylene rubber and chloroprene rubber, silicone rubber, etc. Further, when using a cloth, for example, the rubber sponge attachment portion 4 may be the name of a disposable cloth attachment portion. For example, synthetic fibers or natural materials such as cotton, silk, hemp, etc., and a woven fabric as the fabric material can be used without being limited to η ο η w ο ν e η f a b r i c. Further, when using a cloth, depending on the weave, it is possible that no mesh portion can also be provided Fc example, if the required drug- is applied without providing a mesh portion, it is not necessary to provide the mesh portion. It is not limited the rubber sponge attachment portion 4 uses not only thermoplastic resins such as polyamide and polyethylene but also thermosetting resins such as epoxy resin οr ρheηο 1 i c re s iη.
