Description: Water control device and adaptation of conventional hydro-pot for hydroponic systems This invention relates to a device to control the water/feed level within a hydroponic gardening system, incorporating adaptations of existing systems to aid the grower. Traditionally flowers, plants, fruit and vegetables have grown in soil and composts. In recent times the ability to grow in a variety of different mediums has been made possible via science, including the ability to grow plants submersed in water when essential nutrients are added. Although the use of such systems is not widely embraced at present, the use of hydroponic growing is on the rise. However, the ability to control and ensure the continuous watering of plants/ fruits etc grown in such systems unfortunately does not currently exist in current hydro-pot systems. This prevents the ability to be absent from crops long periods of time. Unlike soil which is full of nutrients, hydroponically grown plants and vegetables need feed/ nutrients added to water, therefore it is not just a case of linking up a tap on a timer, drip feed or reservoir systems incorporating simple ball cock valves. The invention in figure 1 quite simply address's this issue. The control device in figure 1 automates the system allows the grower to be absent for long periods of time dependant on the size of the reservoirs attached to the invention. The control device can also be retro fitted to conventional hydro growing pots, or adaptations described below. The invention is an electrically powered waterproof device. Power sources can vary from solar, battery and mains making these devices usable both indoors and outdoors with the correct apparatus. A combination of existing components is what allows this invention to work. The components have been around for some time but combining existing components and arranging them to perform certain tasks for the hydroponic growing system makes this invention unique. The invention including adaptations will now be described solely by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: Figure 1 shows "The Control Unit", an 1Ρ67 rated (waterproof) plastic box(l). Enclosed within this box are two main components a voltage AC/DC convertor(4), and relay switch(5). Items (6)(7)(8) are 1Ρ67 (waterproof) connectors for the power supply, float switch (2), and pump (11) which enable the device to function as required. Figure 2 "The control pot" incorporates a control unit (figure 1) and is to be used in-conjunction with multiple hydro-pot systems (figure 2a). It acts as a central control point, which can control many grow pots over large levelled areas. The pot fills up by pumping water from the reservoir via the inlet(B), see figure 2a. Figure 3- Is a variation of the control pot called an "easypot". Difference to the control pot, it incorporates a net pot (10) for plants to grow in. It also includes a protective guard (9) which surrounds the float switch and prevent roots tangling around the switch. This invention is used in confined spaces and for small hobby gardeners. Figure 1- Control Unit The way the unit works is the power enters the control unit from source eg, mains and then converted to 12ν via the voltage convertor, 12ν runs through to the switch which when activated signalling the pump to turn on. The pump when activated by the float switch fills up the easy pot (figure 3) or control Pot (figure 2) with water/feed stored in a reservoir/ tank which in-turn fills the pot to the desired level as set by the user, usually positioned at the height suggested in figure 3 in-line with the base of the net pot. When the desired level is reached the float switch turns off the pump. The control unit can also be retrofitted to an existing system a grower may have built themselves or just a conventional hydro growing pot. Figure 2- Control Pot The control pot simply controls the level of the water of multiple pots attached, achieved by setting the float switch at a level in-line with the base of the net pots installed in the adjoining grow pot/s. The control pot has no net pot or ability to grow anything in it. This prevents roots getting tangled with the float switch, therefore enabling the switch to read the water level accurately. Figure (1) the control unit, is attached to the side of the control pot (figure 2) with water proof fittings. The float switch determines the need for water/feed as it falls which activates the pump which fills the control pot with feed from the reservoir to its set level. A series of grow pots (see figure 2a) can be linked using hose and hose fittings', the water level is still controlled by the "control pot". Once water/feed reaches the required level in all pots attached the switch will deactivate pump until levels reduce. Figure 3- Easy pot Working in the same way as the control pot, controlling the water/feed level via the control unit the difference is the float switch is surrounded by a protective guard (9). The guard allows water to pass through it but prevents root systems of plants penetrating the guard. This prevents accidently triggering the switch, maintaining the correct feed/water level, therefore allowing the plant/ fruit etc to actually grow in the pot via use of a net pot (10) and suitable growing medium such a clay pebbles, the medium is needed to ensure stable growing is achieved. This system can be used in confined spaces where only one or two pots are needed or space does not allow for a control pot. Other hydro-pots can also be added, their feed levels again controlled by the primary "easypot" see figure 3a. 1. A waterproof device to control water/ feed levels attached to a control pot which has no ability for a plant to grow in or easy pot which has the ability to allow plant growth and incorporates preventative measures against root intervention.Alternatively, the device can be retro fitted to other existing designs of hydro plant pots. The device maintains the water/ feed level desired at all times by pumping extra water/feed as required from an external reservoir. The device is powered by electricity. 2.
