Botanical designation: Dahlia hybrida. Cultivar denomination: ‘HDCHR23’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Dahlia plant, botanically known as Dahlia hybrida, and hereinafter referred to by the name ‘HDCHR23’. The new Dahlia plant is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in Lisse, The Netherlands. The objective of the breeding program is to create new compact container Dahlia plants with dark-colored leaves, large inflorescences and good postproduction longevity. The new Dahlia plant originated from an open-pollination in Lisse, The Netherlands in 2008 of a proprietary seedling selection of Dahlia hybrida identified as code number VR7-205, not patented, as the female, or seed, parent with a proprietary selection of Dahlia hybrida identified as code number VD5-272, not patented, as the male, or pollen, parent. The new Dahlia plant was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant from within the progeny of the stated open-pollination in a controlled greenhouse environment in Lisse, The Netherlands in 2009. Asexual reproduction of the new Dahlia plant by terminal vegetative cuttings since the spring of 2010 in a controlled greenhouse environment in Lisse, The Netherlands, has shown that the unique features of this new Dahlia plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Plants of the new Dahlia have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions and cultural practices. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environmental conditions such as temperature and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘HDCHR23’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘HDCHR23’ as a new and distinct Dahlia plant: 1. Compact, mounding and dense plant habit.2. Serrated dark-colored leaves.3. Freely flowering habit.4. Daisy-type inflorescence form.5. Large inflorescences with red purple-colored ray florets.6. Good postproduction longevity. Plants of the new Dahlia differ primarily from plants of the female parent selection in the following characteristics: 1. Plants of the new Dahlia are more compact and denser than plants of the female parent selection.2. Leaves of plants of the new Dahlia are darker in color than leaves of plants of the female parent selection.3. Plants of the new Dahlia and the female parent selection differ in ray floret color as plants of the female parent selection have reddish brown-colored ray florets. Plants of the new Dahlia differ primarily from plants of the male parent selection in the following characteristics: 1. Plants of the new Dahlia are more compact and denser than plants of the male parent selection.2. Plants of the new Dahlia are more freely branching than plants of the male parent selection.3. Leaves of plants of the new Dahlia are darker in color than leaves of plants of the male parent selection.4. Plants of the new Dahlia have smaller inflorescences than plants of the male parent selection.5. Plants of the new Dahlia and the male parent selection differ in ray floret color as plants of the male parent selection have red-colored ray florets. Plants of the new Dahlia can be compared to plants of the Dahlia hybrida ‘HDPU165’, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 23,299. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Lisse, The Netherlands, plants of the new Dahlia differed from plants of ‘HDPU165’ in the following characteristics: 1. Plants of the new Dahlia were more compact than plants of ‘HDPU165’.2. Plants of the new Dahlia had larger leaves than plants of ‘HDPU165’.3. Plants of the new Dahlia and ‘HDPU165’ differed in ray and disc floret color.4. Plants of the new Dahlia had longer peduncles than plants of ‘HDPU165’. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS The accompanying photographs illustrate the overall appearance of the new Dahlia plant showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photographs may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describe the colors of the new Dahlia plant. The photograph on the first sheet comprises a side perspective view of typical flowering plants of ‘HDCHR23’ grown in an outdoor nursery. The photograph on the second sheet is a close-up view of a typical flowering plant of ‘HDCHR23’. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The photographs and following observations and measurements describe plants grown during the late summer and early autumn in 15-cm containers in an outdoor nursery in Lisse, The Netherlands and under cultural practices typical of commercial container Dahlia production. During the production of the plants, day temperatures ranged from 15° C. to 30° C. and night temperatures ranged from 10° C. to 20° C. Plants were pinched one time about three weeks after planting. Plants were four months old when the photographs and description were taken. In the following description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, 1995 Edition, except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
