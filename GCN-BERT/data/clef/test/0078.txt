4"-0-SUBSTITUTED TYLOSIN A DERIVATIVES CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/951,179 filed March 11, 2014 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/052,626 filed September 19, 2014, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT [0002] Not applicable. TECHNICAL FIELD [0003] The present invention relates to derivatives of tylosin A, compositions comprising such derivatives, and methods of treating or preventing conditions or disorders using such derivatives and compositions. BACKGROUND [0004] Tylosin A (2-((4R,5S,6S,7R,9R,l lE,13E,15R,16R)-6-(((2R,3R,4R,5S,6R)-5- (((2S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5-dihydroxy-4,6-dimethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)-4-(dimethylamino)-3- hydroxy-6-methyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)- 16-ethyl-4-hydroxy- 15-((((2R,3R,4R,5R,6R)-5- hydroxy-3 ,4-dimethoxy-6-methyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)methyl)-5 ,9, 13-trimethyl-2, 10- dioxooxacyclohexadeca-1 l,13-dien-7-yl)acetaldehyde) is a macro lide antibiotic that is commonly used to treat veterinary infections. Tylosin A has a broad range of activity against Gram-positive organisms, with activity against a few Gram-negative species. Its high safety margin has led to its non-selective use as a food additive in meat production, and as a growth promoting agent. However, tylosin A and its derivatives have seen only limited use in companion animal health care. Tylvalosin, a derivative of tylosin, is available commercially as Aivlosin®. Aivlosin® is used for treating bacterial infections in farm animals. Neither tylosin A nor its derivatives are approved for use in human disease. [0005] In part, the use of tylosin A and its analogs has been limited by their marginal pharmacokinetic profiles. Tylosin A has a relatively short half-life in vivo, and is poorly absorbed from an oral dose. The oral bioavailability of tylosin A in mammals is low. Thus, a tylosin A analog or derivative with improved pharmacokinetic properties would be a valuable addition to the treatment options for human and veterinary infections. [0006] The mycarosyl group of Tylosin A can be cleaved to form desmycarosyl tylosin or tylosin B. Several groups have reported tylosin B analogs or derivatives with improved pharmacokinetic properties. Narandja et al. (J. Antibiotics 1995, 248) reported a derivative of tylosin B that gives tissue drug levels 2-3 times those of the parent. The commercial antibiotic tilmicosin (EL-870) is a semi-synthetic derivative of tylosin B and has been demonstrated to have a superior drug level profile when compared with the parent compound (Ose, E.E., J. Antibiotics 1987, 190). Tilmicosin is commercially available for prevention and treatment of bovine and ovine respiratory diseases associated with bacterial infection. [0007] One particular challenge for the development of orally-bioavailable tylosin A derivatives is the susceptibility of tylosin esters (especially those derivatized at the 4"-position on the mycarose sugar) to hepatic esterases, as noted by Takeuchi et al. (J. Antibiotics 1987, 1358). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0008] The present invention pertains to derivatives and analogs of tylosin A. In particular, the present invention pertains to compounds having a structure of Formula (I): and salts thereof, wherein: [0009] Ri represents hydrogen or— C(0)R3, wherein R3 represents an optionally substituted Ci-C6-alkyl or Ci-C6-haloalkyl; [0010] R2 represents— C(0)C(R4)(R5)(R6), wherein each of R4, R5, and 5 are independently selected from the group consisting of Ci-C6-alkyl, Ci-C6-haloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, C3-C8- cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, arylalkyl, heteroarylalkyl, and C3-C8-cycloalkyl-Ci-C4-alkyl; or [0011] R2 represents— C(0)N(R7)(R8), wherein each of R7 and R8 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, Ci-C6-alkyl, Ci-C6-haloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, C3-C8- cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, arylalkyl, heteroarylalkyl, and C3-C8-cycloalkyl-Ci-C4-alkyl, or R7 and R8 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form an optionally substituted saturated or partially saturated heterocyclic ring; or [0012] R2 represents— CH2-Al s wherein A\ represents a 6- to 10-membered aryl or a 5- to 10- membered heteroaryl and Ai is unsubstituted or substituted with one or more RA, wherein each RA is independently selected from the group consisting of halogen, Ci-C6-alkyl, and Ci-C6-haloalkyl; [0013] Rg represents hydrogen or ~C(0)Rio, wherein R10 represents an optionally substituted Ci-C6-alkyl or Ci-C6-haloalkyl; [0014] each of a and b independently represents either a single bond or a double bond; [0015] with the proviso that when both a and b are a double bond and Ri and R are both hydrogen, A\ is not unsubstituted phenyl; and [0016] with the proviso that when both a and b are a double bond and Ri and R9 are both hydrogen or both C(0)CH3, neither R7 nor Rg is hydrogen. [0017] The present application discloses a general strategy for the preparation of tylosin A derivatives or analogs. In certain embodiments, the tylosin A derivatives or analogs have antibiotic activity and pharmacokinetic properties suitable for oral dosing. In certain embodiments, the tylosin A derivatives or analogs are modified at the 4"-hydroxyl group with an esterase-resistant substituent. In certain embodiments, such derivatives or analogs retain antibiotic activity, but demonstrate improved absorption and longer in vivo half-lives. In certain embodiments, these 4"- substituted tylosin A derivatives or analogs are, optionally, further modified through acylation of the 2'-hydroxyl. Thus, in certain embodiments, the resultant compounds have significantly improved pharmacokinetic properties, consistent with oral dosing, while retaining potent antibiotic activity against Gram-positive and some Gram-negative organisms. [0018] Another aspect of the present invention pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.

In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is suitable for human use. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is suitable for veterinary use. In certain embodiments, such pharmaceutical compositions are used for the treatment or prevention of bacterial infection in a human. In certain embodiments, such pharmaceutical compositions are used for the treatment or prevention of bacterial infection in domesticated or semi-domesticated animals, such as poultry, honeybees, cows, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, mice and the like. [0019] Another aspect of the present invention pertains to the use of compounds of Formula (I) to treat or prevent a bacterial infection in a mammal. Compounds of Formula (I) exert antibacterial activity against various mammalian pathogens, including Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococi, Enterococci and Streptococi.

[00325] In one aspect, the present compounds include 4 "-substituted tylosin A analogs and derivatives. In certain embodiments, the present compounds include 2 '-substituted and 4"- substituted tylosin A analogs and derivatives. In certain embodiments, such analogs retain antibiotic activity, but demonstrate improved absorption and longer in vivo half-lives. Thus, in certain embodiments, the resultant compounds have pharmacokinetic properties consistent with oral dosing, while retaining potent antibiotic activity against gram-positive and some gram-negative organisms. [00326] In certain embodiments, the present compounds include tylosin A analogs and derivatives having a 4"-0-halobenzyl or 4"-0-dihalobenzyl moiety. In certain embodiments, the present compounds include tylosin A analogs and derivatives having a 4"-0-dimethylpropionyl moiety. In certain embodiments, the present compounds include tylosin A analogs and derivatives having a 4"-0-dialkylcarbamoyl, 4"-0-dicycloalkylcarbamoyl, or 4"-morpholine-4-carboxylate moiety. [00327] As noted by Takeuchi et al. (J. Antibiotics 1987, 1358), esters of the 4"-OH group tend to be highly unstable in vivo, a result of hydrolysis due to the action of putative hepatic esterases. This metabolic event creates a challenge for achieving useful circulating levels of active drug. [00328] In one aspect, the present compounds include tylosin A analogs and derivatives having a stable 4"-ester moiety. In certain embodiments, the stable 4"-ester moiety includes three non-hydrogen substituents at the alpha-position of the ester. In other embodiments, the stable 4"- ester moiety includes a nitrogen atom having two non-hydrogen substituents. For example, in certain embodiments, the nitrogen atom is disubstituted to form a disubstituted carbamate. [00329] In certain embodiments, the present compounds include tylosin A analogs and derivatives having a carbamate at the 4" position. In certain embodiments, the 4"-carbamate lacks a hydrogen bond donor. In certain embodiments, the nitrogen atom of the carbamate has two non- hydrogen substituents. [00330] In certain embodiments, the present compounds include tylosin A analogs and derivatives having a disubstituted carbamate at the 4" position. In certain embodiments, a disubstituted carbamoyl chloride, such as a dialkylcarbamoyl chloride, is used to produce a compound having a disubstituted carbamate at the 4" position; the success of such a reaction scheme was not predictable prior to the present disclosure. Appropriate methods and reagents for preparing a tylosin A analog or derivative having a disubstituted carbamate at the 4" position are identified throughout the present disclosure. [00331] In one aspect, the present compounds include 2 '-substituted tylosin A analogs and derivatives. In certain embodiments, the present compounds include tylosin A analogs and derivatives having a 2'-0-acyl moiety. In certain embodiments, the present compounds include tylosin A analogs and derivatives having a 2'-0-acetyl moiety. In certain embodiments, the present compounds include tylosin A analogs and derivatives having a 2'-0-propionyl moiety. In certain embodiments, the present compounds include tylosin A analogs and derivatives having a 2'-0- methylpropionyl moiety. [00332] It is to be understood that compounds disclosed herein may exhibit the stereoisomerism, including geometric isomerism, and/or tautomerism. [00333] For example, the present compounds may exist as stereoisomers where asymmetric or chiral centers are present. These stereoisomers are "R" or "S" depending on the configuration of substituents around the chiral carbon atom. The terms "R" and "S" used herein are configurations as defined in IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E, Fundamental Stereochemistry, Pure Appl. Chem., 1976, 45: 13-30. [00334] The present disclosure contemplates various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof and these are specifically included within the scope of the invention. Stereoisomers include enantiomers and diastereomers, and mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers. Individual stereoisomers of the present compounds may be prepared synthetically from commercially available starting materials which contain asymmetric or chiral centers or by preparation of racemic mixtures followed by resolution. [00335] The present disclosure also contemplates various geometric isomers and mixtures thereof resulting from the disposition of substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond, a carbon- nitrogen double bond, a cycloalkyl group, or a heterocycle group. [00336] The present disclosure also contemplates various tautomers and mixtures thereof resulting from, for example, interconversion between keto and enol forms. [00337] Thus, the formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric or stereoisomeric forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric or stereoisomeric form, and mixtures thereof, and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric or stereoisomeric form utilized within the naming of the compounds or formulae drawings. [00338] The present disclosure also contemplates isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in Formula (I), Formula (II), Formula (III), Formula (IV), Formula (V), Formula (VI), Formula (VII), Formula (VIII), or Formula (IX) but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in such isotopically-labeled compounds are hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine, and chlorine, such as, but not limited to 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 180, 170, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36C1, respectively. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half- life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Compounds incorporating positron-emitting isotopes are useful in medical imaging and positron- emitting tomography (PET) studies for determining the distribution of receptors. Suitable positron- emitting isotopes that can be incorporated in compounds of Formula (I), Formula (II), Formula (III), Formula (IV), Formula (V), Formula (VI), Formula (VII), Formula (VIII), or Formula (IX) are nC, 13 N, 15 O, and 18 F. Isotopically-labeled compounds of Formula (I), Formula (II), Formula (III), Formula (IV), Formula (V), Formula (VI), Formula (VII), Formula (VIII), or Formula (IX) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Schemes and Examples using appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of non-isotopically-labeled reagent. [00339] C. METHODS FOR PREPARING COMPOUNDS [00340] The present compounds can be better understood in connection with the following synthetic schemes and methods which illustrate a means by which the compounds can be prepared. [00341] The present compounds may be prepared from Tylosin A as described below. [00342] As indicated in Scheme 1, Tylosin A (or a salt thereof) is selectively acylated at the 2'-hydroxyl using an acylating agent such as an acid anhydride or the like, in a solvent such as acetone or chloroform or ethanol or the like. Alternatively, the acylating agent may be generated in situ, using a carboxylic acid and an activating agent such as isobutyl chloformate or the like, optionally in the presence of a base such as N-methylmorpholine or the like. SCHEME 1 [00343] The resultant 2'-ester may be converted to the corresponding 3"/4"-cyclic tin reagent through reaction with dibutyltin oxide, or dibutyltin dichloride, or the like, optionally in the presence of a base such as 1,2,2, 6,6, -pentamethylpiperidine or the like, in a solvent such as toluene or THF or the like. As indicated in Scheme 2, the resultant tin reagent is not generally isolated, but is reacted directly [00344] a) with an acylating agent, such as an acid chloride or the like, to give the corresponding 4"-acylated analog; [00345] b) with a carbamylating agent, such diethylcarbamyl chloride or ethyl isocyanate or the like, to give the corresponding 4 "-carbamate analog; or [00346] c) with a benzylating agent, for example 4-fluorobenzyl brominde or the like, optionally in the presence of an iodide source such as tetra-n-butylammonium iodide or the like, to give the corresponding 4"-benzylated analog. [00347] In the specific case where the 2'-substituent is acetyl, the resultant 2'-OAc/4"- substituted analog may (as in Scheme 3) be warmed in an alcohol like methanol or the like, optionally in the presence of a catalyst like solid sodium bicarbonate or the like, to hydro lyze the 2'- ester, resulting in the production of a 2'-unsubstituted, 4 "-substituted analog. SCHEME 3 [00348] To prepare compounds that are simultaneously modified at the 2 ' , 4 " , and 4 " ' positions, a 274"-derivatized intermediate (prepared as described in Scheme 2) is treated with an acylating agent like acetic anhydride, or propionic anhydride, or the like, in a basic solvent like pyridine or lutidine or the like, as shown in Scheme 4. In the specific case where the 2'-substituent is acetyl, the resultant 2'-OAc/4"/4" '-substituted analog may be warmed in an alcohol like methanol or the like, optionally in the presence of a catalyst like solid sodium bicarbonate or the like, to hydro lyze the 2 '-ester, resulting in the production of a 2'-unsubstituted, 4"/4" '-disubstituted analog. SCHEME 4 [00349] To prepare compounds that are reduced at the 10/11 and/or 12/13 positions, the corresponding unsaturated compound may be treated with hydrogen gas, or a hydrogen source like ammonium formate or the like, in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst like palladium-on-carbon or platinum-on-carbon or Raney nickel or the like, in a solvent like ethanol or ethyl acetate or the like. By controlling the time, temperature, solvent and concentration of the reaction, one or both of th 10/11 and 12/13 double bonds may be reduced to single bonds. [00350] The present compounds and intermediates may be isolated and purified by conventional methods in the field of organic synthesis. Examples of conventional methods for isolating and purifying compounds can include, but are not limited to, chromatography on solid supports such as silica gel, alumina, or silica derivatized with alkylsilane groups, by recrystallization at high or low temperature with an optional pretreatment with activated carbon, thin-layer chromatography, distillation at various pressures, sublimation under vacuum, and trituration, as described for instance in "Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry", 5th edition (1989), by Furniss, Hannaford, Smith, and Tatchell, pub. Longman Scientific & Technical, Essex CM20 2JE, England. [00351] The present compounds have at least one basic nitrogen whereby the compound can be treated with an acid to form a desired salt. For example, a compound may be reacted with an acid at or above room temperature to provide the desired salt, which is deposited, and collected by filtration after cooling. Examples of acids suitable for the reaction include, but are not limited to tartaric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, as well as mandelic, atrolactic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, carbonic, fumaric, maleic, gluconic, acetic, propionic, salicylic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulfuric, citric, hydroxybutyric, camphorsulfonic, malic, phenylacetic, aspartic, or glutamic acid, and the like. In certain embodiments, a compound may be reacted with a weak acid to provide the desired salt. Examples of suitable weak acids, but are not limited to, tartaric acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, citric acid, malic acid, and the like. In certain embodiments, the acid is tartaric acid. [00352] Optimum reaction conditions and reaction times for each individual step can vary depending on the particular reactants employed and substituents present in the reactants used. Unless otherwise specified, solvents, temperatures and other reaction conditions can be readily selected. Specific procedures are provided in the Examples section. Reactions can be worked up in the conventional manner, e.g. by eliminating the solvent from the residue and further purified according to methodologies generally known in the art such as, but not limited to, crystallization, distillation, extraction, trituration and chromatography. Unless otherwise described, the starting materials and reagents are either commercially available or can be prepared by one skilled in the art from commercially available materials using methods described in the chemical literature. [00353] Routine experimentations, including appropriate manipulation of the reaction conditions, reagents and sequence of the synthetic route, protection of any chemical functionality that is not compatible with the reaction conditions, and deprotection at a suitable point in the reaction sequence of the method are included in the scope of the invention. Suitable protecting groups and the methods for protecting and deprotecting different substituents using such suitable protecting groups are well known; examples of which can be found in PGM Wuts and TW Greene, Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (4th ed.), John Wiley & Sons, NY (2006), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Synthesis of the present compounds can be accomplished by methods analogous to those described in the synthetic schemes described hereinabove and in specific examples. [00354] Starting materials, if not commercially available, can be prepared by procedures selected from standard organic chemical techniques, techniques that are analogous to the synthesis of known, structurally similar compounds, or techniques that are analogous to the above described schemes or the procedures described in the synthetic examples section. [00355] When an optically active form of a compound is required, it can be obtained by carrying out one of the procedures described herein using an optically active starting material (prepared, for example, by asymmetric induction of a suitable reaction step), or by resolution of a mixture of the stereoisomers of the compound or intermediates using a standard procedure (such as chromatographic separation, recrystallization or enzymatic resolution). [00356] Similarly, when a pure geometric isomer of a compound is required, it can be obtained by carrying out one of the above procedures using a pure geometric isomer as a starting material, or by resolution of a mixture of the geometric isomers of the compound or intermediates using a standard procedure such as chromatographic separation. [00357] It can be appreciated that the synthetic schemes and specific examples as illustrated in the Examples section are illustrative and are not to be read as limiting the scope of the invention as it is defined in the appended claims. All alternatives, modifications, and equivalents of the synthetic methods and specific examples are included within the scope of the claims. [00358] D.

[00507] Compounds were characterized by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC- MS) analysis: [00508] Analytical LC-MS was performed on a Finnigan Navigator mass spectrometer and Agilent 1100 HPLC system running Xcalibur 1.2, Open-Access 1.3, and custom login software. The mass spectrometer was operated under positive APCI ionization conditions. The HPLC system comprised an Agilent Quaternary pump, degasser, column compartment, autosampler and diode- array detector, with a Polymer Labs ELS-2100 evaporative light-scattering detector.

[00511] Compounds were dosed orally to Sprague-Dawley rats, using appropriate formulations and doses. Serial blood samples were collected at selected time points post-dosing. Plasma was separated from the blood by centrifugation. 25 of plasma (sample, standard or QC) was combined with 25 of internal standard and 250 acetonitrile. Following vortexing to mix, the plates were centrifuged to separate the precipitated proteins. A 50 aliquot of the supemantant was transferred to a clean 96-well plate and diluted with 100 μΐ, 0.1% formic acid. Stock standards were prepared in DMSO, with intermediate dilutions in acetonitrile: water (50:50, by volume). Samples were analyzed by LC-MS. The drug level curves were used to calculate dose-normalized area under the curve (AUC/D) data, which are reported as μg-hr/mL per mg/kg. [00512] Table 3. Pharmacokinetic Properties of Example compounds (AUC/D, μg-hr/mL per mg/kg) Compound 8 0.51 Compound 10 0.0165 Compound 13 0.183 Compound 14 0.057 Compound 18 0.42 Compound 19 0.04 Compound 38 0.065 [00513] Pharmacokinetic properties of compounds having three non-hydrogen substituents at the alpha-position of the ester (i.e., a tri-substituted ester) were further examined. A compound having a 4"-tri-substituted ester moiety (Compound 14) was compared to a di-substituted control compound. The compounds were dosed orally, 20 mg/kg, in rats. [00514] Table 4 shows percentages of parent and metabolite (here, "metabolite" refers specifically to the 4"-deacylated metabolite) compound following oral dosing. Parent-vs-Metabolite percentages are determined based on AUC(0-∞), which is calculated from 10 plasma samples collected over 12 hours. [00515] Table 4. Comparison of parent vs. metabolite levels [00516] As indicated in Table 4, dosing of the control compound produces no circulating parent drug, but only the 4"-deacylated metabolite. In contrast, when the tri-substituted variant is dosed, the primary circulating material is the parent. Thus, the tri-substituted 4"-esters are pharmacokinetically distinct from and superior to di-substituted analogs. Table 4 demonstrates the beneficial effect of three non-hydrogen substituents at the alpha-position of the ester (i.e., a tri- substituted ester) on metabolic stability. [00517] Pharmacokinetic properties of compounds having a 4"-benzyl moiety were further examined. A compound having a 4"-halobenzyl moiety (Compound 10) was compared to a compound having an unsubstituted 4"-benzyl moiety. The compounds were dosed orally, 20 mg/kg, in rats. [00518] Table 5 shows percentages of parent and metabolite (here, "metabolite" refers specifically to the 4"-debenzylated metabolite) compound following oral dosing. Parent-vs- Metabolite percentages are determined based on AUC(0-∞), which is calculated from 10 plasma samples collected over 12 hours. [00519] Table 5. Comparison of parent vs. metabolite levels [00520] Table 5 shows that an unsubstituted 4"-benzyl group is metabolically labile; without wishing to be bound by theory, the action of cytochrome-P450-mediated oxidative metabolism may contribute to the metabolism of an unsubstituted 4"-benzyl group. In particular, as indicated in Table 5, a 4"-debenzylated metabolite was observed in pharmacokinetic studies of compounds having an unsubstituted 4"-benzyl moiety. In contrast, a compound having a 4"-halogenated benzyl moiety yields negligible amounts of the 4"-debenzylated metabolite. [00521] Placement of certain substituents, such as halogen groups, on the aromatic ring of the 4"-benzyl group, suppresses the production of a de-benzylated metabolite. Thus, the substituted 4"- benzyl ethers disclosed herein, and, in particular, the 4"-halobenzyl ethers, are pharmacokinetically distinct from and superior to previously reported analogs. Table 5 demonstrates the beneficial effect of the 4"-halobenzyl ethers and, in particular, the 4"-fluorobenzyl ethers, on stability. [00522] Testing for Antibiotic Activity - Agar Disc Diffusion Method [00523] Antibacterial tests were performed on a series of tylosin A derivatives via the 'agar disc diffusion' assay. This assay is employed to determine the sensitivity of pathogens to chemical entities under investigation and is a standardized procedure outlined in 1961 by the World Health Organization. [00524] Bacteria tested were a standard gram positive organism; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (available from the American Type Culture Collection). [00525] Colonies of bacteria are dispensed into liquid Mueller-Hinton II broth (available from Becton, Dickinson and Company), agitated and then streaked onto prepared Mueller-Hinton agar plates. Bacteria were allowed to grow for 16 hours at 37 degrees C. A sterile loupe was used to select 4-5 isolates from the cultures thus grown, and dispensed into Mueller-Hinton broth. Inoculated broth was then diluted further with fresh Mueller-Hinton II broth until a McFarland Standard (test kit available from Scientific Device Laboratory) concentration of 0.5 on the McFarland scale was achieved. [00526] Once a McFarland standard inoculum was achieved, this stock was plated via sterile swabs onto a Mueller-Hinton II agar plate (available from Teknova), which has been stored at 4°C and is first allowed to achieve room temperature, streaking the entire plate 3 times, and rotated 120 degrees around between inoculations. [00527] Each tylosin A derivative was obtained as ImM stock solution in DMSO. For each compound, 10 (10 nanomoles) was dispensed onto a 7mm blank paper disc (available from BBL, Le Pont du Claire, France), replicates of each was thus prepared, and allowed to dry for 16 hours. [00528] Gentamicin was used as the antibacterial standard, as it demonstrates activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Pre-dispensed 7mm paper discs containing 10 μg of gentamicin are used (available from Becton, Dickinson and Company) and one disc was placed on each test plate of tylosin A derivatives. [00529] To obtain a dose response curve against Staphylococcus aureus, 20 μΐ, (20 nanomoles) of each tylosin A derivative to be tested as obtained from the company compound repository at ImM stock solution in DMSO was dispensed onto a 7mm blank paper disc. After drying overnight, the 7mm compound infused paper discs were placed at ~30cm intervals upon agar plates freshly streaked with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. Inoculated and disc dispensed plates so prepared were allowed to grow for 16 hours at 37°C. At this time, the 'zone of inhibition' around each 7mm paper disc (inclusive of the disc itself) was measured and recorded in Table 6 below. [00530] Table 6.

[00533] Minimum inhibitory concentration ("MIC") values for the isolates were determined using a broth microdilution method. The wells of a standard 96-well microdilution plate (Costar 3795, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were filled with 150 μΙ_, of an appropriate diluent. For test compounds supplied as powders, Column 1 was filled with 300 μΙ_, of either the investigational or comparator agents at the appropriate stock concentration (40X the highest test concentration). A Biomek 200 was used to make eleven 2-fold serial dilutions to create a "mother plate". For compounds supplied as DMSO stocks, compounds were diluted to 50X the highest test concentrations and 2-fold serial dilutions were made manually. [00534] For compounds supplied as solids, "daughter plates" were loaded with 185 μΙ_, using the Multidrop 384. These daughter plates were prepared on the Biomek F/X instrument which transferred 5 of drug solution from each well of the mother plate to each corresponding well of each daughter plate in a single step. For compounds supplied as DMSO stock, daughter plates were filled with 90 μΙ_, of media and 2 μΙ_, of drug solution from each well of the mother plate was added to each corresponding well manually. [00535] A suspension of standardized inoculum for each organism, equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard, was diluted 1 : 10 in Mueller Hinton II broth resulting in a final concentration of approximately 5 x 105 CFU/mL during testing. Inocula were transferred to compartments of sterile reservoirs divided by length. The Biomek 2000 was used to inoculate all plates. Daughter plates were placed on the Biomek 2000 in reverse orientation so that plates were inoculated from low to high drug concentration. The Biomek 2000 delivered 10 μΐ^ οΐ standardized inoculum into each well of the appropriate daughter plate. The final concentration of DMSO (if used as a solvent) in the test wells was 2.5%. [00536] Plates were stacked 3 high, covered with a lid on the top plate, placed into plastic bags, and incubated at 35°C for approximately 20 hours. An un-inoculated solubility control plate was observed for evidence of drug precipitation. MIC values were read where visible growth of the organism was inhibited. [00537] Table 7.
