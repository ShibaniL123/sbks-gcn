CROSS REFERENCE This application is the National Stage Application of International Patent Application No. PCT/IB2011/052840, filed Jun. 28, 2011, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/362,904, filed on Jul. 9, 2010. The invention relates to sulfonamide derivatives, to their use in medicine, to compositions containing them, to processes for their preparation and to intermediates used in such processes. Voltage-gated sodium channels are found in all excitable cells including myocytes of muscle and neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system. In neuronal cells, sodium channels are primarily responsible for generating the rapid upstroke of the action potential. In this manner sodium channels are essential to the initiation and propagation of electrical signals in the nervous system. Proper and appropriate function of sodium channels is therefore necessary for normal function of the neuron. Consequently, aberrant sodium channel function is thought to underlie a variety of medical disorders (see Hubner C A, Jentsch T J, Hum. Mol. Genet., 11(20): 2435-45 (2002) for a general review of inherited ion channel disorders) including epilepsy (Yogeeswari et al., Curr. Drug Targets, 5(7): 589-602 (2004)), arrhythmia (Noble D., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 99(9): 5755-6 (2002)) myotonia (Cannon, S C, Kidney Int. 57(3): 772-9 (2000)), and pain (Wood, J N et al., J. Neurobiol., 61(1): 55-71 (2004)). There are currently at least nine known members of the family of voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) alpha subunits. Names for this family include SCNx, SCNAx, and Navx.x. The VGSC family has been phylogenetically divided into two subfamilies Nav1.x (all but SCN6A) and Nav2.x (SCN6A). The Nav1.x subfamily can be functionally subdivided into two groups, those which are sensitive to blocking by tetrodotoxin (TTX-sensitive or TTX-s) and those which are resistant to blocking by tetrodotoxin (TTX-resistant or TTX-r). The Nav1.7 (PN1, SCN9A) VGSC is sensitive to blocking by tetrodotoxin and is preferentially expressed in peripheral sympathetic and sensory neurons. The SCN9A gene has been cloned from a number of species, including human, rat, and rabbit and shows ˜90% amino acid identity between the human and rat genes (Toledo-Aral et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 94(4): 1527-1532 (1997)). An increasing body of evidence suggests that Nav1.7 may play a key role in various pain states, including acute, inflammatory and/or neuropathic pain. Deletion of the SCN9A gene in nociceptive neurons of mice led to a reduction in mechanical and thermal pain thresholds and reduction or abolition of inflammatory pain responses (Nassar et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 101(34): 12706-11 (2004)). In humans, Nav1.7 protein has been shown to accumulate in neuromas, particularly painful neuromas (Kretschmer et al., Acta. Neurochir. (Wien), 144(8): 803-10 (2002)). Gain of function mutations of Nav1.7, both familial and sporadic, have been linked to primary erythermalgia, a disease characterized by burning pain and inflammation of the extremities (Yang et al., J. Med. Genet., 41(3): 171-4 (2004), and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (Waxman, S G Neurology. 7; 69(6): 505-7 (2007)). Congruent with this observation is the report that the non-selective sodium channel blockers lidocaine and mexiletine can provide symptomatic relief in cases of familial erythermalgia (Legroux-Crepel et al., Ann. Dermatol Venereol., 130: 429-433) and carbamazepine is effective in reducing the number and severity of attacks in PEPD (Fertleman et al, Neuron.; 52(5):767-74 (2006). Further evidence of the role of Nav1.7 in pain is found in the phenotype of loss of function mutations of the SCN9A gene. Cox and colleagues (Nature, 444(7121):894-8 (2006)) were the first to report an association between loss-of-function mutations of SNC9A and congenital indifference to pain (CIP), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a complete indifference or insensitivity to painful stimuli. Subsequent studies have revealed a number of different mutations that result in a loss of function of the SCN9A gene and the CIP phenotype (Goldberg et al, Clin Genet.; 71(4): 311-9 (2007), Ahmad et al, Hum Mol. Genet. 1; 16(17): 2114-21 (2007)). Nav 1.7 inhibitors are therefore potentially useful in the treatment of a wide range of disorders, particularly pain, including: acute pain; chronic pain; neuropathic pain; inflammatory pain; visceral pain; nociceptive pain including post-surgical pain; and mixed pain types involving the viscera, gastrointestinal tract, cranial structures, musculoskeletal system, spine, urogenital system, cardiovascular system and CNS, including cancer pain, back and orofacial pain. Certain inhibitors of voltage gated sodium channels useful in the treatment of pain are known. Thus WO-A-2005/013914 discloses heteroarylamino sulfonylphenyl derivatives, WO-A-2008/118758 aryl sulphonamides and WO-A-2009/012242 N-thiazolyl benzenesulfonamides. There is, however, an ongoing need to provide new Nav1.7 inhibitors that are good drug candidates. Preferably compounds are selective Nav1.7 channel inhibitors. That is, preferred compounds show an affinity for the Nav1.7 channel over other Nav channels. In particular, they should show an affinity for the Nav1.7 channel which is greater than their affinity for Nav1.5 channels. Advantageously, compounds should show little or no affinity for the Nav1.5 channel. Selectivity for the Nav1.7 channel over Nav1.5 may potentially lead to one or more improvements in side-effect profile. Without wishing to be bound by theory, such selectivity is thought to reduce any cardiovascular side effects which may be associated with affinity for the Nav1.5 channel. Preferably compounds demonstrate a selectivity of 10-fold, more preferably 30-fold, most preferably 100-fold, for the Nav 1.7 channel when compared to their selectivity for the Nav1.5 channel whilst maintaining good potency for the Nav1.7 channel. Furthermore, preferred compounds should have one or more of the following properties: be well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; be metabolically stable; have a good metabolic profile, in particular with respect to the toxicity or allergenicity of any metabolites formed; or possess favourable pharmacokinetic properties whilst still retaining their activity profile as Nav1.7 channel inhibitors. They should be non-toxic and demonstrate few side-effects. Ideal drug candidates should exist in a physical form that is stable, non-hygroscopic and easily formulated. We have now found new sulphonamide Nav1.7 inhibitors. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a compound selected from the following list: 5-Chloro-4-[4-chloro-2-(2-piperazin-1-ylpyrimidin-4-yl)phenoxy]-2-fluoro-N-1,3-thiazol-4-ylbenzenesulfonamide;5-Chloro-4-[4-chloro-2-(2-piperazin-1-ylpyrimidin-4-yl)phenoxy]-2-fluoro-N-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylbenzenesulfonamide;5-Chloro-2-fluoro-4-[5-fluoro-2-pyridazin-4-yl-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-N-1,3-thiazol-4-ylbenzenesulfonamide;5-Chloro-2-fluoro-4-[4-fluoro-2-pyridazin-4-yl-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-N-1,3-thiazol-4-ylbenzenesulfonamide;4-[2-(2-Aminopyridin-4-yl)-4-chlorophenoxy]-5-chloro-2-fluoro-N-(5-fluoropyrimidin-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide;4-[2-(2-Aminopyridin-4-yl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-5-chloro-2-fluoro-N-(5-fluoropyrimidin-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide;4-[2-(2-Aminopyridin-4-yl)-4-fluorophenoxy]-5-chloro-2-fluoro-N-1,3-thiazol-4-ylbenzenesulfonamide;4-[2-(3-Amino-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenoxy]-5-chloro-2-fluoro-N-1,3-thiazol-4-ylbenzenesulfonamide;4-[2-(2-Aminopyridin-4-yl)-4-chlorophenoxy]-3-chloro-N-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylbenzenesulfonamide;4-[2-(2-Aminopyridin-4-yl)-4-chlorophenoxy]-5-chloro-2-fluoro-N-1,3-thiazol-4-ylbenzenesulfonamide;4-[2-(5-Amino-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-4-fluorophenoxy]-5-chloro-2-fluoro-N-1,3-thiazol-4-ylbenzenesulfonamide;5-Chloro-2-fluoro-4-[2-pyridazin-4-yl-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenoxy]-N-1,3-thiazol-4-ylbenzenesulfonamide;4-[2-(1-Azetidin-3-yl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-5-chloro-2-fluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-N-1,3,4-thiadiazol-5-ylbenzenesulfonamide;5-Chloro-2-fluoro-4-{4-trifluoromethyl-2-[1-(1-methylazetidin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]phenoxy}-N-1,3,4-thiadiazol-ylbenzenesulfonamide;3-Cyano-4-[2-(3-methylpyridazin-4-yl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-N-1,2,4-thiadiazol-5-ylbenzenesulfonamide;3-Methyl-4-[2-pyridazin-4-yl-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-N-1,2,4-thiadiazol-5-ylbenzenesulfonamide;4-[4-chloro-2-(2-piperazin-1-ylpyrimidin-4-yl)phenoxy]-2,5-difluoro-N-1,3-thiazol-4-ylbenzenesulfonamide;4-[4-chloro-2-(2-piperazin-1-ylpyridin-4-yl)phenoxy]-2,5-difluoro-N-pyrimidin-2-ylbenzenesulfonamide;4-[4-chloro-2-(2-piperazin-1-ylpyridin-4-yl)phenoxy]-3-cyano-N-pyrimidin-2-ylbenzenesulfonamide;4-[4-chloro-2-(2-piperazin-1-ylpyrimidin-4-yl)phenoxy]-3-cyano-N-pyrimidin-2-ylbenzenesulfonamide; or4-[4-chloro-2-(2-piperazin-1-ylpyrimidin-4-yl)phenoxy]-2,5-difluoro-N-pyrimidin-2-ylbenzenesulfonamide; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Hereinafter, all references to compounds of the invention include compounds of list (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or multi-component complexes thereof, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvates or multi-component complexes of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of list (I), as discussed in more detail below. Preferred compounds of the invention are compounds of list (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the acetate, adipate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate, bicarbonate/carbonate, bisulphate/sulphate, borate, camsylate, citrate, cyclamate, edisylate, esylate, formate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hexafluorophosphate, hibenzate, hydrochloride/chloride, hydrobromide/bromide, hydroiodide/iodide, isethionate, lactate, malate, maleate, malonate, mesylate, methylsulphate, naphthylate, 2-napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, orotate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, phosphate/hydrogen phosphate/dihydrogen phosphate, pyroglutamate, saccharate, stearate, succinate, tannate, tartrate, tosylate, trifluoroacetate and xinofoate salts. Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the aluminium, arginine, benzathine, calcium, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine, magnesium, meglumine, olamine, potassium, sodium, tromethamine and zinc salts. Hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulphate and hemicalcium salts. The skilled person will appreciate that the aforementioned salts include ones wherein the counterion is optically active, for example d-lactate or 1-lysine, or racemic, for example dl-tartrate or dl-arginine. For a review on suitable salts, see “Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use” by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002). Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of list (I) may be prepared by one or more of three methods: (i) by reacting the compound of list (I) with the desired acid or base;(ii) by removing an acid- or base-labile protecting group from a suitable precursor of the compound of list (I) using the desired acid or base; or(iii) by converting one salt of the compound of list (I) to another by reaction with an appropriate acid or base or by means of a suitable ion exchange column. All three reactions are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionisation in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised. The compounds of list (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may exist in both unsolvated and solvated forms. The term ‘solvate’ is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising a compound of list (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term ‘hydrate’ is employed when said solvent is water. Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D2O, d6-acetone and d6-DMSO. A currently accepted classification system for organic hydrates is one that defines isolated site, channel, or metal-ion coordinated hydrates—see Polymorphism in Pharmaceutical Solids by K. R. Morris (Ed. H. G. Brittain, Marcel Dekker, 1995), incorporated herein by reference. Isolated site hydrates are ones in which the water molecules are isolated from direct contact with each other by intervening organic molecules. In channel hydrates, the water molecules lie in lattice channels where they are next to other water molecules. In metal-ion coordinated hydrates, the water molecules are bonded to the metal ion. When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm. The compounds of the invention may exist in a continuum of solid states ranging from fully amorphous to fully crystalline. The term ‘amorphous’ refers to a state in which the material lacks long range order at the molecular level and, depending upon temperature, may exhibit the physical properties of a solid or a liquid. Typically such materials do not give distinctive X-ray diffraction patterns and, while exhibiting the properties of a solid, are more formally described as a liquid. Upon heating, a change from solid to liquid properties occurs which is characterised by a change of state, typically second order (‘glass transition’). The term ‘crystalline’ refers to a solid phase in which the material has a regular ordered internal structure at the molecular level and gives a distinctive X-ray diffraction pattern with defined peaks. Such materials when heated sufficiently will also exhibit the properties of a liquid, but the change from solid to liquid is characterised by a phase change, typically first order (‘melting point’). Also included within the scope of the invention are multi-component complexes (other than salts and solvates) of compounds of list (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein the drug and at least one other component are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Complexes of this type include clathrates (drug-host inclusion complexes) and co-crystals. The latter are typically defined as crystalline complexes of neutral molecular constituents which are bound together through non-covalent interactions, but could also be a complex of a neutral molecule with a salt. Co-crystals may be prepared by melt crystallisation, by recrystallisation from solvents, or by physically grinding the components together—see Chem Commun, 17, 1889-1896, by O. Almarsson and M. J. Zaworotko (2004), incorporated herein by reference. For a general review of multi-component complexes, see J Pharm Sci, 64 (8), 1269-1288, by Haleblian (August 1975), incorporated herein by reference. The compounds of the invention may also exist in a mesomorphic state (mesophase or liquid crystal) when subjected to suitable conditions. The mesomorphic state is intermediate between the true crystalline state and the true liquid state (either melt or solution). Mesomorphism arising as the result of a change in temperature is described as ‘thermotropic’ and that resulting from the addition of a second component, such as water or another solvent, is described as lyotropic'. Compounds that have the potential to form lyotropic mesophases are described as ‘amphiphilic’ and consist of molecules which possess an ionic (such as —COO−Na+, —COO−K+, or —SO3−Na+) or non-ionic (such as —N−N+(CH3)3) polar head group. For more information, see Crystals and the Polarizing Microscope by N. H. Hartshorne and A. Stuart, 4th Edition (Edward Arnold, 1970), incorporated herein by reference. The compounds of the invention may be administered as prodrugs. Thus certain derivatives of compounds of list (I) which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds of list (I) having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as ‘prodrugs’. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in ‘Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T Higuchi and W Stella) and ‘Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design’, Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E B Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association). Prodrugs can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in a compound of list (I) with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as ‘pro-moieties’ as described, for example, in “Design of Prodrugs” by H Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985). Examples of prodrugs include phosphate prodrugs, such as dihydrogen or dialkyl (e.g. di-tert-butyl)phosphate prodrugs. Further examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references. Also included within the scope of the invention are metabolites of compounds of list (I), that is, compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug. Some examples of metabolites in accordance with the invention include, where the compound of list (I) contains a phenyl (Ph) moiety, a phenol derivative thereof (-Ph>-PhOH); The scope of the invention includes all crystal forms of the compounds of the invention, including racemates and racemic mixtures (conglomerates) thereof. Stereoisomeric conglomerates may also be separated by the conventional techniques described herein just above. The scope of the invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of the invention wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates in nature. Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, such as 2H and 3H, carbon, such as 11C, 13C and 14C, chlorine, such as 36Cl, fluorine, such as 18F, iodine, such as 123I and 125I, nitrogen, such as 13N and 15N, oxygen, such as 15O, 17O and 18O, phosphorus, such as 32P, and sulphur, such as 35S. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the invention, for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. 3H, and carbon-14, i.e. 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 11C, 18F, 15O and 13N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds of list (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed. Also within the scope of the invention are intermediate compounds as hereinafter defined, all salts, solvates and complexes thereof and all solvates and complexes of salts thereof as defined hereinbefore for compounds of list (I). The invention includes all polymorphs of the aforementioned species and crystal habits thereof. Compounds of the invention intended for pharmaceutical use may be administered as crystalline or amorphous products or may exist in a continuum of solid states ranging from fully amorphous to fully crystalline. They may be obtained, for example, as solid plugs, powders, or films by methods such as precipitation, crystallization, freeze drying, spray drying, or evaporative drying. Microwave or radio frequency drying may be used for this purpose. They may be administered alone or in combination with one or more other compounds of the invention or in combination with one or more other drugs (or as any combination thereof). Generally, they will be administered as a formulation in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The term ‘excipient’ is used herein to describe any ingredient other than the compound(s) of the invention. The choice of excipient will to a large extent depend on factors such as the particular mode of administration, the effect of the excipient on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form. In another aspect the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the delivery of compounds of the present invention and methods for their preparation will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Such compositions and methods for their preparation may be found, for example, in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences”, 19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company, 1995). Suitable modes of administration include oral, parenteral, topical, inhaled/intranasal, rectal/intravaginal, and ocular/aural administration. Formulations suitable for the aforementioned modes of administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. The compounds of the invention may be administered orally. Oral administration may involve swallowing, so that the compound enters the gastrointestinal tract, or buccal or sublingual administration may be employed by which the compound enters the blood stream directly from the mouth. Formulations suitable for oral administration include solid formulations such as tablets, capsules containing particulates, liquids, or powders, lozenges (including liquid-filled), chews, multi- and nano-particulates, gels, solid solution, liposome, films, ovules, sprays, liquid formulations and buccal/mucoadhesive patches. Liquid formulations include suspensions, solutions, syrups and elixirs. Such formulations may be employed as fillers in soft or hard capsules and typically comprise a carrier, for example, water, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methylcellulose, or a suitable oil, and one or more emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents. Liquid formulations may also be prepared by the reconstitution of a solid, for example, from a sachet. The compounds of the invention may also be used in fast-dissolving, fast-disintegrating dosage forms such as those described in Expert Opinion in Therapeutic Patents, 11 (6), 981-986, by Liang and Chen (2001). For tablet dosage forms, depending on dose, the drug may make up from 1 weight % to 80 weight % of the dosage form, more typically from 5 weight % to 60 weight % of the dosage form. In addition to the drug, tablets generally contain a disintegrant. Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polyvinylpyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, lower alkyl-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, starch, pregelatinised starch and sodium alginate. Generally, the disintegrant will comprise from 1 weight % to 25 weight %, preferably from 5 weight % to 20 weight % of the dosage form. Binders are generally used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet formulation. Suitable binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, sugars, polyethylene glycol, natural and synthetic gums, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pregelatinised starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Tablets may also contain diluents, such as lactose (monohydrate, spray-dried monohydrate, anhydrous and the like), mannitol, xylitol, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate. Tablets may also optionally comprise surface active agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate 80, and glidants such as silicon dioxide and talc. When present, surface active agents may comprise from 0.2 weight % to 5 weight % of the tablet, and glidants may comprise from 0.2 weight % to 1 weight % of the tablet. Tablets also generally contain lubricants such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, and mixtures of magnesium stearate with sodium lauryl sulphate. Lubricants generally comprise from 0.25 weight % to 10 weight %, preferably from 0.5 weight % to 3 weight % of the tablet. Other possible ingredients include anti-oxidants, colourants, flavouring agents, preservatives and taste-masking agents. Exemplary tablets contain up to about 80% drug, from about 10 weight % to about 90 weight % binder, from about 0 weight % to about 85 weight % diluent, from about 2 weight % to about 10 weight % disintegrant, and from about 0.25 weight % to about 10 weight % lubricant. Tablet blends may be compressed directly or by roller to form tablets. Tablet blends or portions of blends may alternatively be wet-, dry-, or melt-granulated, melt congealed, or extruded before tabletting. The final formulation may comprise one or more layers and may be coated or uncoated; it may even be encapsulated. The formulation of tablets is discussed in “Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets”, Vol. 1, by H. Lieberman and L. Lachman (Marcel Dekker, New York, 1980). Suitable modified release formulations for the purposes of the invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles are to be found in “Pharmaceutical Technology On-line”, 25(2), 1-14, by Verma et al (2001). The use of chewing gum to achieve controlled release is described in WO 00/35298. The compounds of the invention may also be administered directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ. Suitable means for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular and subcutaneous. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques. Parenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water. The preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by lyophilisation, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art. The solubility of compounds of list (I) used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents. Formulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated as a solid, semi-solid, or thixotropic liquid for administration as an implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations include drug-coated stents and poly(dl-lactic-coglycolic) acid (PGLA) microspheres. The compounds of the invention may also be administered topically to the skin or mucosa, that is, dermally or transdermally. Typical formulations for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, implants, sponges, fibres, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Penetration enhancers may be incorporated—see, for example, J Pharm Sci, 88 (10), 955-958, by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999). Other means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and microneedle or needle-free (e.g. Powderject™ Bioject™, etc.) injection. The compounds of the invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler or as an aerosol spray from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane. For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin. The pressurised container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilising, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid. Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying. Capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as I-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose. A suitable solution formulation for use in an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1 μg to 20 mg of the compound of the invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1 μl to 100 μl. A typical formulation may comprise a compound of list (I), propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol. Suitable flavours, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for inhaled/intranasal administration. In the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve which delivers a metered amount. Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or “puff” containing from 1 μg to 100 mg of the compound of list (I). The overall daily dose will typically be in the range 1 μg to 200 mg which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day. The compounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a suppository, pessary, microbicide, vaginal ring or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives may be used as appropriate. The compounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronised suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (e.g. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (e.g. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis. The compounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration. Drug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubiliser. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in International Patent Applications Nos. WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148. For administration to human patients, the total daily dose of the compounds of the invention is typically in the range 1 mg to 10 g, such as 10 mg to 1 g, for example 25 mg to 500 mg depending, of course, on the mode of administration and efficacy. For example, oral administration may require a total daily dose of from 50 mg to 100 mg. The total daily dose may be administered in single or divided doses and may, at the physician's discretion, fall outside of the typical range given herein. These dosages are based on an average human subject having a weight of about 60 kg to 70 kg. The physician will readily be able to determine doses for subjects whose weight falls outside this range, such as infants and the elderly. As noted above, the compounds of the invention are useful because they exhibit pharmacological activity in animals, i.e., Nav1.7 channel inhibition. More particularly, the compounds of the invention are of use in the treatment of disorders for which a Nav1.7 inhibitor is indicated. Preferably the animal is a mammal, more preferably a human. In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of the invention for use as a medicament. In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of the invention for the treatment of a disorder for which a Nav1.7 inhibitor is indicated. In a further aspect of the invention there is provided use of a compound of the invention for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a disorder for which a Nav1.7 inhibitor is indicated. In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of treating a disorder in an animal (preferably a mammal, more preferably a human) for which a Nav1.7 inhibitor is indicated, comprising administering to said animal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Disorders for which a Nav1.7 inhibitor is indicated include pain, particularly neuropathic, nociceptive and inflammatory pain. Physiological pain is an important protective mechanism designed to warn of danger from potentially injurious stimuli from the external environment. The system operates through a specific set of primary sensory neurones and is activated by noxious stimuli via peripheral transducing mechanisms (see Millan, 1999, Prog. Neurobiol., 57, 1-164 for a review). These sensory fibres are known as nociceptors and are characteristically small diameter axons with slow conduction velocities. Nociceptors encode the intensity, duration and quality of noxious stimulus and by virtue of their topographically organised projection to the spinal cord, the location of the stimulus. The nociceptors are found on nociceptive nerve fibres of which there are two main types, A-delta fibres (myelinated) and C fibres (non-myelinated). The activity generated by nociceptor input is transferred, after complex processing in the dorsal horn, either directly, or via brain stem relay nuclei, to the ventrobasal thalamus and then on to the cortex, where the sensation of pain is generated. Pain may generally be classified as acute or chronic. Acute pain begins suddenly and is short-lived (usually twelve weeks or less). It is usually associated with a specific cause such as a specific injury and is often sharp and severe. It is the kind of pain that can occur after specific injuries resulting from surgery, dental work, a strain or a sprain. Acute pain does not generally result in any persistent psychological response. In contrast, chronic pain is long-term pain, typically persisting for more than three months and leading to significant psychological and emotional problems. Common examples of chronic pain are neuropathic pain (e.g. painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia), carpal tunnel syndrome, back pain, headache, cancer pain, arthritic pain and chronic post-surgical pain. When a substantial injury occurs to body tissue, via disease or trauma, the characteristics of nociceptor activation are altered and there is sensitisation in the periphery, locally around the injury and centrally where the nociceptors terminate. These effects lead to a hightened sensation of pain. In acute pain these mechanisms can be useful, in promoting protective behaviours which may better enable repair processes to take place. The normal expectation would be that sensitivity returns to normal once the injury has healed. However, in many chronic pain states, the hypersensitivity far outlasts the healing process and is often due to nervous system injury. This injury often leads to abnormalities in sensory nerve fibres associated with maladaptation and aberrant activity (Woolf & Salter, 2000, Science, 288, 1765-1768). Clinical pain is present when discomfort and abnormal sensitivity feature among the patient's symptoms. Patients tend to be quite heterogeneous and may present with various pain symptoms. Such symptoms include: 1) spontaneous pain which may be dull, burning, or stabbing; 2) exaggerated pain responses to noxious stimuli (hyperalgesia); and 3) pain produced by normally innocuous stimuli (allodynia—Meyer et al., 1994, Textbook of Pain, 13-44). Although patients suffering from various forms of acute and chronic pain may have similar symptoms, the underlying mechanisms may be different and may, therefore, require different treatment strategies. Pain can also therefore be divided into a number of different subtypes according to differing pathophysiology, including nociceptive, inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Nociceptive pain is induced by tissue injury or by intense stimuli with the potential to cause injury. Pain afferents are activated by transduction of stimuli by nociceptors at the site of injury and activate neurons in the spinal cord at the level of their termination. This is then relayed up the spinal tracts to the brain where pain is perceived (Meyer et al., 1994, Textbook of Pain, 13-44). The activation of nociceptors activates two types of afferent nerve fibres. Myelinated A-delta fibres transmit rapidly and are responsible for sharp and stabbing pain sensations, whilst unmyelinated C fibres transmit at a slower rate and convey a dull or aching pain. Moderate to severe acute nociceptive pain is a prominent feature of pain from central nervous system trauma, strains/sprains, burns, myocardial infarction and acute pancreatitis, post-operative pain (pain following any type of surgical procedure), posttraumatic pain, renal colic, cancer pain and back pain. Cancer pain may be chronic pain such as tumour related pain (e.g. bone pain, headache, facial pain or visceral pain) or pain associated with cancer therapy (e.g. postchemotherapy syndrome, chronic postsurgical pain syndrome or post radiation syndrome). Cancer pain may also occur in response to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiotherapy. Back pain may be due to herniated or ruptured intervertabral discs or abnormalities of the lumber facet joints, sacroiliac joints, paraspinal muscles or the posterior longitudinal ligament. Back pain may resolve naturally but in some patients, where it lasts over 12 weeks, it becomes a chronic condition which can be particularly debilitating. Neuropathic pain is currently defined as pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system. Nerve damage can be caused by trauma and disease and thus the term ‘neuropathic pain’ encompasses many disorders with diverse aetiologies. These include, but are not limited to, peripheral neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, back pain, cancer neuropathy, HIV neuropathy, phantom limb pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, central post-stroke pain and pain associated with chronic alcoholism, hypothyroidism, uremia, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and vitamin deficiency. Neuropathic pain is pathological as it has no protective role. It is often present well after the original cause has dissipated, commonly lasting for years, significantly decreasing a patient's quality of life (Woolf and Mannion, 1999, Lancet, 353, 1959-1964). The symptoms of neuropathic pain are difficult to treat, as they are often heterogeneous even between patients with the same disease (Woolf & Decosterd, 1999, Pain Supp., 6, S141-S147; Woolf and Mannion, 1999, Lancet, 353, 1959-1964). They include spontaneous pain, which can be continuous, and paroxysmal or abnormal evoked pain, such as hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to a noxious stimulus) and allodynia (sensitivity to a normally innocuous stimulus). The inflammatory process is a complex series of biochemical and cellular events, activated in response to tissue injury or the presence of foreign substances, which results in swelling and pain (Levine and Taiwo, 1994, Textbook of Pain, 45-56). Arthritic pain is the most common inflammatory pain. Rheumatoid disease is one of the commonest chronic inflammatory conditions in developed countries and rheumatoid arthritis is a common cause of disability. The exact aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, but current hypotheses suggest that both genetic and microbiological factors may be important (Grennan & Jayson, 1994, Textbook of Pain, 397-407). It has been estimated that almost 16 million Americans have symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) or degenerative joint disease, most of whom are over 60 years of age, and this is expected to increase to 40 million as the age of the population increases, making this a public health problem of enormous magnitude (Houge & Mersfelder, 2002, Ann Pharmacother., 36, 679-686; McCarthy et al., 1994, Textbook of Pain, 387-395). Most patients with osteoarthritis seek medical attention because of the associated pain. Arthritis has a significant impact on psychosocial and physical function and is known to be the leading cause of disability in later life. Ankylosing spondylitis is also a rheumatic disease that causes arthritis of the spine and sacroiliac joints. It varies from intermittent episodes of back pain that occur throughout life to a severe chronic disease that attacks the spine, peripheral joints and other body organs. Another type of inflammatory pain is visceral pain which includes pain associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Visceral pain is pain associated with the viscera, which encompass the organs of the abdominal cavity. These organs include the sex organs, spleen and part of the digestive system. Pain associated with the viscera can be divided into digestive visceral pain and non-digestive visceral pain. Commonly encountered gastrointestinal (GI) disorders that cause pain include functional bowel disorder (FBD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These GI disorders include a wide range of disease states that are currently only moderately controlled, including, in respect of FBD, gastro-esophageal reflux, dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS), and, in respect of IBD, Crohn's disease, ileitis and ulcerative colitis, all of which regularly produce visceral pain. Other types of visceral pain include the pain associated with dysmenorrhea, cystitis and pancreatitis and pelvic pain. It should be noted that some types of pain have multiple aetiologies and thus can be classified in more than one area, e.g. back pain and cancer pain have both nociceptive and neuropathic components. Other types of pain include: pain resulting from musculo-skeletal disorders, including myalgia, fibromyalgia, spondylitis, sero-negative (non-rheumatoid) arthropathies, non-articular rheumatism, dystrophinopathy, glycogenolysis, polymyositis and pyomyositis;heart and vascular pain, including pain caused by angina, myocardical infarction, mitral stenosis, pericarditis, Raynaud's phenomenon, scleredoma and skeletal muscle ischemia;head pain, such as migraine (including migraine with aura and migraine without aura), cluster headache, tension-type headache mixed headache and headache associated with vascular disorders;erythermalgia; andorofacial pain, including dental pain, optic pain, burning mouth syndrome and temporomandibular myofascial pain.

There is also included within the scope the present invention combinations of a compound of the invention together with one or more additional therapeutic agents which slow down the rate of metabolism of the compound of the invention, thereby leading to increased exposure in patients. Increasing the exposure in such a manner is known as boosting. This has the benefit of increasing the efficacy of the compound of the invention or reducing the dose required to achieve the same efficacy as an unboosted dose. The metabolism of the compounds of the invention includes oxidative processes carried out by P450 (CYP450) enzymes, particularly CYP 3A4 and conjugation by UDP glucuronosyl transferase and sulphating enzymes. Thus, among the agents that may be used to increase the exposure of a patient to a compound of the present invention are those that can act as inhibitors of at least one isoform of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. The isoforms of CYP450 that may be beneficially inhibited include, but are not limited to, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Suitable agents that may be used to inhibit CYP 3A4 include ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, N-(3,4-difluorobenzyl)-N-methyl-2-{[(4-methoxypyridin-3-yl)amino]sulfonyl}benzamide and N-(1-(2-(5-(4-fluorobenzyl)-3-(pyridin-4-yl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)acetyl)piperidin-4-yl)methanesulfonamide. It is within the scope of the invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions. Thus the kit of the invention comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like. The kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically comprises directions for administration and may be provided with a so-called memory aid. In another aspect the invention provides a pharmaceutical product (such as in the form of a kit) comprising a compound of the invention together with one or more additional therapeutically active agents as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of a disorder for which a Nav1.7 inhibitor is indicated. It is to be appreciated that all references herein to treatment include curative, palliative and prophylactic treatment. The compounds of the invention may be prepared by any method known in the art for the preparation of compounds of analogous structure. In particular, the compounds of the invention can be prepared by the specific methods described in the Examples, or by similar processes thereto. The skilled person will appreciate that the experimental conditions set forth in the Examples that follow illustrate suitable conditions for effecting the transformations, that it may be desirable to vary the precise conditions employed, and further that it may be desirable to carry out the transformations in a different order from that described. In addition, the skilled person will appreciate that it may be desirable at any stage in the synthesis of compounds of the invention to protect one or more sensitive groups, so as to prevent undesirable side reactions. In particular, it may be desirable to protect amino groups. The protecting groups used in the preparation of the compounds of the invention may be used in conventional manner. See, for example, those described in ‘Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis’ by Theodora W Greene and Peter G M Wuts, fourth edition, (John Wiley and Sons, 2006), in particular chapter 7 (“Protection for the Amino Group”), incorporated herein by reference, which also describes methods for the removal of such groups. When preparing a compound of the invention, a person skilled in the art may select the form of intermediate which provides the best combination of features for this purpose. Such features include the melting point, solubility, processability and yield of the intermediate form and the resulting ease with which the product may be purified on isolation. Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomer precursors include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Alternatively, a racemic precursor may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1-phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person. Chiral precursors may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% by volume of isopropanol, typically from 2% to 20%, and from 0 to 5% by volume of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture. Mixtures of stereoisomers may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art; see, for example, “Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds” by E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley, New York, 1994. The invention is illustrated by the following non-limiting examples in which the following abbreviations and definitions may be used: DMSO means dimethyl sulphoxide; GCMS means gas chromatography mass spectroscopy; HPLC means high performance liquid chromnatography; LCMS means liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy; NaOH means sodium hydroxide; and NH4Cl means ammonium chloride. 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were in all cases consistent with the proposed structures. Characteristic chemical shifts (δ) are given in parts-per-million downfield from tetramethylsilane using conventional abbreviations for designation of major peaks: e.g. s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br, broad. The following abbreviations have been used for common solvents: CDCl3, deuterochloroform; d6-DMSO, deuterodimethylsulphoxide. Mass spectra (m/z) were recorded using either electrospray ionisation (ESI) or atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI). When relevant, and unless stated otherwise, the m/z data provided are for isotopes 19F, 35Cl and 79Br. Where compounds were purified by HPLC and/or analysed by LCMS the following methods were used: Preparative Reverse Phase HPLC Methods: a) Phenomenex 250×30 mm 15 micron C18 column. 40 mL/minutes. Gradient 85% A to 100% B over 25 minutes. Solvent A: 7800 water/200 acetonitrile/8 trifluoroacetic acid.

Solvent A: 7800 water/200 acetonitrile/8 trifluoroacetic acid. Solvent B: 7200 acetonitrile/800 water/8 trifluoroacetic acid, 254 nM UV detection. LC/MS Analysis Mass spectrometry data was acquired on a Sciex API150 with MassChrom software interfaced to a Michrom Magic HPLC and CTC autosampler. MS scan data were obtained by alternately scanning positive and negative ion from 40 to 800 daltons with a 0.1 dalton step and a 0.15 msec dwell time. The ionization voltage was 4000 for positive ion (−4200 for negative ion) with the temperature at 400 C, nebulizer gas set to 7, and the curtain gas set to 8. Lens and ring voltages were periodically optimized. HPLC flow rate was 500 μL/min during the 1 minute gradient from 20% buffer B to 98% buffer B on a 1×25 mm 5 micron 100A C18AQ Magic Bullet from Michrom Bioresources. The flow rate was increased to 700 μL/min with the gradient held at 98% B for 1.2 minutes. The composition of buffer A was water with 0.1% formic acid and buffer B was methanol with 1% water and 0.1% formic acid.

Cell Line Construction and Maintenance Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells were transfected with an hSCN9A construct using lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen), using standard techniques. Cells stably expressing the hSCN9A constructs were identified by their resistance to G-418 (400 μg/ml). Clones were screened for expression using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. Cell Culture HEK cells stably transfected with hSCN9A were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml G-418 in an incubator at 37° C. with a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. For HTS, cells were harvested from flasks by trypsinization and replated in an appropriate multi-well plate (typically 96 or 384 wells/plate) such that confluence would be achieved within 24 hours of plating. For electrophysiological studies, cells were removed from the culture flask by brief trypsinization and re-plated at low density onto glass cover slips. Cells were typically used for electrophysiological experiments within 24 to 72 hours after plating. Electrophysiological Recording Cover slips containing HEK cells expressing hSCN9A were placed in a bath on the stage of an inverted microscope and perfused (approximately 1 ml/minutes) with extracellular solution of the following composition: 138 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 5.4 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Pipettes were filled with an intracellular solution of the following composition: 135 mM CsF, 5 mM CsCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3 with NaOH, and had a resistance of 1 to 2 megaohms. The osmolarity of the extracellular and intracellular solutions was 300 mOsm/kg and 295 mOsm/kg, respectively. All recordings were made at room temperature (22-24° C.) using AXOPATCH 200B amplifiers and PCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, Calif.). hSCN9A currents in HEK cells were measured using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique (Hamill et al., 1981). Uncompensated series resistance was typically 2 to 5 mega ohms and >85% series resistance compensation was routinely achieved. As a result, voltage errors were negligible and no correction was applied. Current records were acquired at 20 to 50 KHz and filtered at 5 to 10 KHz. HEK cells stably transfected with hSCN9A were viewed under Hoffman contrast optics and placed in front of an array of flow pipes emitting either control or compound-containing extracellular solutions. All compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to make 10 mM stock solutions, which were then diluted into extracellular solution to attain the final concentrations desired. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide (<0.3% dimethyl sulfoxide) was found to have no significant effect on hSCN9A sodium currents. The voltage-dependence of inactivation was determined by applying a series of depolarizing prepulses (8 sec long in 10 mV increments) from a negative holding potential. The voltage was then immediately stepped to 0 mV to assess the magnitude of the sodium current. Currents elicited at 0 mV were plotted as a function of prepulse potential to allow estimation of the voltage at which 50% of the channels were inactivated (midpoint of inactivation or V1/2). Compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit hSCN9A sodium channels by activating the channel with a 20 msec voltage step to 0 mV following an 8 second conditioning prepulse to the empirically determined V1/2. Compound effect (% inhibition) was determined by difference in current amplitude before and after application of test compounds. For ease of comparison, “estimated IC-50” (EIC50) values were calculated from single point electrophysiology data by the following equation, (tested concentration, uM)×(100−% inhibition/% inhibition). Inhibition values <20% and >80% were excluded from the calculation. Electrophysiological assays were conducted with PatchXpress 7000 hardware and associated software (Molecular Devices Corp). All assay buffers and solutions were identical to those used in conventional whole-cell voltage clamp experiments described above. hSCN9A cells were grown as above to 50%-80% confluency and harvested by trypsinization. Trypsinized cells were washed and resuspended in extracellular buffer at a concentration of 1×106 cells/ml. The onboard liquid handling facility of the PatchXpress was used for dispensing cells and application of test compounds. Determination of the voltage midpoint of inactivation was as described for conventional whole-cell recordings. Cells were then voltage-clamped to the empirically determined V1/2 and current was activated by a 20 msec voltage step to 0 mV. Electrophysiological assays may also be conducted using the Ionworks Quattro automated electrophysiological platform (Molecular Devices Corp). Intracellular and extracellular solutions were as described above with the following changes, 100 μg/ml amphotericin was added to the intracellular solution to perforate the membrane and allow electrical access to the cells. hSCN9A cells were grown and harvested as for PatchXpress and cells were resuspended in extracellular solution at a concentration of 3-4×106 cells/ml. The onboard liquid handling facility of the Ionworks Quattro was used for dispensing cells and application of test compounds. A voltage protocol was then applied that comprised of a voltage step to fully inactivate the sodium channels, followed by a brief hyperpolarized recovery period to allow partial recovery from inactivation for unblocked sodium channels, followed by a test depolarized voltage step to assess magnitude of inhibition by test compound. Compound effect was determined based on current amplitude difference between the pre-compound addition and post-compound addition scans. Compounds of the Examples were tested in the assay described above using the PatchXpress platform and found to have the Nav1.7 EIC50 (uM) values specified in the table below. Ex. EIC50 1 0.0067 2 0.005 3 0.018 4 0.0275 5 0.0118 6 0.0085 7 0.0147 8 0.0099 9 0.024 10 0.0108 11 0.0166 12 0.0146 13 0.0011 14 0.0026 15 0.0116 16 0.0032 17 0.01 The ability of compounds of list (I) to block the Nav1.5 (or SCN5A) channel can also be measured using an assay analogous to that described above but replacing the SCN9A gene with the SCN5A gene. All other conditions remain the same including the same cell line and conditions for cell growth. The estimated IC50s are determined at the half inactivation for Nav1.5. These results can be compared to the EIC50 value at the Nav1.7 channel to determine the selectivity of a given compound for Nav1.7 vs Nav1.5. 1.
