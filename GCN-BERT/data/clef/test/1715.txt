RELEASE ON DEMAND CORROSION INHIBITOR COMPOSITION RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] NONE. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH [0002] NONE TECHNICAL FIELD [0003] This invention relates generally to anti-corrosion protective coatings and, more particularly, to anti-corrosion protective coatings comprising non-electrically conductive copolymers and functional groups comprising nitrogen heterocyclics coupled to metallate anions which are releasable in response to corrosion. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0004] Untreated metal surfaces are subject to corrosion which can lead to rust development, weakening, discoloration and failure of the surface. Thus metal substrates are typically treated by a variety of methods to make the surface less reactive and more corrosion resistant. In addition, metal surfaces are often subsequently coated with decorative or additional protective coatings such as resin coatings, primers, paints and other surface treatments. [0005] One common mechanism of corrosion occurs galvanically when atmospheric oxygen oxidizes the metal of a metal substrate. The transfer of electrons from the metal to the oxygen at electrocatalytic sites leads to formation of various metal oxide corrosion products. A variety of treatments can be used to prevent corrosion of metal surfaces such as cold rolled steel, hot rolled steel, zinc, aluminum, and alloys thereof, zinc- and zinc alloy-coated steel, as well as aluminum- and aluminum alloy-coated steel. These treatments include temporary oil-based rust preventatives, phosphate conversion coatings, inorganic and organic passivates, paints, and combinations thereof. [0006] Temporary oil-based rust preventatives are used to provide short-term corrosion protection with ease of removal. They are not desirable for medium- or long-term corrosion protection alone, and when combined with other coatings make the surfaces unpaintable and by the nature of their handling are not suitable for a final consumer product. [0007] Phosphate conversion coatings provide better corrosion protection and paintability, but require quite acidic conditions to operate, which is not desirable due to difficulty in handling the application chemicals, more troublesome waste treatment due to sludge generation, and extra wear on equipment. Such conversion coatings typically require subsequent treatments for maximum benefit. [0008] Inorganic and organic passivates, such as those commonly applied to metal coil stock, provide high degrees of corrosion protection but possess several drawbacks. Many such products either contain chromium, are highly acidic, or both. Chrome is not desirable due to negative environmental considerations, toxicity, and more troublesome waste treatment. Highly acidic treatments are also prone to degrade processing equipment and pose concerns with worker exposure. [0009] Another corrosion resistant coating approach has included the use of electrically conductive polymers, most commonly polyanilines (PANI), that conduct electrical currents without the addition of conductive inorganic substances. The conjugated double bonds in the polymers conduct electrons throughout the coating. Often, these electrically conductive polymer coatings may be doped with anions or they contain anions that release in response to a change in the electrical potential of the metal substrate. It has been suggested that the electrically conductive polymer acts as a cathode to supply sufficient current to form the protective barrier at the site of corrosion and simultaneously release anions which function as active inhibitors toward corrosion. [00010] Electrically conductive polymers have found limited use within industrial coatings stemming from a number of drawbacks. In addition to having a high cost, the film formation properties of conductive polymers are not ideal and these polymers have limited solubility in organic solvents making application difficult. Consequently it is desirable to provide a mechanism for corrosion inhibition not reliant on use of conductive polymers. It is also desirable to provide a coating which responds to corrosion such that the means for inhibiting further corrosive action is not depleted over time in the absence of significant corrosion. Coatings based solely on chrome have a number of undesirable attributes thus, it is desirable to provide coatings which are free of chrome which provide similar benefits against corrosion as chrome-based products. In other instances where chrome will continue to be used, it would be desirable to prolong the corrosion protection afforded by a chrome-containing coating composition. It would also be desirable to provide thin organic passivate compositions which are not acidic. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [00011] In general terms, this invention provides an anti-corrosion coating composition for a metal substrate that comprises only a non-electrically conductive film forming copolymer with no electrically conductive polymers or copolymers, a nitrogen containing functional group X and a metallate anion bonded to a nitrogen in the functional group X by ion pairing wherein the anion of the ion pair is releasable in response to corrosion thereby suppressing the corrosion. [00012] More specifically, in one embodiment the present invention is an anti-corrosion coating composition for a metal substrate comprising only a non-electrically conductive film forming copolymer; a nitrogen containing functional group X, the group X comprising a pyridine, a dihydropyridine, a pyrrole, an imidazole, or mixtures thereof; and a metallate anion, wherein the metallate anion is capable of binding to a nitrogen in the functional group X by ion pairing through Coulomb attraction. The functional group X can be found bound to the copolymer, bound to and cross-linking copolymer chains, free in the coating composition as a separate component of the composition, or as any combination of two or more of these forms. The metallate anion can be provided as either an anionic metal containing species or as a non-anionic metal source that becomes anionic when used in the coating composition. In either case once the coating composition has been applied to a substrate and dried in place the metallate anion is bound to the functional group X by ion pairing. It can be demonstrated that the metallate anion will release from the nitrogen of functional group X once the pH rises above that associated with the pKa of the nitrogen group in functional group X. Upon release of the metallate anion a reduced rate of corrosion is observed. A number of mechanisms can be theorized to explain this effect. The inhibiting anion may oxidize preventing oxidation of the substrate, or it may form insoluble deposits which serve as a barrier at the point of corrosion or both. The functional group X's can be a pyridine, a dihydropyridine, a pyrrole, an imidazole, or mixtures thereof. The functional group X's can further be either substituted or unsubstituted. In a first aspect there is provided an anti-corrosion coating composition for a metal substrate comprising: no electrically conductive polymers and at least one non-electrically conductive film forming copolymer; a nitrogen containing functional group X, wherein said group X is a heterocyclic nitrogen containing functional group X selected from the group consisting of a pyridine, a pyrrole, an imidazole, or mixtures thereof and wherein a positive amount to 100% of said functional group X is bound to said copolymer and crosslinks chains of said copolymer; and a metallate anion, said metallate anion capable of binding to a nitrogen in said functional group X by ion pairing. In a second aspect there is provided a method of protecting a metal substrate from corrosion comprising the steps of: a) selecting a metal substrate; b) applying to the metal substrate a coating composition according to the first aspect above; and c) drying the coating composition onto the substrate thereby forming a corrosion protective coating on the metal substrate wherein the metallate ion is bound to the nitrogen of functional group X by ion pairing. [00013] These and other features and advantages of this invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed description of a preferred embodiment. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [00014] NONE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT [00015] The present invention provides a high level of performance over bare metal surfaces meaning that the metal surface has not been pre-treated with any metal phosphate solutions, chrome-containing rinses, or any other passivating treatments, however the invention can also be used over conventional pretreatments. The invention is suitable for application to a variety of surfaces including steel, cold rolled steel, hot rolled steel, stainless steel, aluminum, however particular benefits are provided on steel coated with zinc or zinc alloys such as electrogalvanized steel, galvalume®, galvanneal, and hot-dipped galvanized steel. [00016] In the present specification and claims when a range is provided for a component, temperature or other item it is intended that the range comprises all sub ranges found within the stated range. [00017] Preferably, the metal surface is clean. In some applications such as a galvanizing line within a steel mill, the invention is applied in continuous fashion following the galvanizing step such that no separate cleaning operation is required. In other applications, a cleaning step prior to application of the invention is preferred. Cleaning of metal surfaces is well known in the art and can include mild or strongly alkaline cleaners. Examples of two alkaline cleaners include Parco® Cleaner ZX-1 and Parco® Cleaner 315 both available from Henkel Surface Technologies. Following cleaning the surface is preferably rinsed with water prior to treatment according to the present invention. [00018] As discussed above, corrosion occurs when atmospheric oxygen is reduced at a location on the metal surface with a concomitant oxidation of metal from the substrate. The present invention is an anti-corrosion coating composition for a metal substrate that comprises only a non-electrically conductive film forming copolymer with no electrically conductive polymers, a nitrogen containing functional group X and a metallate anion bonded to a nitrogen in the functional group X by ion pairing. In the corrosion reaction the oxidation of the metal substrate is accompanied by a localized rise in pH at the corrosion site. It is theorized that the present invention functions by using this localized change in pH to trigger release of the metallate anion from the functional group X. The released anion is believed to, among other things, substitute for the metal in the reaction with oxygen thereby sparing the metal substrate and suppressing the corrosion. [00019] The present invention utilizes non-electrically conductive film forming polymers as are known in the art. Exemplary classes of suitable non-electrically conductive film forming polymers include but are not limited to acrylics, polyurethanes and polyesters. One preferred class of non-electrically conductive film forming polymers are acrylic copolymers such as those made by emulsion polymerization in the form of a latex. Exemplary ethylenically unsaturated monomers used to prepare such copolymers include acrylic acid or esters thereof, methacrylic acid or esters thereof, styrene and vinyl functional compounds all of which are widely used in the art. [00020] Functional group X may be imparted to an acrylic latex in a number of ways. A monomer bearing functional group X may be polymerized directly. Alternatively group X may result from a derivative reaction of a precursor functional group Ζ and the derivation can be carried out before, during, or after polymerization Functional group Ζ can be introduced as an endgroup on a polymerizable monomer, or it can be introduced as an endgroup or pendant group on an oligomer such as a hydrophobe within a mini-emulsion polymerization, or in the form of a small molecule additive. Alternatively, functional group X can be created as a small molecule, described more fully below in formulas I to IV, and this small molecule can be introduced into the coating composition. In some coating compositions functional group X can be found in any combination of two or more of the three forms in the coating composition. For example, a positive portion to 100% of functional group X can be bound to the copolymer chains, or a positive portion to 100% of functional group X can cross-link two copolymer chains, or a positive portion to 100% of functional group X can be free in the coating composition as a small molecule, or the coating composition can include any combination of two or more of theses forms. [00021] In the present specification and claims functional group X as a small molecule means that the functional group X is in a form that is not bound to the non-electrically conductive film forming copolymer. It does not refer necessarily to its physical size as further described below. In a preferred embodiment functional group Ζ is a beta-ketoester group and X is a dihydropyridine group formed via the Hantzsch reaction. In the Hantzsch reaction 2 equivalents of beta-ketoester are reacted with one equivalent of ammonia and one equivalent of an aldehyde to form the dihydropyridine group. Within this preferred embodiment exemplary sources of Ζ include but are not limited to acetoacetoxyethyl methacrylate and acrylic copolymers made there from, ethylacetoacetate, t-butylacetoacetate, and acetoacetate functional polymers/oligomers such as K-Flcx ΧΜ-Β301 and K-Flex 7301 both from King Industries. The K-Flex polymers are low viscosity acetoacetate resins per the manufacturer. Within this preferred embodiment, any aldehyde conforming to the general structure L-CHO can be used wherein L is any substituent attached to the aldehyde function. Exemplary aldehydes include, by way of example only, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, cinnamaldehyde, glucose, vanillin, glyoxalic acid and salicylaldehyde. Methods for formation of pyridine functional group X are well known in the art and include, by way of example only, polymerization of vinyl-pyridine or oxidation/dehydrogenation of a dihydropyridine functional group X. [00022] In another preferred embodiment, Ζ is an acetoacetate group and functional group X is a pyrrole formed by reaction of a beta-ketoester group with an alpha-amino ketone via the Knorr pyrrole synthesis reaction. In another preferred embodiment Ζ is either a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound, or a primary amine and functional group X is a pyrrole formed via the Paal-Knorr Synthesis reaction. In another preferred embodiment Ζ is either a substituted 1,2-dicarbonyl compound, or a primary amine and functional group X is an imidazole formed by reaction of the 1,2-dicarbonyl compound with ammonia and aldehyde to form an unsubstituted imidazole or reaction of a 1,2 dicarbonyl compound with a primary amine and ammonia, which is an adaptation of the Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis, to form a substituted imidazole. Particularly preferred embodiments are those in which a film forming non-conductive polymer comprising group Ζ is first prepared after which Ζ is converted to functional group X in a subsequent derivation reaction. [00023] In one embodiment Ζ is an endgroup on a small molecule which upon undergoing the derivative reaction to form functional group X becomes less hydrophilic. During the derivative reaction, the small molecule bearing functional group X partitions by phase transfer into the organic phase of a latex or aqueous dispersion of the non-electrically conductive film forming polymer. Exemplary small molecules bearing Ζ are ethylacetoacetate and t-butylacetoacetate which can be converted to small molecule dihydropyridines as functional group X via the Hantzsch reaction using a latex or aqueous polymer dispersion as a reaction medium. [00024] However incorporated into the coating composition, the functional group X is preferably present in an amount of from 0.001 to 0.5; more preferably from 0.005 to 0.20; and most preferably from an amount of from 0.01 to 0.05 moles of functional group X per kilogram of dried coating composition. The dried coating composition is achieved after the coating composition is applied to the metal substrate and dried in place. The functional group X ultimately binds the metallate anion via ion pairing. This binding may occur at the time of formation of the coating composition or after drying of the coating composition in place on the substrate. In one embodiment the metal substrate is coated with a solution containing the copolymer including the functional group X either bound to the copolymer, carried within an aqueous dispersion or emulsion of the film forming copolymer, or as a part of the solution. Then the coating composition is completed by immersing the substrate with copolymer and functional group X into an aqueous solution containing the metallate anion. The coating composition is then dried in place to form the final coated substrate. In another embodiment a phase stable mixture of the non-electrically conductive film forming copolymer, functional group X, either bound to the copolymer or free, and the metallate anion is created. The phase stable coating composition is then applied to the substrate and dried in place in a single operation. [00025] A preferred formula for functional group X wherein it is a dihydropyridine is given below in formula (I) wherein, A and Ε are independently Ci to C4 alkyl groups; Β and D are independently COORi, wherein Ri is a linear or branched Ci to C12 hydrocarbon or a polymer chain; F1 is Hydrogen; and F2 is L, derived from an aldehyde L-CHO. The polymer chain can either be the non-electrically conductive film forming copolymer or any other polymer. [00026] A preferred formula for a functional group X wherein it is a pyridine is given below in formula (II), wherein A and Ε are independently Hydrogen, Ci to C4 alkyl groups, or a polymer chain; Β and D are independently Hydrogen or COORi, wherein Ri is a linear or branched chain Ci to C12 hydrocarbon or a polymer chain; and F2 is L, derived from an aldehyde L-CHO or a polymer chain. The polymer chain can either be the non-electrically conductive film forming copolymer or any other polymer. (Π) [00027] A preferred formula for a functional group X wherein it is a pyrrole is given below in formula (III), wherein I is Hydrogen, Ri or COORi, where Ri is a linear or branched Ci to C12 hydrocarbon or a polymer chain; J is a Ci to C4 alkyl group; Κ is Hydrogen or a polymer chain, F is Hydrogen, a Ci to C12 linear or branched hydrocarbon; and G is Hydrogen, a Ci to C12 linear or branched hydrocarbon or a polymer chain. The polymer chain can either be the non-electrically conductive film forming copolymer or any other polymer. (Ill) [00028] A preferred formula for a functional group X wherein it is an imidazole is given below in formula (IV), wherein I is a polymer chain, Hydrogen or a Ci to Cu linear or branched hydrocarbon; J is Hydrogen or L derived from an aldehyde L-CHO, F and G are independently Hydrogen or a Ci to C12 linear or branched hydrocarbon. The polymer chain can either be the non-electrically conductive film forming copolymer or any other polymer. (IV) [00029] Methods for applying the dry in place coating compositions of the present invention are known in the art and include dry in place coating methods, spray application, roll coating, dip or bath coating, drawbar coating and other processes known to those of skill in the art. Drying may be achieved under any number of conditions, however application of heat is generally preferred. In a preferred embodiment application is made by roll coating. The coating compositions of the present invention are preferably applied at a level of from 75 to 600 milligrams per square foot; more preferably at a level of from 100 to 400 milligrams per square foot; and most preferably at a level of from 120 to 200 milligrams per square foot. The applied coatings are preferably dried using a peak metal temperature of from 43 °C to 150°C; more preferably from 70°C to 130°C; and most preferably from 90°C to 110°C. [00030] The metallate anions that find use in the present invention include metallates of molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium, zirconium, chromium or mixtures thereof. Non-limiting exemplary sources for the metallate anions include ammonium heptamolybdate, tungstic acid and its salts, vanadium pentoxide, ammonium vanadate, vanadyl sulfate, fluorozirconic acid and its salts, chromium trioxide or mixtures thereof. The metallate anions are preferably present in the coating composition in an amount of from 0.001 to 1.500; more preferably in an amount of from 0.01 to 1.25; and most preferably in an amount of from 0.1 to 1.0 moles of metal element per kilogram dried coating composition. [00031] As noted above the metallate anion is ion pair bonded to the functional group X at a nitrogen in the functional group X within the applied coating composition. For ion pairing to occur, the nitrogen must be in cationic form. Any number of acid sources can be utilized to provide a cation of functional group X. Exemplary proton sources are polymeric acid sources such as polymers with carboxyl functionality or phosphorus-based or sulfur-based acids groups. Such acid functional groups can be imparted to a polymer by ways known in the art. Acid groups can be imparted to the polymer by acid functional monomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, phosphorus-based acid monomers such as Polysurf HP, Ebecryl 168 or Ebecryl 170 and sulfur-based acid monomers such as sulfoethylmethacrylate. Polysurf HP is a mixture of polymerizable propenoic acid phosphonyoxy esters per the manufacturer ADD APT Chemicals BV. The Ebecryl 168 and 170 are available from Cytec Industries and are methacrylated acidic derivatives. In other cases, acidic endgroups associated with many conventional acrylic initiators such as ammonium persulfate may be sufficient to provide a proton for X. Alternatively, non-polymeric acid sources may be used. In a preferred embodiment, the coating composition prior to application and drying comprises a volatile base such as ammonia such that ion pairing of the nitrogen of functional group X to the metallate anion can be delayed until the time of application of the coating composition. After ion pairing has occurred, it is theorized that the increase in localized pH accompanying corrosion leads to release of the anion from the nitrogen of the functional group X. The release behavior of the nitrogen of the functional group X is governed by the pKa of the nitrogen of functional group X. Preferred functional groups constituting X may vary significantly in pKa however in preferred embodiments pKa generally falls between 4 and 11 and all ranges between. [00032] Coating compositions of the present invention may also comprise other optional components such as crosslinkers, pH modifiers, other non-electrically conductive polymeric film formers, or coating additives. In a preferred embodiment, an aqueous coating composition prior to application has a pH between 8 and 11, preferably around pH 10 wherein ammonia is used as a pH modifier and ammonium zirconium carbonate is utilized as a crosslinker. Additives can include wetting agents, slip aids, reducing agents, coalescing aids or other commonplace additives for coatings. [00033] The present invention will now be illustrated in a series of examples. The examples are illustrative of the invention and not intended to limit the invention or its embodiments. A first latex non-electrically conducting film forming copolymer, Example 1, was formed as detailed below in Table 1.

Rhodapon L22 is an anionic surfactant of ammonium lauryl sulfate available from Rhodia. It was heated to and maintained at 80° C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Parts Β1 and Β2 were mixed separately to form uniform clear solutions. Tergital 15-S-20 is a non-ionic surfactant of secondary alcohol ethoxylate available from Dow Chemical, Polysurf HP is a surfactant that is a mix of polymerizable propenoic acid phosphonyoxy esters and is available from ADD APT Chemicals BV. Β1 and Β2 were mixed together to form pre-emulsion Β. An amount of 5% of the pre-emulsion Β and 25% of part C were charged to the flask and maintained at 80° C. After 15 minutes the remainder of pre-emulsion Β and part C were added at a constant rate to the flask over a period of 3 hours after which part Η was used to flush the pre-emulsion addition pump into the flask. The flask contents were then cooled to 70° C at which time part F was added to the flask. Then parts D and Ε were added to the flask over a period of 30 minutes, after which the mixture was maintained at 70° C for a period of 1 hour. The mixture was cooled to 40° C at which time part G was added. The resulting latex, Example 1, had a solids content of 37.2%, a pH of 7.1 , and particle size of 132 nanometers. [00035] A series of latex non-electrically conducting film forming copolymers, Examples 2Α to 2D, having dihydropyridine functional groups X were prepared via the Hantzsch reaction using the latex of Example 1 as detailed in Table 2 below. The selected aldehydes were added in the weight ratios designated and the mixtures were placed in sealed containers in an oven set at 45° C for 24 hours.

Bacote 20 is an aqueous alkaline stabilized solution of ammonium zirconium carbonate containing anionic hydroxylated zirconium polymers. It is available from Magnesium Elcktron, Inc. and it provides approximately 20% wgt/wgt of ZrC>2. The components were mixed together in the order listed. In these examples the dihydropyridine functional groups are found both on the film forming copolymers as pendant groups and in crosslinking bridges that crosslink the copolymers. Comparative 3Α has no dihydropyridine functional group X and serves as a control composition.

Comparative Example 4 [00038] As a comparison clean hot-dipped galvanized panels were coated with Ρ3000Β a commercial chrome-based thin-organic passivate available from Henkel Corporation. The Ρ3000Β was applied to the panels by drawbar and dried by heating to a peak metal temperature of 93° C yielding a dry coating weight of 175 + 25 mg/ft2. [00039] Panels coated with coating compositions Examples 3Α to 3Ε and Comparative Example 4 were placed in a Neutral Salt Spray (NSS) cabinet and corrosion tested per ASTM Β117. Corrosion was measured as a % of total facerust as a function of time. The % corrosion was determined from the average of 3 test panels for each coating composition. The results of the tests after 336 and 504 hours of NSS are reported below in Table 4.

Compared to the Ρ3000Β chrome-based coating of Comparative Example 4 the coating compositions prepared according to the present invention faired very well and in some cases exceeded the protection offered by this chrome-based coating. The vanadium-based inhibiting anion alone was not able to provide significant protection on its own.

Coated panels coated with Examples 19Α and 19Β and Comparative Example 4, described above, were placed in a Neutral Salt Spray cabinet and tested as described above. The extent of corrosion was measured as a % of total facerust as a function of time and three panels under each condition and time point were averaged to generate the results shown in Table 20 below.

The results show that the present invention is significantly better at preventing corrosion than a commercially available conventional chrome treatment. The benefit of the present invention is expected to extend to well beyond 672 hours of NSS testing. [00070] To show the lack of electrical conductivity of copolymers prepared according to the present invention versus a typical electrically conductive copolymer an electrically conductive coating was prepared using electrically conductive copolymer Example 20. To form the conductive copolymer, Example 20, 10 parts of n-methylpyrrolidone were combined with 1.1 parts Panipol F, an acid doped emeraldine form of polyaniline. The materials were mixed with heating to form a liquid coating composition which was applied to clean hot-dipped galvanized substrate by drawbar and dried by heating for 10 minutes at a temperature of 185°C. Dry coating weight was measured to be 206 mg/ft2. Resistivity of the applied coatings was measured using a Loresta-EP resistivity meter equipped with a Loresta probe 8000-20-01. 12 replicate measurements were made for each panel and averaged. Similar measurements were taken of panels coated as described above with Examples 3Β to 3Ε which include dihydropyridine functional group X and vanadium pentaoxide as the metallate anion. The results are shown below in Table 21. The results demonstrate that the non-electrically conductive copolymers of the invention provide coatings which are insulators as compared to conductive coatings based on inherently conductive polymers such as Example 20.
