FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to food compositions that can be provided in a ready-to-eat form or incorporated into a bar, chew, paste, or filling. The food compositions of the invention have a water activity of less than about 0.85 water activity (aw). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Various nutritional supplements can be used to feed or nourish undernourished patients (e.g. moderate or severe acute malnutrition). Historically, these patients were nourished with powdered foods which were dissolved in water before consumption. These foods have been prepared from powdered milk products mixed with carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and lipids. However, these products can be difficult to feed because they are prepared by diluting in water and can require heating. Further, the water used for diluting can be a source of bacterial contamination or can be otherwise contaminated and may cause additional health problems for the patients. The risk of incorrect feeding and contamination is eliminated by use of food products that are ready-to-use. One approach to overcoming these disadvantages is the use of a ready-to-use food product that does not require additional preparation. These food products must be shelf stable, have the required nutrient density, and be easily consumed and utilized by malnourished patients. There is also a need for a functional food paste that can be used in a variety of food products and is capable of preventing water migration in such food products. Typically, a functional food paste can be shaped, extruded, ground, or heated in the process of making a food product. Frequently the functional food paste looses its shape and slumps, bulges, oozes, or the fat separates during processing and/or storage.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention is directed to a food composition having at least 15 wt.% protein based on the total weight of the composition, a low water activity. The food composition can have less than 4.5 wt.% peanut flour or peanut butter based on the total weight of the composition. The food composition can be used as a functional food paste or a component in various food products. Advantageously, the food composition has a desirable water activity level to be packaged as a ready-to-eat paste having desirable shelf stability. The functional food paste can be a shelf stable food paste with or without water. The food composition of the invention comprises at least about 15 wt.% protein based on the total weight of the composition, carbohydrate, and fat. The composition has a water activity of less than about 0.85 aw when measured at 25°C and a shelf-life at 25°C of at least 6 months, a shelf-life at 25°C of at least 12 months, a shelf-life at 25°C of at least 24 months. In various embodiments, the food composition comprises at least about 3 wt.% humectant based on the total weight of the composition. Protein The food composition of the invention contains at least about 15 wt.% soy protein based on the total weight of the composition. In various embodiments, the food composition contains from about 15 wt.% to about 30 wt.% soy protein based on the total weight of the composition. In some embodiments from about 15 wt.% to about 20 wt.% protein based on the total weight of the composition. The protein used in the composition can be a dairy protein, a wheat protein, a canola protein, a corn protein, a lupin protein, an oat protein, a pea protein, a rice protein, a sorghum protein, an amaranth protein, an arrowroot protein, a barley protein, a buckwheat protein, a cassava protein, a channa (garbanzo or chickpea) protein, a millet protein, a peanut protein, a potato protein, a rye protein, a sunflower protein, a tapioca protein, a triticale protein, a whey protein, an egg protein, a soy protein, a white kidney bean protein, a bamboo extract protein, a meat protein, a fish protein, or a combination thereof. In various preferred embodiments, the protein comprises a soy protein. The vegetable protein compositions described above comprise soy protein. Soybean protein materials which can be used as starting materials are soy flour, soy concentrate, and isolated soy protein (i.e., soy protein isolate). The soy flour, soy concentrate, or isolated soy protein is formed from a soybean starting material which may be soybeans or a soybean derivative. Preferably, the soybean starting material is either soybean cake, soybean chips, soybean meal, soybean flakes, or a mixture of these materials. The soybean cake, chips, meal, or flakes may be formed from soybeans according to conventional procedures in the art, where soybean cake and soybean chips are formed by extraction of part of the oil in soybeans by pressure or solvents, soybean flakes are formed by cracking, heating, and flaking soybeans and reducing the oil content of the soybeans by solvent extraction, and soybean meal is formed by grinding soybean cake, chips, or flakes. Soy flour can be full fat, enzyme-active, toasted or defatted. As these terms are used herein, a full fat soy flour contains ground whole soybeans containing all of the original oil, usually 18% to 20%. This full fat flour can be enzyme-active or it can be heat-processed or toasted to minimize enzyme action. Enzyme-active soy flour is a full fat soy flour that is minimally heat-treated to keep the natural enzyme activity. Defatted soy flour refers to a comminuted form of defatted soybean material, preferably containing less than 1% oil, formed of particles having a size such that the particles can pass through a No. 100 mesh (U.S. Standard) screen. The soy cake, chips, flakes, meal, or mixture of the materials are comminuted into a soy flour using conventional soy grinding processes. Soy flour has a protein content of from about 49% to less than 65% on a moisture free basis (mfb). Preferably the flour is very finely ground, most preferably so that less than about 1% of the flour is retained on a 300 mesh (U.S. Standard) screen. Acceptable soy flours are available from Cargill, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN), Archer Daniels Midland Company (Decatur, IL), or U.S. Soy, LLC (Mattoon, IL). Soy concentrate, as the term is used herein, refers to a soy protein material containing from 65% to less than 90% of soy protein (mfb). Soy concentrate is preferably formed from a commercially available defatted soy flake material from which the oil has been removed by solvent extraction. The soy concentrate is produced by an acid leaching process, an alcohol leaching process, or by an aqueous process. In the acid leaching process, the soy flake material is washed with an aqueous solvent having a pH at about the isoelectric point of soy protein, preferably at a pH of about 4 to about 5, and most preferably at a pH of about 4.4 to about 4.6. The isoelectric wash removes a large amount of water soluble carbohydrates and other water soluble components from the flakes, but removes little of the protein and fiber, thereby forming a soy concentrate. The soy concentrate is dried after the isoelectric wash. In the alcohol leaching process, the soy flake material is washed with an aqueous ethyl alcohol solution wherein ethyl alcohol is present at about 60% by weight. The protein and fiber remain insoluble while the carbohydrate soy sugars of sucrose, stachyose and raffinose are leached from the defatted flakes. The soy soluble sugars in the aqueous alcohol are separated from the insoluble protein and fiber and the insoluble protein and fiber are dried to form the soy concentrate. In the aqueous process, the soy concentrate is typically formed by extracting soy protein and water soluble carbohydrates from defatted soy flakes or soy flour with an alkaline aqueous extractant, pH from about 7.0 to about 7.6, preferably at a pH of about 7.1 to about 7.5, and most preferably at a pH of bout 7.3. The aqueous extract, along with the soluble protein and soluble carbohydrates, is separated from materials that are insoluble in the extract, mainly fiber. The aqueous extract may be dried after the separation or further concentrated by ultrafiltration followed by drying to form the soy concentrate. Acceptable soy concentrates are available from Solae LLC (St. Louis, MO) or Archer Daniels Midland Company. Isolated Soy Protein, as the term is used herein, refers to a soy protein material containing at least 90% protein content, and preferably from about 95% or greater protein content (mfb). Isolated soy proteins are typically formed by extracting soy protein and water soluble carbohydrates from defatted soy flakes or soy flour with an alkaline aqueous extractant. The aqueous extract, along with the soluble protein and soluble carbohydrates, is separated from materials that are insoluble in the extract, mainly fiber. The extract is typically then treated with an acid to adjust the pH of the extract to the isoelectric point of the protein to precipitate the protein from the extract. The precipitated protein is separated from the extract, which retains the soluble carbohydrates, and is dried after being adjusted to a neutral pH or is dried without any pH adjustment. Acceptable soy isolates are available from Solae, LLC or Archer Daniels Midland Company. In various embodiments, the food composition can comprise less than 4.5 wt.% peanut flour or peanut butter based on the total weight of the composition. In other embodiments, no detectable amount of peanut flour or peanut butter is included. Moisture The moisture content of the food composition can have an effect on the texture of the food composition and can be adjusted so the composition is able to be easily handled and easily digested. Thus, the moisture content of the food composition can be greater than 10 wt.% based on the total weight of the composition. If the moisture content is too high, the composition may have a reduced caloric density. In various embodiments, the moisture content is from about 10 wt.% to about 20 wt.% based on the total weight of the composition. Fat The food composition of the invention also contains fat. The fat content is adjusted depending on the use. In some cases, higher fat compositions can be prepared having from about 10 wt.% to about 40 wt.% fat based on the total weight of the composition. In other instances, lower fat compositions having from about 20 wt.% to about 35 wt.% fat based on the total weight of the composition are desired. Typically, the fat is added to the composition in the form of an oil. The oil provides a source of calories and improves the texture and mouthfeel of the food composition. Further, the oil aids in the functionality of the food composition. The fat can be palm oil, coconut oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, palm kernel oil, olive oil, corn oil, hazelnut oil, linseed oil, rice bran oil, sesame oil, safflower oil, canola oil, flax seed oil, soybean oil, blubber, cod liver oil, lard pork fat, beef tallow, chicken fat, or a combination thereof. In other embodiments, the fat can be palm oil, coconut oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, palm kernel oil, olive oil, corn oil, hazelnut oil, linseed oil, rice bran oil, sesame oil, safflower oil, canola oil, flax seed oil, soybean oil, or a combination thereof. These oils may be partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated. In various preferred embodiments, the fat comprises soybean oil, palm oil, or combinations thereof. For RUTF compositions, when a partially hydrogenated palm oil is used an emulsifier may not be required. In the various embodiments of the food compositions, when between about 20% to about 50% of the oil is replaced with partially hydrogenated palm oil an emulsifier may not be required. Carbohydrate Carbohydrate is also included in the food composition of the invention. The carbohydrate provides sweetness, calories, and acts as a bulking agent. Some carbohydrates, such as powdered sugar, can also provide a smooth mouthfeel to the composition. The carbohydrate content of the composition can be from about 30 wt.% to about 80 wt.% based on the total weight of the composition. In various embodiments, the carbohydrate composition can be from about 50 wt.% to about 70 wt.% based on the total weight of the composition. The carbohydrate can be a corn syrup solid (CSS), powdered sugar, cane sugar, a maltodextrin, a rye carbohydrate, a barley carbohydrate, a corn carbohydrate, a cassava carbohydrate, an oat carbohydrate, a rice carbohydrate, a millet carbohydrate, a sorghum carbohydrate, a tapioca carbohydrate, or a combination thereof. In various preferred embodiments, the carbohydrate is a corn syrup solid, powdered sugar, or a combination thereof. More Preferably, the carbohydrate is a combination of a corn syrup solid and powdered sugar. Humectant Optionally, a humectant can be added to the food composition. The humectant provides texture to the composition and reduces the water activity of the composition. In the embodiments including a humectant, the humectant content of the food composition is at least about 3 wt.% based on the total weight of the composition. In various embodiments, the humectant content is from about 3 wt.% to about 20 wt.% based on the total weight of the composition. The humectant can be glycerin, maltitol, sorbitol, or a combination thereof. In various preferred embodiments, the humectant comprises glycerin. Emulsifying Agent In some instances, an emulsifying agent is added to the composition to aid in binding the fat and minimize oil separation in the food composition. The emulsifying agent can be the product of an esterification of a diglyceride and glycerol, a lecithin, a monoglyceride or a diglyceride of a fatty acid ester, a monoglyceride of a fatty acid, or a phosphated monoglyceride. The diglyceride source for the product of an esterification of a diglyceride and glycerol can be a palm oil, a rapeseed oil, a soybean oil, a sunflower oil, a lard, a tallow, or a combination thereof. In various preferred embodiments, the emulsifying agent is a Dimodan® HS-KA, Dimodan® Visco-Lo, Dimodan® SO or sodium stearoyl lactylate, or a combination thereof. The Dimodan® emulsifying agents are available from Danisco (Copenhagen, Denmark). Typically, the emulsifying agent is added to the food composition in an amount of 0.3 wt.% to about 1.5 wt.% based on the total weight of the composition; preferably, the emulsifying agent is added to the food composition in an amount of about 0.8 wt.% based on the total weight of the composition. Flavoring Agent or Preservative Optionally, a flavoring agent or preservative can be added to the food composition to impart or maintain a particular flavor over the shelf-life of the composition. Typically, a salt or salt-like flavor enhancer can be added to enhance flavor. The salt or salt-like flavor enhancer can be added in the form of flour salt, sea salt, iodized salt, sodium benzoate, benzoic acid, sodium nitrate, sulfur dioxide, sodium sorbate, potassium sorbate, propionic acid, sorbic acid, a sulfite, sodium erythorbate, erythorbic acid, sodium diacetate, sodium succinate, grape seed extract, pine bark extract, apple extract, a tea propylphenol, succinic acid, ascorbic acid, parabens, sodium dehydroacetate, or a combination thereof. In various embodiments, the salt comprises flour salt. Further, one skilled in the art can use any flavoring agent that can provide a specific flavor profile for the intended end use of the food composition. For example but not limited to, lemon juice, ground ginger, cocoa, peanut butter flavor, vanilla, cheese, or combinations thereof can be added to the food composition depending on the intended end use application. The flavoring agents are typically added at a level of between about 0.05 wt.% to about 5 wt.% based on the total weight of the composition depending on the agent. However, one skilled in the art can use whatever level is required for the end use application. In other embodiments, an optional flavoring agent that can provide a savory flavor profile can be added to the food composition. For example, meat or spice flavors can be included. Vitamins and Minerals For various ready-to-eat food compositions, RUTFs and RUSFs, the vitamin and mineral content needed to provide a standard therapeutic food is detailed in Table 1. For other applications, one skilled in the art can determine the required fortification level for the particular use. Table 1.

Qualitatively, water activity is a measure of unbound, free water in a system that is available to support biological and chemical reactions (see Food Science, by Norman N. Potter, Third Edition, A.V.I., pp. 314-316 (1978)). Since water activity is not the same as absolute water content, two foods with the same water content can have very different water activities. Stated another way, the water activity level depends on the degree to which water is free or otherwise bound to food constituents. When a food is in moisture equilibrium with its environment, the water activity of the food will be quantitatively equal to the relative humidity in the head space of the container divided by 100. In general, as the water activity of a food product increases, its shelf life decreases. That is, the food product becomes more susceptible to mold, fungus, and bacterial growth as the water activity increases. Typically, the food composition has a shelf-life at 25°C of at least 6, 12, 18, 24, or more months. Preferably, the food composition has a shelf-life at 25°C of at least 24 months. In various embodiments, the food composition has a peanut flour or peanut butter content less than about 4.5 wt.%, 4 wt.%, 3.5 wt.%, 3 wt.%, 2.5 wt.%, 2 wt.%, 1.5 wt.%, 1 wt.%, 0.5 wt.%, 0.3 wt.% or less based on the total weight of the composition, including a composition free of any detectable amount of peanut flour or peanut butter, or a composition free of peanut flour or peanut butter, based on the total weight of the composition. PDCAAS The Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) is a method for evaluation of protein quality that is described in Protein Quality Evaluation, Food and Nutrition Paper 51, Rome, Italy: FAO/W HO, 1991, p 35. To calculate a PDCAAS value, a food is analyzed for proximate and amino acid composition. A protein digestibility value is obtained from a data base or determined by the rat balance method. An amino acid score is determined as follows: Amino Acid Score=mg of essential amino acid in1.0g test proteinmg of essential amino acid in1.0g reference pattern The PDCAAS is then calculated by multiplying the lowest amino acid score x true protein digestibility: PDCAAS=Lowest Amino Acid Score×True Digestibility Scores above 1.00 are considered as 1.00. Thus, for the food compositions described herein where the only source of protein is Supro® isolated soy protein, which has a Lowest Amino Acid Score of 1.04 and a True Digestibility of 97%, the PDCAAS is 1.00. Osmolality The osmolality of the food compositions described herein is preferably less than about 300 mOsm/kg, 275 mOsm/kg, 250 mOsm/kg, 240 mOsm/kg, 230 mOsm/kg, 220 mOsm/kg, 210 mOsm/kg, 200 mOsm/kg, or less. These osmolality values provide a food composition appropriate for feeding severe acute malnourished patients. When the RUTF is all soy protein, the osmolality can be between about 280 mOsm/kg to about 290 mOsm/kg. Process The food composition can be prepared by mixing the fat with the emulsifying agent to form a stable mixture. If used, water, humectant, flavoring agent, and coloring agent are added to the stable mixture at this point. The remaining components are added in any order (i.e., protein, carbohydrate, and any further optional components) with further mixing. In forming the stable mixture, the fat and the emulsifying agent are mixed and optionally, the mixture is heated depending on the requirements of the particular emulsifying agent. For example, Dimodan® HS-KA is mixed with the fat and heated to less than 52°C (125°F), while Dimodan® Visco-Lo and Dimodan® SO are mixed with the fat and added to the composition without additional heat. Further, sodium stearoyl lactylate is mixed with the water or fat and heated to less than 52°C (125°F). Once the stable mixture is formed, the water, humectant, flavoring agents, and coloring agents are added to the mixture if desired. The rest of the ingredients (e.g., protein, carbohydrates, and any further optional ingredients) are added to the stable mixture in a paddle type mixer. The mixture is blended on low speed until a batter or dough consistency is obtained. The speed is then increased to high shear mixing for an appropriate time. The mixer is periodically stopped and the mixture is scraped from the sides of the container. Food Applications The food composition described herein can be formulated or incorporated into various food products. For example, the food composition can be in the form of a ready-to-eat paste, a chew, a confection, or a filling. Further, the food composition can be incorporated into a ready-to-eat paste, a chew, filling or bar, or used as minimize moisture in a food product having components with differing moisture contents. Various other food products known in the art can be developed as well. The food application of the present invention may be sweet or savory. They are formed by blending the fat, emulsifier, optional water; a carbohydrate containing material containing at least one carbohydrate; optional flavor ingredients such as cocoa powder, peanut flavor, vanilla, chocolate, lemon, caramel, cheese, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, ginger, paprika, ground chilies, pepper; and any other optional, desired ingredients such as humectant, vitamins and minerals into a dough. The dough is then formed into desired shapes by extrusion or sheeting and cutting according to conventional processes for extruding or sheeting and cutting. The dough may be heated during the process of forming, shaping, or extruding. If desired, the formed product may then be enrobed in a coating. Chews may be sweet or savory. They can be formed into any shape desired including small squares, short or long cylinders, or strips. Fillings may be sweet or savory.

Preferably the flour is very finely ground, most preferably so that less than about 1% of the flour is retained on a 300 mesh (U.S. Standard) screen. Isolated Soy Protein. The term "isolated soy protein" as used herein is a soy material having a protein content of at least about 90% soy protein on a moisture free basis. An isolated soy protein is formed from soybeans by removing the hull and germ of the soybean from the cotyledon, flaking or grinding the cotyledon and removing oil from the flaked or ground cotyledon, separating the soy protein and carbohydrates of the cotyledon from the cotyledon fiber, and subsequently separating the soy protein from the carbohydrates. Having described the invention in detail, it will be apparent that modifications and variations are possible without departing from the scope of the invention defined in the appended claims. EXAMPLES The following non-limiting examples are provided to further illustrate the present invention. Materials for all examples.

The glycerin was available as 'Soapers choice' Vegetable glycerin USP from Columbus Foods (Des Plaines, IL). The ground ginger was available from ACH Food Companies Inc. (Memphis, TN). Example 1: RUSF Formulations Peanut Butter Type, Ginger Lemon Type, and Chocolate Type The formulations listed in Table 2 were prepared by the following process. The soybean oil was mixed with the Dimodan® HS-KA and heated to 52°C (125°F). Once the soybean oil and Dimodan® HS-KA were mixed, the water, glycerin, and flavoring agents were added to the mixture followed by blending to form a stable mixture. The rest of the ingredients (e.g., Supro® 661, corn syrup solids, and powdered sugar) were added to the stable mixture in a paddle mixer. The mixture was blended on low speed until a batter or dough consistency was obtained. The speed was then increased to high shear mixing for 15 minutes. The mixer was stopped every 5 minutes and the mixture was scraped from the sides of the container before mixing was continued. The food compositions so formed had the properties shown in Table 3.

Peanut, Nat. WONF and Mono&Di, Dimodan® Visco-Lo were added to the oil and the oil mixture was heated to 43°C (110°F). Brown Lake Blend R #09195 was added to the oil mixture and the mixture was mixed for 3 minutes. Dry ingredients were added to the fat mixture in a paddle mixer. The mixture was blended on low speed until a batter or dough consistency was seen. The speed was increased to obtain high shear mixing for 15 minutes. The paddle mixer was set on the highest speed setting and was controlled using a variable speed transformer. Every 5 minutes the mixer was stopped and the sides of the container were scraped down. The sample was then transferred to a suitable container for storage.

The difference between the formulation process was that sodium stearoyl lactylate was substituted for the Dimodan® HS-KA (i.e., the emulsifying agent). Additionally one-half the water (100g) was heated to 66°C (150ºF) prior to adding the SSL with stirring to the heated water. The remaining ingredients were added to the paddle mixer and mixed slowly to blend. The aqueous SSL was added to the mix in the paddle mixture. The mixture was blended on low speed until a batter or dough consistency was obtained. The speed was then increased to high shear mixing for 15 minutes. The mixer was stopped every 5 minutes and the mixture was scraped from the sides of the container before mixing was continued.
