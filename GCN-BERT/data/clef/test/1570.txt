The eighth step
To a solution of Compound 80 (300mg, 0.781mmol) in dichloromethane (3 mL) were added pyridine (0.252mL, 3.12mmol) and methanesulfonyl chloride (0.122mL, 1.56mmol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature 3.5 hours. The reaction mixture was extracted with chloroform after addition of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (chloroform-methanol) to yield Compound 81 (300 mg, yield 83%).
