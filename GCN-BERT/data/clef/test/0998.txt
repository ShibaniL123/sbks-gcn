FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to the field of commodes, and more particularly, to a commode with improved safety and convenience features. BACKGROUND As the U.S. population ages, assistive devices become increasingly necessary for both ailing individuals and their caregivers. Urination and defecation are two sensitive bodily functions that must be accommodated efficiently and hygienically by assistive devices without compromising user comfort and safety. Numerous prior art devices attempt to accommodate these functions. Diapers and catheterization, while efficient and convenient, can cause pain and infections and are often seen as humiliating by the user. Bedpans and portable urinals are also convenient, but their small size may make them difficult for a user to utilize adequately and accurately. Conventional toilets are often located an unmanageable distance from the user, particularly if the user is bedridden or unable to move freely. Many toilets are located too low to the ground to use without significant assistance. Bedside commodes, including the popular 3-in-1 commodes, permit users to eliminate waste more conveniently, because these commodes do not require a plumbing connection and can be placed in close proximity to a user. The seat frame is high enough to permit easy seating and rising for the user and can also be used as a shower assistive device. The waste receptacle can be emptied and cleaned when the commode is not in use and no one is seated on the seat frame. The waste receptacle is removed by raising up the seat and lifting out the waste receptacle for emptying and cleaning. However, the bedside commode lacks functionality for dependent commode users who require a caregiver to perform cleaning after urination and defecation. Some examples of dependent users may include individuals who are elderly, post-operative, disabled, handicapped, ill, and/or hospice patients. Dependent commode users may have difficulty walking, standing or sitting, may be physically weak and may lack the dexterity and reach to wipe their own body. One problem with these commodes that is known in the art is that the waste receptacles prevent a caregiver from access to the user's body, requiring the user to stand for cleaning. For infirm users, this may require caregivers to awkwardly and dangerously support the user while the caregiver reaches around to clean them, often leading to inadequate cleaning or a dangerous fall. Due to the poor usability of most bedside commodes for dependent commode uses, both the user and caregiver are at risk of falling, injury and improper wiping that may lead to unhygienic conditions and infections. This wiping process can also create unpleasant feelings and emotions for the user and their caregiver. Loss of privacy, dignity, humiliation and embarrassment are common. Additionally, some models allow the caregiver to slide the waste receptacle into or out of the seat frame, which can pinch the penis and testicles of a seated male user. Some only allow the bucket to be removed from the front, resulting in the user's legs blocking waste receptacle removal. In other models, the slide rail is midway under the commode frame which makes difficult to engage the waste receptacle in the proper location, resulting in human waste splashing on the underside of the commode frame. Still other models lack a direct connection between the commode frame and waste receptacle; misalignment of the waste receptacle can result in waste leaking from the commode and creating unsanitary conditions. There is an unmet need in the art for a commode that allows a caregiver safe access to a user for cleaning. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a commode which allows a caregiver easy access to a user for cleaning after the elimination of bodily wastes. The commode includes a secondary frame and mounting collar that hold a funnel and waste receptacle in place. Once a user has eliminated, they may remain seated on the commode while a caregiver removes the waste receptacle and cleans them.

In alternate embodiments, the number of legs may range from two to eight, the number of crosspieces may range from two to eight and the number of support bars may range from two to eight. In the exemplary and alternate embodiments shown in FIGS. 1a-1e, secondary frame 14 includes at least one vertical support rail 16 and at least one angled rail 17 (see FIGS. 1a and 1d). Depending on the embodiment, secondary frame 14 is mounted either above or below support bars 13a and 13b (see FIGS. 1c and 1e, respectively). Mounting collar 18 is an annular collar, including at least one projection 19 on its outer surface in an alternate embodiment (see FIG. 1d). In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1a, mounting collar 18 is integrated with secondary frame 14 to form an integral component mounted above support bars 13a and 13b. Secondary frame 14 operatively connects to at least one vertical rail 16, which descends from secondary frame 14. Vertical rail 16 in turn connects to at least one angled rail 17. The exemplary embodiment includes two vertical rails 16a and 16b and two angled rails 17a and 17b; alternate embodiments may include between one and eight vertical rails and/or between one and eight angled rails. In still other embodiments, vertical rails 16a and 16b may be operatively connected to a mechanism to raise and lower the waste receptacle 30 below the funnel 20. The measured height of vertical rails 16a and 16b of the exemplary embodiment may vary from one rail to another. In the exemplary embodiment, angled rail 17 includes two separate angled rails 17a and 17b that connect to secondary frame 14 via the vertical rails 16a and 16b. In other embodiments, angled rail 17 may be u-shaped or circular. Angled rail 17 may form an angle of between approximately 0 and 89 degrees with a horizontal plane. As shown in FIG. 1b, another embodiment of secondary frame 14 is a square planar element with a central opening. In various other embodiments, secondary frame 14 is a planar element that is round, rectangular or u-shaped with a central opening. The perimeter of the opening optionally includes at least one notch 15 that interacts with at least one projection 19 to enable secondary frame 14 to connect to mounting collar 18. The u-shaped embodiment of secondary frame 14 is slidably connectable to mounting collar 18. The embodiment of FIG. 1b includes four notches 15a-15d. In alternate embodiments, notch 15 and projection 19 may be replaced by at least one other physical connection. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1c, mounting collar 18 and secondary frame 14 are connected and placed over support bars 13a and 13b. A funnel 20 is then inserted through an aperture in mounting collar 18 and fills any gap between the horizontal support bars 13a and 13b, and the top of waste receptacle 30. In alternate embodiments, mounting collar 18 and funnel 20 are integrated into a single component. As shown in FIG. 1d, in other embodiments secondary frame 14 is mounted below support bars 13a and 13b. Mounting collar 18 is placed over support bars 13a and 13b and connects to secondary frame 14 to keep secondary frame 14 in place. As above, mounting collar 18 connects to secondary frame 14 via interaction between the respective projection 19 and notch 15. In alternate embodiments, notch 15 may be replaced by at least one other physical connection. In the embodiment of FIG. 1c, funnel 20 has the shape of a hollow, approximately conical section. In various other embodiments, funnel 20 may have a different shape such as, but not limited to a hollow, approximately pyramidal section; the aforementioned sections may have round, oval, square or rectangular cross-sections. Funnel 20 includes a top rim 22, a first sidewall 24, a second sidewall 26, and a bottom rim 28. In use, funnel 20 channels waste from top rim 22 into waste receptacle 30, preventing waste from leaking out of commode 100. First sidewall 24 and second sidewall 26 descend from top rim 22. The measured height of the sidewalls can vary from one side to another. First sidewall 24 has a maximum height measurement equal to or less than the maximum height measurement of second sidewall 26. Second sidewall 26 has a minimum height measurement equal to or greater than the minimum height measurement of second sidewall 26. The transition from first sidewall 24 to second sidewall 26 is smooth. In certain embodiments, first sidewall 24 has a minimum height measurement of about two inches from top rim 22 to bottom rim 28 while second sidewall 26 has a maximum height measurement of about four to about six inches from top rim 22 to bottom rim 28. In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIGS. 1a and 4, vertical rail 16a has a minimum height measurement equal to or greater than first sidewall 24, while vertical rail 16b has a minimum height equal to or greater than second sidewall 26. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1c and 4, first sidewall 24 is located in the rear of funnel 20, enabling a caregiver to clean a user while the user remains seated. In other contemplated embodiments, first sidewall 24 may be located at the front or side of funnel 20 to enable access from different directions. Still other contemplated embodiments may include more than one first sidewall 24 and/or more than one second sidewall 26. Bottom rim 28 terminates both first sidewall 24 and second sidewall 26. To prevent possible injury to a caregiver, bottom rim 28 has a smoothly rounded finish, which may include a flared portion or a flange. In one embodiment, due to the possible height difference between first sidewall 24 and second sidewall 26, a plane formed by bottom rim 28 intersects a plane formed by top rim 22. In an alternate embodiment with no height difference between first sidewall 24 and second sidewall 26, a plane formed by bottom rim 28 is parallel to a plane formed by top rim 22. In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1a, waste receptacle 30 is an open, approximately cylindrical container, similar to a bucket. In other embodiments, waste receptacle may have, but is not limited to an approximately conical or cuboid configuration. In still other embodiments, waste receptacle 30 is a disposable collection device similar to a bag. In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1a, waste receptacle 30 is held in place by angled rail 17. A user inserts waste receptacle 30 into commode 100 at an angle and continues insertion until waste receptacle 30 is located atop angled rail 17 and directly below mounting collar 18 and funnel 20. Reversing the process removes waste receptacle 30. In alternate embodiments, waste receptacle 30 is inserted vertically by a user or simply placed on the floor below funnel 20. In still other embodiments, waste receptacle 30 may be operatively connected to a separate holder below funnel 20 or raised and lowered by use of a mechanism. Support frame 10, funnel 20 and waste receptacle 30 may be constructed out of a material that is impermeable to solid and liquid waste, such as metal, polymer, or any combination of both. This material may be biodegradable or otherwise disposable. In one contemplated embodiment, all parts of support frame 10, funnel 20 and waste receptacle 30 are polymer. In another contemplated embodiment, support frame 10 is metal while funnel 20 and waste receptacle 30 are polymer. In still another contemplated embodiment, legs 11a-11d, crosspieces 12a, 12b and support bars 13a, 13b are metal while mounting collar 18, funnel 20 and waste receptacle 30 are made from a disposable polymer.
