rac-(4R,6S,7R)-7-benzyl 4-tert-butyl 6-phenyl-5-azaspiro[2.4]heptane-4,7-dicarboxylate
To a mixture of (E)-tert-butyl 2-(benzylideneamino)acetate (Core 1A, 1.966 g, 7.17 mmol) and lithium bromide (0.747 g, 8.61 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) at −70° C. were added benzyl 2-cyclopropylideneacetate (1.8 g, 7.17 mmol) and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (1.62 mL, 10.76 mmol). After the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at −78° C., the mixture was warmed to 0° C. for 45 minutes and then at 25° C. for 2 hours. The reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl (10 mL) and water (10 mL). The mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 (30 mL). The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by preparative HPLC (Instrument: Gilson 281; Column: Xbridge™ 21.2*250 mm c18, 10 um; Mobile Phase: A: water (10 mmol/L NH4HCO3) B: acetonitrile; gradient: 55-65% B in 10 minutes, stop at 15 minutes; flow rate (mL/minute) 25.00; detective wavelength (nm) 214) to provide the title compound (251 mg, 0.616 mmol, 8.59% yield).
