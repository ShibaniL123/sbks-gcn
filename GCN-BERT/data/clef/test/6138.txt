3-((2S)-1-((2S)-1-(1-((R)-1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-6-yl)-2-methylpiperidin-4-yl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)propanoic acid 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate
Step 1. (S)-1-(1-((R)-1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-6-yl)-2-methylpiperidin-4-one
To (S)-2-methylpiperidin-4-one hydrochloride (250 mg, 1.67 mmol) and (R)-6-chloro-1-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine (627 mg, 1.84 mmol, 1.1 equiv) in DMSO (4.2 mL) was added N,N-diisopropylethylamine (1.0 mL, 3.5 equiv). The reaction mixture was heated to 120° C. for 4 h before being cooled to room temperature and poured into ethyl acetate (50 mL) and washed with water (50 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (2×25 mL) and the combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, 0 to 20% methanol in dichloromethane) to afford the intermediate ketone as a 1.5:1 mixture of diastereomers (104 mg, 15% yield).
