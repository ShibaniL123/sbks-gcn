1-(5-bromobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-amine
1-(5-bromobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-one 76b (3.1 g, 12.249 mmol), ammonium acetate (9.4 g, 122.486 mmol) and sodium acetate (1 g, 12.249 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of methanol, then sodium cyanoborohydride (1.15 g, 18.374 mmol) was added, and 30 drops of acetic acid was added dropwiase. After stirring 3 hours, the reaction was stopped. Water was added, then the reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate three times. The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatogarphy with elution system A to obtain the title compound 1-(5-bromobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-amine 76c (1.2 g, yield 39%) as a yellow oil.
