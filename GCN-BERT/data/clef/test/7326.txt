The present invention discloses synthetic fusion gene comprising hexl and poxl genes, their process of preparation, polypeptide(s) encoded by the same and its use thereof for biological pre-treatment of biomass for the production of biodiesel. The invention further discloses that the synthetic fusion gene was constructed using bioinformatics tools to help complete hydrolysis of lignocelluloses of Laila paddy into glucose for the production of biodiesel from (husk/straw) of Laila paddy.

In another aspect, the disclosure provides a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2. It further describes the polynucleotide, capable of encoding a polypeptide, wherein the polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. In further discloses that, the polynucleotide comprising SEQ ID NO: 2 is obtained from hexl and poxl gene.

The invention further provides a method of biological pre-treatment for biofuel production, wherein the polynucleotide comprising SEQ ID NO: 2 is included in an expression cassette and/or cloned into a suitable expression vector by standard molecular cloning techniques. The expression cassette or vector is introduced into a suitable expression host cell, which then expresses the corresponding polypeptide comprising SEQ ID NO: 1. It further discloses the method of biological pre-treatment for biofuel production, wherein the polypeptide is capable of hydrolysing lignocellulosic biomass. The present invention solves the long standing need of pure biological treatment, removing the need of any additional physical or chemical pre-treatment step. Further, since polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 is a pure biological agent there is no hazard to the environment. The present invention, also provides quick and cheaper method of pre-treatment of biomass as nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 can be replicated and can be used two or more times. In an embodiment, the present invention arranges synthetic fusion gene to help complete hydrolysis of lignocelluloses of Laila paddy into glucose for production of biodiesel from hust/straw of laila paddy. The invention arranges Hex 1 and Poxl. Hexl is a fungi which is mainly used for hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicelluloses in pretreatment. Poxl is a mushroom which is used to break down lignin in lignocelluloses. The invention joins Hexl and Poxl together by arranging their cDNA nucleotides to construct new synthetic fusion gene. In another embodiment, end codon of Tricoderma recei (hexl) is spliced and start codon of pleurotus sojar caju (poxl) is attached to it by synthetic arrangement of nucleotides. Pleurotus sojar cajus (poxl) stop codon act as end codons for both genes. Therefore, fusion gene work as a single gene having both properties of hex 1 and Pox 1. For any Production of Biodiesel / micro diesel from ligno cellulose (Cellulose, hemicellulose & lignin) it is necessary to do a pre-treatment. However, no additional pretreatment process is required when novel fusion gene is used and fermentation step can be carried out without pretreatment. Synthetic fusion gene can be placed in same plasmid along with other gene used for production of biodiesel. A Pre-treatment is a phase in which the lignocelluloses materials such as wood or straw is amenable to hydrolysis. Pre-treatment technique has been generally divided into physical, chemical and biological. Physical Treatment includes Milling and Grinding, Chemical Treatment includes Using Acids or alkali, and Biological Treatment includes mostly using Rot Fungi in combination with Physical treatment. However using the synthetic gene there is no need for a pre-treatment as the fusion gene is placed in the same plasmid along with biodiesel producing gene. Hence, hydrolysis of ligno cellulose takes place along with biodiesel production during fermentation. Generally lignocelluloses has to undergo first a Combined pretreatment (Physical, Chemical, and an expensive Enzymatic treatment) prior to fermentation process. However the pretreatment does not break the lignin or through some enzymes only partial breakdown of lignin is achieved. Thus a major part of lignin remain intact which is also a carbon source that is wasted. The present invention is a one step process in which invitro enzymatic pretreatment resulting from fusion gene hexlpoxl & fermentation takes place in the same medium. Also complete breakdown of lignin is achieved thereby increasing the production of biodiesel as all sources of carbon from lignocelluloses are utilized. In another embodiment, Aerobic Fermentation was used. Fermentation flask was immersed in a temperature controlled water bath maintained at 37 °C and stirred at 250- 280 rpm for 24 hours. pH was maintained within the range of 6.8 to 7. Lower temperatures upto 30 deg C was tried, the growth of bacteria was not seen in the medium. Higher temperature yielded a turbid medium within 6 hours indicating full growth however resulted a very low yield. Thus 37 deg C was the optimal temperature which resulted in the best yield. The synthetic fusion gene comprises of hexl and poxl gene by synthetic arrangement of nucleotides, wherein hexl and poxl helps in hydrolysis of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. The synthetic fusion gene helps in complete hydrolysis of lignocellulose into glucose without the use of any pre-treatment method for biodiesel production from paddy. In another embodiment, the synthetic fusion gene can also be used as a pure biological pre- treatment tool for any production of micro diesel. The Synthetic gene is also used in p Cola duet 1 Z. In another embodiment Genes hexl and poxl play the role of degradation of lignocellulose. In an embodiment, the invention may be used on Biomass to produce biofuel. The biomass includes Laila paddy, husk and straw. Oriza sativa having same chemical component or any lignocellulose biomass having same component with different ratio can also be used as biomass. In an embodiment, Fad E. del E. coli is used as host organism. Gene is optimized for E.coli. For other host organism like mammalian, insect and yeast expression a KOZAK sequence is recommended to the upstream of the construct. In another embodiment, other gene that are combined with poxl hexl are pdc, adh, and aft A. pdc & adh help in production of ethanol and aft A helps in the conversion of ethanol into biodiesel). Thus these gene (pdc, adh, aft A) complement fusion gene in producing biodiesel not in any hydrolytic process of lignocellulose. Construction of Synthetic fusion gene: Tricoderma reesi (hexl) is a fungi which is mainly used for hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicelluloses in pre-treatment and Pleurotous sojar caju (poxl) is a mushroom which is used to breakdown lignin in lignocelluloses. These two particular genes hexl and poxl play the role of degradation in these fungi. In the present invention, hexl and poxl were joined together by arranging their cDNA nucleotides, to construct new synthetic fusion gene. Here end codon of Tricoderma reesi (hexl) was spilced and Pleurotous sojar caju (poxl) start codon was attached to it by synthetic arrangement of nucleotides. The stop codon of Pleurotous sojar caju (poxl) acts as end codons for both the genes. Thus, the fusion gene works as single gene having both properties.
