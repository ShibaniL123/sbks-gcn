SMALL MOLECULE HSP70 INHIBITORS [0001] This invention was made with government support under grants R01 CA1 18761 and POICAI 14046 awarded by the US Public Health Service and National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention. [0002] Applicant hereby incorporates by reference the Sequence Listing material filed in electronic form herewith. This filed is labeled "UPN-14-7001PCT_sequence_ST25.txt". BACKGROUND [0003] Maintaining effective protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is critical to the survival of all cells, and it protects against disease. Misfolded or unstructured proteins are functionally impaired; they have the potential to cause formation of potentially toxic aggregates. Critical components in cellular proteostasis networks are the mammalian stress-inducible heat shock protein-70 (HSP70, also called HSPA1A, HSP72) and its evolutionarily conserved bacterial ortholog, DnaK. These proteins coordinate key processes needed to maintain protein quality control, especially under conditions of enhanced stress; their activities include protein folding, protein transport across membranes, formation/dissolution of protein-protein interactions, and preventing accumulation of toxic protein aggregates. Thus, these molecular chaperones protect against the deleterious consequences of elevated physiologic and environmental stresses that cause conformational changes in polypeptides and disrupt protein function. [0004] Altered protein quality control is characteristic of many human diseases. Cancer cells, for example, are subject to an enhanced stress environment that promotes protein misfolding; thus, these aberrant cells are especially dependent on the activities of HSP70 to maintain proteostasis. Indeed, HSP70 is considered a cancer-critical survival protein, and it is constitutively expressed at elevated levels in most cancers. This contrasts with its typically modest expression in unstressed normal cells; this has led to the testable suggestion that HSP70 inhibitors should exhibit a therapeutic index that can be exploited for preferential killing of cancer cells. Elevated HSP70 expression confers protection against a variety of stresses, such as hypoxia, altered metabolism and exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. It also inhibits apoptosis and oncogene-induced senescence, and is a major contributor to poor therapeutic outcome in patients. Reducing HSP70 abundance in cancer cells using RNA interference, antisense approaches, or peptides promotes apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and increases sensitization to chemotherapeutic agents. In mammalian cells, the actions of HSP70 also coordinate with autophagy and proteasome pathways to aid in the disposal and recycling of altered proteins and organelles, and to prevent the accumulation of misfolded, or otherwise unwanted, proteins. Enhanced levels of autophagy are induced by different forms of stress, and promote the survival of established cancers. An impairment of HSP70 would be predicted to disrupt critical pathways of autophagy and the proteasome, particularly in tumor cells. HSP70 is a multifunctional HSP70 protein and a critical co-chaperone for the molecular chaperone HSP90. Working together, these chaperones direct the stability, localization and activity of a large and varied group of client proteins, many of which have been implicated in promoting tumorigenesis. A number of these client proteins have been implicated in the development and/or progression of cellular transformation; they include proteins involved in signal transduction, cell proliferation, or energy production. Examples of these proteins include AKT, BRAF(V600E) and EGFR, among others. [0005] While HSP90 inhibitors are known, one of the consequences of HSP90 inhibition is a robust upregulation of HSP70, likely reducing the overall anti-tumor efficacy of HSP90 inhibitors. Because HSP70 is an obligate co-chaperone for HSP90, but also has independent pro- survival functions in tumor cells, targeting HSP70 has the potential to simultaneously impair multiple signaling- and protein quality control-networks. This strategy offers unique advantages for developing an effective and durable therapy for cancer treatment, even in genetically heterogeneous tumor cells. [0006] Protein misfolding and aggregation contribute to cellular toxicity in disorders such as cystic fibrosis and certain neurodegenerative diseases, and increases in HSP70 expression can modulate this phenotype. Thus, HSP70 and DnaK have emerged as attractive targets for the development of new treatments for cancers and other human disorders, as well as to address the growing need for alternative antimicrobial agents. However, despite a great deal of interest in the translational potential of these chaperones, remarkably few selective, effective modulators have been identified. [0007] HSP70 and DnaK are part of an evolutionarily conserved family of 70 kDa heat shock proteins that have a similar overall structure: they consist of an approximately 44 kDa N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD), a conserved flexible middle linker, and the approximately 25 kDa C-terminal substrate/peptide binding domain (SBD). Each major domain is composed of several highly dynamic subdomains. HSP70 and DnaK exhibit about 45-50% amino acid similarity. These molecular chaperones transiently and dynamically interact with a very large and diverse array of substrates, or clients, by binding exposed hydrophobic regions of partially folded or unfolded proteins. When ADP is bound to the NBD, the substrate binds with high affinity; ATP binding favors substrate release. Allosteric coupling involves cycles of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, together with the binding and release of substrate. [0008] Many previous chemical screens for HSP70 inhibitors have tended to focus on the N- terminal ATP -binding site (or surrounding regions), partly because this approach was successful in identifying inhibitors of the HSP90 molecular chaperone as well as many protein kinases. However, the ATP-binding site of HSP70 has been less amenable to this strategy. While there is great interest in targeting HSP70 and DnaK for therapeutic use, there are very few selective or well-characterized compounds that directly interact with these proteins to modulate function. Further, there are no drugs in clinical trials that directly bind HSP70. 2-Phenylethynesulfonamide (referred to as PES, Fig. 1A), a biotinylated PES analog (referred to as B-PES, Fig. IB) and a chlorinated derivative, 2-(3-chlorophenyl) ethynesulfonamide (PES-C1, Fig. 1C) were previously identified as selective inhibitors of HSP70/DnaK.

[0025] Figures 3 A-3L illustrate that PET- 16 binds directly to ADP-bound HSP70 and DnaK. Specifically, Figs. 3A-3H are isothermal calorimetric titration (ITC) assays of the indicated compounds (NRLLLTG - SEQ ID NO: 7, PES or PET- 16) with purified HSP70-ADP, DnaK- ADP or HSP70-ATP proteins.

Binding constants (Kd values) are shown (average and s.d. from three independent experiments). PET- 16 also binds directly to the purified, full-length, nucleotide-free HSP70 protein, with a reported dissociation constant of 5.2+/- 0.1 micromolar, which is the average and standard deviation from two independent experiments (data not shown). Fig. 3K is ITC assay of HSP70 protein preincubated with ADP and PES for 1 h. The mixture was titrated into the sample cell containing PET- 16. The data are representative of three independent ITC experiments. Fig. 3L are western blots of human lung carcinoma (HI 299) cells that were pretreated with DMSO or excess (8x) PET- 16 for 1 h prior to the addition of 20 μΜ B-PES for 5 h and examined for the expression of HSP70 or BCL-xL. B-PES-containing complexes were captured by Avidin resins and immunoblotted either with anti-HSP70 or anti-BCL-xL antibody. PET- 16 inhibited subsequent interaction of HSP70 with B-PES. [0026] Figures 4A-4L illustrate that PET- 16 impairs proteostasis. Fig. 4A is an EM analysis which shows altered autophagy in PET- 16 treated tumor cells, with formation of autophagosomes, accumulation of vacuoles, and the appearance of granular and aggregated masses. There is a general absence of obvious nuclei in PET- 16 treated tumor cells.

Fig. 4L is a western blot of the human melanoma 451 Lu cells treated with DMSO, PES or PET- 16 for 24 h. Cells were harvested in 1% NP40-containing lysis buffer, fractionated into detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble preparations, and assayed by western blot for ubiquitin. [0027] Figures 5A-5F illustrates that PET- 16 leads to loss of mitochondrial protein Cyclophilin D and impairs bioenergetics in tumor cells. Figs. 5A-5D are western blots of HSP70, which is present at mitochondria of tumor H 1299 cells but not in normal tissue, such as liver. The constitutively expressed 70 kDa family members, HSC70 and GRP75, are present in mitochondria of normal cells. Equal amounts of whole cell (WC)-, cytosolic (cyto)-, and mitochondrial (mito)-extracts prepared from cell lines HI 299 (A, C) and MIA PaCa-2 (B) or normal (liver) cells (C, D) were examined by western blot analysis for the presence of the proteins indicated. Generally, only the lower molecular weight, leaderless form of BAK is found in the mitochondria of tumor and normal cells; a higher molecular weight, unprocessed form of BAK, is the form present in cytosolic and whole cell extracts prepared from the mouse liver. Fig 5E is a western blot of purified mitochondria from human lung carcinoma H I 299 cells treated with DMSO, PES or PET- 16. Mitochondrial (mito)-extracts prepared and examined by western blot analysis for the presence of the indicated proteins. PET- 16 significantly reduced the abundance of Cyp-D in the soluble-protein fraction, consistent with functional inactivation. Fig. 5F is a line graph of total cellular ATP levels using the AlamarBlue® assay, an indicator of mitochondrial metabolic activity, particularly of the mitochondrial electron chain. Decreases of AlamarBlue® fluorescence, indicative of mitochondrial damage, are noted in PET- 16-treated tumor cells (melanoma tumor cell line WM88 (— ), melanoma tumor cell line WM3000 (x), melanoma tumor cell line WM852 (*), human melanoma 451 Lu cells (·), and melanoma tumor cell line WM989 ( | ), but not normal cells (nontransformed human fibroblasts (IMR90 -♦) and primary melanocytes (■)). Values are normalized to the vehicle-treated cells. Error bars represent standard deviation (s.d.) of four independent experiments. [0028] Figure 6 is a line graph illustrating that PET- 16 synergizes with the BRAF inhibitor Vemurafenib to reduce the viability of the melanoma tumor cell line WM989 (■). WM989 cells treated singularly with Vemurafenib are depicted by (·). No synergy was detected between Vemurafenib and PES-C1. [0029] Figures 7A-7C illustrate that PET- 16 impairs metastasis in a mouse model of melanoma. A well-recognized pulmonary metastatic model was utilized in which immunocompetent, wild- type C57BL/6 mice were injected with the highly metastatic mouse melanoma cell line B16, as indicated. The results of the experiment provide evidence that PET- 16 is able to significantly impair the appearance of lung metastases. Fig. 7A is a summary of the steps entailed in the model. Fig. 7B are photographs of biopsied lungs obtained from the infected mice. Fig. 7C provides a graphical representation of counts of metastatic colonies intermediate gray square represents 0 colonies, lightest gray square represents 1-10 colonies and darkest gray square represents > 10 colonies) seen in lungs of vehicle-, PES-C1- or PET- 16-treated mice. [0030] Figures 8A-8D provide the X-ray crystal structure of the HIS6-IEGR-DnaK-PET-16 (referred to here as DnaK-PET- 16) complex. Fig. 8A is the overall structure of the DnaK-PET- 16 complex. The major domains and secondary structural elements are labeled, e.g., PET- 16, in MolB. This figure can also be seen as Figure 3A in Leu, JI et al, 2014 ACS Chem. Biol. 9:2508- 2516, incorporated by reference herein. Fig. 8B is an electron density map corresponding to PET- 16 of the DnaK-PET-16 cocrystal structure. The map is contoured at 3.0 σ from a simulated annealing F0-Fc omit map of the refined structure without any contribution from the PET- 16 inhibitor model.

Note also that this additional electron density in MolB of the DnaK-PET- 16 complex was modeled as PET- 16, with the electron-rich phosphine in the region of greatest electron density and the phenyl group and acetylene linker pointing into the hydrophobic pocket and the TPP pointing out towards solvent, which was consistent with additional rounds of crystallographic refinement. This figure can also be seen as Figure 3B in Leu, JI et al, 2014 cited above. Fig. 8C provides the hydrophobic pocket for PET- 16 in the DnaK-PET-16 structure.

[0031] Figures 9A-9H illustrate that PET- 16 binds directly to ADP-bound HSP70 and is cytotoxic to human tumor cells. Figs. 9A-9C are ITC assays of the interaction of PET-3C with purified human HSP70-ADP (A), human HSP70-ATP (B) and DnaK-ADP (C) proteins. The data are representative of three independent experiments. Fig. 9D is a line graph of an MTT assay of the human melanoma cell line 1205 Lu treated with the indicated concentrations of PET- 16 (— ) or PET-3C (— ) for 72 h. The corresponding cell survival is normalized to the DMSO-treatment. Average and standard deviation (s.d.) from three independent experiments are shown. Fig. 9E is a line graph illustrating the growth of E. coli DH5a strain treated with different concentrations of PET- 16 (black) or PET-3C (gray) for 6 h at 43°C. Error bars represent the s.d. of four independent experiments. Fig. 9F is a bar graph illustrating the growth of E. coli DH5a treated with DMSO, 30 μΜ PET- 16, 30 μΜ PET-3C or 30 μΜ TPP for 6 h at 43°C. Error bars represent the s.d. of four independent experiments. Figs. 9G and 9H are ITC measurement of the interaction of PET-DR with purified human HSP70-ADP (G) and human HSP70-ATP (H) proteins. The data are representative of three independent experiments. [0032] Figure 10 is a graph demonstrating the cytoxicity of PET- 16 for human melanoma tumor cell lines. MTT assays of human melanoma cell lines, as indicated, treated with the indicated concentration of PET- 16 for 72 hours. The corresponding cell survival is normalized to vehicle (DMSO) treatment. Average and standard deviation (s.d.) from three independent experiments are shown. This compound exhibits similar cytotoxic potential against a diverse group of human melanoma cell lines, independent of their genotype. [0033] Figures 1 1A through 1 ID are Western blots that illustrate that in cells treated with PET- 16, HSP70/HSP90 client proteins exhibit altered expression. PET- 16 promotes the loss of HSP90/HSP70 client proteins from the soluble fraction and the accumulation of some of these client proteins in the protein detergent-insoluble cellular fraction. Human melanoma cell lines (451 Lu, 1205 Lu and WM852) and mouse melanoma cell line (Yumm), as indicated, were treated with DMSO, PES or PET- 16 for 24 hours. Cells were fractionated into detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble preparations and assayed by Western blot (WB) analysis for the proteins indicated. Note that the HSP70 cochaperones (HSP40 and CHIP), the ubiquitin-binding triage protein (p62/SQSTMl), cell-cycle checkpoint modulators (Cyclin Bl and BubRl), ubiquitin, oncogenic factors critically involved in processes such as tumor growth and metastasis (STAT1, STAT3 and FAK), apoptosis markers (Caspase-3 and Cleaved Lamin A), and melanoma malignancy marker (BRAF/V600E) exhibit altered expression patterns after PET- 16 treatment. The expression of many of these proteins is reduced in the soluble cell fractions, and often the abundance increases in the detergent insoluble fractions. This is indicative of loss of function of the client proteins. [0034] Figures 12A and 12B illustrate that PET- 16 treatment leads to the accumulation of proteins that are now modifed with ubiquitin, a molecular tag suggesting that the proteins are being targeted for degradation, as expected if the proteins are no longer properly folded because HSP70 function is impaired. PET- 16 promotes the accumulation of ubiquitinated polypeptides in an HSP70-dependent manner. (Figs. 12A and 12B) Mouse Yumm melanoma tumor cell line, stably transfected with vector or hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human full-length HSP70 construct (12A) and human HI 299 lung carcinoma cells, transfected with a negative shR A (sh-Negative) or with HSP70 shR As (sh-HSP70) (12B), were treated with DMSO or PET- 16, as indicated. Proteins were assayed by WB for ubiquitin in the detergent insoluble fraction (Figs. 12A and B) and for HSP70 and HSC70 in the detergent-soluble fraction (12B). Note PET-16 treated cells exhibit an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, and this is reduced when HSP70 is reduced. [0035] Figures 13A through 13F illustrate that PET- 16 binds directly to HSP70 and promotes its self-association. (Fig. 13 A) Cyto- and mito-extracts from tumor cells treated as indicated were analyzed for molecular chaperones HSP70, HSP90 and HSP40. (Fig. 13B) The indicated subcellular fractions were crosslinked with BMH. HSP70 oligomers were detected by immunoblotting with anti-HSP70 antibody. (Fig. 13C) PES directly promotes tetramerization of DnaK-SBD (aa 389-607), as demonstrated by the crystal structure (PDB code 4R5L). (Figs. 13D and E) ITC binding isotherms recorded for full-length recombinant human HSP70 protein pretreated either with ADP (Fig.13D) or ATP (Fig. 13E) and titrated into a solution of PET-16. The data shown here are representative of two independent experiments. Note, PET-16 binds directly to ADP-bound HSP70, but not ATP-bound HSP70. Also, the ITC binding curve (Figure 13D) supports a stoichiometry (N=0.25) whereby one molecule of PET-16 binds in a complex containing four molecules of ADP-bound HSP70. This contrasts with Figure 3C, whereby one molecule of PET- 16 binds to two molecules of ADP-bound HSP70. This study demonstrates that PET- 16 binds directly to ADP-bound HSP70 resulting in its self-oligomerization, and that PET- 16 exhibits greater affinity toward tetrameric ADP-bound HSP70 (N=0.25, Kd = 1.3+/- 0.15 micromolar), than dimeric ADP-bound HSP70 (N=0.5, Kd = 3.8+/- 1.0 micromolar). (Fig. 13F) PET- 16 directly promotes dimerization and tetramerization of DnaK-SBD (aa 389-607), as demonstrated by the dimeric crystal structure (PDB code 4R5G) and the tetrameric crystal structure (PDB code 4R5J). [0036] Figures 14A and 14B provide evidence that PET- 16 impairs melanoma growth in vivo as a single agent. A well-recognized pulmonary metastatic model was utilized in which immunocompetent, wild-type C57BL/6 mice were injected with the metastatic mouse melanoma cell line Yumm 1.7, as indicated. The results of the experiment provide evidence that PET- 16 is able to significantly impair the appearance of lung metastases as a single agent. Fig. 14A is a summary of the steps entailed in the model. Fig. 14B shows that PET- 16 inhibits melanoma xenograft growth. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0037] Described herein is a novel class of selective small molecule modulators of the mammalian stress-inducible molecular chaperone HSP70 and of its bacterial homologue, DnaK. These proteins function as critical regulators of cellular proteostasis, especially during conditions of enhanced stress. Importantly, the inhibitors described herein are unusual in that they bind to the C-terminal domains of HSP70/DnaK within HSP70 residues 386-616 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (comparable DnaK residues 389-607 of SEQ ID NO: 4); the inhibitor binding site is distinct from the substrate binding pocket. The present invention, therefore, provides the first identification and characterization of this critical allosteric site. [0038] As used herein, modulation of HSP70 refers to modulating one or more of nascent protein folding, refolding of misfolded proteins, reducing/preventing denatured/misfolded protein aggregation, modulating assembly/disassembly of protein complexes, targeting proteins for proper intracellular location, targeting altered proteins for degradation by proteasomes, lysosomes or in pathways of autophagy, modulating cell death pathways, chaperone protein binding, client protein binding, modulation of cellular stress response, and modulation of caspase cleavage pathways. [0039] Advantageously, the small molecule compounds discussed herein have a strong dependence on tumor cells, but not normal cells, thereby resulting in the preferential killing of tumor cells relative to normal cells. [0040] Of importance, an allosteric pocket located outside the canonical substrate binding cleft in the C-terminus of DnaK and HSP70 was discovered and is a site of interaction with a compound discussed herein. Previous to the identification of the compounds discussed herein, no natural or synthetic small molecule compounds are known to bind to this previously uncharacterized pocket. As a result of this unprecedented discovery, the inventors were able to identify HSP70 inhibitors, construct novel HSP70 inhibitors, modify the structures of known compounds to bind to this allosteric site, and screen databases or libraries for effective HSP70 inhibitors. [0041] The compounds discussed herein disrupt the HSP70 molecular chaperone machinery, leading to altered substrate fate and an accumulation of misfolded, mislocated, and non- functional proteins. When occupied by a compound described herein, the allosteric pocket in HSP70 and DnaK inhibit chaperone activities resulting in (i) inhibition of malignant cell growth, (ii) inhibition of cytotoxicity of malignant cells (iii) reduced cell cycle progression (iv) altered expression of several proteins contributing to a transformed phenotype and (v) reduction in invasive potential of cancer cells at doses not toxic to normal cells. By doing so, the compounds discussed herein dysregulate cell cycle control, alter autophagy-lysosome systems or impair ubiquitin-proteasome pathways to reduce the ability of tumor cells to maintain protein quality control. Advantageously, the methods for occupying this allosteric pocket with the compounds described herein result in dual inhibition of HSP70 and HSP90 oncogenic pathways and functional depletion of onco-proteins driving malignant processes and cell signaling events. Accordingly, the compounds described herein may be used to induce mitochondrial cell death in transformed cells, e.g., cancer cells, while having minimal or no effect on normal mitochondria. Such methods of using the compounds and methods of designing similarly functional compounds are provided. [0042] A.

[0101] Any of the chemical groups or moieties described above may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more groups provided that the resultant compound is chemically stable. In one embodiment, the chemical groups or moieties may be substituted with one or more halogen, OH, NH2, N(Ci to C3 alkyl)C(0)(Ci to C6 alkyl), NHC(0)(Ci to C6 alkyl), NHC(0)H, C(0)NH2, C(0)NH(Ci to C6 alkyl), C(0)N(Ci to C6 alk l)(Ci to C6 alkyl), CN, Ci to C6 alkoxy, C(0)OH, C(0)0(Ci to C6 alkyl), C(0)(Ci to C6 alkyl), aryl, heteroaryl, heterocycle, NH(Ci to C6 alkyl), N(Ci to C6 alkyl)(Ci to C6 alkyl), OC(0)(Ci to C6 alkyl), or N02. [0102] Methods useful for making compounds embodied by formula (I) are set forth in the Examples below. One of skill in the art will recognize that the description in the Examples can be adapted to produce the other compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof. [0103] C. Crystal Structures [0104] As discussed above, a new chemical scaffold was identified in molecules that interact with the C-terminal region of HSP70 and DnaK and inhibit chaperone function. To better understand the mode of action of these compounds, the X-ray crystal structure of the C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD) of Escherichia coli DnaK in complex with a compound discussed herein, i.e., PET- 16, was identified and molecular modeling of the same was performed. See, also, the additional description of X-ray crystal structure studies detailed in Leu 2014, cited above, and incorporated herein by reference. [0105] As used herein, the term "modeling" includes the analysis of molecular structure based on atomic structural information and interaction models. The term "modeling" also includes conventional numeric-based molecular dynamic and energy minimization models, interactive computer graphic models, modified molecular mechanics models, distance geometry and other structure -based constraint models. Such modeling methods are to design or select chemical entities that possess stereochemical complementary to the HIS6-IEGR-DnaK-PET-16 (referred to here as DnaK-PET- 16) complex. By "stereochemical complementarity" is meant that the compound or a portion thereof makes a sufficient number of energetically favorable contacts with the residues of the hydrophobic region. [0106] In one embodiment, molecular modeling includes in silico design which includes directly docking molecules from a three-dimensional structural database, to the hydrophobic site. This method uses geometric criteria to assess the goodness-of-fit of a particular molecule to the site. By doing so, the number of internal degrees of freedom (and the corresponding local minima in the molecular conformation space) is reduced by considering only the geometric (hard-sphere) interactions of two rigid bodies, where one body (the active site) contains "pockets" or "grooves" that form binding sites for the second body (the complementing molecule). HSP70 inhibitors identified on the basis of geometric parameters can then be modified to satisfy criteria associated with chemical complementarity, such as hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions and Van der Waals interactions. Different scoring functions can be employed to rank and select the best molecule from a database or library. [0107] The crystal structure revealed that PET- 16 inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues located in the interdomain and SBDP subdomain of both DnaK and HSP70 proteins. This region is distinct from the substrate binding site. This pocket is present in the ADP-bound protein conformation, and is distinct from the site where the substrate binds. This is a previously unknown allosteric site in the C-terminus of the protein. [0108] The term "hydrophobic pocket" or "binding pocket" refers to a region within HSP70, DnaK, the C-terminal SBD of E. coli or the C-terminal SBD of mammalian stress-inducible HSP70 that associates with a compound described herein. The term "pocket" includes, without limitation, a cleft, channel, groove, cavity or site. Similarly, the phrase "portion of the hydrophobic pocket", or variations thereof, refers to less than all of the amino acid residues that define the hydrophobic pocket. The structure coordinates of amino acid residues that form part of the hydrophobic pocket may be specific for defining the chemical environment of the hydrophobic pocket. For example, the portion of amino acid residues may be key residues that play a role in the binding of the compounds discussed herein or may be residues that are spatially related and define a three-dimensional compartment of the hydrophobic pocket. The amino acid residues may be contiguous or noncontiguous in primary sequence. In one embodiment, part of the binding pocket has at least two amino acid residues, preferably at least three, six, eight, ten, fourteen or fifteen amino acid residues. [0109] As used herein, the term "atomic coordinates" refers to mathematical coordinates that describe the positions of atoms in crystals formed between E. coli DnaK and/or mammalian HSP70 with a compound described herein including X, Y, Z and B for each atom. The diffraction data obtained from the crystals may be used to calculate an electron density map of the repeating unit of the crystal. The electron density maps may be used to establish the positions, i.e., coordinates X, Y and Z, of the individual atoms within the crystal. Atomic coordinates may be loaded onto a machine readable-medium for computational manipulation. In one embodiment, the machine readable media includes, without limitation, non-transient magnetic or optical media and random-access or read-only memory, including tapes, diskettes, hard disks, CD-ROMs and DVDs, flash memory cards or chips, servers and the internet. In another embodiment, the machine is a computer. The atomic coordinates may be used in a computer to generate a representation, e.g., an image, of the three-dimensional structure of the complex formed between a chemical compound discussed herein and DnaK and/or HSP70. The representation may be displayed by the computer and/or represented in an electronic file. The atomic coordinates and models derived therefrom may also be used for selection and X-ray crystallographic analysis of chemical compounds. [0110] Accordingly, a computer for producing a three-dimensional representation of a DnaK- HSP70 inhibitor complex is provided. One of skill in the art would readily be able to select a suitable computer for use herein. In one embodiment, the computer contains a computer-readable data storage medium containing a data storage material encoded with computer-readable data, a working memory for storing instructions for processing the computer-readable data, a central- processing unit coupled to the working memory and to the computer-readable data storage medium for processing the computer-machine readable data into the three-dimensional representation; and a display coupled to the central-processing unit for displaying the three- dimensional representation. The data manipulated therein includes the structure coordinates of a HIS6-IEGR-DnaK-PET- 16 (referred to here as DnaK-PET- 16) crystal and the structure coordinates of a crystal of the DnaK-HSP70 inhibitor. [0111] Similarly, the machine-readable data storage medium may also be selected by one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the machine -readable data storage medium contains a data storage material encoded with machine readable data. In another embodiment, the data is defined by at least a portion of the structure coordinates of HIS6-IEGR-DnaK-PET- 16 (referred to here as DnaK-PET- 16) in Table 1. [0112] The screening/design methods may be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination of both. In one embodiment, the programs and screening methods are implemented using computer programs executed on programmable computers each containing a processor, a data storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device. Program code is applied to input data to perform the hereinabove described functions and generate output information. The output information is applied to one or more output devices. The computer may be, for example, a personal computer, microcomputer, or workstation of conventional design. Each such computer program may be stored on a storage medium or device, e.g., ROM or magnetic diskette, readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer. [0113] In one embodiment, the HSP70 inhibitor physically and structurally associates with HSP70 or DnaK. In another embodiment, the HSP70 assumes a conformation that allows it to associate with HSP70 or DnaK. Although certain portions of the compound may not directly participate in the binding, those portions may influence the overall conformation of the molecule. Such conformational requirements include the overall three-dimensional structure and orientation of the chemical entity or compound in relation to all or a portion of the hydrophobic site or the spacing between functional groups of the chemical compound. [0114] The crystal structures may be solved using programs and skill in the art. In one embodiment, the crystal structure is solved using molecular replacement optionally in combination with MAD (Multiwavelength Anomalous Dispersion) and/or MIRAS (Multiple Isomorphous Replacement with Anomalous Scattering), among others. [0115] The structures may be then refined using computer software known in the art. In one embodiment, the computer software includes, without limitation, X-PLOR (Meth. Enzymol., vol. 1 14 & 1 15, Wyckoff et al., eds., Academic Press (1985)), MLPHARE (Collaborative computational project Number 4. The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography (1994) Acta Crystallogr. D 50, 760-763) and SHARP (De La Fortelle, 1997, Methods Enzymol. 276: 472-494). The overall figure of merit may be improved by iterative solvent flattening, phase combination and phase extension with the program SOLOMON (Abrahams, 1996, ATPase, Acta Crystallogr. D 52: 1 10-1 19), among others. [0116] A person skilled in the art may use one of several methods to screen test compounds for their ability to associate with DnaK or human HSP70 and more particularly with the hydrophobic pocket contained herein. This process may begin by visual inspection of, for example, the active site on the computer screen based on the three dimensional atomic coordinates of HIS6-IEGR- DnaK-PET- 16 (referred to here as DnaK- PET- 16) complex. Selected chemical entities or test compounds may then be positioned in a variety of orientations. Docking may be accomplished using software such as Quanta and Sybyl. Such programs permit comparisons between different structures, different conformations of the same structure, and different parts of the same structure, followed by energy minimization and molecular dynamics with standard molecular mechanics force fields such as CHARMM and AMBER, among others. [0117] Specialized computer programs may be utilized to select or screen chemical compounds. These include, without limitation, MCSS (Miranker, 1991, Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetics, 1 1 : 29-34); GRID (Goodford, 1985, J. Med. Chem., 28: 849-857) DOCK (Kuntz, 1982, Journal of Molecular Biology, 161 : 269-288), and AUTODOCK (Goodsell, 1990, Proteins: Structure. Function, and Genetics, 8: 195-202, among others. [0118] Once suitable chemical compounds have been selected, they may be assembled into a single compound. Assembly may proceed by visual inspection of the relationship of the chemical compounds in relation to the three-dimensional atomic coordinates of the HIS6-IEGR-DnaK- PET- 16 (referred to here as DnaK-PET- 16) structure. This may be followed by manual model building using software such as Quanta, Sybyl or O (Jones, 1991, Acta Crystallogr. A 47: 1 10- 1 19). Refinement of the model may be carried out using CNS (Brunger, 1998, Acta Crystallogr. D 54: 905-921]. In addition, programs may be used to connect the individual chemical entities or test compounds. In one embodiment, these programs include, without limitation, 3D Database systems (Martin, 1992, J. Med. Chem., 35: 2145-2154) and CAVEAT (Bartlett, 1989, Royal Chem. Soc. 78: 182-196). [0119] Once a chemical compound is identified, the efficiency with which that entity or compound may bind to HSP70 or DnaK may be tested and optimized by computational evaluation. In one embodiment, an efficient HSP70 inhibitor has a dissociation constant (Kd) of about 2 to about 20 μΜ or integers or fractions there between, such as based on ITC studies. [0120] Rather than build an HSP70 inhibitor one chemical entity at a time, other HSP70 inhibitors may be designed as a whole or de novo using either an empty binding site or optionally including some portion(s) of a known inhibitor(s). Such compounds may be designed using programs. In one embodiment, the program is a de novo program. In another embodiment, the program is LEGEND (Nishibata, 1991, Tetrahedron, 47:8985) and LUDI (Bohm, 1992, J. Comp. Aid. Molec. Design, 6:61-78). [0121] The selected/designed compounds may then be tested for their binding efficiency to DnaK or HSP70 via computational evaluations using computer software. Such software may include, without limitation, QUANT A/CHARMM, Insight II/Discover, and/or MODELER. These types of programs may be implemented, e.g., using a workstation. [0122] After selection/design of the HSP70 inhibitor, substitutions may be made among the L, M, and R -R5 groups for improving or modifying binding properties. These substituted chemical compounds may then be analyzed for efficiency of binding to HSP70 by the same computer methods described above. [0123] The crystals may be obtained using methods known to those skilled in the art of forming crystals. In one embodiment, the crystals are formed using methods of protein crystallization screens, e.g., automated protein crystallization screen maker system, high-throughput robotic protein crystallization system, or automated protein crystallization workstation, among others. In another embodiment, crystals are formed using vapor diffusion, e.g. , hanging drop or sitting drop, microbatch, microdialysis, free-interface diffusion, or seeding, among others. Organic and inorganic solvents and protein crystallization additives are utilized optionally in the presence of a seed crystal or HSP70/DnaK-inhibitor protein mixture. In a further embodiment, the crystal is formed at temperatures below, at, or above room temperature. In still another embodiment, the crystals are formed using solutions containing one or both of ammonium sulfate or Bis-Tris. In yet a further embodiment, the crystal may be prepared using hanging-drop crystallization techniques at room temperature using about 1 μΐ. protein and 1 μΐ^ of a solution containing about 1.8 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M Bis-Tris at a pH of 5.5. [0124] Using such methods as described above and in the examples below, a co-crystal between HIS6-IEGR-DnaK and PET- 16 (referred to here as the DnaK-PET- 16 structure) was generated and the three-dimensional crystal structure obtained. The co-crystal is a tetragonal crystal in space group P432i2 with a unit cell dimension of a=91.78, b=91.78 and c=136.89 (see Figs. 8A- 8C). As discussed above, a hydrophobic pocket was identified in this structure. This hydrophobic pocket contains several key points of contact between PET- 16 and DnaK. In one embodiment, the hydrophobic pocket contains strand βΐ of DnaK. In another embodiment, the strand βΐ in the hydrophobic pocket contains amino acid residue L399 of SEQ ID NO: 4. In a further embodiment, the hydrophobic pocket contains loop LL, 1 of DnaK. In still another embodiment, loop LL, 1 of the hydrophobic pocket contains one or both of amino acid residue L392 or P396 of SEQ ID NO: 4. In yet another embodiment, the hydrophobic pocket contains loop L6,7 of DnaK. In a further embodiment, loop 6,7 of the hydrophobic pocket contains amino acid residue G482 of SEQ ID NO: 4. In yet a further embodiment, the hydrophobic pocket contains loop ί ,β. In another embodiment, loop ί ,β of the hydrophobic pocket contains one or both of amino acid residue A503 and S504 of SEQ ID NO: 4. [0125] This hydrophobic pocket in the C-terminal SBD of DnaK corresponds to a hydrophobic pocket contained in HSP70. In one embodiment, the hydrophobic pocket in HSP70 contains strand βΐ . In another embodiment, the strand βΐ in the hydrophobic pocket in HSP70 contains amino acid residue L401 of SEQ ID NO: 2. In a further embodiment, the hydrophobic pocket in HSP70 contains strand β7. In still another embodiment, strand β7 of the hydrophobic pocket in HSP70 contains amino acid residue G484 of SEQ ID NO: 2. In yet a further embodiment, the hydrophobic pocket in HSP70 contains loop LL, 1. In still another embodiment, loop LL, 1 of the hydrophobic pocket in HSP70 contains one or both of amino acid residue L394 or P398 of SEQ ID NO: 2. In yet a further embodiment, the hydrophobic pocket in HSP70 contains loop ί ,β. In another embodiment, loop ί ,β of the hydrophobic pocket in HSP70 contains one or both of amino acid residue N505 or D506 of SEQ ID NO: 2. In addition, see Figs. 3A to 3F, Figs. 4, 5 and S1-S5 of Leu et al, 2014, cited above, and incorporated by reference herein. [0126] The chemical compounds described herein and those identified using the crystal and the methods described herein may be screened in assays. For example, the screening may be in vitro, in cell culture, and/or in vivo.

Optionally, the assays are automated for high capacity-high throughput screening. Other assays include, without limitation, western blots, size exclusion chromatography, BIAcore biosensors, X-Ray absorption spectrometry, mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), fluorescence polarization, fluorescence anisotropy, circular dichroism, tryptophan fluorescence, isothermal titration calorimetry, pull-down assays and animal studies, among others. [0127] D.

[0160] One of skill in the art would be able to determine the amount of these pharmaceutical agents to administer in combination with a compound of formula (I). In one embodiment, lower doses of the compounds of formula (I) are required when administered in combination with an additional pharmacologically active reagent. In a further embodiment, the combination of the compound of formula (I) with another pharmacological agent or treatment protocol permits lower than usual dosages of the additional pharmacological agent to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. In another embodiment, the combination of the compound of formula (I) with another pharmacological agent or treatment protocol permits adjustment of the additional protocol regimen to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. In yet a further embodiment, the combination of the compound of formula (I) with another pharmacological agent or treatment protocol permits lower doses of the compounds to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. [0161] E. Treatment Methods [0162] In recognizing the need in the art for therapies for treating diseases mediated by HSP70, the inventors identified the small molecules discussed herein. The compounds of formula (I) unexpectedly bind to the C-terminal domain of HSP70 or the C-terminal domain of DnaK. In one embodiment, these compounds are useful in the treatment of neoplastic disease. The terms "neoplastic disease" and "cancer" are used interchangeably herein and refer to a disease or condition in which a patient has an abnormal mass of tissue due to an abnormal proliferation of cells. The abnormal proliferation of cells may result in a localized lump, be present in the lymphatic system, or may be systemic. In one embodiment, the neoplastic disease is benign. In another embodiment, the neoplastic disease is pre -malignant, i.e., potentially malignant neoplastic disease. In a further embodiment, the neoplastic disease is malignant, i.e., cancer. In one embodiment, the neoplastic disease includes, without limitation, epithelial cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, liver cancer, cervical cancer, anal cancer, penile cancer, vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, skin cancer, melanoma, oral cancer, colon cancer, neck cancer, head cancer, eye cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, leukemia, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, mesothelioma, bone cancer, brain cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, or lymphoma. In another embodiment, the neoplastic disease includes ovarian cancer, skin cancer, melanoma, oral cancer, or colon cancer. Still other HSP70-related neoplastic diseases are anticipated to respond to the methods and compositions described herein. [0163] Advantageously, the compounds of formula (I) are selective to HSP70 containing cells and have low toxicity to non-transformed cells. The term "low toxicity" as used herein refers to an IC5o of about 100 μΜ or integers or fractions less than 100 μΜ. These characteristics ensure that these compounds do not affect the healthy cells of the patient and permit more effective treatment. Further, the patient experiences considerably fewer side effects due to this selective cancer targeting regimen. This finding is integral in the treatment of certain cancers which are linked to HSP70 and for which there are no known small molecule drug therapies. [0164] The inventors found that the compounds of formula (I) are highly selective in killing HSP70 containing cells alone or in combination with an additional pharmaceutical agent discussed above. In one embodiment, the compounds of formula (I) additively or synergistically function with the additional pharmaceutical agents in the methods described herein. [0165] Accordingly, methods of inhibiting HSP70 or DnaK in a mammalian subject in need thereof are provided. Such subjects can be those suffering from a cancer referenced above. The methods are also useful in reducing HSP70 in mitochondria, which is advantageous since mitochondria are key factors in the regulation of cell death pathways of cancer cells. [0166] These methods include administering a compound which co-crystallizes with HSP70 or DnaK to a subject in need thereof. In one embodiment, the compound contacts the hydrophobic pocket in HSP70 and binds to one or more amino acids in strand βΐ, strand β7, loop LL,1, and loop ί ,β of the SBD of human HSP70 as described above. In another embodiment, the compound contacts the hydrophobic pocket in HSP70 and binds to one or more amino acids in strand βΐ, loop LL,1, loop L6,7 and loop La,P of DnaK. In yet a further embodiment, the compound is a compound of formula (I) as described above. [0167] Additional steps in the methods of treatment discussed may be performed. In one embodiment, the method also includes performing a competitive fluorescence polarization assay, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), isothermal titration calorimetry, pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, circular dichroism or tryptophan fluorescence to test for binding of the HSP70 inhibitor to HSP70. In another embodiment, the method also includes computationally evaluating the structural fit of the HSP70 inhibitor in the hydrophobic pocket. In yet a further embodiment, the method further includes testing the HSP70 inhibitor for cell death in cancer cells using a growth inhibition assay that measure a cancer phenotype. [0168] In yet another embodiment, the compounds may be utilized to impair cancer spread, or metastases. Methods of using the compounds for this purpose are described as are methods of designing and screening similarly functional compounds for this use. [0169] The efficacy of the compounds discussed herein may be determined or estimated based on the corresponding IC50 values. In one embodiment, a higher IC50 correlates with a less potent compound. In another embodiment, a lower IC5o correlates with a more potent compound. In a further embodiment, the compounds discussed herein have IC5o values of about 5 μΜ or integers or fractions less than about 5 μΜ. [0170] The effective dosage or amount of the compounds may vary depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration, the type and severity of the condition being treated, and subject being treated as determined by the subject's physician. In one embodiment, the effective amount is about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg. In another embodiment, the effective amount is about 0.5 to about 40 mg/kg. In a further embodiment, the effective amount is about 0.7 to about 30 mg/kg. In still another embodiment, the effective amount is about 1 to about 20 mg/kg. In yet a further embodiment, the effective amount is about 0.001 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg body weight. In another embodiment, the effective amount is less than about 5 g/kg, about 500 mg/kg, about 400 mg/kg, about 300 mg/kg, about 200 mg/kg, about 100 mg/kg, about 50 mg/kg, about 25 mg/kg, about 10 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg, about 0.5 mg/kg, about 0.25 mg/kg, about 0.1 mg/kg, about 100 μg/kg, about 75 μg/kg, about 50 μg/kg, about 25 μg/kg, about 10 μg/kg, or about 1 μg/kg. However, the effective amount of the compound can be determined by the attending physician and depends on the condition treated, the compound administered, the route of delivery, age, weight, severity of the patient's symptoms and response pattern of the patient. [0171] The effective amount of the compound may be provided on regular schedule, i.e., daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis or on an irregular schedule with varying administration days, weeks, months, etc. Alternatively, the effective amount to be administered may vary. In one embodiment, the effective amount for the first dose is higher than the effective amount for one or more of the subsequent doses. In another embodiment, the effective amount for the first dose is lower than the effective amount for one or more of the subsequent doses. The number and frequency of dosages corresponding to a completed course of therapy will be determined according to the judgment of a health-care practitioner. The effective amounts described herein refer to total amounts administered for a given time period; that is, if more than one compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered, the effective amounts correspond to the total amount administered. [0172] These dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses of each component may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally increased or reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. In one embodiment, the compounds or compositions discussed herein may be administered on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis. In one embodiment, daily administration is once. In another embodiment, daily administration includes divided units which are administered over the course of each day. [0173] F. Screening Methods [0174] To enable identification of new chemical entities or compositions that induce the EBV lytic cycle, the inventors developed a method for screening assay. Due to the need for improved efficacious therapeutics with lower toxicity and a decreased potential for recurrence of HSP70 related, this screening method may be performed for the high throughput screening of thousands of compounds. [0175] The discovery of the hydrophobic pocket discussed above permits the screening of chemical compounds to identify potential HSP70 and/or DnaK inhibitors. Such a screening method includes first determining the three-dimensional structure of a complex containing a HSP70 inhibitor and DnaK by X-ray diffraction to produce atomic coordinates. A three dimensional model of this complex is generated utilizing thee atomic coordinates or portions thereof. The three dimensional model is then compared with a three dimensional model for a HIS6-IEGR-DnaK-PET- 16 (referred to here as DnaK- PET- 16) complex as discussed above. In one embodiment, the three dimensional model for the complex is compared with the hydrophobic pocket in the three dimensional model for a DnaK-PET- 16 complex. In another embodiment, the HSP70 inhibitor binds in the hydrophobic pocket in the three-dimensional structure of the complex. [0176] The method optionally includes identifying a test compound as an inhibitor. In one embodiment, the identification is performed by detecting binding of the test compound within the hydrophobic pocket to one or more of amino acid residues L401, G484, N505, D506, L394, and P398 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (HSP70). In another embodiment, identification is performed by detecting binding of the test compound within the pocket to one or more of amino acid residues L399, L392, P396, G482, A503 and S504 of SEQ ID NO: 4 (DnaK). [0177] G. Additional Treatment Protocols [0178] The compounds and methods described herein may also be utilized for inhibiting or reducing bacterial growth in a subject in need thereof.

In one embodiment, the bacterium is E. coli. [0179] The phrase "inhibit bacterial growth" as used herein refers to preventing bacterial growth in or on a subject. Similarly, the phrase "reduce bacterial growth" as used herein refers to reducing or eliminating the bacterial load in or on a subject infected with a bacterium. Accordingly, the method may optionally include the administration of an antimicrobial and/or bacteriostatic agent set forth above. [0180] H.

[0202] K. Examples [0203] (i) Reagents and Antibodies [0204] The primary and secondary antibodies were described in Leu 2009 and Leu 201 1. Sulfo- NHS-SS-Biotin (Biotin) and PES (2-Phenylethynesulfonamide or Pifithrin-μ) were purchased from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc. (Rockford, IL) and EMD Millipore Chemicals, Inc. (Billerica, MA), respectively. The HSP70 antibodies used for the affinity purification studies were from Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (Farmingdale, NY, USA). The other antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA). [0205] (ii) Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, B-PES Pull-Down Assays, Mass Spectrometry and Electron Microscopy [0206] Western blotting, immunoprecipitations and B-PES pull down assays were performed as described in Leu 2009 and Leu 201 1. Preparation of biotin-conjugated PES was described in Leu 2009 and Leu 201 1 ; Balaburski, 2013. Liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry was performed by the Genomics Institute and Abramson Cancer Center Proteomics Core Facility at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania. Electron microscopy (EM) and EM imaging were performed by The Electron Microscopy Resource Laboratory, Biomedical Research Core Facilities, at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania. [0207] (iii) Plasmids and Proteins [0208] The human stress-inducible HSP70 (residues 1-641 or 386-616 of SEQ ID NO: 2) and E. coli DnaK (residues 1-638, 389-607, or 393-507 of SEQ ID NO: 4) were cloned into the pET25 vector (EMD Millipore Chemicals, Inc., Billerica, MA, USA) between the Ndel and Xhol restriction sites. The full-length HSP70 and DnaK mutants were constructed by PCR-based site- directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). All plasmid inserts were verified by DNA sequencing. All HSP70 and DnaK variants were produced with a N-terminal His6-tag in the E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) strain (Invitrogen catalog number C6010-03). The resulting strains were grown at 37°C in LB medium containing 50 μg/mL of carbenicillin (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). At an OD60o about 0.3 to about 0.5, protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl- -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and cells were subsequently grown at 25 °C for about 16 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in the Bugbuster® Master Mix (EMD Millipore Chemicals catalog number 71456-4), supplemented with protease inhibitors, 1 mM diethiothreitol (DTT) and 20 mM imidazole. The His6-tagged fusion proteins were isolated on Ni2+-chelating resins (Ni-NTA Superflow, Qiagen catalog number 30410) by standard procedures. When necessary, size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex® 200 or a Superose® 6 10/300 GL columns (GE Healthcare) analytical column pre-equilibrated with IX Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS - Invitrogen 14190-136), 1 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) or 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7) was used as the final purification step. The purified DnaK proteins were dialyzed thoroughly against IX DPBS with 5 mM DTT at 4°C, for crystallization trials involving the small molecule inhibitor PET- 16. For isothermal titration calorimetry studies, all HSP70 and DnaK variants were dialyzed extensively against the buffers as noted below under the section entitled "Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Studies". The dialyzed proteins were subsequently microcentrifugated at 15,000 x g for 5 min at 4°C and aliquots of the soluble proteins were stored at -80°C. [0209] The parental HSP70 construct was purchased from the OriGene Technologies, Inc. catalog # SCI 16766. The parental DnaK construct was a published construct generated by Dr. Lila Gierasch (University of Massachusetts Amherst). However, the recombinant proteins derived from both parental constructs failed to co-crystallize with PET- 16. Both DnaK and HSP70 constructs were genetically manipulated/modified to facilitate co-crystallization. The exogenous residues are underlined. Notably, co-crystals of DnaK-PET- 16 were obtained using the purified HIS6-IEGR-DnaK (residues 389-607) protein (SEQ ID NO: 5). In contrast, both DnaK (residues 389-607) protein as well as HIS6-IE-DnaK (residues 389-607) protein failed to co-crystallize with PET- 16 (sequence not shown). Co-crystals of substrate bound HSP70 were obtained using the HIS6-HSP70 (residues 386-616) protein (SEQ ID NO: 6), but not HSP70 (residues 386-616) protein and HIS6-HSP70 (residues 391-615) protein. All plasmid inserts were verified by DNA sequencing at the DNA Sequencing Facility, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. The predicted protein sequences were confirmed by comparison to protein sequences in the NCBI website (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The PET- 16 contacting residues are highlighted in grey. The residues that were added to facilitate co- crystallization are underlined.

The protein mixtures were preheated to 42°C for 15 minutes and gradually cooled to room temperature. The protein preparations were microcentrifugated at 15,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature, and the soluble protein complexes were subjected to the crystallization screening using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The drops were set up with 1 μΐ^ protein plus 1 μΐ^ reservoir solution at room temperature. [0214] Crystals of HIS6-IEGR-DnaK grown in the presence of PET- 16 were obtained from a solution of 1.8 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M Bis-Tris, pH 5.5 at room temperature. The HIS6- IEGR-DnaK-PET- 16 (referred to here as DnaK-PET- 16) crystals were harvested into the reservoir solution with the addition of glycerol (25% v/v) and flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen. [0215] All diffraction data sets were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory) and processed with HKL® 2000 software. The HIS6-IEGR- DnaK-PET- 16 (referred to hereafter as DnaK-PET- 16) data sets were collected on the Beamline™ X25 instrument. The crystal structures were determined by molecular replacement with Phaser® program, using the structure of DnaK-NRLLLTG (PDB code 1DKY) as a search model, with the NRLLLTG peptide (SEQ ID NO: 7) extracted from the search model. The structures of the proteins were refined and manually adjusted using the high resolution native dataset by iterative cycles of refinement with Phenix.refine® (Afonine, 2012), and model building was performed using the Crystallographic Object-Oriented Toolkit program (COOT - Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). The PET- 16 ligand was modeled into the corresponding electron density maps after refinement of the protein had converged. The final model, and the modeled PET- 16 inhibitor, was checked for errors with a composite omit map generated by AutoBuild in the Phenix® suite (Adams, 2010). Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. All the structural figures were prepared using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/) (Delano, 2002).

[0218] (vi) Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Studies [0219] All ITC experiments were performed using a MicroCal VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal). Both full-length HSP70 and DnaK proteins and DnaK (aa 393-507) proteins were prepared in 1 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 3% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The HSP70 (aa 386-616) protein was prepared in buffer containing 3% DMSO and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7. The syringe was loaded with purified protein in either 1 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 3% DMSO or 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7) buffer containing 3% DMSO. The sample cell of the calorimeter was loaded with PES, PET- 16 or NRLLLTG (SEQ ID NO: 7) prepared in the same buffer. All solutions were degassed for 5 min. [0220] The titrations involving the full-length purified proteins were performed at 25°C with injection volumes of 12 μΐ^ and a spacing of 300 s. The titrations involving the purified HSP70 (aa 386-616) and DnaK (aa 393-507) were performed at 42°C with injection volumes of 12 μΐ^ and a spacing of 300 s. Heat from the pre-injection was not used during fitting. The data were fit using a one-site binding model available in the Origin® ITC data analysis software (MicroCal Origin® V5.0, MicroCal Software, Northampton, MA). Error values obtained from the MicroCal Origin® V5.0 software were averaged and reported. [0221] Example 1 : Identification of an effective new small molecule inhibitor of mammalian HSP70 and bacterial DnaK [0222] Using structure-activity relationship assays, an initial small scale screen of related compounds that contain one or more moieties in common with PES/PES-C1 (Fig. ID) was performed. This approach was informative, and pointed to the phenyl group (aromatic moiety) and acetylene linker as key features for the biological activity of these molecules (Fig. 1 A). [0223] This approach was validated and resulted in the design of two analogs that interact with HSP70. Both of these compounds exhibit cytotoxicity values in the very low μΜ range. One such molecule is triphenyl(phenylethynyl)phosphonium bromide (C26H2oBrP; MW 443.327) referred to as PET- 16 (Fig. IE). PET- 16 contains a phenyl group, an acetylene linker and a triphenylphosphine moiety (TPP). To date, no compounds containing the TPP substituent have been reported to bind selectively and directly to DnaK and HSP70. [0224] Based on the X-ray structure of DnaK- PET- 16, two new analogs were designed, synthesized and characterized. These compounds are PET-3C (Fig. IF), which is able to bind to HSP70; and PET-DR (Fig. 1G), which is negative for this ability. [0225] Example 2: Cell viability analysis confirms that PET- 16 is preferentially cytotoxic to tumor cells of diverse origin [0226] It was found that concentrations of PET- 16 that inhibit the viability of a broad range of tumor cell lines have little effect on non-transformed cells, such as fibroblasts or primary melanocytes (Figs. 2A and 2B). For example, the IC5o for PET- 16 in several of the melanoma cell lines examined was about 0.5-1.5 μΜ (Fig. 2A). In addition, because bacteria rely on a functional DnaK system to survive stresses such as elevated temperatures, the effects of PET- 16 on E. coli were tested. It was found that this small molecule impaired bacterial growth (Figs. 2C and 2D); it also caused cell filamentation and reduced viability, a phenotype that is identical to that of many DnaK mutants. In contrast, the TPP moiety alone had little discernible effect on the viability of mammalian tumor cells (Fig. 2B) and had no negative effect on the growth of E. coli (Fig. 2D). [0227] Example 3 : PET- 16 directly binds to a C-terminal region of HSP70 and of DnaK [0228] To assess whether there was a direct molecular interaction between PET- 16 and HSP70/DnaK, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was employed. Full-length recombinant proteins of HSP70 (aa 1-641) as well as DnaK (aa 1-638) were pretreated either with ADP or ATP, to assess the interaction of PET- 16 with different nucleotide -bound states of the protein. In addition to PET- 16, PES and a well-studied, synthesized client protein peptide (NRLLLTG - SEQ ID NO: 7) of HSP70/DnaK, previously shown to complex with a defined canonical substrate binding pocket of the SBD were also assayed. See, Bertelsen, "Solution Confirmation of wild- type E. coli HSP70 (DnaK) Chaperone Complexed with ADP and Substrate", PNAS, 106(21): 8471-8476 (May 26, 2009) and incorporated by reference herein. [0229] ITC analyses revealed that the peptide and the two small molecules PES and PET- 16 exhibit a strong preference for the ADP-bound forms of HSP70, with Kd values of about 10 μΜ, 5.7 μΜ and 3.8 μΜ, respectively, (Figs. 3A-C). Similarly, the interactions of PES and PET-16 with the ADP-bound form of DnaK were determined to be about 6.8 μΜ and about 6 μΜ, respectively, (Figs. 3D and 3E). In contrast, the interaction of the compounds PES and PET-16 with the ATP-bound versions of HSP70 or DnaK was notably reduced (Figs. 3F-H). These data support a model that PET-16 behaves as allosteric modulators that preferentially target the ADP- bound conformation of HSP70/DnaK. [0230] ITC binding curves also indicate that one PET-16 molecule binds in a complex containing two molecules of ADP-bound HSP70/DnaK (Figs. 3C and 3E). PET-16 also binds to the C-terminal domain of HSP70 (residue 386-616), exhibiting a Kd of about 2.9 μΜ (Fig. 31). In contrast, the TPP moiety alone does not bind to either HSP70 or DnaK SBD (Fig. 3J). [0231] Upon performing the ITC analysis, it was discovered that pre-incubation of HSP70 with PES markedly reduced the binding affinity of protein for PET-16 (Fig. 3K). In the converse situation, pre-saturation of HSP70 with PET-16 also impaired the interaction of protein with PES. These data are most consistent with the premise that these chemically related compounds bind to the same site of the HSP70 protein. To further assess this possibility in vivo, biotin-tagged PES (B-PES, Fig. IB) was employed in a pull-down assay. In this assay, cultured tumor cells were pretreated with PET- 16 for 1 h prior to the addition of B-PES. B-PES-containing complexes were then captured using Avidin beads and then examined for the presence of HSP70 by immunoblotting. It was found that pretreating cells with PET- 16 clearly reduced the amount of HSP70 found in complex with B-PES (Fig. 3L); these results are consistent with the ITC data (Fig. 3K), suggesting that the two compounds likely target the same binding site. [0232] Example 4: PET- 16 impairs protein quality control [0233] Using a number of approaches, it was confirmed that binding of PET- 16 to HSP70 would impair proteostasis, as expected for an HSP70 inhibitor. As one example, electron microscopy analysis (EM) of cells treated with this compound provides evidence of altered autophagy and impaired proteostasis (Fig. 4A). The evidence includes (i) the appearance of multiple single- and double -membrane structures indicative of altered autophagy (ii) an accumulation of multiple vacuoles, (iii) the appearance of granular and aggregated masses within vacuoles and throughout the cell, and (iv) loss of membrane structures and mitochondria. In addition, western blot analysis revealed an increase in the appearance of the autophagy marker, processed LC3II, following treatment of cells with PET- 16 (Figs. 4B and AC). [0234] This data also demonstrates that treating cells with PET- 16 also leads to reduced interactions between HSP70 and many client/substrate proteins. This is illustrated by immunoprecipitation-western blot (IP-WB) analysis; here whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to HSP70, and co-precipitating proteins visualized by Coomassie staining. It is evident that PET- 16 treatment results in loss of interactions between HSP70 and many polypeptides (Figs. 4D and 4E). [0235] An inhibition of the chaperone functions of HSP70 by PET- 16 is expected to alter the localization and/or stability of many client proteins, promoting functional inactivation. For example, mutations in the BRAF protein kinase frequently occur in tumors such as melanoma. The mutant form of this protein is an HSP70 client protein. It was demonstrated by western blot analysis that protein samples from PET- 16 treated melanoma tumor cells exhibit a reduction in expression of BRAF(V600E) protein abundance in the soluble fraction; this was accompanied by a notable increase of the protein in the detergent-insoluble fraction, indicative of functional inactivation. These data support the conclusion that by interacting with HSP70, PET- 16 alters key chaperone functions of this cancer-critical survival protein, contributing to death of tumor cells. In addition to BRAF(V600E), PET- 16 leads to altered expression of several other proteins (such as Integrin β 1 , AKT and EGFR) and mitochondrial proteins (such as Hexokinase II, Cyclophilin D and Cytochrome C) (Figs. 4F-I); this is indicative of impaired overall cellular proteostasis. [0236] Moreover, activation of cytokine signaling pathways, including those regulated by STAT proteins (signal transducer and activators of transcription) is associated with the initiation, progression and drug resistance of many tumor types, such as melanomas. STAT3 and STAT1 activation can occur in response to cytokines like IL-6. It was found that IL-6 promotes phosphorylation of both of these proteins in many of the melanoma cell lines that were examined. Notably, in each case examined, an IL-6 mediated phosphorylation of these proteins is inhibited by pre-treating the cells with PET- 16. Representative data are in Fig. 4J, for STAT3, and similar results were obtained for STAT1. These results provide evidence that inhibiting HSP70 by PET- 16 impairs the function of these critical signaling factors. [0237] Lysosomes contain a number of enzymes, including cathepsin proteases that help in the turnover of macromolecules and organelles during normal metabolism and during autophagy. To further explore the effects of PET- 16 on autophagic flux, the expression of the lysosomal cysteine peptidase cathepsin L, which plays an important role in the degradation of lysosomal cargo, was examined. Like other members of this protein family, cathepsin L is synthesized as an inactive precursor that undergoes proteolytic processing to the mature, active form during transport to the acidic environment of the endosomal/lysosomal compartment through autoprocessing or cleavage by other cathepsins. It was found that PET- 16 caused an accumulation of the precursor procathepsin L and a markedly reduced abundance of the smaller, mature form of the enzyme (Fig. 4K); this points to an impaired processing of this lysosomal enzyme and impaired lysosomal function needed for the process of autophagy. [0238] Because ubiquitin often serves as a covalent tag to mark proteins for degradation, an accumulation of ubiquitinated polypeptides also is indicative of impaired proteostasis. Here, too, immunoblot analysis of lysates from PET- 16 treated cells reveals an accumulation of a heterogeneous population of ubiquitinated polypeptides, especially in the detergent insoluble cell fraction (Fig. 4L). [0239] Example 5: PET- 16 inhibits HSP70-client Cyclophilin D and reduces ATP production in tumor cells [0240] Although a significant fraction of HSP70 protein resides in the cytoplasm, it also has documented roles in the nucleus, plasma membrane, lysosomes, and it is found extracellularly. It is known that the stress-inducible HSP70 is an ARF-interacting protein in the mitochondria of tumor cells. However, its potential activities at that location have not been investigated. Mitochondria are key factors in the regulation of cell death pathways, metabolism and energy generation, including ATP production. Consequently, a sustained disruption of the structural and functional integrity of these organelles is cytotoxic. PET- 16, which contains the mitochondrial targeting motif TPP, was utilized to begin to address an important unresolved aspect of HSP70 biology and tumor pathology, namely its potential role in mitochondria. [0241] This investigation was initiated by using subcellular fractionation assays to isolate mitochondria from several human tumor cell lines. During the course of these studies, a number of cell lines were utilized to assure consistency, and the results obtained have been reproducible among all cell lines sampled. As an example, western blot analyses of mitochondrial proteins isolated from the HI 299 lung, and the MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic, carcinoma cell lines confirmed that a fraction of the stress-inducible HSP70 protein is constitutively present in these tumor cell organelles (Figs. 5A-C). In contrast to tumor cells, normal cells lack appreciable levels of HSP70 in both the mitochondria and cytoplasmic preparations; this is illustrated by western blot analysis of proteins isolated from normal mouse liver (Figs. 5C and 5D). As normal cells have very little, if any, HSP70 protein expressed, this provides a therapeutic window for treating tumor cells by preferentially targeting this molecular chaperone, HSP70. As some of the controls for the integrity of the mitochondrial fractions, western blot analysis was performed for the mitochondrial chaperone GRP75 (mortalin, HSPA9) and the outer mitochondrial membrane protein BAK. Both GRP75 and BAK were readily detected in the mitochondrial fractions from tumor and normal cells. Consistent with previous studies, the data also show that the constitutively expressed 90 kDa molecular chaperone, HSP90, is present at relatively low levels in most normal mitochondria, but is abundantly present in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria of tumor cells (Figs. 5C and 5D). HSP105 exhibits a similar pattern to that of HSP90 (Fig. 5D). Such data are part of accumulating evidence that, while molecular chaperones generally serve compartment-specific, perhaps non-redundant, roles in unstressed normal cells, some of these proteins are differentially exploited in tumor cells likely to oversee critical protein homeostasis within certain organelles. [0242] Cyclophilin D (Cyp-D) binds to the mitochondrial molecular motor F0Fi-ATP synthase; the latter catalyzes the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate. Cyp-D also modulates the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), a well-characterized key effector of mitochondrial-mediated cell death. Purified mitochondria prepared from HI 299 lung carcinoma cell line was incubated with increasing amounts of PET- 16 or PES. PET- 16, but not DMSO or PES, significantly reduced the abundance of Cyp-D in the soluble -protein fraction (Fig. 5E), consistent with functional inactivation. PET- 16 exposure lead to a clear decrease in cellular ATP levels in tumor cells, indicative of impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics (Fig. 5F). In contrast, primary melanocytes and nontransformed human fibroblasts (IMR90) exhibited no decrease in total ATP levels (Fig. 5F). These results indicate that PET- 16 impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics in tumor cells, but not that of normal cells. [0243] Example 6: PET- 16 synergizes with BRAF inhibitors [0244] The BRAF protein is involved in sending signals inside cells, which are involved in directing cell growth. Mutations in the serine -threonine kinase BRAF occur frequently in many human cancers, contributing to tumorigenesis. While mutant BRAF(V600E)-selective inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy, most patients eventually develop drug resistance. Interestingly, many of the signaling mediators that have been implicated in development of BRAF inhibitor acquired and intrinsic resistance are clients of the HSP70 chaperone machinery. [0245] It was determined if a combination of PET- 16 together with a BRAF-inhibitor will synergize to enhance melanoma tumor cell death. It was then confirmed that PET- 16 is able to synergize with PLX4032 (Vemurafenib), a V600 mutant BRAF inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of late-stage melanoma (Fig. 6). In contrast, PES-C1 did not synergize with PLX4032 (Vemurafenib) (Fig. 6). [0246] Example 7: PET- 16 impairs metastasis in a metastatic mouse model of melanoma [0247] The inhibitory effect of PET- 16 on metastasis was tested in vivo, a well-recognized pulmonary metastatic model was utilized in which immunocompetent, wild-type C57BL/6 mice were injected with the highly metastatic mouse melanoma cell line B16 (Fig. 7). These results illustrate that PET- 16 significantly reduced the extent of lung metastases and may have benefit as an anti-metastatic agent. [0248] Example 8: Crystallographic data on the DnaK-SBD in complex with PET- 16 [0249] Although several HSP70 compounds that interact with the N-terminal NBD domain of HSP70 have been identified, there is essentially no X-ray co-crystallographic data on HSP70 proteins complexed with small molecule modulators that specifically bind to the C-terminal domain of HSP70. Such data are needed to provide additional insight about mechanisms of HSP70-client interaction, occurring at the C-terminus. To better understand the structural basis for how these small molecules target the C-terminus of HSP70/DnaK, crystals of protein-inhibitor complexes suitable for analysis by X-ray crystallography were generated. Accordingly crystals of the SBD of DnaK (aa 389-607) were obtained in the presence of PET- 16 in the P432i2 space group. The crystals contained two molecules (referred to as Molecule A (MolA) and Molecule B (MolB)) per asymmetric unit cell and diffracted to a nominal resolution of 3.45 A (Fig. 8A). Both molecules are highly similar to previously determined DnaK SBD structures, each containing the canonical SBDP (residues 393-507) and SBDa. During and following refinement, additional difference density was detected in MolB, but not MolA, that occupies a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues in strand βΐ (L399) and loops LL,1 (L392 and P396), L6,7 (G482) and La,p (A503 and S504) of the DnaK-PET- 16 complex (Figs. 8A-C). This PET-16 binding pocket in the DnaK-PET- 16 complex corresponds to a hydrophobic cleft flanked by residues located on strands βΐ (L401) and β7 (G484) and loops LL, 1 (L394 and P398) and La,P (N505 and D506) of the SBDP subdomain of the human stress-inducible HSP70 (Fig. 8D). Notably, this additional electron density in MolB of the DnaK-PET- 16 complex was modeled as PET- 16, with the electron-rich phosphine in the region of greatest electron density and the phenyl group and acetylene linker pointing into the hydrophobic pocket and the TPP pointing out towards solvent, which was consistent with additional rounds of crystallographic refinement (Figs. 8B and 8C). Also, in MolB, the interaction between the modeled PET-16 and loops LL,1 and La,P brings residue L392 closer to residues A503 and S504 by about 3.5 A and about 3.1 A, respectively, relative to their positions in MolA. Since loop La,P bridges SBDP to SBDa and that the loop LL,1 connects NBD to SBDP, it is reasonable to speculate that the interaction of PET-16 with this particular region may impede the conformational flexibility, and NBD-SBD crosstalk, needed for proper chaperone function. Indeed, as discussed above (Fig. 4), PET- 16 reduces the cellular interactions between HSP70 and substrates. Taken together, our crystallographic data unveiled a previously unrecognized allosteric pocket in the C-terminal domain of DnaK/HSP70 molecule; this binding site does not overlap with the canonical substrate peptide -binding pocket. [0250] Example 9: Mutational analysis supports the site of interaction of PET- 16 with DnaK and HSP70 [0251] The information from crystal structure analysis pointed to particular amino acid residues as potential contact sites for interaction with PET- 16. Single point mutants were thereby introduced in the context of a full-length DnaK protein, as well as at the corresponding residues within HSP70; these mutant proteins were analyzed by ITC for ability to bind to PET- 16. The DnaK mutations included residues L392D, P396L, L399R, G482D, A503D and S504A; those in HSP70 were L394D, P398L, L401R, G484D, N505D and D506A. As used herein, a change in an amino acid in a sequence is denoted by the original amino acid, followed by its amino acid number in the sequence, and finally followed by the amino acid change in the sequence. For example, L392D refers to replacement of the Leu (L) at amino acid position 392 with Asp (D). [0252] Based on ITC analysis (Tables 2A and 2B), the presence of each of these mutations reduced the affinity of the proteins for interaction with PET- 16; an interaction between HSP70/DnaK and the small molecule was most notably impaired by mutations in loop La,P (A503D and S504A in DnaK; N505D and D506A in HSP70) and the SBDp site (P396L, L399R and G482D in DnaK; P398L, L401R and G484D in HSP70). Tables 2A and 2B provide data which illustrates the binding of PET- 16 directly to C-terminal substrate binding domain of ADP- bound DnaK and ADP-bound HSP70. Shown are the ITC-derived binding constants (Kd values) from assays of PET- 16 incubated with wild-type and mutated full-length ADP-DnaK (Table 2A) and ADP-HSP70 proteins (Table 2B). There is an impaired interaction between PET- 16 and ATP -bound HSP70 (Table 2B). These data provide additional support for the previously unidentified modulatory binding site of PET- 16 within the C-terminal domain of DnaK (Figs. 8A- C) and HSP70 (Fig. 8D). [0253] Amino acids L392, P396, L399, G482, A503, and S504 are key residues that contact PET- 16 in DnaK. The former four residues are conserved and correspond to residues L394, P398, L401, and G484 in HSP70. Like A503 and S504 in DnaK, residues N505 and D506 in HSP70 also form the entrance to a conserved inhibitor binding pocket. In sum, the data obtained in these mutagenesis studies described herein and in Leu et al, 2014, cited herein and incorporated by reference, support the information provided by the X-ray crystal structure of DnaK-PET-16; they suggest that residues L394, P398, L401, G484, N505, and D506 in HSP70, as well as the corresponding residues in DnaK, represent important elements for the interaction of PET- 16 and PES. Table 2A Table 2B [0254] Example 10: Identification of a novel PET- 16 analog [0255] Based on data from X-ray crystallography analyses, PET- 16 was modified to generate a novel analog, referred to here as PET-3C (Fig. IF). An additional analog, referred to here as PET-DR (Fig. 1G) that is predicted to be too bulky to bind to the identified PET- 16 hydrophobic groove, was also generated. Using ITC, it was confirmed that PET-3C preferentially interacted with the ADP-HSP70 with a with Kd value of about 4.9 μΜ (Fig. 9A); in contrast, this analog exhibits notably reduced interaction with the ATP -bound conformation of HSP70 (Fig. 9B). Interestingly, and in contrast to PET- 16, PET-3C binds much less well to DnaK under the same conditions (compare Figs. 9C and 3E). PET-3C preferentially kills tumor cells relative to non- transformed cells (Fig. 9D), consistent with its ability to bind to HSP70. It is much less effective in inhibiting E. coli growth (Figs. 9E and 9F), a property that is consistent with its impaired interaction with ADP-bound DnaK (Fig. 9C). The compound PET-DR does not exhibit a good binding affinity for HSP70 or DnaK (Figs. 9G and 9H). PET-DR is also not effectively cytotoxic for tumor cells and has little effect on E. coli. Mutagenesis studies in conjunction with isothermal titration calorimetry provided additional support that PET-3C binds to the same hydrophobic pocket as PET- 16 (Table 3). Interactions between HSP70 and PET-3C were markedly impaired by mutations L394D, P398L, L401R, G484D, N505D and D506A in HSP70. [0256] Specifically, Table 3 provides data illustrating that PET-3C binds to the PET- 16 hydrophobic pocket located in the C-terminal domain of HSP70. ITC-derived binding constants (Kd values) from assays of PET-3C incubated with wild-type and mutated full-length ADP- HSP70 proteins are provided. There is impaired interaction between PET-3C and ATP-bound HSP70, between PET-DR and ADP-HSP70, and between PET-DR and ATP-HSP70. [0257] Table 3 ATP-HSP70 PET-3C (Kd, μΜ) PET-DR (Kd, μΜ) WT 71.7 + 4.8 191 ± 38 [0258] In conclusion, we generated crystals of the C terminal domain of DnaK, both alone and in complex with either a peptide substrate or inhibitor. Our data provide evidence that the small molecule PET- 16, described herein, represents an inhibitor class that binds within a conserved C- terminal binding pocket of the HSP70 and DnaK proteins; this pocket is distinct from the site of chaperone-substrate interaction and is evident only in the non-ATP-bound protein conformation. Changes in local protein environment are apparent in the PET- 16-bound versus unbound state. Previous investigations, using either mutation analyses or structural studies, have established the importance of the residues within loops LL, 1 , L6,7, and ί ,β of DnaK for allosteric coupling of NBD and SBD, the interaction of chaperone with the critical HSP40 cochaperone, or overall bacterial viability. By binding to this well-conserved C-terminal binding pocket, the inhibitors disrupt the conformational flexibility between the SBDa-SBD and/or NBD-SBD interface needed for allosteric regulation and proper chaperone function. These small molecules reduce the survival of mammalian tumor cells, impair bacterial growth, modulate cellular interactions between HSP70 and cochaperones, and alter interactions with substrates. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the combined data support that by locking (or prolonging) HSP70 and DnaK in a particular conformational state, these small molecules negatively impact the substrate binding/release cycle of HSP70 and DnaK allostery. Indeed, the inhibitors may function in a manner that may impart a "gain-of- function" phenotype, resulting in the accumulation of aggregates and misfolded proteins in detergent insoluble cell fractions, optionally in association with the chaperone itself. Also, while PES and PET- 16 share many properties, ongoing investigations point to differences as well. It is anticipated that the various mutant forms of DnaK and HSP70 generated in this investigation, as well as the inhibitor compounds described, will have direct utility for future in vitro and in vivo studies aimed at dissecting the role of the binding region and particular amino acid residues in chaperone activities, such as allostery regulation, substrate binding/release, and interaction with particular cochaperone mediators. The compositions and methods described herein represent a timely and useful molecular platform to inform the structure-based design of additional modulators that preferentially target the C- terminal binding pocket of HSP70 and DnaK proteins to alter the chaperone-client network, with application to human disease.
