Polymers and Organic Electronic Devices Background of the Invention Electronic devices containing active organic materials are attracting increasing attention for use in devices such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photoresponsive devices (in particular organic photovoltaic devices and organic photosensors), organic transistors and memory array devices. Devices containing active organic materials offer benefits such as low weight, low power consumption and flexibility. Moreover, use of soluble organic materials allows use of solution processing in device manufacture, for example inkjet printing or spin-coating. An OLED may comprise a substrate carrying an anode, a cathode and one or more organic light-emitting layers between the anode and cathode. Holes are injected into the device through the anode and electrons are injected through the cathode during operation of the device. Holes in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and electrons in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of a light-emitting material combine to form an exciton that releases its energy as light. Suitable light-emitting materials include small molecule, polymeric and dendrimeric materials. Suitable light-emitting polymers include poly(arylene vinylenes) such as poly(p-phenylene vinylenes) and polyarylenes such as polyfluorenes. A light emitting layer may comprise a semiconducting host material and a light-emitting dopant wherein energy is transferred from the host material to the light-emitting dopant. For example, J. Appl. Phys. 65, 3610, 1989 discloses a host material doped with a fluorescent light-emitting dopant (that is, a light-emitting material in which light is emitted via decay of a singlet exciton). Phosphorescent dopants are also known (that is, a light-emitting dopant in which light is emitted via decay of a triplet exciton). A hole-transporting layer may be provided between the anode and light-emitting layer of an OLED.

In an embodiment, the polymer comprising repeats unit of formulae (I) and (II) is provided in a hole-transporting layer that is adjacent to a light-emitting layer of the device. If a hole-transporting layer comprising a polymer comprising repeats unit of formulae (I) and (II) is provided adjacent to a light-emitting layer containing a fluorescent light-emitting material then the lowest singlet excited state (Si) energy level of the polymer is preferably no more than 0.1 eV below that of the fluorescent light-emitting material, preferably at least the same as or higher than that of the fluorescent light-emitting material, in order to avoid quenching of fluorescent light emitted by the fluorescent light-emitting material.

If a hole-transporting layer comprising a polymer comprising repeats unit of formulae (I) and (II) is provided adjacent to a light-emitting layer containing a phosphorescent light-emitting material then the lowest triplet excited state (Τΐ) energy level of the polymer is preferably no more than 0.1 eV below that of the phosphorescent light-emitting material, preferably at least the same as or higher than that of the phosphorescent light-emitting material, in order to avoid quenching of phosphorescent light emitted by the phosphorescent light-emitting material. Τΐ of a material may be measured by measuring energy of the peak of the fluorescence spectrum of the material. The triplet energy level may be measured by low temperature phosphorescence spectroscopy (Y.V. Romaovskii et al, Physical Review Letters, 2000, 85 (5), ρ1027,Α. van Dijken et al, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 2004, 126, ρ7718). The layer containing the polymer comprising repeats unit of formulae (I) and (II) may consist essentially of that polymer or may contain one or more further components. The repeat unit of formula (I) contains a fused aromatic or heteroaromatic group Ar3. It will be appreciated that a fused aromatic or heteroaromatic group Ar3 may provide a greater degree of conjugation than an unfused group, for example phenyl. The fused aromatic or heteroaromatic group Ar3 may provide a shallower HOMO than a material in which phenyl is used in place of Ar3. Optionally, Ar3 is a group of formula (III): wherein R6 in each occurrence is independently Η or a substituent; R7 in each occurrence is independently a substituent; χ is 0, 1, 2 or 3; y is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4; and * represents a point of attachment to the Ν atom of the repeat unit of formula (I). The group of formula (III) may have formula (Ilia): Optionally, Ar3 is a group of formula (XII): Optionally, Ar3 is a group of formula (XIII): wherein R7 independently in each occurrence is a substituent and f, g and h are as described above with reference to formula (XII). Optionally, Ar3 is a group of formula (XIV): wherein R7 independently in each occurrence is a substituent; f and h are as described above with reference to formula (XII); and two groups R7 bound to the central ring of formula (XIV) may be linked to form a ring that may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents. An exemplary group of formula (XIV) has formula (XIVa): Wherein R8 independently in each occurrence is a substituent, optionally C1-20 alkyl, and each j is independently 0, 1, 2 or 3. In an embodiment, m = 0. In an embodiment, m = 1 or 2, with the proviso that Ar2 is not phenanthrene if m is 1. If m = 1 or 2 then each R may independently be an unsubstituted or substituted aryl or heteroaryl group, for example a phenyl group that may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents such as one or more C1-20 alkyl groups, or may be Ar3 as described above. If m = 1 or 2 then each Ar2 may independently be an unsubstituted or substituted aryl other than phenanthrene or heteroaryl group, and may be unsubstituted phenyl, or phenyl substituted with one or more substituents, for example one or more C1-20 alkyl groups. Optionally each R6 is a Ci_4ohydrocarbyl. Optionally each R7, in the case where at least one of χ, y, f, g and h is at least 1, is a Ci_4o hydrocarbyl. Exemplary Ci-40 hydrocarbyl groups R6 and R7 include C1-20 alkyl, and phenyl that may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more Ci_2o alkyl groups. Exemplary repeat units of formula (I) include the following: Optionally, the polymer comprises 1-50 mol % of repeat units of formula (I). Optionally, Ar1 is phenyl that may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents The groups Ar1 of a repeat unit of formula (I) may be the same or different. The repeat unit of formula (II) contains a substituent R10 adjacent to at least one linking position of the repeat unit. The substituent R10 creates steric hindrance with the group that the repeat unit of formula (II) is adjacent to, resulting in a twist between the repeat unit of formula (II) and the adjacent group. This twist reduces the conjugation along the polymer backbone as compared to a polymer in which substituents R10 are not present. Optionally, each R10 is selected from the group consisting of Ci_4ohydrocarbyl and a heteroaromatic group that may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents. Exemplary hydrocarbyl groups include C1-20 alkyl; alkylaryl; unsubstituted phenyl; and phenyl substituted with one or more C1-20 alkyl groups. Exemplary groups R9 include: alkyl, optionally C1-20 alkyl, wherein one or more non-adjacent C atoms may be replaced with optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl, O, S, substituted Ν, C=0 or -C00-, and one or more Η atoms may be replaced with F; aryl and heteroaryl groups that may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents, preferably phenyl substituted with one or more Ci_2o alkyl groups; a linear or branched chain of aryl or heteroaryl groups, each of which groups may independently be substituted, for example a group of formula -(Ar3)r wherein each Ar3 is independently an aryl or heteroaryl group and r is at least 2, preferably a branched or linear chain of phenyl groups Ar3, each of which may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more C1-20 alkyl groups; and a crosslinkable-group, for example a group comprising a double bond such and a vinyl or acrylate group, or a benzocyclobutane group. Substituted Ν, where present, may be -NR2- wherein R2 is C1-20 alkyl; unsubstituted phenyl; or phenyl substituted with one or more C1-20 alkyl groups. Optionally, each R9 is a Ci_4o hydrocarbyl. Exemplary hydrocarbyl groups include C1-20 alkyl; unsubstituted phenyl; and phenyl substituted with one or more Ci_2o alkyl groups. Optionally, the polymer comprises 1-90 mol % of repeat units of formula (II). The groups R of a repeat unit of formula (I) may be the same or different. Preferred groups R are Ci-40 hydrocarbyl, for example C1-20 alkyl; unsubstituted phenyl; and phenyl substituted with one or more C1-20 alkyl groups. The polymer may comprise repeat units of formula (I) adj acent to repeat units of formula (II), and the ratios of monomers used to form units of formulae (I) and (II) and / or the polymerisation method used to form the polymer may be selected to produce such adjacent repeat units. Co-repeat units Polymers of the invention may contain repeat units of formula (I) and (II) and one or more co-repeat units. Exemplary co-repeat units include arylene repeat units, for example ℓ,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-phenylene repeat units, 3,6- and 2,7- linked fluorene repeat units, indenofluorene, naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene repeat units, each of which may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents, for example one or more Ci-40 hydrocarbyl substituents. The polymer may comprise one or more crosslinkable repeat units. Crosslinkable groups of a crosslinkable repeat unit may be provided as a substituent of a repeat unit of formula (I) or (II), or as a substituent of a co-repeat unit. The polymer is preferably at least partially conjugated, and repeat units of formula (I) and (II) are preferably directly linked to aromatic or heteroaromatic groups of adjacent co-repeat units. One preferred class of arylene repeat units is phenylene repeat units, such as phenylene repeat units of formula (III): wherein ρ in each occurrence is independently 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, optionally 1 or 2; η is 1, 2 η (III) or 3; and R1 independently in each occurrence is a substituent. Where present, each R1 may independently be selected from the group consisting of: alkyl, optionally Ci_2o alkyl, wherein one or more non-adjacent C atoms may be replaced with optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl, O, S, substituted Ν, C=0 or -C00-, and one or more Η atoms may be replaced with F; aryl and heteroaryl groups that may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents, preferably phenyl substituted with one or more C1-20 alkyl groups; a linear or branched chain of aryl or heteroaryl groups, each of which groups may independently be substituted, for example a group of formula -(Ar3)r wherein each Ar3 is independently an aryl or heteroaryl group and r is at least 2, preferably a branched or linear chain of phenyl groups each of which may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more Ci_2o alkyl groups; and a crosslinkable-group, for example a group comprising a double bond such and a vinyl or acrylate group, or a benzocyclobutane group. Substituted Ν, where present, may be -NR2- wherein R2 is C1-20 alkyl; unsubstituted phenyl; or phenyl substituted with one or more Ci_2o alkyl groups. Preferably, each R1 is independently selected from Ci_4ohydrocarbyl, and is more preferably selected from C1-20 alkyl; unusubstituted phenyl; and phenyl substituted with one or more C1-20 alkyl groups. If η is 1 then exemplary repeat units of formula (III) include the following: If the repeat unit of formula (III) is 1,4-linked and if ρ is 0 then the extent of conjugation of repeat unit of formula (III) to one or both adjacent repeat units may be relatively high. If ρ is at least 1, and / or the repeat unit is 1,2- or 1,3 linked, then the extent of conjugation of repeat unit of formula (III) to one or both adjacent repeat units may be relatively low. In one preferred arrangement, the repeat unit of formula (III) is 1,3-linked and ρ is 0, 1, 2 or 3. In another preferred arrangement, the repeat unit of formula (III) has formula (Ilia): Substituents R1 of formula (Ilia) are adjacent to linking positions of the repeat unit, which may cause steric hindrance between the repeat unit of formula (Ilia) and adjacent repeat units, resulting in the repeat unit of formula (Ilia) twisting out of plane relative to one or both adjacent repeat units. Exemplary repeat units where η is 2 or 3 include the following: A preferred repeat unit has formula (Illb): The two R1 groups of formula (Illb) may cause steric hindrance between the phenyl rings they are bound to, resulting in twisting of the two phenyl rings relative to one another. A further class of arylene repeat units are optionally substituted fluorene repeat units, such as repeat units of formula (IV): wherein R9 independently in each occurrence is as described with reference to formula (II), and wherein the two groups R9 may be linked to form a ring. Repeat units of formula (IV) differ from repeat units of formula (II) in that aromatic carbon atoms of the repeat unit of formula (IV) are unsubstituted. The repeat unit of formula (IV) may be an optionally substituted 2,7-linked repeat unit. The extent of conjugation of repeat units of formulae (IV) may be limited by linking the repeat unit through the 3- and / or 6- positions to limit the extent of conjugation across the repeat unit.

Another exemplary arylene repeat unit has formula (V): to form an more Ci-2o alkyl groups. wherein each R3 is Η or a substituent, and any two groups R3 may be linked unsubstituted or substituted ring, for example a ring substituted with one or Each R3 may independently be selected from the group consisting of: alkyl, optionally Ci_2o alkyl, wherein one or more non-adjacent C atoms may be replaced with optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl, O, S, substituted Ν, C=0 or -C00-, and one or more Η atoms may be replaced with F; aryl and heteroaryl groups that may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents, preferably phenyl substituted with one or more C1-20 alkyl groups; a linear or branched chain of aryl or heteroaryl groups, each of which groups may independently be substituted, for example a group of formula -(Ar3)r wherein each Ar3 is independently an aryl or heteroaryl group and r is at least 2, preferably a branched or linear chain of phenyl groups Ar3, each of which may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more Ci_2o alkyl groups; and a crosslinkable-group, for example a group comprising a double bond such as a vinyl or acrylate group, or a benzocyclobutane group. In the case where R3 comprises an aryl or heteroaryl group, or a linear or branched chain of aryl or heteroaryl groups, the or each aryl or heteroaryl group may be substituted with one or more substituents R4 selected from the group consisting of: alkyl, for example C1-20 alkyl, wherein one or more non-adjacent C atoms may be replaced with 0, S, substituted Ν, C=0 and -COO- and one or more Η atoms of the alkyl group may be replaced with F; NR52, OR5, SR5, and fluorine, nitro and cyano; wherein each R5 is independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl, preferably Ci_2o alkyl; and aryl or heteroaryl, preferably phenyl, optionally substituted with one or more Ci-20 alkyl groups. Substituted Ν, where present, may be -NR2- wherein R2 is C1-20 alkyl; unsubstituted phenyl; or phenyl substituted with one or more C1-20 alkyl groups. Preferably, each R3 is independently selected from Ci_4ohydrocarbyl, and is more preferably selected from C1-20 alkyl; unusubstituted phenyl; phenyl substituted with one or more C1-20 alkyl groups; a linear or branched chain of phenyl groups, wherein each phenyl may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents; and a crosslinkable group. Aromatic carbon atoms of the repeat unit of formula (V) may be unsubstituted, or may be substituted with one or more substituents. Exemplary substituents are alkyl, for example Ci-20 alkyl, wherein one or more non-adjacent C atoms may be replaced with O, S, ΝΗ or substituted Ν, C=0 and -C00-, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted heteroaryl, alkoxy, alkylthio, fluorine, cyano and arylalkyl. Particularly preferred substituents include Ci_2o alkyl and substituted or unsubstituted aryl, for example phenyl. Optional substituents for the aryl include one or more C1-20 alkyl groups. Further arylene co-repeat units include: phenanthrene repeat units; naphthalene repeat units; anthracene repeat units; and perylene repeat units. Each of these arylene repeat units may be linked to adjacent repeat units through any two of the aromatic carbon atoms of these units. Specific exemplary linkages include 9,10-anthracene; 2,6-anthracene; 1,4-naphthalene; 2,6-naphthalene; 2,7-phenanthrene; and 2,5-perylene. Each of these repeat units may be substituted or unsubstituted, for example substituted with one or more Ci_4ohydrocarbyl groups. Co-repeat units may contain only aromatic or heteroaromatic groups in the repeat unit backbone, for example as described above with respect to formulae (III), (IV) and (V), or may contain non-aromatic or heteroaromatic groups in the repeat unit backbone, for example a repeat unit of formula (XII): -(Ar11-Sp1-Ar11)- (XII) wherein Ar11 in each occurrence independently represents a substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl group; and Sp1 represents a spacer group that does not provide any conjugation path between the two groups Ar11. Sp1 may contain a single non-conjugating atom only between the two groups Ar11, or Sp1 may contain non-conjugating chain of at least 2 atoms separating the two groups Ar11. A non-conjugating atom may be, for example, -0-, -S-, -CRU2- or -SiRH2- wherein R11 in each occurrence is Η or a substituent, optionally Ci_2o alkyl. A spacer chain Sp1 may contain two or more atoms separating the two groups Arx\ for example a C1-20 alkyl chain wherein one or more non-adjacent C atoms of the chain may be replaced with 0 or S. Preferably, the spacer chain Sp1 contains at least one sp3-hybridised carbon atom separating the two groups Ar11. Preferred groups Sp1 are selected from C1-20 alkyl wherein one or more non-adjacent C atoms may be replaced with 0. Non conjugating repeat units may make up to 20 mol % of the repeat units of the polymer, optionally up to 10 mol % or up to 5 mol %. Polymer synthesis Polymers comprising repeat units of formula (I) and (II) may be prepared by “metal insertion” polymerisation wherein the metal atom of a metal complex catalyst is inserted between an aryl or heteroaryl group and a leaving group of a monomer. Exemplary metal insertion methods are Suzuki polymerisation as described in, for example, WO 00/53656 and Yamamoto polymerisation as described in, for example, Τ. Yamamoto, "Electrically Conducting And Thermally Stable pi-Conjugated Poly(arylene)s Prepared by Organometallic Processes", Progress in Polymer Science 1993, 17, 1153-1205. In the case of Yamamoto polymerisation, a nickel complex catalyst is used; in the case of Suzuki polymerisation, a palladium complex catalyst is used. For example, in the synthesis of a linear polymer by Yamamoto polymerisation, a monomer having two reactive halogen groups is used. Similarly, according to the method of Suzuki polymerisation, at least one reactive group is a boron derivative group such as a boronic acid or boronic ester and the other reactive group is a halogen. Preferred halogens are chlorine, bromine and iodine, most preferably bromine. It will therefore be appreciated that repeat units illustrated throughout this application may be derived from a monomer carrying suitable leaving groups. Likewise, an endcapping group or side group carrying only one reactive leaving group may be bound to the polymer by reaction of a leaving group at the polymer chain end or side respectively, and monomers containing more than two reactive groups may be used to form branching points in the polymer. Suzuki polymerisation may be used to prepare regioregular, block and random copolymers. In particular, homopolymers or random copolymers may be prepared when one reactive group is a halogen and the other reactive group is a boron derivative group. Alternatively, block or regioregular copolymers may be prepared when both reactive groups of a first monomer are boron and both reactive groups of a second monomer are halogen. The polymerization method may be selected to control the locations of repeat units relative to one another. The number of moles of repeat units of formula (I) and (II) may be selected according to the desired amount of adjacent units of formula (I) and (II). For example, if at least 50 mol % of the monomers of a polymerization mixture consist of boronic acid monomers for forming repeat units of formula (II), and if repeat units of formula (I) are formed from halogenated monomers then all repeat units of formula (I) in the resultant polymer will be adjacent to a repeat unit of formula (II). As alternatives to halides, other leaving groups capable of participating in metal insertion include sulfonic acids and sulfonic acid esters such as tosylate, mesylate and triflate.

Suitable light-emitting materials for a light-emitting layer include polymeric, small molecule and dendrimeric light-emitting materials, each of which may be fluorescent or phosphorescent. A light-emitting layer of an OLED may be unpatterned, or may be patterned to form discrete pixels. Each pixel may be further divided into subpixels. The light-emitting layer may contain a single light-emitting material, for example for a monochrome display or other monochrome device, or may contain materials emitting different colours, in particular red, green and blue light-emitting materials for a full-colour display. A light-emitting layer may contain a mixture of more than one light-emitting material, for example a mixture of light-emitting materials that together provide white light emission. A blue light emitting material may have a photoluminescent spectrum with a peak in the range of 400-490 nm. A green light emitting material may have a photoluminescent spectrum with a peak in the range of more than 490nm up to 580 nm.

Other ligands suitable for use with d-block elements include diketonates, in particular acetylacetonate (acac); triarylphosphines and pyridine, each of which may be substituted. Exemplary substituents include groups R13 as described above with reference to Formula (VI). Particularly preferred substituents include fluorine or trifluoromethyl which may be used to blue-shift the emission of the complex, for example as disclosed in WO 02/45466, WO 02/44189, US 2002-117662 and US 2002-182441; alkyl or alkoxy groups, for example Ci_2o alkyl or alkoxy, which may be as disclosed in JP 2002-324679; carbazole which may be used to assist hole transport to the complex when used as an emissive material, for example as disclosed in WO 02/81448; bromine, chlorine or iodine which can serve to functionalise the ligand for attachment of further groups, for example as disclosed in WO 02/68435 and ΕΡ 1245659; and dendrons which may be used to obtain or enhance solution processability of the metal complex, for example as disclosed in WO 02/66552. A light-emitting dendrimer typically comprises a light-emitting core bound to one or more dendrons, wherein each dendron comprises a branching point and two or more dendritic branches. Preferably, the dendron is at least partially conjugated, and at least one of the branching points and dendritic branches comprises an aryl or heteroaryl group, for example a phenyl group. In one arrangement, the branching point group and the branching groups are all phenyl, and each phenyl may independently be substituted with one or more substituents, for example alkyl or alkoxy. A dendron may have optionally substituted formula (XI) BR / 3 \ (XI) wherein BP represents a branching point for attachment to a core and Gi represents first generation branching groups. The dendron may be a first, second, third or higher generation dendron. Gi may be substituted with two or more second generation branching groups G2, and so on, as in optionally substituted formula (XIa): wherein u is 0 or 1 ; ν is 0 if u is 0 or may be 0 or 1 if u is 1 ; BP represents a branching point for attachment to a core and Gi, G2 and G3 represent first, second and third generation dendron branching groups. In one preferred embodiment, each of BP and Gi, G2 ... Gn is phenyl, and each phenyl BP, Gi, G2 ... Gn-i is a 3,5-linked phenyl. A preferred dendron is a substituted or unsubstituted dendron of formula (Xlb): wherein * represents an attachment point of the dendron to a core. BP and / or any group G may be substituted with one or more substituents, for example one or more Ci_2o alkyl or alkoxy groups. Phosphorescent light-emitting materials may be provided in a light-emitting layer with a host material. The host preferably has a triplet energy level that is no more than 0.1 eV lower than that of the phosphorescent light-emitting material, more preferably a triplet energy level that the same as or higher than that of the phosphorescent light-emitting material. Suitable host materials include small molecule, dendrimeric and polymeric host materials. Polymeric host materials include non-conjugated polymers with pendant charge-transporting groups, for example polyvinylcarbazole, and at least partially conjugated polymers, for example polymers comprising one or both of arylene repeat units and amine repeat units, for example arylene repeat units of formula (III), (IV) and (V) and amine repeat units of formula (VI). Phosphorescent light-emitting materials may make up about 0.05 mol % up to about 20 mol %, optionally about 0.1-10 mol % of a host / phosphorescent light-emitting material composition. The phosphorescent light-emitting material may be physically mixed with the host material or may be covalently bound thereto. In the case of a polymeric host, the phosphorescent light-emitting material may be provided in a side-chain, main chain or end-group of the polymer. Where the phosphorescent material is provided in a polymer side-chain, the phosphorescent material may be directly bound to the backbone of the polymer or spaced apart therefrom by a spacer group, for example a C1-20 alkyl spacer group in which one or more non-adjacent C atoms may be replaced by 0 or S. Hole injection layers A conductive hole injection layer, which may be formed from a conductive organic or inorganic material, may be provided between the anode and the light-emitting layer or layers of an OLED to improve hole injection from the anode into the layer or layers of semiconducting polymer. Examples of doped organic hole injection materials include optionally substituted, doped poly(ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDT), in particular PEDT doped with a charge-balancing polyacid such as polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) as disclosed in ΕΡ 0901176 and ΕΡ 0947123, polyacrylic acid or a fluorinated sulfonic acid, for example Nafion ®; polyaniline as disclosed in US 5723873 and US 5798170; and optionally substituted polythiophene or poly(thienothiophene). Examples of conductive inorganic materials include transition metal oxides such as VOx ΜοΟχ and RuOx as disclosed in Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics (1996), 29(11), 2750-2753. Where a hole-transporting layer is present, a hole-injection layer may be provided between the anode and the hole-transporting layer. Charge transporting and charge blocking layers A hole transporting layer may be provided between the anode and the light-emitting layer or layers, as described above. Likewise, an electron transporting layer may be provided between the cathode and the light-emitting layer or layers. Similarly, an electron blocking layer may be provided between the anode and the light-emitting layer and a hole blocking layer may be provided between the cathode and the light-emitting layer. Transporting and blocking layers may be used in combination. Depending on its HOMO and LUMO levels, a single layer may both transport one of holes and electrons and block the other of holes and electrons. If present, a hole transporting layer located between the anode and the light-emitting layers preferably has a HOMO level of less than or equal to 5.5 eV, more preferably around 4.8-5.5 eV as measured by cyclic voltammetry. The HOMO level of the hole transport layer may be selected so as to be within 0.2 eV, optionally within 0.1 eV, of an adjacent layer (such as a light-emitting layer) in order to provide a small barrier to hole transport between these layers. The hole-transporting layer may be a polymer comprising repeat units of formula (I) as described above. If present, an electron transporting layer located between the light-emitting layers and cathode preferably has a LUMO level of around 2.5-3.5 eV as measured by cyclic voltammetry. For example, a layer of a silicon monoxide or silicon dioxide or other thin dielectric layer having thickness in the range of 0.2-2nm may be provided between the light-emitting layer nearest the cathode and the cathode. HOMO and LUMO levels may be measured using cyclic voltammetry. An electron transporting layer may contain a polymer comprising a chain of optionally substituted arylene repeat units, such as a chain of fluorene repeat units. Cathode The cathode is selected from materials that have a workfunction allowing injection of electrons into the light-emitting layer. Other factors influence the selection of the cathode such as the possibility of adverse interactions between the cathode and the light-emitting material. The cathode may consist of a single material such as a layer of aluminium. Alternatively, it may comprise a plurality of conductive materials, for example a plurality of conductive metals such a bilayer of a low workfunction material and a high workfunction material such as calcium and aluminium as disclosed in WO 98/10621. The cathode may comprise a layer of elemental barium, for example as disclosed in WO 98/57381, Appl. Phys. Lett. 2002, 81(4), 634 and WO 02/84759. The cathode may comprise a thin (e.g. less than 5 nm) layer of metal compound between the organic semiconducting layers and one or more conductive cathode layers, in particular an oxide or fluoride of an alkali or alkali earth metal, to assist electron injection, for example lithium fluoride, for example as disclosed in WO 00/48258; barium fluoride, for example as disclosed in Appl. Phys. Lett. 2001, 79(5), 2001; and barium oxide. In order to provide efficient injection of electrons into the device, the cathode preferably has a workfunction of less than 3.5 eV, more preferably less than 3.2 eV, most preferably less than 3 eV. Work functions of metals can be found in, for example, Michaelson, J. Appl. Phys. 48(11), 4729, 1977. The cathode may be opaque or transparent. Transparent cathodes are particularly advantageous for active matrix devices because emission through a transparent anode in such devices is at least partially blocked by drive circuitry located underneath the emissive pixels. A transparent cathode comprises a layer of an electron injecting material that is sufficiently thin to be transparent. Typically, the lateral conductivity of this layer will be low as a result of its thinness. In this case, the layer of electron injecting material is used in combination with a thicker layer of transparent conducting material such as indium tin oxide. It will be appreciated that a transparent cathode device need not have a transparent anode (unless, of course, a fully transparent device is desired), and so the transparent anode used for bottom-emitting devices may be replaced or supplemented with a layer of reflective material such as a layer of aluminium. Examples of transparent cathode devices are disclosed in, for example, GB 2348316. Encapsulation Organic optoelectronic devices tend to be sensitive to moisture and oxygen. Accordingly, the substrate preferably has good barrier properties for prevention of ingress of moisture and oxygen into the device. The substrate is commonly glass, however alternative substrates may be used, in particular where flexibility of the device is desirable. For example, the substrate may comprise one or more plastic layers, for example a substrate of alternating plastic and dielectric barrier layers or a laminate of thin glass and plastic. The device may be encapsulated with an encapsulant (not shown) to prevent ingress of moisture and oxygen. Suitable encapsulants include a sheet of glass, films having suitable barrier properties such as silicon dioxide, silicon monoxide, silicon nitride or alternating stacks of polymer and dielectric or an airtight container. In the case of a transparent cathode device, a transparent encapsulating layer such as silicon monoxide or silicon dioxide may be deposited to micron levels of thickness, although in one preferred embodiment the thickness of such a layer is in the range of 20-300 nm. A getter material for absorption of any atmospheric moisture and / or oxygen that may permeate through the substrate or encapsulant may be disposed between the substrate and the encapsulant. Formulation processing Polymers comprising repeat units of formula (I) may be dispersed or dissolved in a solvent or mixture of two or more solvents to form a formulation that may be used to form a layer containing the compound by depositing the formulation and evaporating the solvent or solvents. The formulation may contain one or more further materials in addition to the polymer. All of the components of the formulation may be dissolved in the solvent or solvent mixture, in which case the formulation is a solution, or one or more components may be dispersed in the solvent or solvent mixture. Preferably, the formulation is a solution. Exemplary solvents for polymers comprising repeat units of formula (I) are mono- and poly-alkylated benzene, for example toluene and xylenes. Techniques for forming layers from a formulation include printing and coating techniques such spin-coating, dip-coating, roll printing, screen printing and inkjet printing. Multiple organic layers of an OLED may be formed by deposition of formulations containing the active materials for each layer. During OLED formation, a layer of the device may be crosslinked to prevent it from partially or completely dissolving in the solvent or solvents used to deposit an overlying layer. Where used as a hole-transporting layer, polymers comprising repeat units of formulae (I) and (II) may be crosslinked following deposition prior to deposition of an overlying layer. Suitable crosslinkable groups include groups comprising a reactive double bond such and a vinyl or acrylate group, or a benzocyclobutane group. Crosslinkable groups may be provided as substituents of a repeat unit of the polymer, and may be attached directly to a backbone of the polymer or spaced apart therefrom by a spacer chain, for example a C1-20 hydrocarbyl group. Coating methods such as spin-coating are particularly suitable for devices wherein patterning of the light-emitting layer is unnecessary - for example for lighting applications or simple monochrome segmented displays. Printing methods such as inkjet printing are particularly suitable for high information content displays, in particular full colour displays. A device may be inkjet printed by providing a patterned layer over the first electrode and defining wells for printing of one colour (in the case of a monochrome device) or multiple colours (in the case of a multicolour, in particular full colour device). Each well may define a pixel area, and each pixel may be subdivided into subpixels. The patterned layer may be a layer of photoresist that is patterned to define wells as described in, for example, ΕΡ 0880303. As an alternative to wells, the formulation may be printed into channels defined within a patterned layer. In particular, the photoresist may be patterned to form channels which, unlike wells, extend over a plurality of pixels and which may be closed or open at the channel ends.
