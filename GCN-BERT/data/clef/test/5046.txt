HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS BACKGROUND Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a class of enzymes, e.g., HDACl-11, that regulate gene expression via histone acetylation. HDAC inhibitors have been known to induce expression of p21 and/or p27, two proteins that induce cell growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in tumor cells. See Nimmanapalli et al., Blood 2003, 101, 3236-39; and Roy et al., Molecular Cancer Therapeutics 2007, 6, 2696-2707. They have thus attracted great attention as potent anticancer agents.

HDAC activity assays Compounds 1-21, 23, 5a- 5p, 6a, 7a, 10a, 14a-14i were subjected to several HDAC activity assays as described below. More specifically, the IC50 values of test compounds were determined by carrying out a fluorimetric histone deacetylase assay following the manufacturer's instructions. For a pan- HDAC assay, HeLa nuclear extracts were used as a source of histone deacetylase (Bio Vision Inc.). Histone deacetylase isomer inhibition assays were conducted using purified recombinant histone deacetylase proteins of the various isomers (BPS Bioscience Inc.). Reactions were performed in 0.1 mol/L KC1, 20 mmol/L HEPES/NaOH at pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mmol/L DTA, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, and 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Fluor de Lys substrate and test compounds of various concentrations (nmol/L to μιηοΙ/L) were used at 37°C in a buffer, containing 25 mmol/L Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 137 mmol/L NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L KC1, and 1 mmol/L MgCl2. Fluorescence was measured with excitation at a wavelength of 360 nm and emitted light of 460 nm (TECAN ULTRA 384) was detected. Negative (no enzyme, no inhibitor, a drug with no HDAC inhibition activity) and positive controls (a HeLa nuclear extract with no HDAC inhibitor and the known HDAC inhibitor SAHA) were included. Half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50S) were determined as the test compound concentration that resulted in 50% reduction of HDAC activity increase in control wells during the incubation. Reactions were carried out in triplicate for each test compound. Each point represented the mean + SD of replicates. Compounds 1-21, 23, 5a- 5p, 6a, 7a, 10a, 14a-14i each showed an IC50 value less than 6 μΜ in inhibiting HDAC in the KB cell line (oral carcinoma).

For the two dimensional assay, cancel cells in the logarithmic phase were cultured in complete medium in 96-well plates at 37°C with 5 % C02 for overnight incubation, and treated with various concentrations of test compounds for three generative times. Cells were then incubated with a serum free medium containing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mM for four hours. MTT was converted to formazan by metabolically viable cells. Formazan was then solublized in 50 % DMF solution containing 20 % SDS at 37°C overnight. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a spectramax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, UK). For the three dimensional assay, cells in the logarithmic phase were cultured in 50% Matrigel-containing complete medium in 96-well plates at 37°C with 5 % C02 for five days incubation, and treated with appropriate concentrations of test compounds for three generative times. Images of spheroids were taken under a microscope, and spheroid cell survival was determined by MTT assays. The results are shown in Tables 4-7 below. Table 4.

The cells (in the 2D culture) and the cellular spheres (in the 3D culture) were treated with test compounds for 72 hours, and then subjected to the MTT colorimetric assay. Each value represents the mean of three independent experiments. Cellular spheres formed in semi-solid and drug effect on cellular spheres were examined using phase-contrast light microscopy. Compound 5b had a similar anti-proliferative activity in both the two and three dimension cell culture system in human prostate carcinoma cells. Table 6.

More specifically, cellular spheres formed in semi-solid and drug effect on cellular spheres were examined using phase-contrast light microscopy. 3D structures of cells were analyzed using 4x magnification, lOx magnification, and 20x magnification. Compound 7 disrupted the spheroid structure of PC3 tumors in a concentration-dependent manner. The cytotoxic effect of compound 7 was potent in both a 3D spheroid culture and a 2D culture. SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis Compounds 7, 5b, and 14a were subjected to the SDS-PAGE and the western blot analysis following the procedures described below. More specifically, cells in the logarithmic phase were initially seeded at a density of lxl06 in 100 mm dishes. After treatment with test compounds at various concentrations (i.e., 0.5x, lx, 2x, and 4x IC50; IC50 indicia of compound in vitro potency) for the indicated times (i.e., 24 and 48 hours), adherent cells were collected for protein extract preparation. Briefly, cells were lysed with the cell lysis reagent CelLytic™ M (Sigma- Aldrich) containing 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitors for whole-cell lysate preparation. Equal amounts of lysate (on a protein basis) were then differentiated using the SDS-PAGE, blotted on PVDF membranes, conjugated with various specific primary antibodies, and then probed with appropriate secondary antibodies. The immunoreactive bands were detected using the ECL method and visualized on Kodak Bio-MAX MR film. Proteins from cells were extracted and subjected to the western blotting analysis, β- Actin was used as an internal control. The deacetylase enzyme assay was based on a homogeneous fluorescence release assay. Purified recombinant HDAC enzymes were incubated with substrates and test compounds at various concentrations (i.e., 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, and 1000 nM for Compounds 7 and 5b; 0.5x, lx, 2x, and 4x IC50 for Compound 14a) for 24 hours. After fluorophore from the deacetylated substrates, fluorescent signal was detected. Compound 7 inhibited HDACl-10 activities in PC3 cells in a concentration- dependent manner for 48 hours. In a 24-hour study, Compound 5b induced inhibition of HDAC 1 and HDAC2 at 50 nM or lower and induced inhibition of HDAC6 at about 100 nM. Compounds 7, 5b, and 14a all induced histone and ot-tubulin acetylation in PC3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, Compound 5b also induced histone and ot- tubulin acetylation in human B JAB B cell lymphoma and MDA-MD-231 breast carcinoma; and Compound 14a also induced histone and ot-tubulin acetylation in human DU145 cells. Cell cycle analysis Compounds 7, 5b, and 14a were subjected to cell cycle analysis following the procedure described below. More specifically, cells in the logarithmic phase were initially seeded at a density of Ixl06 in l00 mm dishes. After treatment with various concentrations of test compounds for the indicated times, cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were then treated with 50 μg/mL RNase and stained with 50 μg/mL propidium iodide at room temperature for 20 minutes. The DNA content was determined by BD FACS Calibur flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences). For each analysis, 10,000 cells were counted, and the percentage of cells in each phase was calculated using ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Inc.). Human androgen-independent PC3 prostate cancer cells were treated with Compounds 7, 5b, and 14a at various doses (i.e., 0.5x, lx, 2x, 4x, and 8x IC50) for different durations (i.e., 24 and 48 hours for Compounds 7 and 5b; 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours for Compound 14a). Compounds 7, 5b, and 14a all induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in androgen- independent PC3 prostate cancer cells. Compound 5b also induced p21 up-regulation. Cell proliferation in C6 glioma in vitro The rat C6 glioma cell line was treated with Compound 7 and analyzed following the procedure described below. C6 glioma cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cultured cells were treated with either vehicle or Compound 7 for 24, 48, or 72 hours and further measured by the MTT assay (Liu et al., Toxicol. Res. , 2015). Briefly, cells were incubated with 0.25 mg/mL MTT (Sigma) at 37°C for 1 hr and the MTT fomazan was measured spectrophotometrically ^Quant, Bio-Tek) at 595 nm after dissolution of the crystals in DMSO. For cell cycle analysis, C6 glioma cell line was pre-treadted with Compound 7 at various concentrations for the indicated times (see "Cell cycle analysis", supra). After the treatment, cells were further trypsinized, washed with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were then treated with RNase and stained with 50 mg/mL propidium iodide at room temperature for 20 minutes. The staining fluorescence intensity indicating the DNA content was determined by a BD FACS Calibur flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences). For each analysis, 10,000 cells were counted, and the percentage of cells in each phase (i.e., SubGl , G0-G1, S, or G2-M) was calculated. Unexpectedly, Compound 7 inhibited the cell proliferation in a concentration- dependent manner and showed about 50% inhibition of cell proliferation at 30 uM. By contrast, SAHA, a HDAC6 inhibitor, did not exert any inhibition at the same concentration. Cell death in C6 glioma in vitro The rat C6 glioma cell line was treated with Compound 7 and analyzed following the procedure described below. Cell death was analyzed by a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. The culture medium was centrifuged after the experiment and the activity of LDH released into culture media was detected with a LDH cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche). The percentage of cytotoxicity was determined by the equation: [(Experimental group - Control group) / (Triton- 100-treated group (100% maximal death) - Control group)] xl00%. The test compound was found to induce the cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. It unexpectedly showed about 100% induction of cell death at 30 uM after 3 days, compared with about 70% induction by SAHA. Cell viability in human glioblastoma (U87MG or GBM8401) in vitro U87MG human glioblastoma cell line was treated with Compound 7 and analyzed following the procedure described below. Cell viability was assessed by an MTT assay. Briefly, cells were incubated with 0.25 mg/mL MTT (Sigma) at 37°C for 1 hour and the MTT fomazan were measured spectrophotometrically ^Quant, Bio-Tek) at 595 nm after dissolution of the crystals in DMSO. Compound 7 reduced viability of human glioblastoma (U87MG or GBM8401) cells in a concentration-dependent manner and showed about 70% reduction of the cell viability at 30 uM. In vivo HDAC inhibitory assay Compound 7 was subjected to an in vivo HDAC inhibitory assay in mice following the procedure described below. More specifically, the antitumor effect of Compound 7 was examined in the human PC3 xenografted mice. Subcutaneous inoculation of 5 x 106 PC3 cells in specific pathogen- free male athymic mice (strain BALB/cAnN.Cg-Foxnlnu/CrlNarl) from the National Laboratory Animal Center, Taiwan, was applied. The mice were subsequently fed under specific pathogen- free conditions and provided with sterile water and food. When the tumor volume reached 150 to 200 mm3, mice were assigned to groups randomly and treated with a vehicle control and 25 mg/kg Compound 7 for 4, 8, and 24 hours (n = 3) by oral administration, and then sacrificed at the time indicated. Tumor samples were obtained and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage in -80°C. Tumor proteins were extracted and subjected to the Western blotting analysis. β-Actin was used as an internal control. Compoud 7 was effective at 25 mg/kg in inhibiting HDACs by monitoring p21 , p27, histone, and ot-tubulin acetylation in the PC3 xenograft model. In vivo antitumor activity assay Compounds 7 and 5b were tested in an in vivo antitumor activity assay following the procedure described below. The antitumor effect of the two test compounds were examined in mice xenografted with human PC3 prostate cancer cells or HCT116 colorectal cells. Five million PC3 cells were subcutaneously inoculated into specific pathogen-free male athymic mice (strain BALB/cAnN.Cg-Foxnlnu/CrlNarl) from the National Laboratory Animal Center, Taiwan. Mice were subsequently fed under specific pathogen-free conditions and provided with sterile water and food. When the tumor volume reached 150 to 200 mm3, mice were assigned to groups randomly and treated with vehicle control or Compound 7 or 5b at 25/50/100 mg/kg. The compound was administered once a day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks (n = 6) by oral administration. Tumor volume and body weight change were measured twice a week. At the end of the experiments (day 25 after first dosing), animals were euthanized in a CC>2-containing chamber, and the tumors were collected and fixed in formaldehyde. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay (TUNEL) was conducted for apoptosis detection. Tumor tissue sections were analyzed using a FITC In Situ Cell death detection kit (Roche) and fluorescence microscopy. Tissue treated with DNase was used as the positive control. Green fluorescence labeled nucleus indicates the induction of DNA fragmentation. Compounds 7 inhibited human PC3 xenograft growth by about 50% at both 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg at day 25 after the first dosing without causing much body weight change. Compounds 7 also inhibited human colorectal HCT116 xenograft growth by about 50-60% at 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg at day 22 after the first dosing, again without causing much body weight change. Compounds 5b inhibited human PC 3 xenograft growth by about 70% at 50 mg/kg at day 29 after the first dosing. Unexpectedly, Compounds 5b completely inhibited human PC3 xenograft growth at 100 mg/kg and achieved tumor regression from day 8 to day 29 after the first dosing. In vivo antitumor activity of Compound 7 against human glioblastoma xenograft tumor The antitumor effect of Compound 7 was examined in human glioblastoma (U87- MG-LucNeo cells) on the xenografted mouse model. A HDAC6 inhibitor, i.e., SAHA, and clinically first-line and anti-glioblastoma drug temozolomide (TMZ) were used for comparison. Male athymic nude mice at 5-6 weeks old were obtained from BioLasco (Taiwan) and maintained in a specific-pathogen-free facility. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee of Taipei Medical University. Each nude mouse was anesthetized with an i.p. injection of xylazine (Sigma) and zolazepam (Zoletil 50, Virbac), and then secured in a stereotaxic frame. Luciferase expressing U87 cells (106 cells in PBS) was intracranially implanted into the right striatum as previously described (Liu et al., Toxicol. Res. , 2015). One week after implantation, Nude mice were treated with TMZ (50 mg/kg. p.o.), SAHA (150 mg/kg, p.o.) or Compound 7 (50-100 mg/kg, p.o.) and their survival rates were analyszed in 4 groups including a vehicle group. Survival analyses showed that Compound 7 unexpectedly extended survival longer than TMZ. Orthotopic tumor size measurement Another parallel set of xenografted nude mice treated with drug or vehicle treatment as described above were used in this experiment. A bioluminescence IVIS 2000 imaging system was used to measure tumor size in vivo as previously described (Liu et al., Toxicol. Res. , 2015). Imaging analysis revealed that a low dose of Compound 7 (25 mg/kg) decreased the tumor size more than a higher dose of SAHA (150 mg/kg) or the same dose of TMZ (25 mg/kg).
