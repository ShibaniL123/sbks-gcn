COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR IMPROVING HUMAN HEALTH AND NUTRITION RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority to and benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/992,055 filed on May 12, 2014 the contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to compositions containing a mixture of pre-, pro- and post- biotic materials and their use in promoting human health and nutrition. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Pre-, Pro-, and post-biotics are relatively new terms used to describe a range of materials that have demonstrated benefits in human health. Typically, the term prebiotic refers to a material that stimulates the growth and/or activity of bacteria in the digestive system resulting in beneficial health effects. Prebiotics may be selectively fermented or non-fermented ingredients that allow specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity of the gastrointestinal microflora, which confer health benefits upon the host. Probiotics generally refer to microorganisms that contribute to intestinal microbial balance which in turn play a role in maintaining health. Many species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) such as, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are generally considered as Probiotics, but some species of Bacillus, and some yeasts have also been found as suitable candidates. Post-biotics refer to non-viable bacterial products or metabolic by products from probiotic organisms that have biologic activity in the host. [0004] The use of Probiotics to improve human and/or animal health is well documented in the literature. In addition, prebiotics and postbiotics offer potential alternatives or adjunctive therapies to the use of live microorganisms and their metabolites. The mechanisms by which these materials beneficially affect human/animal health are typically divided into one of two general categories. The first, modulation of the immune response, and second, antagonism of pathogens either by the production of antimicrobial compounds or through competition for mucosal binding sites. This leads to a suppression of pathogen growth or epithelial binding and hence reduces invasion by pathogenic bacteria and improves the bioavailability and absorption of nutrients, and acts as nutritional intervention in human health. [0005] There is an increasing appreciation of the impact of pre-, pro-, and postbiotics on the modulation of the immune response, more specifically their role in modulating the expression of cytokines that regulate inflammatory responses which can be measured at a local and systemic level. The ingestion of probiotic bacteria, for example, can potentially stabilize the immunologic barrier in the gut mucosa by reducing the generation of local pro-inflammatory cytokines. Alteration of the properties of the indigenous microflora by probiotic therapy has been shown to reverse some immunologic disturbances in acute syndromes such as dysbiosis, one of the most common disorders of the digestive system, and mitigate some chronic conditions characteristic of Crohn's disease, food allergy, and atopic eczema. Several probiotic species or their postbiotic products induce protective cytokines, including IL-10 and TGF-beta, and suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, in the mucosa of healthy patients, patients with inflammatory bowel disease and mouse models. Although there is suggestive evidence for each of these claims, the molecular details behind these mechanisms remains almost entirely undetermined. [0006] Primary clinical interest in the application of probiotics has been in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases including bacterial and viral associated diarrhea. The use of probiotics for control of chronic inflammatory diseases such as pouchitis and ulcerative colitis has also received considerable attention. Moreover, the consumption of pre-, pro- and postbiotics has been linked to the improvement of a wide variety of health conditions, including high cholesterol, rheumatoid arthritis and lactose intolerance. [0007] Despite the growing literature on the benefits of various "biotic" therapies, the beneficial effects of combined pre-, pro-, and postbiotic therapies is less well documented. There remains need for therapeutic compositions combining these therapies to provide a range of health benefits. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0008] In one aspect the invention provides compositions containing a mixture of a prebiotic, a probiotic comprising a mixture of Lactobacillus and 'or Bifidobacterium microorganisms produced by solid substrate and submerged liquid fermentation and a postbiotic derived from the liquid fermentation medium of the Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium microorganism, hereinafter referred to as Microbiotic Composites™.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [00026] The invention provides a composition consisting of a mixture of specific microbiotic composites™ (pre-, pro- and postbiotics) that are useful in promoting overall human health, when given as orally as a nutritional intervention. For example, the compositions of the invention are useful in promoting digestive heath, weight management and metabolism (i.e., nutritional heath) Human health is promoted as indicated by biochemical markers including for example, blood sugar levels, lipid chemistry, liver function, full blood count, thyroid function, markers of inflammation (ESR and C-reactive protein), and stool classifications. In addition the compositions of the invention are further useful, when applied topically in promoting skin heath. [00027] The term " prebiotic" as used herein includes compounds that stimulate the growth and or activity of bacteria. [00028] The term "probiotic bacteria" or "probiotics" or "microbiotic composites™" as used herein, refers to microorganisms which when administered for nutritional intervention in adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the consumer. Heath benefit can be measured by any method known in the art, for example, as indicated by biochemical markers including for example, blood sugar levels, lipid chemistry, liver function, full blood count, thyroid function, markers of inflammation (ESR and C- reactive protein), and stool classifications. [00029] The probiotics according to the invention may be viable or non-viable. In case the probiotics are non- viable, they have to be substantially structurally intact, meaning that these non-viable microorganisms are still sufficiently intact to avoid or delay disintegration in the distal intestinal tract thereby enabling the interaction of (conserved structures of) the non-viable micro-organisms with the immune system, particularly the mucosal immune system. The non-viable probiotics are metabolically-active. By "metabolically-actrve" is meant that they exhibit at least some residual enzyme activity characteristic to that type of probiotic [00030] By the term "postbiotic" as used herein refer to the non-viable bacterial products or metabolic by products from the probiotic organism. [00031] By the term "non-viable" as used herein is meant a population of bacteria that is not capable of replicating under any known conditions. However, it is to be understood that due to normal biological variations in a population, a small percentage of the population (i.e. 5% or less) may still be viable and thus capable of replication under suitable growing conditions in a population which is otherwise defined as non-viable. [00032] By the term "viable bacteria" as used herein is meant a. population of bacteria that is capable of replicating under s uitable conditions under which replication is possible. A pop ulation of bacteria that does not fulfill the definition of "non-viable" (as given above) is considered to be 'Viable". [00033] By the term "bioactive component" as used herein is meant a component which has a physiological effect upon the body when consumed in adequate amounts. [00034] Unless stated otherwise, all percentages mentioned in this document are by weight based on the total weight of the composition. [00035] Prebiotics used in the product according to the present invention may be any conventional prebiotic. The prebiotic is food grade. It is preferred that the prebiotic is inulin, fructo- oligosaccharides, or gluco-oligosaccharides. [00036] The probiotic bacteria used in the product according to the present invention may be any conventional probiotic bacteria. The probiotic bacteria is GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe).

[00095] Key Learning [00096] There was total of 27 participants in this group. 12 subjects showed both a weight reduction, as well as a reduction in waist measurement. The remainder showed weight loss only. [00097] Grouping both together it takes into account conversion of peripheral fat to muscle in this contexts [00098] Two participants remained neutral in both weight as well as waist measurement. One participant gained weight. [00099] B) Results in Blood Marker Levels: [000100] Significant reductions were observed among subjects in blood sugar (FBS), cholesterol and LDL (Figure 4). [000101] C) Liver Function Results: [000102] Significant reductions were also observed in the liver enzymes ALT and GGT which are correlated with reduced liver stress (Figures 5 and 6). [000103] Hepatic Enzyme Markers ALT / GGT: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and γ- glutamyltransferase (GGT) are strongly associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. Research has associated the risk of type 2 diabetes to be significantly higher with increasing levels of ALT and GGT, particularly in men. [000104] D) Digestive Health Results: [000105] Significant improvements were observed in the bowel habits of 100% of test subjects. [000106] Improvements were seen in constipation or loose bowels, and in stool consistency; as measured by subjects using an industry standard tool, the Bristol Stool Chart (BSC). Bristol stool chart levels of 1 or 2 are typically representative of dysbiosis in most Western countries, whereas looser stools in values of 5-7 are quite common in most developing countries. [000107] The overall results show a normalization of bowel habits with a predominant shift to level 3-4 noted with improved stool consistency. [000108] Figure 7: PRE-CLINICAL: [000109] 3 - people reported constipation and had separate hard lumps to sausage shaped but lumpy [000110] 23 - people were in a normal range with sausage, with surface cracks to sausage, smooth and soft [000111] 4 - people reported soft, fluffy, or watery consistency [000112] Figure 8: POST-CLINICAL: [000113] 100% of people had improved bowel function [000114] 2- people had slight changes in consistency [000115] 1- person improved their stool consistency from separate hard lumps to an ideal stool consistency [000116] 23- people were in a normal range but improved their stool consistency [000117] 4- people improved from soft, fluffy, or watery to an ideal stool consistency [000118] EXAMPLE 4: FACIAL AND BODY SKIN CARE STUDY. [000119] EFFECTS ON VARIOUS SKIN TYPES - A CASE CONTROL STUDY. [000120] Overview [000121] A topical probiotic formulation comprising the Microbiotic Composite™ of Example 2E was trialed in a variety of skin conditions including acne, dermatitis, eczema as well as sensitive skin types that included inflammation and rosacea. The beneficial effects documented included improvements in skin pigmentation, moisture, and texture, as well as pigmentation in various subgroups of the study. For example, in the eczema subgroup there was a significant improvement in pigmentation, moisture and texture. This result was also noted in the acne and dermatitis subgroups. The formulation demonstrated clinical effects with the majority of responses within the first five days of using the products in the study (60%). This was also reflected in an overall trend demonstrating that 75% of patients reported some improvements. [000122] Design [000123] The study was designed as a case-control study looking for improvement in skin conditions such as acne, dermatitis, eczema, and generalized information on sensitive skin and rosacea. [000124] Protocol and Materials; [000125] A total of 25 subjects were recruited for the study from a skin care clinic based in Sydney, Australia. The participants in the study were regular clientele who all exhibited some form of skin condition that had been non-amendable to traditional prior treatments using their current skin care regime. [000126] All participants were reviewed by a medical practitioner prior to commencement of the study. [000127] Subjects were advised to use two skin care products, a Deep Moisturizer Cream and a Topical Gel, for both facial and body application. Both products were to be used as subjects would normally apply such products to problematic skin areas, but were instructed to use the products at least once daily for four weeks. [000128] The Deep Moisturizer Cream was composed of the following materials: [000129] 65% Water [000130] 2% Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride [000131] 2% Propanediol [000132] 2% Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate [000133] 3% Microbial Composite™ (Example 2E Composition) [000134] 2% Saccharide Isomerate [000135] 2% Stearic Acid [000136] 2% Potassium Cetyl Phosphate [000137] (The following ingredients totaled to 20% of the formula by weight and were added in amounts of less than 1% each) [000138] Disodium EDTA, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hibiscus Abelmoschus Seed Extract, Butylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Glycerin, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Extract, Gardenia Tahitensis Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Abelmoschus Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus Clove Flower Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Flower/Leaf Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Polianthes Tuberosa Extract, Hedychium Spicatum Extract, Plumeria Ruba Flower Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene Glycol [000139] The Topical Gel was composed of the following materials: [000140] 65% Water [000141] 5% Glycerin [000142] 3% Microbial Composite™ (Example 2E Composition) [000143] 3%Polysorbate 20 [000144] (The following ingredients totaled to 24% and were added in amounts of less than 1 percent each) [000145] Disodium EDTA, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Extract, Gardenia Tahitensis Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Abelmoschus Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Flower/Leaf Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Polianthes Tuberosa Extract, Hedychium Spicatum Extract, Plumeria Ruba Flower Extract, Sodium Hydroxide [000146] The exclusion criteria for the study were based on previous exposure to systemic vitamin A therapies. In addition, participants were asked to stop using any other topical therapies on their faces for the month of the study. Clients were advised to refrain from using ablative technologies (including microdermabrasion and skin needling), light based therapies (including IPL and laser) or chemical peels (such as lactic acid, TCA or Jessner's) for the duration of the study. [000147] Data was collected via means of a questionnaire, photographs at baseline and at the completion of the study. Over the duration of the test, participants were evaluated weekly via telephone interviews. [000148] Data included subjective questionnaire parameters around skin improvement. Objective parameters included an assessment of skin pigmentation, fine line and heavy line reduction, overall skin moisturizing, as well as skin texture. Adverse events were monitored either via direct observation, or subjective assessment of erythema, or pain on using the product based on participant responses. A medical practitioner reviewed all adverse events. [000149] Results: [000150] 15 participants completed the full study requirements. [000151] In the acne subgroup, beneficial effects were noted on skin pigmentation, skin moisture as well as skin texture (N=6). In fact, N=5 persons reported improvement in skin moisture and N=4 on skin texture on completion of the study. Further, an overwhelming N=5 reported benefits in pigmentation. As is noted in all subgroups (discussed below), there were subtle improvements in fine lines and heavy lines. However, most participants reported no or minimal changes. In the dermatitis subgroup (N=3), similar results were noted. There is a significant improvement in skin moisture (N=3) and modest improvement in skin texture and skin pigmentation (N=2) on using the product. In the eczema subgroup (N=6), there was a significant improvement in pigmentation, moisture and texture when using the product (N=5, 5 and 6 respectively). Results on sensitive skin (including inflammation and rosacea) were not significant, although there was an overall trend favoring noted in skin moisture, skin texture and pigmentation. The results are not as apparent as those noted in other skin conditions. The results described are noted in the figure below. [000152] The results on skin pigmentation, skin moisture and skin texture can be best appreciated when incorporating all the data together. As is noted in figure 2 below, a total of 12 participants reported an improvement in skin pigmentation as compared to 3 who showed no change. A similar result was also noted on skin moisture. The results were better when looking at skin texture with a total of 13 participants showing improvement, with two showing no change. The results on fine and heavy lines were not significant. [000153] A further interesting aspect noted in the study was the time to observe a clinical response. Most topical agents can vary from several days to several months. In fact, rapid responses are typically only noted for corticosteroid preparations. [000154] However, in this particular study, the time to clinical response was quite fast. For example, within the first 72 hours, 20% of the participants reported a time to clinical response. A further 40% showed improvement in skin quality by day five of the study. A further 10% had some changes by day seven. By two weeks, a further 30% had shown a physiological change to their skin. Overall, 100% of all participants who completed the study had a clinical response within two weeks. This result is summarized in the pie chart below. [000155] The most striking feature noted on using this topical agent is the improvement on specific skin conditions. For example, figure 14 shows the effect of the topical agent on a patient who had eczema on her leg. The panel on the left which shows the posterior view of the leg, shows significant resolution off the erythema associated with eczema based on the before (top) and after (bottom) views. A similar effect was noted on the lateral aspect of the leg shown on the right of the same image. [000156] These effects were not only noted on eczema. For example, figure 15shows photographic images of a patient who had a combination of acne and dermatitis on her face. The image shown on the left shows significant dermatitis on the malar aspect the face as well as the tear troughs prior to treatment (left), and resolution thereof (right). In addition, the cystic acne noted on the chin significantly improved at the completion of the study, and is noted on the figure on the right. [000157] A similar effect was noted on cystic acne. Figure 16 shows images of acne before (left) and after (right) application of the topical probiotic agent. As is noted in the figure, significant changes are noted when viewing the skin from a lateral aspect (panel A above) as well as oblique aspects (panel B below). [000158] Note: The figures shown were chosen to be representative of improvements in skin condition noted by most of the participants of the study. [000159] Conclusion [000160] Overall, panelists benefited from using the product for a variety of skin conditions including acne, dermatitis, eczema, as well as sensitive skin. Most participants reported an improvement in pigmentation, skin moisture, as well as skin texture. Results on fine and heavy lines were not significant. It is, however, important to note that this trial preparation did not include various topical excipients, such as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, alphahydroxy acids, idebenone. These agents have been shown to have beneficial effects on skin growths and often termed cosmeceuticals. It is contemplated that future iterations of this technology will contain such excipients with a view of improving overall physiological benefits.
