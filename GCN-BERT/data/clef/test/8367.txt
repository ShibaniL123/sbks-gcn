The present invention relates to new indolizine compounds, to a process for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The compounds of the present invention are new and have very valuable pharmacological characteristics in the field of apoptosis and cancerology. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a physiological process that is crucial for embryonic development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Apoptotic-type cell death involves morphological changes such as condensation of the nucleus, DNA fragmentation and also biochemical phenomena such as the activation of caspases which cause damage to key structural components of the cell, so inducing its disassembly and death. Regulation of the process of apoptosis is complex and involves the activation or repression of several intracellular signalling pathways (Cory S. et al., Nature Review Cancer, 2002, 2, 647-656). Deregulation of apoptosis is involved in certain pathologies. Increased apoptosis is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and ischaemia. Conversely, deficits in the implementation of apoptosis play a significant role in the development of cancers and their chemoresistance, in auto-immune diseases, inflammatory diseases and viral infections. Accordingly, absence of apoptosis is one of the phenotypic signatures of cancer (Hanahan D. et al., Cell 2000, 100, 57-70). The anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family are associated with numerous pathologies. The involvement of proteins of the Bcl-2 family is described in numerous types of cancer, such as colon cancer, breast cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, chronic lymphoid leukaemia, follicular lymphoma, myeloma, prostate cancer, etc. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family is involved in tumorigenesis, in resistance to chemotherapy and in the clinical prognosis of patients affected by cancer. There is, therefore, a therapeutic need for compounds that inhibit the anti-apoptotic activity of the proteins of the Bcl-2 family. In addition to being new, the compounds of the present invention have pro-apoptotic properties making it possible to use them in pathologies involving a defect in apoptosis, such as, for example, in the treatment of cancer and of immune and auto-immune diseases.

Sixteen hours after treatment, the tumour masses are recovered and lysed, and the caspase 3 activity is measured in the tumour lysates. This enzymatic measurement is carried out by assaying the appearance of a fluorigenic cleavage product (DEVDase activity, Promega). It is expressed in the form of an activation factor corresponding to the ratio between the two caspase activities:the activity for the treated mice divided by the activity for the control mice. The results obtained are presented in Table 2 and show that the compounds of the invention are capable of inducing apoptosis in RS4;11 tumour cells in vivo.

After treatment, the tumour masses are recovered and lysed, and the cleaved (activated) form of caspase 3 is quantified in the tumour lysates. The quantification is carried out using the “Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) ELISA platform” test, which specifically assays the cleaved form of caspase 3. It is expressed in the form of an activation factor corresponding to the ratio between the quantity of cleaved caspase 3 in the treated mice divided by the quantity of cleaved caspase 3 in the control mice. The results obtained are presented in Table 3 and show that the compounds of the invention are capable of inducing apoptosis in RS4;11 tumour cells in vivo.

The tumour mass is measured twice weekly from the start of treatment. The compounds of the invention have anti-tumour activities, by the oral route, in the RS4;11 leukaemia model (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) with ΔT/C (qualification parameter of the activity of a product, which is defined as the ratio tumour volume of the treated group/tumour volume of the untreated control group) ranging from −15 to −56% related to tumour regression. The results obtained therefore show that the compounds of the invention are capable of inducing significant tumour regression during the treatment period.
