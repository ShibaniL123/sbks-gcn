Field of the invention The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid. Background of the invention A polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether acetic acid such as a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid is a polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether compound having an end substituted with a carboxylic acid, and it is known as a surfactant that may be used for cosmetics, an emulsifying agent, a solubilizing agent, a dispersant, a gelling agent, a cleansing base, or the like. Properties of a polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether acetic acid can be adjusted by changing pH. As a polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether acetic acid has excellent resistance to hard water and an aqueous solution thereof is stable against various polyvalent metal ions such as calcium or aluminum and has a mild action on the skin, it is expected to be applied for various uses. As a method for manufacturing a polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether acetic acid such as a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid, a method of an organic chemical carboxymethylation of a terminal hydroxyl group of a polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether by reacting monochloroacetic acid to a polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide is generally used [hereinbelow, referred to as "carboxymethylation"].

In JP-A 4-221339, a method for producing a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid by dehydrogenating and oxidizing a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether using a noble metal catalyst in the absence of a base is disclosed [hereinbelow, referred to as "non-neutralization oxidation"]. US-A 5495045 discloses production of an alkoxyalkyl carboxylic acid from an alkoxyalkanol in the presence of a cerium salt. JP-A 61-293948 discloses production of a carboxylic acid from a primary alcohol in the presence of a platinum catalyst. JP-B 2903187 discloses production of a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid by oxygen-oxidization of R-O-(CH2CH2O)n-H in the presence of a catalyst containing platinum or palladium and bismuth or lead.

Summary of the invention The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid by feeding oxygen to a liquid phase containing a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether having a hydrocarbon group at the end (hereinbelow, it may be referred to as a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether) and water, and dehydrogenating and oxidizing the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether in the presence of a platinum catalyst, in which the mass ratio between the total mass of the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid and the mass of water in the liquid phase (i.e., total mass of polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid/mass of water) is 60/40 to 95/5. Detailed description of the invention The carboxymethylation in a conventional art has problems below: 1) monochloroacetic acid is unstable in water, and thus undergoes decomposition during the reaction, and2) a large amount of inorganic salts are generated as side products in the reaction product, so that the inorganic salts need to be removed by an operation such as washing or the like. The alkali neutralization oxidation of JP-A 62-198641 also has problems, for example, including: 1) a carboxylic acid salt needs to be subjected to an acid decomposition to obtain a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid as a free acid and a large amount of inorganic salts derived from a base are generated as side products, and2) a step of concentrating the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid is needed. In the non-neutralization oxidation which does not use a base, catalytic activity is lowered in accordance with the progress of the reaction. In particular, it was found out by the inventors of the present invention that, when a polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether acetic acid having an average added mole number of the alkyleneoxy group of 6 mole or less is manufactured from the starting material of a polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether that has been manufactured by adding an alkylene oxide to an alcohol, the reaction rate (also referred to as conversion rate) decreases (cannot be improved any further). Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid which does not produce inorganic salts as side products and does not decrease in the catalytic activity according to the progress of the reaction, but has a high productivity. Provided by the invention is a method for manufacturing a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid which does not produce inorganic salts as side products or require a complicated operation for concentration, but has high productivity. The inventors of the present invention found that, by having the mass ratio between the total mass of the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid and the mass of water in the liquid phase within a pre-determined range, a significant increase in viscosity in accordance with the reaction can be suppressed and side production of an aldehyde compound can be suppressed so that a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid as an intended product can be manufactured with high production efficiency, and thus completed the invention accordingly. In the present invention, the term "liquid phase" means a liquid phase in every step including the time of starting the reaction. In the manufacturing method of the present invention, a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid can be obtained at a high effective concentration only by having a process of filtering the catalyst after completion of the reaction without requiring a removing operation of inorganic salts or a complicated operation for concentration. In the manufacturing method of the present invention, a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid can be obtained efficiently as there is no decrease in catalytic activity in accordance with the progress of the reaction. When the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid obtained by the present invention is used for a body cleansing agent composition, for example, an excellent effect in terms of sense of use, foam generation, and a mild skin irritation property, or the like is obtained.

The platinum catalyst used for the manufacturing method of the present invention is a catalyst containing platinum (Pt) as an active species from the viewpoint of catalytic activity. From the viewpoint of improving durability of the catalyst, a platinum catalyst supported on a support is preferable. From the viewpoint of improving durability of the catalyst and improving handleability of the catalyst, the support is preferably an inorganic support. Examples thereof include activated carbon, alumina, silica gel, activated clay, and diatomaceous earth. Among them, activated carbon is preferable. With regard to the platinum catalyst supported on a support, the amount of supported platinum is preferably 0.1 to 15% by mass, and more preferably 1.0 to 10% by mass in the solid matter of the catalyst from the viewpoint of suppressing the viscosity increase of the liquid phase during the reaction and improving the productivity of the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid. From the viewpoint of suppressing the production of an aldehyde and improving the productivity of the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid, the platinum catalyst preferably contains a co-catalyst component. Examples of the co-catalyst component include such as bismuth (Bi), lead (Pb), tin (Sn), gold (Au), ruthenium (Ru), and palladium (Pd). From the viewpoint of suppressing the production of an aldehyde and further improving the productivity, it is preferable to contain bismuth or lead. It is more preferable to contain bismuth. When the co-catalyst component is contained, the amount of supported co-catalyst component in the platinum catalyst supported on a support is, from the viewpoint of suppressing the production of an aldehyde and improving the productivity, preferably 0.01 to 10% by mass, and more preferably 0.5 to 3.5% by mass in the solid matter of the catalyst. The content ratio of the platinum to the co-catalyst component is, from the viewpoint of suppressing the production of an aldehyde and improving the productivity, preferably 0.05 to 1.0, and more preferably 0.1 to 0.6 in terms of co-catalyst component/platinum (in atomic ratio). The platinum catalyst used for the manufacturing method of the present invention is manufactured by a known method in the field. For example, a method of impregnating a support component such as an activated carbon in an aqueous solution containing a pre-determined amount of platinum (and, if necessary, a co-catalyst component such as bismuth) and adsorbing the platinum (and the co-catalyst component) on the support component can be applied. After the adsorption, a reduction treatment is performed using a reducing agent such as formalin, sodium borohydride, or hydrogen. The platinum catalyst is obtained by filtration and washing after reduction, and it can be used for the reaction even when it contains water or after being dried. From the viewpoint of improving the productivity of a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid, the platinum catalyst is preferably used such that the amount of platinum in the catalyst is 0.001 to 2.0 parts by mass, more preferably 0.01 to 1.5 parts by mass, and even more preferably 0.02 to 1.3 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether. The dehydrogenating and oxidizing reaction of a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether is performed by feeding, in the presence of the platinum catalyst, oxygen to a liquid phase containing a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and water. The dehydrogenating and oxidizing reaction can be performed in a batch mode. For example, moreover, a circulating fixed bed type reaction apparatus with a fixed bed catalyst can be used, which has a structure as shown in FIG. 1 of JP-A 2008-94800. At the time of the reaction, it is preferable not to add a base from the viewpoint of suppressing the generation of inorganic salts as side products. Further, from the viewpoint of improving the productivity and suppressing the production of an aldehyde, the dehydrogenating and oxidizing reaction of a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether is preferably carried out under a condition of a pH of 7 or less, more preferably a pH of 1 to 7, even more preferably a pH of 2 to 7. The pH of the liquid phase at the time of starting the reaction is about 7, and as the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid is manufactured in accordance with the progress of the reaction, the liquid phase gradually becomes acidic and the reaction is progressed in the state of a pH of 7 or less. When no base is used at the time of the reaction for the manufacturing method of the present invention, generation of inorganic salts as side products, which is a problem in carboxymethylation or alkali neutralization oxidation corresponding to a technique of the related art, does not occur. In the manufacturing method of the present invention, the mass ratio between the total mass of the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid and the mass of water in the liquid phase (i.e., total mass of polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid/mass of water) is 60/40 to 95/5 from the viewpoint of suppressing the viscosity increase of the liquid phase, suppressing the production of an aldehyde, and improving the productivity. Preferably, it is 65/35 to 93/7, more preferably 70/30 to 90/10, and even more preferably 75/25 to 85/15. As described herein, content of water in the liquid phase indicates the total mass including water contained in other components such as a platinum catalyst as well as water added for the reaction. By adjusting the mass ratio between the total mass of a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid and the mass of water to be within the range described above, not only the significant viscosity increase according to the reaction can be suppressed but also the production of an aldehyde compound as a side product can be suppressed, and thus the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid as an intended product can be obtained at a high yield. Although a detailed reason for obtaining such an effect remains unclear, it is assumed that a state having a high viscosity in which a water content is low and water forms a continuous phase changes into another phase having a low viscosity in which oil forms a continuous phase within the above disclosed range of the mass ratio of the total mass of a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid to the mass of water. In the manufacturing method of the present invention, the mass ratio between the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and water in the liquid phase (i.e., mass of polyoxyethylene alkyl ether/mass of water) at the time of starting the reaction is, from the viewpoint of suppressing the viscosity increase of the liquid phase, suppressing the production of an aldehyde, and improving the productivity, preferably 60/40 to 95/5, more preferably 65/35 to 93/7, even more preferably 70/30 to 90/10, and even more preferably 75/25 to 85/15. As described herein, "at the time of starting the reaction" means the time point at which oxygen is fed into the liquid phase containing the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and water in the presence of the platinum catalyst. In the manufacturing method of the present invention, the total mass of a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid in the liquid phase is, from the viewpoint of suppressing the viscosity increase of the liquid phase, suppressing the production of an aldehyde, and improving the productivity, preferably 60 to 95% by mass, more preferably 65 to 93% by mass, even more preferably 70 to 90% by mass, and even more preferably 75 to 85% by mass. In the manufacturing method of the present invention, the mass of water in the liquid phase is, from the viewpoint of suppressing the viscosity increase of the liquid phase, suppressing the production of an aldehyde, and improving the productivity, preferably 5 to 40% by mass, more preferably 7 to 35% by mass, even more preferably 10 to 30% by mass, and even more preferably 15 to 25% by mass. In the manufacturing method of the present invention, the total mass of the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and water in the liquid phase at the time of starting the reaction is, from the viewpoint of suppressing the viscosity increase of the liquid phase, suppressing the production of an aldehyde, and improving the productivity, preferably 65% by mass or more, more preferably 72% by mass or more, even more preferably 80% by mass or more, even more preferably 90% by mass or more, and even more preferably 95% by mass or more. In the manufacturing method of the present invention, as long as the content of water in the liquid phase is within the above range, an organic solvent may also be used in addition to water, if necessary. Examples of the organic solvent which may be used include glycol ethers such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, methyl ethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, triethylene glycol dimethyl ether, and propylene glycol ether, acetonitrile, and tert-butanol. From the viewpoint of suppressing the productivity from decreasing, the decreasing being due to removing an organic solvent, the content of the organic solvent in the liquid phase is preferably 50% by mass or less, more preferably 40% by mass or less, even more preferably 30% by mass or less, even more preferably 20% by mass or less, even more preferably 10% by mass or less, even more preferably 5% by mass or less, and even more preferably 0% by mass. Further, the total mass of water and the organic solvent in the liquid phase is, from the viewpoint of suppressing the productivity from decreasing, due to removing an organic solvent, preferably 5 to 50% by mass, more preferably 5 to 40% by mass, even more preferably 7 to 35% by mass even more preferably 10 to 30% by mass, and even more preferably 15 to 25% by mass. Feeding oxygen into the liquid phase can be conducted by blowing oxygen gas or oxygen-containing mixture gas (e.g., air) into the liquid phase. Alternatively, it may also be performed by having a gas phase introduction of oxygen gas or an oxygen-containing mixture gas and carrying out the reaction under the atmosphere of those gases. When oxygen-containing mixture gas is used, specific examples of the gas used in combination with oxygen are preferably so-called inert gas such as helium, argon, or nitrogen. The oxygen concentration in the gas is preferably 10% by volume or more, more preferably 20% by volume or more, even more preferably 50% by volume or more, even more preferably 70% by volume or more, and even more preferably 100% by volume. The reaction temperature at the time of dehydrogenating and oxidizing a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether is, from the viewpoint of improving the reactivity and suppressing selectivity from decreasing, preferably 50 to 100°C, more preferably 50 to 80°C, and even more preferably 60 to 80°C. The reaction pressure may be any one of atmospheric pressure and an increased pressure. According to the manufacturing method of the present invention, a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid can be obtained at a high effective concentration only with a process of filtering the catalyst after completion of the reaction without requiring an operation of removing inorganic salts or a complicated operation for concentration, compared to a case in which carboxymethylation, alkali neutralization oxidation, or non-neutralization oxidation, being conventional, is applied. When the compound represented by formula (I) is used as a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether for the manufacturing method of the present invention, it is possible to obtain a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid which is represented by the following formula (II). R-(CH2-O-CH2)n-COOH (II) [in the formula, R and n have the same meanings as defined in formula (I)]. Further, regarding the manufacturing method of the present invention, when a compound represented by the above formula (III) is used as a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid represented by the following formula (IV) can be obtained. R1(R2)CH-(O-CH2-CH2)m-1-O-CH2-COOH (IV) [in the formula, R1, R2, and m have the same meanings as defined in formula (III)]. In the present invention, it is preferable that the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether is manufactured by the following step (1) and step (2): (1) A step of adding ethylene oxide to an alcohol having a hydrocarbon group with 4 to 22 carbon atoms in the presence of an alkali catalyst to obtain a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether represented by formula (I).(2) A step of decreasing the alcohol having a hydrocarbon group with 4 to 22 carbon atoms, which is included in the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether product mixture obtained from step (1), to 3.0% by mass or less. Hereinbelow, step (1) and step (2) are explained in detail. <Step (1) > As for the alcohol having a hydrocarbon group with 4 to 22 carbon atoms which is used for Step (1), an alcohol having a hydrocarbon group with 6 to 16 carbon atoms is preferable, and an alcohol having a hydrocarbon group with 8 to 14 carbon atoms is more preferable from the viewpoint of exhibition of the performance of the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid represented by formula (I) as a surfactant. Specific examples of the alcohol having a hydrocarbon group with 4 to 22 carbon atoms include such as butanol, hexanol, octanol, decanol, dodecanol, tetradecanol, hexadecanol, octadecatnol, eiscosanol, and docosanol. From the viewpoint of exhibition of the performance of the ether acetic acid as a surfactant, hexanol, octanol, decanol, dodecanol, tetradecanol and hexadecanol are preferable. As for the hydrocarbon group, a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group having a linear, branched, or cyclic structure is preferable. A linear or branched alkyl group or alkenyl group is more preferable. A linear or branched alkyl group is even more preferable. A linear alkyl group is even more preferable. From the viewpoint of improving the reactivity and productivity, the reaction of Step (1) is performed in the presence of an alkali catalyst. Examples of the alkali catalyst include such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and calcium hydroxide. From the viewpoint of the reactivity and easy availability, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are more preferable. The addition reaction in Step (1) may be conducted in the same manner as Step (2) of Example 7, for example, and a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether represented by formula (I) can be obtained. Meanwhile, in the manufacturing method of the present invention, a commercially available product such as EMULGEN 103, EMULGEN 106, or EMULGEN 108 manufactured by Kao Corporation may be used as a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether of formula (I) instead of performing Step (1). <Step (2) > In Step (2), from the viewpoint of improving the conversion rate and suppressing the generation of an aldehyde, the alcohol having a hydrocarbon group with 4 to 22 carbon atoms, which is included in the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether product mixture obtained from Step (1), is decreased preferably to 3.0% by mass or less, more preferably to 0.01 to 2.8% by mass, even more preferably to 0.05 to 2.5% by mass, even more preferably to 0.07 to 2.0% by mass, even more preferably to 0.09 to 1.5% by mass, and even more preferably to 0.1 to 1.0% by mass. Although the reason remains unclear for increasing of the conversion rate by decreasing the alcohol having a hydrocarbon group with 4 to 22 carbon atoms, which is included in a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether product, to the aforementioned range, it is assumed that chemical species derived from an alcohol, containing no added alkylene oxide chain, inhibit the catalytic activity. As for the method of decreasing the alcohol having a hydrocarbon group with 4 to 22 carbon atoms in Step (2), distillation, column separation, extraction, or the like can be mentioned. From the viewpoint of easy operability and removal efficiency, distillation and column separation are preferable. Distillation is more preferable. As for the method of removing alcohol, it is preferable that a removal method based on distillation operation is applied. The distillation operation is conducted by distillation of an alcohol with no added alkylene oxide, which has the lowest boiling point, by heating to 150°C to 250°C under a reduced pressure of several kPa to about 1 kPa. A polyoxyethylene alkyl ether is obtained as a distillation residue in which an alcohol not added with an alkylene oxide chain is reduced. The dehydrogenating and oxidizing reaction of the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether obtained from Step (2) is performed by, as described above, feeding oxygen into a liquid phase containing the polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and water in the presence of the platinum catalyst.
