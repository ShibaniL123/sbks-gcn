Preparation of trans-2,2-dichloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(2-(pyridin-2-yl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamide (F2502)
To a solution of trans-2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzoic acid (C12) (0.080 g, 0.176 mmol) and 2-(1-methylhydrazinyl)pyridine (0.033 g, 0.265 mmol) in ethyl acetate (2 mL) at room temperature were added sequentially diisopropylethylamine (0.123 mL, 0.706 mmol) and 2,4,6-tripropyl-1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxatriphosphinane 2,4,6-trioxide (T3PÂ®; 0.225 g, 0.353 mmol) as a 50% solution in ethyl acetate. The reaction mixture was stirred for 18 hours at room temperature and then concentrated under a stream of nitrogen. Purification by column chromatography using 0-100% ethyl acetate; hexanes as eluent afforded the title compound as a yellow solid (0.019 g, 20%).
