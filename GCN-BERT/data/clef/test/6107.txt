Step 4: Preparation of N-(3-(4-(morpholine-4-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)-N-phenylpentaneamide
A final product, N-(3-(4-(morpholine-4-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)-N-phenylpentaneamide, was obtained (371 mg, yield 90%) by the same method as described in Step 5 of Example 1 using the N-phenylpentaneamide (143 mg, 0.81 mmol) obtained in Step 1 of Example 1 and the 3-(4-(morpholine-4-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl methanesulfonate (391 mg, 1.21 mmol) obtained in Step 3.
