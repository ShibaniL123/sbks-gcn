FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to the fields of biochemistry, molecular biology, and molecular virology; particularly, the invention relates to a structural protein of rotavirus, VP6 protein, a method for preparing the protein, and a method for in vitro assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) containing the protein, wherein the protein and the VLPs may be useful for preventing or alleviating diarrhea caused by rotavirus infection. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Rotavirus (RV) belongs to the rotavirus genus belonging to the Reoviridae family, which is the main pathogen responsible for infant diarrhea and was found in duodenum from patients with gastroenteritis by Bishop in 1973 (Bishop, Davidson et al. 1973). Studies showed that more than 95% of children were infected with rotavirus at least once before 5 years old. According to statistics from WHO, up to 600,000 people died of rotavirus infection annually, cases of diarrhea reached up to 200 million; and in USA only, economic loss caused by rotavirus infection reached up to 100 million dollars annually (Hsu, Staat et al. 2005; Tate, Burton et al. 2011), resulting in serious financial burden and social burden. Rotavirus is a nonenveloped RNA virus. The genome of rotavirus consists of 11 double-stranded RNA molecules which encode 6 structure proteins (VP1-VP4, VP6 and VP7) and 6 non-structure proteins (NSP1-NSP6) (Estes and Cohen 1989). Rotavirus is icosahedral, and its capsid consists of three concentric layers, i.e. the core layer consisting of VP1, VP2 and VP3, the inner capsid consisting of VP6, and the outer capsid consisting of VP4 and VP7. VP6 is a species-specific antigen, and depending on its antigenicity, rotavirus may be divided into 7 groups, i.e. rotavirus A-G, among which rotavirus A is the main pathogen responsible for diarrhea among infants and young children. The protein has a strong immunogenicity, and although it is not a neutralizing antigen, it can have a good immune protection (Sabara, Frenchick et al. 1994). VP4 and VP7 are the main neutralizing antigens, and, rotavirus A can be divided into serotype P and serotype G depending on the antigenicity of them, and can be divided into different genotypes depending on their genes. G type and P type are independent of each other and are also interacted; the common combinations include G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8] and G4P[8]; in recent years, G9P[8] and G9P[6] are more and more popular (Li, Liu et al. 2009). There are not specific drugs for rotavirus yet, and safe and effective vaccines are the important means for control of rotavirus infection. After years of research undergoing three phases, i.e. monovalent attenuated vaccines, polyvalent gene recombinant vaccines, and genetically engineering vaccines, there are four rotavirus vaccines appeared in the market one by one, including tetravalent human-ape gene recombinant vaccine from Wyeth, monovalent attenuated vaccine from Lanzhou Institute, pentavalent human-bovine gene recombinant vaccine from Merck, and monovalent attenuated vaccine from GSK. However, these vaccines are attenuated live vaccines which have large potential safety hazard, and the vaccines from Wyeth were recalled due to intestinal intussusception half a year after being in the market (Murphy, Gargiullo et al. 2001); although the vaccines from MERCK and GSK were demonstrated to be safe and effective by a large number of clinical tests (Bernstein, Sack et al. 1999; Vesikari, Matson et al. 2006; Linhares, Velazquez et al. 2008; Vesikari, Itzler et al. 2009; Snelling, Andrews et al. 2011), in countries and regions with a high rotavirus mortality such as Asia and Africa, the protection efficiency was much lower than that in developed countries such as Europe and America (Armah, Sow et al. 2010; Zaman, Anh et al. 2010; Madhi, Cunliffe et al. 2011). More and more evidence showed that upon vaccination with these two vaccines, shedding of virus occurred and horizontal transmission of virus might occur (Anderson 2008; Rivera, Pena et al. 2011; Yen, Jakob et al. 2011). It was also shown in some studies that serious gastroenteritis might be developed in children with immunologic deficiency after vaccination with the vaccines (Steele, Cunliffe et al. 2009; Patel, Hertel et al. 2010). The vaccines from Lanzhou Institute have been commercially available for more than 10 years, and no serious problem is found yet; however, they can only prevent serious diarrhea, and cannot prevent rotavirus infection (Fu, Wang et al. 2007). Therefore, although delightful results are obtained in studies on attenuated vaccines for rotavirus, there are also some problems and the safety and effectiveness need to be further improved. It is imperative to develop more safe and effective vaccines. Non-replicating vaccines are the main direction for studies on rotavirus vaccines now, and genetically engineering vaccines attract much attention because of the characteristics such as low cost, safety and effectiveness. Genetically engineering vaccines mainly refer to antigens of rotavirus expressed by genetically engineering methods, which are used to immunize animal or human so as to achieve immune protection. Such vaccines include nucleic acid vaccines, synthetic peptide vaccines, recombinantly expressed antigen vaccine, and virus-like particles (VLPs) vaccines. The effectiveness and safety of VLPs vaccines now have been sufficiently demonstrated in the case of HBV, HEV and HPV vaccines, and have become a new generation of candidate vaccines with the greatest research value, as well recognized globally. The studies on RV-VLPs vaccines started in 80s of the last century, and a lot of animal experimental results showed that RV-VLP vaccines had good protective effect and could mediate a broad heterogenic protection. RV-VLP refers to virus-like particle consisting of structure proteins, which is similar to native virus particle in terms of shape and structure and retains the native conformation of virus particle without containing viral nucleic acids. The particles can be divided into two classes; one class is a trilayer particle consisting of VP2, VP4, VP6 and VP7, or a double-layered particle consisting of VP6 & VP4, VP7, both of which can stimulate the generation of neutralizing antibodies in organisms (Crawford, Estes et al. 1999; Jiang, Estes et al. 1999); and the other class is a double-layered particle consisting of VP2 and VP6, and a monolayer particle consisting of VP6, which cannot stimulate the generation of neutralizing antibodies in organisms as they contain no neutralizing antigen, but also have a good protective effect as they can stimulate enhanced cell immunity in organisms (Coste, Sirard et al. 2000; Yuan, Geyer et al. 2000; Nguyen, Iosef et al. 2003); since variation in VP6 is relatively low, the particle can lead to a broad heterogenic protection. Relative to the first class of particles, the second class of particles have the same protective effect, but comprise less components, which greatly reduces processing difficulty and cost and thus are more favored. The key for VP2/6-VLP vaccine development is to produce homogeneous VLP samples efficiently in a large amount. Insect baculovirus expression systems are commonly used now, and the rotavirus structure proteins VP2 and VP6 co-expressed in the system may self-assemble into VLP (Bertolotti-Ciarlet, Ciarlet et al. 2003). However, eukaryotic expression systems have the shortcomings such as high cost, long period, complex operations, and low expression level, and non-specific proteins and nucleic acids are generally encapsulated during the assembly, and thus it is difficult to achieve high-efficient and controllable assembly (Palomares and Ramirez 2009). Although there are studies on in vitro assembly of rotavirus VLP particles, the further development of RV VLP vaccines are restricted due to low yield. Prokaryotic expression system has advantages such as low cost and simple operation. However, since prokaryotic expression system lacks specific posttranslational modifications, many proteins form inclusion bodies in prokaryotic expression. In current, there are studies showing that structure proteins of rotavirus were expressed in prokaryotic system, including VP6, VP4 and VP7, which were either expressed in inclusion bodies and unable to be renaturated effectively (Zhao, Chen et al. 2011), or expressed in a fusion form (Choi, Basu et al. 2000). Although fusion expression is favorable for the purification of desired proteins, expensive enzymes are generally required for cleavage of fusion proteins. Thus, prokaryotic expression system is not suitable for large-scale production. Therefore, this field still demands techniques with low cost which can achieve high-efficient and controllable assembly and produce rotavirus structure proteins and virus-like particles at a large scale. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The object of the invention is to provide a novel method for preparing double-layered virus-like particles of rotavirus, wherein the double-layered particles consist of rotavirus VP2 protein and VP6 protein. The inventors discovered surprisingly after the research that structural protein VP6 of rotavirus may be expressed in E. coli in a soluble form, and the purified VP6 is present in a form of trimer and may be self-assembled into a monolayer virus-like particle 6-VLP or assembled with VP2 in a VLP state or in a non-VLP state to form a double-layered virus-like particle 2/6-VLP; and the VP6 protein and VLPs thereof can be used for preventing or reducing clinical symptoms caused by rotavirus infection.

According to the invention, in the method for obtaining virus-like particle 2/6-VLP, the buffer refers to a solution that is stable within a weak acidic pH range (pH3.0-7.0), including, but not limited to, phosphate buffer, MES buffer, citrate buffer, and the like. Beneficial Effect of the Invention Presently, eukaryotic expression systems are used in the preparation of rotavirus VLPs, and the insect-baculovirus expression system is the most commonly used. The VP2 and VP6 proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems are closer to naturally occurring proteins in terms of conformation, and can self-assemble into VLPs in vivo. However, eukaryotic expression systems have the shortcomings, such as long expression period, complex operation, low expression level, non-specific encapsulation of undesired proteins and nucleic acids in assembly process, especially the formation of different types of virus-like particles during co-expression of several proteins, and difficulty in subsequent purification, and thus can hardly achieve assembly in a high efficient and controllable manner. It is quite difficult to apply a eukaryotic expression system to industrial production in a large scale. Prokaryotic expression system, especially E. coli expression system has advantages such as low cost, short period, and high expression level, and are the most commonly used and well established expression system for recombinant proteins. However, the rotavirus capsid protein expressed in E. coli expression system is generally unable to form a correct confirmation and is in a form of inclusion body, while the protein in inclusion body is difficult to be renaturated, and the efficiency is low. Thus, it is difficult to apply a prokaryotic expression system to a large-scale production. Fusion expression can accomplish soluble expression of VP6, but expensive enzymes are generally required for cleavage of a fusion protein generally. Thus, fusion expression cannot be applied to a large-scale production. In the invention, the capsid protein VP6 of rotavirus A is expressed in the E. coli expression system; most of nucleic acids and some undesired proteins can be removed by a pretreatment of PEI or metal ion precipitation, and the VP6 protein is still kept in supernatant in a soluble form. After salting-out and chromatographic purification, VP6 protein with a purity of above 95% can be obtained. After analysis, the protein is present in a form of trimer in the solution, i.e. retains the correct conformation of VP6 protein. The process has the advantages such as simple operation, low cost and high yield, and thus can be applied to industrial production in a large scale. The purified VP6 protein obtained by said steps can be self-assembled into a monolayer particle 6-VLP, and can also be co-assembled with VP2 in a particulate or non-particulate state to form a double-layered particle 2/6-VLP. The process is simple and controllable, and has an assembly efficiency of above 95%, significantly higher than the efficiency of self-assembly of the protein expressed in a eukaryotic cell. As verified experimentally in mice, VP6 protein and its VLPs obtained by prokaryotic expression have high immunogenicity and good protective effect, and are potential as a candidate vaccine for rotavirus. Therefore, the invention has the following advantages. The preparation method of the invention neither needs high cost and complex process (as eukaryotic expression needs), nor needs expensive enzymes, and are convenient with respect to operation and cheap with respect to cost. Moreover, the preparation method retains the correct conformation of VP6 since the purification process does not undergo drastic denaturation and renaturation. The protein may be self-assembled into 6-VLP or co-assembled with VP2 to form 2/6-VLP, has a good immunogenicity, and exhibits a good immune protection in mouse experiments. The methods of the invention for preparing VP6 protein and virus-like particles (VLPs) thereof may be applied to industrial production in a large scale. The VP6 protein and VLPs thereof of the invention may be used for preventing diarrhea caused by rotavirus infection.

Single colonies were transferred to 4 ml liquid LB media containing kanamycin and were cultured at 37° C. with shaking until OD600 reached about 0.6. 0.5 ml bacterial solution was added to glycerol (a final concentration of 10%) and stored at −20° C. or −80° C. The remaining bacteria were added with IPTG to a concentration of 0.8 mM, and were further cultured at 37° C. for 2-4 h. Then, 1.5 mL bacteria were collected and were added with 100 uL ddH2O to re-suspend the bacteria. 20 uL 6×Loading Buffer was added, mixed thoroughly, and was placed in a water-bath at 100° C. for 10 min. As identified by 10% SDS-PAGE, a protein band of about 45 KDa in size was clearly observed. The bacteria carrying the recombinant plasmid P-VP6 obtained in the previous step were taken out from −80° C. refrigerator, were thawed, and then 5 μL were seeded in 50 mL LB medium containing kanamycin and incubated at 200 rpm and 37° C. overnight. The resultant solution was used as a seed solution. The seed solution was transferred to 15 flasks at a ratio of 1:1000, each of the flasks contained 500 mL Auto-Induction Medium (containing 10 g peptone, 5 g yeast powder, 10 g NaCl, 0.5 g glucose, 5 mL glycerol and 5 g α-lactose per liter, the pH of which was adjusted to neutral with NaOH solution), and was incubated in a shaking incubator at 180 rpm and 37° C. until the OD600 reached about 0.6. The temperature was then adjusted to 20° C., the bacteria were collected by centrifugation 20 h later, to get about 30 g bacteria expressing VP6 protein. Preparation of VP6 Protein with a Purity of about 85% Bacteria were re-suspended at a proportion of 1 g bacteria corresponding to 15 ml lysis solution. Bacteria were disrupted by ultrasonication in an ice-water bath, for 4 min per 1 g bacteria, with a 4 s-interval every 2 s. The resultant solution was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm using JA-14 rotor for 15 min, and the supernatant was retained. The supernatant was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. At this stage, the VP6 protein in the supernatant had a purity of about 10% (as shown in FIG. 1, Lane 1). The lysis supernatant was subpackaged into 1 ml per tube. To each tube, 0.05%-0.5% polyethyleneimine (PEI) or 10-100 mM MnCl2, MgCl2 or CaCl2 was added, and the mixture was homogeneously mixed. Centrifugation was performed 30 min later, the supernatant was taken, and saturated ammonia sulfate was added to a concentration of 40%. After homogeneous mixing, standing for 0.5-2 h, and centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded. The precipitate was re-dissolved in 1/5 volume of buffer, and it was found by 10% SDS-PAGE that PEI or metal ion precipitation could remove a lot of nucleic acids and undesired proteins; after further purification and concentration posterior to ammonia sulfate precipitation, the purity of VP6 protein was greatly improved, wherein the purity was best improved at 20 mM CaCl2 (as shown in FIG. 1B, Lane 2). In an ice-water bath, to the solution of disrupted bacteria, 2M CaCl2 solution was added under stirring to a final concentration of 20 mM. 30 min later, the resultant solution was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm using JA-14 rotor for 15 min, and the supernatant was retained. In an ice-water bath, solid ammonia sulfate was added under stirring to a saturation of 25%. The resultant mixture was placed in an ice-water bath for 1-2 h, and then was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm using JA-14 rotor for 15 min. The precipitate was kept and was re-suspended in 1/10 volume of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH7.0+3M NaCl. The resultant mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm using JA-14 rotor for 15 min, and the supernatant was kept. It was found by 10% SDS-PAGE that CaCl2 precipitation could remove a lot of nucleic acids and undesired proteins, after further purification and concentration posterior to ammonia sulfate precipitation, the purity of VP6 protein was increased from 10% to about 85% (as shown in FIG. 1, Lanes 2 and 3).

After centrifugation, the precipitate was taken and was re-suspended in 1/10 volume of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, and then was centrifuged. After centrifugation, the supernatant was taken. At this stage the VP2 had a purity of above 80% (as shown in FIG. 2, Lane 3).

Column Volume: 5.5 cm×20 cm Buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0+2M NaCl Flow Rate: 10 mL/min Detector Wavelength: 280 nm Sample: VP2 protein solution in the last step, which had a purity of about 80%, and was filtered through a filter membrane with an aperture of 0.22 μm. Elution protocol: eluting the undesired proteins with 150 mM NaCl, eluting the VP2 protein with 500 mM NaCl, collecting the eluate eluted with 500 mM NaCl, with a purity of about 95% as identified by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie brilliant blue staining (as shown in FIG. 2, Lane 4), with a yield of above 50%. Example 3 Identification of Rotavirus VP6 and VP2 Protein The samples were the VP6 protein with a purity of above 98% obtained in Example 1 and VP2 protein with a purity of above 95% obtained in Example 2. SDS-PAGE The samples were treated in the following four manners, respectively: 1) the loading buffer comprising mercaptoethanol was used, and the samples were treated in a water bath at 100° C. for 10 min; 2) the loading buffer comprising mercaptoethanol was used; 3) the loading buffer free of mercaptoethanol was used, and the samples were treated in a water bath at 100° C. for 10 min; 4) the loading buffer free of mercaptoethanol was used. After separation by 10% SDS-PAGE, the protein was identified by coomassie brilliant blue staining. The SDS-PAGE results showed that the purified VP2 protein was present in a form of monomer or in a form of hydrophobic polymer, but the conformation was affected by disulfide bond, and VP6 was present in a form of polymer. Size Exclusion Chromatographic Analysis Equipment: AKTA Purifier UPC-100 preparative liquid chromatography system produced by GE Healthcare Chromatographic column: Superdex200, 10 mm×300 mm (GE Healthcare), with a column volume of 24 mL Buffer: Tris-HCl, pH8.0+500 mM NaCl for VP2; Tris-HCl, pH7.0+2M NaCl for VP6 Flow Rate: 0.5 mL/min Detector Wavelength: UV280nm The results showed that the purified VP2 protein and VP6 protein each were a single component, and had a retention time of 27.34 and 33.91 min, respectively, and were homogenous. Analytic Ultracentrifugation The equipment was Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuger, and the methods were sedimentation velocity method and sedimentation equilibrium method. Firstly, the sedimentation coefficients of VP2 protein and VP6 protein were analyzed by sedimentation velocity method, SEDIFIT software was used to carry out C(S) analysis, and the molecular weights of VP2 protein and VP6 protein were calculated primarily. The results showed that VP2 protein and VP6 protein might be present in a form of dimer and trimer, respectively. On the basis of this, the precise molecular weights of VP2 protein and VP6 protein were further analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium method. Origin Nonlin software and SEDPHAT software were used to analyze SE. The results showed that VP2 protein and VP6 protein had a molecular weight of 204±5.6 KDa and 114.9±1.6 KDa, respectively (FIG. 3C and FIG. 3D). VP2 protein of native state is present in a form of dimer, and VP6 protein is present in a form of trimer, and their theoretic molecular weights are 205 KDa and 135 KDa, respectively. It was identified by analytic ultracentrifugation that the purified VP2 protein had a molecular weight of 204±5.6 KDa, which was consistent with the theoretic molecular weight. However, since SDS can interrupt hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction, VP2 in SDS-PAGE is mainly in a form of monomer. It was identified by analytic ultracentrifugation that the purified VP6 protein had a molecular weight of 114.9±1.6 KDa, and was present in a form of polymer in SDS-PAGE, which was between 119 and 211 KDa in size. According to the SDS-PAGE results in combination with the analytic ultracentrifugation results, the purified VP6 protein was present in a form of trimer. It was consistent with the result of size exclusion chromatography, i.e. the retention time of VP2 protein was shorter than that of VP6 protein. Accordingly, VP2 and VP6 protein obtained by prokaryotic expression retained their native confirmations. Moreover, the whole process was simple and was convenient for operation, and thus had incomparable advantages relative to eukaryotic expression.

Example 7 Evaluation of Immunogenicity of VP6 Protein The immunogenicity of VP6 protein was evaluated in a mouse model. The animals to be immunized were SPF grade female Balb/C mice of 5-8 weeks old (purchased from Shanghai Slac Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd), 3 mice per group, and the samples were VP6 protein obtained in Example 1, 6-VLP and 2/6-VLP obtained in Example 5 and rotavirus A obtained by MA104 cell culture. Said samples were mixed with an equal volume of Freund's adjuvant (complete Freund's adjuvant was used for primary immunization, and incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used for booster), the immunization dose was 100 μg, and the immunization route was subcutaneous immunization; or said samples were mixed with aluminum adjuvant, and the immunization dose was 1-100 μg, and the immunization route was muscular injection. The immunization procedure was as followed: the primary immunization at Day 0, and the boosters at Day 7 and Day 14. Peripheral venous blood was taken from mice every week, serum was isolated, the titer of VP6 antibody in serum was determined by an EIA method. The procedure was as followed: 1) coating: the sample was VP6 protein obtained in Example 1, the buffer was 50 mM carbonate buffer pH9.6, the coating concentration was 500 ng/mL, the coating amount was 100 μL per well, and the coating condition was 37° C., 2 h;2) washing: PBST (20 mM PBS+0.05% Tween20), once, drying by bottom up;3) blocking: the blocking solution was PBS+0.5% casein, the blocking condition was 2004 per well, 37° C., 2 h; after blocking, drying by bottom up;4) loading: sample: mouse serum; the diluent was PBS+10% calf serum; 10-fold serial dilution; 100 μL per well, 37° C., 30 min;5) washing: PBST, 5 times, drying by bottom up:6) adding an enzyme-labeled second antibody: the enzyme-labeled second antibody was GAM-HRP, the diluent was PBS+0.5% casein, the dilution fold was 1:5000, 100 μL per well, 37° C., 30 min;7) washing: PBST, 5 times, drying by bottom up;8) developing: TMB developing solution, 100 μL per well, 37° C., 15 min;9) stopping: stop buffer, 50 μL per well;10) readout: Antos enzyme-labeling equipment, OD450/600. The greatest dilution fold, at which OD450/600 was of greater than 0.2, was determined as antibody titer in mouse serum. The results showed that as compared to an equal amount of inactivated virus, VP6 antigen had a higher immunogenicity; and Freund's adjuvant could better improve the immunogenicity of VP6 protein as compared to aluminum adjuvant (FIG. 10). Example 8 Evaluation of Immune Protection of VP6 Protein and VLP Thereof Since VP6 antibodies do not have in vitro neutralizing activity and adult mice have poor sensitivity to rotavirus, a pregnant mice-neonatal mice model is used to evaluate immune protection of VP6 protein. 4-5 week old SPF-grade female Balb/c mice were divided into five groups, VP6 obtained in Example 1, 6-VLP and 2/6-VLP obtained in Example 5, rotavirus A obtained by MA104 cell culture, or PBS was mixed with an equal volume of Freund's adjuvant (complete Freund's adjuvant was used for primary immunization, and incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used for booster), the immunization route was subcutaneous immunization, and the immunization dose was 10 μg VP6 per mouse. The immunization procedure was as followed: the primary immunization at Day 0, and the boosters at Day 10 and Day 20, and a final booster at Day 30 (using antigens in the same dose mixed with aluminum adjuvant by muscular injection). Peripheral venous blood was taken two weeks after the last immunization, and serum was isolated and stored for further detection. Female mice and male mice were kept in the same cage, and male mice were taken out after mating. Neonatal mice were challenged with a virus 4-6 days after birth, at a dose of 5*106 TCID50 per neonatal mouse, wherein the virus was human rotavirus obtained by MA104 cell culture. After challenging with the virus, health condition of the neonatal mice was observed and recorded, such as diarrhea condition, and change in weight. A mouse was killed at each of 0, 24, 48 and 72 hpc, pathological changes in tissues of the mice were observed after anatomy, small intestine tissues were taken, and the virus was detected by methods such as immunohistochemistry and EIA. In addition, serum was isolated and titer of serum antibody was determined by EIA. VP6 Immunogenicity and Passage of Maternal Antibody Titers of VP6 antibody were determined by EIA in sera of mother mice and neonatal mice from different immunization groups. The coated antigen was VP6 protein recombinantly expressed in E. coli, the coated amount was 50 ng/well, and the method was as described in Example 7. FIG. 11A showed the titers of VP6 antibody in sera of mother mice, wherein VP6, 6-VLP and 2/6-VLP all had a high immunogenicity and had no significant difference. FIG. 11B shows the titer of VP6 antibody in sera of neonatal mice, indicating that maternal antibody resulted from non-mucosa immunization was effectively passed to offspring via placenta and breast milk. Protective Effect of VP6 Antibody from Mother Mice on Diarrhea of Neonatal Mice After challenging with virus, diarrhea condition was monitored in neonatal mice. Mice were scored depending on the color and shape of feces, and it was found that diarrhea was most serious in neonatal mice 24 h after challenging with virus. The results were shown in Table 5. Within 24 h after challenging with virus, obvious diarrhea symptoms developed in the control group, while no diarrhea or only mild diarrhea symptoms developed in the experimental groups. Antibodies from mother mice immunized with VP6, 6-VLP, 2/6-VLP and inactivated virus alleviated the symptoms of diarrhea in neonatal mice, there was no significant difference among antibodies from mother mice immunized with VP6, 2/6-VLP and inactivated virus with respect to immune protection (P value was 0.070 and 0.946, respectively), while immune protection of 6-VLP was significantly lower than that of RV (P=0.001) and 2/6-VLP (P<0.001).
