CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This patent application claims the benefit of priority to (i) U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/703,282 entitled “ANKLE REPLACEMENT DEVICES AND METHODS OF MAKING AND USING THE SAME” filed on Sep. 20, 2012, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to ankle replacement devices and methods of making and using ankle replacement devices. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Total ankle arthroplasty is a common treatment to replace the damaged talocrural joint due to wear, fatigue, and trauma. This joint structure can be damaged from arthritis, bone fractures, displasia, or other degenerative mechanisms. Many of the FDA-approved devices only feature a saddle-type joint that allows flexion and extension, but limited talocrural stability during inversion and eversion. Further, the structure of ankle replacement devices currently available on the U.S. market also have an ability to dislocate from internal rotations that exist on the tibia and talus during loading. In addition, current total ankle replacements are static in displacement and cannot be adjusted post-operation for limb length discrepancies that are found in the patient. There exists a need in the art for improved ankle replacement devices that (i) allow flexion and extension, as well as increased stability for inversion and eversion joint movements, (ii) allows for length adjustments to account for limb length discrepancies that are found in many patients, and (iii) provide years of normal patient use. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to ankle replacement devices. The ankle replacement devices of the present invention have been designed to (i) provide a reliable total joint replacement for the talocrural joint designed for stability, range of motion, and wear resistance, and (ii) to allow for an optional lengthening mechanism for minimizing length variation of the lower extremities.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to ankle replacement devices and methods of making and using ankle replacement devices. In particular, the present invention is directed to ankle replacement devices as shown in the figures, as described in the various embodiments shown and described herein, and as recited in the claims below. An exemplary device 10 of the present invention is shown, for example, in FIGS. 1-8D. Another exemplary device 10 of the present invention is shown, for example, in FIGS. 9-22B. The ankle replacement devices of the present invention provide a patient with a stable ankle replacement and gives the physician an opportunity for limb length correction based on any pre-existing limb length discrepancy measurements. Historically, total ankle replacements have exhibited a probability of undergoing dislocation and component loosening during certain ankle movements. If internal rotation exists in the talus or tibia and the external force is great enough, the two components can separate or loosen due to joint instability. The coupling interface at the tibial and talar junction provides a semi-constrained encapsulation that uses a bearing surface on two depressed tracks to maintain joint integrity and physiological function. Current total ankle replacements are static in displacement and do not account for limb length correction due to variations that can occur prior or after the arthroplasty procedure has taken place. When the talar and tibial components are inserted, bone cement and/or biocompatible screws are used to fixate the components to bones. The disclosed device may be fixated to the tibia and talus using porous ceramic bone cement and/or bone screws. This type of bone cement provides a pathway for osteoclasts and osteoblasts to reconstruct scaffolding of the bone, which forms a biomaterial-bone integrated interface. This interface allows the material to become part of the bone and ensures fixation stability. To the implementing physicians installing the disclosed device, the disclosed device is similar to other available prostheses in size. In an operation scenario, the supporting physicians and/or nurses would measure limb length in pre-operation procedures to plan for the tibial and talar shearing. To account for the shearing length, the disclosed device would be set to an initial height and the appropriate spacer inserted (manufactured) prior to surgery so that the doctor will be able to insert the disclosed device as a two-component device. Aside from proper training on how to sufficiently raise or lower the disclosed device to account for limb length correction, the implantation procedure will be similar to those already in place. The disclosed device gives physicians a way of accounting for limb length discrepancies in patients. The displacement mechanism and locking mechanism enable the disclosed device to provide structural stability, as well as, account for post-operation discrepancies that can occur in patients. The disclosed device features a lengthening/shortening mechanism on the tibial insertion bracket that allows the implementing physician to account for length discrepancies. This mechanism occurs by increasing or decreasing the space in between the two brackets using a locking mechanism. For example, as shown in FIG. 3, a specifically-sized spacer (i.e., spacer 3 shown in FIG. 3) made of a hard plastic may be inserted into the interbracket space in order to ensure optimum device stability and overall length (i.e., to account for length discrepancies). In other embodiments, such as shown in FIG. 10, a specifically-sized second bracket (i.e., second bracket 3 having a desired thickness, sbt, as shown in FIG. 10) made of a hard plastic may be replaced (i.e., as needed, via a surgical procedure) in order to ensure optimum device stability and overall length (i.e., to account for length discrepancies). In one desired embodiment, the disclosed device of the present invention allows the patient to have 360 degrees of motion, with inversion and eversion. In some embodiments, the disclosed device will have one or more of the following features: (i) a dorsiflexion component up to about 25 degrees characteristic, (ii) a plantarflexion component having up to about 50 degrees characteristic, (iii) an inversion component having about a 20 degree characteristic, (iv) an eversion component having about a 10 degree characteristic, (v) an internal rotation characteristic up to about 5 degrees (i.e., as used herein, “internal rotation” refers to rotation of a first bone-engaging component (or component thereof) in relation to a second bone-engaging component (i.e., the talar component, component 12) in the medial direction), and (vi) an external rotation characteristic up to about 6 degrees (i.e., as used herein, “external rotation” refers to rotation of a first bone-engaging component (or component thereof) in relation to a second bone-engaging component (i.e., the talar component, component 12) in the lateral direction). It must be noted that physiological range of motion varies for a given individual. An established talar-tibial coupling joint will form greater support at the junction and prevent dislocations. By implementing an ellipsoid raised portion on the talar component coupled with the talar insertion cup on the tibial component, the range of motion will be strategically limited and the overall structure will form a stable connection at the joint (as shown in FIGS. 1-19). In some embodiments, two (2) tibial components, namely, the tibial bracket and the tibial attachment, have an integrated locking mechanism. As shown in FIGS. 9-10, the male-end of a flange on the tibial attachment is inserted into the corresponding resembling geometry female end of the tibial bracket and will rest in the integrated locking position that consists of material that remains at the end of the tibial bracket. The locking mechanism is completed by attachment of the tibial attachment to the first bone with bone-screw fixation. In some embodiments, the two (2) tibial components may be comprised of one or more of these locking mechanism areas, with the corresponding male and female ends being in the same corresponding direction per component, opposition of direction (one has male, one has female), or may encompass any combination of these for the ensured locking mechanism of these components. In some embodiments, there is a potential for development of a mobile-bearing device, one that does not exhibit a locking mechanism and relies on the user's anatomy to apply physiological constant compression for stability of the device. Further, in some embodiments, (i) the lower surface depression (i.e., lower surface depression 54) and (ii) the upper surface structure (i.e., upper surface structure 7) have have corresponding surface features that enable optimum connection therebetween. For example, as shown in FIGS. 17-19, upper surface 81 of upper surface structure 7 may comprise (1) at least two grooves 181 separated from one another and extending in a front to rear direction (i.e., a direction pointing from a person's heel to the person's toes) along upper surface 81, (2) a centrally-located track portion 182 between grooves 181, and (iii) outer track portions 183 on opposite outer portions of upper surface 81. As shown in FIGS. 17-19, centrally-located track portion 182 typically has a greater height (i.e., typically equal to hs) compared to height ho of outer track portions 183 on opposite outer portions of upper surface 81 (see, FIG. 18). As shown in FIG. 16, lower surface depression 54 of second bracket 2 of first base member 5 may comprise an interengaging surface configuration that corresponds to the surface configuration of upper surface 81 shown in FIGS. 17-19. For example, lower surface depression 54 may comprise (1) at least two rails 481 separated from one another and extending in a front to rear direction (i.e., a direction pointing from a person's heel to the person's toes) along lower surface depression 54 (i.e., so as to engage with two grooves 181 shown in FIGS. 17-19), (2) a centrally-located depression portion 482 between rails 481 (i.e., so as to contact/engage with centrally-located track portion 182 shown in FIGS. 17-19), and (iii) outer depression portions 483 on opposite outer portions of lower surface depression 54 (i.e., so as to contact/engage with outer track portions 183 shown in FIGS. 17-19).

EXAMPLES Example 1 Manufacture of Ankle Replacement Devices Ankle replacement devices, similar to devices 10 shown in FIGS. 1-21, were prepared, and surgically inserted as shown in FIG. 22B. It should be understood that although the above-described ankle replacement devices, kits, and methods are described as “comprising” one or more components or steps, the above-described ankle replacement devices, kits, and methods may “comprise,” “consists of,” or “consist essentially of” any of the above-described components, features or steps of the ankle replacement devices, kits, and methods. Consequently, where the present invention, or a portion thereof, has been described with an open-ended term such as “comprising,” it should be readily understood that (unless otherwise stated) the description of the present invention, or the portion thereof, should also be interpreted to describe the present invention, or a portion thereof, using the terms “consisting essentially of” or “consisting of” or variations thereof as discussed below. As used herein, the terms “comprises,” “comprising,” “includes,” “including,” “has,” “having,” “contains”, “containing,” “characterized by” or any other variation thereof, are intended to encompass a non-exclusive inclusion, subject to any limitation explicitly indicated otherwise, of the recited components. For example, a device, a kit, and/or method that “comprises” a list of elements (e.g., components, features or steps) is not necessarily limited to only those elements (or components or steps), but may include other elements (or components or steps) not expressly listed or inherent to the device, kit, and/or method. As used herein, the transitional phrases “consists of” and “consisting of” exclude any element, step, or component not specified. For example, “consists of” or “consisting of” used in a claim would limit the claim to the components, materials or steps specifically recited in the claim except for impurities ordinarily associated therewith (i.e., impurities within a given component). When the phrase “consists of” or “consisting of” appears in a clause of the body of a claim, rather than immediately following the preamble, the phrase “consists of” or “consisting of” limits only the elements (or components or steps) set forth in that clause; other elements (or components) are not excluded from the claim as a whole. As used herein, the transitional phrases “consists essentially of” and “consisting essentially of” are used to define a device, a kit, and/or method that includes materials, steps, features, components, or elements, in addition to those literally disclosed, provided that these additional materials, steps, features, components, or elements do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the claimed invention. The term “consisting essentially of” occupies a middle ground between “comprising” and “consisting of”. Further, it should be understood that the herein-described ankle replacement devices, kits, and methods may comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of any of the herein-described components and features, as shown in the figures with or without any feature(s) not shown in the figures. In other words, in some embodiments, the ankle replacement devices, kits, and/or methods of the present invention do not have any additional features other than those shown in the figures, and such additional features, not shown in the figures, are specifically excluded from the ankle replacement devices, kits, and/or methods. In other embodiments, the ankle replacement devices, kits, and/or methods of the present invention do have one or more additional features that are not shown in the figures. While the specification has been described in detail with respect to specific embodiments thereof, it will be appreciated that those skilled in the art, upon attaining an understanding of the foregoing, may readily conceive of alterations to, variations of, and equivalents to these embodiments.
