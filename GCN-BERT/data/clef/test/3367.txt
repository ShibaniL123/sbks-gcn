A PORTABLE STAND-UP DESK KIT Technical Field [0001] The invention relates to a portable stand-up desk kit for use on a supporting surface to form a stand-up desk with the supporting surface. The invention has particular, but not exclusive, application in using the portable stand-up desk kit to form a stand-up desk having a first working surface elevated from the supporting surface and, in a further application, a second working surface elevated from the first working surface. Background of Invention [0002] Existing stand-up desks are used primarily by people that have back ailments or back injuries or by those who generally find it beneficial to stand while working rather than sit for long periods of time at a conventional desk. These known stand-up desks are, however, permanent fixtures that are designed for use by particular people instead of using a conventional desk. [0003] in some known cases, effort has been made by, say, employers of people with back ailments to convert existing conventional desks to stand-up desks. For example, a bench is placed on a conventional desk to provide an elevated working surface for a user to work at that desk in a standing position. In this example, the user can operate, say, a computer with a keyboard and monitor resting on the elevated working surface whilst the user is in the standing position. It is not always convenient, however, for such a user to carry their own bench with them to convert existing conventional desks to stand-up desks wherever they desire to work. Summary of Invention [0004] According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a portable stand-up desk kit for use on a supporting surface to form a stand-up desk with the supporting surface, the portable stand-up desk kit including a first surface rotatably connected to a second surface about a surface hinging means, the first and second surfaces being parallel and spaced apart to define an interior portion therebetween in a closed position, and the first and second surfaces being substantially co-planar when rotated to an open position about the surface hinging means to form a first working surface for the stand-up desk, wherein the interior portion includes one or more first support means configured to be connected to an underside of the first and second surfaces at one end of the first support means and to engage the supporting surface at the other end when in the open position so as to elevate the first working surface of the stand-up desk from the supporting surface. [0005] Thus, for example, a user can form a stand-up desk with a conventional desk using the portable stand-up desk kit on a supporting surface (e.g. desk top) of the conventional desk. In another example, the user can form a stand-up desk with, say, a kitchen table top. In any event, the user uses the portable stand-up desk kit to convert a desk or table not normally intended to be used as a stand-up desk to a stand-up desk. Also, after the user has finished with use of the stand-up desk, the kit can be disassembled and the desk returned to conventional use. Furthermore, the kit can be moved to another conventional desk and can be reassembled for use on that desk to form a further stand-up desk. [0006] Preferably, the stand-up desk has a first working surface elevated from the supporting surface (e.g. desk top) and, in some cases, a second working surface elevated from the first working surface. In an example of use of the stand-up desk, the first working surface is used to support a keyboard of a computer and the second working surface is used to support a monitor of the computer so that the monitor and keyboard are at ergonomically desired heights for the user of the stand-up desk. [0007] Specifically, in an embodiment, the interior portion of the kit also includes one or more secondary support means configured to be connected to the first surface at one end of the secondary support means and to be detachably connected to the third surface at the other end. Thus, in the open position, the one or more secondary support means are detachably connected to an underside of the third surface to elevate the third surface from the first working surface to form the second working surface for the stand-up desk. [0008] As described, the kit includes first and second surfaces defining the interior portion when they are parallel and in the closed position. It will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that the interior portion has a depth bound by the first and second surfaces in the closed position. The interior portion is employed by the kit to house the first and secondary support means which are assembled to form the first and second working surfaces of the stand-up desk when the kit is in the open position. For example, the kit is rectangular in shape and the first and second surfaces are bound by a shoulder protruding from the edges of the first and second surfaces so that, when in the closed position, the shoulders define the interior portion of the kit with the first and second surfaces. [0009] In another embodiment, in the closed position, the interior portion includes a third surface contained therein. In this embodiment, the interior portion further includes a secondary support means configured to be detachably connected to the first surface at one end of the secondary support means in the open position and to be connected to the third surface. In the open position, the secondary support means is detachably connected to a side of the first surface with a clamping means disposed on the secondary support means. [0010] It will also be appreciated that the kit can be closed with, say, a latch so that the contents of interior portion are not released inadvertently when, say, moving the kit. Indeed, in an embodiment, the first or the second surface includes a securing means for securing the first surface to the second surface when they are parallel and in the closed position. Nonetheless, it will also be appreciated that the shoulders protruding from the edges of the first and second surfaces on the side of the surface hinging means, for instance two recessed hinges, prevent the first and second surfaces from being rotated beyond being co-planar. [0011] In an embodiment, the first support means includes four legs and each of the legs is connected to adjacent ones of the legs with cross members to support the legs. Specifically, in an embodiment, first and second ones of the legs are connected via a first cross member, third and fourth ones of the legs are connected via a second cross member, the second and fourth ones of the legs are connected via a third cross member, and the first and third ones of the legs are detachably connected via a fourth cross member. It will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that the legs connected to the first, second and third cross members can also be detachably connected using, for example, a suitable interference fit. [0012] In an embodiment, the first cross member is connected to the third cross member and the second cross member is also connected to the third cross member. In the embodiment, the first, second and third cross members are rotatably connected to the underside of the second surface about a support hinging means so that the first, second and third cross members are substantially parallel with the second surface in the closed position and are rotated about the support hinging means to be perpendicular to the second surface in the open position. Accordingly, the first and second legs and the first cross member are substantially parallel with the second surface in the closed position and are rotated about the support hinging means to be perpendicular to the second surface in the open position. The third and fourth legs and the second cross member are also substantially parallel with the second surface in the closed position and are rotated about the support hinging means to be perpendicular to the second surface in the open position. In addition, the second and fourth legs and the third cross member are substantially parallel with the second surface in the closed position and are rotated about the support hinging means to be perpendicular to the second surface in the open position. Thus, in use, a user rotates all the legs forming the first support means from being parallel to the second surface and contained by the interior portion in the closed position of the kit to being perpendicular to the second surface so that the legs can engage the supporting surface once further rotated into position. [0013] The legs are further rotated into position according to the embodiment where the first cross member is rotatably connected to the third cross member about a first cross member hinging means between a parallel position and a perpendicular position. Also, the second cross member is rotatably connected to the third cross member about a second cross member hinging means between the parallel position and the perpendicular position. It will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that the rotation of the cross members relative to each other is in a different plane to the rotation of the cross members relative to the second surface. [0014] In addition, the fourth cross member is rotatably connected to the first surface about a third cross member hinging means so that the fourth cross member is substantially parallel with the first surface in the closed position and is rotated about the third cross member hinging means to be perpendicular to the first surface in the open position. The fourth cross member is also detachably connected to the first and third legs when in the perpendicular position. Accordingly, in the embodiment, the legs are rotated to be located in the corners of a rectangular surface formed by the co-planar first and second surfaces, i.e. the first working surface, so that, in use, the user can then turn the at least partially assembled kit over so that the legs engage the supporting surface and the co-planar first and second surfaces form the first working surface elevated from the supporting surface. [0015] In another embodiment, each of the four legs is rotatably connected to the underside of the first or said second surfaces respectively. In this embodiment, the legs are rotatably connected to the underside of either the first or the second surface respectively about respective support hinging means so that the legs are substantially parallel with the first and second surfaces in the closed position and are rotated about the respective support hinging means to be perpendicular to the first and second surfaces in the open position. Also, each of the respective support hinging means includes a latch to retain the support means (i.e. leg) attached thereto in the closed or the open position. [0016] Preferably, each of the legs include telescopic height adjustment means. As described, the stand-up desk kit enables a user to work in a standing position at a desired and ergonomic height for that user. Accordingly, the user can adjust the height of the first working surface, for say the keyboard, using the telescopic height adjustment means. In one embodiment, the telescopic height adjustment means includes a further latch to frictionally retain a further leg disposed within each of the legs at a selected height along a length of the further leg. [0017] Turning back to the discussion on the second working surface, in one embodiment, the one or more secondary support means are configured to be rotatably connected to the first surface about respective secondary hinging means. The secondary support means are substantially parallel with the first surface in the closed position and are rotated about the respective secondary hinging means to be perpendicular to the first surface in the open position when the third surface is detached from the first surface. That is, in use, a user wishing to assemble an additional, second working surface elevated from the first working surface first detaches the third surface from the first surface and rotates each of the secondary support means to be perpendicular to the first surface so as to support the third surface at an elevation to the first surface. It is envisaged that the second working surface need not be used every time by a user; for example, a user may wish to use a laptop on the first working surface only in some instances. [0018] In any case, the second working surface is assembled according to the embodiment where the secondary support means includes four secondary cross members detachably connected to adjacent ones of the secondary cross members when rotated to be perpendicular to the first surface. For example, the four secondary cross members are detachably connected to each other with an interlocking fit. Also, in an embodiment, the third surface is detachably connected to at least two of the secondary cross members to form the second working surface for the stand-up desk. In this way, the four secondary cross members are contained in the interior portion of the kit and provide the second working surface when assembled by the user. [0019] In another embodiment of assembling the second working surface, the secondary support means is detachably connected to the first surface. In this case, the secondary support means includes an elongate arm, and the third surface is connected to the elongate arm at one end. Accordingly, in the open position of the kit, the secondary support means is detachably connected to the first surface with a clamping means disposed on the elongate arm. Further, the clamping means is adjustably connected to the elongate arm with a further clamping means so that a height of the third surface relative to the first surface is adjustable along a length of the elongate arm by use of the further clamping means to elevate the third surface from the first working surface to form a second working surface for the stand-up desk. [0020] Preferably, the third surface is rotatably connected to the elongate arm about a third surface hinging means between a closed position (when the third surface is retained within the interior portion of the kit in the closed position) and an open position (when in use). The third surface hinging means is configured to enable the third surface to rotate 270 degrees from the closed position to the open position. Thus, the third surface is parallel with the first and second surfaces in the open position to form the second working surface and is parallel with the elongate arm in the closed position. [0021] In an embodiment, the first and second surfaces include corresponding apertures defining a handle when parallel in the closed position to be used for a user to grasp the kit. As described in the above embodiments, the kit is designed to be portable so that a user can carry the kit with him/her to convert conventional desks to stand-up desks and to return the stand-up desk to a conventional desk when the user is finished.

Detailed Description [0043] According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a portable stand-up desk kit 10 for use on a supporting surface of a conventional desk or a table (not shown in the Figures) to form a stand-up desk with the supporting surface. The portable stand-up desk kit 10, as shown in Figure 1 in assembled form, is used on such a supporting surface to form a stand-up desk having a first working surface 11 elevated from the supporting surface and a second working surface 13 elevated from the first working surface 11. As described, the formed stand-up desk can be used by persons with, for example, back problems where the first working surface 11 is, for example, used for a keyboard of a computer and the second working surface is used for a monitor of the computer. Indeed, Figure 13 shows the embodiment where the assembled portable stand-up desk kit is used with a computer monitor 15. [0044] As shown in Figure 1, the first working surface 11 is parallel to the supporting surface (not shown) and the second working surface 13 is also parallel to the first working surface 11 and the supporting surface. It will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that other configurations are possible such as the first working surface having a slope to assist users wishing to use the stand-up desk for, say, writing. The first working surface 11 is supported on the supporting surface by first supporting means 22 which are discussed below in further detail. It will be appreciated, however, that the first supporting means 22 are adjustable so as to adjust the height and, potentially, slope of the first working surface 11 relative to the supporting surface. For example, the height and configuration of the first supporting means 22 can be arranged to support a sloping “draftsman type" working surface elevated from the supporting surface. [0045] Figure 2 shows an embodiment of the portable stand-up desk kit 10 in a closed position and in a disassembled form. The portable stand-up desk kit 10 has a first surface 12 (shown in Figure 3) and a second surface 14 rotatably connected about a hinging means 16. In the embodiment, the hinging means 16 includes two recessed hinges that are used to hinge the first 12 and second 14 surfaces between the closed and open positions. The first 12 and second 14 surfaces are bound by a first 17 and second 19 shoulders protruding about the edges of the first 12 and second 14 surfaces respectively. These shoulders 17 19 protrude perpendicularly so that the first 12 and second 14 surfaces are co-planar when rotated to the open position about the hinges 16, which are recessed into the shoulders 17 19, as shown more clearly in, say, Figure 4. In the closed position shown in Figures 2 and 3, it can be seen that the first 12 and second 14 surfaces are parallel and spaced apart by the length of the shoulders 17 19 to define an interior portion 18 therebetween. [0046] The first surface 12 also includes a third surface 20 detachably connected thereto with two opposed latches 23 fixed to the first surface 12 that detachably connect the third surface 20 to the first surface 12. The two latches 23 include projecting portions that engage with a corresponding slot on either side of the first surface 12. The projecting portions are biased so that a user wishing to detach the third surface 20 must apply pressure to the projecting portions to enable a hook on the projecting portions to pass through the respective slots. In this way, the third surface 20 cannot be inadvertently detached from the first surface 12 when a user is, for example, moving the kit 10. In addition, the first 12 and second surfaces 14 have corresponding apertures 24 that, when the first and second surfaces are parallel in the closed position, form a handle for a person to grasp the kit 10 and move the kit from, say, desk to desk. That is, the portable stand-up desk kit is able to be conveniently moved to whatever desk the person wishes to convert to a stand-up desk [0047] Figure 4 shows the kit 10 in its first stage of being assembled to form a stand-up desk. That is, in this first stage, a user rotates the first surface 12 relative to the second surface 14 about the hinges 16 so that the first surface 12 and the second surface 14 are co-planar and the first support means 22 are exposed in the interior portion 18 of the portable stand-up desk kit 10. Indeed, before this step, in the embodiment shown in Figures 2 and 3, the kit 10 has a securing means 21 in the form of two latches 21 latching the first surface 12 to the second surface 14 so as to prevent the first 12 and second 14 surfaces from rotating about the hinge 16 when not in use. [0048] The first support means 22 are shown in further detail in Figures 5 to 9. These figures show subsequent steps for a user to assemble the portable stand-up desk kit 10. As described, the first support means 22 are configured to be connected to the underside 25 of the first 12 and second 14 surfaces at one end of the first support means 22 and to engage the supporting surface at the other end when the kit 10 is assembled. In an embodiment, the first support means includes four legs connected to adjacent legs with cross members 26, as shown more clearly in Figures 5 to 9. Specifically, in the embodiment, a first leg 28 is connected to a second leg 30 by a first cross member 32. A third leg 34 is connected to a fourth leg 36 via a second cross member 38 and the second and the fourth leg are connected to each other via a third cross member 40. The first and the third legs are detachably connected to each other via a fourth cross member 42. [0049] In the embodiment, the first cross member 32 is connected to the third cross member 40 about a first cross member hinging means 46 and the second cross member 38 is connected to the third cross member 40 about a second cross member hinging means 48. Thus, the first, second and third cross members can be rotatably connected to the underside 25 of the second surface 14 about a support hinging means 44, shown in Figure 5, so that the first 32, second 38 and third 40 cross members are substantially parallel with the second surface 14 in the closed position and are all rotated about the support hinging means 44 to be perpendicular to the second surface 14 in the open position. The support hinging means 44 can be seen in Figure 5 as three hinges spaced apart to hinge the third cross member 40 to the underside 25 of the second surface 14 and thus hinge the connected first 32 and second 38 cross members and the connected legs 28 30 34 36. That is, the user, after opening the kit 10, rotates all the components of the first support means 22 from parallel to perpendicular so that the legs and cross members of the first support means 22 can be further rotated into the designated position. [0050] In this next step of assembling the stand-up desk kit 10, the first cross member 32 is rotated relative to the third cross member 40 about the first cross member hinging means 46 between a parallel position and a perpendicular position and the second cross member 38 is rotated relative to the second cross member 40 about a second cross member hinging means 48 between the parallel position and the perpendicular position, as shown in Figures 7 to 9. Here, it can be seen that the legs 28 30 34 36 are rotated to be located on the corners of the first working surface 11 formed from the co-planar first 12 and second surfaces 14. [0051] In the next step of assembling the kit 10, the fourth cross member 42 is rotated about a third cross member hinging means 50, as shown in Figure 9, from a position substantially parallel with the first surface 11 in the closed position and is rotated to be perpendicular to the first surface 11 in the open position. The fourth cross member 42 is detachably connected to the first 28 and third 34 legs in the perpendicular position by, for example, latches which interact with suitable projections on the first and third legs or with an interlocking fit so as to provide stability and support to the first working surface 11. The portable stand-up desk kit 10 is then turned around so that the ends of the legs 28, 30, 34 and 36 engage the supporting surface and the first working surface 11 is facing upwards as shown in Figure 10. The legs 28, 30, 34 and 36 shown in say Figure 10 are rectangular in shape and parallel to provide stability to the first working surface 11. Indeed, it can be seen from the assembly process for the first support means 22 shown in Figure 4 to 9 that the legs 28, 30, 34 and 36 of the first support means 22 are rotated from being parallel in the interior portion 18 of the kit 10 to being parallel when forming the support means for the first working surface 11. [0052] As described, the user can also adjust the height of the first working surface 13 using a telescopic height adjustment means 27 located on each of the legs 28, 30, 34 and 36, as shown in Figure 14. Here, it can be seen that each of the telescopic adjustment means 27 have preconfigured adjustment heights to assist the user in obtaining a desired height and, in some cases, orientation of the first working surface 11 relative to the supporting surface. [0053] It can also be seen in Figure 10 that the third surface 20 can be detached from the first surface 12 to form the second working surface 13 shown in Figure 1 via the steps shown in Figures 11 and 12. That is, as mentioned above, the third surface 20 is detached from the first surface 12 to begin the process of assembling the second working surface 13 of the kit 10. The detached second surface 20 exposes the second support means 50 which are configured to be connected to the first surface 12 at one end and to be detachably connected to the third surface 20 at the other end. Specifically, the second support means 50 include four secondary cross members 52 which are detachably connected to adjacent ones of the secondary cross members when rotated to be perpendicular to the first surface. The secondary cross members 52 are rotated about respective secondary hinges 54 and the cross members 52 engage adjacent secondary cross members with, for example, adjacent interlocking fitting projections and grooves. Thus, once the secondary cross members 52 are rotated to be perpendicular and fixed in place, the user can attach the third surface 20 to form the second working surface 13 using suitable projections on two opposed secondary cross members 52 which engage with the above described opposed slots on the third surface 20 in the above described manner. Accordingly, by following these steps, the user can assemble the kit 10 to form the stand-up desk with the supporting surface having the first working surface 11 and the second working surface 13 shown in Figure 1. [0054] Figures 15 to 20 show an alternative embodiment of the kit 10. In this embodiment, the portable stand-up desk kit 10 is also used on a supporting surface of a conventional desk or a table (not shown in the Figures) to form a stand-up desk with the supporting surface. In addition, the portable stand-up desk kit 10, as shown in assembled form in Figure 20, also has a first working surface 11 elevated from the supporting surface (not shown) and a second working surface 13 elevated from the first working surface 11. [0055] Figures 15 and 16 shows an embodiment of the portable stand-up desk kit 10 in a closed position and in a disassembled form. The portable stand-up desk kit 10 of this embodiment also has a first surface 12 and a second surface 14 rotatably connected about a hinging means 16. The hinging means 16 here are two spaced apart hinges disposed at either ends of the first 12 and second 14 surfaces. It is also shown that the first 12 and second 14 surfaces in this embodiment are rectangular in shape. It will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art, however, that other shapes are envisaged, such as square surfaces, and the first and second surface need not be symmetrical. In any case, the first 12 and second 14 surfaces are also bound by first 17 and second 19 shoulders protruding about the edges of the first 12 and second 14 surfaces respectively. In the closed position, it can be seen that the first 12 and second 14 surfaces are parallel and spaced apart by the length of the shoulders 17 19 to define an interior portion 18 therebetween which is shown in Figure 17. [0056] Figure 17 shows the kit 10 of this embodiment in its first stage of being assembled to form a stand-up desk. That is, a user first rotates the first surface 12 relative to the second surface 14 about the hinges 16 so that the first surface 12 and the second surface 14 are co-planar and the first support means 22 are exposed in the interior portion 18 of the portable stand-up desk kit 10. Also exposed is a third surface 56 contained within the interior portion 18 when in the closed position. The third surface 56 is connected to a secondary support means 54 that is detachably connected to the first surface 12 so that the third surface 56, when assembled, can form the second working surface 13 in this embodiment. At this stage of assembly of the kit 10, the third surface 56 is removed from the interior portion 18 by the user for later attachment if required. [0057] That is, in the second stage of assembling the kit 10 of this embodiment to form a stand-up desk, the third surface 56 is removed from the interior portion 25 and the first support means 22 are rotated from the underside 25 of the first 12 and second 14 surfaces from a closed position to an open position. It can be seen that the first support means 22 in this embodiment includes four legs disposed at the distal corners of the first 12 and second 14 surfaces. The legs 22 are rotatably connected to the underside 25 of the first 12 or second 14 surfaces with a support hinging means (not shown) so that they are rotated 90 degrees from being substantially parallel with the first 12 and second 14 surfaces in the closed position to being substantially perpendicular in the open position. In addition, each of the respective support hinging means include a latch 68 to retain the legs attached thereto in either the closed position (parallel to the first 12 or second 14 surface) or the open position (perpendicular to the first 12 or second 14 surface). The latch 68 includes a lever 69 which can be moved by the user to be retained in either a first groove 71 when a leg 22 is to be held in the closed position or in a second groove 73 when the leg 22 is to be held in the open position. [0058] With the legs 22 rotated to perpendicular and held in position by the respect latches 68, the portable stand-up desk kit 10 is then turned around so that the ends of the legs 22 engage the supporting surface. The first working surface 11, elevated from the supporting desk by the length of the legs 22, is thus formed from the co-planar first 12 and second 14 surfaces and is facing upwards, as shown in Figure 18. [0059] Next, if a second working surface 13 is desired, the third surface 56 is then attached to the first working surface 11 with a clamping means 60, as shown in Figure 19. The third surface 56 is connected to a secondary support means 54 which is detachably connected to the first surface 12 with the clamping means 60 disposed on the secondary support means 54. The clamping means 60 includes an upper clamping surface 64 and a lower clamping surface 66 configured to grasp an upper and lower surface of the first surface 12 and to be retained thereto by action of the clamping means 60. It will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that, while the third surface 56 is shown as being attached to the first surface 12, it can also be attached to the second surface 14 in the same way. [0060] The secondary support means 54 includes an elongate arm 58 and the third surface 56 is connected to the elongate arm 58 at one end and the clamping means 60 is adjustably connected to the elongate arm 58 with a further clamping means 62 so that a height of the third surface 56 relative to the first surface 12 is adjustable along a length of the elongate arm 58 by use of the further clamping means 62. In this way, a user can elevate the third surface 56 from the first working surface 11 to form a second working surface 13 for the stand-up desk at a desired height. Also, it will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that the clamping means 60 and the further clamping means 62 could be configured as a single clamping means performing the two different clamping functions simultaneously. [0061] In addition, the third surface 56 is rotatably connected to the elongate arm 58 about a third surface hinging means 61 between a closed position and an open position, whereby the third surface 56 is in the closed position when contained within the interior portion 25 and in the open position with in use. In this embodiment, the third surface hinging means 61 is configured to enable the third surface 56 to rotate 270 degrees from the closed position to the open position so that the third surface 56 defining the second working surface 13 is parallel with the first 12 and second 14 surfaces defining the first working surface 11 in the open position. [0062] As described, the user can also adjust the height of the first working surface 13 relative to the height of the supporting desk using a telescopic height adjustment means 27 located on each of the legs. In this embodiment, the telescopic adjustment means 27 includes a further latch 70 to, for instance, frictionally retain a further leg disposed within each of the legs at a selected height along a length of the further leg. [0063] Accordingly, by following these steps, the user can also assemble the kit 10 to form the stand-up desk with the supporting surface having the first working surface 11 and the second working surface 13 shown in Figure 20. [0064] It is to be understood that various alterations, addition and/or modifications may be made to the parts specifically described without departing from the ambit of the present invention. [0065] It will be appreciated that the above description of the prior art has been provided merely as background to explain the content of the invention. It is not to be taken as an admission that any of the material referred to as published or known forms part of the common general knowledge in Australia or elsewhere. 1.
