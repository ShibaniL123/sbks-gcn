ΐ PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF TUMOURS THAT EXPRESS EGFR AND GANGLIOSIDE N-GLYCOLYL GM3 (NeuGcGM3) TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to the field of human medicine, particularly to the treatment of tumors that overexpress EGFR and A/-glycolyl ganglioside (NeuGcGM3). PREVIOUS ART Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of the molecular targets most used in current clinical evaluation. This molecule is overexpressed in a variety of human epithelial tissues (Yarden, Υ., and Sliwkowski Μ. Χ., Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001, 2: 127-137). Two treatments are most often used in therapies to inhibit the function of EGF receptor: neutralization of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and the small molecules that inhibit tyrosine kinase activity (TKI, tyrosine quinasa inhibitor) (Ciardiello, F., and Tortora G., Ν. Engl. J. Med. 2008, 358: 1160-1174). Although it also has been demonstrated that a vaccine with the extracellular domain of EGFR when using the very small size particle (VSSP) as adjuvant generated an antimetastatic effect in the murine model of Lewis lung carcinoma (Sanchez Ramirez Β., et al, Int. J. Cancer. 2006, 119: 2190-2199). Treatment with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies mediate tumor regression by the interruption of oncogenic signals and the induction of an innate immune response mechanism mediated by the Fc receptor (Martinelli, Ε., et al, Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2009,158: 1-9). Several human monoclonal antibodies against EGFR have been generated including: Cetuximab (Garrett CR, and Eng C., Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2011; 11:7, 937-49) and Nimotuzumab (Mateo C, Immunotechnology 1997; 3:71-81). The antitumor effect of Nimotuzumab in the therapy of different tumors that overexpress the EGFR has been described (Crombet Τ, et al, Cancer Biol Therapy. 2006, 5:375-379) or in combination with other therapies (Crombet Τ, et al, J Clin Oncol. 2004, 22:1646-1654; Zhao KL, et al, Invest New Drugs. 2011 Pre published online September 8). On the other hand, the 7Α7 MAb generated against murine EGFR demonstrated antitumor effect mediated by Τ cells in the treatment of Lewis lung carcinoma (Garrido G., et al, Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2007, 56: 1701-1710). Another of the most studied targets is gangliosides, which are glycosphingolipids that contain sialic acid in their structure. These molecules are present in normal tissues and over-expressed in tumor tissues (Zhang S, et al. Int J Cancer 73:42-49, 1997). There are two forms of sialic acid: Νacetylated and N-glycolylated, the latter described in human tumors (Malykh Υ Ν., et al, Biochimie. 2001, 83:7 623-634), both as gangliosides (Kawai Τ. et al, 1991 Cancer. Res. (51) 1242-1246) and N-glycolylated glycoproteins (Devine P.L., et al, Cancer Research, 1991, 51: 21, 5826-5836). For this reason these molecules have been identified in many malignant tumors making them attractive targets for cancer therapy. Particularly, NeuGcGM3 ganglioside is specifically recognized by 14F7 MAb (Carr A. et al, Flybridoma, 2000, 19: 3, 241-247). This ganglioside has been identified in different tumors by various methods (Blanco R., et al, ISRN Pathology. 2011, Article ID 953803, 10 pag., Marquina et al, Cancer Research. 1996, 56: 22, 5165-5171) Active immunotherapy against NeuGcGM3 in tumors has been published using NeuGcGM3/VSSP molecular vaccine (Estevez F., et al, Vaccine. 1999, 18:190-197) which has demonstrated its immunogenicity and its safety in advanced breast cancer patients (Carr A., et al, JCO. 2003, 21:1015-1021). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in the preclinical stage that its potent antitumor effect (anti-metastatic), is mediated by a mechanism of cellular response of ΝΚ and CD8+ cells (Labrada Μ., et al, Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2010, 10:2,153-162). At the same time, an anti-tumor effect has been generated in patients with non small cell lung cancer immunized with the anti-idiotypic vaccine (1Ε10 anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody, Racotumumab, which mimics N-glycolylated gangliosides (Alfonso S., et al, Cancer Biology & Therapy. 2007, 6:12, 1847- 1852). Published results with this vaccine show its immunogenicity and safety (Alfonso Μ., et al, Journal of Immunology. 2002, 168: 2523-2529). The EGFR in membrane microdomains plays an essential role in controlling the growth of tumor cells. It has been demonstrated that GM3 ganglioside inhibits EGFR-dependent proliferation in a great variety of cell lines, both in vivo and in vitro. GM3 inhibits EGFR kinase activity (EGFR autophosphorylation). GM3 ganglioside inhibits the autophosphorylation of the kinase domain of EGFR. GM3 has the potential capacity of allosterically regulate structural transition of the inactive form to signaling by the EGFR dimer in order to prevent the autophosphorylation of the kinase intracellular domain to the ligand binding site (Coskun LI., et al, PNAS. 2011, 108: 22, 9044-9048). Changes in the composition of gangliosides in the membrane are important in the regulation of the EGFR signal transduction (Zurita AR., et al, Biochem. J. 2001,35: 465-472). Promising results are expected in the medical practice of simultaneous or alternate anti-tumor therapies (Takeda Κ. et al, Cancer Sci., 2007; 98: 9, 1297-1302). But not all schemes of applying anti-tumor therapies give positive and synergistic results in practice. In a Phase III clinical study in metastatic colorectal cancer, where the anti-EGFR MAb (Cetuximab) and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor MAb (Bevacizumab) were used, together with a potent chemotherapeutic drug regimen there was a worsening of the evolution of cancer, which also caused serious adverse events as compared with patients who received Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy only (Tol J., et al, Ν Engl J Med. 2009; 360:6,563-72). The successful implementation of various therapies in a patient is the result of the specific functional relationships between selected targets for these therapies, tumor localization, as well as the nature of the therapies applied in each case (antibodies, vaccines or others). Today there is evidence in the literature of a structural and functional relationship between gangliosides and EGFR in tumor cells. Flowever, the practical implication of this relationship in the successful application in the same patient of therapies against EGFR and gangliosides targets has not been addressed either in clinical or preclinical studies. The novelty of the present invention lies in the preclinical and clinical demonstration for the first time of the synergistic potentiation of the antitumor activity derived from applying anti-EGFR therapies and anti-NeuGcGM3 vaccines, in tumors co-expressing these targets.

The therapy scheme can be administered in a time period from approximately 1 to 5 years. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent directed to EGFR and the NeuGcGM3 vaccine or anti-idiotypic vaccine are administered simultaneously. The therapeutic agent directed to EGFR and NeuGcGM3 vaccine or anti-idiotype vaccine are sometimes used at the same time on the subject. In some embodiments the NeuGcGM3 anti-ganglioside therapy can be administered by: subcutaneous, intravenous, intradermal, intramuscular or intraperitoneal injections, while the anti-EGFR therapy can be administered by subcutaneous, intravenous, or intramuscular routes. In other embodiments the administration site is determined by the presence of afferent lymph nodes. In another embodiment, during the application of therapies, certain biochemical and imaging parameters of patients are recorded. Cellular and humoral immunity is preferably analyzed using the blood of patients. Blood tests are performed at a frequency ranging from weekly to every six months. "Co-expression" as used in the present invention means that both targets are expressed but may or may not have a close structural relationship, the operational criterium for this definition is by determination of EGFR and Νglycolylated ganglioside (NeuGcGM3) expression by double staining, using a fluorescent microscope and a processor that allow the superposition of images. "Co-localization" as used in the present invention refers to both targets being structurally close, the operational criterium for this determination is by definition of EGFR and A/-glycolylated ganglioside (NeuGcGM3) expression by double staining using a confocal microscope. In a further embodiment the present invention encompasses the use of a compound against EGFR and a compound against NeuGcGM3 ganglioside, for the preparation of a medicament for retarding tumor growth in a patient according to the treatment regimen that involves: (a) first administering to the patient the medicament comprising the compound against the EGF receptor and, (b) subsequently administering to the same patient the medicament comprising the compound against NeuGcGM3 ganglioside.

In a particular embodiment the present invention encompasses a kit of reagents for therapy of tumors which co-express EGFR and NeuGcGM3 ganglioside targets, said kit comprises the simultaneous, staggered or alternate administration of a compound against EGFR and another compound against NeuGcGM3 ganglioside. Determination of co-expression of EGFR and A/-qlvcolvlated ganglioside (NeuGcGM3) in human tumors of different localizations. Measuring the expression of EGFR and NeuGcGM3 therapeutic targets in tumors can be performed using any of the methods described in the art for such purposes. Such measurement is performed in tumors of different localizations and origin, on tumor samples previously fixed in formol or on fresh tissue slices. In a preferred embodiment, the detection is performed by employing immunological techniques for EGFR and the GM3 N-glycolated variant recognition. Particularly immunohistochemistry and brightfield microscopy can be used separately for immunorecognition of both molecules or immunofluorescence and fluorescence microscopy to determine the co-expression or the immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy to determine the co-localization. In preferred embodiments of the present invention the EGFR can be detected using ior egf/R3m MAb (5-20pg/ml), described in the ΕΡ 0586002Β1 and NeuGcGM3 can be detected using 14F7 MAb (5-25pg/ml), described in the US 6,429,295 or ΕΡ 0972782Β1. In one embodiment of the present invention, for immunorecognition by separate of both molecules (Simple staining) Dako, LSABr Peroxidase System, DAB (Dako, Carpinteria, California, USA) can be used as detection system. Given that the EGFR is located on the cytoplasmic membrane of tumor cells while the GM3 A/-glycolyl is located in the membrane and intracytoplasmic, immunorecognition is deemed to be positive when the intensity of the reaction is equal or larger 20% positivity. In a preferred embodiment, the co-expression of both molecules can be detected using a double staining technique and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy, only in those tumor samples where immunorecognition was previously positive for both molecules separately. While the co-localization of both molecules can be detected by using a double staining technique and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. In a preferred embodiment immunorecognition of the EGFR is performed by incubation with lor egf/R3m mAb (5-20pg/ml) for 1 hr, followed by an IgG antibody conjugated to rhodamine (Dako, Carpinteria, California, USA). In another preferred embodiment, NeuGcGM3 immunodetection is performed using biotinylated 14F7 mAb (5-20pg/ml), 30 min. Followed by FITC-conjugated streptavidin (Dako, Carpinteria, California, USA). The following examples illustrate a preferred embodiment of the present invention and therefore serve to illustrate it but in no case should they be considered as a limitation.

EXAMPLES Example 1: Measuring EGFR and NeuGcGM3 ganglioside coexpression in different human tumors. The tumor samples were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and processed by paraffin inclusion technique, which is known to those skilled in the art. The tissue sections obtained which had a thickness of 5 microns were maintained at 60°C for 30 min, deparaffinized and rehydrated in a series of decreasing alcohols, kept in distilled water for 10 minutes and washed with TBS for 5 minutes. The reactivity of total tissue protein was blocked with a commercially available solution (Dako, Carpinteria, California, USA) for 30 min. The EGFR was immunodetected using the ior egf/R3m (20pg/ml) for 1 hr. The immunorecognition of NeuGcGM3 was performed using 14F7 (MAb 20pg/ml) for 30 min. After reaction of the primary antibodies, in both cases, the detection system used was Dako, LSABR Peroxidase System, DAB (Dako, Carpinteria, California, USA). Tissue sections were dehydrated and Mayer's hematoxylin contrast was used (Dako, Carpinteria, California, USA). The negative control was obtained by substituting the primary antibody (lor egf/R3m MAb or 14F7 MAb) by TBS wash solution (1Χ) and breast ductal carcinoma was used as a positive control. The immunorecognition of the EGFR was located on the cytoplasmic membrane of tumor cells and the NeuGcGM3 ganglioside was detected intracytoplasmic and/or in the cytoplasmic membrane of cells. Double staining: The EGFR was detected with lor egf/R3m MAb (anti-EGFR) and then incubated with FITC-conjugated streptavidin (Dako, Carpinteria, California, USA). NeuGcGM3 was detected with biotinylated 14F7 MAb and subsequently with anti-murine IgG antibody conjugated to rhodamine (Dako, Carpinteria, California, USA). Co-expression of both molecules in tumor cells were identified in yellow in the images. Tissue sections were digitized and analyzed using a camera attached to an Olympus ΒΧ51 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan). For the analysis of the digitized images ImageJ image processor version 1.43u was used. Table 1 shows tumors from different localizations wherein EGFR and NeuGcGM3 ganglioside are co-expressed.

Coexpression and co-localization measurement of EGFR and NeuGcGM3 aanglioside in murine tumor models Murine tumor models used were Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL-D122), and Myeloma P3-X63-Ag8.653 (Χ63). Double staining was performed to determine the co-expression/co-localization. The immunorecognition of EGFR was performed by incubation with 7Α7 MAb (20pg/ml), biotinylated, for 1 hr, followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated Streptavidin (Dako, Carpinteria, California, USA). Immunostaining of NeuGcGM3 was determined by incubation with 14F7 MAb (20pg/ml), for 30 min, followed by incubation with an anti-murine IgG antibody conjugated to rhodamine (Dako, Carpinteria, California, USA). The negative control was obtained by replacing the primary antibody (7Α7 MAb or 14F7 MAb) by TBS wash solution (1Χ). The co-expression was determined by using an Olympus ΒΧ51 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan) and analysis of the digitized images using ImageJ image processor version 1.43u. The co-localization was determined by confocal laser microscope Flouview FV500 (Olympus, Japan). Figure 1 shows the co-localization of EGFR and NeuGcGM3 in tumor samples from various murine models. The EGFR was identified with biotinylated 7Α7 MAb followed by FITC-coupled streptavidin. The yellow color identifies the co-localization (C and F) of both molecules in tumor cells of murine models by color overlay. Example 3. Measurement of survival of C57BL/6 mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma treated with NeuGcGM3/VSSP vaccine and 7Α7 mAb. Spontaneous metastasis model. The animals were inoculated in the right footpad with 2x105 cells of Lewis epidermoid carcinoma (3LL-D122), in a volume of 0.05 ml, which corresponded to day 0 of the experimental protocol. On day 3 of the experiment the animals were randomized into four experimental groups of 10 animals each. On day 24, when the tumor reached a volume of 8-9 mm primary tumor surgery was performed. From day 48, observation of the clinical status of the animals began, Survival data were analyzed using the Log-rank test, ρ <0.05, and displayed on a Kaplan-Meier plot. The result includes three experiments performed on equal conditions. Experimental groups Untreated control. (Τ) Passive anti-EGFR therapy: 7Α7 MAb, intravenously at a dose of 56pg in 200μ1 of Saline Solution, on days 3, 5, 7, 9, 31,33 and 35. Active anti-NeuGcGM3 therapy: NeuGcGM3/VSSP vaccine, subcutaneously at a dose of 200 pg in 200 μΐ, on days 7, 21,35 and 47. Simultaneous administration of anti-EGFR and anti-NeuGcGM3 therapies as described for groups 2 and 3. Figure 2a shows that the simultaneous administration of anti-EGFR and anti-NeuGcGM3 (group 4) therapies on the lung metastasis model induced with Lewis lung carcinoma, increased survival of the animals by 60% compared with the other experimental groups. Surviving animals (one in group 4) were sacrificed one week after the end of the experiment and their lungs were removed. Macroscopic analysis showed that only one animal showed two lung metastases, noticing also that the rest the lungs of the animals were normal. (Figure 2b). This result demonstrates a strong synergy of antitumor activity of anti-EGFR and anti-NeuGcGM3 therapies studied in this murine tumor model wherein EGFR and NeuGcGM3 are co-localizated (see Example 2) Example 4. Measurement of survival of cancer patients undergoing therapy with Nimotuzumab antibody and Racotumumab/Alumina vaccine. Given the finding on the frequent co-localization/co-expression of therapeutic targets EGFR and NeuGcGM3 ganglioside in samples of human lung tumor (Example 1); and the preclinical evidence shown in Example 3, we proceeded to study simultaneous treatment with anti-EGFR (Nimotuzumab antibody) and anti-ganglioside (Racotumumab/Alumina anti-idiotypic vaccine) therapies in lung cancer patients who had received the standard therapy for each tumor site and who had already disease progression. Table 2 shows the test results from expanded use program (compassionate) of Racotumomab (1Ε10/Alumina) vaccine as single therapy or in combination with Nimotuzumab. Survival of cancer patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in advanced stages (Recurrent and/or Metastatic) is observed on it. It should be noted that patients on this study had received all established standard treatment lines and were only candidates for palliative, non onco-specific, therapy and that at the time of inclusion in the trial they had disease progression. In the group of patients that received therapy simultaneously against both targets a significant increase in overall survival at two years of treatment was observed, as compared with those who received only the monotherapies. Table 2. Increased survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with anti-EGFR (Nimotuzumab antibody) and anti-ganglioside (Racotumumab/Alumina anti-idiotypic vaccine) therapies at two years of treatment.

Figure 3Α shows the localization and extent of the tumor at the time of diagnosis. Figure 3Β shows the results from Computed Tomography (CT) at two years after treatment. In the latter figure only areas of fibroblastic response with areas of increased transparency in relation with bullae of emphysema that can be seen and no lung tumor lesion is observed. The same radiographic image remains three years later. This result indicates a surprising complete remission of a very advanced tumor as a result of therapy. Example 5. Measurement of clinical response in a patient with retroperitoneal-peripancreatic hemangiopericytoma treated with the Nimotuzumab antibody and NeuGcGM3/VSSP vaccine. Figure 4 shows a sequential computed tomography of the abdomen of a patient with retroperitoneal-peripancreatic hemangiopericytoma (soft tissue tumor), with no response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The patient received anti-EGFR (Nimotuzumab) and anti-ganglioside (NeuGcGM3/VSSP vaccine) therapies 18 months after the initial diagnosis. The patient had severe pain and a throbbing tumor mass in the periumbilical region and weight loss of more than 15 kilos. Figures 4 A and Β correspond to the start time of therapies; C and D correspond to the evaluation after three years. Three years after application of treatment a stabilization of the disease can be observed, as evidenced by both images wherein the tumor size remains the same. Moreover, in the 72-month evaluation, patient maintains an excellent quality of life and is able to continue his working life. A tendency towards reduction of the tumor mass can also be seen. In summary, there is a surprising clinical benefit as response to the treatment. Cancer patients treated with anti-EGFR and anti-ganglioside immunotherapy, as described in this invention, exhibit excellent tolerance (no significant toxicity) for long periods of treatment. The therapy promotes stabilization of the disease, increasing the quality of life, time to progression and overall survival of patients. The therapy described above has a superior effect to that observed in patients receiving traditional anti-EGFR or anti-ganglioside monotherapies. The discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like is included in this specification solely for the purpose of providing a context for the present invention.
