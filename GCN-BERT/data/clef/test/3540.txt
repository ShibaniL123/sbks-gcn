TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates generally to organometallic olefin metathesis catalysts, and more particularly to the in-situ formation of such olefin metathesis catalysts, as well as the use of such catalysts in metathesis reactions of olefins and olefin compounds. The invention has utility in the fields of catalysis, organic synthesis, polymer chemistry, and industrial and fine chemicals chemistry. BACKGROUND Olefin metathesis has become an exceptionally powerful and applicable method for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds in organic and polymer synthesis. Ruthenium-based complexes (1-3) are the most commonly employed olefin metathesis catalysts in academic and industrial laboratories, because they can be handled in air and are tolerant of various organic functional groups. (see (a) Schrodi, Y.; Pederson, R. L. Aldrichim. Acta 2007, 40, 45-52. (b) Grubbs, R. H. Adv. Synth. Catal. 2007, 349, 34-40). However, the syntheses of these complexes are relatively cumbersome, usually involving more than one step and requiring isolation of the catalysts to remove catalyst-inhibiting by-products such as liberated phosphine ligands (Scheme 1). (see, e.g., (a) Schwab, P.; Grubbs, R. H.; Ziller, J. W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 100-110. (b) Scholl, M.; Ding, S.; Lee, C. W.; Grubbs, R. H. Org. Lett. 1999, 1, 953-956. (c) Chatterjee, A.

Org. Chem. 2000, 65, 2204-2207. (h) Monsaert, S.; Drozdzak, R.; Dragutan, V.; Dragutan, I.; Verpoort, F., Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2008, 432-440). Therefore, a one-step procedure that forms highly active olefin metathesis catalysts and does not require purification or isolation would provide certain advantages. Ideally, the new procedure should be as atom-economic as possible. In particular, a new method that requires only one equivalent of expensive ligands (e.g., PCy3) per ruthenium center would be desirable. Previous attempts to generate olefin metathesis catalysts in situ focused on the preparation of ruthenium vinylidene (see (a) Katayama, H.; Ozawa, F., Coord. Chem. Rev. 2004, 248, 1703-1715. (b) Katayama, H.; Ozawa, F., Organometallics 1998, 17, 5190-5196. (c) Louie, J.; Grubbs, R. H., Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2001, 40, 247-249.) and allenylidene species (see (a) Dragutan, I.; Dragutan, V., Platinum Met. Rev. 2006, 50, 81-94. (b) Fürstner, A.; Liebl, M.; Lehmann, C. W.; Picquet, M.; Kunz, R.; Bruneau, C.; Touchard, D.; Dixneuf, P. H., Chem.-Eur. J. 2000, 6, 1847-1857. (c) Schanz, H.-J.; Jafarpour, L.; Stevens, E. D.; Nolan, S. P., Organometallics 1999, 18, 5187-5190). However, these types of complexes proved less active in olefin metathesis than their ruthenium-alkylidene counterparts. For example, ruthenium allenylidene complex 4 can be very conveniently prepared in a one-step procedure involving the treatment of [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 with 1,1-diphenylprop-2-yn-1-ol in the presence of two equivalents of PCy3 (Scheme 2). (See Schanz, H.-J.; Jafarpour, L.; Stevens, E. D.; Nolan, S. P., Organometallics 1999, 18, 5187-5190). Unfortunately, 4 is inactive in olefin metathesis although its chemical isomer-ruthenium-indenylidene complex 3a-shows good activity. (See; and Schanz, H.-J.; Jafarpour, L.; Stevens, E. D.; Nolan, S. P., Organometallics 1999, 18, 5187-5190). Recently the Schrodi and Bruneau groups have published interesting chelating indenylidene catalysts. (See Jimenez, L. R.; Gallon, B. J.; Schrodi, Y. Organometallics 2010, 29, 3471-3473, incorporated herein by reference, and Kabro, A.; Roisnel, T.; Fischmeister, C.; Bruneau, C. Chem.-Eur. J. 2010, 16, 12255-12261). Despite the advances achieved in the preparation of olefin metathesis catalysts, a continuing need exists for new synthetic methods for preparing such catalysts. Of particular interest are methods that provide techniques for the preparation of new catalysts, while also providing for better utilization of reactants and improved product yields. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE Accordingly, the invention is directed to addressing one or more of the aforementioned concerns, and, in one embodiment, provides a method for preparing an organometallic compound, such as an olefin metathesis catalyst, by contacting a precursor compound with an acetylenic compound comprising a chelating moiety, optionally in the presence of a neutral electron donor.

Example 1a Synthesis of 3,5-diisopropoxybenzophenone 3,5-Diisopropoxybenzophenone was prepared from 3,5-diisopropoxybenzonitrile following a procedure analogous to that described above for the preparation of 3,5-dimethoxybenzophenone (Example 1). 3,5-Diisopropoxybenzonitrile was synthesized according to a literature procedure (Wang, E.-C.; Lin, G.-J. A New One Pot Method for the Conversion of Aldehydes into Nitriles Using Hydroxyamine and Phthalic Anhydride. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 4047-4050). Example 2 Synthesis of 1-(3,5-Dimethoxyphenyl)-1-Phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol The following method was adapted from a literature procedure.vii Anhydrous THF (50 mL) was cooled to −78° C. Purified acetylene gas was gently bubbled through the THF for 1 hour. A 2.5M solution of n-butyllithium in THF (8.2 mL, 20.5 mmol) was then added drop-wise and the mixture was stirred vigorously for 20 minutes. 3,5-Dimethoxybenzophenone (5.0 g, 20.5 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of anhydrous THF and the solution was slowly dropped into the reaction flask.

Example 2a Synthesis of 1-(3,5-Diisopropoxyphenyl)-1-Phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol 1-(3,5-Diisopropoxyphenyl)-1-Phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol was prepared in an analogous procedure according to Example 2 using 3,5-diisopropoxybenzophenone in place of 3,5-dimethoxybenzophenone. Example 3 Synthesis of 13C2-Labeled 1-(3,5-Dimethoxyphenyl)-1-Phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol A dry 100 mL reaction flask equipped with a stir bar was charged with anhydrous THF (20 mL) inside the glove box, capped with a septum, and taken out of the glove box. The THF was then frozen in a liquid N2 bath and evacuated before doubly labeled acetylene 13C2H2 (0.5 L, 20.4 mmoles) was transferred into the reaction flask via the vacuum line. The flask was filled with Ar and warmed to −78° C. in an acetone/dry ice bath. A 2.5M solution of n-butyl lithium in hexanes (4.1 mL, 10.2 mmoles) was added dropwise under stirring and the reaction mixture was stirred for 20 minutes at −78° C. A suspension of 3,5-dimethoxybenzophenone (2.49 g, 10.2 mmol) in 5 mL of anhydrous THF was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 30 minutes. The solution was then allowed to slowly warm up to room temperature and the reaction was worked up in a manner analogous to the procedure for the preparation of 1-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol. 13C2-1-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol was obtained as a faint-yellow crystalline material in 89% yield. 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 7.62 (d, 3JH-H=7.2 Hz, 2H), 7.33 (t, 3JH-H=6.4 Hz, 2H), 7.29 (d, 3JH-H=7.2 Hz, 1H), 6.79 (d, 3JH-H=2.4 Hz, 2H), 6.37 (t, 3JH-H=2.4 Hz, 2H), 3.75 (s, 6H), 2.85 (dd, 1JC-H=250.4 Hz, 2JC-H=50.0 Hz, 1H), protons from OH group not observed. 13C{1H} NMR (CDCl3): δ 160.68, 128.39, 127.99, 126.03, 104.60, 99.84, 86.45 (d, 1JC-C=171 Hz, C2), 75.56 (d, 1JC-C=172 Hz, C1), 55.46. Example 4 In-Situ Preparations of Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Using 1-(3,5-Dimethoxyphenyl)-1-Phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol Method 1: A small conical vial equipped with a spin vane was charged with RuCl2(p-cymene)(PCy3) (50 mg, 0.085 mmol) and 1-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol (5) (25 mg, 0.094 mmol, 1.1 equiv). THF was added to reach a total volume of 1.0 mL of dark orange solution. The vial was sealed, removed from the glove box, and heated at 70° C. under stirring for 16 hours. The dark brown solution was used as is to catalyze ring-closing metathesis (RCM) reactions (see below). The dark brown solution features two main phosphorus-containing species in a ˜5/1 ratio according to 31P NMR spectroscopy. Major species: 31P{1H} NMR (THF-d8): δ 48.6 (s). Minor species: 31P{1H} NMR (THF-d8): δ 68.1 (s). According to Method 1, Schema 3(a), 1-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol (5) was reacted with RuCl2(p-cymene)(PCy3) (Method 1; Scheme 3a) or with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 in the presence of one equivalent of PCy3 (Method 2; Scheme 3b) to yield ruthenium-indenylidene complex 6 as a major product, according to NMR spectroscopy. The resulting dark-brown solution was subsequently used without any further treatment to promote the ring-closing metathesis (RCM) of diethyl diallylmalonate (eq 2). The in-situ catalyst proved as effective in this RCM as highly active 2a under standard conditions regardless of which method was used to generate it (FIG. 1). Method 2: A small conical vial equipped with a spin vane was charged with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (52 mg, 0.085 mmol), 1-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol (5) (55 mg, 0.206 mmol, 1.2 equiv/Ru), and tricyclohexylphosphine (48 mg, 0.17 mmol, 1.0 equiv/Ru). THF was added to reach a total volume of 2.0 mL of dark orange suspension. The vial was sealed, removed from the glove box, and heated at 70° C. under stirring for 16 hours. The dark brown solution was used as is to catalyze RCM reactions (see below). 31P NMR spectroscopy reveals that this solution contains the same species in the same ratio as what was obtained with method 1. Method 3: A small conical vial equipped with a spin vane was charged with RuCl2(PPh3)3 (165 mg, 0.17 mmol), 1-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol (5) (55 mg, 0.206 mmol, 1.2 equiv/Ru). THF was added to reach a total volume of 2.0 mL of dark orange suspension. The vial was sealed, removed from the glove box, and heated at 70° C. under stirring for 3 hours. Tricyclohexyl-phosphine (48 mg, 0.17 mmol, 1.0 equiv/Ru) was then added at room temperature and the mixture was allowed to stir for 1 h. 31P NMR spectroscopy reveals that this solution contains complex 6 as a major species. Example 4a In-Situ Preparations of Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Using 1-(3,5-Diisopropoxyphenyl)-1-Phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol An analogous procedure according to Method 1, Schema 3a), of Example 4 was used in which 1-(3,5-diisopropoxyphenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol (7) was reacted with RuCl2(p-cymene)(PCy3) (see Method 1; Scheme 3a) to yield ruthenium-indenylidene complex 8. According to Method 1, Scheme 3(a), a J-Young NMR tube was charged with a solution of RuCl2(p-cymene)(PCy3) (15 mg, 0.026 mmol) and 1-(3,5-diisopropoxyphenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol (7, 14 mg, 0.043 mmol, 1.65 equiv) in THF-d8 (400 μL). The NMR tube was sealed, removed from the glove box, and heated at 70° C. for 10 hours to give 8 as a major species. The orange brown solution was used as is to catalyze ring-closing metathesis (RCM) reactions (see below). The orange brown solution features two main phosphorus-containing species according to 31P NMR spectroscopy: Major organometallic species 8 (>90%): 31P{1H} NMR (THF-d8): δ 68.0 (s). Minor organometallic species (<10%): 31P{1H} NMR (THF-d8): δ 48.6 (s). Example 5 In-Situ Preparations of Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Using 13C2-Labelled 1-(3,5-Dimethoxyphenyl)-1-Phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol A solution of 13C-labeled catalyst was prepared by method 1 (see above) using the 13C-labelled 1-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol (13C2-5). This solution contains the same major and minor species as described above according to 31P NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the 13C and 31P NMR data are consistent with a mono-phosphine ruthenium indenylidene structure (6) for the major species. Indeed, the shifts in the 13C NMR spectrum for the Cα and the Cβ are consistent with an indenylidene fragment as opposed to an allenylidene one.viii Additionally, the splitting (doublet of doublet) of the resonance corresponding to the Cα of the major species indicates that only one phosphine ligand is attached to the ruthenium. Major species: 13C{1H} NMR (THF-d8): δ 287.0 ppm (dd, 2JCα-P=11 Hz, 1JCα-Cβ=49 Hz, Ca), 129.2 ppm (d, 1JCα-Cβ=51 Hz, Cβ). 31P{1H} NMR (THF-d8): δ 48.6 (d, 2JP-Cβ=11 Hz). Minor species: 13C{1H} NMR (THF-d8): δ 256.2 ppm (dd, 2JCα-P=15 Hz, 1JCα-Cβ=48 Hz, Ca), 138.2 ppm (d, 1JCα-Cβ=49 Hz, Cβ). 31P{1H} NMR (THF-d8): δ 68.1 (d, 2JCα-Cβ=15 Hz). Example 6 Procedure for Activity Plots of the RCM of Diethyl Diallylmalonate at 30° C.ix A solution of the olefin metathesis catalyst—prepared by method 1 or method 2 as described above—(0.085M, 6 μL, 0.51 μmol) and CD2Cl2 (480 μL) were transferred to an NMR tube equipped with a screw-cap septum top. The sample was equilibrated at 30° C. in the NMR probe before diethyl diallylmalonate (12 μL, 12 mg, 50 μmol, 0.1M) was added via syringe. Data points were collected over a period of 1 hour. The conversion to the RCM product was determined by comparing the ratio of the integrals of the methylene protons in the substrate material, δ2.61 (dt), with those in the product, δ2.98 (s). Example 7 Synthesis Procedure for the RCM of Diethyl Diallylmalonate Using Catalyst 6 at 40° C. A 0.1M stock solution of diethyl diallylmalonate in CD2Cl2 was prepared by dissolving diethyl diallylmalonate (60 mg, 0.25 mmol) in 2.44 mL of CD2Cl2. A portion of this stock solution (0.5 mL, 50 μmol of diethyl diallylmalonate) was transferred to an NMR tube equipped with a screw-cap septum top. A solution of the olefin metathesis catalyst—prepared by method 1 or method 2 as described above—(0.085M, 6 μL, 0.51 μmol, 1.0 mol %) was added to the diethyl diallylmalonate solution via syringe. The NMR tube was then capped and placed in an oil bath regulated at 40° C. and the reaction mixture was analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy after a period of time. The extent of conversion of the RCM was determined by comparing the ratio of the integrals of the methylene protons in the substrate, δ2.61 (dt), with those in the product, δ2.98 (s). Example 7a Synthesis Procedure for the RCM of Diethyl Diallylmalonate Using Catalyst 8 at 40° C. A screw-cap NMR tube was charged with diethyl diallylmalonate (20 mg, 0.083 mmol) and CDCl3 (500 μL). A 0.064M solution of catalyst 5 (10 μL, 6.4×10−4 mmol, 0.77 mol %) prepared in situ in THF-d8 was added by syringe and the mixture was heated at 40° C. for 30 minutes, after which 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed close-to-full conversion (>97%) to the RCM product (by comparing the ratio of the integrals of the methylene protons in the substrate material at δ 2.61 with those in the product at δ 2.99). (see, e.g., Ritter, T.; Hejl, A.; Wenzel, A. G.; Funk, T. W.; Grubbs, R. H.

A solution of the olefin metathesis catalyst—prepared by method 2 as described above—(0.085M, 6 μL, 0.51 μmol, 1.0 mol %) was added to the N,N-diallyl-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide solution via syringe. The solution was transferred to an NMR tube equipped with a screw-cap septum top. The NMR tube was then capped and placed in an oil bath regulated at 40° C. After 1 hour, the reaction mixture was analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy to reveal full conversion to the RCM product (no substrate and no side-product detected).

The cyclization of N-allyl-N-(hex-5-enyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide to yield an eight-membered-ring olefin could not be achieved (Table 1; entry 6), as previously reported for other RCM catalysts (See, Kirkland, T. A.; Grubbs, R. H. J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 7310-7318).

Example 13 In-Situ Catalyst Stability To investigate the stability of the in-situ catalysts prepared according to the invention, a solution of catalyst prepared by method 2 was stored in a vial under argon at room temperature for 2 weeks and then used in the RCM of diethyl diallylmalonate within 30 min at 40° C. as a freshly prepared solution (Table 2). The stored catalyst was shown to give essentially the same RCM conversion as un-stored catalyst. TABLE 2 Stability study of the in-situ catalyst solution.

Although not limited thereto, the results included herein demonstrate the use of a derivative of 1,1-diphenylprop-2-yn-1-ol that contains electron-donating substituents in the meta positions of one phenyl group (5) to generate a new olefin metathesis catalyst in situ via a simple one-step procedure. As is disclosed herein more generally, the invention provides new catalysts that are as active as a commercial first-generation Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst (2a) at promoting the formation of disubstituted five-, six-, and seven-membered ring cycloalkenes and are stable in solution for at least two weeks. Example 14a Generation of Olefin Metathesis Catalyst 6 from Decomposed Catalyst A 50 mL round bottom reaction flask equipped with a stir bar was charged with the Hoveyda-Grubbs 1st generation catalyst (0.5 g, 0.83 mmol) and dichloromethane (10 mL). The solution was exposed to ethylene (1 atm) and heated at 40° C. under stirring for 18 hours to decompose the Hoveyda-Grubbs 1st generation catalyst. The decomposed catalyst (i.e., the ruthenium-containing decomposition product) was isolated by evaporating the dichloromethane, triturating with pentane, filtering and drying the solid under vacuum. The decomposed catalyst (25 mg) was treated with 1-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol (5, 30 mg, 0.11 mmol) in THF-d8 (400 μL) at 70° C. for 4 hours according to Scheme 4 to give 6 as the major ruthenium-containing species (according to NMR spectroscopy). Example 14b Generation of Olefin Metathesis Catalyst 8 from Decomposed Catalyst A 50 mL round bottom reaction flask equipped with a stir bar was charged with the Hoveyda-Grubbs 1st generation catalyst (0.5 g, 0.83 mmol) and dichloromethane (10 mL). The solution was exposed to ethylene (1 atm) and heated at 40° C. under stirring for 18 hours to decompose the Hoveyda-Grubbs 1st generation catalyst. The decomposed catalyst (i.e., the ruthenium-containing decomposition product) was isolated by evaporating the dichloromethane, triturating with pentane, filtering and drying the solid under vacuum. The decomposed catalyst (25 mg) was treated with 1-(3,5-diisopropoxyphenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol (7, 36 mg, 0.11 mmol) in THF-d8 (400 μL) at 70° C. for 4 hours according to Scheme 4 shown in Example 14a to give 8 as the major ruthenium-containing species (according to NMR spectroscopy).
