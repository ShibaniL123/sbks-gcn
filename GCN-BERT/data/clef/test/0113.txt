Precious metal recovery This invention relates to a process for recovering precious metals from the surfaces of process equipment, in particular to the recovery of precious metals from the surfaces of ammonia oxidation apparatus. Ammonia oxidation is carried out industrially with air to generate nitric oxide, which used to make nitric acid (the Ostwald Process) and with air and methane to generate hydrogen cyanide (the Andrussow Process). In both processes, the reactant gases are mixed and passed at elevated temperature and pressure through a reaction vessel in which is placed a pack of platinum/rhodium gauzes that catalyse the oxidation reactions. The gauzes are typically circular and are supported on a frame or basket that holds them tangential to the flow of gases through the reactor. The catalyst pack may also comprise one or more palladium-rich gauzes, known as “catchment gauzes” that act to capture volatilised platinum. Downstream of the catalyst, heat exchange equipment recovers heat from the product gas mixture which is then passed to downstream equipment to generate and recover nitric acid or hydrogen cyanide. In use, small quantities of the precious metals are volatilised and lost from the catalyst to be deposited on the surfaces of the heat exchange and downstream equipment. Such lost catalyst material may be recovered by a cleaning process, separated from other materials recovered in the cleaning process, and re-used. Previously adopted methods for cleaning tube side heat exchangers for precious metal recovery have included a mild chemical treatment followed by low pressure water washing or the use of a mechanical reaming system, involving a rotating cutting head being hydraulically driven down the equipment using a vacuum to draw off the PGM oxides, in dust form, removed by the cutting tool. RU2083261 C1 discloses a process for the recovery of sludges containing platinum group metals from the internal surfaces of units that use platinum catalysts by treatment of the surfaces with an aqueous solution of an absorbent, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium nitrate, sodium tripolyphosphate, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, oxalic acid, formic acid, acetic acid and amines, with circulation of the aqueous solution at a velocity head at 10"5-20 Pa, with subsequent recovery of separated sludge by means of filtration. Such washing of the surfaces is relatively slow and generates a significant quantity of acidic or alkaline aqueous effluent. There is a need for a process which overcomes the problems of the prior art processes. RU2202635 discloses methods for the extraction of sludges containing platinoids from surfaces of equipment in chemical plants such as plants for production of hydroxylamine, nitric acid and hydrocyanic acid, by treatment of the surfaces with liquid jets at certain velocity head ranges, followed by separation of sludge. In one embodiment, sludge is extracted from surfaces of apparatus made from carbon steel or 1-10% alloys of steel with the aid of water fed at a velocity head ranging from 110 to 260 MPa. In another embodiment, sludge is extracted from surfaces of apparatus made from titanium or 10.1 to 50% alloyed steels at a velocity head from 35 to 140 Mpa. Such processes remain inefficient for the removal of platinum and improvements are required. Accordingly the invention provides a process for the recovery of precious metals from inside surfaces of one or more tubes in heat exchange process equipment comprising the steps of applying a stream of water at pressure to the surfaces to form a suspension containing the precious metal, and passing the suspension through a filtration unit to separate the precious metal from the water, wherein the stream of water is applied at pressures in the range 70-ISO MPa using high-pressure jetting equipment comprising a nozzle having multiple orifices that direct the water radially from the nozzle to the inside of the one or more tubes. The process equipment may be any apparatus in which precious metal catalysts are subjected to high temperatures such that the may be volatilised and deposited on the within the tubes within the equipment. Particular examples are combustion apparatus for the oxidation of VOC’s, and apparatus for the oxidation of ammonia. Such process equipment may comprise combustion apparatus and heat exchange apparatus each having surfaces that may become coated with precious metal residues. The present invention is particularly suitable for recovering precious metal catalyst residues from tubes within ammonia oxidation apparatus. Apparatus for the oxidation of ammonia is well known and comprises a burner vessel with an inlet for an air and ammonia mixture, which may additionally contain methane, and a catalyst gauze pack comprising one or more precious metal catalysts. Precious metal gauzes may be formed by weaving or knitting or otherwise forming precious metal filaments into a gauze-like structure. Such catalyst gauzes are well established and may consist of platinum or platinum alloy filaments woven to provide rectangular interstices, knitted to provide a regular looped structure or simply agglomerated to provide a non-woven irregular structure. The precious metal ammonia oxidation catalyst is preferably platinum (Pt) or a platinum alloy, such as an alloy of platinum with rhodium (Rh) and/or palladium (Pd). The gauze pack may further comprise one or more catchment gauzes, based on palladium, arranged downstream of the catalyst gauzes that capture volatilised catalyst. Despite the presence of catchment gauzes, precious metals particularly platinum, palladium and rhodium are volatilised from the gauze pack during operation and become deposited on downstream apparatus. The precious metals recovered by the process may therefore comprises one or more metals selected from the group consisting of platinum, palladium and rhodium. The catalyst may be heated to temperatures in the range 700-1000°C and produces a product gas mixture at these temperatures which is capable of volatilising precious metals in the catalyst and catchment. The burner vessel further comprises an outlet for the product gas mixture. Upstream and/or downstream of the outlet, the burner vessel may comprise heat exchange apparatus such as a waste heat boiler fed with water/steam, which is used to cool the product gas mixture. The heat exchange apparatus typically comprises a tube-and-shell heat exchanger with the coolant passed around the outside of the tubes and the product gas mixture passed through the tubes. The heat exchange apparatus comprises one or more tube and shell heat exchangers that produce the cooled product gas mixture. In the present invention, the process equipment comprises heat exchange apparatus containing one or more tubes and at least one of the surfaces to which the stream of water is applied is the inside of the one or more tubes. The tubes may have an internal diameter of 20-60mm, typically 20-30mm, and a length of 1 -10m. The cooled product gas mixture is passed to downstream equipment to generate and recover nitric acid or hydrogen cyanide. The process for the recovery of precious metals from surfaces of process equipment comprises applying a stream of water at high pressure to the surfaces. The water applied to the surfaces may be demineralised water or mains water, but is preferably free of salts or additives. The water connection and supply maybe provided by the plant water supply with a feed directly into a header tank used to supply equipment capable of generating the high-pressure water, which may be termed high-pressure jetting equipment. Conventional high-pressure jetting equipment may be used as long as it is capable of generating the water at a pressure in the range 70-150 MPa (770-1500 bar, or 10150-21750psi). Below 70 MPa the pressure is insufficient for effective removal of the precious metal residues. Above 150MPa difficulties arise with the integrity of the equipment and/or the safety of the operator. The pressures herein are all gauge pressures. Particularly preferred high-pressure jetting equipment comprises, (i) a pump capable of delivering water at a pressure in the range 70-150 MPa, (ii) a length of suitable pressure-rated hose connected to the pump, (iii) a control valve, connected to the hose (iv) one or more reducing bushes if necessary, (ν) a lance, connected to the control valve, (vi) a connecting tube between the lance and the nozzle; and (vii) a nozzle, connected to the end of the connecting tube. The high-pressure jetting equipment may be fed by a commercially available multi-cylinder high pressure pump driven by electrical or diesel power. The pump desirably has a safety release valve fitted set to 2000 psi above the maximum working pressure. This safety provision ensures the release of any excess pressure build up caused by blockages that may occur within the equipment. The pressure-rated hose, which may be 10-20m in length, is desirably rated at 22000psi and transfers high-pressure water from the pump to the delivery end of the apparatus, i.e. the nozzle. The control valve is an on/off control, which may be operated manually by the operator, preferably as a foot-control valve, that allows for simple control by the equipment operator’s foot of the delivery of pressurised water through the nozzle to the surfaces to be treated. Reducing bushes may be used, if necessary, to facilitate any reduction required in size from hose-to-hose, hose to control valve or hose-to-lance. The lance may be rigid but is preferably a reduced diameter flexible hose, rated for the delivery pressure, which connects the hose from the pump to the nozzle. The preferred lance, which may be termed a “flexi-lance”, provides the operator with the ability to pass the nozzle into confined spaces such as down the inside of individual tubes to deliver the pressurised water. Due to the flexibility, the lance makes it easier to insert the nozzle into tubes, ducts or other parts of the equipment, particularly when working within a confined space. The connecting tube is a short length of rigid tube, which may be made from stainless steel, typically about 100-300 mm in length, fitted between the end of the lance and the nozzle. The purpose of the connecting tube, which may be referred to as a “stinger bar”, is to alert the operator to the proximity of the nozzle so that the flow of the water to the nozzle may be stopped before the nozzle is removed from a tube. Otherwise the operator may be exposed to injury from the high pressure liquid. In the present invention, when cleaning the inside of tubes, the nozzle comprises multiple orifices that direct the water radially from the nozzle. Preferably the nozzle is 2-3mm smaller than the diameter of the tube being cleaned ensuring the nozzle performs at the optimum pressure. The design of the nozzle thus ensures complete coverage of the internal tube surface to be cleaned. In a preferred design, the nozzle comprises between two and six, preferably two to four 90-degree jets. Furthermore, additional jets at other angles to the flow through the lance may be provided. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the nozzle comprises two-to-four 90-degree jets, with two or more jets angled back towards the lance, e.g. at about 60 degrees, which act to drive the nozzle down the tube. Access to the surfaces being treated can be gained by the removal of a section of the plant or by entering the vessel via a man way entry point, preferably ensuring full access to both ends of the heat exchanger. This allows the process to be performed from one end with the resulting suspension of water and precious metal residues collected from both ends. Furthermore, when entering a vessel to perform the process, the ducting or end-dome may acts as a catchment pot for the resulting suspension. Should sections of the plant require removal in order to gain access to specific components, a catchment tank may be placed at floor level with a curtain or tent enclosure erected to protect against loss of precious metal. A process using the preferred high-pressure jetting equipment to recover precious metals from the inside of one or more tubes may be carried out as follows. The high-pressure jetting equipment may be initially set up without the nozzle and the equipment allowed to operate in a turnover mode to release any impurities or trapped air from the equipment. For cleaning heat exchange tubes, the nozzle may be inserted into a tube by about 75mm and the control valve pressed to release the pressurised water to the nozzle. The pressure of water is increased to the operating pressure by adjusting the power to the pumps. The optimum operating pressure for cleaning the inside of tubes is in the range 100-138 MPa (14,500psi and 20,000psi). Once the desired operating pressure has been reached, the operator feeds the lance/nozzle down the inside of the tube at a rate of about 500mm/second. Once the nozzle reaches the furthest point (e.g. at the opposite end of the tube), the operator pulls the lance/nozzle back along the tube at a rate of about 400mm/second until the stinger bar can be seen. At this point the nozzle is pulled back at a slower rate until the edge of the nozzle is visible. The control valve is then released which in turn stops the flow of pressurised water to the nozzle. The procedure is then repeated for all of the tubes from which precious metal is to be recovered. To assist with speeding up the process where limited time is available for performing the cleaning operation on multiple tubes, multiple lances may be used. The multiple lances may be fed from a single pump and control valve. The multiple lances may be arranged on a mobile support frame designed to insert the lances into multiple tubes in a single operation. Certain heat exchanger designs may have refractory insulation materials and ferrules within the process equipment. Saturation of the insulation material during high-pressure jetting and/or low-pressure washing may present problems when the plant re-starts. Should the integrity of the insulation be compromised through soaking or by being dislodged or broken during precious metal recovery, this can result in costly repairs and delays. To overcome these problems a series of tube bungs, in particular inflatable tube bungs, may be inserted into the end the tubes at which the insulation is present. If desired, a continual feed of compressed air into the bungs can be fed to ensure the integrity of the seals is maintained. Operators at the opposite end of the tubes may insert the lance and nozzle along the tube without applying any water until the bung-end of the tube is reached. Upon reaching the tube bung, the nozzle is withdrawn slightly, e.g.by about 100 mm, the control valve switched and the high-pressure water applied while withdrawing the lance and nozzle at about 300mm/second until the stinger bar is observed. The method is typically repeated one or more times. After cleaning, the bung may be removed. Desirably a compressed air line with a triggered nozzle is inserted into the tubes to blow any excess water still remaining through the tubes and away from the insulation. If desired a camera, e.g. of the endoscope-type, may be inserted into the treated tubes to determine whether a second treatment of the tubes is required. Once satisfied that the surfaces are cleaned of precious metal residues. The high-pressure jetting equipment may be removed and the cleaned surfaces washed with water at low pressure. The tubes, tube plate and surrounding ducting or catchment tent erected at each end of the unit may be washed down. This low-pressure washing procedure may be carried out using a conventional 5,000psi diesel driven pressure wash with a pistol grip lance and conventional fan nozzle. The precious metals are recovered as solid residues, often with corrosion products of the surfaces being treated. The solid residues form a suspension containing the precious metal in the water used to clean the surfaces. The process also comprises passing a suspension containing the precious metal residues and water through a filtration unit to separate the precious metal residues from the water. The high-pressure jetting equipment may use 30-60 litres of water per minute which is collected, along with the displaced precious metal residues as a suspension, within one or more tanks installed inside the process equipment or within the chambers and ducting of the process equipment. The suspension may be pumped to a containment tank outside of the process equipment using a suitable pump, e.g. an air diaphragm pump. The containment tank may be transported off-site for separation of the precious metal residues or the containment tank or the installed tank or chambers and ducting within the process equipment containing the suspension may be connected to a local filtration unit, e.g. a centrifuge, a column filtration system or a plate and frame filter press, containing a suitable filtration medium, and the suspension pumped through the filtration unit to recover the precious metal residues. 1-micron filter papers and/or filter cloths or filter bags may be used to collect the solid residues containing the precious metals. If desired, the filtrate may be analysed for precious metals before disposal to confirm the efficiency of the filtration process. The filtration medium is recovered from the filtration unit with the precious metal residues and sent for recovery. Recovery of the precious metals from the filtration medium may be by conventional precious metal refining as is known in the art. The process of the present invention provides a more efficient method for cleaning heat exchangers, boilers, items tube-side in the nitric oxide flow and brick-lined chambers than the prior art methods. It is also very cost-effective, to quickly clean plant in-situ with minimum disruption. High pressure jetting takes on average less than 30 seconds to make a forward and reverse pass of each tube, meaning that a 2000 tube unit can be cleaned in a matter of days. The process is capable of recovering 90-99% of precious metal material compared with 55-65% by mechanical means. Furthermore, because residues are suspended in water and pumped through a sealed circuit to filtration, no precious metal oxides are lost into the atmosphere as dust. The use of water as opposed to chemical cleaning also makes the present process more environmentally friendly. In addition, there is no disposal of spent chemical effluents. The working environment is also more operator-friendly having no hazardous chemicals or dust exposure. The invention is described by reference to the following example. Example 1 A high pressure jetting process according to the invention was applied as described above to a tubular heat exchanger. A 1900 tube heat exchanger was cleaned by replicating site conditions and a precious metal recovery of >90% was obtained by performing one full forward and reverse pass of the preferred high pressure jetting equipment. A further 4% recovery was achieved by performing a second full pass. The recovery was made using a pressure of 100MPa (1000bar). 1.
