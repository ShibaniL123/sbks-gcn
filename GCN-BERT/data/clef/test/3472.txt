Cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 belong to the class of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). CB1 receptors are expressed both centrally and peripherally while CB2 receptors are predominately expressed peripherally, primarily on immune cells and tissues. The pharmacological and therapeutic potential of the CB2 receptor has been reviewed recently (Br. J. Pharmacol. (2008) 153, 319-334) identifying CB2 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of pain, in particular, inflammatory and neuropathic pain. CB2 agonists, in particular CB2-selective agonists, provide a target for treating pain with limited centrally mediated side effects. WO 2004/037823 is directed to purine compounds and use thereof as cannabinoid receptor ligands, in particular as CB1 receptor antagonists. WO 2010/019762 discloses purine compounds as cannabinoid receptor blocker for the treatment of e.g. obesity, neuropathic pain. As a consequence of side effects associated with current oral pharmacological agents, there continues to be a need for the development of alternative therapies for the treatment of pain.

A compound of Formula (I) can be prepared in accordance with reactions as depicted in Scheme 1. In Step 1, 4,6-dichloro-2-methyl-pyrimidin-5-ylamine is reacted with an amine (1) in a discplacement reaction to provide a diamino pyrimidine (2). The reaction can proceed in the presence of a suitable base, such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, in a suitable solvent such as isopropanol, at an elevated temperature such as about 100 to 160 °C, preferably in a sealed tube. Alternatively the reaction can be accomplished using microwave irradiation. In Step 2, an imine is formed from the diamino pyrimidine (2) and a benzaldehyde (3) in the presence of an acid catalyst such as ferric chloride on silica, or p-toluenesulfonic acid. The reaction takes place in a suitable solvent such as 1,4-dioxane or toluene, at an elevated temperature such as about 70 °C to 110 °C. In the abscence of silica, molecular sieves can be added to remove water from the reaction. After filtration to remove the solids and concentration, the oxidative cyclization of the imine can be accomplished in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, in the presence of an oxidate such as DDQ, at a suitable temperature such as about -30 to 40 °C to give a 6-chloropurine of formula (4). In Step 3, a 6-chloropurine (4) undergoes a displacement reaction with a piperazine (5) to provide a piperazinyl purine of Formula (I). The reaction can proceed in the presence of a suitable base, such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol, at an elevated temperature such as about 50 to 100 °C. Alternatively the reaction can be accomplished using microwave irradiation. It will be recognized by one skilled in the art that the amine functionality present in the piperazinyl moiety, can be protected with a suitable protecting group such as tBOC. After the displacement in Step 3, the protecting group can be subsequently removed and the amine acylated or alkylated to make further compounds of Formula (I). In Scheme 2 is depicted an alternative method for obtaining a compound of Formula (I). A diamino pyrimidine (2) is combined together with a benzaldehyde (3) and a piperazine (5) in the presence of a suitable oxidant, such as nitrobenzene or acetic acid. The reaction is performed in a suitable solvent, such as methoxybenzene, at an elevated temperature such as about 120 to 150 °C, with the reaction open to the atmosphere, to provide a compound of Formula (I). In Scheme 3 is depicted another alternative for making a compound of Formula (I). In Step 1, 6-chloro-2-methyl-4,5-pyrimidinediamine is reacted with a benzaldehyde (3) to provide a 6-chloropurine (6), essentially as described in Scheme 1, Step 2, above. In Step 2, a 6-chloropurine (6) is reacted with a piperazine (5) to provide a piperazinyl purine (7) essentially as described in Scheme 1, Step 3, above. In Step 3, a piperazinyl purine (7) is alkylated with a haloalkane (8) (wherein X = Br or I) to give a compound of Formula (I). It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that there are various methods to accomplish such alkylations. For example, the piperazinyl purine (7) can be treated with a suitable base such as sodium hydride, potassium hydride, cesium or potassium carbonate, or sodium or potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide. Suitable solvents include inert solvents such as THF, dioxane, DMF, DMAC, or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. Preferred conditions use sodium hydride, in THF, at a suitable temperature such as about -70 to 50 °C to provide a compound of Formula (I). It will be recognized by one skilled in the art that compounds of Formula (I) wherein R2 contains a terminal alcohol, can be protected during the alkylation step by use of a suitable protecting group and subsequently removal of the protecting group. In Scheme 4 is depicted yet another alternative for making a compound of Formula (I). In Step 1, 5-amino-4,6-dichloro-2-methypyrimidine is acylated with a benzoyl chloride (9) followed by displacement with an amine (1) to provide an amino amido pyrimidine (10). The reaction is accomplished in an inert solvent such as dimethyl acetamide or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at an elevated temperature such as 60 to 100 °C in the presence of a benzoyl chloride (9). Water is added and heating continued before adding a suitable organic base such as diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine. This is followed by addition of an amine (1) with continued heating. In Step 2, the amino amido pyrimidine (10) is combined with a piperazine (5) in a sealed vessel to provide a compound of Formula (I). The reaction takes place in a suitable solvent such as isopropanol, at an elevated temperature such as 140 to 180 °C in the presence of a suitable organic base, such as diisopropylethylamine.

CB1 and CB2in vitro functional assays Exemplified compounds are tested in agonist mode using a SPA based GTP-γ-35S binding assay. All assay components are prepared in assay buffer made up of 20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, (pH 7.4 at room temperature). Semi-log compound dilutions are done in assay buffer containing BSA (final 0.125%). GTP-γ35-S binding is measured in a 96 well format using a whole membrane capture technique for the CB1 assay and modifications of an antibody capture technique previously described (DeLapp et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 289:946-955, 1999) for the CB2 assay. All incubations are done at room temperature. CB1: hCB1-CHO membranes, GDP (luM final), and saponin (10 ug/mL final) are added to assay buffer and homogenized. Diluted compounds, GTP-γ-35S (500 nM final) and membranes are added to the assay plate and incubated for 30 minutes. Then 1mg/well Wheatgerm Agglutinin SPA bead is added, and the plates are sealed, vortexed, and incubated for an additional hour. Plates are then centrifuged at 700 x g for 10 minutes and counted for 1 minute per well using a scintillation counter. CB2-Sf9: hCB2-Sf9 membranes and GDP (1uM final) are added to assay buffer and homogenized. Diluted compounds and membranes are added to the assay plate and preincubated for 15 minutes. This is followed by addition of GTP-γ-35S (500 nM final) and another 35 minute incubation. Next a mixture containing Nonidet P40 detergent (0.2% final), anti-Gi antibody (final dilution of 1:362), and 1.25 ing anti-rabbit antibody scintillation proximity assay beads are added. The plates are then sealed, vortexed, and incubated for an additional 2 hours before centrifuging and counting as for CB1. To analyze data, first subtract background from all wells. Determine percent agonist efficacy by normalizing agonist/inverse agonist dose response data to a full agonist (methanandamide) response. Analyze the data using a 4-parameter logistic reduced fit with Activity Base and XLFit3. All of the exemplified compounds were tested essentially as described above and each was found to have a relative EC50 value for CB2 of ≤100 nM. Example 6 has a relative EC50 value for CB2 of 2.7 nM and for CB1 of >100000 nM. Example 19 has a relative EC50 value for CB2 of 22.4 nM and for CB1 of >100000 nM. Thus, compounds of the present invention show CB2in vitro activity. Further, compounds of the present invention show selectivity for CB2 over CB1 and so provide limited potential for centrally mediated side effects. Displacement of 3H-CP55940 from human and rat CB2 receptors The methods of Felder et al. (Mol. Pharmaocol. 48:443-450, 1995) were utilized with minor modifications. Specifically, membrane homogenates from cells stably or transiently expressing the human or rat CB2 receptor were washed by centrifugation and diluted into a 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% BSA buffer. Specific binding of 3H-CP55940 was defined with 1 µM CP55940. The ability of compounds to displace specific 3H-CP55940 binding was tested over a range of concentrations in the Tris, MgCl2, EDTA, BSA buffer in the presence of 1% dimethyl sulfoxide by incubating at room temperature for 90 minutes in a volume of 300 µl. Unifilter 96-well microplates pretreated with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% polysorbate 20 in water were washed three times with cold Tris buffer. The reaction mixture was then transferred to the filter plate immediately before terminating the incubation by rapid filtration and three 200 µl washes with cold Tris buffer. After the filter plates dried, microscint 20 was added to each well, the plate sealed and counted for determination of disintegrations per minute. The displacement curves were graphed and the resulting Ki values determined utilizing Graphpad Prism. Example 8 has a human receptor Ki value of 142 nM and a rat receptor Ki value of 37.5 nM. Example 13 has a human receptor Ki value of 65.2 nM and a rat receptor Ki value of 215 nM. Thus, compounds of the present invention are shown to bind to both human and rat CB2 receptors in vitro. Monoiodoacetate (MIA) model For all studies male Lewis rats of approximately 8 weeks of age at the time of MIA injection are used to measure pain in the MIA model. The rats are housed in groups of 2 or 3 per cage and maintained in a constant temperature and on a 12 hour light/12 hour dark cycle. Animals have free access to food and water at all times except during data collection. In the standard MIA model the right knees of each rat are injected with 0.3mg MIA in 50ul of saline and the left knees with 50ul of saline. Pain is measured at varying times after MIA injection (not normally before 10 day post MIA injection) using incapacitance testing. This measures the difference in hind paw weight bearing between the MIA and saline injected knees, and each measurement is the average of 3 separate measurements each measured over 1 second. For studies with CB2 agonists rats are randomized into dose groups (n = 5 or 6) and then dosed once with the compound under investigation. Dosing is staggered by 15 minutes for each rat and at a predetermined time post-dose (usually 2 hours), pain measured using incapacitance testing. Studies are routinely run with 4 groups, vehicle (1% carboxy methyl cellulose in water plus 0.25% polysorbate 80) and 3 compound groups which can be either single compounds at a single dose or the same compound at 3 doses. Results are reported as the difference in weight bearing between saline and MIA injected knees and statistical comparisons are made between vehicle treated and compound treated animals to assess the effect of compounds on knee pain in the model. Example 19 was tested essentially as described above and found to reduce pain versus vehicle at doses of 0.3 and 1mg/kg. Example 18 was tested essentially as described above and found to reduce pain versus vehicle at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. Thus, compounds of the present invention are shown to be useful in the treatment of pain, in particular joint pain. Chemotherapy-induced pain assay Male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats 150-200 grams are acclimated to the vivarium for 7 days. The animals are maintained in a constant temperature and on a 12 hour light/12 hour dark cycle, and housed in groups of 3-4 with water and food ad libitum. Twice daily dosing of compound at 10 mg/kg (oral), morphine at 5 mg/kg, and vehicle commences on Day 1 of the study, and continues through the duration of the study (Day 18). Paclitaxel at 1 mg/kg (intraperitoneal) is administered on Days 2, 4, 6, and 8, for a cumulative dose of 4 mg/kg in order to induce chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Rats are placed in individual plexiglass chambers with a wire mesh platform bottom to allow access to the hindpaw. After an acclimation period of 15 minutes to 1 hour, the mid-plantar hind paws are assessed within the sciatic nerve distribution. A series of 8 von Frey hairs with logarithmically incremental stiffness (0.41, 0.70, 1.20, 2.00, 3.63, 5.50, 8.50, and 15.10 g) are applied to the hind paws. The von Frey hairs are presented perpendicular to the plantar surface with sufficient force to cause slight bending. Stimuli are presented at intervals of several seconds. A positive response is noted if the paw is sharply withdrawn or if flinching immediately upon removal of the hair is observed. On study days, behavioral endpoints are evaluated 1 hour post-dose. Score patterns are evaluated using the Dixon up-down method, and translated to a response threshold (1980, Ann Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 20:441-462). The maximum applied force is 15.10 grams. The initial behavior assessment occurs on Day 10 of the study, and subsequent measures are made on Study Days 12, 15, and 18. Results are expressed as mean values with standard errors of the mean (mean ± SE) for an n of 12 per group. All statistical evaluations are conducted utilizing a one-way ANOVA followed by comparison to the control group by Dunnett's Method. Statistical significance is assumed when p<0.05. Statistical analyses are performed using JMP statistical analysis software (SAS Research Institute, version 6.0.2). Vehicle (mean ± SE)Example 19 10mg/kg (mean ± SE)Morphine 5mg/kg (mean ± SE)Day 107.83 ± 1.3511.25 ± 1.318.16 ± 1.22Day 127.12 ± 1.277.38 ± 0.953.67 ± 0.30*Day 154.86 ± 0.957.90 ± 1.04*3.84 ± 0.45Day 183.27 ± 0.346.02 ± 0.72*3.46 ± 0.42*Indicates statistical significance Mean paw withdrawal latencies with standard errors are shown for Example 19, morphine, and vehicle in the above table. Compared to both vehicle and morphine-treated animals, Example 19-treated animals developed less allodynia over the duration of the study. Thus, Example 19 of the present invention is shown to be useful in the prevention of pain, in particular chemotherapy-induced pain such as chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Dose-ranging toxicity study in beagle dogs One male and one female beagle dog are used to evaluate the acute toxicity after a single oral gavage dose of CB2 agonist. The dogs are housed individually and maintained in a constant temperature and on a 12 hour light/12 hour dark cycle. CB2 agonist is prepared in vehicle (1% hydroxyethylcellulose, 0.25% polysorbate 80, and 0.05% Dow Corning® Antifoam 1510-US in purified water) and administered by oral gavage at a dose volume of 2 mL/kg. Dogs are observed for mortality and clinical observations (before dosing, 2 hours postdose, in the afternoon and daily thereafter). Food consumption is assessed by daily visual assessment of food remaining. Blood is collected before dosing and 48 hours after dosing to evaluate effects on haematology and clinical chemistry parameters. Blood is collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours postdose to evaluate toxicokinetic plasma drug concentrations. Example 19 was tested essentially as described above at a single oral dose of 30 mg/kg. Post-dose clinical observations were limited to vomiting and dilated pupils. Vomiting was noted only in the female dog at 19 minutes, 39 minutes and 2 hours post-dose. Dilated pupils were noted in the male and female dogs from 2 to 4 hours post-dose. Decreased faeces and minimal decreased food consumption was also noted in the female dog. Effects on haematology were limited to a slight decrease in reticulocyte count in the female dog (39% change relative to pre-dose). The mean Area-Under the Curve from 0-24 hours (AUC0-24hr) at 30 mg/kg was 44451 ng•hr/mL. The mean maximum concentration (Cmax) at 30 mg/kg was 7537 ng/mL. Thus, certain compounds of the present invention are shown to have limited toxicity in dogs at 30 mg/kg and as a result the potential for an acceptable side effect profile in humans.
