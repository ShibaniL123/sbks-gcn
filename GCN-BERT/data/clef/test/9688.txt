Example 1-Synthesis of 2-(4-(((2-amino-4-oxo-3,4dihydropteridin-6-yl)methyl)amino)benzamido)-5-((3'6'-dihydroxy-3-oxo-3H-spiro[isobenzofuran-1,9'-xanthen]-5-yl)amino-5-oxopentanoic acid (compound 13)
A mixture of 100 mg (0.22 mmoles) folic acid (compound 10) in an anhydrous 20 mL DMF solution plus 4 mL pyridine was heated and vigorously shaken to get a clear golden solution. To this solution was added 6 equivalents of DCC (280 mg, 1.36 mmoles). The reaction mixture was mixed in an ultrasound bath in the dark for 15 minutes twice, while the bath warmed to about 29Â° C. The resulting cloudy solution was added to a flask containing 1.1 equivalents 5-aminofluorescein (86.5 mg, 0.249 moles) (compound 11). The resulting reaction mixture was wrapped with aluminum foil and stirred at room temperature overnight. After about 18 hours the mixture was filtered through celite and added drop-wise to a mixture of 70 mL ether and 30 mL acetone. The cloudy mixture was stored in the dark in a freezer for several days. The solid (compound 12) was filtered off, washed with ether and air-dried to a constant mass of 115.7 mg (66.3%).
