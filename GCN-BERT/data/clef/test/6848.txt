3-hexyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)thiophene
A flask with 36.1 g (190 mmol, 2.00 eq) water-free CuI was evacuated and purged with argon several times. A solution of 27.9 g (94.8 mmol, 1.00 eq) 3-hexyl-2-iodothiophene and 24.0 ml (190 mmol, 2.00 eq) methyl 2,2-difluoro-2-fluorosulfonylacetate in 250 ml dimethylformamide DMF was added and the reaction mixture stirred at 90° C. for 24 h. 6.00 ml (47.4 mmol, 0.50 eq) methyl-2,2-difluoro-2-fluorosulfonylacetate was added and stirring continued for another day at 90° C. After cooling down to room temperature the reaction mixture was diluted with water and MTBE and filtered. The organic layer was washed once with water and twice with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by distillation to obtain a colourless oil (14.9 g, 63%, bp: 75-78° C. at 3 mbar).
