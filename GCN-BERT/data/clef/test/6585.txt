The present invention relates to a process for determining the correct positioning of an autostereoscopic tablet computer used to perform fixation disparity measurements in a subject through haploscopic observation of targets or stimuli. The present invention also relates to an apparatus for the implementation of the aforesaid method. At the state of the art, there are known different techniques for performing fixation disparity measurements in a subject through haploscopic observation of targets. More in particular, said measurements are performed by presenting the subject being examined with stimuli perceived by one eye and other stimuli perceived by the other eye, wherein, among other things, there is evaluated the perception of the lack of alignment of indices on the monitor of an autostereoscopic tablet computer, provided with frontal video camera means for shooting images and with image reproduction means for reproducing the images shot on a monitor of said autostereoscopic tablet computer (preferably in order improve implementation of said method said monitor has at least 1920 x 1200 pixels with a resolution of at least 100 pixels per mm2). The need for increasingly sophisticated diagnostics of the bulbus oculi of a subject, obtained by measuring the characteristic parameters linked to the sensorial process of visually capturing scenes external to the same subject, is directly linked to the need for increasingly greater precision in determining effective or suspected visual impairment. On the other hand, due to the growing availability, at the state of the art, of increasingly high performance lenses (take, for example, "progressive lenses") to correct a specific visual impairment, there is the inevitable need for methods and apparatus for performing tests that allow reliable and highly precise data concerning the existing or suspected visual impairment of the subject to be obtained. As mentioned, it is known to perform said measurements using tests and related apparatus, which allow the presence and extent of any fixation disparities to be identified. By way of example, there is known the performance of measurement of the visual abilities of a subject by presenting the same with stimuli for both binocular and monocular vision at distances comprised in a range between two and six meters (the "distance vision test"). Currently, the aforesaid type of visual ability measurement is combined with further techniques for the same measurement, but performed by presenting the subject with stimuli for both binocular and monocular vision at a distance between thirty and sixty centimeters (the "near vision test") and preferably forty centimeters. As mentioned, in order to perform the aforesaid known measurement techniques, there is advantageously used a 10" autostereoscopic tablet computer, capable of presenting the subject being examined with some stimuli perceived by one eye, for example the right eye, and other stimuli only by the other eye, the left eye, the monitor of the same autostereoscopic tablet having at least 1920 x 1200 pixels and a resolution of at least 100 pixels per mm2. In order to obtain reliable results of the aforesaid evaluation and measurement operations, correct positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer by the subject being examined is a fundamental requirement; likewise, it is also important for the same autostereoscopic tablet computer to be maintained in the same correct position during the same measurement. In this direction, one of the greatest problems encountered while performing said fixation disparity measurement operations by a subject, lies in the prejudice, in terms of poor precision and low reliability of the results obtained by the same measurement, due to incorrect positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer during the measurement. In fact, it was noted in several cases that finding the correct positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer, and maintaining this positioning during the measurement, is often difficult and awkward for the subject being examined. This also becomes particularly evident when taking into due consideration the fact that the person being examined can be any subject, and as such not necessarily in possession of particular and specific technical knowledge. On the other hand, said known methods do not allow the operator performing the measurement to be able to provide prompt and targeted instructions to the subject on whom the measurement is being performed concerning the correct positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer, or to check that correct positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer is maintained during the measurement. An attempt to solve the aforesaid problems of the prior art was provided by means of a positioning process that provides for presenting, on the monitor of a tablet computer as said, two circular areas, one positioned on the right of the monitor of the tablet and the other on the left of the same monitor, in which the subject being examined is presented with uniform images, with shades of grey that vary according to the position with respect to the optimal position; in this case, the optimal positioning for measurement, which is difficult to achieve in operating condition, is the one in which the shades of grey in the two circular areas are perceived to be the same. However, it is evident that a similar positioning process is by no means suitable to solve the aforesaid problems of the prior art, firstly making it very difficult for the subject, especially if without specific skills, to identify the exact correspondence of the shades of grey of said two circular areas, in order to determine the correct positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer. Moreover, in order to check the exact correspondence of the shades of grey in the two circular areas, the subject on whom the measurement is being performed must continuously shift his/her fixation between the central area in which the stimulus is present, the left circular area and the right circular area, in which the areas of reference are provided, and therefore has to perform the test in conditions that are somewhat uncomfortable and anything but natural. On the other hand, said known positioning process does not allow the operator performing the measurement to provide any kind of assistance and/or control, either in relation to the correct positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer, or in regard to subsequently maintaining the same in the correct position to perform the measurement. Starting from the notion of these drawbacks, the present invention intends to provide a remedy. An object of the present invention is to provide a process for determining the correct positioning of an autostereoscopic tablet computer used to perform fixation disparity measurements in a subject through haploscopic observation of targets, which allows the subject on whom the measurement is being performed to obtain, in complete ease, the correct positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer, and to maintain this positioning during the same measurement in a simple way, with all the consequences in terms of reducing the time required to perform the test and considerably improving the reliability of the results of the same measurement. Moreover, an object of the present invention is to provide a process as indicated which allows the operator performing the measurement to provide prompt and targeted instructions to the subject on whom the measurement is being performed in relation to correctness of the positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer, and to check that the positioning of said autostereoscopic tablet computer is correctly maintained during the same measurement. On the other hand, an object of the present invention is to provide a process as said, which makes it easy to achieve the correct positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer, and subsequently to maintain said correct positioning during the measurement, also for subjects without particular technical knowledge. Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for the implementation of said process as mentioned. In view of these objects, the present invention provides for a process for determining the correct positioning of an autostereoscopic tablet computer used to perform fixation disparity measurements in a subject through haploscopic observation of targets, the essential characteristic of which forms the subject matter of claim 1; the present invention also provides for an apparatus for the aforesaid implementation, the essential characteristic of which forms the subject matter of claim 8. Further advantageous characteristics are described in the dependent claims. The aforesaid claims are intended as fully incorporated herein. The present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, with reference to the drawing attached hereto, which is purely exemplary and therefore nonlimiting, in which: Fig. 1 is a photographic reproduction of an autostereoscopic tablet computer viewed from the side of the monitor, the correct positioning of which for the purposes of performing the measurement is given by the fact that the ends of two indices are respectively positioned so that the upper index is positioned on the central and upper part of the forehead of the subject being examined and that the proximal end of the lower index is positioned on the tip of the nose of the same subject. In the following, there is provided the description of an exemplary embodiment of the process for determining the correct positioning of an autostereoscopic tablet computer used to perform fixation disparity measurements in a subject through haploscopic observation of targets, according to the present invention. According to what is known in the state of the art, the performance of fixation disparity measurements in a subject through haploscopic observation of targets essentially takes place according to the following steps of: performing a test by presenting the subject being examined, on said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 with stimuli S perceived by one eye and other stimuli S perceived by the other eye,evaluating the perception of the lack of alignment of indices 11a, 11b or of the correct merging of different images, presented on the monitor 12 of said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10, provided with frontal video camera means for shooting images and with image reproduction means for reproducing the images shot on said monitor 12, having at least 1920 x 1200 pixels with a resolution of at least 100 pixels mm2. For the purposes of the aforesaid measurement, said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10, on which there is installed dedicated software, must be positioned with respect to the subject being examined, with said monitor 12 and said frontal video camera means facing the same subject, complying with the requirements of correct distance and inclination between the face of the subject being examined and the monitor 12 of said autostereoscopic tablet computer. If the aforesaid requirements of correct distance and inclination between the face of the subject being examined and monitor 12 of said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 are not sufficiently satisfied, there is an inevitable risk in terms of poor reliability of the results of the same measurement. According to the present invention, said process for determining the correct positioning of an autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 used to perform fixation disparity measurements in a subject through haploscopic observation of targets, comprises the steps consisting of: providing a static image, on said monitor 12 of the autostereoscopic tablet computer 10, of two indices 11a, 11b, one upper 11a and the other lower 11b, having respective proximal ends and mutually aligned according to a vertical transverse median plane of the same monitor 12 containing the optical axis of said video camera means;providing an image, on said monitor of the autostereoscopic tablet computer 10, of a stimulus S characteristic of the test;at the same time shooting an image F of the face of the subject being examined, by means of said frontal video camera means of the autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 and displaying the same image on said same monitor 12, in the background with respect to said image of the stimulus S characteristic of the test and presented on the same monitor 12 with sufficient contrast to perceive said image F in the background. According to the invention, said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10, to satisfy said requirements of correct distance and inclination, is oriented and arranged, positioning said proximal ends of said indices 11a, 11b, one just above the stimulus S and the other just below the stimulus S, as shown in Fig. 1. In this way, the subject being examined is placed in the conditions to determine, in complete ease, the correct positioning of said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 for the performance of said fixation disparity measurements. Advantageously, said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 can be held by the hands of the subject being examined and is oriented and arranged, positioning said proximal ends of said indices 11a, 11b, the one just above the stimulus S and the other just below the stimulus S, so that the upper index 11a is positioned on the central and upper part of the forehead of the subject being examined and that said proximal end of the lower index 11b is positioned on the tip of the nose of the same subject. In this way, the subject being tested performs the test in a totally natural way, maintaining a position more or less similar to the position maintained when reading a book while seated. The naturalness of the position of the subject during performance of the measurement greatly facilitates maintaining the correct positioning of the tablet computer 10 during the measurement, and at the same time reduces the measurement time, with all the consequences in terms of reliability of the related results. Alternatively, said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 can be supported stably by means of a swivelling support (not shown); in this case, said swivelling support carrying said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 is oriented by the hands of the subject being examined and arranged, positioning said proximal ends of said indices 11a, 11b, the one just above the stimulus S and the other just below the stimulus S, so that the upper index 11a is positioned on the central and upper part of the forehead of the subject being examined and that said proximal end of the lower index 11b is positioned on the tip of the nose of the same subject. On the other hand, said swivelling support carrying said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 can alternatively be oriented by the hands of an operator other than the subject being examined (for example, the operator in charge of performing the measurement) and thus correctly arranged, as indicated above. In this way, once correct orientation of the autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 has been obtained, maintaining this orientation during the measurement is particularly easy and immediate, given that it is positioned on said support that cooperates to maintain the same in the desired position. In order to further facilitate the correct positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 by the subject on whom the measurement is being performed, said tablet computer 10 can be associated with a further (not shown) tablet computer (not autostereoscopic), on which there is installed dedicated software, which is operatively connected to said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 by means of a signal transmission network, and on the monitor of which there are reproduced, in real time with respect to said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10: said static image, reproduced on said monitor of the autostereoscopic tablet computer 10, of two indices 11a, 11b, one upper 11a and the other lower 11b, having respective proximal ends and mutually aligned according to a vertical transverse median plane of the same monitor 12 containing the optical axis of said video camera means;said image, reproduced on said monitor of the autostereoscopic tablet computer, of a stimulus S characteristic of the test;said image F of the face of the subject being examined, shot by means of said frontal video camera means of the autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 and displayed on the monitor 12 thereof, in the background with respect to said image of the stimulus S characteristic of the test and presented on the monitor 12 of said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 with just sufficient contrast to perceive said image F in the background. Said further tablet computer (not shown), advantageously assigned to the operator who performs the same measurement, allows this latter to display on the related monitor the same images simultaneously displayed to the subject being examined, so as to be able to provide the same with useful instructions in order to facilitate the correct positioning of his/her tablet computer 10, and to check, during the measurement, that the aforesaid correct positioning is maintained. Advantageously, the process according to the invention comprises a step of selectively controlling the display, on the monitor 12 of said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10, of said static image of two indices 11a, 11b, of said at least one image of a stimulus S and/or of said image F of the face of the subject being examined, through remote control means of said display provided in said further tablet computer, so that one, none or a plurality of said same images are visible on the monitor 12 of said autostereoscopic tablet computer. According to the preference of the subject being examined, said image F displayed in the background with respect to said image of the stimulus S characteristic of the test, on the monitor 12 of said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10, can be controlled by means of timed means that cause the disappearance thereof after a predetermined interval of time. Moreover, this does not exclude said image F from continuing to be present on said further tablet computer (if present) assigned to the operator, so that this latter is in a position to be able to check, in an easy and immediate way, that the correct positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 is maintained during the whole performance of the test. Advantageously, said image of said stimulus S is reproduced on said monitor 12 of said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 in a box outside which the remaining part of said monitor 12 is grey (as shown in Fig. 1) or filled with characters with the aim of creating confusion. It is understood that different modes of reproduction of said image of said stimulus, provided that they are suitable for the purpose, also fall within the scope of the present invention.

In the following, there is provided the description of an exemplary embodiment of an apparatus for determining the correct positioning of an autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 used to perform fixation disparity measurements in a subject through haploscopic observation of targets, by means of the process according to the present invention. Said apparatus comprises: a static image, on the monitor 12 of said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10, of two indices 11a, 11b, one upper 11a and the other lower 11b, having respective proximal ends and mutually aligned according to a vertical transverse median plane of the same monitor 12 containing the optical axis of said video camera means;an image, on said monitor 12 of the autostereoscopic tablet computer 10, of a stimulus S characteristic of the test;an image F of the face of the subject being examined, shot by means of said frontal video camera means of the autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 and displayed on said same monitor 12, in the background with respect to said image of the stimulus S characteristic of the test and presented on the same monitor 12 with just sufficient contrast to perceive said image F in the background. In order to satisfy said requirements of correct distance and inclination, the autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 is oriented and arranged, positioning said proximal ends of said indices 11a, 11b, the one just above the stimulus S and the other just below the stimulus S, so that the upper index 11a is positioned on the central and upper part of the forehead of the subject being examined and that said proximal end of the lower index 11b is positioned on the tip of the nose of the same subject. Advantageously, said image of said stimulus S occupies a box of said monitor 12 of said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 outside which the remaining part of said monitor 12 is grey or filled with characters with the aim of creating confusion. It is understood that different modes of reproduction of said image of said stimulus, provided that they are suitable for the purpose, fall within the scope of the present invention. According to the embodiment of the invention illustrated, said two indices 11a, 11b, one upper and the other lower are pointed, with points facing each other, and mutually aligned according to a vertical transverse median plane of the monitor 12 of the tablet computer 10 containing the optical axis of said video camera means. Evidently, different structures of said indices (not shown), provided that they are suitable for the purpose, are also possible according to the invention. According to preference, said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 can be supported stably by means of a swivelling support (not shown); alternatively, the same can be supported manually by the subject on whom the measurement is being performed, essentially in the manner of a book. Advantageously, said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10, on which there is installed dedicated software, is operatively connected with respect to a further tablet computer (not shown), by means of a signal transmission network, so that on the monitor of said further tablet computer there are reproduced, in real time with respect to said autostereoscopic tablet computer: said static image, reproduced on said monitor 12 of the autostereoscopic tablet computer 10, of two indices 11a, 11b, one upper 11a and the other lower 11b, having respective proximal ends and mutually aligned according to a vertical transverse median plane of the same monitor 12 containing the optical axis of said video camera means;said image, reproduced on said monitor 12 of the autostereoscopic tablet computer 10, of a stimulus S characteristic of the test;said image F of the face of the subject being examined, shot by means of said frontal video camera means of the autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 and displayed on the monitor 12 thereof, in the background with respect to said image of the stimulus S characteristic of the test and presented on the monitor 12 of said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10 with just sufficient contrast to perceive said image F in the background. Said further tablet computer (not shown), advantageously assigned to the operator who performs the same measurement or evaluation, allows this latter to display on the related monitor the same images simultaneously displayed to the subject being examined, so as to be able to provide this latter with useful instructions in order to facilitate the correct positioning of his/her tablet computer 10, and to check, during the measurement, that the aforesaid correct positioning is maintained. Advantageously, said apparatus comprises, according to the invention, remote control means, provided in said further tablet computer, of the display, on the monitor 12 of said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10, of said static image of two indices 11a, 11b, of said at least one image of a stimulus S and/or of said image F of the face of the subject being examined, which selectively allow one, none or a plurality of said same images to be displayed on the monitor 12 of said autostereoscopic tablet computer 10. As is apparent from the above, said process for determining the correct positioning of an autostereoscopic tablet computer used for performing fixation disparity measurements in a subject through haploscopic observation of targets, according to the present invention, allows the subject on whom the same measurement is being performed to obtain, in complete ease, the correct positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer, and to maintain this positioning during the same measurement in a simple way, with all the consequences in terms of considerably improving the reliability of the same measurement. Moreover, said process as indicated allows the operator performing the measurement to provide prompt and targeted instructions to the subject on whom the measurement is being performed concerning the correct positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer, and to check that correct positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer is maintained during the measurement. On the other hand, said process as mentioned, makes it easy to attain the correct positioning of the autostereoscopic tablet computer, and subsequently to maintain said correct positioning during performance of the measurement, also for subjects without particular technical knowledge.
