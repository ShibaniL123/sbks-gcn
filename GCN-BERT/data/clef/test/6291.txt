FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compositions and methods for cancer diagnosis. In particular, the present invention relates to recurrent gene fusions as diagnostic markers for prostate cancer. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A central aim in cancer research is to identify altered genes that are causally implicated in oncogenesis. Several types of somatic mutations have been identified including base substitutions, insertions, deletions, translocations, and chromosomal gains and losses, all of which result in altered activity of an oncogene or tumor suppressor gene. First hypothesized in the early 1900's, there is now compelling evidence for a causal role for chromosomal rearrange ments in cancer (Rowley, Nat Rev Cancer 1: 245 (2001)). Recurrent chromosomal aberrations were thought to be primarily characteristic of leukemias, lymphomas, and sarcomas. Epithelial tumors (carcinomas), which are much more common and contribute to a relatively large fraction of the morbidity and mortality associated with human cancer, comprise less than 1% of the known, disease-specific chromosomal rearrangements (Mitelman, Mutat Res 462: 247 (2000)). While hematological malignancies are often characterized by balanced, disease-specific chromosomal rearrangements, most solid tumors have a plethora of non-specific chromosomal aberrations. It is thought that the karyotypic complexity of solid tumors is due to secondary alterations acquired through cancer evolution or progression. Two primary mechanisms of chromosomal rearrangements have been described. In one mechanism, promoter/enhancer elements of one gene are rearranged adjacent to a proto-oncogene, thus causing altered expression of an oncogenic protein. This type of translocation is exemplified by the apposition of immunoglobulin (IG) and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes to MYC leading to activation of this oncogene in B- and T-cell malignancies, respectively (Rabbitts, Nature 372: 143 (1994)). In the second mechanism, rearrangement results in the fusion of two genes, which produces a fusion protein that may have a new function or altered activity. The prototypic example of this translocation is the BCR-ABL gene fusion in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (Rowley, Nature 243: 290 (1973); de Klein et al., Nature 300: 765 (1982)). Importantly, this finding led to the rational development of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), which successfully targets the BCR-ABL kinase (Deininger et al., Blood 105: 2640 (2005)). Thus, identifying recurrent gene rearrangements in common epithelial tumors may have profound implications for cancer drug discovery efforts as well as patient treatment.

DEFINITIONS To facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a number of terms and phrases are defined below: As used herein, the term "gene fusion" refers to a chimeric genomic DNA, a chimeric messenger RNA, a truncated protein or a chimeric protein resulting from the fusion of at least a portion of a first gene to at least a portion of a second gene. The gene fusion need not include entire genes or exons of genes. As used herein, the term "gene upregulated in cancer" refers to a gene that is expressed (e.g., mRNA or protein expression) at a higher level in cancer (e.g., prostate cancer) relative to the level in other tissues. In some aspects, genes upregulated in cancer are expressed at a level at least 10%, preferably at least 25%, even more preferably at least 50%, still more preferably at least 100%, yet more preferably at least 200%, and most preferably at least 300% higher than the level of expression in other tissues. In some aspects, genes upregulated in prostate cancer are "androgen regulated genes." As used herein, the term "gene upregulated in prostate tissue" refers to a gene that is expressed (e.g., mRNA or protein expression) at a higher level in prostate tissue relative to the level in other tissue. In some aspects, genes upregulated in prostate tissue are expressed at a level at least 10%, preferably at least 25%, even more preferably at least 50%, still more preferably at least 100%, yet more preferably at least 200%, and most preferably at least 300% higher than the level of expression in other tissues. In some aspects, genes upregulated in prostate tissue are exclusively expressed in prostate tissue. As used herein, the term "transcriptional regulatory region" refers to the region of a gene comprising sequences that modulate (e.g., upregulate or downregulate) expression of the gene. In some embodiments, the transcriptional regulatory region of a gene comprises non-coding upstream sequence of a gene, also called the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). In other embodiments, the transcriptional regulatory region contains sequences located within the coding region of a gene or within an intron (e.g., enhancers). As used herein, the term "androgen regulated gene" refers to a gene or portion of a gene whose expression is induced or repressed by an androgen (e.g., testosterone). The promoter region of an androgen regulated gene may contain an "androgen response element" that interacts with androgens or androgen signaling molecules (e.g., downstream signaling molecules). As used herein, the terms "detect", "detecting" or "detection" may describe either the general act of discovering or discerning or the specific observation of a detectably labeled composition. As used herein, the term "stage of cancer" refers to a qualitative or quantitative assessment of the level of advancement of a cancer. Criteria used to determine the stage of a cancer include, but are not limited to, the size of the tumor and the extent of metastases (e.g., localized or distant). As used herein, the term "nucleic acid molecule" refers to any nucleic acid containing molecule, including but not limited to, DNA or RNA. The term encompasses sequences that include any of the known base analogs of DNA and RNA including, but not limited to, 4-acetylcytosine, 8-hydroxy-N6-methyladenosine, aziridinylcytosine, pseudoisocytosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl) uracil, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, 5-carboxymethyl-aminomethyluracil, dihydrouracil, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenine, 1-methyladenine, 1-methylpseudouracil, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2-dimethylguanine, 2-methyladenine, 2-methylguanine, 3-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N6-methyladenine, 7-methylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyluracil, 5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5'-methoxycarbonylmethyluracil, 5-methoxyuracil, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid, oxybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, N-uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, and 2,6-diaminopurine. The term "gene" refers to a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) sequence that comprises coding sequences necessary for the production of a polypeptide, precursor, or RNA (e.g., rRNA, tRNA). The polypeptide can be encoded by a full length coding sequence or by any portion of the coding sequence so long as the desired activity or functional properties (e.g., enzymatic activity, ligand binding, signal transduction, immunogenicity, etc.) of the full-length or fragment are retained. The term also encompasses the coding region of a structural gene and the sequences located adjacent to the coding region on both the 5' and 3' ends for a distance of about 1 kb or more on either end such that the gene corresponds to the length of the full-length mRNA. Sequences located 5' of the coding region and present on the mRNA are referred to as 5' non-translated sequences. Sequences located 3' or downstream of the coding region and present on the mRNA are referred to as 3' non-translated sequences. The term "gene" encompasses both cDNA and genomic forms of a gene. A genomic form or clone of a gene contains the coding region interrupted with non-coding sequences termed "introns" or "intervening regions" or "intervening sequences." Introns are segments of a gene that are transcribed into nuclear RNA (hnRNA); introns may contain regulatory elements such as enhancers. Introns are removed or "spliced out" from the nuclear or primary transcript; introns therefore are absent in the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. The mRNA functions during translation to specify the sequence or order of amino acids in a nascent polypeptide. As used herein, the term "oligonucleotide," refers to a short length of single-stranded polynucleotide chain. Oligonucleotides are typically less than 200 residues long (e.g., between 15 and 100), however, as used herein, the term is also intended to encompass longer polynucleotide chains. Oligonucleotides are often referred to by their length. For example a 24 residue oligonucleotide is referred to as a "24-mer". Oligonucleotides can form secondary and tertiary structures by self-hybridizing or by hybridizing to other polynucleotides. Such structures can include, but are not limited to, duplexes, hairpins, cruciforms, bends, and triplexes. As used herein, the term "probe" refers to an oligonucleotide (i.e., a sequence of nucleotides), whether occurring naturally as in a purified restriction digest or produced synthetically, recombinantly or by PCR amplification, that is capable of hybridizing to at least a portion of another oligonucleotide of interest. A probe may be single-stranded or double-stranded. Probes are useful in the detection, identification and isolation of particular gene sequences. It is contemplated that any probe used in the present invention will be labeled with any "reporter molecule," so that is detectable in any detection system, including, but not limited to enzyme (e.g., ELISA, as well as enzyme-based histochemical assays), fluorescent, radioactive, and luminescent systems. It is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular detection system or label. The term "isolated" when used in relation to a nucleic acid, as in "an isolated oligonucleotide" or "isolated polynucleotide" refers to a nucleic acid sequence that is identified and separated from at least one component or contaminant with which it is ordinarily associated in its natural source. Isolated nucleic acid is such present in a form or setting that is different from that in which it is found in nature. In contrast, non-isolated nucleic acids as nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA found in the state they exist in nature. For example, a given DNA sequence (e.g., a gene) is found on the host cell chromosome in proximity to neighboring genes; RNA sequences, such as a specific mRNA sequence encoding a specific protein, are found in the cell as a mixture with numerous other mRNAs that encode a multitude of proteins. However, isolated nucleic acid encoding a given protein includes, by way of example, such nucleic acid in cells ordinarily expressing the given protein where the nucleic acid is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells, or is otherwise flanked by a different nucleic acid sequence than that found in nature. The isolated nucleic acid, oligonucleotide, or polynucleotide maybe present in single-stranded or double-stranded form. When an isolated nucleic acid, oligonucleotide or polynucleotide is to be utilized to express a protein, the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide will contain at a minimum the sense or coding strand (i.e., the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may be single-stranded), but may contain both the sense and anti-sense strands (i.e., the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may be double-stranded). As used herein, the term "purified" or "to purify" refers to the removal of components (e.g., contaminants) from a sample. For example, antibodies are purified by removal of contaminating non-immunoglobulin proteins; they are also purified by the removal of immunoglobulin that does not bind to the target molecule. The removal of non-immunoglobulin proteins and/or the removal of immunoglobulins that do not bind to the target molecule results in an increase in the percent of target-reactive immunoglobulins in the sample. In another example, recombinant polypeptides are expressed in bacterial host cells and the polypeptides are purified by the removal of host cell proteins; the percent of recombinant polypeptides is thereby increased in the sample. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based on the discovery of recurrent gene fusions in prostate cancer. The present invention provides diagnostic, research, and therapeutic methods that either directly or indirectly detect or target the gene fusions. The present invention also provides compositions for diagnostic, research, and therapeutic purposes. I. Gene Fusions The present invention identifies recurrent gene fusions indicative of prostate cancer. The recurrent gene fusions have use as diagnostic markers and clinical targets for prostate cancer. The present invention relates to a fusion of a 5' portion from a transcriptional regulatory region of an SLC45A3 gene and a 3' portion from a RAF family gene that is BRAF. A. Androgen Regulated Genes Genes regulated by androgenic hormones are of critical importance for the normal physiological function of the human prostate gland. They also contribute to the development and progression of prostate carcinoma. Recognized ARGs include, but are not limited to: TMPRSS2; SLC45A3; HERV-K_22q11.23; C15ORF21; FLJ35294; CANT1; PSA; PSMA; KLK2; SNRK; Seladin-1; and, FKBP51 (Paoloni-Giacobino et al., Genomics 44: 309 (1997); Velasco et al., Endocrinology 145(8): 3913 (2004)). TMPRSS2 (NM_005656) has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in prostate epithelium relative to other normal human tissues (Lin et al., Cancer Research 59: 4180 (1999)). The TMPRSS2 gene is located on chromosome 21. This gene is located at 41,750,797 - 41,801,948 bp from the pter (51,151 total bp; minus strand orientation). The human TMPRSS2 protein sequence may be found at GenBank accession no. AAC51784 (Swiss Protein accession no. 015393) and the corresponding cDNA at GenBank accession no. U75329 (see also, Paoloni-Giacobino, et al., Genomics 44: 309 (1997)). SLC45A3, also known as prostein or P501S, has been shown to be exclusively expressed in normal prostate and prostate cancer at both the transcript and protein level (Kalos et al., Prostate 60, 246-56 (2004); Xu et al., Cancer Res 61, 1563-8 (2001)). HERV-K_22q11.23, by EST analysis and massively parallel sequencing, was found to be the second most strongly expressed member of the HERV-K family of human endogenous retroviral elements and was most highly expressed in the prostate compared to other normal tissues (Stauffer et al., Cancer Immun 4, 2 (2004)). While androgen regulation of HERV-K elements has not been described, endogenous retroviral elements have been shown to confer androgen responsiveness to the mouse sex-linked protein gene C4A (Stavenhagen et al., Cell 55, 247-54 (1988)). Other HERV-K family members have been shown to be both highly expressed and estrogen-regulated in breast cancer and breast cancer cell lines (Ono et al., J Virol 61, 2059-62 (1987); Patience et al., J Virol 70, 2654-7 (1996); Wang-Johanning et al., Oncogene 22, 1528-35 (2003)), and sequence from a HERV-K3 element on chromosome 19 was fused to FGFR1 in a case of stem cell myeloproliferative disorder with t(8;19)(p12;q13.3) (Guasch et al., Blood 101, 286-8 (2003)). C15ORF21, also known as D-PCA-2, was originally isolated based on its exclusive overexpression in normal prostate and prostate cancer (Weigle et al., Int J Cancer 109, 882-92 (2004)). FLJ35294 was identified as a member of the "full-length long Japan" (FLJ) collection of sequenced human cDNAs (Nat Genet. 2004 Jan;36(1):40-5. Epub 2003 Dec 21). CANT1, also known as sSCAN1, is a soluble calcium-activated nucleotidase (Arch Biochem Biophys. 2002 Oct 1;406(1):105-15). CANT1 is a 371-amino acid protein. A cleavable signal peptide generates a secreted protein of 333 residues with a predicted core molecular mass of 37,193 Da. Northern analysis identified the transcript in a range of human tissues, including testis, placenta, prostate, and lung. No traditional apyrase-conserved regions or nucleotide-binding domains were identified in this human enzyme, indicating membership in a new family of extracellular nucleotidases. RAF Families The BRAF gene makes a protein called B-RAF, which is involved in sending signals in cells and in cell growth. This gene may be mutated (Davies et al., (2002). Nature 417 (6892): 949-54) in many types of cancer, which causes a change in the B-RAF protein. This can increase the growth and spread of cancer cells. This gene encodes a protein belonging to the raf/mil family of serine/threonine protein kinases. This protein plays a role in regulating the MAP kinase/ERKs signaling pathway, which affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. Mutations in this gene are associated with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, a disease characterized by heart defects, mental retardation and a distinctive facial appearance. Mutations in this gene have also been associated with various cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colorectal cancer, malignant melanoma, thyroid carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma of lung. c-raf is gene that codes for a protein kinase called "Raf-1" here. The Raf-1 protein functions in the MAPK/ERK signal transduction pathway as part of a protein kinase cascade. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine-specific kinase. Raf-1 is a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) which functions downstream of the Ras family of membrane associated GTPases to which it binds directly. Once activated Raf-1 can phosphorylate to activate the dual specificity protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2 which in turn phosphorylate to activate the serine/threonine specific protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2. Activated ERKs are pleiotropic effectors of cell physiology and play an important role in the control of gene expression involved in the cell division cycle, apoptosis, cell differentiation and cell migration. The first raf gene that was found was the oncogene v-raf (Mark et al., (April 1984). Science 224 (4646): 285-9). Normal (non-oncogenic) cellular homologs of v-raf were soon found to be conserved components of eukaryotic genomes and it was shown that they could mutate and become oncogenes (Shimizu et al., (1986). Int. Symp. Princess Takamatsu Cancer Res. Fund 17: 85-91). A-Raf and B-Raf are two protein kinases with similar sequences to Raf-1. Mutations in B-Raf genes are found in several types of cancer. The Raf kinases are targets for anticancer drug development (Sridhar et al., (April 2005). Mol. Cancer Ther. 4 (4): 677-85). There are several quantitative immunochemical methods available to detect Raf kinase inhibiting drugs (Olive (October 2004). Expert Rev Proteomics 1 (3): 327-41). Human BRAF DNA has the nucleotide sequence described by Genbank Accession No. NG_007873. Human BRAF mRNA has the nucleotide sequence described by Genbank Accession No. NM_004333.

The antibodies may be polyclonal or monoclonal, chimeric, humanized, single chain or Fab fragments. Various procedures known to those of ordinary skill in the art may be used for the production and labeling of such antibodies and fragments. See, e.g.,Bums, ed., Immunochemical Protocols, 3rd ed., Humana Press (2005); Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1988); Kozbor et al., Immunology Today 4: 72 (1983); Köhler and Milstein, Nature 256: 495 (1975). Antibodies or fragments exploiting the differences between the truncated ETS family member protein or chimeric protein and their respective native proteins are particularly preferred. III. Diagnostic Applications The gene fusions described herein are detectable as DNA, RNA or protein. Initially, the gene fusion is detectable as a chromosomal rearrangement of genomic DNA having a 5' portion from a first gene and a 3' portion from a RAF family member gene. Once transcribed, the gene fusion is detectable as a chimeric mRNA having a 5' portion from a first gene and a 3' portion from a RAF family member gene. Once translated, the gene fusion is detectable as fusion of a 5' portion from a first protein and a 3' portion from a RAF family member protein or a truncated version of a first protein or a RAF family member. The truncated or fusion proteins may differ from their respective native proteins in amino acid sequence, post-translational processing and/or secondary, tertiary or quaternary structures Such differences, if present, can be used to identify the presence of the gene fusion. Specific methods of detection are described in more detail below. The present invention provides DNA, RNA and protein based diagnostic methods that either directly or indirectly detect the gene fusions. The present invention also provides compositions and kits for diagnostic purposes. The diagnostic methods of the present invention may be qualitative or quantitative. Quantitative diagnostic methods may be used, for example, to discriminate between indolent and aggressive cancers via a cutoff or threshold level. Where applicable, qualitative or quantitative diagnostic methods may also include amplification of target, signal or intermediary (e.g., a universal primer). An initial assay may confirm the presence of a gene fusion but not identify the specific fusion. A secondary assay is then performed to determine the identity of the particular fusion, if desired. The second assay may use a different detection technology than the initial assay. The gene fusions of the present invention may be detected along with other markers in a multiplex or panel format. Markers are selected for their predictive value alone or in combination with the gene fusions. Exemplary prostate cancer markers include, but are not limited to: AMACR/P504S (U.S. Pat. No. 6,262,245); PCA3 (U.S. Pat. No. 7,008,765); PCGEM1 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,828,429); prostein/P501S, P503S, P504S, P509S, P510S, prostase/P703P, P710P (U.S. Publication No. 20030185830); and, those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,854,206 and 6,034,218, and U.S. Publication No. 20030175736. Markers for other cancers, diseases, infections, and metabolic conditions are also contemplated for inclusion in a multiplex or panel format. The diagnostic methods of the present invention may also be modified with reference to data correlating particular gene fusions with the stage, aggressiveness or progression of the disease or the presence or risk of metastasis. Ultimately, the information provided by the methods of the present invention will assist a physician in choosing the best course of treatment for a particular patient. A. Sample Any patient sample suspected of containing the gene fusions may be tested according to the methods of the present invention. By way of non-limiting examples, the sample may be tissue (e.g., a prostate biopsy sample or a tissue sample obtained by prostatectomy), blood, urine, semen, prostatic secretions or a fraction thereof (e.g., plasma, serum, urine supernatant, urine cell pellet or prostate cells). A urine sample is preferably collected immediately following an attentive digital rectal examination (DRE), which causes prostate cells from the prostate gland to shed into the urinary tract. The patient sample typically requires preliminary processing designed to isolate or enrich the sample for the gene fusions or cells that contain the gene fusions. A variety of techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art may be used for this purpose, including but not limited to: centrifugation; immunocapture; cell lysis; and, nucleic acid target capture (See, e.g., EP Pat. No. 1 409 727). B. DLYA and RNA Detection The gene fusions of the present invention may be detected as chromosomal rearrangements of genomic DNA or chimeric mRNA using a variety of nucleic acid techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including but not limited to: nucleic acid sequencing; nucleic acid hybridization; and, nucleic acid amplification. 1. Sequencing Illustrative non-limiting examples of nucleic acid sequencing techniques include, but are not limited to, chain terminator (Sanger) sequencing and dye terminator sequencing. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that because RNA is less stable in the cell and more prone to nuclease attack experimentally RNA is usually reverse transcribed to DNA before sequencing. Chain terminator sequencing uses sequence-specific termination of a DNA synthesis reaction using modified nucleotide substrates. Extension is initiated at a specific site on the template DNA by using a short radioactive, or other labeled, oligonucleotide primer complementary to the template at that region. The oligonucleotide primer is extended using a DNA polymerase, standard four deoxynucleotide bases, and a low concentration of one chain terminating nucleotide, most commonly a di-deoxynucleotide. This reaction is repeated in four separate tubes with each of the bases taking turns as the di-deoxynucleotide. Limited incorporation of the chain terminating nucleotide by the DNA polymerase results in a series of related DNA fragments that are terminated only at positions where that particular di-deoxynucleotide is used. For each reaction tube, the fragments are size-separated by electrophoresis in a slab polyacrylamide gel or a capillary tube filled with a viscous polymer. The sequence is determined by reading which lane produces a visualized mark from the labeled primer as you scan from the top of the gel to the bottom. Dye terminator sequencing alternatively labels the terminators. Complete sequencing can be performed in a single reaction by labeling each of the di-deoxynucleotide chain-terminators with a separate fluorescent dye, which fluoresces at a different wavelength. 2. Hybridization Illustrative non-limiting examples of nucleic acid hybridization techniques include, but are not limited to, in situ hybridization (ISH), microarray, and Southern or Northern blot. In situ hybridization (ISH) is a type of hybridization that uses a labeled complementary DNA or RNA strand as a probe to localize a specific DNA or RNA sequence in a portion or section of tissue (in situ), or, if the tissue is small enough, the entire tissue (whole mount ISH). DNA ISH can be used to determine the structure of chromosomes. RNA ISH is used to measure and localize mRNAs and other transcripts within tissue sections or whole mounts. Sample cells and tissues are usually treated to fix the target transcripts in place and to increase access of the probe. The probe hybridizes to the target sequence at elevated temperature, and then the excess probe is washed away. The probe that was labeled with either radio-, fluorescent- or antigen-labeled bases is localized and quantitated in the tissue using either autoradiography, fluorescence microscopy or immunohistochemistry, respectively. ISH can also use two or more probes, labeled with radioactivity or the other non-radioactive labels, to simultaneously detect two or more transcripts. a. FISH In some aspects, fusion sequences are detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The preferred FISH assays for the present disclosure utilize bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). These have been used extensively in the human genome sequencing project (see Nature 409: 953-958 (2001)) and clones containing specific BACs are available through distributors that can be located through many sources, e.g., NCBI. Each BAC clone from the human genome has been given a reference name that unambiguously identifies it. These names can be used to find a corresponding GenBank sequence and to order copies of the clone from a distributor. The present disclosure further provides a method of performing a FISH assay on human prostate cells, human prostate tissue or on the fluid surrounding said human prostate cells or human prostate tissue. b. Microarrays Different kinds of biological assays are called microarrays including, but not limited to: DNA microarrays (e.g., cDNA microarrays and oligonucleotide microarrays); protein microarrays; tissue microarrays; transfection or cell microarrays; chemical compound microarrays; and, antibody microarrays. A DNA microarray, commonly known as gene chip, DNA chip, or biochip, is a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface (e.g., glass, plastic or silicon chip) forming an array for the purpose of expression profiling or monitoring expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously. The affixed DNA segments are known as probes, thousands of which can be used in a single DNA microarray. Microarrays can be used to identify disease genes by comparing gene expression in disease and normal cells. Microarrays can be fabricated using a variety of technologies, including but not limiting: printing with fine-pointed pins onto glass slides; photolithography using pre-made masks; photolithography using dynamic micromirror devices; inkjet printing; or, electrochemistry on microelectrode arrays. Southern and Northern blotting is used to detect specific DNA or RNA sequences, respectively. DNA or RNA extracted from a sample is fragmented, electrophoretically separated on a matrix gel, and transferred to a membrane filter. The filter bound DNA or RNA is subject to hybridization with a labeled probe complementary to the sequence of interest. Hybridized probe bound to the filter is detected. A variant of the procedure is the reverse Northern blot, in which the substrate nucleic acid that is affixed to the membrane is a collection of isolated DNA fragments and the probe is RNA extracted from a tissue and labeled. 3. Amplification Chromosomal rearrangements of genomic DNA and chimeric mRNA may be amplified prior to or simultaneous with detection. Illustrative non-limiting examples of nucleic acid amplification techniques include, but are not limited to, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), ligase chain reaction (LCR), strand displacement amplification (SDA), and nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA). Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that certain amplification techniques (e.g., PCR) require that RNA be reversed transcribed to DNA prior to amplification (e.g., RT-PCR), whereas other amplification techniques directly amplify RNA (e.g., TMA and NASBA). The polymerase chain reaction (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195, 4,683,202, 4,800,159 and 4,965,188), commonly referred to as PCR, uses multiple cycles of denaturation, annealing of primer pairs to opposite strands, and primer extension to exponentially increase copy numbers of a target nucleic acid sequence. In a variation called RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase (RT) is used to make a complementary DNA (cDNA) from mRNA, and the cDNA is then amplified by PCR to produce multiple copies of DNA. For other various permutations of PCR see, e.g.,U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195, 4,683,202 and 4,800,159; Mullis et al., Meth. Enzymol. 155: 335 (1987); and, Murakawa et al., DNA 7: 287 (1988). Transcription mediated amplification (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,480,784 and 5,399,491), commonly referred to as TMA, synthesizes multiple copies of a target nucleic acid sequence autocatalytically under conditions of substantially constant temperature, ionic strength, and pH in which multiple RNA copies of the target sequence autocatalytically generate additional copies. See, e.g.,U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,399,491 and 5,824,518. In a variation described in U.S. Publ. No. 20060046265), TMA optionally incorporates the use of blocking moieties, terminating moieties, and other modifying moieties to improve TMA process sensitivity and accuracy. The ligase chain reaction (Weiss, R., Science 254: 1292 (1991)), commonly referred to as LCR, uses two sets of complementary DNA oligonucleotides that hybridize to adjacent regions of the target nucleic acid. The DNA oligonucleotides are covalently linked by a DNA ligase in repeated cycles of thermal denaturation, hybridization and ligation to produce a detectable double-stranded ligated oligonucleotide product. Strand displacement amplification (Walker, G. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 392-396 (1992); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,270,184 and 5,455,166), commonly referred to as SDA, uses cycles of annealing pairs of primer sequences to opposite strands of a target sequence, primer extension in the presence of a dNTPaS to produce a duplex hemiphosphorothioated primer extension product, endonuclease-mediated nicking of a hemimodified restriction endonuclease recognition site, and polymerase-mediated primer extension from the 3' end of the nick to displace an existing strand and produce a strand for the next round of primer annealing, nicking and strand displacement, resulting in geometric amplification of product. Thermophilic SDA (tSDA) uses thermophilic endonucleases and polymerases at higher temperatures in essentially the same method (EP Pat. No. 0 684 315). Other amplification methods include, for example: nucleic acid sequence based amplification (U.S. Pat. No. 5,130,238), commonly referred to as NASBA; one that uses an RNA replicase to amplify the probe molecule itself (Lizardi et al., BioTechnol. 6: 1197 (1988)), commonly referred to as Qβ replicase; a transcription based amplification method (Kwoh et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:1173 (1989)); and, self-sustained sequence replication (Guatelli et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 1874 (1990)). For further discussion of known amplification methods see Persing, David H., "In Vitro Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques" in Diagnostic Medical Microbiology: Principles and Applications (Persing et al., Eds.), pp. 51-87 (American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC (1993)). 4. Detection Methods Non-amplified or amplified gene fusion nucleic acids can be detected by any conventional means. For example, the gene fusions can be detected by hybridization with a detectably labeled probe and measurement of the resulting hybrids. Illustrative non-limiting examples of detection methods are described below. One illustrative detection method, the Hybridization Protection Assay (HPA) involves hybridizing a chemiluminescent oligonucleotide probe (e.g., an acridinium ester-labeled (AE) probe) to the target sequence, selectively hydrolyzing the chemiluminescent label present on unhybridized probe, and measuring the chemiluminescence produced from the remaining probe in a luminometer. See, e.g.,U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,174 and Norman C. Nelson et al., Nonisotopic Probing, Blotting, and Sequencing, ch. 17 (Larry J. Kricka ed., 2d ed. 1995). Another illustrative detection method provides for quantitative evaluation of the amplification process in real-time. Evaluation of an amplification process in "real-time" involves determining the amount of amplicon in the reaction mixture either continuously or periodically during the amplification reaction, and using the determined values to calculate the amount of target sequence initially present in the sample. A variety of methods for determining the amount of initial target sequence present in a sample based on real-time amplification are well known in the art. These include methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,303,305 and 6,541,205. Another method for determining the quantity of target sequence initially present in a sample, but which is not based on a real-time amplification, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.,5,710,029. Amplification products may be detected in real-time through the use of various self-hybridizing probes, most of which have a stem-loop structure. Such self-hybridizing probes are labeled so that they emit differently detectable signals, depending on whether the probes are in a self-hybridized state or an altered state through hybridization to a target sequence. By way of non-limiting example, "molecular torches" are a type of self-hybridizing probe that includes distinct regions of self-complementarity (referred to as "the target binding domain" and "the target closing domain") which are connected by a joining region (e.g., non-nucleotide linker) and which hybridize to each other under predetermined hybridization assay conditions. In a preferred aspect, molecular torches contain single-stranded base regions in the target binding domain that are from 1 to about 20 bases in length and are accessible for hybridization to a target sequence present in an amplification reaction under strand displacement conditions. Under strand displacement conditions, hybridization of the two complementary regions, which may be fully or partially complementary, of the molecular torch is favored, except in the presence of the target sequence, which will bind to the single-stranded region present in the target binding domain and displace all or a portion of the target closing domain. The target binding domain and the target closing domain of a molecular torch include a detectable label or a pair of interacting labels (e.g., luminescent/quencher) positioned so that a different signal is produced when the molecular torch is self-hybridized than when the molecular torch is hybridized to the target sequence, thereby permitting detection of probe:target duplexes in a test sample in the presence of unhybridized molecular torches. Molecular torches and a variety of types of interacting label pairs are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,534,274. Another example of a detection probe having self-complementarity is a "molecular beacon." Molecular beacons include nucleic acid molecules having a target complementary sequence, an affinity pair (or nucleic acid arms) holding the probe in a closed conformation in the absence of a target sequence present in an amplification reaction, and a label pair that interacts when the probe is in a closed conformation. Hybridization of the target sequence and the target complementary sequence separates the members of the affinity pair, thereby shifting the probe to an open conformation. The shift to the open conformation is detectable due to reduced interaction of the label pair, which may be, for example, a fluorophore and a quencher (e.g., DABCYL and EDANS). Molecular beacons are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,925,517 and 6,150,097. Other self-hybridizing probes are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. By way of non-limiting example, probe-binding pairs having interacting labels, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,928,862 might be adapted for use in the present invention. Probe systems used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) might also be utilized in the present invention. Additional detection systems include "molecular switches," as disclosed in U.S. Publ. No. 20050042638. Other probes, such as those comprising intercalating dyes and/or fluorochromes, are also useful for detection of amplification products in the present disclosure. See, e.g.,U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,447 C. Protein Detection The gene fusions of the present invention may be detected as truncated or chimeric proteins using a variety of protein techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including but not limited to: protein sequencing; and, immunoassays. 1. Sequencing Illustrative non-limiting examples of protein sequencing techniques include, but are not limited to, mass spectrometry and Edman degradation. Mass spectrometry can, in principle, sequence any size protein but becomes computationally more difficult as size increases. A protein is digested by an endoprotease, and the resulting solution is passed through a high pressure liquid chromatography column. At the end of this column, the solution is sprayed out of a narrow nozzle charged to a high positive potential into the mass spectrometer. The charge on the droplets causes them to fragment until only single ions remain. The peptides are then fragmented and the mass-charge ratios of the fragments measured. The mass spectrum is analyzed by computer and often compared against a database of previously sequenced proteins in order to determine the sequences of the fragments. The process is then repeated with a different digestion enzyme, and the overlaps in sequences are used to construct a sequence for the protein. In the Edman degradation reaction, the peptide to be sequenced is adsorbed onto a solid surface (e.g., a glass fiber coated with polybrene). The Edman reagent, phenylisothiocyanate (PTC), is added to the adsorbed peptide, together with a mildly basic buffer solution of 12% trimethylamine, and reacts with the amine group of the N-terminal amino acid. The terminal amino acid derivative can then be selectively detached by the addition of anhydrous acid. The derivative isomerizes to give a substituted phenylthiohydantoin, which can be washed off and identified by chromatography, and the cycle can be repeated. The efficiency of each step is about 98%, which allows about 50 amino acids to be reliably determined. 2. Immunoassays Illustrative non-limiting examples of immunoassays include, but are not limited to: immunoprecipitation; Western blot; ELISA; immunohistochemistry; immunocytochemistry; flow cytometry; and, immuno-PCR. Polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies detectably labeled using various techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., colorimetric, fluorescent, chemiluminescent or radioactive) are suitable for use in the immunoassays. Immunoprecipitation is the technique of precipitating an antigen out of solution using an antibody specific to that antigen. The process can be used to identify protein complexes present in cell extracts by targeting a protein believed to be in the complex. The complexes are brought out of solution by insoluble antibody-binding proteins isolated initially from bacteria, such as Protein A and Protein G. The antibodies can also be coupled to sepharose beads that can easily be isolated out of solution. After washing, the precipitate can be analyzed using mass spectrometry, Western blotting, or any number of other methods for identifying constituents in the complex. A Western blot, or immunoblot, is a method to detect protein in a given sample of tissue homogenate or extract. It uses gel electrophoresis to separate denatured proteins by mass. The proteins are then transferred out of the gel and onto a membrane, typically polyvinyldiflroride or nitrocellulose, where they are probed using antibodies specific to the protein of interest. As a result, researchers can examine the amount of protein in a given sample and compare levels between several groups. An ELISA, short for Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay, is a biochemical technique to detect the presence of an antibody or an antigen in a sample. It utilizes a minimum of two antibodies, one of which is specific to the antigen and the other of which is coupled to an enzyme. The second antibody will cause a chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate to produce a signal. Variations of ELISA include sandwich ELISA, competitive ELISA, and ELISPOT. Because the ELISA can be performed to evaluate either the presence of antigen or the presence of antibody in a sample, it is a useful tool both for determining serum antibody concentrations and also for detecting the presence of antigen. Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry refer to the process of localizing proteins in a tissue section or cell, respectively, via the principle of antigens in tissue or cells binding to their respective antibodies. Visualization is enabled by tagging the antibody with color producing or fluorescent tags. Typical examples of color tags include, but are not limited to, horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. Typical examples of fluorophore tags include, but are not limited to, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or phycoerythrin (PE). Flow cytometry is a technique for counting, examining and sorting microscopic particles suspended in a stream of fluid. It allows simultaneous multiparametric analysis of the physical and/or chemical characteristics of single cells flowing through an optical/electronic detection apparatus. A beam of light (e.g., a laser) of a single frequency or color is directed onto a hydrodynamically focused stream of fluid. A number of detectors are aimed at the point where the stream passes through the light beam; one in line with the light beam (Forward Scatter or FSC) and several perpendicular to it (Side Scatter (SSC) and one or more fluorescent detectors). Each suspended particle passing through the beam scatters the light in some way, and fluorescent chemicals in the particle may be excited into emitting light at a lower frequency than the light source. The combination of scattered and fluorescent light is picked up by the detectors, and by analyzing fluctuations in brightness at each detector, one for each fluorescent emission peak, it is possible to deduce various facts about the physical and chemical structure of each individual particle. FSC correlates with the cell volume and SSC correlates with the density or inner complexity of the particle (e.g., shape of the nucleus, the amount and type of cytoplasmic granules or the membrane roughness). Immuno-polymerase chain reaction (IPCR) utilizes nucleic acid amplification techniques to increase signal generation in antibody-based immunoassays. Because no protein equivalence of PCR exists, that is, proteins cannot be replicated in the same manner that nucleic acid is replicated during PCR, the only way to increase detection sensitivity is by signal amplification. The target proteins are bound to antibodies which are directly or indirectly conjugated to oligonucleotides. Unbound antibodies are washed away and the remaining bound antibodies have their oligonucleotides amplified. Protein detection occurs via detection of amplified oligonucleotides using standard nucleic acid detection methods, including real-time methods. D. Data Analysis In some aspects, a computer-based analysis program is used to translate the raw data generated by the detection assay (e.g., the presence, absence, or amount of a given gene fusion or other markers) into data of predictive value for a clinician. The clinician can access the predictive data using any suitable means. Thus, in some preferred aspects, the present disclosure provides the further benefit that the clinician, who is not likely to be trained in genetics or molecular biology, need not understand the raw data. The data is presented directly to the clinician in its most useful form. The clinician is then able to immediately utilize the information in order to optimize the care of the subject. The present disclosure contemplates any method capable of receiving, processing, and transmitting the information to and from laboratories conducting the assays, information provides, medical personal, and subjects. For example, in some aspects, a sample (e.g., a biopsy or a serum or urine sample) is obtained from a subject and submitted to a profiling service (e.g., clinical lab at a medical facility, genomic profiling business, etc.), located in any part of the world (e.g., in a country different than the country where the subject resides or where the information is ultimately used) to generate raw data. Where the sample comprises a tissue or other biological sample, the subject may visit a medical center to have the sample obtained and sent to the profiling center, or subjects may collect the sample themselves (e.g., a urine sample) and directly send it to a profiling center. Where the sample comprises previously determined biological information, the information may be directly sent to the profiling service by the subject (e.g., an information card containing the information may be scanned by a computer and the data transmitted to a computer of the profiling center using an electronic communication systems). Once received by the profiling service, the sample is processed and a profile is produced (i.e., expression data), specific for the diagnostic or prognostic information desired for the subject. The profile data is then prepared in a format suitable for interpretation by a treating clinician. For example, rather than providing raw expression data, the prepared format may represent a diagnosis or risk assessment (e.g., likelihood of cancer being present) for the subject, along with recommendations for particular treatment options. The data may be displayed to the clinician by any suitable method. For example, the profiling service generates a report that can be printed for the clinician (e.g., at the point of care) or displayed to the clinician on a computer monitor. In some aspects, the information is first analyzed at the point of care or at a regional facility. The raw data is then sent to a central processing facility for further analysis and/or to convert the raw data to information useful for a clinician or patient. The central processing facility provides the advantage of privacy (all data is stored in a central facility with uniform security protocols), speed, and uniformity of data analysis. The central processing facility can then control the fate of the data following treatment of the subject. For example, using an electronic communication system, the central facility can provide data to the clinician, the subject, or researchers. In some aspects, the subject is able to directly access the data using the electronic communication system. The subject may chose further intervention or counseling based on the results. In some aspects, the data is used for research use. For example, the data may be used to further optimize the inclusion or elimination of markers as useful indicators of a particular condition or stage of disease. E. Compositions & Kits Any of these compositions, alone or in combination with other compositions of the present disclosure, may be provided in the form of a kit. For example, the single labeled probe and pair of amplification oligonucleotides may be provided in a kit for the amplification and detection of gene fusions of the present disclosure. Kits may further comprise appropriate controls and/or detection reagents. The probe and antibody compositions of the present disclosure may also be provided in the form of an array. Compositions for use in the diagnostic methods of the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, probes, amplification oligonucleotides, and antibodies. Particularly preferred compositions detect a product only when an first gene fuses to a RAF family member gene. These compositions include: a single labeled probe comprising a sequence that hybridizes to the junction at which a 5' portion from a first gene fuses to a 3' portion from a RAF family member gene (i.e., spans the gene fusion junction); a pair of amplification oligonucleotides wherein the first amplification oligonucleotide comprises a sequence that hybridizes to a transcriptional regulatory region of a 5' portion from a first gene fuses to a 3' portion from a RAF family member gene; an antibody to an amino-terminally truncated protein resulting from a fusion of a first protein to a RAF family member gene; or, an antibody to a chimeric protein having an amino-terminal portion from a first gene and a carboxy-terminal portion from a RAF family member gene. Other useful compositions, however, include: a pair of labeled probes wherein the first labeled probe comprises a sequence that hybridizes to a transcriptional regulatory region of a first gene and the second labeled probe comprises a sequence that hybridizes to a RAF family member gene. EXPERIMENTAL The following examples are provided in order to demonstrate and further illustrate certain preferred embodiments and aspects of the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting the scope thereof. Subject-matter outside of the claims is for reference. Example 1: RAF Gene Fusions MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning of full length fusion transcript The full length fusion transcript SLC45A3-BRAF and RAF1-ESRP1 were cloned into pCR8/GW/TOPO Entry vector (Invitrogen, USA) by TA cloning method following manufacturer's instructions. The fusion transcripts were later recombined into Gateway pcDNADEST40 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, USA) and into pAd/CMV/V5-DEST Adenoviral expression system (Invitrogen, USA) by LR Clonase II enzyme reaction following manufacturer's instruction. Western Blotting The ESRP1-RAF1 fusion positive prostate cancer tissue and fusion negative tissues were homogenized in NP40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1% NP40, pH 7.4, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase inhibitor (EMD bioscience, San Diego. CA). For testing the expression and assess the molecular weight of the fusion protein in the fusion positive tissues, HEK293 cells were transfected with ESRP1-RAF1 fusion construct (cloned in pDEST40 expression vector - Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) and vector control and lysed in NP40 lysis buffer with protease inhibitor. Fifteen micrograms of each protein extract were boiled in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto Polyvinylidene Difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The membrane was incubated for one hour in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween (TBS-T), 5% nonfat dry milk) and incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-RAF1 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000 in blocking buffer, BD bioscience, San Jose, CA, Cat #: 610151). Following three washes with TBS-T, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the signals visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence system as described by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). The blot was reprobed with anti-beta actin mouse monoclonal (1:5000, Sigma Cat #: A5441) antibodies. Foci Formation Assay Transfections were performed using Fugene 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Sciences). NIH3T3 cells (1.5 X 105) in 35-mm plastic dishes were transfected with 2 µg of DNA of the plasmid of interest. Plasmids for fusion transcripts SLC45A3-Braf, exon8-Braf, exon10-Braf and mutant V600E were used along with control plasmids (pDEST40 and pBABE respectively). Three days after transfection, cells were split into 140-mm dishes containing DMEM with 5% CS (Life Technologies). The cultures were fed every 3-4 days. After 3 weeks, the cells cultured in DMEM with 5% CS were stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 70% ethanol for the visualization of foci, and were counted on colony counter (Oxford Optronix Ltd., Oxford UK, software v4.1, 2003). Foci counts were further confirmed manually. WST-1 assay For each treatment, equal amount of cells were plated into 96-well plates for WST-1 assay, Boyden invasion chambers for invasion assay. WST-1 proliferation assay was performed using manufacturer's protocol (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Invasion assay was performed as described previously (Kleer et al. PNAS 2003, Cao et al. Oncogene 2008). BRAF codon V600E Mutation Detection by Pyrosequencing One to two µg total RNA isolated from fresh frozen localized prostate cancer (n=42), metastatic prostate cancer (n=21) and benign prostate (n=5) tissue samples, and a panel of melanoma (11), pancreatic (8) and breast cancer (8) cell lines was converted into cDNA using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Biotinylated sequencing templates were generated by PCR amplification of a 375 bp fragment spanning the mutation in codon 600 (V600E, Exon 15) of the BRAF gene using primers from PyroMark Q24 BRAF kit (Biotage-Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Ten microliters of the biotinylated PCR products were immobilized on streptavidin coated Sepharose beads (Streptavidin Sepharose High Performance, GE Healthcare) using Pyromark Q24 Vacuum Prep Workstation, followed by removal of non-biotinylated strand by sodium hydroxide denaturation followed by wash in neutralization buffer and 70% ethanol. The single stranded biotinylated templates were then mixed with 0.3 mM sequencing primer and 'sequencing by synthesis' was carried out through dispensation of the query nucleotide sequence using PyroMark Q24 platform, as described before (Edlundh-Rose, Egyhazi et al. Melanoma Res. 16:471 2006; Spittle, Ward et al. J. Mol. Diagn. 9:464 2007). The nucleotide sequence ACAGA/TGAAA (SEQ Id NO:4) for codon 600 was analyzed and visualized by Pyromark Q24 1.0.10 software. A panel of 9 melanoma cell lines (sk-mel-2, sk-mel-5, sk-mel-19, sk-mel-28, sk-mel-29, sk-mel-103, G-361, Malme-3M, mel-1 with known mutation status was used to serve as assay standards. Real Time PCR validation Quantitative PCR (QPCR) was performed using Power SYBR Green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on an Applied Biosystems Step One Plus Real Time PCR System. All oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and are listed in Table 3. The GAPDH primer was used as a control. All assays were performed repeated twice and results were plotted as average fold change relative to GAPDH. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) FISH hybridizations were performed on tumor cells using prostate cancer tissue microarray (TMA) and individual sections. BAC clones were selected from UCSC genome browser and purchased through BACPAC resources (Children's Hospital, Oakland, CA). Following colony purification midi prep DNA was prepared using QiagenTips-100 (Qiagen, USA). DNA was labeled by nick translation method with biotin-16-dUTP and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche, USA). Probe DNA was precipitated and dissolved in hybridization mixture containing 50% formamide, 2XSSC, 10% dextran sulphate, and 1% Denhardts solution. About 200ng of labeled probes was hybridized to normal human chromosomes to confirm the map position of each BAC clone. FISH signals were obtained using anti digoxigenin-fluorescein and alexa fluor594 conjugate to obtain green and red colors respectively. Fluorescence images were captured using a high resolution CCD camera controlled by ISIS image processing software (Metasystems, Germany). RESULTS The SLC45A3-BRAF fusion transcript is predicted to transcribe exon 8 (highlighted in Figure 10) onwards, and therefore also contains the kinase domain of BRAF Figure 11 shows paired end transcriptome discovery of the inter-chromosomal gene fusion transcript SLC45A1-BRAF.

The individual signals indicate the normal chromosomes 1 and 7 (SLC45A3 and BRAF) in PCA3 and chromosomes 8 and 3 (ESRP1 and RAF1) in PCA17. The co localizing signals (arrow) indicate the fusion event detected using BAC clones from the 5' and 3' end of the 5' and 3' partner genes, respectively. Tumor PCA3 show two copies of the rearranged chromosome. Figure 2(e) shows Western blot analysis showing the expression of 120kDa ESRP1-RAF1 fusion protein in PCA17 and in HEK293 cells transfected with ESRP1-RAF1 full length fusion construct cloned from PCA17.

NIH3T3 cells transfected with the indicated constructs were assessed for focus forming ability. Representative plate shown for each sample and quantification of foci formation is shown in the bar graph (b) from two independent experiments. Figure 3c shows that SLC45A3-BRAF fusion promotes cell proliferation and invasion. WST-1 assay was performed at indicated time points and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Error bars representing s.e.m. P-values were calculated by t-test compared with pDEST40 control stable cells. Figure 3(d) shows RWPE stable cells treated with 0.25 µM Sorafenib or DMSO control, and WST-1 assay was performed at indicated time. Error bars represent s.e.m. P-values were calculated by t-test compared with DMSO treated cells. Figure 4 shows the exon structure of BRAF (A) and RAF1 (B) normal and fusion transcripts. The kinase domain is retained in both BRAF and RAF1 fusion genes. The SLC45A3-BRAF fusion results in the expression of a truncated BRAF gene retaining the entire kinase domain. The ESRP1-RAF1 fusion, a 4.2 kb fusion transcript with an open reading frame of 1060 aa was expressed resulting in the formation of a 120kDa fusion. Figure 5 shows genomic organization and FISH validation of BRAF and RAF1 gene rearrangement. Schematic diagrams in the top panel of (a) and (b) show the genomic location of SLC45A3 and BRAF and ESRP1 and RAF1 genes respectively.

Figure 6 shows RNA-seq exon coverage of BRAF in normal sample (NOR9) and index case (PCA3). Exons are shown at the bottom in alternating shades of grey. Bars highlight the nucleotide coverage across the exons. Figure 7 shows ETV1 and BRAF RNA-Seq outlier expression profiles. Samples are categorized as benign or tumor prostate samples. Tumor samples are further classified into ETS-samples and ETV1+ samples Figure 8 shows a comparison of the foci frequencies of NIH3T3 cells expressing fusion transcript SLC45A3-Braf, BRAF Ex8-stop and BRAF Ex10-stop and pDEST40 vector. Foci densities of NIH3T3 cells expressing fusion transcripts SLC45A3-BRAF, BRAF Ex8-stop, BRAF Ex10-stop and vector control (pDEST40) were evaluated using colony counter (Oxford Optronix Ltd., Oxford UK, software v4.1, 2003). Values for minimum colony radius and maximum colony radius were set at 0.10 mm and 2.75 mm respectively, while minimum colony density was fixed at 0.15 optical densities (OD). The bar diagram show frequencies of foci on y-axis falling on the range (0.01 to 0.65 OD) of optical densities on x-axis. Figure 9 shows representative Pyrograms showing the BRAF V600E mutation status (shaded grey).

The top Pyrogram represents wild type (T/T), middle mutant/ wildtype (A/T), and bottom (A/A) genotype. Example 2: RAS gene Fusions A. Materials and Methods Analysis of array CGH/SNP datasets for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and prostate cancer For Affymetrix SNP arrays, model-based expression was performed to summarize signal intensities for each probe set, using the perfect-match/mismatch (PM/MM) model. For copy number inference, raw copy numbers were calculated for each tumor sample by comparing the summarized signal intensity of each SNP probe set against a diploid reference set of samples. In Agilent two channel array CGH dataset, the differential ratio between the processed testing channel signal and processed reference channel signal was calculated. All resulting relative DNA copy number data were log2 transformed, which reflects the DNA copy number difference between the testing and reference samples. To improve the accuracy of copy number estimation, a reference set normalization method was employed. For each sample, non-sex chromosomes were split into 30Mb region units. The absolute mean of the relative DNA copy number data for the probes from each region was calculated and compared with the other regions. The probes from two regions with minimal absolute mean in each sample were picked up as an internal reference set, representing the chromosomal regions with minimal DNA copy number aberrations. For each sample, log ratios were transformed into a normal distribution with a mean of 0, under the null model assumption for the reference probe set. The normalization method was implemented by perl programming. Amplification breakpoints rating and assembling (ABRA) ABRA analysis has three steps. First, the copy number data from the array CGH or array SNP datasets were segmented by the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm (Karnoub et al., Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 9, 517 (Jul, 2008)). The level of amplification was determined by comparing the relative copy number data of the amplifications with the neighboring segments, and the breakpoints having equal to or more than 2 copies number gain were selected (≥0.75). Amplifications spanning more than 500kb are included in the analysis. The genomic position of each amplification breakpoint was mapped with the genomic regions of all human genes. The genomic region of each human gene was designated as the starting of the transcript variant most approaching the 5' of the gene, and the end of the variant most approaching the 3' of the gene. The partially amplified genes were classified into candidate 5' and 3' partners based on the association of amplification breakpoints with gene placements. 5' amplified genes are considered as 5' partners, 3' amplified genes as 3' partners. Second, the partially amplified "cancer genes" were identified as driver fusion gene candidates. This was achieved by mapping 3' amplified genes to known cancer genes defined by cancer gene census. To evaluate the relevance of partially amplified genes underlying cancer, the "concept signature technology" (ConSig) method (Moul et al., Prostate 20, 327 (1992)), which can preferentially identify biologically meaningful genes based on their association with the "molecular concepts" frequently found in known cancer genes was used. This score is especially discriminative for 3' fusion genes (Moul et al., supra). The 3' amplified genes with acceptable breakpoints (see below criteria, Fig. 20A) were rated by their radial concept signature scores (in brief ConSig Score). The top scored 3' amplified cancer genes were considered as driver fusion gene candidates. Third, the level of amplification for the selected 3' amplified gene was matched with 5' amplified genes from the same cell line to nominate putative 5' partners. The actual location and the quality of the breakpoint were manually curated with the un-segmented relative quantification of DNA copy number data. The situations when the amplification breakpoint is not acceptable are (Fig. 20): (1) Multiple intragenic breakpoints;(2) The candidate is not the gene closest to the amplification breakpoint;(3) The amplification starts from existing copy number increase and the breakpoint is not sharp;(4) The breakpoint locates at the centromere or the end of the chromosome;(5) The breakpoint is the result of a small deletion within an amplification; and(6) The breakpoint is found in a majority of samples. It is possible that the segmentation process could have slightly different estimation of the breakpoints from the actual location. This is relevant to breakpoint assembling. To overcome this problem, the DNA breakpoints within 10 kb up and 1kb downstream region of a gene were assigned to this gene during breakpoint ranking; and 20kb up- and downstream during breakpoint assembling. In practice, this window can be adjusted to improve the performance of ABRA analysis. In total, six 5' amplified genes were found on K-562, 4 matched the 3' amplification level of ABL1. After curation, only 2 genes BCR and NUP214 had acceptable breakpoints. On DU145, eight and six 5' amplified genes were found from the two replicate hybridizations respectively (Table 4). After curation, UBE2L3-KRAS, SOX5-KRAS, and C14orf166-KRAS were selected for experimental validation. Pimers were then designed from the first exon of candidate 5' partners and last exon of candidate 3' partners, as well as the exons next to the breakpoints, to test the putative fusions. Cell lines and Tissues The benign immortalized prostate cell line RWPE, prostate cancer cell line DU145, PC3, Ca-HPV-10, WPE1-NB26 and NCI-H660, Fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3, and human embryonic kidney cell line HEK were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Primary benign prostatic epithelial cells (PrEC) were obtained from Cambrex Bio Science (Walkersville, MD). VCaP was derived from a vertebral metastasis from a patient with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer (Seeburg et al., Nature 312, 71 (Nov 1-7, 1984)). Tissues were from the radical prostatectomy series at the University of Michigan and from the Rapid Autopsy Program, which are both part of University of Michigan Prostate Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence (S.P.O.R.E.) Tissue Core. Tissues were also obtained from a radical prostatectomy series at the University Hospital Ulm (Ulm, Germany). All samples were collected with informed consent of the patients and prior institutional review board approval at each institution. A pool of benign prostate tissue total RNA was obtained from Clontech laboratories (Mountain View, CA). Total RNA from all samples was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. RNA integrity was verified by Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Microarray comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) To nominate potential driver gene fusions in prostate cancer cell lines, ten prostate cancer cell lines were profiled on an Agilent-014698 Human Genome CGH Microarray 105A (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), including 22RV1, C4-2B, CA-hpv-10, DU145, LAPC4, MDAPCa-2b, NCI660, PC3, VCaP, and WPE1-NB26. All cell lines were grown in full serum in accordance with the distributor's instructions. The genomic DNA extracted from those cell lines were hybridized against reference human male genomic DNA (6 normal individuals, Promega, #G1471) to oligonucleotide printed in the array format according to manufacture's protocol. Analysis of fluorescent intensity for each probe detected the copy number changes in cancer cell lines relative to normal reference genome (Genome build 2004). Replicate array CGH hybridizations of DU145 were done to nominate 5' partners of KRAS. Paired-end transcriptome sequencing and analysis DU145 mRNA samples were prepared for sequencing using the mRNA-seq sample prep kit (Illumina) following manufacturers protocols. The raw sequencing image data were analyzed by the Illumina analysis pipeline, aligned to the unmasked human reference genome (NCBI v36, hg18) using the ELAND software (Illumina). The paired reads were then analyzed as previously described to nominate mate-pair chimeras (Schubbert, K. Shannon, G. Bollag, Nat Rev Cancer 7, 295 (Apr, 2007)). Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing Complimentary DNA was synthesized from one microgram of total RNA, using SuperScript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in presence of random primers. The reaction was carried out for 60 minutes at 50°C and the cDNA was purified using microcon YM-30 (Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA, USA) according to manufacturer's instruction and used as template in PCRs. All oligonucleotide primers used in this study were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and are listed in Table 10. Polymerase chain reaction was performed with Platinum Taq High Fidelity and fusion-specific primers for 35 cycles. Products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels, and bands were excised, purified and TOPO TA cloned into pCR 4-TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Purified plasmid DNA from at least 4 colonies was sequenced bidirectionally using M13 Reverse and M13 Forward primers on an ABI Model 3730 automated sequencer at the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the StepOne Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Briefly, reactions were performed with SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) cDNA template and 25 ng of both the forward and reverse fusion primers using the manufacturer recommended thermocycling conditions. For each experiment, threshold levels were set during the exponential phase of the QPCR reaction using the StepOne software. The amount of each target gene relative to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) for each sample was determined using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method (Applied Biosystems User Bulletin #2). For the experiments presented in Fig. 16b, the relative amount of the target gene was calibrated to the relative amount from a benign prostate. For a subset of cell lines and tissue samples, qPCR was performed using the Taqman probe CAGCAACCAAAACC (SEQ ID NO:40). Samples with RQ value≥10 by fusion qPCR were considered fusion positive. RNA ligase mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) RNA ligase mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using the GeneRacer RLM-RACE kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The prostate cell line DU145 and tissue samples PCA1-3 and MET10 that had high UBE2L3-KRAS expression levels by qPCR were selected for 5' RACE. Briefly, two micrograms of total RNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove 5' phosphates from truncated mRNA and non-mRNA and decapped with tobacco acid phyrophosphatase. The GeneRacer RNA Oligo was ligated to full length transcripts and reverse transcribed using SuperScript III. To obtain 5' ends, first-strand cDNA was amplified with Platinum Taq High Fidelity (Invitrogen) using the GeneRacer 5' and KRAS R2 primer pairs. Nested PCR was then performed with GeneRacer 5' nested Primer and KRAS R3 or R4 primers. Products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels and bands were excised, purified and sequenced as described above. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) To evaluate the fusion of UBE2L3 with KRAS, a two-color, two-signal FISH strategy was employed, with probes spanning the respective gene loci. The digoxin-dUTP labeled BAC clone RP11-317J15 was used for the UBE2L3 locus and the biotin-14-dCTP BAC clone RP11-608F13 was used for the KRAS locus. To detect possible translocations at KRAS locus, a break-apart FISH strategy was used, with two probes spanning the KRAS locus (digoxin-dUTP labeled BAC clone RP11-68I23, (5' KRAS) and biotin-14-dCTP labeled BAC clone RP11-157L6 (3' KRAS)). All BAC clones were obtained from the Children's Hospital of Oakland Research Institute (CHORI). Prior to FISH analysis, the integrity and purity of all probes were verified by hybridization to metaphase spreads of normal peripheral lymphocytes. For interphase FISH on DU145 cells, interphase spreads were prepared using standard cytogenetic techniques. For interphase FISH on a series of prostate cancer tissue microarrays, tissue hybridization, washing and color detection were performed as described (Tomlins et al., Science 310, 644 (Oct 28, 2005); Kumar-Sinha et al., Nat Rev Cancer 8, 497 (Jul, 2008)). The total evaluable cases include 78 PCAs and 29 METs for KRAS split probes, and 67 PCAs and 18 METs for UBE2L3/KRAS fusion probes. For evaluation of the interphase FISH on the TMA, an average of 50-100 cells per case were evaluated for assessment of the KRAS rearrangement and UBE2L3/KRAS fusion. In addition, formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from five fusion positive cases were used to confirm the negative FISH results. Western Blotting The prostate cancer cell lines DU145 were transfected with siRNA duplex (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA) against UBE2L3 (5'-CCACCGAAGATCACATTTA-3'; SEQ ID NO:1), KRAS (5'-GAAGTTATGGAATTCCTTT-3'; SEQ ID NO:2) or the fusion junction (5'-CCGACCAAGGCCTGCTGAA-3'; SEQ ID NO:3) by oligofectamine (Invitrogen). DU145 transfected with non-targeting siRNA and RWPE cells was used as negative control. Post 48 hours transfection, cells were homogenized in NP40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1% NP40, pH 7.4, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Ten micrograms of each protein extract were boiled in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto Polyvinylidene Difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The membrane was incubated for one hour in blocking buffer [Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween (TBS-T), 5% nonfat dry milk] and incubated overnight at 4°C with the following antibodies: anti-RAS mouse monoclonal (1:1000 in blocking buffer, Millipore Cat #: 05-516), anti-KRAS rabbit polyclonal (1:1000, Proteintech Group Inc., Cat #: 12063-1-AP) and anti-beta Actin mouse monoclonal (1:5000, Sigma Cat #: A5441) antibodies. Following three washes with TBS-T, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the signals visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence system as described by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). To test fusion protein expression in multiple prostate derived cell lines, lysates from DU145, PrEC, RWPE, 22RV1, VCaP, PC3 either untreated or treated with 500 nM bortezomib for 12 hours were used. Bortezomib treated HEK cells over-expressing UBE2L3-KRAS fusion protein was used as a positive control. To explore the activation of MAPK signaling pathways, protein lysates from NIH 3T3 stable cell lines expressing UBE2L3-KRAS, V600E mutant BRAF, G12V mutant KRAS, and vector controls were probed with phospho MEK1/2, phospho p38 MAPK, phospho Akt, and equal loading was demonstrated by probing for the respective total proteins and beta Actin. For ERK activation analysis NIH 3T3 cells were starved for 12 hours before immunoblot analysis using phospho erk1/2 antibody. All antibodies for the MAPK signaling proteins were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Multiple Reactions Monitoring Mass Spectrometry Du145 and LnCaP cells were grown to 70% confluence and treated with bortezomib. After 24 hours, cells were harvested and whole cell protein lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) with the addition of protease inhibitor complete mini cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and separated by SDS PAGE (Novex, 18 % Tris-Glycine, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 12 equal sized bands from 15-40 kDa regions were excised for in-gel trypsin digestion. Lyophilized peptides from each gel slice were re-suspended in 3 % acetonitrille, 0.1 % formic acid containing 25 fmol of each stably isotopically labeled peptide internal standards (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO, USA). Peptides were then separated and measured by CHIP HPLC-multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS). Three transitions for each stably isotopically labeled internal standard and three transitions for endogenous peptides were measured. An overlap of all 6 transitions for each peptide in retention time indicated a positive measurement. In vitro overexpression of the UBE2L3-KRAS chimera Expression plasmids for UBE2L3-KRAS were generated with the pDEST40 (with or without 5' FLAG) and pLenti-6 vectors (without 5'FLAG). NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10%FBS and transfected with either the pDEST40 vector plasmid or pDEST40 containing the UBE2L3-KRAS open reading frame using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). After three days, transfected cells were selected using 500 µg/ml Geneticin. After three weeks of selection stable cell lines were established for both the vector and UBE2L3-KRAS fusion, and were used for further analyses. Constructs for the G12V mutant KRAS (Addgene plasmid 9052), V600E mutant BRAF (Addgene plasmid 15269), and their respective pBABE-puro vector (Addgene plasmid 1764) were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA). These plasmid constructs were transfected in NIH 3T3 cells maintained in 10% calf serum and stable lines were generated using puromycin 1 µg/ml for selection. These stable cell lines were used as controls for immunoblot analysis of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathways. To overexpress UBE2L3-KRAS fusion in the prostate derived normal cell lines, RWPE cells were transfected with lentiviral particles expressing the UBE2L3-KRAS open reading frame or the pLenti-6 vector. Three days after infection, the cells were subject to 3 µg/ml blasticidin selection. After three weeks of selection individual clones were picked up and propagated for further analysis. Both the NIH 3T3 and the RWPE overexpression models were tested for UBE2L3-KRAS fusion by qPCR (Fig. 25 B,C) and Western blotting. Cell proliferation assay For cell proliferation analysis, 10,000 cells of NIH 3T3 expressing UBE2L3-KRAS fusion or the vector were plated on 24 well plates in duplicate wells and cell counts were performed using a Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) at the indicated times. Similar assays were performed using RWPE stable clones expressing UBE2L3-KRAS fusion or vector. Both cell proliferation assays were performed twice and data from representative assays are presented. Basement Membrane Matrix Invasion assay 100,000 cells of RWPE clones expressing UBE2L3-KRAS fusion or pLenti-6 vector were seeded onto a matrigel precoated plate (BD Biosciences) and processed as the manufacturer's recommendation. After 48 hours the inserts were stained with crystal violet. Destaining was carried out using 10% acetic acid, and the invasion was quantitated by comparing the absorbance at 560 nm. DU145 was used as a positive control for the invasion assay. Foci Formation Assay Transfections were performed using Fugene 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Sciences). NIH 3T3 cells (1.5×105) in 35-mm plastic dishes were transfected with 2 µg of DNA of the plasmid of interest. Plasmids for fusion transcript UBE2L3-KRAS and oncogenic KRAS G12V were used along with control plasmids (pDEST40 and pBABE respectively). Three days after transfection, cells were split into one 140-mm dishes containing DMEM with 5% calf serum (Colorado Serum Company). The cultures were fed every 3-4 days. After 3 weeks, the cells were stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 70% ethanol for the visualization of foci, and were counted on colony counter (Oxford Optronix Ltd., Oxford UK, software v4.1, 2003). Counts were further confirmed manually. FACS Cell Cycle Analysis Propidium iodide-stained stable NIH 3T3 cells expressing the UBE2L3-KRAS fusion or vector were analyzed on a LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) running FACSDivia, and cell cycle phases were calculated using ModFit LT (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). NIH 3T3 and RWPE -UBE2L3-KRAS Xenograft Model Four week old male Balb C nu/nu mice were purchased from Charles River, Inc. (Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA). Stable NIH 3T3 and RWPE cells over expressing fusion transcript UBE2L3-KRAS or NIH 3T3-Vector (2 × 106 cells) were resuspended in 100 µl of saline with 20% Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Becton Drive, NJ) and were implanted subcutaneously into the left or both left and right flank regions of the mice. Mice were anesthetized using a cocktail of xylazine (80-120 mg/kg IP) and ketamine (10 mg/kg IP) for chemical restraint before implantation. Eight mice were included in each group. Growth in tumor volume was recorded everyday by using digital calipers and tumor volumes were calculated using the formula (π/6) (L × W2), where L = length of tumor and W = width. All procedures involving mice were approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA) at the University of Michigan and conform to their relevant regulatory standards. RESULTS Using an integrative genomics approach called Amplification Breakpoint Ranking and Assembly (ABRA) analysis KRAS was nominated as a gene fusion with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2L3 in DU145 prostate cancer cells. expression of the UBE2L3-KRAS chimeric transcript was validated in DU145 cells and in 42 out of 112 prostate cancer tissues (38%). The UBE2L3-KRAS fusion protein is relatively unstable and requires proteosomal inhibition to be observed easily. Overexpression of the UBE2L3-KRAS fusion induces an oncogenic phenotype in NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells and RWPE prostate epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to the canonical KRAS G12V mutation, the UBE2L3-KRAS fusion attenuates MEK and ERK signaling in NIH 3T3 cells and instead leads to activation of AKT and p38 MAP Kinase, both of which are implicated in prostate cancer progression. RAS proteins play a critical role in cellular physiology, development and tumorigenesis (Karnoub et al., Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 9, 517 (Jul, 2008); Rodriguez-Viciana et al., Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol 70, 461 (2005)). Mutations in RAS have been identified in a wide spectrum of cancers (Karnoub et al., supra), but rarely in prostate cancer (Moul et al., Prostate 20, 327 (1992)). To date, oncogenic alterations in the RAS pathway have been exclusively restricted to activating point mutations including the most commonly studied being the Gly-to-Val substitution of HRAS (Seeburg et al., Nature 312, 71 (Nov 1-7, 1984)) and substitutions in codons 12, 13 or 61 of KRAS (Karnoub et al., supra; Schubbert, K. Shannon, G. Bollag, Nat Rev Cancer 7, 295 (Apr, 2007)). Chimeric transcripts of RAS genes have not been described as a class of cancer-related mutations. In previous studies, recurrent gene fusions characterized by 5' genomic regulatory elements, most commonly controlled by androgen, fused to members of the ETS family of transcription factors were identified and found to be present in over 60-70% of prostate cancers (Tomlins et al., Science 310, 644 (Oct 28, 2005); Kumar-Sinha et al., Nat Rev Cancer 8, 497 (Jul, 2008)). In this study, integrative bioinformatics approaches were employed to study genomic patterns characteristic of gene fusions in cancers. This led to the characterization of a recurrent chimeric transcript of UBE2L3 fused to KRAS in a subset of human prostate cancers. To understand the characteristic features of recurrent gene fusions in cancer, a large-scale integrative analysis of multi-dimensional genomic data related to human cancers was carried out. This analysis revealed that in many instances, a small subset of tumors or cancer cell lines harboring a recurrent gene fusion, often display characteristic amplification at the site of genomic rearrangement (Mullighan et al., Nature 453, 110 (May 1, 2008); Graux et al., Nat Genet 36, 1084 (Oct, 2004); Barr et al., Hum Mol Genet 5, 15 (Jan, 1996); Ferreira et al., Oncogene 27, 2084 (Mar 27, 2008); Koivunen et al., Clin Cancer Res 14, 4275 (Jul 1, 2008)) (Fig. 15A). The amplification usually affected a portion of the fusion gene, and is generally considered a secondary genetic lesion associated with disease progression, drug resistance, and poor prognosis (Mullighan et al., supra; Barr et al., supra; Ferreira et al., supra; Koivunen et al., supra; Stergianou et al., Leukemia 19, 1680 (Sep, 2005); Attard et al., Oncogene 27, 253 (Jan 10, 2008)). In contrast, high level copy number changes that result in the marked over-expression of oncogenes usually encompass the target genes at the center of overlapping amplifications across a panel of tumor samples. Thus, a "partially" amplified cancer gene may indicate that this gene participates in a genomic fusion event important in cancer progression. Moreover, based on the integrative analysis carried out, amplifications associated with gene fusions usually involve the 5' region of 5' partners, and 3' region of 3' partners. This observation provided the rationale to assemble putative gene fusions from amplification breakpoints by matching the amplification levels of candidate 5' and 3' partners. In order to nominate partially amplified gene fusions systematically from genomic data, ABRA was employed across a compendium of data from cancer cell lines (the workflow is described in Fig. 19). Experiments were performed on cancer cell lines initially, as breakpoint analyses are more reliable in uniform cellular populations as opposed to tumors which are made up of multiple cell types many of which are not malignant. The ABRA approach was first tested on a published single polymorphism microarray (aSNP) dataset (Mullighan et al., supra) generated from 36 leukemia cell lines including the K-562 chronic myeloid leukemia cell line known to harbor the amplified BCR-ABL1 fusion (Wu et al., Leukemia 9, 858 (May, 1995)). The relative DNA copy number data was determined and all 5' and 3' amplified genes from the 36 cell lines (≥2 copies) were identified. In this data set ABL1 was the top ranking gene with a 3' copy number increase (Fig. 15B, left panel, Table 4). The amplification levels of all 5' amplified genes in K-562 were then matched with ABL1 to nominate potential 5' partners. In total, six 5' amplified genes were found in K-562 and five matched the level of ABL1 3' amplification. After curation of the amplification breakpoints, BCR and NUP214 were nominated as ABL1 fusion partner candidates (Fig. 15B, right panel). See methods and Fig. 20A, B for the criteria of candidate selection. This analysis demonstrated the feasibility of this method in nominating driver gene fusions from genomic datasets. To nominate novel gene fusions in prostate cancer, this method was applied to an array of comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of ten prostate cancer cell lines (Table 5). The top candidate nominated in the DU145 prostate cancer cell line was KRAS exhibiting a clear breakpoint accompanied by a 3' amplification of KRAS (Fig. 15C, left). The activation of downstream signaling intermediaries of the RAS-MAPK pathway have been observed in prostate cancer by a number of studies (Graff et al., J Biol Chem 275, 24500 (Aug 11, 2000); Xu et al., Oncogene 25, 2987 (May 18,2006)). To assemble amplification breakpoints in the KRAS gene, replicate array CGH hybridizations for DU145 was performed. Matching the amplification level of KRAS with the 5' amplified genes from DU145 cells identified ten potential 5' partner candidates that were indicated by either of the two array CGH hybridizations. After curation, C14orf166, SOX5 and UBE2L3 were left as the top 5' partner candidates for KRAS (Fig. 15C, right), based on the criteria detailed in Fig. 20C. To experimentally validate the predicted fusions of C14orf166-KRAS, SOX5-KRAS and UBE2L3-KRAS, primer pairs were designed from the first exons of candidate 5' partners and last exon of KRAS, as well as the exons next to the breakpoints. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of DU145 cells identified a specific fusion band for UBE2L3-KRAS but not for the others. Subsequent sequencing of the RT-PCR product confirmed the fusion of the UBE2L3 exon 3 to the KRAS exon 2 which is schematically depicted in Fig. 16A. To assess the expression pattern of the UBE2L3-KRAS chimera, a panel of prostate cell lines and tissues was analyzed by SYBR green quantitative PCR (QPCR) as well as Taqman QPCR. In the context of cell lines, UBE2L3-KRAS expression was restricted to DU145 cells and not expressed in the other 5 prostate cell lines tested (Fig. 16B, Fig. 21). In the panel of prostate tissues from the University of Michigan Prostate SPORE program and the University of Ulm, 14 out of 36 prostate cancers (PCA), and 10 out of 16 metastatic prostate cancers (MET) exhibited elevated expression of UBE2L3-KRAS using SYBR green assays (Fig. 16B). None of the benign adjacent prostates displayed expression of this chimera. These results were further corroborated using an independently designed Taqman assay (Fig. 21) on a subset of the samples. Mutual exclusivity with the ETS gene fusions described earlier (Table 7) was not observed, indicating that the UBE2L3-KRAS chimera can co-exist in a tumor harboring an ETS gene fusion. Conventional RT-PCR using primers from the first exon of UBE2L3 and the last exon of KRAS generated expected size products in prostate cancer samples determined to be UBE2L3-KRAS positive by QRT-PCR (Fig. 16C). Wild-type UBE2L3 and KRAS were expressed equally across the cohort (Fig. 16C). Subsequent sequencing of cloned RT-PCR products from three fusion positive tissues revealed the same fusion transcripts as isolated from DU145 cells (Fig. 23). Moreover, mutation analysis of these sequences did not reveal alterations in the fusion allele of KRAS (Fig. 23). The prevalence of the UBE2L3-KRAS chimera was tested on a second independent cohort of prostate cancers from Weill Cornell Medical College and the fusion transcript was detected in 18 out of 60 samples (Table 8). The products were sequenced for confirmation. Similar to the other cohorts examined, prostate cancers expressing the UBE2L3-KRAS chimera were not mutually exclusive with the presence of ETS gene fusions. To address the tissue specificity of the UBE2L3-KRAS fusion, a cohort of cancers not of prostatic origin was examined. Analysis of 36 breast cancer tissues, and 9 melanoma cell lines by qPCR did not detect the chimeric transcript, highlighting the prostate cancer specificity of UBE2L3-KRAS (Table 7). To characterize the 5' end of the fusion transcript, 5' RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) was performed priming from exon 2 of KRAS using DU145 cells and four UBE2L3-KRAS positive prostate cancer tissues (Fig. 22). This confirmed the presence of UBE2L3 at the 5' end of the fusion transcript in DU145 and 3 prostate cancer samples. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 296 amino acids extending from UBE2L3 to KRAS (Fig. 16A). To compare the relative expression level of the UBE2L3-KRAS transcript with other putative chimeras, paired-end transcriptome sequencing was performed on DU145 cells. Similar to BCR-ABL in K-562 cells and TMPRSS2-ERG in VCaP cells (Fig. 16D) (Maher et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci US A (Jul 10, 2009)), the UBE2L3-KRAS chimera was amongst the top chimeric sequences in DU145 cells demonstrating biological relevance (Fig. 16D-E). Transcriptome sequencing also identified C14orf166-SLC25A1 as the top most chimera found in DU145 cells (Fig. 16D, right panel), both of which were nominated as putative 5' and 3' fusion genes respectively by ABRA (Tables 5-6). Moreover, transcriptome sequencing data from K-562 cells not only detected the BCR-ABL chimera but the second most abundant chimera in this cell line was NUP214-XKR3 (Fig. 16D, left panel). NUP214 was also nominated as a 5' fusion partner in K562 cells by the ABRA approach (Fig. 15B, right panel). To determine whether the UBE2L3-KRAS chimera can be attributable to a DNA based rearrangement, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed. By both KRAS split probe and UBE2L3-KRAS fusion probe FISH analysis, DU145 clearly showed a rearrangement at the KRAS genomic loci and fusion with UBE2L3 (Fig. 16F, Fig 24B). In addition, low level amplification (3 copies) of the UBE2L3-KRAS fusion was observed, consistent with its nomination by the ABRA approach. To extend these findings into prostate tissue, FISH analysis of a series of prostate cancer tissue micorarrays, which included 67 PCAs and 18 METs, was performed. Gene rearrangements were not obversved in the KRAS locus; nor was fusion of UBE2L3 to KRAS observed (Table 11, Fig. 24C). Three index cases from Weill Cornell Medical College were assayed by FISH with KRAS split probes and no rearrangement was found (Table 8). This result, which is discordant from that observed in DU145 cells, indicates that prostate tumors express the UBE2L3-KRAS transcript, which is not attributable to a DNA based fusion analogous to the SLC45A3-ELK4 chimeric transcripts found in prostate cancer (Rickman et al., Cancer Res 69, 2734 (Apr 1, 2009); Maher et al., Nature 458, 97 (Mar 5, 2009)). Similarly, Sklar and colleagues identified the recurrent JJAZ1-SUZ12 chimera which is expressed at the mRNA level in endometrial stromal cells that appears to get "locked in" as a DNA based gene fusion in endometrial stromal tumors (Wang et al., Science 321, 1357 (Sep 5, 2008)). Thus, DU145 prostate cancer cells could have been derived from a prostate cancer expressing the UBE2L3-KRAS transcript in which expression of the chimera is locked into place by genomic rearrangements picked up in cell culture. Expression of the UBE2L3-KRAS protein was next examined. The predicted 296 amino acids fusion protein trims 17 amino acids from the C-terminus of UBE2L3 (Fig. 17A). The full length KRAS protein is preserved, with a 4 amino acid insertion between UBE2L3 and KRAS. Using both a monoclonal antibody raised against RAS and a polyclonal antibody raised against KRAS, a 33 kDa fusion protein was detected in addition to the 21 kDa band corresponding to wild-type KRAS (Fig. 17B,C). Specificity of the band attributed to the UBE2L3-KRAS protein was shown by knocking down expression using RNA interference against KRAS, UBE2L3 and the chimeric junction of UBE2L3-KRAS (Fig. 17B, Fig. 25A). The UBE2L3-KRAS protein was found specifically in DU145 cell and not in a panel of other prostate cell lines (Fig. 17C). Specific expression of the protein was also independently confirmed by mass spectrometric assessment of DU145 cells using a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assay (Fig. 17D). While wild-type KRAS and UBE2L3 were detected in DU145, VCaP and LNCaP cells, UBE2L3-KRAS was only detected in DU145 cells. Over-expression of an expression construct encoding UBE2L3-KRAS in HEK293 cells did not show protein expression (Fig. 17C). In the presence of the proteosomal inhibitor, bortezomib, expression of the fusion protein was clearly apparent indicating decreased stability of the fusion protein. Incubation of DU145 cells with bortezomib also enhanced the levels of UBE2L3-KRAS protein expression (Fig. 17C). To determine the function of the UBE2L3-KRAS protein, it was over-expressed in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 25B), a system classically used to study RAS biology (Seeburg et al., supra; Der et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 79, 3637 (Jun, 1982)). Enforced expression of UBE2L3-KRAS induced loss of fibroblast morphology (Fig. 26) and increased cell proliferation (Fig. 18A) and foci formation (Fig. 18B, Fig. 27). Cell cycle analysis revealed an increase in the S phase fraction of cells (Fig. 28). To interrogate the potential RAS-related signaling pathways engaged by UBE2L3-KRAS in NIH 3T3 cells a series of immunoblot analyses was performed on key signaling intermediaries (Fig. 29). As reported in the literature for NIH 3T3 cells, KRAS is a stronger inducer of the MEK/ERK cascade; whereas HRAS is a stronger activator of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Zhu et al., J Biol Chem 279, 37398 (Sep 3, 2004)). UBE2L3-KRAS over-expression attenuated endogenous MEK and ERK phosphorylation indicating a potential dominant negative effect of the chimeric product on RAS signaling (Fig. 18C). Furthermore, not only was there an attenuation of MEK-ERK signaling by the UBE2L3-KRAS fusion, but a shift to AKT and p38 MAP Kinase activation was observed, pathways which have been implicated in prostate cancer by a number of studies (Graff et al., supra; Xu et al., supra). To determine the effects of UBE2L3-KRAS expression on tumor growth in vivo, nude mice were implanted with the stable NIH 3T3 vector control cells or NIH 3T3 UBE2L3-KRAS chimera expressing cells. Tumor formation was observed in the UBE2L3-KRAS expressing cells but not the vector transfected cells (Fig. 18D, Fig. 30). To investigate the role of the UBE2L3-KRAS chimera in a prostate background, the fusion was overexpressed in RWPE prostate epithelial cells (Fig. 25C). In order to observe expression of the fusion protein, proteosomal inhibition with bortezomib was required (Fig. 18E, insert), indicating that the fusion protein is highly unstable. Overexpression of the UBE2L3-KRAS chimera in RWPE cells led to increased cellular proliferation, cell invasion and a transient increase of tumor growth in nude mice (Fig. 18E-G). Unlike NIH 3T3 xenografts, RWPE xenografts overexpressing UBE2L3-KRAS exhibited tumor regression over several weeks indicating that in the RWPE system, additional alterations are required to maintain tumor growth longer term. In summary, this example describes an integrative bioinformatics approach to understand common characteristics of recurrent gene fusions in cancer using a compilation of published genomic datasets matched with gene rearrangement data. This led to the nomination of the UBE2L3-KRAS chimera in the DU145 prostate cancer cell line. This genomic fusion was experimentally confirmed to exist at the RNA and DNA level in DU145 cells. In prostate tumors it was found that the UBE2L3-KRAS chimeric transcript is highly expressed in 30-40% of prostate cancers (from 3 independent cohorts, Table 9) but is undectectable or at low levels in benign adjacent tissues or in other cancer types. DNA based alteration was not detected in prostate cancer tissues that accounts for the creation of this chimeric transcript, indicating that altered splicing mechanisms may be a prerequisite for the generation of a genomic fusion. This is analogous to the altered splicing mechanisms described for the JJAZ1-SUZ12 chimera in endometrial stromal tissues (Wang et al., supra). It was determined that the UBE2L3-KRAS chimera can co-exist with ETS gene fusions in prostate cancer. The UBE2L3-KRAS chimera encodes a protein in which the N-terminus encompasses most of the UBE2L3 protein with a small truncation in frame with full length KRAS. This fusion protein is unstable and requires proteosomal inhibition to be observed readily. UBE2L3 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) (Moynihan et al., Genomics 51, 124 (Jul 1, 1998)). Furthermore, there is already considerable evidence that ubiquitination pathways are important in tumorigenesis (Hoeller et al., Nature 458, 438 (Mar 26, 2009)). While a number of oncogenic activating point mutations of KRAS have been identified, this is the first description of a mutant chimeric version of KRAS that is oncogenic and thus represents a new class of cancer-related alteration. As activating point mutations in KRAS are rare in prostate cancer, the UBE2L3-KRAS chimera also represents the KRAS alteration specific to prostate cancer as there are a number of studies supporting the role of KRAS and MAPK pathways in prostate cancer progression (Graff et al., supra; Chen et al., supra). Both KRAS G12V and UBE2L3-KRAS exhibit an oncogenic phenotype in vitro and in vivo, UBE2L3-KRAS over-expression leads to attenuation, rather than activation, of the MEK-ERK pathway. Instead, the KRAS fusion directs signaling down the AKT and p38 MAPK pathways.
