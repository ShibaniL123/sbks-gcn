Intermediate 12: 1,2-Diamino-5-iodo-3-methylpyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate
To a cooled (0° C.) solution of ethyl (1E)-N-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)sulfonyloxyethanimidate (0.732 g, 2.56 mmol) in dioxane (3.2 mL) was added 70% perchloric acid (2.75 mL, 32.2 mmol) dropwise. Following the addition, the temperature was maintained at 0° C. for 10 minutes and then ice-cold water (13 mL) was added at once. The resulting precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration and washed with water (caution: this compound has been reported to be potentially explosive when dry). The white solid was immediately dissolved in DCM (5.5 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and filtered. The filtrate was then added dropwise to a cooled (0° C.) solution of 5-iodo-3-methylpyridin-2-amine (0.3 g, 1.28 mmol) in DCM (11 mL). The reaction was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 3.5 h. Diethyl ether was added and the resulting white solid was collected by vacuum filtration to provide the title compound (517 mg, 89%).
