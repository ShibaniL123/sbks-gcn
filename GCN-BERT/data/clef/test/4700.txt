Example 7. (R)-3-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)-N-phenylpyrrolidine-1-carboxamide
70.0 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 5-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 1.00 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 0.0350 mL of phenyl isocyanate was added thereto, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0590 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine, and then stirred at room temperature for about 5 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 81.5 mg of (R)-3-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)-N-phenylpyrrolidine-1-carboxamide was obtained with a yield of about 75.4%.
