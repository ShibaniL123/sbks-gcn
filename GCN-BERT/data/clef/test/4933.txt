FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for cracking hydrocarbon oils. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Processes for cracking hydrocarbon oils generally comprise contacting and reacting a hydrocarbon oil with a cracking catalyst in a cracking zone under cracking conditions, separating cracked products and the catalyst, circulating the catalyst to a regeneration zone to regenerate the catalyst and circulating at least a part of the regenerated catalyst back to the cracking zone. The object of regenerating the catalyst is to maintain the cracking activity of the catalyst. Some hydrocarbon oils contain impurities, such as nickel, vanadium, iron and the like. If impurities contained in the hydrocarbon oil, such as nickel, vanadium, iron and the like, are deposited onto the catalyst containing a molecular sieve, the catalyst will thus be deactivated and the distribution of cracked products will be affected. In order to solve this problem, a reduction zone is added in some processes for cracking hydrocarbon oils. U.S. Pat. No. 4,345,992 discloses a process for cracking hydrocarbon oils. The process comprises, under cracking conditions, contacting an olefin oil with a catalytic cracking catalyst in the form of particles in a cracking zone; continuously transferring part of said cracking catalyst to a regeneration zone, removing the carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst in the regeneration zone by combustion, continuously transferring the regenerated catalyst to a reduction zone, contacting said catalyst with a reducing gas in the reduction zone under reduction conditions that enable the adverse effects of the metal impurities to be reduced, using a gaseous seal at the upstream of the reduction zone to assure that the major portion of the unconsumed reducing gas passes into the cracking zone, continuously transferring the reduced catalyst to the cracking zone. Said catalyst includes conventional cracking catalysts, such as zeolite-containing catalysts and amorphous aluminosilicate catalyst. U.S. Pat. No. 4,623,443 discloses a process for hydrogenation of olefins. The process comprises cracking a hydrocarbon with a regenerated catalyst having a metal coat under cracking conditions in a cracking zone; transferring continuously said catalyst to a regeneration zone, contacting said catalyst with an oxygen-containing gas to regenerate said catalyst; transferring continuously a part of the regenerated catalyst to said cracking zone; meanwhile, transferring the other part of the regenerated catalyst to a reduction zone where said catalyst contacts with a reducing gas under conditions in which metals on the catalyst are reduced; transferring the cracked hydrocarbon to a separation zone where hydrogen and olefins are separated from the cracked products; contacting at least a part of said hydrogen and olefins with the reduced catalyst in a hydrogenation zone to hydrogenate the olefins; and finally transferring said catalyst to the regeneration zone. U.S. Pat. No. 4,623,443 further discloses a process for continuous hydrogenation of olefins. The process comprises, under regeneration conditions, contacting a deactivated and metal-contaminated cracking catalyst with an oxygen-containing gas to obtain a regenerated and metal-contaminated catalyst; contacting the regenerated and metal-contaminated catalyst with a reducing gas under reduction conditions to obtain a reduced, regenerated and metal-contaminated catalyst and finally immediately contacting the reduced, regenerated and metal-contaminated cracking catalyst with a mixture of hydrogen and olefins to hydrogenate said olefins under hydrogenation conditions. U.S. Pat. No. 4,623,443 also discloses a process for converting hydrocarbons. The process comprises (1) contacting a hydrocarbon which contains metals with an active catalyst in a reaction zone under cracking conditions to obtain cracked products and a catalyst that has been partially deactivated and metal-contaminated; (2) separating the cracked products and the partially deactivated and metal-contaminated catalyst; (3) fractionating said cracked products into hydrogen, olefins and other hydrocarbons; (4) contacting said partially deactivated and metal-contaminated cracking catalyst with an oxygen-containing gas under regeneration conditions to obtain a regenerated and metal-contaminated catalyst; (5) circulating a part of said regenerated and metal-contaminated catalyst to said reaction zone (6) contacting the other part of the regenerated and metal-contaminated catalyst with a reducing gas under reduction conditions to obtain a reduced, regenerated and metal-contaminated catalyst; (7) contacting said reduced, regenerated and metal-contaminated catalyst with hydrogen and olefins under hydrogenation conditions to obtain hydrogenated olefins and a reduced, regenerated and metal-contaminated catalyst that is partially coked; (8) separating said hydrogenated olefins and said partially coked, reduced, regenerated and metal-contaminated catalyst; (9) circulating the hydrogenated olefins to the fraction system according to (3); (10) circulating the partially coked, reduced, regenerated and metal-contaminated catalyst to (4) to carry out regeneration. In recent years, requirements of fuel standards worldwide become more and more stringent for the sake of environmental protection. For instance, in China, “Criteria for Controlling Hazardous Materials in Automobile Gasoline” was regulated by the National Quality Monitoring Bureau in 1999. Sulfur content in gasoline should be less than 800 ppm according to the requirement of the Criteria. More stringent requirement of gasoline sulfur content i.e. less than 30 ppm, is regulated according to the Europe III Emission Standard of Fuel Oil. In fact, more than 90% of sulfur in gasoline is from FCC gasoline. In the other hand, more and more sour crude from the middle-east countries are processed in many Chinese refineries as FCC feedstock; meanwhile, crudes are getting more and more heavier in recent years. Therefore, there needs to develop a cracking catalyst with higher cracking activity and desulfurizing ability and a cracking process with higher ability for cracking and desulfurizing of heavy oil. U.S. Pat. No. 6,036,847 and its European counterpart patent EP 0,798,362A2 disclose a process for fluidized catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons, wherein said hydrocarbon feedstock is cracked in a cracking zone without adding hydrogen, and all particles, including catalyst particles, are circulated continuously between a cracking zone and a regeneration zone. In said process, besides said particles, there are additional particles which have a lower activity for cracking hydrocarbon oils than the catalyst particles, said activity being based on the fresh catalyst particles. The particles consist essentially of titanium oxide and an inorganic oxide other than non-titanium oxides. Said inorganic oxide other than non-titanium oxides contains a Lewis acid supported on alumina, and the Lewis acid is one selected from the group consisting of the following elements and their compounds: nickel, copper, zinc, silver, cadmium, indium, tin, mercury, thallium, led, bismuth, boron, aluminum (non alumina) and germanium. The sulfur content of FCC gasoline as the cracked product is decreased because of the use of a titanium oxide-containing additive. CN1078094C discloses a riser reactor for fluid catalytic cracking that comprises, vertically from bottom to top along said rector, a coaxial pre-lifting section, a first reaction zone, a second reaction zone with an expanded diameter and an outlet zone with a reduced diameter, and a horizontal pipe connected to the end of said outlet zone. The first reaction zone and the second reaction zone of the reactor can not only process under different conditions of, but also feedstock oils with different properties can be processed in separate stages. CN1076751C discloses a catalytic conversion process for preparing isobutane and isoalkane-rich gasoline, comprising feeding a preheated feedstock oil to a reactor having two reaction zones, contacting it with a hot cracking catalyst in the presence of a steam, carrying out primary and secondary reactions under cracking reaction conditions of a temperature of 530°-620° C. for 0.5-2 seconds in the first reaction zone and a temperature of 460-530° C. for 2-30 seconds in the second reaction zone, separating reaction products, feeding the spent catalyst that has been stripped to a regenerator, recycling the catalyst after coke thereon is burned. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a novel process for cracking hydrocarbon oils, having higher ability of cracking and desulfurizing heavy oils. The process of the present invention comprises contacting a hydrocarbon oil with a catalyst in a reactor having multiple reaction zones under cracking reaction conditions, separating reaction products and the catalyst to obtain a spent catalyst, regenerating at least a part of the spent catalyst, wherein said catalyst is a cracking catalyst containing metal component or a catalyst mixture of a cracking catalyst containing metal component and a cracking catalyst free of a metal component, wherein said metal component is present in maximum valence state or reduction valence state; based on said cracking catalyst containing metal component and calculated by oxide of the metal component in the maximum oxidation state, the content of metal component is 0.1-30 wt %; said metal component is one or more metals selected from the group consisting of non-aluminum metals of Group III A, metals of Group IVA, Group VA, Group IB, Group IIB, Group VB, Group VIB and Group VIIB, non-noble metals of Group VIII, and rare-earth metals in the Periodic Table of Elements; contacting a part of the spent catalyst and/or the regenerated catalyst with the hydrocarbon oil in the first reaction zone; contacting and reacting the other part of the spent catalyst and/or the regenerated catalyst in at least one of reaction zones after the first reaction zone with the products obtained in previous reaction zone; said process comprising further a step which comprises contacting the spent catalyst and/or the regenerated catalyst, or the mixture of the spent catalyst and/or the regenerated catalyst with a fresh catalyst with an atmosphere containing a reducing gas, prior to contacting and reacting with hydrocarbon oil or products obtained in previous reaction zones in at least a reaction zone; wherein the catalyst contacts with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas at a temperature of 100-900° C., at a pressure 0.1-0.5 MPa for at least 1 second and the amount of the atmosphere containing a reducing gas is no less than 0.03 cubic meters of the reducing gas per ton of the cracking catalyst containing metal component per minute. The process of present invention has a higher ability of heavy oil cracking and gasoline desulfurizing. In the process of the present invention, operational conditions for each reaction zone can be properly changed by increasing or reducing the number of the reaction zones according to market demand, such as, adjusting reaction temperature, catalyst/oil weight ratio (weight ratio of a catalyst to a hydrocarbon oil), reaction time and the like, to prepare different target products. For example, the yield of LPG and gasoline can be increased by increasing the temperature of each reaction zone and/or increasing the number of the reaction zones; and the temperature of the reaction zones after the first reaction zone may be lowered to reduce LPG output and produce maximally gasoline and/or diesel oil. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGS. 1-16 illustrate the schemes of the process according to the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 1. Reduction Process According to the process of the present invention, contacting said catalyst with an atmosphere containing a reducing gas may be carried out in situ or by circulating the catalyst to a reduction reactor, dependent upon the type of cracking reactor in which the reaction is conducted. When the cracking reactor is a fixed bed, a fluidized bed reactor or a moving-bed reactor, the catalyst is regenerated directly in situ without being circulated, and then an atmosphere containing a reducing gas is introduced to contact with the catalyst. The recycle of the catalyst can be realized by using cyclically a reactor filled with the catalyst that has contacted with an atmosphere containing a reducing gas. However, when a riser reactor is used as the cracking reactor, the catalyst is circulated into a regenerator, followed by circulating the regenerated catalyst into a reduction reactor where the catalyst contacts with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas. The regenerated catalyst includes completely regenerated catalyst, partially regenerated catalyst, or a mixture thereof. The catalyst entering the reduction reactor may be a regenerated catalyst directly from the regenerator or a regenerated catalyst from the regenerator that has been cooled or heated after being regenerated. The catalyst that has contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas may be introduced directly into a riser reactor or be introduced into a riser reactor after being cooled or heated. The regenerated catalyst and the catalyst that has contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas may be cooled or heated by any present heat-exchange apparatuses, such as shell-tube exchanger, plate heat exchanger, floating coil heat exchanger and/or hot air heater. These heat-exchange apparatuses are well known for one skilled in the art. In the reduction reactor, the catalyst may contact with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas at a temperature ranging from 100-900° C., preferably 400-700° C., at a pressure of 0.1-0.5 MPa, preferably 0.1-0.3 MPa, for at least 1 second, preferably from 10 seconds to 1 hr, more preferably from 1-40 minutes. The amount of the atmosphere containing a reducing gas is not less than 0.03 cubic meters of the reducing gas per ton of the cracking catalyst containing metal component per minute, preferably 0.05-15 cubic meters of the reducing gas per ton of the cracking catalyst containing metal component per minute, more preferably 1-8 cubic meters of the reducing gas per ton of the cracking catalyst containing metal component per minute. Said atmosphere containing a reducing gas refers to a pure reducing gas or an atmosphere containing a reducing gas and an inert gas. Examples of said pure reducing gas include one or more gases selected from hydrogen, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons containing 1-5 carbon atoms, preferably one or more gases selected from hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane and their isomers. Said inert gas refers to gas that does not react with a composition or metal compounds, such as one or more gases selected from the group consisting of Group zero gases in the Periodic Table of Elements, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. Examples of the atmosphere containing a reducing gas and inert gas include a mixture of one or more gases selected from hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons containing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms with one or more inert gases, or dry gas from refinery (e.g. catalytic cracking tail gas, catalytic reforming tail gas, hydrocracking tail gas and/or delayed coking tail gas and the like). In said atmosphere containing a reducing gas, the concentration of the reducing gas is not particularly limited. The content of reducing gas is preferably at least 10%, more preferably 50% by volume of said atmosphere containing a reducing gas. 2. Cracking Reaction—Regeneration Process According to the process of the present invention, a reactor comprises multiple reaction zones, i.e. are a first reaction zone, a second reaction zone, a third reaction zone . . . arranged along the direction in which hydrocarbon oils flow. The number of reaction zones can be increased or reduced according to different requirements, and the number of reaction zones is preferably 2 to 5, more preferably 2 to 3, wherein the first reaction zone is a first cracking reaction zone, the second reaction zone is a secondary reaction zone, and the following reaction zones are zones for multiple reactions. Said reactor may be a reactor of any form or combination of reactors. For example, the reactor may be one of reactors in any form and having multiple reaction zones, or a combination of reactors in any form and having multiple reaction zones, or a combination of reactors in any from and having multiple reaction zones with reactors having a single reaction zone, or a combination of reactors having a single reaction zone. More specifically, said reactor may be a riser reactor, a fixed-bed reactor, a fluidized bed reactor, a moving-bed reactor or combination thereof. More preferred reactor is a riser reactor or a combination of riser reactors, such as, an ordinary riser reactor, a riser reactor having multiple reaction zones (the riser reactor for fluid catalytic cracking disclosed in CN1078094C), or a combination of riser reactors mentioned above.

For example, when the reactor is a riser reactor having multiple reaction zones, cracking reaction conditions in each reaction zone may be adjusted by conventional measures, such as injecting a chilling agent into a region connecting two adjacent reaction zones and placing a heat exchanger in front of reaction zones requiring the same to adjust the temperature of a catalyst entering a corresponding reaction zone and/or the temperature for feeding hydrocarbon oils, so as to adjust the reaction temperature in each reaction zone, and adjusting the reaction time by adjusting the feeding rate of hydrocarbon oils. For example, adjusting the temperature of a catalyst entering a corresponding reaction zone could be realized by placing a heat exchanger in front of said reaction zone. Said heat exchanger may be a shell-tube exchanger, a plate heat exchanger, a floating coil heat exchanger and/or a hot air heater. Said heat exchanger and chilling agent are well known for one skilled in the art. In order to inhibit overcracking and thermal cracking reactions in a certain reaction zone and an outlet zone in the riser reactor, gas-solid rapid separation method may be used, or a chilling agent or a terminator may be injected into a region connecting said reaction zone with an adjacent previous reaction zone, or a region connecting the last reaction zone with an outlet zone, so as to reduce the temperature of the reaction zone and the outlet zone in the riser reactor. In this way, the product distribution can be improved, and the yield of gasoline and diesel oil can be increased. For gas-solid rapid separation methods, please see EP163978, EP139392, EP564678, U.S. Pat. No. 5,104,517 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,308,474. For methods of adding a chilling agent, please see U.S. Pat.

Cracking reaction conditions in each reactor (relative to each reaction zone) may be adjusted by conventional methods, such as adjustment of reaction temperature in each fixed-bed reactor (relative to each reaction zone) by heating or cooling. Generally, with regard to a fixed bed, fluidized bed and moving-bed reactor, the cracking conditions in each reaction zone are a reaction temperature of 350-700° C., preferably 400-650° C., a reaction pressure of 0.1-0.8 MPa, preferably 0.1-0.5 MPa, a WHSV of 1-40 hrs−1, preferably 2-30 hrs−1 and a catalyst/oil weight ratio of 1-30, preferably 2-15.

Some specific embodiments of the present invention are explained hereinafter in combination with the drawings. These embodiments are only some typical ones among the many embodiments of the present invention. The type, size, shape, parameters of reactor and other apparatus and number of reaction zones may be designed according to these embodiments based on practical situations. According to the first specific embodiment of the present invention, the process of the present invention can be carried out according to the scheme shown in FIG. 1. Reactor is a riser reactor for fluid catalytic cracking as disclosed in CN 1078094C. The reactor comprises vertically from bottom to top along said rector, a coaxial pre-lifting section, a first reaction zone, a second reaction zone with an expanded diameter and an outlet zone with a reduced diameter, and a horizontal pipe connected to the end of said outlet zone. Preferably, in said reactor, the diameter ratio of the first reaction zone to the pre-lifting section is 1-1.2, the diameter ratio of the second reaction zone to the first reaction zone is 1.5-5.0, the diameter ratio of the outlet zone to the first reaction zone is 0.8-1.5. The pre-lifting section has a height 5-20% of total height of the reactor. The first reaction zone has a height 10-30% of total height of the reactor. The second reaction zone has a height 30-60% of total height of the reactor. The outlet zone has a height of 0-20% of total height of the reactor. The region connecting the first reaction zone and the second reaction zone is in truncated cone having a longitudinal section as an isosceles trapezoid with a top angle α of 30°-80°, the region connecting the second reaction zone and the outlet zone is also in truncated cone having a longitudinal section as an isosceles trapezoid with a base angle β of 45-85°. According to the first specific embodiment of the present invention, the process of the present invention can be carried out according to the scheme shown in FIG. 1. A part of a catalyst that has contacted with an atmosphere containing a reducing gas from reduction reactor 3 is optionally introduced into heat exchanger 7 via line 6 to carry out heat-exchange. The optionally heat-exchanged catalyst is introduced into the pre-lifting section of reactor via line 8, then driven by pre-lifting steam from line 10 to move upward into the first reaction zone 9. Meanwhile, the preheated hydrocarbon oil from line 11 is mixed with the atomizing steam from 12 and introduced into the first reaction zone 9, where said hydrocarbon oil contacts with the catalyst to carry out a cracking reaction. The reaction stream continues to move upward into the second reaction zone 14, meanwhile, the other part of the catalyst that has contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from reduction reactor 3 is optionally introduced into heat exchanger 27 via line 26 to carry out heat-exchange. The optionally heat-exchanged catalyst is introduced into the second reaction zone 14 via line 28. In the second reaction zone 14, the reaction stream from the first reaction zone 9 contacts with the catalyst from line 28 to carry out a second reaction. If cooling is required, a chilling agent from line 13 may be injected into the region connecting the reaction zone 9 with the second reaction zone 14 to mix with the reaction stream. After the second reaction, the stream continues to move upward through outlet zone 15 into settler 17 of the separation system via a horizontal pipe 16. The catalyst and cracked products are separated in settler 17 by the cyclone separator. In order to inhibit overcracking and thermal cracking in the outlet zone of the riser, the temperature of reaction stream can be decreased by using gas-solid rapid separation or adding a terminator via line 29 to the region connecting the outlet zone 15 and the second reaction zone 14. The separated catalyst is introduced into stripper 18 of the separation system to contact in counter flow with steam from line 19, and cracked products remained on the catalyst are stripped out to obtain a spent catalyst. The cracked products obtained by separation and stripped products are mixed and discharged via line 20, then continue to be separated into various distillates in the separation system.

The waste gas formed is vented out via line 5. In this case, when the temperature of the reduction reactor 3 is at a reaction temperature required for the first or second reaction zone, the catalyst that has contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas can be introduced directly into the pre-lifting section of the reactor or the second reaction zone without passing through the heat exchanger 7 or heat exchanger 27. According to the second specific embodiment of the present invention, the process of the present invention can be carried out according to the scheme shown in FIG. 2.

The common riser reactor may be any conventional common riser reactor, such as a conventional equal diameter riser reactor or an equal-linear speed riser reactor. The first reaction zone is the lower part of the riser reaction zone. The second reaction zone is the upper part of the riser reaction zone. The pre-lifting section has a length 5-20% of the total length of the riser reaction zone, and the first reaction zone has a length 10-30% of the total length of the riser reaction zone.

The function of atomizing steam is to obtain a better effect of atomizing hydrocarbon oil, so that to the hydrocarbon oil and catalyst will be mixed more homogeneously. The function of steam used as a pre-lifting media is to make the catalyst take effect more quickly so as to form a catalyst piston flow with a uniform density in the pre-lifting section. The amount of said atomizing steam and pre-lifting steam is well known for one skilled in the art. Generally, the total amount of atomizing steam and pre-lifting steam is about 1-30%, preferably 2-15% by weight of hydrocarbon oil. The function of stripping steam is to displace oil gas filled between granules of catalyst and in granular pores so as to increase the yield of oil products. The amount of stripping steam is well known for one skilled in the art. Generally, the amount of stripping steam is 0.1-0.8%, preferably 0.2-0.4% by weight of the circulation rate of the catalyst. The pre-lifting steam may be replaced with other pre-lifting media, such as dry gases from refining factories, light paraffin, light olefins, or mixed gases of dry gas from refining, factories and steam. Said oxygen-containing atmosphere may be oxygen or any mixed oxygen-containing gas, and a common oxygen-containing atmosphere is air. Said regeneration temperature is well known for one skilled in the art, which is, generally, 600-770° C., preferably 650-730° C. Said inert gas comprises any gas or gaseous mixture that does not react with the catalyst such as one or more gas selected from group consisting of nitrogen, Group 0 gas in the Periodic Table of Elements/carbon dioxide. The amount of said inert gas is sufficient enough to displace the oxygen-containing gas entrained in the catalyst. Generally, the amount of the inert gas is 0.01-30 cubic meters, preferably 1-15 cubic meters, per ton catalyst per minute. Since a small amount of catalyst will be lost after the catalyst is circulated for a given period of time, storage tank 1 plays a role of supplementing regularly or irregularly the consumed catalyst in the reaction. The metal component comprised in the catalyst in storage tank 1 may be in a reduced state or in an oxidation state. 3. Catalyst (1).

The contents of the other components in said cracking catalyst containing metal component are within the range of conventional contents of this type of catalyst, and are well known for one skilled in the art. For example, on the basis of said cracking catalyst containing metal component the content of said molecular sieve is 1-90 wt/%, the content of the refractory inorganic oxide is 2-80 wt %, the content of the clay is 0-80 wt % and the content of phosphor is 0-15 wt % calculated by phosphorus pentoxide. Preferably, the content of said molecular sieve is 10-60 wt %, the content of the refractory inorganic oxide is 10-50 wt %, the content of the clay is 20-70 wt %, and the content of phosphor is 0-8 wt %.

Said maximum oxidative valence state of the metal described here refers to the highest oxidation state of said metal that can be present stably in metal oxide after being adequately oxidized. For example, the maximum oxidative valence state of non-aluminum metals of Group IIIA in the Periodic Table of Elements is generally +3 valence (e.g. gallium); the maximum oxidative valence state of Group IVA metals is generally +4 valence; the maximum oxidative valence state of Group VA metals is generally +5 valence; the maximum oxidative valence state of Group IB metals is generally +2 valence (e.g. copper) or +1 valence (e.g. silver); the maximum oxidative valence state of Group IIB metals is generally +2 valence; the maximum oxidative valence state of Group IIB metals is generally +5 valence; the maximum oxidative valence state of Group VIB metals is generally +6 valence; the maximum oxidative valence state of Group VIIB metals is generally +4 valence (e.g. manganese) or +7 valence (e.g. rhenium); the oxidation state of Group VIII non-noble metals is generally +3 valence (e.g. iron or cobalt) or +2 valence (e.g. nickel).

This shows that the process of the present invention is also suitable for catalytically cracking sulfur-free hydrocarbon oils, and the process of the present invention has much higher ability of cracking heavy oils and is suitable for high production of LPG and gasoline. Examples 24 to 27 The following examples describe the process of the present invention. This group of examples aims mainly at high production of diesel oil. The catalytically cracking of a mixed oil of 50 wt % of feedstock oil 2# and 50 wt % of feedstock oil 1# as shown in Table 4 was carried out according to the scheme shown in FIG. 3. The catalyst used was catalyst C6-C9 prepared in examples 6-9 respectively. The heat exchanger 7 was a hot air heater. Said reactor was a conventional equal-diameter riser reactor. The reactor was 4000 mm high and had a pre-lifting section with a height of 500 mm and an inner diameter of 14 mm. The first reaction zone 11 was 1200 mm high and had a second reaction zone 12 with a height of 1550 mm. The inner diameters of the first reaction zone and the second reaction zone were all 20 mm respectively. The outlet zone had an inner diameter of 14 mm and a height of 750 mm. The first reaction zone 9 was below the region connecting line 28 with the reactor, the second reaction zone 14 was above the region connecting line 28 with the reactor, and the outlet zone 15 was above the region connecting line 29 with the reactor. A part of catalyst that had contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from reduction reactor 3 was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 7 via line 6 to carry out heat-exchange. The optionally heat-exchanged catalyst was introduced into the pre-lifting section of the reactor via line 8, and then driven by pre-lifting steam from line 10 to move upward into the first reaction zone 9. Meanwhile, the preheated hydrocarbon oil from line 11 and the atomizing steam from line 12 were mixed and introduced into the first reaction zone 9, where said hydrocarbon oil contacted with the catalyst to carry out a first cracking reaction. A chilling agent was injected into the region connecting the first reaction zone 9 with the second reaction zone 14 from line 13 (at a place having a height of 1800 mm from the bottom of the riser reactor). The chilling agent was a crude gasoline at room temperature with a distillation range of 121-250° C. and was used in such an amount that the reaction temperature of reaction stream at the second reaction zone 14 was decreased to that shown in Table 9. The reaction stream continued to move upward to mix with the chilling agent and enter the second reaction zone 14, meanwhile, the other part of the catalyst that had contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from reduction reactor 3 was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 27 via line 26 to carry out heat-exchange. The optionally heat-exchanged catalyst was introduced into the second reaction zone 14 via line 28. In the second reaction zone 14, the reaction stream from the first reaction zone 9 contacted with the catalyst from line 28 to carry out a second reaction. After the second reaction, the stream continued to move upward through outlet zone 15 into settler 17 of the separation system via horizontal pipe 16, and in settler 17 the catalyst and cracked products were separated by the cyclone separator. The separated catalyst was introduced into stripper 18 of the separation system to contact in counter flow with steam from line 19, and cracked products remained on the catalyst were stripped out to obtain a spent catalyst. The cracked products obtained by separation and stripped products were mixed, and then discharged from line 20, and continued to be separated into various distillates in the separation system. The spent catalyst was introduced into regenerator 22 via sloped tube 21. In regenerator 22, the spent catalyst contacted with excess air from line 23 to remove coke thereon, and the flue gas formed was vented out from line 24. The regenerated catalyst was introduced into reduction reactor 3 via line 25, in reduction reactor 3 the regenerated catalyst contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from line 4 under reduction conditions. After reaction, the waste gas was vented out via line 5. Operation conditions are shown in Table 9 and the compositions of products are shown in Table 10.

The catalytic cracking of feedstock oil 2# shown in Table 4 was carried out according to the scheme shown in FIG. 4. The catalysts used were catalysts C10-C13 prepared in examples 10-13. Said reactor was the same reactor as described in examples 24-27. A part of catalyst that had contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from reduction reactor 3 was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 7 via line 6 to carry out heat-exchange. The optionally heat-exchanged catalyst was introduced into the pre-lifting section of the reactor via line 8, and then driven by pre-lifting steam from line 10 to move upward into the first reaction zone 9. Meanwhile, the preheated hydrocarbon oil from line 11 and the atomizing steam from line 12 were mixed and introduced into the first reaction zone 9, where said hydrocarbon oil contacted with the catalyst to carry out a first cracking reaction. A chilling agent was injected into the region connecting the first reaction zone 11 with the second reaction zone 14 from line 13 (at a place having a height of 1800 mm from the bottom of the riser reactor), the chilling agent was a crude gasoline at room temperature with a distillation range of 121-250° C. and was used in such an amount that the reaction temperature of reaction stream at the second reaction zone 14 was decreased to that shown in Table 11. The reaction stream continued to move upward to mix with the chilling agent and enter the second reaction zone 14, meanwhile, the other part of the catalyst that had contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from reduction reactor 3 was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 27 via line 26 to carry out heat-exchange. The optionally heat-exchanged catalyst was introduced into the second reaction zone 14 via line 28. In the second reaction zone 14, the reaction stream from the first reaction zone 9 contacted with the catalyst from line 28 to carry out a second reaction. A terminator was added via line 29 into the region connecting the second reaction zone with the outlet zone (at the place having a height of 3400 mm from the bottom of the riser reactor). The terminator was a crude gasoline at room temperature with a distillation range of 121 to 250° C. and was used in such an amount that the temperature of the outlet zone was decreased to that shown in Table 11. After the second reaction, the stream continued to move upward to mix with the terminator and pass through outlet zone 15 via line 16 into settler 17 of the separation system, in settler 17 the catalyst and cracked products were separated by the cyclone separator. The separated catalyst was introduced into stripper 18 of the separation system to contact in counter flow with steam from line 19, and cracked products remained on the catalyst were stripped out to obtain a spent catalyst. The cracked products obtained by separation and stripped products were mixed, and then discharged from line 20, and continued to be separated into various distillates in the separation system. The spent catalyst was introduced into regenerator 22 via sloped tube 21. In regenerator 22, the spent catalyst contacted with excess air from line 23 to remove coke thereon, and the flue gas formed was vented out from line 24. The regenerated catalyst was introduced via line 25 into gas displacement tank 30, where the air entrained by a mixture of the regenerated catalyst and a fresh catalyst in a weight relative to 5 wt % of the regenerated catalyst from storage tank 1 via line 2 was displaced with helium from line 31. The displacing gas used was vented out via line 32. The gas-displaced catalyst was introduced into reduction reactor 3 via line 33 to contact with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from line 4 under reduction conditions.

This group of examples aims mainly at high production of diesel oil. The catalytic cracking of a mixed oil of 20 wt % of feedstock oil 1# and 80 wt % of feedstock oil 2# shown in Table 4 was carried out according to the scheme shown in FIG. 2. Said reactor was a diameter-changing riser reactor as disclosed in CN1078094. The reactor had a total height of 15 m and the pre-lifting section has a height of 1.5 m with a diameter of 0.25 m. The first reaction zone 9 had a height of 4 m with a diameter of 0.25 m. The second reaction zone 14 had a height of 6.5 m with a diameter of 0.5 m.

A part of catalyst that had contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from reduction reactor 3 was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 7 via line 6 to carry out heat-exchange. The optionally heat-exchanged catalyst was introduced into the pre-lifting section of the reactor via line 8, and then driven by pre-lifting steam from line 10 to move upward into the first reaction zone 9. Meanwhile, the preheated hydrocarbon oil from line 11 and the atomizing steam from line 12 were mixed and introduced into the first reaction zone 9, where said hydrocarbon oil contacted with the catalyst to carry out a first cracking reaction. A chilling agent was injected into the region connecting the first reaction zone 9 with the second reaction zone 14 from line 13 (at a place having a height of 6.2 mm from the bottom of the riser reactor). The chilling agent was a crude gasoline at room temperature with a to distillation range of 121-250° C. and was used in such an amount that the reaction temperature of reaction stream at the second reaction zone 14 was decreased to that shown in Table 13. The reaction stream continued to move upward to mix with the chilling agent and enter the second reaction zone 14, meanwhile, the other part of the catalyst that had contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from reduction reactor 3 was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 27 via line 26 to carry out heat-exchange. The optionally heat-exchanged catalyst was introduced into the second reaction zone 14 via line 28. In the second reaction zone 14, the reaction stream from the first reaction zone 9 contacted with the catalyst from line 28 to carry out a second reaction. A terminator was added via line 29 into the region connecting the second reaction zone with outlet zone (at the place having a height of 12.3 mm from the bottom of the riser reactor). The terminator was a crude gasoline at room temperature with a distillation range of 121 to 250° C. and was used in such an amount that the temperature of the outlet zone was decreased to that shown in Table 13. After the second reaction, the stream continued to move upward to mix with the terminator and pass through outlet zone 15 via line 16 into settler 17 of the separation system. The catalyst and cracked products were separated in settler 17 by the cyclone separator. The separated catalyst was introduced into stripper 18 of the separation system to contact in counter flow with steam from line 19, and cracked products remained on the catalyst were stripped out to obtain a spent catalyst. The cracked products obtained by separation and stripped products were mixed, and then discharged via line 20, and continued to be separated into various distillates in the separation system. The spent catalyst was introduced into regenerator 22 via sloped tube 21. In regenerator 22, the spent catalyst contacted with excess air from line 23 to remove coke thereon, and the flue gas formed was vented out from line 24. The regenerated catalyst was introduced via line 25 into gas displacement tank 30, where the air entrained by the regenerated catalyst was displaced with nitrogen from line 31.

This shows that the process of the present invention has much higher ability of cracking and desulfurizing heavy oil, so it is suitable for high production of gasoline. Examples 41 to 45 The following examples describe the process of the present invention. This group of examples aims mainly at high production of LPG and gasoline. The catalytic cracking of feedstock oil 3# shown in Table 4 was carried out according to FIG. 6. The catalysts used were catalysts C1-C5 prepared in examples 1-5 respectively. Said reactor was that described in examples 14-18. The catalyst that had contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas was introduced into the pre-lifting section of the reactor from line 8, and then driven by pre-lifting steam from line 10 to move upward into the first reaction zone 9. Meanwhile, the preheated hydrocarbon oil from line 11 and the atomizing steam from line 12 were mixed and introduced into the first reaction zone 9, where said hydrocarbon oil contacted with the catalyst to carry out a first cracking reaction. The reaction stream continued to move upward to the second reaction zone 14, where it contacted with the spent catalyst from line 28 to carry out a second reaction. After the second reaction, the stream continued to move upward through outlet zone 15 into settler 17 of the separation system via horizontal pipe 16, in settler 17 the catalyst and cracked products were separated by the cyclone separator. The separated catalyst was introduced into stripper 18 of the separation system to contact in counter flow with steam from line 19, and cracked products remained on the catalyst were stripped out to obtain the spent catalyst. The cracked products obtained by separation and stripped products were mixed, and then discharged from line 20, and continued to be separated into various distillates in the separation system. The spent catalyst was introduced into regenerator 22 via sloped tube 21. In regenerator 22, a part of the spent catalyst contacted with excess air from line 23 to remove coke thereon, and the flue gas formed was vented out from line 24. The regenerated catalyst was introduced via line 25 into gas displacement tank 30, where the oxygen-containing gas entrained by the regenerated catalyst was displaced with nitrogen from line 31. The displacing gas used was vented out via line 32 and the gas-displaced catalyst was introduced into reduction reactor 3 via line 33. In reduction reactor 3, the regenerated catalyst contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from line 4 under reduction conditions. After reaction, the waste gas was vented out via line 5. The catalyst that had contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 7 via line 6 to carry out heat-exchange, the optionally heat-exchanged catalyst was introduced into the pre-lifting section of the reactor via line 8. The other part of the spent catalyst was introduced into regenerator 22, and then rapidly optionally introduced into heat exchanger 27 via line 26. The optionally heat-exchanged spent catalyst was introduced into the second reaction zone via line 28 to contact and react with the reaction product from the first reaction zone 9. Operation conditions are shown in Table 17 and the compositions of products are shown in Table 18. Comparative Example 6 DB6 This comparative example describes a reference process for cracking olefin oils. The same feedstock oil was catalytically cracked by the same catalyst according to the process in example 43, except that the catalyst entering reduction reactor 3 did not contact with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas, namely that no atmosphere containing a reducing gas was introduced from line 4 into the reactor.

Examples 58-62 The following examples describe the process of the present invention. This group of examples aims mainly at high production of gasoline. The catalytic cracking of feedstock oil 1# shown in Table 4 was carried out in accordance with the scheme shown in FIG. 9. The catalysts used were catalysts C1-C5 prepared in examples 1-5 respectively. Said reactor was that described in examples 14-18. The catalyst that had contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas was introduced into the pre-lifting section of the reactor from line 8, and driven by pre-lifting steam from line 10 to move upward into the first reaction zone 9. Meanwhile, the preheated hydrocarbon oil from line 11 was mixed with the atomizing steam from line 12 and introduced into the first reaction zone 9, where said hydrocarbon oil contacted with the catalyst to carry out a first cracking reaction. The reaction stream continued to move upward to the second reaction zone 14, where it contacted with the regenerated catalyst from line 28 to carry out a second reaction. After the second reaction, the stream continued to move upward through outlet zone 15 into settler 17 of separation system via a horizontal pipe 16, in settler 17 the catalyst and cracked products were separated by the cyclone separator. The separated catalyst was introduced into stripper 18 to contact in counter flow with steam from line 19, and cracked products remained on the catalyst were stripped out to obtain a spent catalyst. The cracked products obtained by separation and stripped products were mixed, and then discharged from line 20, and continued to be separated into various distillates in the separation system. The spent catalyst was introduced into regenerator 22 via sloped tube 21. In regenerator 22, the spent catalyst contacted with excess air atmosphere from line 23 at a regeneration temperature to remove coke thereon, and the flue gas formed was vented out from line 24. A part of the regenerated catalyst was introduced into reduction reactor 3 via line 25, in reduction reactor 3 the regenerated catalyst contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from line 4 under reduction conditions. After reaction, the waste gas was vented out via line 5. The catalyst that had contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 7 via line 6 to carry out heat-exchange, the optionally heat-exchanged catalyst was introduced into the pre-lifting section of the reactor. The other part of the regenerated catalyst was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 27 via line 26 to carry out heat-exchange. After optionally heat-exchanged, the regenerated catalyst was introduced into the second reaction zone via line 28. Operation conditions are shown in Table 25 and the compositions of products are shown in Table 26. Comparative Example 9 DB9 This comparative example describes a reference process for cracking olefin oils. The same feedstock oil was catalytically cracked by the same catalyst according to the process used in example 58, except that the catalyst entering reduction reactor 3 did not contact with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas, namely that no atmosphere containing a reducing gas was introduced from line 4 into the reactor.

A chilling agent was injected into the region connecting the first reaction zone 9 with the second reaction zone 14 from line 13 (at a place having a height of 1800 mm from the bottom of the riser reactor). The chilling agent was a crude gasoline at room temperature with a distillation range of 121-250° C. and was used in such an amount that the reaction temperature of reaction stream at the second reaction zone 14 was decreased to that shown in Table 11. The reaction stream continued to move upward to mix with chilling agent and enter the second reaction zone 14, where it contacted with the regenerated catalyst from line 28 to carry out a second reaction. A terminator was added via line 29 into the region connecting the second reaction zone with outlet zone (at a place having a height of 3400 mm from the bottom of the riser reactor). The terminator was a crude gasoline at room temperature with a distillation range of 121 to 250° C. and was used in such an amount that the temperature of the outlet zone was decreased to that shown in Table 11.

In regenerator 22, the spent catalyst contacted with excess air from line 23 at a regeneration temperature to remove coke thereon, and the flue gas formed was vented out from line 24. A part of the regenerated catalyst was introduced via line 25 into gas displacement tank 30, where the oxygen-containing gas entrained by a mixture of the regenerated catalyst and a fresh catalyst (which was in a weight corresponding to 5 wt % of the regenerated catalyst) from tank 1 via line 2 was displaced with helium from line 31. The displacing gas used was vented out via line 32 and the gas-displaced catalyst was introduced into reduction reactor 3 via line 33. In reduction reactor 3, said catalyst contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from line 4 under reduction conditions. After reaction, the waste gas was vented out via line 5. The catalyst that had contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 7 via line 6 to carry out heat-exchange, the optionally heat-exchanged catalyst was introduced into the pre-lifting section of the reactor.

The catalyst that had contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas was introduced into the pre-lifting section of the reactor from line 8, and driven by pre-lifting steam from line 10 to move upward into the first reaction zone 9. Meanwhile, the preheated hydrocarbon oil from line 11 was mixed with the atomizing steam from line 12 and introduced into the first reaction zone 9, where said hydrocarbon oil contacted with the catalyst to carry out a first cracking reaction. A chilling agent was injected into the region connecting the first reaction zone 9 with the second reaction zone 14 from line 13 (at a place having a height of 6.2 m from the bottom of the riser reactor). The chilling agent was a crude gasoline at room temperature with a distillation range of 121-250° C. and was used in such an amount that the reaction temperature of reaction stream at the second reaction zone 14 was decreased to that shown in Table 13. The reaction stream continued to move upward to the second reaction zone 14, where it contacted with the regenerated catalyst from line 28 to carry out a second reaction. A terminator was injected into the region connecting the second reaction zone 14 and outlet zone 15 (at a place having a height of 12.3 m from the bottom of the riser reactor) from line 29. The terminator was a crude gasoline at room temperature with a distillation range of 121-250° C. and was used in such an amount that the reaction temperature of the reaction stream at outlet zone 15 was decreased to that shown in Table 13. After the second reaction, the stream continued to move upward to mix with the terminator and pass through outlet zone 15 into settler 17 of separation system via a horizontal pipe 16, in settler 17 the catalyst and cracked products were separated by the cyclone separator. The separated catalyst was introduced into stripper 18 to contact in counter flow with the steam from line 19, and cracked products remained on the catalyst were stripped out to obtain a spent catalyst. The cracked products obtained by separation and stripped products were mixed, and then discharged via line 20, and continued to be separated into various distillates in the separation system. The spent catalyst was introduced into regenerator 22 via sloped tube 21. In regenerator 22, the spent catalyst contacted with excess air from line 23 at a regeneration temperature to remove coke thereon, and the flue gas formed was vented out from line 24. A part of the regenerated catalyst was introduced via line 25 into gas displacement tank 30, where the oxygen-containing gas entrained by the part of the regenerated catalyst was displaced with nitrogen from line 31. The displacing gas used was vented out via line 32; the gas-displaced catalyst was introduced into reduction reactor 3 via line 33. In reduction reactor 3, said catalyst contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from line 4 under reduction conditions. After reaction, the waste gas was vented out via line 5. The catalyst that had contacted with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 7 via line 6 to carry out heat-exchange, the optionally heat-exchanged catalyst was introduced into the pre-lifting section of the reactor. The other part of the regenerated catalyst was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 27 to carry out heat-exchange via line 26, the optionally heat-exchanged regenerated catalyst was introduced into the second reaction zone via line 28. Operation conditions are shown in Table 33 and the compositions of products are shown in Table 34. Comparative Example 11 DB11 This comparative example describes a reference process for cracking olefin oils. The same feedstock oil was catalytically cracked by the same catalyst according to the process used in example 76, except that the catalyst entering reduction reactor 3 did not contact with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas, namely that no atmosphere containing a reducing gas was introduced from line 4 into the reactor. Operation conditions are shown in Table 33 and the compositions of products are shown in Table 34.

Said reactor was that described in examples 24-27. A part of the regenerated catalyst from regenerator 22 was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 7 via line 6. The optionally heat-exchanged catalyst was introduced into the pre-lifting section of the reactor via line 8, and driven by pre-lifting steam from line 10 to move upward into the first reaction zone 9. Meanwhile, the preheated hydrocarbon oil from line 11 and the atomizing steam from line 12 were mixed and introduced into the first reaction zone 9, where said hydrocarbon oil contacted with the catalyst to carry out a first cracking reaction. A chilling agent was injected into the region connecting the first reaction zone 9 with the second reaction zone 14 from line 13 (at a place having a height of 1800 mm from the bottom of the riser reactor). The chilling agent was a crude gasoline at room temperature with a distillation range of 121-250° C. and was used in such an amount that the reaction temperature of reaction stream at the second reaction zone 14 was decreased to that shown in Table 11. The reaction stream continued to move upward to mix with the chilling agent and enter the second reaction zone.

The displacing gas used was vented out via line 32. The gas-displaced catalyst was introduced into reduction reactor 3 via line 33 to contact with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from line 4 under reduction conditions. After reaction, the waste gas was vented out via line 5. The catalyst that had contacted with atmosphere containing a reducing gas was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 27 via line 26. The optionally heat-exchanged catalyst was introduced into the second reaction zone 14 via line 28, in the second reaction zone 14 the reaction stream from the first reaction zone 9 contacted with the catalyst from line 28 to carry out a second reaction. A terminator was added via line 29 into the region connecting the second reaction zone with outlet zone (at a place having a height of 3400 mm from the bottom of the riser reactor). The terminator was a crude gasoline at room temperature with a distillation range of 121 to 250° C. and was used in such an amount that the temperature of the outlet zone was decreased to that shown in Table 11. After the second reaction, the stream continued to move upward to mix with the terminator and pass through outlet zone 15 into settler 17 of the separation system via horizontal pipe 16, in settler 17 the catalyst and cracked products were separated by the cyclone separator. The separated catalyst was introduced into stripper 18 of the separation system to contact in counter flow with steam from line 19, and cracked products remained on the catalyst were stripped out to obtain a spent catalyst. The cracked products obtained by separation and stripped products were mixed, and then discharged from line 20, and continued to be separated into various distillates in the separation system. The spent catalyst was introduced into regenerator 22 via sloped tube 21. In regenerator 22, the spent catalyst contacted with excess air from line 23 at a regeneration temperature to remove coke thereon. The flue gas formed was vented out from line 24.

This group of examples aims mainly at high production of diesel oil. The catalytic cracking of a mixed oil of 20 wt % of feedstock oil 1# and 80 wt % of feedstock oil 2# as shown in Table 4 was carried out according to FIG. 14. Said reactor was that described in examples 32-35. The catalysts used were C14, C15, C16 and C17 respectively. A part of the regenerated catalyst from regenerator 22 was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 7 via line 6. The optionally heat-exchanged catalyst was introduced into the pre-lifting section of the reactor via line 8, and driven by pre-lifting dry gas from line 10 to move upward into the first reaction zone 9. Meanwhile, the preheated hydrocarbon oil from line 11 and the atomizing steam from line 12 were mixed and introduced into the first reaction zone 9, where said hydrocarbon oil contacted with the catalyst to carry out a first cracking reaction. A chilling agent was injected into the region connecting the first reaction zone 9 with the second reaction zone 14 from line 13 (at a place having a height of 6.2 m from the bottom of the riser reactor). The chilling agent was a crude gasoline at room temperature with a distillation range of 121-250° C. and was used in such an amount that the reaction temperature of reaction stream at the second reaction zone 14 was decreased to that shown in Table 13. The reaction stream continued to move upward to mix with the chilling agent and enter the second reaction zone 14. Meanwhile, the other part of the regenerated catalyst from regenerator 22 was introduced via line 25 into gas displacement tank 30, where the oxygen-containing gas entrained by the regenerated catalyst was displaced with nitrogen from line 31. The displacing gas used was vented out via line 32; the gas-displaced catalyst was introduced into reduction reactor 3 via line 33. The gas-displaced catalyst was introduced into reduction reactor 3 via line 33 to contact with the atmosphere containing a reducing gas from line 4 under reduction conditions. After reaction, the waste gas was vented out via line 5. The catalyst that had contacted with atmosphere containing a reducing gas was optionally introduced into heat exchanger 27 via line 26. The optionally heat-exchanged catalyst was introduced into the second reaction zone 14 via line 28, in the second reaction zone 14 the reaction stream from the first reaction zone 9 contacted with the catalyst from line 28 to carry out a second reaction. A terminator was added via line 29 into the region connecting the second reaction zone with outlet zone (at a place having a height of 12.3 m from the bottom of the riser reactor). The terminator was a crude gasoline at room temperature with a distillation range of 121 to 250° C. and was used in such an amount that the temperature of the outlet zone was decreased to that shown in Table 13. After the second reaction, the stream continued to move upward and mix with the terminator and pass through outlet zone 15 into settler 17 of separation system via a horizontal pipe 16, in settler 17 the catalyst and cracked products were separated by the cyclone separator. The separated catalyst was introduced into stripper 18 of the separation system to contact in counter flow with the steam from line 19, and cracked products remained on the catalyst were stripped out to obtain a spent catalyst. The cracked products obtained by separation and stripped products were mixed, and then discharged via line 20, and continued to be separated into various distillates in the separation system. After stripped, the spent catalyst was introduced into regenerator 20 via sloped tube 19, where the spent catalyst contacted with excess air from line 23 to remove coke thereon, and the flue gas formed was vented off via line 22. Operation conditions are shown in Table 43 and the compositions of products are shown in Table 44.
