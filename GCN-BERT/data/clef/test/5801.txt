LOW ASH LUBRICANT AND FUEL ADDITIVE COMPRISING PQLYAIVIiNE This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/980,787, filed April 17, 2014, US Provisional Application No. 61/980,811 , filed April 17, 2014, and US Patent Application No. 14/686,221 , filed March 23, 2015. Disclosed is a class of reduced ash detergent/anti-oxidant additives that are products of the reaction of one or more carboxlyic acid, one or more boron compound, one or more po!yamine, and optionally one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of alkoxylated amines and alkoxylated amides. Also disclosed are lubricating oil compositions and fuel compositions containing the reaction products. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Metal detergents represent a major source of ash in formulated engine oils. Alkaline earth sulfonates, phenafes and salicylates are typically used in modern engine oils to provide detergency and alkaline reserve. Detergents are necessary components of engine oils for both gasoline and diesei engines, incomplete combustion of the fuel produces soot that can lead to sludge deposits, as well as carbon and varnish deposits. In the case of diesei fuel, residual sulfur in the fuel burns in the combustion chamber to produce sulfur derived acids. These acids produce corrosion and wear in the engine, and accelerate degradation of the oil. Neutral and overbased detergents are added to engine oils to neutralize these acidic compounds, thereby preventing the formation of harmful engine deposits and dramatically increasing engine life. U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,668 discloses a lubricant oil composition useful for reducing friction in an internal combustion engine which comprises a lubricating oil basestock and an alkoxylated amine salt of a hydrocarbylsaiicylic acid of a defined formula. U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,751 discloses that two-stroke cycle engines can be effectively lubricated by supplying to the engine a mixture of an oil of lubricating viscosity and a hydrocarbyl-substituted hydroxyaromatic carboxylic acid or an ester, unsubstituted amide, hydrocarbyl-substituted amide, ammonium salt, hydrocarbylamine salt, or monovalent metal salt thereof in an amount suitable to reduce piston deposits in said engine. The mixture supplied to the engine contains less than 0.06 percent by weight of divalent metals. U.S. Pat. Mo. 5,854,182 discloses the preparation of magnesium borate overbased metallic detergent having magnesium borate uniformly dispersed in an extremely fine particle size by using magnesium alkoxide and boric acid. The preparation involves reacting a neutral su!phonate of an alkaline earth metal with magnesium alkoxide and boric acid under anhydrous conditions in the presence of a dilution solvent followed by distillation to remove alcohol and part of dilution solvent therefrom. The borated mixture is then cooled, filtered to recover magnesium borated metal detergent, which is said to exhibit excellent cleaning and dispersing performance, very good hydrolytsc and oxidation stability, and good extreme pressure and antswear properties. U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,842 discloses a lubricating oil composition that contains from 50 to 1000 parts per million of molybdenum from a molybdenum compound that is oil-soluble and substantially free of reactive sulfur, 1 ,000 to 20,000 parts per million of a diarylamine, and 2,000 to 40,000 parts per million of a phenate. This combination of ingredients is said to provide improved oxidation control and improved deposit control to the lubricating oil. U.S. Pat. No. 8,339,052 discloses a lubricating oil composition for gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines includes a major portion of an oil of lubricating viscosity; from 0.1 to 20.0% w/w of a component A, which is a sulfurized, overbased calcium phenate detergent derived from distilled, hydrogenated cashew nut shell liquid; and from 0.1 to 10.0% w/w of a component B, which is an amine salt of phosphorodithloic acid of a specified formula derived from cashew nut shell liquid.

These oils are exemplified by the oils prepared through polymerization of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, the alky! and phenyl ethers of these polyoxyalkylene polymers (e.g., methyl poly propylene glycol ether having an average molecular weight of 1 ,000, diphenyl ether of polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of 500 to 1000, diethyl ether of polypropylene glycol having a molecular weight of 1 ,000 to 1 ,500, etc.) or mono- and polycarboxylic esters thereof such as, for example, the acetic esters, mixed Ca-Ca fatty acid esters, or the Ci3oxo acid diester of tetraethy!ene glycol. Yet another class of useful synthetic lubricating oils include, but are not limited to, the esters of dicarboxylic acids e.g., phthalic acid, succinic acid, a!kyl succinic acids, a!kenyl succinic acids, maleic acid, azelaic acid, suberic acid, sebacic acid, fumaric acid, adipic acid, linoleic acid dimer, malonic acids, alkyl malonic acids, alkenyl malonic acids, etc., with a variety of alcohols, e.g., butyl alcohol, hexyl alcohol, dodecyl alcohol, 2~e†hy!hexyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoether, propylene glycol, etc. Specific examples of these esters include dibutyl adipate, di(2-ethy!hexyi)sebacate, di-n-hexyl fumarate, dioctyi sebacate, diisooctyl azeiate, diisodecyl azeiate, dioctyi phthalate, didecyl phthalate, dieicosyl sebacate, the 2-ethylhexyl diester of linoleic acid dimer, the complex ester formed by reacting one mole of sebacic acid with two moles of tetraethylene glycol and two moles of 2-ethylhexanoic acid and the like. Esters useful as synthetic oils also include, but are not limited to, those made from carboxylic acids having from 5 to 12 carbon atoms with alcohols, e.g., methanol, ethanol, etc., polyols and polyol ethers such as neopentyl glycol, trimethyloi propane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritel, tripentaerythritol, and the like. Silicon-based oils such as, for example, polya!kyl-, polyaryh polyalkoxy- or poiyaryloxy-siloxane oils and silicate oils, comprise another useful class of synthetic lubricating oils. Specific examples of these include, but are not limited to, tetraethyl silicate, tetra-isopropyl silicate, tetra- {2-ethylhexyl}s!licate> tetra-(4-methyl~hexyl)silicate, tetra-(p-tert-butylphenyl)silicate, hexyl-(4- methyl~2~pentoxy)disiloxane, poly(mefhyl)siloxanes, poly(methylphenyl)siloxanes, and the like. Still yet other useful synthetic lubricating oils include, but are not limited to, liquid esters of phosphorous containing acids, e.g., tricresyl phosphate, trioclyl phosphate, diethyl ester of decane phosphionic acid, etc., polymeric tetrahydrofurans and the like. The oil of lubricating viscosity may be derived from unrefined, refined and rerefined oils, either natural, synthetic or mixtures of two or more of any of these of the type disclosed hereinabove, Unrefined oils are those obtained directly from a natural or synthetic source (e.g., coal, shale, or tar sands bitumen) without further purification or treatment. Examples of unrefined oils include, but are not limited to, a shale oil obtained directly from retorting operations, a petroleum oil obtained directly from distillation or an ester oil obtained directly from an esterification process, each of which is then used without further treatment. Refined oils are similar to the unrefined oils except they have been further treated in one or more purification steps to improve one or more properties. These purification techniques are known to those of skill in the art and include, for example, solvent extractions, secondary distillation, acid or base extraction, filtration, percolation, hydrotreating, dewaxing, etc. Rerefined oils are obtained by treating used oils in processes similar to those used to obtain refined oils. Such rerefined oils are also known as reclaimed or reprocessed oils and often are additionally processed by techniques directed to removal of spent additives and oil breakdown products. Lubricating oil base stocks derived from the hydroisomerization of wax may also be used, either alone or in combination with the aforesaid natural and/or synthetic base stocks. Such wax isomerate oil is produced by the hydroisomerization of natural or synthetic waxes or mixtures thereof over a hydroisomerization catalyst. Natural waxes are typically the slack waxes recovered by the solvent dewaxing of mineral oils; synthetic waxes are typically the wax produced by the Fischer-Tropseh process. The oil of lubricating viscosity for use in the lubricating oil compositions may be present in a major amount, e.g., an amount of greater than 50 wt. %, preferably greater than 70 wt, %, more preferably from 80 to 99.5 wt. % and preferably from 85 to 98 wt. %, based on the total weight of the composition. The reaction products of the present invention for use in the lubricating oil compositions of this invention can be used as a complete or partial replacement for commercially available antioxidants and detergents currently used in lubricant formulations and can be in combination with other additives typically found In motor oi!s. Generally, the reaction products of the present invention will be present in the lubricating oil compositions in an effective amount ranging from 0.1 to 15 wt, %, preferably from 0.1 wt. % to 10% wt. % and more preferably from 0.5 wt % to 5 wt. %, based on the total weight of the lubricating oil composition. If desired, other additives can be admixed with the foregoing lubricating oil compositions to enhance performance. When used in combination with other types of antioxidants or additives used in oil formu!ations, synergistic and/or additive performance effects may be obtained with respect to improved antioxidancy, antiwear, frictional and detergency and high temperature engine deposit properties. Such additives are well known. The lubricating oil additives typically found in lubricating oils are, for example, dispersants, detergents, corrosion/rust inhibitors, antioxidants, anti-wear agents, anti-foamants, friction modifiers, seal swell agents, emulsifiers, VI improvers, pour point depressants, and the like. The additives can be employed in the lubricating oil compositions at the usual levels in accordance with well known practice. Examples of dispersants include polylsobutylene succinimides, polylsobutylene succinate esters, annich Base ashless dispersants, and the like. Examples of detergents include metallic and ashless alkyl phenates, metallic and ashless sulfurized alkyl phenates, metallic and ashless alkyl sulfonates, metallic and ashless alkyl salicylates, metallic and ashless sa!igenin derivatives, and the like. Examples of other antioxidants include alkylated dsphenylamines, N-alkylated pheny!enediamines, phenyl-naphthylamine, alkylated phenyl-naphthyla ine, dimethyl quinolines, trimethyidihydroquino!ines and oligomeric compositions derived therefrom, hindered phenolics, alkylated hydroquinones, hydroxylaied thiodiphenyl ethers, aikylidenebisphenois, thiopropionates, metallic dithiocarbamates, 1 ,3,4-dimercaptothiadiazole and derivatives, oil soluble copper compounds, and the like. Examples of anti-wear additives that can be used in combination with the additives of the present invention include organo borates, organo phosphites, organo phosphates, organic sulfur-containing compounds, sulfurized olefins, sulfurized fatty acid derivatives (esters), chlorinated paraffins, zinc dialkyldithiophosphates, zinc diaryldithiophosphates, dialkyldithiophosphate esters, diary! diihiophosphate esters, phosphosulfurized hydrocarbons, and the like. Examples of friction modifiers include fatly acid esters and amides, organo molybdenum compounds, molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamates, molybdenum dialkyl dithiophosphates, molybdenum disulfide, tri-molybdenum cluster dialkyldithiocarbamates, non-sulfur molybdenum compounds and the like. An example of an anti-foam agent is polysiloxane, and the like. Examples of rust inhibitors are polyoxyalkylene polyol, benzotriazoie derivatives, and the like. Examples of VI improvers include olefin copolymers and dispersant olefin copolymers, and the like. An example of a pour point depressant is poiymethacrylate, and the like. The lubricating oil compositions of the present invention, when they contain these additives, are typically blended into a base oil in amounts such that the additives therein are effective to provide their normal attendant functions. When other additives are employed, it may be desirable, although not necessary, to prepare additive concentrates comprising concentrated solutions or dispersions of one or more of the reaction products of the present invention, together with one or more other additives whereby several additives can be added simultaneously to the base oil to form the lubricating oil composition. Dissolution of the additive concentrate into the lubricating oil can be facilitated by, for example, solvents and by mixing accompanied by mild heating, but this is not essential. The concentrate or additive-package will typically be formulated to contain the additives in proper amounts to provide the desired concentration in the final formulation when the additive- package is combined with a predetermined amount of base lubricant. Thus, the subject additives of the present invention can be added to small amounts of base oil or other compatible solvents along with other desirable additives to form additive-packages containing active ingredients in collective amounts of, typically, from 2.5 to 90 percent, preferably from 15 to 75 percent, and more preferably from 25 percent to 80 percent by weight additives in the appropriate proportions with the remainder being base oil. The final formulations can typically employ 1 to 20 weight percent of the additive-package with the remainder being base oil. All of the weight percentages expressed herein (unless otherwise indicated) are based on the active ingredient (A!) content of the additive, and/or upon the total weight of any additlve- package, or formulation, which will be the sum of the AS weight of each additive plus the weight of total oil or diluent. In general, the lubricating oil compositions of the present invention can contain the additives in a concentration ranging from 0.05 to 30 weight percent. A concentration range for the additives ranging from 0.1 to 10 weight percent based on the total weight of the oil composition is preferred. A more preferred concentration range is from 0.2 to 5 weight percent. In one embodiment, oil concentrates of the additives can contain from 1 to 75 weight percent of the additive in a carrier or diluent oil of lubricating oil viscosity. The present invention advantageously provides the lubricating oil compositions containing the reaction products of this invention as an additive which provides deposit protection in addition to oxidation-corrosion protection. The lubricating oil compositions can also provide such protection while having relatively low levels of phosphorous, e.g., less than 0.1%, preferably less than 0.08% and more preferably less than 0.05% by weight. Accordingly, the lubricating oil compositions of the present invention can be more environmentally desirable than the higher phosphorous lubricating oil compositions generally used in internal combustion engines because they facilitate longer catalytic converter life and activity while also providing the desired high deposit protection. This is due to the substantial absence of additives containing phosphorus compounds in these lubricating oil compositions. The reaction product for use herein may also protect against oxidation both in the presence of transition metals such as, for example, iron (Fe) and copper (Cu), etc., as well as in a metal free environment. The reaction products of the present invention are also useful as an additive for fuel compositions, e.g., as a friction modifier. The fuel can be any fuel, e.g., motor fuels such as diesel fuel and gasoline, kerosene, jet fuels, alcoholic fuels such as methanol or ethanol; marine bunker fuel, natural gas, home heating fuel or a mixture of any of the foregoing. When the fuel is diese!, such fuel generally boils above 212°F. The diesel fuel can comprise atmospheric distillate or vacuum distillate, or a blend in any proportion of straight run and thermally and/or catalytically cracked distillates. Preferred diesel fuels have a cetane number of at least 40, preferably above 45, and more preferably above 50. The diesel fuel can have such cetane numbers prior to the addition of any cetane improver. The cetane number of the fuel can be raised by the addition of a cetane improver. When the fuel is gasoline, it can be derived from straight-chain naphtha, polymer gasoline, natural gasoline, catalytica!ly cracked or thermally cracked hydrocarbons, catalytical!y reformed stocks, etc. It will be understood by one skilled in the art that gasoline fuels typically boil in the range of 80~45Q°F and can contain straight chain or branched chain paraffins, cycloparaffins, olefins, aromatic hydrocarbons, and any mixture of these. Generally, the composition of the fuel is not critical and any conventional motor fuel base can be employed in the practice of this invention. The proper concentration of the reaction products of the present invention that are necessary to achieve the desired result, e.g., friction modification, in fuel compositions is dependent upon a variety of factors including, for example, the type of fuel used, the presence of other additives, etc. Generally, however, the additive concentration of the reaction product of this invention in the base fuel can range from 10 to 5,000 parts per million and preferably from 50 to 1 ,000 parts per million of the additive per part of base fuel. If other friction modifiers are present, a lesser amount of the reaction product of the present invention may be used. If desired, one or more additional fuel additives may be incorporated into the fuel composition of the present invention. Such additives for use in the fuel additive and fuel compositions herein can be any presently known or later-discovered additive used in formulating fuel compositions. The fuel additives include, but are not limited to, detergents, cetane improvers, octane improvers, emission reducers, antioxidants, carrier fluids, metal deactivators, lead scavengers, rust inhibitors, bacteriostatic agents, corrosion inhibitors, antistatic additives, drag reducing agents, demulsifiers, dehazers, anti-icing additives, dispersants, combustion improvers and the like and mixtures thereof. A variety of the additives are known and commercially available. These additives, or their analogous compounds, can be employed for the preparation of the various fuel compositions herein. The additives may be employed in the fuel compositions at the usual levels in accordance with well known practice. The additives described herein may also be formulated as a fuel concentrate, using an inert stable oleophilic organic solvent boiling in the range of 150°F to a 400° F. An aliphatic or an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent is preferred, e.g., solvents such as benzene, toluene, xylene or higher-boiling aromatlcs or aromatic thinners. Aliphatic alcohols of 3 to 8 carbon atoms, e.g., isopropanol, isobuiylcarbsnol, n-butanol and the like, in combination with hydrocarbon solvents are also suitable for use with the fuel additive. In the fuel concentrate, the amount of the additive will be ordinari!y be 5 or more wt. % and generally not exceed 70 wt. %, preferably from 5 wt. % to 50 wt. % and more preferably from 10 wt, % to 25 wt. %, based on the total weight of the fuel composition.
