The cyclic polydi- t-?\k'::k. organosiloxanes have a formula (R2SiO) where each R is an %:kkp:J::::-:. alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a "$,3,3-trifluoropropyl 'V>vv;:':';;.;:':. radical and a is 3 or 4. $MU''"S''''" The cyclic polydiorganosiloxane or various mixtures :;V :;/:.::'.

Preferably ambient atmospheric conditions are used. MÊSÊWï However, temperatures up to and' including 50°C. can be used. W$ï£Èlf It would be possible to carry out this method at temperatures IgPMt higher than 50oC. , however, any advantages in ease of using ft:'5M'v the method and reduction in cost would be lost, since a l,;v:>;V closed system would be required and this would necessarily iK'-iï w"9 I increase the cost. The perfluoroacetoxy endblocked polydi- organosiloxanes are formed after a few minutes, however, times up to 24 hours and more can be used. Since the reaction proceeds readily at room temperature and no control is necessary, the mixtures can be placed in containers and left there until the resulting polymers are desired for use which could be several days or even weeks. The amount of perfluoroacetic anhydride is preferably from 1 to 20 parts by weight based on the weight of the cyclic polydiorganosiloxane. The method has the advantage of being inexpensive and easy to use. The resulting perfluoroacetoxy endblocked polydiorganosiloxanes can be used as such by using well-known cross-linkers to make room temperature vulcanizable silicone rubbers, or they can be hydrolyzed to provide hydroxyl end- blocked polydiorganosiloxanes, the utility of which is well known. These and many other uses are readily apparent to those skilled in the silicone art. The following examples are illustrative only and should not be construed as limiting the present invention which is properly delineated in the claims. Example 1 A mixture of 4.44 g. of {(CHsîsSiOJs and 5.92 g. of {(CHaJaSioK was prepared and to this mixture 0.5 g. of perfluoroacetic anhydride was added. The resulting mixture was exposed to 50$ relative humidity air at room temperature for 10 days. The resulting polymer was a perfluoroacetoxy endblocked polydimethylsiloxane having a viscosity of 81,100 cs. at 250C. Example 2 When a mixture of 10 g. of {(CHsUSicOs and 0.1 g. of perfluoroacetic anhydride is exposed to ambient air at room temperature for 5 days, a perfluoroacetoxy endblocked polydimethylsiloxane is obtained. Example 3 When a mixture of 10 g. of {{CH3)2SiO}4 and 2 g. of perfluoroacetic anhydride is exposed to ambient air at 500C. for 30 minutes, a perfluoroacetoxy endblocked polydi- methylsiloxane is obtained. Example k When a mixture of 10 g. of f(CPsCHaCHa)(CH3)Sio}3 and 1 g. of perfluoroacetic anhydride is exposed to 75 relative humidity air at 290C. for 24 hours, a perfluoro- acetoxy endblocked poly-J-trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane is obtained. Example When a mixture of 4 g. of {(CFsCHaCHa)(CH3)310)3, g. of {(CHsUSiOla, 1 g. of { (CH3CH2CHaCHaCH2CH2) (CŒSiOÎs and 0.75 g. of perfluoroacetic anhydride is exposed to ambient air at room temperature for 7 days, a perfluoroacetoxy end- blocked polydiorganosiloxane is obtained wherein the polydiorganosiloxane is composed of the following units: (CH3)2Si0, (CPsCHsCHa)(CH3)Si0 and (CHsCHeCHaCHsCHaCHs)(CHaJSiO.
