Example 2
Preparation of N-(3-acetamido-2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-chloro-5-((1R,3R)-2,2-dichloro-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamide (F1083)
To a solution of N-(3-amino-2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-chloro-5-((1R,3R)-2,2-dichloro-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamide (DP2) (0.06 g, 0.104 mmol) in pyridine (0.30 mL, 3.71 mmol) stirred at room temperature was added acetic anhydride (9.77 Î¼l, 0.104 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours, was quenched with water (3 mL), and was extracted with ethyl acetate (10 mL). The organic layer was washed with hydrochloric acid (1 N) and brine before being poured through a phase separator. The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure to give a residue. Purification by column chromatography using 0-30% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent afforded the title compound as a white solid (0.043 g, 67%).
