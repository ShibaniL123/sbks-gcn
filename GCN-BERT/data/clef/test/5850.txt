i0 IKEDOX-RESINS AND A PROCESS FOR TFOEiR PRODUCTION The invention relates to cross-llnked redox-resins and fo a process for their production by copolymerizlng vinyl anthraquinones with other monomers and compounds which comprise more than one vinyl group. It is known that the polymerization of 2-vinyl anthraquinone leads to products with reversible redox properties. The polymeric products are hydrophobie and insoluble in the conventional organic solvents, but the reduced form is dissolved in alkali. Sulfonation of the poly-2-vinyl anthraquinone thus produced leads to the degradation of the polymer. Copolymerizatlon in substance, for example, with styrene, produces resins with a maximum capacity of only about 1 mequiv./g.; this is caused by the limited solubility of 2-anthraquinone styrene. The copolymerization of vlnylanthraquinones with divinyl benzene in substance or in solution likewise leads only to nonuniform resins of low redox capacity (about 1 mequiv./g.). Copolymerlzatlon and cross-linklng in various solvents, such as benzene, toluene and alcohols, usually leads only to polymers in powder form and with low yields. This is because of the low solubility of the eopolymers of vinyl anthraquinones in the solvents employed. It has now been found that, when copolymerlzlng vinyl anthraquinones with other polymerlzable monovinyl compounds in dimethyl sulfoxlde, advantageously with the simultaneous use of monomers having a cross-linking action, Fedox resins are formed which are of homogeneous structure and are mechanically stable. Le A 7512 - 1 - i ¸ i0 2o 3o Using this process, the copolymerlzation preferably takes place at temperatures from i00 to 200° C. The vinyl anthraquinones are preferably l-vinyl and 2-vinyl anthraquinones as well as their substitution products. As copolymerizable monovinyl compounds, there are advantageously used aromatic monovinyl compounds, for example, styrene, methyl styrene, ethyl styrene and chlorostyrenes, while aromatic divinyl and polyvinyl compounds such as dlvinyl benzene or trivinyl benzene, are used as monomers with a cross-llnking action. It is expedient in this process that the ratio between vinyl anthraquinone and the sum of the comonomers does not exceed 2 : l. The copolymerization in dimethyl sulfoxide may be carried out in the presence of peroxides, p. e. of benzoylperoxide. Using the process according to the invention, resins which have a capacity of 3.5 mequiv./g, and higher are obtained in practically quantitative yield. Copolymerization in dimethyl sulfoxide without simultaneous cross-linking leads to very non-uniform mixtures of polymers of different composition. Ion-exchanging groups, such as sulfonic acid, carboxylic acid or phosphonic acid groups, can, if required, be introduced by known processes into the polymers which are obtained. Macroporous exchange resins, Which have the so-called sponge structure, can be obtained by adding non-solvents to the polymerization medium, i. e° by adding organic liquids which certainly dissolve or gel the monomers, but not the polymers. The sponge structure is maintained even after subsequent chemical reactions such as saponification o sulfonation. As non-solvents may be used alcohols, lower alkylester, ethers and aliphatic Le 7512 - 2 - ï 1.14 Z hydrocarbons, especially butylacetate, propylalcohol and heptane are employed. TT, e resins have relatively good chemical stability and show the lowest normal potential yet achieved. The dependence on pH is not disturbing, since the resins are stable at pH 14 up to a value of about ET = -700 mV. By variation O of the pH, it is thus possible to vary the reduction effect within wide IoEmits. By this means, a new field of application for redox resins is disc10 sed. Compared with condensation resins (Eo : about +700 mv) comprising these redox systems, these resins show a much lower nedox potential which was not immediately to be expected according to the existing state of the art. The following Examples show the production of polymers and copolymers which are based on 1-vinyl and 2-vinyl anthraquinones. Example 3 shows the production of a polymer having a sponge structure, butyl acetate being used as "non-solvent". Example I mMol of 2-vinyl anthraquinone (4.684 grams), 3.2 mMol of divinyl benzene (0.417 gram -AS mol.%), 2.08 mMol of ethyl styrene (0.275 gram) and 14.75 mMol of styrene (1.532 grams) were sealed in vacuo in a glass ampoule with I0 ml. of freshly distilled imethyl sulfoxide after repeated degasification and dissolved at 140° C. The ampoule was then heated for 165 hours at 140° C. in a drying chamber. After cooling, the dark brownish red, hard rod thus obtained was eomminuted, extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with methanol and the brownish yellow pieces were dried in vacuo at 50° C. The hard and brittle Le A_.7512 - 3 - !ii ii • 14».) i0 product was broken and screened. Example 2 4.7 grams of 2-vinyl anthraquinone, 0.42 gram of divinyl benzene, 0.275 gram of ethyl styrene and 1.54 grams of -methyl styrene were sealed in vacuo in a glass ampoule with i0 ml. of freshly distilled dimethyl sulfoxide after repeated degasification and dissolved at 140° C. The solution was heated for 165 hours at 140° C. in a drying chamber. After cooling, the dark brownish red, hard rod obtained was comminuted, completely extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with methanol and the brownish yellow pieces were dried in vacuo at 50° C. The hard and brittle product was broken and screened. Example 3 7.50 mMol of 2-vinyl anthraquinone (1.757 grams), 10.31 mMol of divinyl benzene (1.342 grams - 12.4 mol.%), 6.69 mMol of ethyl styrene (0.884 gram), lO0 mg. of benzoyl peroxide and 58.00 mMol of styrene (6.040 grams) were sealed in vacuo in a glass ampoule with 20.0 ml. of dimethyl sulfoxide-butyl acetate mixture (5 : 95) after degasification, dissolved at i00° C. and polymerized at 100° C. for 168 hours. The polymer had a macroporous sponge structure. The copolymers obtained can be sulfonated like polystyrene giving resins having limited swelling power in water and which show a reversible Zedox behaviour. They are stable over the entire pH range, both in the oxidized and reduced form. They have a behaviour similar to ordinary sulfonated polystyrene resins. They are not completely resistant to h relatively long action of Le A 7 12 - 4 - 690330 ï fO oxidizing agents (24 hours and longer) with an Eo> 0.7, but are slightly degraded to compounds soluble in alkali when in the reduced form. When the reduced form is treated in the K-form or H-form with air, H2 02 is formed, but thìs does not attack the resin with degradation. The following example shows the production of a sulfonated polymer. Example 4 5.47 grams of resin (graín size 0.1 - 0.5 mm.) were gelled for i hour in 50 ml. of dichlorethane, and thereafter, at room temperature, a mixture of 17.5 ml. of chlorosulfonic acid and 5.5 ml. of dichloethane was added dropwise within 30 minutes. After stirring for 24 hours at the same temperature, the substance was suction-filtered and the resin was carefully washed with dichlorethane. The resin was then heated with water for hydrolysis purposes for 2 hours at 60 - 70° C. The substance was again screened and brownish yellow resin grains were obtained. The resin was reduced in alkali with dithionite or sodium borhydride (in the presence of potassium ions), whereby it acquired a dark red color, and was washed with the reducing agent until ai1 soluble fractions, recognizable from their rid color, were removed. The resin was then washed free from reducing agent and acidified, becoming green in color. Oxidation was effected by means of ferric ions in twice-normal sulfuric acid; the use of ferric ions in twice-normal hydrochloric acid had a degrading action. The alr-dried resin had a water content of 30 per cent. The sulfonated copolymers (degree of sulfonation = i) are set out in the following Table 2 have the indicated Le A 7 1,2 - 5 - I cation exchanger capacities. The redox properties are given by the redox capacity with respect to ferric ions. The edox action is apparent from the redox normal potential, which is at about E° = 175 mV, as shown by titration with ceric ions. i0 Table 1 Molar ratio diQuantity Redox capacity m.equi./g.

The r edox process, on the contrary, is much slower. The reduction, e. g. with alkali dithionite or with alkali boron hydride, particularly in the presence of potassium ions, takes place comparatively quickly and can easily be recognized from the dark red coloring. After 24 hours, it is quantitatively complete. The quantitative oxidation proceeds much more slowly. About 60 % of the capacity is reached after 2 hours and 80 % of the capacity after 24 hours, whereas several weeks are necessary for complete oxidation. Example 4.7 grams of 1-vinyl anthraquinone, 0.42 gram of divinyl benzene, 0.275 gram of ethyl styrene and 1.30 grams of styrene were sealed in vacuo in a glass ampoule with i0 ml. of freshly distilled dimethyl sulfoxide after repeated degasification and dissolved at 140° C.
