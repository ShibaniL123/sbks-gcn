TECHNICAL FIELD [0002] The disclosure provides for metal organic frameworks (MOFs) which comprise a plurality of SBUs linked together by functionalized and/or multivariate BTB-based linking ligands. The disclosure further provides for the use of these MOFs in variety of applications, including for gas separation, gas storage, catalysis, and separation of compounds or bioproducts . BACKGROUND [0003] Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials that are constructed by linking metal clusters called Secondary Binding Units (SBUs) together with organic linking ligands. MOFs have high surface area and high porosity which enable them to be utilized in diverse fields, such as gas storage, catalysis, and sensors. SUMMARY [0004] The disclosure provides for MOFs which comprise a plurality of SBUs linked together by a plurality of functionalized 1,3,5- tris (4-carboxyphenyl) benzene (BTB) -based linking ligands. The disclosure also provides for a MOF disclosed herein being multivariate by being comprised of two or more differently functionalized BTB-based linking ligands (e.g., BTB and BTB-N02) . The material properties of the multivariate (mtv) -MOFs can be readily modified by changing the ratio of different types of organic linking ligands. A MOF of the disclosure may be topologically uniform (e.g., qom, rtl, or pyr net), while not being uniform in terms of the linking ligands all having the same structure. The structural tunability of the MOFs of the disclosure therefore allows for fine-tuning of the structural properties of the frameworks. Thus, MOFs can be synthesized to have certain properties and functionality in order to meet intended applications, such as for gas, liquid or vapor separation, gas storage, separation of bioproducts or compounds, or catalysis. In particular, it has been found that the MOFs of the disclosure have improved hydrogen and methane gas uptake in comparison to MOF-177 and other BTB-based frameworks. Accordingly, the MOFs of the disclosure are ideally suited for use as fuel gas storage materials in Absorbed Natural Gas (ANG) tanks, cylinders or the like for powering vehicles.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [ 0031 ] As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a, " "and, " and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "an organic linking ligand" includes a plurality of such linking ligands and reference to "the metal ion" includes reference to one or more metal ions and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth. [ 0032 ] Also, the use of "or" means "and/or" unless stated otherwise. Similarly, "comprise," "comprises," "comprising" "include, " "includes, " and "including" are interchangeable and not intended to be limiting. [ 0033 ] It is to be further understood that where descriptions of various embodiments use the term "comprising, " those skilled in the art would understand that in some specific instances, an embodiment can be alternatively described using language "consisting essentially of" or "consisting of." [ 0034 ] All publications mentioned throughout the disclosure are incorporated herein by reference in full for the purpose of describing and disclosing the methodologies, which are described in the publications, which might be used in connection with the description herein. The publications discussed above and throughout the text are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the inventors are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior disclosure. Moreover, with respect to similar or identical terms found in the incorporated references and terms expressly defined in this disclosure, the term definitions provided in this disclosure will control in all respects . [0035] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art. Although there are many methods and reagents similar or equivalent to those described herein, the exemplary methods and materials are presented herein. [0036] As used herein, a wavy line intersecting another line that is connected to an atom indicates that this atom is covalently bonded to another entity that is present but not being depicted in the structure. A wavy line that does not intersect a line but is connected to an atom indicates that this atom is interacting with another atom by a bond or some other type of identifiable association . [0037] A bond indicated by a straight line and a dashed line indicates a bond that may be a single covalent bond or alternatively a double covalent bond. But in the case where an atom's maximum valence would be exceeded by forming a double covalent bond, then the bond would be a single covalent bond. [0038] The term "alkyl", refers to an organic group that is comprised of carbon and hydrogen atoms that contain single covalent bonds between carbons. Typically, an "alkyl" as used in this disclosure, refers to an organic group that contains 1 to 30 carbon atoms, unless stated otherwise. Where if there is more than 1 carbon, the carbons may be connected in a linear manner, or alternatively if there are more than 2 carbons then the carbons may also be linked in a branched fashion so that the parent chain contains one or more secondary, tertiary, or quaternary carbons. An alkyl may be substituted or unsubstituted, unless stated otherwise. [0039] The term "alkenyl", refers to an organic group that is comprised of carbon and hydrogen atoms that contains at least one double covalent bond between two carbons. Typically, an "alkenyl" as used in this disclosure, refers to organic group that contains 1 to 30 carbon atoms, unless stated otherwise. While a Ci-alkenyl can form a double bond to a carbon of a parent chain, an alkenyl group of three or more carbons can contain more than one double bond. It certain instances the alkenyl group will be conjugated, in other cases an alkenyl group will not be conjugated, and yet other cases the alkenyl group may have stretches of conjugation and stretches of nonconj ugation . Additionally, if there is more than 1 carbon, the carbons may be connected in a linear manner, or alternatively if there are more than 3 carbons then the carbons may also be linked in a branched fashion so that the parent chain contains one or more secondary, tertiary, or quaternary carbons. An alkenyl may be substituted or unsubstituted, unless stated otherwise. [ 0040 ] The term "alkynyl", refers to an organic group that is comprised of carbon and hydrogen atoms that contains a triple covalent bond between two carbons. Typically, an "alkynyl" as used in this disclosure, refers to organic group that contains 1 to 30 carbon atoms, unless stated otherwise. While a Ci-alkynyl can form a triple bond to a carbon of a parent chain, an alkynyl group of three or more carbons can contain more than one triple bond. Where if there is more than 1 carbon, the carbons may be connected in a linear manner, or alternatively if there are more than 4 carbons then the carbons may also be linked in a branched fashion so that the parent chain contains one or more secondary, tertiary, or quaternary carbons. An alkynyl may be substituted or unsubstituted, unless stated otherwise. [ 0041 ] The term "aryl", as used in this disclosure, refers to a conjugated planar ring system with delocalized pi electron clouds that contain only carbon as ring atoms. An "aryl" for the purposes of this disclosure encompass from 1 to 12 aryl rings wherein when the aryl is greater than 1 ring the aryl rings are joined so that they are linked, fused, or a combination thereof. An aryl may be substituted or unsubstituted, or in the case of more than one aryl ring, one or more rings may be unsubstituted, one or more rings may be substituted, or a combination thereof. [ 0042 ] The term "cluster" refers to identifiable associations of 2 or more atoms. Such associations are typically established by some type of bond-ionic, covalent, Van der Waal, coordinate and the like. [ 0043 ] The term "cycloalkyl", as used in this disclosure, refers to an alkyl that contains at least 3 carbon atoms but no more than 12 carbon atoms connected so that it forms a ring. A "cycloalkyl" for the purposes of this disclosure encompass from 1 to 12 cycloalkyl rings, wherein when the cycloalkyl is greater than 1 ring, then the cycloalkyl rings are joined so that they are linked, fused, or a combination thereof. A cycloalkyl may be substituted or unsubstituted, or in the case of more than one cycloalkyl ring, one or more rings may be unsubstituted, one or more rings may be substituted, or a combination thereof. [ 0044 ] The term "cycloalkenyl" , as used in this disclosure, refers to an alkene that contains at least 3 carbon atoms but no more than 12 carbon atoms connected so that it forms a ring. A "cycloalkenyl" for the purposes of this disclosure encompass from 1 to 12 cycloalkenyl rings, wherein when the cycloalkenyl is greater than 1 ring, then the cycloalkenyl rings are joined so that they are linked, fused, or a combination thereof. A cycloalkenyl may be substituted or unsubstituted, or in the case of more than one cycloalkenyl ring, one or more rings may be unsubstituted, one or more rings may be substituted, or a combination thereof. [ 0045 ] The term "framework" as used herein, refers to a highly ordered structure comprised of secondary building units (SBUs) that can be linked together in defined, repeated and controllable manner, such that the resulting structure is characterized as being porous, periodic and crystalline. Typically, "frameworks" are two dimensional (2D) or three dimensional (3D) structures. Examples of "frameworks" include, but are not limited to, "metal-organic frameworks" or "MOFs", "zeolitic imidazolate frameworks" or "ZIFs", or "covalent organic frameworks " or "COFs". While MOFs and ZIFs comprise SBUs of metals or metal ions linked together by forming covalent bonds with linking clusters on organic linking moieties, COFs are comprised of SBUs of organic linking moieties that are linked together by forming covalent bonds via linking clusters. "Frameworks" are highly ordered and extended structures that are not based upon a centrally coordinated ion, but involve many repeated secondary building units (SBUs) linked together. Accordingly, "frameworks" are orders of magnitude much larger than coordination complexes and have different structural and chemical properties due to the framework's open and ordered structure . [0046] The term "functional group" or "FG" refers to specific groups of atoms within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of those molecules. While the same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reaction (s) regardless of the size of the molecule it is a part of, its relative reactivity can be modified by nearby functional groups. The atoms of functional groups are linked to each other and to the rest of the molecule by covalent bonds. Examples of FG that can be used in this disclosure, include, but are not limited to, substituted or unsubstituted alkyls, substituted or unsubstituted alkenyls, substituted or unsubstituted alkynyls, substituted or unsubstituted aryls, substituted or unsubstituted hetero-alkyls, substituted or unsubstituted hetero-alkenyls, substituted or unsubstituted hetero-alkynyls, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyls, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkenyls , substituted or unsubstituted hetero-aryls , substituted or unsubstituted heterocycles , halos, hydroxyls, anhydrides, carbonyls, carboxyls, carbonates, carboxylates, aldehydes, haloformyls, esters, hydroperoxy, peroxy, ethers, orthoesters, carboxamides , amines, imines, imides, azides, azos, cyanates, isocyanates, nitrates, nitriles, isonitriles, nitrosos, nitros, nitrosooxy, pyridyls, sulfhydryls, sulfides, disulfides, sulfinyls, sulfos, thiocyanates, isothiocyanates , carbonothioyls, phosphinos, phosphonos, phosphates, Si (OH) 3, Ge(OH)3, Sn(OH)3, Si(SH)4, Ge(SH)4, As03H, As04H, P(SH)3, As(SH)3, S03H, Si (OH) 3, Ge(OH)3, Sn (OH) 3, Si(SH)4, Ge(SH)4, Sn(SH)4, As03H, As04H, P(SH)3, and As(SH)3. [0047] The term "heterocycle" , as used in this disclosure, refers to ring structures that contain at least 1 non-carbon ring atom. A "heterocycle" for the purposes of this disclosure encompass from 1 to 12 heterocycle rings wherein when the heterocycle is greater than 1 ring the heterocycle rings are joined so that they are linked, fused, or a combination thereof. A heterocycle may be a hetero-aryl or nonaromatic, or in the case of more than one heterocycle ring, one or more rings may be nonaromatic, one or more rings may be hetero-aryls , or a combination thereof. A heterocycle may be substituted or unsubstituted, or in the case of more than one heterocycle ring one or more rings may be unsubstituted, one or more rings may be substituted, or a combination thereof. Typically, the non-carbon ring atom is N, 0, S, Si, Al, B, or P. In case where there is more than one non-carbon ring atom, these non-carbon ring atoms can either be the same element, or combination of different elements, such as N and 0.

While the various BTB-based linking ligands depicted herein (e.g., Formula I) are shown with carboxylic acid based linking clusters, it would be understood by one of skill in the art that these carboxylic acid groups undergo condensation to form one or more bonds to a metal or metal ion of the SBUs in order to link the SBUs together in the framework. For example, the carboxylic acid groups could be understood as having the generalized structure of: when condensed with one or more metal ions to make a MOF of the disclosure . [0063] Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) composed of polymetallic inorganic clusters and polytopic organic linkers are crystalline porous materials that can be tailored by modifying the metal, linking ligand and substituents thereof, such that the interior can be systematically modified for rationally optimizing their performance in gas separation, gas storage, and other applications. The diversity and heterogeneity of MOFs can be greatly expanded by introducing different functional groups and varying the ratios of multiple functionalities in one crystal, which has offered an exclusive opportunity to make materials with desired complexity or sequence. MOFs with hetero ( 6 , 3 ) -coordinated qom net (see FIG . 1 ) are generated from isoreticular functionalization, topological isomerization, and multivariate heterogeneity of octahedral inorganic SBU' s (e.g., Zn40(COO")6) linked together with BTB-based linking ligands. [0064] In synthesizing the MOFs of the disclosure, several challenges had to be overcome including, but not limited to, (1) linkers have to be generated with various functional groups; (2) the structural fidelity of the inorganic SBUs have to be maintained in- situ when using linkers with different functional groups; (3) the topology of the network resulting from linking octahedral inorganic SBU with tritopic linkers has to be resolved; and (4) the activation procedure has to be optimized in order to produce activated MOFs with high porosity. [0065] Provided herein is a versatile synthetic route to efficiently prepare BTB derivatives with various functional groups. As shown in FIG. 2, nine examples of BTB derivatives (from B to J) comprising different types and/or number of functional groups were utilized to synthesize the MOFs of the disclosure. For example, in one embodiment, a hetero-functionalized BTB derivative (K) , possessing three different functional groups on one linker was realized through multiple steps of coupling reactions. The disclosure also provides nine MOFs comprising BTB-based linking moieties with various organic groups (e.g., amino, fluoro, methyl, methoxy, benzyloxy, and fused benzene) that were successfully isolated as single crystals, and which were further characterized by single-crystal diffraction (SCXRD) , powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) , thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) , and sorption measurements. Several topological isomers of the MOFs disclosed herein were encountered in the screening reactions, by SCXRD and PXRD. A series of multivariate (MTV) MOFs comprising different numbers and varieties of BTB-based linking ligands, including varying the ratios between the linking ligands, were also characterized by SCXRD, PXRD, TGA and sorption measurements . [0066] The disclosure provides for MOFs that comprise a plurality of SBUs linked together by a plurality of functionalized 1 , 3 , 5-tris (4-carboxyphenyl ) benzene (BTB) -based linking ligands. The disclosure also provides for a MOF of the disclosure being multivariate by comprising two or more BTB-based linking ligands having different structures. As demonstrated herein, the material properties of these multivariate MOFs can be modified by changing the ratio between multiple types of differently functionalized BTB- based linking ligands. In yet another embodiment, the disclosure provides for MOFs of the disclosure which comprise SBUs that are linked by two or more types of differently functionalized BTB-based linking ligands, wherein the different types of functional groups on the BTB-based linking ligands modify the chemical and physical properties of a MOF of the disclosure.

In particular embodiment, the disclosure provides for MOFs that can be tuned to adsorb a specific gas or multiple gases from mixed gas stream. For example, a MOF disclosed herein that is comprised of multiple types of BTB-based linking ligands can provide functional groups that have differential binding/interaction characteristics for specific gas molecules. Further, in comparison to other BTB-based frameworks, such as MOF- 177, the MOFs of the disclosure have enhanced adsorption affinities and stabilities for fuel energy gases, such as hydrogen and methane, which allows for use of the MOFs in high density storage applications at lower pressures, such as in Absorbed Natural Gas (ANG) tanks for vehicles and other equipment. [ 0093 ] In one embodiment of the disclosure, a gas storage or gas separation material comprising a MOF of the disclosure is provided. Advantageously, a MOF of the disclosure includes a number of adsorption sites for storing and/or separating gas molecules. Suitable examples of such gases include, but are not limited to, gases comprising ammonia, argon, methane, propane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, phosphine, nitrous oxide, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, chlorine, helium, carbonyl sulfide, and combinations thereof.

[0094] The disclosure also provides an apparatus and method for separating one or more components from a multi-component gas using a separation system having a feed side and an effluent side separated by a MOF of the disclosure. The apparatus may comprise a column separation format. [0095] A MOF of the disclosure can be used as an adsorbent for methane.

In another embodiment, a gas separation device comprises a MOF of the disclosure. In a further embodiment, a gas separation device used to separate one or more component gases from a multi-component gas mixture comprises a MOF disclosed herein. Examples of gas separation and/or gas storage devices include, but are not limited to, purifiers, filters, scrubbers, pressure swing adsorption devices, molecular sieves, hollow fiber membranes, ceramic membranes, cryogenic air separation devices, and hybrid gas separation devices. In a certain embodiment, a gas separation device used to separate methane and/or hydrogen from a mixed gas stream comprises a MOF of the disclosure. [0097] In a particular embodiment of the disclosure, a gas storage material comprises a MOF disclosed herein. A gas that may be stored or separated by the methods, compositions and systems of the disclosure includes gases selected from the group consisting of ammonia, argon, methane, propane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, phosphine, nitrous oxide, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, chlorine, helium, carbonyl sulfide, and combinations thereof. In a particularly useful variation a gas storage material is a hydrogen storage material that is used to store hydrogen (¾) . In another particularly useful variation, a gas storage material is a methane storage material that may be used to store methane . [0098] In a certain embodiment, a MOF of the disclosure can be used as heterogeneous catalysts. A MOF can be synthesized to have catalytic activity or be functionalized post-synthetically with a post-framework reactant to become catalytic. Catalytic activities would include, but are not limited to, hydrolysis reactions, oxidations, reductions, ring closure reactions, metathesis reactions, and isomerizations . [0099] In another embodiment, a MOF of the disclosure can be used as a sensor. For example, a MOF of the disclosure can adsorb or absorb to an analyte gas of interest and which upon binding to the analyte undergo a detectable change that can be measure by a transducer thereby indicating the presence of an absorbed analyte. For example, the disclosure provides a MOF of the disclosure comprising a porous frameworks that can be used in any number of sensor modalities comprising different transducers for measuring a detectable signal. Chemically-sensitive resistor, for example, can be used wherein the sensing region comprises a porous framework of the disclosure either alone or in combination with other conductive or non-conductive materials. In this embodiment, a MOF of the disclosure that is conductive and that absorbs or adsorbs and analytes of interest separates to conductive leads. When an analyte is absorbed or adsorbed by the MOF, the conductivity across the MOF changes. Such sensors can be used in a sensing array. The change in the electrical resistance of a chemically-sensitive resistor in such a sensing array can be related to the sorption of a molecule of interest to the porous framework. [ 00100 ] Other sensor modalities include acoustic wave, capacitance and optical transduction methods . Acoustic wave sensors measure an absorbed material by change in the vibrational frequency of the sensor (e.g., a sensor comprising a MOF of the disclosure) . For instance, an acoustic wave sensor may have a first vibrational frequency in the absence of a bound analyte and a second different frequency in the presence of the bound analyte. Measuring such changes in vibrational frequency can be performed in the methods and compositions of the disclosure wherein the sensor comprises a MOF and wherein the MOF changes mass (thus vibrational frequency) when the material binds an analyte. [ 00101 ] Similarly, the presence of a bound analyte can be measured optically. In optical transduction modalities the optical properties are measured in a MOF prior to contact with an analyte and then subsequent to contact with the analyte. Light diffusion through a sensor material can be detected or a change in the color of the material may be detected. [ 00102 ] Another type of sensor includes, for example, a sensor that undergoes a volume change in response to an analyte species. As the sensors are modulated in size the sensor material changes with respect to mass or optics. For example, the light diffraction indicates the presence or absence of the analyte that causes the sensing material to change. In this embodiment, the sensor material comprises a MOF of the disclosure that can be functionalized for binding an analyte of interest either reversibly or irreversibly. [ 00103 ] Yet another type of sensor includes those wherein the sensors produce a spectral recognition patterns when an analyte is present. In this embodiment the porous sensor material changes in optical properties, whether by density or through a change in emission, excitation or absorbance wavelengths. [ 00104 ] Any number of sensor combinations comprising a MOF of the disclosure or any number of transduction modalities can be used. For example, each individual sensor can provide a signal (e.g., a transduced signal indicative of the presence of an analyte) or a plurality of signals from an array of sensors can be used to identify an analyte of interest in a fluid. The signal transduction mechanism through which the analyte or molecule produces a signal is potentially quite broad. These include arrays of surface acoustic wave devices, quartz crystal micro-balances, dye-coated fiber optics, resistometric, electrochemical, and others modalities readily identifiable to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, transduction mechanisms include, for example optical, electrical, and/or resonance. [ 00105 ] By "differentially responsive sensors" is meant any number of sensors comprising a MOF of the disclosure that respond (e.g., transducer a signal) to the presence or interaction of an analyte with the sensor. Such measurable changes include changes in optical wavelengths, transparency of a sensor, resonance of a sensor, resistance, diffraction of light and/or sound, and other changes easily identified to those skilled in the art. [ 00106] The disclosure also provides methods using a MOF disclosed herein. In a certain embodiment, a method to separate or store one or more gases comprises contacting one or more gases with a MOF of the disclosure. In a further embodiment, a method to separate or store one or more gases from a mixed gas mixture comprises contacting the gas mixture with a MOF disclosed herein. In a certain embodiment, a method to separate or store one or more gases from a fuel gas stream comprises contacting the fuel gas stream with a MOF disclosed herein. In a further embodiment, a method to separate or store methane from a natural gas stream comprises contacting the natural gas stream with a MOF disclosed herein. In a certain embodiment, a method to separate or store one or more gases from flue-gas comprises contacting the flue-gas with a MOF disclosed herein. In an alternate embodiment, a MOF disclosed herein can be used to separate compounds or bioproducts from other products or solvents. Examples of such separation include the use of the MOFs disclosed herein in size exclusion chromatography, affinity chromatography, or as molecular sieves. [ 00107 ] Sorption is a general term that refers to a process resulting in the association of atoms or molecules with a target material. Sorption includes both adsorption and absorption. Absorption refers to a process in which atoms or molecules move into the bulk of a porous material, such as the absorption of water by a sponge. Adsorption refers to a process in which atoms or molecules move from a bulk phase (that is, solid, liquid, or gas) onto a solid or liquid surface. The term adsorption may be used in the context of solid surfaces in contact with liquids and gases. Molecules that have been adsorbed onto solid surfaces are referred to generically as adsorbates, and the surface to which they are adsorbed as the substrate or adsorbent. Adsorption is usually described through isotherms, that is, functions which connect the amount of adsorbate on the adsorbent, with its pressure (if gas) or concentration (if liquid) . In general, desorption refers to the reverse of adsorption, and is a process in which molecules adsorbed on a surface are transferred back into a bulk phase. In a preferred embodiment, a MOF of the disclosure is used as adsorbent for natural gas in Absorbed Natural Gas (ANG) tank. [ 00108 ] MOFs of the disclosure can be used as standard compounds for sorption instruments, and obtained results would be helpful to improve various industrial plants (i.e. separation or recovery of chemical substance) . [ 00109 ] In a variation of this embodiment, the gaseous storage site comprises a MOF with a pore which has been functionalized with a group having a desired size or charge. In a refinement, this activation involves removing one or more chemical ligands (guest molecules) from a MOF disclosed herein. Typically, such guest molecules include species such as water, solvent molecules contained within a MOF disclosed herein, and other chemical ligands having electron density available for attachment. [ 00110 ] A MOFs used in the embodiments of the disclosure include a plurality of pores for gas adsorption. In one variation, the plurality of pores has a unimodal size distribution. In another variation, the plurality of pores have a multimodal (e.g., bimodal) size distribution. [ 00111 ] The following examples are intended to illustrate but not limit the disclosure. While they are typical of those that might be used, other procedures known to those skilled in the art may alternatively be used.

[ 00115 ] Thermal gravimetric analysis: TGA curves were recorded on a TA Q500 thermal analysis system at a heating rate of 5 °C/min under N2 flow. [ 00116 ] Isotherm analysis: Ultra-high-purity grade N2, ¾, CH4, CO2 and He gases (Praxair, 99.999% purity) were used for the adsorption measurements.

The design of BTB derivatives can be classified depending on different functionalized positions (Xx-X4) H3BTB Derivatives Most of BTB based linking ligands were functionalized on the X3 position with different functional groups (B, C, D, E, H, and I), while one linker was functionalized on the X2 position (J) . Linker F and G were simultaneously functionalized on X3/X4 and X2/X3 positions, respectively. The functional groups included amino, fluoro, methyl, methoxy, benzyloxy, and fused benzene groups. The functional group effects on the topology control, heterogeneity formation, and adsorption behavior of the resulting MOFs can therefore be comprehensively studied. [00118] Synthesis of BTB-based linking ligands : Homotopically functionalized BTB linkers can be synthesized through a versatile route by coupling the 1, 3, 5-tris (4, 4, 5, 5-tetramethyl-l, 3, 2- dioxaborolan-2-yl) benzene with methyl-4-bromobenzoate analogs bearing desired functionalities, which were further hydrolyzed and acidified to provide the acid forms of the linkers (see SCHEME 1) . SCHEME 1. General synthetic route of homotopically functionalized BTB linkers; - = -NH2 , -F , -Me, -OMe, -OBn, -N02, and etc. [00119] Heterotopically functionalized BTB linkers can be prepared by coupling sequentially of three different (4- (methoxycarbonyl ) -phenyl ) -boronic acids or esters onto a tribromobenzene or 1 , 3-dibromo-5-iodobenzene (see SCHEME 2). This strategy is illustrated by the synthesis of a heterotopic BTB derivative, H3BTBNH2-Nap (see FIG. 2K) . Dioxane / H20 Dioxane / H20 (v:v = 2 : 1) (v:v = 2 : 1) SCHEME 2. Stepwise synthetic route of heterotopically functionalized BTB linkers (i.e.; = H, ' = Nap, R' ' = NH2) . [ 00120 ] Scheme 3 provides a further depiction of the synthesis rout for organic linkers based upon Suzuki-Miyaura cross-cpuling reactions. For example, the syntheses of the acid forms of BTB derivative organic linkers with various functional groups are based on the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions to produce their ester forms with further saponification and acidification. There are two routes to synthesize the ester form of organic linkers: (1) Synthesize different (4- (methoxycarbonyl ) phenyl ) oronic acids (or their pinacol esters) with desired functional group on them, and further coupling with 1,3,5- tribromobenzene ; and (2) Synthesize the 1 , 3, 5-tris (boronic pinacol ester) benzene, and coupling with different functionalized 4- bromobenzoate esters, which are more commercial available leading to less synthetic work. In the experiments described herein both routes wer eused depending on the convenience of getting the functionalized (4- (methoxycarbonyl) phenyl) boronic acids (or their pinacol esters), but most of them can be synthesized adopting the synthetic route 2.

Crystals of IRMOF-177 were generally isolated from solvothermal reactions of Ζη(Ν03> 2 * 6¾0 and the acid form of a functionalized BTB linker in DEF, which are similar to the conditions previously used in the preparation of original MOF-177. To obtain highly crystalline samples and avoid contamination from isomeric phases of MOFs, reaction conditions of some IRMOF-177 analogs were slightly modified by changing the temperature, concentration, organic solvent, and so on .

After decanting the mother liquor, yellow block crystals were isolated and washed three times with fresh DMF (10 mL) . [ 00158 ] Synthesis of MTV MOF-177 variants. mtv-MOF-177 variants were synthesized though solvothermal reactions and isolated as single-crystal forms. The structural and physical characteristics of the multivariate MOFs are dependent upon the particular combination of different kinds of linking ligands, and by the stoichiometric control of ratio of different linking ligands. MTV MOF-177 variants were synthesized with different combinations of BTB and functionalized BTB-based linkers. The ratio of BTB to functionalized linker was also adjusted. Illustrated herein, is the synthesis and characterization of a binary MTV-MOF-177 having stoichiometric ratio of H3BTB and H3BTB-6F of 1:1. [ 00159 ] MTV-MOF-177-AG, ZnO (BTB) (BTB-6F) : H3BTB (25 mg, 0.057 mmol) and H3BTB-6F (31 mg, 0.057 mmol) were dissolved with 9 mL DEF in a 20-mL vial, and then added with Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (250 mg, 0.84 mmol in 1 mL DEF) . The mixture was sonicated for 30 min, and then heat at 100 °C in an isothermal oven. Block colorless crystals were obtained after 16 hours. [ 00160 ] Activation methods of MOF-177 analogs. Although MOF-177 can be full activated using the established protocol involving solvent-exchange and evacuation with heating, the supercritical CO2 drying (SCD) protocol is worth employing in the optimization activation due to the better performance in many ultrahigh surface area MOFs. In this study, different activation methods were tried and optimized using the rough uptake of N2, prior to taking the full adsorption measurement. [ 00161 ] Established protocol: As-synthesized samples of MOF-177 analogs were immersed in chloroform or dichloromethane (15 mL in a 20-mL vial) for three days, during which time the solvent was decanted and freshly replenished three times per day. The suspension of crystals was then transferred to an adsorption cell using glass pipette to avoid direct exposure to humidity. After the removal of bulk solvent in the cell using syringe with a long, the sample was maintained in vacuo at room temperature for 2 hours. The sample was then heated to 100 °C using a constant rate of 2 °C/min over a period of 12 hours. The sample was cooled to room temperature and backfilled with Ar before taking the adsorption measurement. [ 00162 ] SCD protocol: As-synthesized samples of MOF-177 analogs were exchanged with acetone for three days, as indicated above. Wrapping with Kimwipe® paper in an extraction thimble, the wet sample was transferred to the chamber of a Tousimis Samdri PVT-3D critical point dryer, where the MOFs were immersed in liquid CO2 and changed with fresh liquid CO2 for five times. After heating to 30-45 °C in order to reach the supercritical state, the sample was maintained at this temperature for a half hour, and the CO2 was bled off as gas at a rate of 2 mL/min. The sample was then transferred to sorption cell in a glovebox, and maintained in vacuo at room temperature for 12 hours before taking sorption measurements. [ 00163 ] Isoreticular syntheses of functionalized MOF-177 analogs. As shown in FIG. 4A-I, all functionalized H3BTB derivatives, except the H3BTB-NO2 linker, can produce isoreticular frameworks with the expected qom topology of MOF-177. All the IRMOF-177 analogs possess the same octahedral inorganic SBU, Zn40(COO") 6, linked by tritopic organic linkers to form the extended 3D frameworks. They differ in the linker conformation, nature of functional group decorating the pores, and in the metrics of their pore structure. IRMOF-177-B, -C, -F and -I comprise small sized functional groups. Their pore volumes were calculated from their structures to be around 1.70 cm3/g (see TABLE 1), which is slightly lower than that of MOF-177 (1.88 cm3/g) . [ 00164 ] TABLE 1. Crystallographic information of IRMOF-177 analogs and calculated porosity behavior. [ 00165 ] In the structure of IRMOF-177-I, the three branched benzene rings are perpendicular to the centered benzene, which can be attributed to the significant steric hindrance resulting from substitution at the X2 position. A geometric calculation shows the accessible surface area of IRMOF-177-I to be around 4805 m2/g, which is greater than the other functionalized BTB-based analogs and MOF- 177 (4796 m2/g) . IRMOF-177-D, -F, and -K with slightly bulkier functional groups have a pore volume in the region 1.53-1.50 cm2/g; IRMOF-177-E and -G with very large bulky functional groups have the pore volume of 0.93 and 1.36, respectively. Although bulkier functional groups reduce pore volume, the polarization of pore surfaces and partitioning of pore size may enhance their adsorptive ability along with their higher surface area. [ 00166] Troubleshooting with topological isomerization in reticular functionalization of MOF-177. The first syntheses of MOF- 177-F, resulted in the isolation of cubic shape crystals when using the general synthetic conditions. By comparing the PXRD patterns with MOF-177, these synthesized MOFs were of a different phase. SCXRD analysis demonstrated that the synthesized MOFs had the same octahedral Zn40(COO") 6 inorganic SBUs and the same connectivity of the BTB-6F linkers, but were in a doubly interpenetrating pyr net. Disregarding the solvents in the crystals, this MOF is a topological isomer to MOF-177-6F. The expected qom net was finally obtained by using lower temperatures and concentrations. [ 00167 ] Needle crystals were obtained in the first trials to make MOF-177-J. Its single-crystal structure represents a 3D extended framework composed of the same Zn40(COO") 6 SBU and the same BTB-mNlH linker, but resulted in the rtl net. The conformation of the BTB- mNH2 linker was different than the normal BTB linker, in that the two of the carboxylate groups have a large twist angle of 56° to the centered benzene ring, and one carboxylate group is in the same plane with the centered benzene ring. This MOF possesses high porosity with 80.0 % void, and a low framework density of 0.41 g/cm3. The pore volume (2.0 cm3/g) and accessible surface area (4918 m2/g) are also higher than MOF-177. [ 00168 ] As shown in FIG. 5, there are several possible networks composed of alternating octahedron and triangle SBUs. The pyr net has been observed in the doubly interpenetrated MOF-150 with the 4 , 4 ' , 4 ' ' -nitrilotribenzoate (TCA) linker, but this is the first instance of a pyr net with a BTB-based ligand. The tsx and ant net were discovered in MOFs synthesized from the reaction of H3BTB with Zn (N03) 2 * 4H20 in DMF or DMF/EtOH/H20. These examples reveal that the frameworks are not only influenced by the geometries of SBUs, but also by linker conformation and synthesis conditions. Therefore, based upon the functionalization of the BTB-based linkers, the kinetics of crystal growth is affected, leading to different thermally dynamically stable forms. Examples of possible nets for MOFs using the BTB-based linking ligands disclosed herein are presented in TABLE 2. [ 00169 ] TABLE 2. Possible nets of alternatively linked octahedron and triangle in the RCSR database . [ 00170 ] High-symmetry structures are common to MOFs, which result from using geometric SBUs and the enumeration of periodic networks. However, structural uncertainty still remains when the MOFs are comprised of linking differently shaped SBUs. The phenomenon of supramolecular isomerism has attracted great interest in coordination chemistry and crystal engineering. In particular, how ligand conformation affects supramolecular assembly and crystal growth. The disclosure therefore provides an opportunity to better understand the processes involved in forming different networks from the same components . [ 00171 ] Systematical syntheses of MTV-MOF-177 variants. A series of MTV-MOF-177 variants were prepared. First prepared were the binary MTV-MOFs, which were formed by mixing the H3BTB linker with functionalized BTB derivatives with varying linker stoichiometries . The resulting linker ratios in the crystals were characterized by solution NMR of digested samples (see TABLE 3 ) . [ 00172 ] TABLE 3. Ratio of linkers in MTV-MOF-177 crystals of different combinations with varying reaction stoichiometries (ratios are shown in parentheses) determined by ID solution 1H NMR spectroscopy of the digested samples. In each case, the ratios were normalized to a value of one for linker A. N/A, not applicable; MP, mixed phases . [ 00173 ] The disclosure illustrate the case of binary MTV-MOF-177- F series. As shown in FIG. 7B, when utilizing a H3BTB-6F linker ratio of 8:2, mixed phases were observed at 85 °C. This phase separation problem was solved by using lower reaction temperatures. The output linker ratios of MTV-MOF-177-F in region with qom pure phase are consistent for both temperatures. The input-output ratio shows a bias curve, which may be attributed to the different pKa value, steric hindrance and coordination kinetics between the linkers . [ 00174 ] Ternary MTV-MOF-177 variants were also prepared. FIG. 8 presents an analysis the linker ratio of MTV-MOF-177-ABG based upon a ID solution XH NMR spectrum of a digested sample (10 mg sample was dissolved in 600 DMSO-d6 with 20 25% HC1 in D20) . The overlapping multiple peaks at 8.05 ppm can all be assigned to the protons on the BTB linker, which have to be integrated together as one (for 15 protons) . The singlet at 7.60 ppm was assigned to proton g on the centered benzene ring of BTB-NH2; the doublet at 7.43 ppm (J = 7.9 Hz) was assigned to proton f next to the amino group; the multiplet at 7.93 ppm was assigned to proton d and e, which may have overlapping with that of DMF at 7.96 ppm marked with asterisk. The doublet at 8.93 ppm (J = 8.7 Hz) was assigned to proton i from BTB- Nap, multiplet at 8.19 ppm was assigned to proton n and k with overlapping; doublet at 7.76 ppm (J = 7.9 Hz) was assigned to proton j; singlet at 7.72 ppm was assigned to proton h, which is overlapped with pentalet of proton i and m at 7.68 ppm. The characteristic peak was selected without overlapping for integration, and the resulting ratio was calculated as 1:0.32:0.62 for BTB : BTB-NH2 : BTB-Nap . [ 00175 ] Permanent porosity and adsorption capacity. Permanent porosity of IRMOF-177 analogs was confirmed by N2 adsorption experiments at 77 K. All the examined analogs showed significant N2 uptake at low-pressure (P/Po < 0.05), whose profiles can be classified as type I isotherms (See FIG. 15) . IRMOF-177-B and -I have the larger DR pore volume (1.63 and 1.68 cm3/g, respectively) than that of IRMOF-D and -F (1.53 cm3/g for -F) . The BET surface areas of IRMOF-177-B, -D, -F and -I are 3800, 2330, 3688, and 3478 m2/g, respectively. [ 00176] Permanent porosity of MTV-MOF-177 series was also characterized by N2 adsorption experiments at 77 K. As shown in FIG. 16A, by varying the stoichiometry, the porosity of the MOFs can be modified. The H2 uptake of MTV-MOF-177-AG (5:5) increased in comparison to MOF-177 and IRMOF-177-G (see FIG. 16B) . [ 00177 ] A number of embodiments have been described herein.
