FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates generally to a medical device for implantation in a hip joint, and a method of providing said medical device. BACKGROUND Hip joint Osteoarthritis is a syndrome in which low-grade inflammation results in pain in the hip joints, caused by abnormal wearing of the Cartilage that acts as a cushion inside if the hip joint. This abnormal wearing of the cartilage also results in a decrease of the joints lubricating fluid called Synovial fluid. Hip joint Osteoarthritis is estimated to affect 80% of all people over 65 years of age, in more or less serious forms. The present treatment for hip osteaarthritis comprises NSAID drugs, local injections of Hyaluronic acid or Glucocorticoid to help lubricating the hip joint, and replacing parts of the hip joint with a prosthesis through hip joint surgery. The replacing of parts of the hip joint is one of the most common surgeries to date performed at hundreds of thousands of patients in the world every year. The most common method comprises placing a metal prosthesis in Femur and a plastic bowl in Acetabulum. This operation is usually done through a lateral incision in the hip and upper thigh and through, Fascia Lata and the lateral muscles of the thigh. To get access to the hip joint, the supporting hip joint capsule attached to Femur and Ilium of Pelvis needs to be penetrated, making it difficult to get a fully functional joint after the surgery. Femur is then cut at the neck with a bone saw and the prosthesis is placed in femur either with bone cement or without. Acetabulum is slightly enlarged using an Acetabular reamer, and the plastic bowl is positioned using screws or bone cement. The surgery typically requires one week of hospitalization due to the increased risk of infection. The recovery process is on average about 6 weeks, but even after this period the patient should not perform any physical activates that places large strain on the joint.

The artificial acetabulum surface, comprises at least one first beyond part adapted to cover the bone of the caput femur or said artificial caput femur surface, on at least a part of said caput femur or said artificial caput femur surface, beyond the maximum inner diameter of said artificial acetabulum surface, away from the concave bottom of said acetabulum bowl, when mounted on said caput femur or an artificial caput femur surface in its functional position in the joint. The at least one first beyond part have a closest perpendicular distance to said centre axis, which is smaller than the distance between the periphery of said maximum inner diameter of said artificial acetabulum surface and said centre axis. The method further comprises the step of mounting said artificial acetabulum surface, including the first beyond part thereof, on the caput femur or said artificial caput femur surface in said functional position. This creates a more stable position of said artificial acetabulum surface. Preferable holding said artificial acetabulum surface in place until a certain predetermined pressure will dislocate it. Said predetermined pressure defined to both avoiding any broken bone or lose artificial hip joint surface and also avoiding unnecessary dislocations in between the joint surfaces. CAPUT FEMUR SURFACE The surgical or laparoscopic/arthroscopic method could further comprise the step of placing an artificial caput femur surface onto caput femur on the opposite side of collum femur and, when mounted in the joint, in said acetabulum bowl or an artificial replacement therefore. Said collum femur having an axial distribution leading to said caput femur having a substantially ball shaped configuration with a maximum diameter substantially perpendicular to the centre axis of the prolongation of said axial distribution of said collum femur, said caput femur or said artificial caput femur surface being normally placed in an acetabulum bowl or an artificial replacement therefore creating said hip joint. The artificial caput femur surface, comprises at least one first beyond part of said artificial caput femur surface adapted to cover and/or go into the bone of the caput femur on at least a part of said caput femur beyond the maximum diameter of said caput femur, away from said acetabulum bowl towards said collum femur, when mounted on said caput femur in its functional position in the joint. The at least one first beyond part have a closest perpendicular distance to said centre axis, which is smaller than the distance between the periphery of said maximum diameter of said caput femur and said centre axis. The method further comprises the step of mounting said artificial caput femur surface, including the first beyond part thereof, on the caput femur in said functional position. This creates a more stable position of said artificial caput femur surface. According to one embodiment, an artificial caput femur surface is adapted to be in connection with said acetabulum surface. It is conceivable that the diameter of the hole is larger than the largest diameter of the caput femur thus allowing the caput femur to pass through the hole. However it is also conceivable that said hole is smaller than the largest diameter of the caput femur thus hindering the caput femur from passing through the hole. The artificial caput femur surface could comprises at least two caput femur surface parts adapted to be connected to each other after insertion in a hip joint to form an artificial caput femur surface. According to one embodiment the at least two artificial caput femur surface parts are inserted through a hole in the pelvic bone from the opposite side from acetabulum, said hole having a diameter less than the largest diameter of said artificial caput femur surface. The mechanical connection that connects the parts of the artificial caput femur surface could be created using: at least one screw, at least one pin, at least one portion of at least one of the parts adapted to be introduced into the other part, the parts being adapted to be sliding into the other part, form fitting, welding, adhesive, pin, wire, a ball mounted into a bowl being portions of said parts, a male portion of one part mounted into a female portion of the other part, a key introduced into a lock being portions of said parts, band, or other mechanical connecting members. The surgical or laparoscopic/arthroscopic method could comprise the steps of: mounting said at least two artificial caput femur surface parts on caput femur to form an assembled medical device. The assembled medical device could be hollow. The method further comprises the steps of fixating said assembled medical device to the caput femur and surrounding, at least partly, the caput femur beyond said maximum diameter of said caput femur towards collum femur, the shape of said assembled medical device mechanically stabilizing the device when mounted on said caput femur. According to another embodiment the artificial caput femur surface could be adapted to have a varying largest diameter for insertion through a hole in the pelvic bone from the opposite side from acetabulum of said human patient. Since the largest diameter of the artificial caput femur surface is adapted to vary between being both smaller and larger than the hole in the pelvic bone, the hole could have a diameter smaller than the largest diameter of the artificial caput femur surface. The surgical or laparoscopic/arthroscopic method could comprise the step of inserting the artificial caput femur surface adapted to have a varying largest diameter through the hole in the pelvic bone. In this embodiment it is conceivable that the artificial caput femur surface is adapted to be flexible in its construction, thus enabling the insertion of said artificial caput femur surface through a hole in the pelvic bone that is smaller than said largest diameter of the artificial caput femur surface. The flexible part of the artificial caput femur surface could further be adapted to expand after insertion through the hole making the largest diameter of the artificial caput femur surface larger than the diameter of the hole in the pelvic bone, thus hindering the artificial caput femur surface from passing through the hole.

The hole has a diameter less than the largest diameter of said artificial caput femur surface of said human patient. The method further comprises the step of varying said largest diameter of said artificial caput femur surface between being both smaller and larger than the hole in the pelvic bone. The method steps could be performed by inserting said artificial caput femur surface through said hole in the pelvic bone and expanding said flexible construction of said artificial caput femur surface after said insertion through said hole making said artificial caput femur surface larger than said caput femur, thus not allowing passage through said hole in the pelvic bone.

The artificial caput femur surface further comprises at least one slit allowing the mounting of said artificial caput femur surface on the caput femur, which requires an opening area larger than the largest cross-sectional area of caput femur, and decreasing the size of said opening area to become smaller than said greatest internal cross-sectional area of said hollow medical device after said mounting on the caput femur. According to one embodiment the artificial caput femur surface is frustum spherical. According to one embodiment the surgical or laparoscopic/arthroscopic method comprises the steps of inserting said at least two artificial caput femur surface parts into said hip joint of said human patient and mounting said at least two artificial caput femur surface parts on said hip joint of said human patient to form said artificial caput femur surface, wherein said artificial caput femur surface is mechanically fixated to said caput femur by means of said mounting on the caput femur so that said artificial caput femur surface cannot be removed without dismounting said at least two artificial caput femur surface parts.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Biocompatible material is to be understood as being a material with low level of immune response. Biocompatible materials are sometimes also referred to as biomaterials. Analogous is biocompatible metals a metal with low immune response such as titanium or tantalum. The biocompatible metal could also be a biocompatible alloy comprising at least one biocompatible metal. Form fitting is to be understood as an element having a part or section which is adapted to enable a mechanical connection of said element to at least one other element using said part or section. Form fitted structure is a structure of an element which enables form fitting. Elasticity is to be understood as a materials ability to deform in an elastic way. Elastic deformation is when a material deforms under stress (e.g. external forces), but returns to its original shape when the stress is removed. A more elastic material is to be understood as a material having a lower modulus of elasticity. The elastic modulus of an object is defined as the slope of its stress-strain curve in the elastic deformation region. The elastic modulus is calculated as stress / strain, where stress is the force causing the deformation, divided by the area to which the force is applied; and strain is the ratio of the change caused by the stress. Stiffness is to be understood as the resistance of an elastic body to deformation by an applied force. The contacting surfaces in any of the embodiments herein could comprise a ceramic material such as a Zirconium dioxide ceramic material. In the following a detailed description of embodiments will be given. In the drawing figures, like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding elements throughout the several figures. It will be appreciated that these figures are for illustration only and are not in any way restricting the scope. Thus, any references to direction, such as "up" or "down", are only referring to the directions shown in the figures. Also, any dimensions etc. shown in the figures are for illustration purposes. Fig. 1 shows the hip joint of a human patient in section. The hip joint comprises a caput femur 5 placed at the very top of collum femur 6 which is the top part of the femoral bone 7. The caput femur is in connection with the acetabulum 8 which is a bowl shaped part of the pelvic bone 9. Both the caput femur surface 10 and the acetabulum surface 11 is covered with articular cartilage 13 which acts as a cushion in the hip joint. In patients with hip joint osteoarthritis, this articular cartilage 13 is abnormally worn down due to a low grade inflammation. The hip joint is surrounded by the hip joint capsule 12 which provides support for the joint and hinders luxation. After conventional hip joint surgery, penetrating the hip joint capsule 12, the capsule 12 is dramatically weakened due to the limited healing possibilities of its ligament tissue. By performing hip joint surgery without damaging the hip joint capsule 12 the patient can fully recover and place equal amount of strain on an artificial joint as is possible on a natural one. Functional hip movements are to be understood as movements of the hip that at least partly correspond to the natural movements of the hip. On some occasions the natural movements of the hip joint might be somewhat limited or altered after hip joint surgery, which makes the functional hip movements of a hip joint with artificial surfaces somewhat different than the functional hip movements of a natural hip joint. The functional position or normal functional position, of an implantable medical device or prosthesis is the position in which the hip joint can perform functional hip movements. The final position is to be understood as a functional position in which the medical device needs no further position change. Functional opening is to be understood as an opening serving a purpose as opening in particular for receiving the caput femur and part of the femoral bone. The functional opening is depicted in all medical devices herein placed on the caput femur, since the caput femur is inserted through the functional opening. Fig. 2 shows a lateral view of a conventional hip joint surgery where an incision 112 is made in the tight 113 enabling the surgeon to reach the femoral bone 7 on which the caput femur 5 is located. Fig. 3 shows the placing of an artificial caput femur surface 45 on the caput femur 5 in conventional surgery when the femoral bone has been removed from its position in the hip joint. Fig. 4 shows the placing of an artificial caput femur surface 45 on the caput femur in conventional surgery. The artificial caput femur according to this embodiment comprises slits 49 and arms 50 making the structure of the artificial caput femur surface flexible for clasping the caput femur 5 and going beyond the maximum diameter of the caput femur 5. Furthermore the artificial caput femur surface 45 can be inserted into a hip joint through a hole smaller than the full functional size of the artificial caput femur surface 45, enabling a less invasive surgical procedure. Fig. 5 shows the placing of an artificial caput femur surface 45 on the caput femur in conventional surgery. The artificial caput femur according to this embodiment comprises slits larger slits 49 and smaller arms making the structure of the artificial caput femur surface flexible for clasping the caput femur 5 and going beyond the maximum diameter of the caput femur 5. Furthermore the artificial caput femur surface 45 can be inserted into a hip joint through a hole smaller than the full functional size of the artificial caput femur surface 45, enabling a less invasive surgical procedure. Fig. 6 shows the placing of an artificial caput femur surface 45 on the caput femur in conventional surgery.

The incision 1 passes through the abdominal wall, including peritoneum in to the abdomen of the human patent. In a second preferred embodiment the incision 2 is conducted through the abdominal wall and into the pelvic area, below the peritoneum abdominal sac. According to a third embodiment the incision 3 is performed just between Illium of the pelvis bone and the surrounding tissue, an incision 3 which could enable the pelvic bone 9 to be dissected with very little penetration of fascia and muscular tissue. According to a fourth embodiment the incision 4 is made in the inguinal region. In all of the four embodiments the tissue surrounding the pelvic bone 9 in the area opposite to acetabulum 8 is removed or penetrated or divided or moved away which enables the surgeon to reach the pelvic bone 9. It is obvious that the methods described may both be combined or altered reaching the same goal to dissect the pelvic bone 9 on the opposite side of the acetabulum 8. Fig. 38 shows a frontal view of the body of a human patient. A laparoscopic/arthroscopic method of operating the hip joint, from the opposite side from acetabulum 8 is according to a first embodiment performed starting with making small incisions 14 in the abdominal wall of the human patient. The small incisions enable the surgeon to insert laparoscopic/arthroscopic trocars into the abdomen of the human patient. According to the first embodiment the incisions 14 passes through the abdominal wall, and peritoneum in to the abdomen of the human patent. According to a second preferred embodiment the small incisions 15 is conducted through the rectus abdominis or on the side thereof and in to the pelvic area, below peritoneum. According to a third embodiment the small incisions 16 is performed just between Illium of pelvis and the surrounding tissue, an incision 16 which could enable the pelvic bone to be dissected with very little penetration of fascia and muscular tissue. According to a fourth embodiment the incision 17 is made in the inguinal region. In all of the four embodiments the tissue surrounding the pelvic bone 9 in the area opposite to acetabulum 8 is removed or penetrated or divided or moved away which enables the surgeon to reach the pelvic bone 9. Fig. 39a shows a frontal view of the body of a human patient, illustrating the laparoscopic/arthroscopic method of operating the hip joint from the opposite side from acetabulum 8. The hip joint comprises the acetabulum 8 and the caput femur 5. The small incisions 14 in the abdominal wall of the human patient allows the insertion of laparoscopic/arthroscopic trocars 33a,b,c into the body of the patients. Whereafter one or more camera 34, a surgical instrument adapted to create a hole in the pelvic bone 35, or instruments 36 for dissecting, introducing, placing, connecting, attaching, creating or filling prosthesis or prosthetic parts, can be inserted into said body through said laparoscopic/arthroscopic trocars 33a,b,c. Fig. 39b shows a lateral cross-sectional view of the body of a human patient, with the hip joint shown in section in further detail. The hip joint comprises a caput femur 5 placed at the very top of collum femur 6 which is the top part of the femoral bone 7. The caput femur 5 is in connection with the acetabulum 8 which is a bowl shaped part of the pelvic bone 9. Laparoscopic/arthroscopic trocars 33a,b,c is being used to reach the hip joint 39 with one or more camera 34, a surgical instrument adapted to create a hole in the pelvic bone 35, or instruments 36 for dissecting, introducing, placing, connecting, attaching, creating or filling prosthesis or prosthetic parts. After dissecting the pelvic bone 9 a hole 18 is created in the bone 9, shown in fig. 19. The hole 18 passes through the pelvic bone 9 from the opposite side from acetabulum 8 and into the hip joint 19. Fig. 40 shows the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 according to a first embodiment, the hole 18 is large which allows prosthesis to pass through said hole 18 in their full functional size. According to a second embodiment the hole 20 created in the surgical or laparoscopic/arthroscopic method is much smaller as shown in fig. 41 allowing the surgical instrument creating the hole to be smaller, and thus the incision and dissection performed in the human body. Fig. 41 shows a surgical instrument for creating a hole 18, 20 in the pelvic bone 9a according to a first embodiment. The surgical instrument comprises a driving member 21a, b. The driving member 21a,b could be a shaft, a rod, a belt, a chain or any other element suitable for transferring force or torque. The surgical instrument also comprises a bone contacting organ 22 which is adapted to create the hole 18, 20 in the pelvic bone 9. The bone contacting organ 22 could have a sawing, drilling or milling effect using sharp objects; it is furthermore conceivable that said bone contacting organ 22 creates a hole using water, abrasive fluids, laser or radiation. The surgical instrument also comprises an operating device 23a adapted to operate the driving member 21a,b. The operating device could comprise an electrical, mechanical, pneumatic or magnetic motor and it could be adapted to create a rotating, oscillating, vibrating or repetitive movement. The operation device may include a source of ultrasound, radiation, laser or water. Fig. 42 shows a surgical instrument that further comprises a parallel displaced part or section 26. The parallel displaced part or section 26 improves the reach of the medical device and enables the creation of a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 from the opposite side from acetabulum 8. According to one embodiment shown in fig. 42 the parallel displaced part or section 26 has a telescopic function by means of the parallel displaced part or section 26 being divided in to a first and second part 27a, b, wherein the second part 27b can slide in and out of the first part 27a. Fig. 43 shows one embodiment in which the operating device 23b is be placed in direct connection with the bone contacting organ 22, in which case the operating device 23b also serves as driving member. In this construction a handle portion 24 could be attached to the surgical instrument, facilitating the surgeons handling of said surgical instrument. To improve the reach of the surgical instrument the handle portion 24 could be attached perpendicular to the hole-creating direction 25 of the surgical instrument, it is furthermore conceivable that the handle portion 24 is bent by means of a parallel displaced part or section, a fixed angle, an adjustable angle or a flexible part or section. Fig. 44 shows the surgical instrument according to a second embodiment wherein said surgical instrument comprises a driving member 28a,b,c with two angle adjusting members 29a,b. The angle adjusting members 29a,b could be adjustable for varying the angle of said driving member 28a,b,c or fixed in an angle suitable for creating a hole in the pelvic bone 9 from the opposite side from acetabulum 8. In another embodiment (not shown) the part of the driving member 28c in connection with the bone contacting organ 22 could be very short enabling the surgical instrument to operate very close to the pelvic bone 9 when creating a hole 18 in said pelvic bone 9. Fig. 45 shows the surgical instrument according to a third embodiment wherein the driving member 30 is flexible, enabling said driving member 30 to be very precisely adjusted to create a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 of the patient. The stiffness of said driving member 30 could range from completely flexible to completely stiff to fit the surroundings of the particular operation. Fig. 46 shows the bone contacting organ according to a first embodiment wherein the bone contacting organ 22a is adapted to crate a bone plug 31. The bone plug 31 could be adapted to be replaced into said hole 18 after the surgical or laparoscopic/arthroscopic steps performed in the hip joint has been concluded. Fig. 47 shows the bone contacting organ according to a second embodiment wherein the bone contacting organ 22b is adapted to create small pieces of bone 32 when creating said hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. The small pieces of bone could be transported from the area and out of the body using vacuum power or a hydraulic transport system. Fig. 48a shows the hip joint in section with the caput femur 5 placed at the very top of collum femur 6, which is the top part of the femoral bone 7. The caput femur is in connection with the acetabulum 8, which is a bowl shaped part of the pelvic bone 9. According to a first embodiment the hole 18 created in the pelvic bone 9 from the opposite side from acetabulum 8, is larger than said artificial caput femur surface 45, enabling the insertion of said artificial caput femur surface 45 in its full functional size. Said insertion of said artificial caput femur surface 45 could be performed as a step of the surgical method, as well as a step of the laparoscopic/arthroscopic method. After the insertion, the artificial caput femur surface 45 is attached to the caput femur 5, the attaching is performed by means of a mechanical attachment 44 comprising a shaft or screw penetrating the cortex. It is however also conceivable that the mechanical attachment 44 is assisted or replaced by bone cement or adhesive placed between caput femur 5 and the artificial caput femur surface 45, or in connection with said shaft or screw 44. Alternative ways of attaching the artificial caput femur surface 45 includes: at least one screw, at least one pin, at least one portion of at least one of the parts adapted to be introduced into the other part, the parts being adapted to be sliding into the other part, form fitting, welding, adhesive, pin, wire, a ball mounted into a bowl being portions of said parts, a male portion of one part mounted into a female portion of the other part, a key introduced into a lock being portions of said parts, band, or other mechanical connecting members. Fig. 48b shows the hip joint in section with the artificial caput femur surface 45 attached to the caput femur 5. The surgical and laparoscopic/arthroscopic methods described could further comprise the step of reaming the acetabulum 8 or the caput femur 5. According to a first embodiment the reaming of the acetabulum 8 or the caput femur is performed using an expandable reamer shown in figs. 49-51. The expandable reamer comprises at least one reaming blade 40 which comprises a reaming surface 41a,b. Said expandable reamer could be adapted to ream the acetabulum 8, the caput femur 5 or both. In the embodiment where said expandable reamer is adapted to ream the acetabulum 8 said reaming surface 41a is located on the exterior part of the at least one reaming blade 40, whereas in the embodiment when said expandable reamer is adapted to ream the caput femur 5, said reaming surface 41b is located on the interior part of the at least one reaming blade 40. According to a second embodiment said expandable reamer is adapted to ream both the acetabulum and the caput femur, in which case the reamer has reaming surfaces 41a,b both on the exterior and the interior part of the at least one reaming blade 40. Fig. 50 shows the expandable reamer, according to any of the embodiments, wherein the reaming blades 40 can be folded towards a center of the semi-sphere that the expandable reamer produces in its expanded state, shown in fig. 49. The folding of the reaming blades 40 enables the expandable reamer to be introduced into a hip joint through a hole smaller than the area possible to ream using said expandable reamer. Fig. 51 shows the interior said of the expandable reamer with the reaming blades 40. In the embodiment when the expandable reamer is adapted to ream the caput femur, said interior side of the at least one reaming blade 40 comprises a reaming surface 41b. Fig. 52 shows the expandable reamer according to any of the embodiments when reaming said acetabulum 8 and/or said caput femur 5. The reamer can be adapted to be operated manually or by means of a rotating, vibrating or oscillating operating device. According the one embodiment the bone contacting organ 22 of the surgical instrument for creating a hole in the pelvic bone can be replace with the expandable reamer shown in figs. 49-51, in which case the expandable reamer can be powered using the operating device 23a,b used in said surgical instrument. After the preparation of the hip joint surfaces the method step of inserting or creating new surfaces is performed. Fig. 53a shows how an expandable artificial caput femur surface 45 is being inserted through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9, using a tool for insertion of a medical device 1240. Fig. 53b shows how an expandable artificial caput femur surface 45 goes through the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 and travels over caput femur 5, by means of arms 50 of the artificial caput femur surface making the artificial caput femur surface flexible. Fig. 53c shows an expandable artificial caput femur surface 45 is after it has been placed on said caput femur 5. In this embodiment the artificial caput femur surface arms 50 clasps the caput femur 5. The medical device according to any of the embodiments could have the size of the largest diameter, largest radius or a largest cross-sectional distance being variable such that the medical device can be introduced through a hole 18 having a cross sectional area smaller than 530 mm2 or smaller than 380 mm2 or smaller than 250 mm2 or smaller than 180 mm2 or smaller than 110 mm2. Fig. 54a shows the hip joint in section according to a second embodiment in which the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 is smaller than the artificial caput femur surface 45 in its full functional size. According to this embodiment the artificial caput femur surface 45 is introduced into said hip joint through the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 form the opposite side from acetabulum 8. The artificial caput femur surface parts 46 are connected to each other after insertion into said hip joint to form the artificial caput femur surface 45. Fig. 54b shows the hip joint in section when the artificial caput femur surface parts 46 are connected to each other using form fitting 47, however it is conceivable that the form fitting is assisted or replaced with adhesive or bone cement. After the artificial caput femur surface parts 46 have been introduced and connected in the hip joint, they are mechanically fixated to the caput femur 5, the mechanical fixation could be done by means of: at least one screw, at least one pin, at least one portion of at least one of the parts adapted to be introduced into the other part, the parts being adapted to be sliding into the other part, form fitting, welding, adhesive, pin, wire, a ball mounted into a bowl being portions of said parts, a male portion of one part mounted into a female portion of the other part, a key introduced into a lock being portions of said parts, band, or other mechanical connecting members. Fig. 54c shows the artificial caput femur surface parts 46 with the parts supplying the form fitting 47 for connecting the parts to each other. Fig. 54d shows the hip joint in section wherein a second hole 18b in the pelvic bone 9 enables the surgeon to place a camera 34 into the hip joint, preferably used in the laparoscopic/arthroscopic method. Fig. 55a shows the femoral bone 7 where multiple positioning shafts 900a,b,c are placed in the caput femur 5. The positioning shafts 900a,b,c are adapted to guide, position and center artificial hip joint surface parts 913a,b on to the caput femur 5, or guide, position and center artificial hip joint surface parts 913a,b to be placed in the acetabulum. The artificial hip joint surface parts 913a,b each have a positioning hole 910a,b which are adapted to encircle the positioning shafts 900a,b,c placed in the caput femur 5. The artificial hip joint surface parts 913a,b are adapted to be connected to each other after insertion the hip joint using mechanical connecting members 914a,b, wherein the mechanical connecting members comprises a first part 914a placed in a first artificial hip joint surface part 913b and adapted to fit in a corresponding second part 914b, placed in a second artificial hip joint surface part 913a. The multiple positioning shafts 900a,b thereby assists in the connection of multiple artificial hip joint surface parts 913a,b to each other. However the mechanical connecting members 914a,b could be assisted or replaced by an adhesive. Fig. 55b shows the positioning of the artificial hip joint surface parts 913a,b from above with the positioning holes 910a,b of the artificial hip joint surface parts 913a,b encircling the positioning shafts 900a,b,c and thereby the positioning shafts 900a,b,c guiding, positioning and centering the artificial hip joint surface parts 913a,b in the hip joint. Fig. 56 shows a lateral view of a human patient where a surgical instrument 35 adapted to create a hole in the pelvic bone from the abdominal side of the pelvic bone 9 is inserted through an incision in the abdominal wall. The surgical instrument could comprise a flexible part or section 300, enabling the surgical instrument to be very precisely adjusted to reach the pelvic bone or the hip joint from the abdominal side of the pelvic bone. The stiffness of said flexible part or section 300 could range from completely flexible to completely stiff to fit the surroundings of the particular operation. The surgical instrument 35 could be powered through an operating device which in turn could comprise an electrical, hydraulic, mechanical, pneumatic or magnetic engine and it could be adapted to create a rotating, oscillating, vibrating or repetitive movement. According to another embodiment (not shown) the surgical instrument 35 is powered from an operating device being placed outside of the human body, in the thigh region. The force created in the operating device is then transferred through a force transferring member placed which is placed in the collum femur and femoral bone. This allows the surgeon to supply force to an area of the hip joint and its surroundings through an incision in the thigh. Fig. 57 shows a hip joint in section wherein a surgical instrument 35 adapted to create a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 is adapted to create a bone plug 31. The bone plug 31 could be adapted to be replaced into said hole 18 after the surgical or laparoscopic steps performed in the hip joint has been concluded. Fig. 58 shows a hip joint in section wherein a surgical instrument 604 for removing the caput femur 5 is provided through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. The surgical instrument is adapted to create a hole in the caput femur 5, passing down a longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6. The surgical instrument further comprises a sawing member 605a,b adapted to separate the caput femur from the collum femur. In a first state 605a, the sawing member 605a is retracted within the surgical instrument 604. When the surgical instrument is positioned inside of the collum femur in a desired position the sawing member is folded to a second state 605b allowing the sawing member to create a section in the collum femur, separating the caput femur 5 from the collum femur 6. Fig. 59 shows the hip joint in section when the surgical instrument 604 and the sawing member 605b is positioned inside of the collum femur. After the caput femur 5 has been removed, a stabilizing part of the collum femur 6 is retained. The stabilizing part of collum femur 6 could be defined to be the proximal half of said collum femur 6, the proximal two third of said collum femur, the proximal three quarter of said collum femur, the proximal 90% of said collum femur or the whole collum femur. The proximal part of collum femur being the part of collum femur closest to the torso of the human body. Fig. 60 - 64 shows the medical device and the method of placing said medical device according to a one embodiment. Fig. 60 shows the removal of the caput femur 5 after the surgical instrument 604 has created a surface of a section 610 substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6. The separated caput femur 5 is then removed through the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. Fig. 61 shows the removal of a piece of bone 609 from the caput femur 5. The removal of the piece of bone 609 is preferably performed outside of the human body. Fig. 13 shows the removal of the top part of caput femur 5; however it is equally conceivable that the piece of bone is removed from any other side of the caput femur 5. Fig. 62 shows the medical device 600 according to one embodiment. The medical device comprises a fixating member 608 and an artificial caput femur surface 607. The artificial caput femur surface 607 is adapted to be in contact with the acetabulum surface 11 or an artificial replacement therefore. The fixating member 608 is adapted to at least partly be stabilized by the cortical bone 601 of a stabilizing part of the collum femur 6. The stabilizing could be performed from the inside, substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6, and from the acetabulum side, substantially in line with the longitudinal extension. The stabilizing could further be performed from the acetabulum side, substantially in line with the longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6, and from the outside, substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6, from the inside, substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6, and from the outside, substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6, or from the acetabulum side, substantially in line with the longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6, and from the outside, substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6. The medical device 600 could be adapted to at least partly be directly stabilized by the cortical bone 601 of said stabilizing part of said collum femur 6, or to be indirectly stabilized by the cortical bone 601 of said stabilizing part of said collum femur 6. In the embodiments (not shown) when the medical device 600 is indirectly stabilized by the cortical bone 601 of the collum femur 6 it is conceivable that a material is placed between said cortical bone 601 and the fixating member 608 of the medical device 600. The material could be: bone cement, an at least partly elastic material, glue, adhesive, antibiotic, biocompatible plastic material, biocompatible ceramics and/or a biocompatible metal such as titanium or tantalum. The hole 609 in the piece of bone 606 from the caput femur 5 is preferably the hole created by the surgical instrument 604 in the process of removing the caput femur, however it is conceivable that the hole 609 needs to be altered or adapted for fitting the fixating member 608which is adapted to be placed inside of the hole 609 in the piece of bone 606 removed from the caput femur 5. Fig. 63 shows a hip joint in section when the medical device 600, comprises an artificial caput femur surface 607, a fixating member 608 and a stabilizing member 606, being inserted through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. According to this embodiment the stabilizing member is a piece of bone 606 placed on the outside of the fixating member 608. The stabilizing member 606 could be fixated to the fixating member 608 using adhesive or any mechanical connection, such as screws, cord, band or pop-rivets. According to this embodiment the medical device is stabilized by the cortical bone 601 of the collum femur 6 on the inside thereof substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6, and from the acetabulum side, substantially in line with the longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6 through the stabilizing member being placed in contact with the surface of a section 610 on the collum femur 6. The stabilizing member and the fixating member could be fixated to the collum femur 6 by means of an adhesive or bone cement. Fig. 64 shows the hip joint in section when the medical device 600, according to the first embodiment, has been placed on the collum femur 6 and is stabilized from the inside thereof by the direct or indirect connection with the cortical bone 601 of the collum femur 6. Fig. 65 shows the caput femur 5 after the proximal part has been removed along the section created by the medical device for creating a hole. The removing of the proximal part of the caput femur 5 creates a surface of a section 102 in the cortical bone of the caput femur 5. A reamer 40 adapted to create a concave surface 103 in the caput femur 5 is applied to the force transferring member 21 through a connecting section 101. According to this embodiment the force transferring member 21 is the same as the force transferring member used for the medical device adapted to create a hole in the pelvic bone 9, however it is equally conceivable that the force transferring member 21 is specifically designed to enable the reaming of the caput femur 5. The reaming in the caput femur and part of the collum femur 6 is mainly performed in the cancellous bone, however that does not exclude the possibility the some of the reaming needs to be performed in the cortical bone of the caput femur 5 and/or the collum femur 6. Fig. 66 shows the step of applying an adhesive 106 to the concave surface created by the reamer 40. The adhesive 106 is applied by an injecting member 104 comprising an injecting nozzle 105. The adhesive 106 is preferably a biocompatible adhesive such as bone cement. The injecting member 104 is in this embodiment adapted for introduction through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9, through the injecting member 104 being bent. Fig. 67 shows the step of providing a medical device 109 comprising an artificial concave hip joint surface 110.

The medical device 109 comprises a fixation support 111 adapted to anchor said artificial concave hip joint surface 110, to at least one of the caput femur 5 and the collum femur 6. The medical device 109 is adapted to be introduced to the hip joint through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 using a inserting member 107. According to this embodiment the inserting member is bent and thereby adapted to operate through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. The inserting member 107 comprises a connecting member 108 which is adapted to connect to the medical device 109. According to one embodiment the medical device 109 comprises a self lubricating material such as PTFE, however it is also conceivable that said medical device comprises: titanium, stainless steel, Corian, PE, or other acrylic polymers, in which case the medical device could be adapted to be lubricated after insertion in said hip joint. Fig. 68 shows a medical device comprising an artificial convex hip joint surface 112. The artificial convex hip joint surface 112 is adapted to be fixated to the pelvic bone 9, and is adapted to be inserted through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. The medical device comprises a nut 120, comprising threads for securely fixating the medical device to the pelvic bone 9. The medical device further comprises a prosthetic part 118 adapted to occupy the hole 18 created in the pelvic bone 9 after the medical device has been implanted in the patient. The prosthetic part 118 comprises supporting members 119 adapted to be in contact with the pelvic bone 9 and assist in the carrying of the load placed on the medical device from the weight of the human patient in normal use. Normal use is defined as the same as a person would use a natural hip joint. Further the medical device comprises a locking element 116 comprising a surface 117 adapted to be in contact with the artificial convex hip joint surface 112. The locking element 116 further comprises fixating members 115 which are adapted to assist in the fixation of the locking member 116 to the caput femur 5 or collum femur 6, which in turns fixates the artificial convex hip joint surface 112. The artificial convex hip joint surface 112 is fixated to a attachment rod 113 comprising a thread 114 that corresponds to the thread of the nut 120 in connection with the prosthetic part 118. According to the embodiment shown in fig. 68 a part comprising the artificial convex hip joint surface 112, the attachment rod 113 and the thread 114 is formed by two parts wherein the first part 1241' comprises the first part of the artificial convex hip joint surface 112, the first part of the attachment rod 113 and the first part of the thread 114, and the second part 1241" comprises the second part of the artificial convex hip joint surface 112', the second part of the attachment rod 113 and the second part of the thread 114'. The first and second parts are adapted to the connected to each other to form a connected part for examples by means of the interconnecting functions as described with reference to figs. 23 - 30. Fig. 69 shows the hip joint in section when the artificial convex hip joint surface is fixated in the medical device 109 comprising a concave hip joint surface 110. The convex hip joint surface 112 is secured in place by the locking element 116 which is fixated to the caput femur using screws 121. The surface of the locking element 117 and the concave hip joint surface 117 is placed in connection with the convex hip joint surface and could be made of a friction reducing material such as PTFE or a self lubricating powder material. However it is also conceivable that the connecting surfaces are lubricated using an implantable lubrication system adapted to lubricate the medical device after said medical device has been implanted in the human patient. Fig. 70 shows the placing of a prosthetic part 118 adapted to occupy the hole 18 created in the pelvic bone 9. The prosthetic part 118 comprises supporting members 119 adapted to be in contact with the pelvic bone 9 and assist in the carrying of the load placed on the medical device from the weight of the human patient. According to the embodiment shown in fig. 12 the supporting members 119 are located on the abdominal side of the pelvic bone 9, however it is equally conceivable the supporting members 119 are located on the acetabulum side of the pelvic bone 9, in which case they are preferably displaceable for allowing insertion of the prosthetic part 118 through the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. Furthermore fig. 12 shows the fixation of a nut 120 to the attachment rod 113. According to the embodiment shown in fig. 12 the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 is adapted to be larger than the medical device allowing the medical device to be inserted in its full functional size. According to other embodiments the hole 18 is smaller in which case the medical device could comprise of several parts adapted to be connected after insertion in the hip joint, such as shown in fig. 68, or the medical device could be expandable for insertion through a hole smaller than the full functional size of the medical device. The expandable medical device could be enabled through the elements of the medical device comprising elastic material. Fig. 71 shows the hip joint in section when all the elements of the medical device has been fixated in the area of the hip joint or its surroundings. The prosthetic part 113 adapted to occupy the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 is here fixated with screws 121, however these screws 121 could be assisted or replaced by an adhesive which could be applied to the surface S between the prosthetic part and the pelvic bone 9. In the above embodiments the medical device 600 have been described in the context of a surgical procedure from the abdominal side of the pelvic bone, however it is also conceivable that the medical device is inserted through the a hole in the femoral bone or a hole in the hip joint capsule, and is adapted therefore. A conceptual view of the embodiment where the medical device 600 is inserted through the hip joint capsule as shown with reference to figs. 2 - 10, what is commonly described as conventional hip joint surgery. After the step of providing an artificial caput femur surface, the surgical and laparoscopic/arthroscopic methods could further comprise the step of providing an artificial acetabulum surface.

Fig. 74 shows an embodiment where an artificial acetabulum surface 65 is pre-mounted onto the artificial caput femur surface 45. The medical device comprising the artificial caput femur surface 45 further comprises prosthetic stem for fixation of the medical device in the femoral bone. According to the embodiment shown in fig. 74 the artificial acetabulum surface 65 has a flexible construction with multiple slits 66 enabling the artificial acetabulum surface 65 to pass beyond the maximum diameter of the artificial caput femur surface 45 and thereby clasping the artificial caput femur surface 45. The artificial acetabulum surface is secured by a band, cord or wire 1223 placed encircling the artificial acetabulum surface 65. Fig. 75 shows the medical device when the pre-mounted artificial acetabulum surface 65 has been provided and secured by the band, cord or wire 1223 encircling the artificial acetabulum surface 65 beyond the maximum diameter of the artificial caput femur surface 45. Fig. 76 shows the femoral bone, in the step in which the surface of the section 610 in the collum femur 6 is prepared. An adhesive 614 is applied to the surface of the section 610 of the collum femur 6 for fixating the medical device, comprising a pre-mounted artificial acetabulum surface 65 on the artificial caput femur surface, to the collum femur 6 using the fixating member 608 and the stabilizing member 612. Fig. 77 shows the femoral bone after the step of introducing and fixating the medical device to the collum femur 6 has been preformed. The stabilizing member 612 is adapted to stabilize the medical device 600 from the outside of the collum femur 6 substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6, and from the acetabulum side, substantially in line with the longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6 through the stabilizing member being placed in contact with the outside of the collum femur 6 and the surface of the section 610 in the collum femur 6. The stabilizing member 612 is fixated to the outside of the collum femur 6 and/or to the surface of the section 610 in the collum femur 6 by means of the adhesive 614. However the adhesive 614 could be replaced or assisted by bone cement or a mechanical fixation element. According to one embodiment the artificial acetabulum surface 65 is provided through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 from the opposite side from acetabulum 8. Fig. 78 shows an artificial acetabulum surface 65 in its full functional size as it is being inserted through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. Fig. 79 shows an artificial acetabulum surface 65 according to a second embodiment in which the artificial acetabulum surface 65 comprises at least one slit 66 enabling the artificial acetabulum surface 65 to vary in size for insertion through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 smaller than the full functional size of the artificial caput femur surface 45. The slits are placed between one or more artificial acetabulum surface arms 67 which are flexible by means of the material or by means of a joint affecting said artificial acetabulum surface arms 67. Fig. 80a,b,c shows an artificial acetabulum surface 65 according to a second embodiment in which the artificial acetabulum surface 65 comprises multiple artificial acetabulum surface parts 68. Said multiple artificial acetabulum surface parts 68 are adapted to be connected to an interconnecting artificial acetabulum surface part 69 after insertion into a hip joint. The interconnecting artificial caput femur surface part 69 comprises self locking connecting members 70a, shown in fig. 80b, that fits with corresponding self locking members 70b of the artificial acetabulum surface parts 68. The artificial acetabulum surface parts 68 create an artificial acetabulum surface 65 when connected to each other, shown in fig. 80c. The self locking members 70a,b can be assisted or replaced with at least one screw, at least one pin, at least one portion of at least one of the parts adapted to be introduced into the other part, the parts being adapted to be sliding into the other part, form fitting, welding, adhesive, pin, wire, a ball mounted into a bowl being portions of said parts, a male portion of one part mounted into a female portion of the other part, a key introduced into a lock being portions of said parts, band, or other mechanical connecting members. Fig. 81a,b,c shows an artificial acetabulum surface 65 according to a third embodiment in which the artificial acetabulum surface 65 comprises multiple ring-shaped artificial acetabulum surface parts 71. Said multiple ring-shaped artificial acetabulum surface parts 71 are adapted to be connected to each other to form an artificial acetabulum surface 65 after insertion in a hip joint. According to one embodiment said artificial acetabulum surface parts 71 are adapted to be connected to each other using mechanical connecting members 72a,b. Fig. 81c shows how an individual ring-shaped artificial acetabulum surface part 71 can be connected to itself using the mechanical connecting member 72a to form a continuous ring shape. Further 81c shows how an individual ring-shaped artificial acetabulum surface part 71 connects to other ring-shaped artificial acetabulum surface parts 71 using the mechanical connecting member 72b to form an artificial acetabulum surface 65. Fig. 82a,b,c,d shows an artificial acetabulum surface 65 according to a fourth embodiment in which the artificial acetabulum surface 65 comprises a first 73a and a second 73b section, shown in fig. 82b. The first and second sections are displaceable in relation to each other. According to a first embodiment said first section 73a can be rotated in relation to said second section 73b so that said second section 73b travels underneath said first section 73a to create a displaced artificial acetabulum surface 74, as shown in fig. 38c, which is possible to insert into a hip joint of a human patient through a hole being oval, or at least having an area smaller than the cross sectional area of the artificial acetabulum surface 65 when in its full functional size 65. According to this embodiment the two sections 73a,b are connected to each other when the artificial acetabulum surface is returned to its full functional size using a mechanical form fitting 75, as shown in fig. 82d. However it is also conceivable that said connection is assisted or replaced with at least one screw, at least one pin, at least one portion of at least one of the parts adapted to be introduced into the other part, the parts being adapted to be sliding into the other part, form fitting, welding, adhesive, pin, wire, a ball mounted into a bowl being portions of said parts, a male portion of one part mounted into a female portion of the other part, a key introduced into a lock being portions of said parts, band, or other mechanical connecting members. Fig. 83a shows an artificial acetabulum surface 65 according to a fifth embodiment in which the artificial acetabulum surface 65 comprises four slits 66. The artificial acetabulum surface 65 is flexible in its construction allowing the four artificial acetabulum arms 67 to be folded towards the center axis of the artificial acetabulum surface 65 thus allowing the artificial acetabulum surface to be inserted into a hip joint through a hole smaller than the full functional size of the artificial acetabulum surface 65. Fig. 83b shows the artificial acetabulum surface 65 according to the fifth embodiment in its folded state. The artificial acetabulum surfaces 65 of any of the embodiments could be adapted to pass beyond the maximum diameter of the caput femur 5 and thereby fixate the artificial acetabulum surface 65 to the caput femur, or an artificial replacement therefore, by clasping the caput femur 5. Fig. 84a shows a surgical instrument adapted to insert a prosthesis, prosthetic parts or parts needed to create or provide a hip joint surface, according to a first embodiment. The surgical instrument comprises a gripping portion 76 and a handling portion 77. According to the embodiments shown in fig. 84a,b,c the instrument further comprises a rotation element 78 that enables the gripping part 76 to rotate in relation to the handling part 77, however it is equally conceivable that the surgical instrument lacks this rotation element 78. Fig. 84b shows the surgical instrument adapted to insert a prosthesis, prosthetic parts or parts needed to create or provide a hip joint surface, according to a second embodiment. According to this embodiment the surgical instrument further comprises a parallel displaced section 79, which increases the reach of the instrument and facilitates the reaching of the hip joint through a hole in the pelvic bone from the opposite side from acetabulum. Fig. 84c shows the surgical instrument adapted to insert a prosthesis, prosthetic parts or parts needed to create or provide a hip joint surface, according to a third embodiment. According to this embodiment the surgical instrument further comprises two angle adjusting members 84a,b. The angle adjusting members could be adjustable for varying the angle of said gripping part 76 in relation to the handling portion 77, or fixed in an angle suitable for creating operating in a hip joint through a hole in the pelvic bone from the opposite side from acetabulum 8. Fig. 85 shows the hip joint in section after the artificial caput femur surface 45, and the artificial acetabulum surface 65 have been provided through a hole in the pelvic bone. Fig. 86 shows an artificial bowl shaped acetabulum cup 65 placed in the pelvic bone 9. The artificial bowl shaped acetabulum cup 65 comprises releasing members 801 adapted, in a first state, to hold the caput femur 5 which is a ball shaped piece attached to the collum femur 6 in position in the hip joint to the artificial bowl shaped acetabulum cup 65 placed in the pelvic bone 9. In a second state the releasing member 801 is adapted to release the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, from the artificial bowl shaped acetabulum cup 65 placed in the pelvic bone 9. The releasing member 801 is adapted to change from the first state to the second state when a pre-determined strain is placed on the releasing member 801. The strain is preferably caused by an abnormal movement of the hip joint, e.g. as the result of the patient falling. According to the embodiment shown in fig. 9 the releasing member 801 comprises an elastic portion comprising elastic material, in the embodiment shown being the entire releasing member 801. The releasing member is adapted to non-invasively be able to change from the first state to the second state and from the second state to the first state, when a pre-determined strain is placed on the releasing member 801. Fig. 87 shows the hip joint in section when the releasing member 801 is in its second state, wherein the releasing member 801 is adapted to release the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, from the artificial bowl shaped acetabulum cup 65 placed in the pelvic bone 9. The releasing member 801 has changed from the first state to the second state because of a pre-determined strain has been placed on the releasing members 801. Fig. 88 shows the medical device according to an embodiment where the artificial bowl shaped acetabulum surface 65 comprises releasing members 801 comprising holding members 802a,b adapted to slide against the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore. The holding members are adapted to, in a first state, hold the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, which is a ball shaped part attached to the collum femur 6 in position in the hip joint to the artificial bowl shaped acetabulum cup 65 placed in the pelvic bone 9. In a second state the releasing member 801 is adapted to release the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, from the artificial bowl shaped acetabulum cup 65 placed in the pelvic bone 9. The holding members 802a,b are spring loaded through a spring 803a,b being placed between a calibration member, being a calibration screw 804a,b, and the holding members 802a,b. The force exerted on the holding members 802a,b from the spring 803a,b is adapted to hold the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, in the artificial acetabulum 65 in normal, functional hip joint movements, but release the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, from the artificial acetabulum 65 when a pre-determined strain is placed on the releasing member preferably being caused by an abnormal movement of the hip joint, e.g. as the result of the patient falling. The calibration screws 804a,b enables the pre-determination of the strain which will cause the holding members 802a,b to change from being in a first state to being in a second state. Fig 89 shows the releasing members in their second state, when a pre-determined strain has been exceeded, preferably being caused by an abnormal movement of the hip joint, e.g. as the result of the patient falling. The holding members 802a,b are retracted into sleeves 806 of the artificial acetabulum surface 65, thereby compressing the springs 803a,b. The retraction of the holding members 802a,b causes the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, to be dislocated/luxated from its position in the artificial acetabulum surface 65, which, when large strain is placed on the hip joint and femoral bone 7, reduces the risk of the patient fracturing the femoral bone 7 or the pelvic bone 9. The holding members 802a,b are adapted to non-invasively be able to change from the first state to the second state and from the second state to the first state, when a pre-determined strain is placed on the holding members 802a,b. Fig. 90 shows the artificial acetabulum 65 in section with the holding members 802, placed in sleeves 806 evenly distributed along the cross-section of the artificial acetabulum 65, holding the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, in position in the artificial acetabulum 65. Fig. 91 shows an alternative embodiment of the principle shown in figs 88 - 90, wherein the holding members 802a,b, comprises ball shaped members 805a,b in contact with the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, ant being adapted to roll against the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, holding the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, in place in the artificial acetabulum 65 by the holding members 802a,b exerting force on the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, through the contact with the springs 803a,b supported by the calibration screws 804a,b. Fig. 92 shows the releasing members in their second state, when a pre-determined strain has been exceeded, preferably being caused by an abnormal movement of the hip joint, e.g. as the result of the patient falling. The holding members 802a,b, comprising the ball shaped members 805a,b, are retracted into sleeves 806 of the artificial acetabulum surface 65, thereby compressing the springs 803a,b. The retraction of the holding members 802a,b causes the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, to be dislocated/luxated from its position in the artificial acetabulum surface 65, which, when large strain is placed on the hip joint and femoral bone 7, reduces the risk of the patient fracturing the femoral bone 7 or the pelvic bone 9. The holding members 802a,b are adapted to non-invasively be able to change from the first state to the second state and from the second state to the first state, when a pre-determined strain is placed on the holding members 802a,b, which enables the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, to be replaced in the artificial acetabulum 65 without a surgical procedure. Fig 93 shows the medical device in an embodiment wherein the releasing members 801 comprises a rupture device 807, 808, 809 adapted to fail at a pre-determined strain. According to this embodiment the rupture device is a rupture pin 807, 808, 809 comprising a base part 809a,b fixated to the artificial acetabulum 65 and a rupture part 807a,b attached to the base part 809a,b through a weakened section 808a,b, in which section the rupture part 807a,b is detached from the base part 809a,b when a predetermined strain is placed on the rupture device in contact with the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore. Fig. 94 shows the medical device according to the embodiment of fig. 93 when the rupture device has failed due to a pre-determined strain on the rupture device being exceeded. According to one embodiment, (not shown) the rupture parts 807a,b are secured to the base part through a security wire keeping rupture parts 807a,b in proximity to the base part 809a,b even after the failure of the rupture device. Fig 95a shows the medical device according to an embodiment where the artificial acetabulum 65 comprises a circular sleeve 806, in which an elastic or rupture band 810 is provided. The elastic or rupture band 810 is adapted to at least partly encircle the ball shaped caput femur 5, or artificial replacement therefore. When a pre-determined strain is placed on the elastic or rupture band 810 the circular opening encircling the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, is expanded and the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, is released from the artificial acetabulum 65, to which it is held by means of the elastic band 610. In embodiments where the medical device comprises a rupture band 810 holding the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, in the artificial acetabulum 65, a weakened portion 811 of the band 810 fails and thus the circular opening encircling the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, is expanded and the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, is released from the artificial acetabulum 65. In the embodiments where the band 810 is an elastic band 810 it is conceivable that the band 810 comprises an elastic part or section, or that the entire band 810 is made of an elastic material. Fig. 95 b shows the medical device in section when the elastic or rupturing band 810, holding the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, is placed in a circular sleeve 806 in the artificial acetabulum 65. An opening or weakened portion 811 is provided perpendicular to the circumference of the band 810.Fig. 96a shows the medical device in a second state where the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, is released from the connection with the acetabulum, after a pre-determined stain has been placed on the elastic or rupture band 810. As shown in fig. 96b the gap or weakened part has been expanded, thereby allowing the caput femur, or an artificial replacement therefore, 5 to pass through the opening defined by the elastic or rupture band 810. The medical device could be adapted to non-invasively be able to change from the first state to the second state and from the second state to the first state, when a pre-determined strain is placed on the band 810, which enables the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, to be replaced in the artificial acetabulum 65 without a surgical procedure. Fig. 97 shows the medical device according to an embodiment where the releasing member 801 comprises an elastic wing of the artificial acetabulum 65, which is assisted by an elastic or rupture band 810 encircling the medical device by enclosing the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, in the artificial acetabulum 65 passing beyond the point of the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, having a largest. The elastic or rupture band 810 is held in place to the artificial acetabulum 65 by means of the band 810 being placed in a groove along the circumference of the artificial acetabulum 65. However, said groove could be assisted or replaced by an adhesive or a mechanical fixation element. Fig. 98 shows the medical device when in its second state, in which the releasing member 801 releases the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, from the artificial acetabulum 65. In embodiments when the band 810 is an elastic band 810 it is expanded, thereby enlarging the hole through which the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, can pass. In embodiment where the band 810 is a rupture band, the band 810 has failed and thereby the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, is held in place solely by the releasing member 801 which is adapted to release the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, at a pre-defined strain. The medical device could be adapted to non-invasively be able to change from the first state to the second state and from the second state to the first state, when a pre-determined strain is placed on the band 810 and/or the releasing member 801, which enables the caput femur 5, or an artificial replacement therefore, to be replaced in the artificial acetabulum 65 without a surgical procedure. Fig. 99 shows a prosthetic part 818 according to an embodiment where the prosthetic part 818 is fixated to the femoral bone 7 and comprises a caput femur 812 comprising a cavity 816 adapted to enable the hip joint to perform functional hip joint movements while in a first state held to the artificial acetabulum using an elastic bend 817 fixated to a fixation portion 814 of the artificial caput femur 812, and a fixating portion 815 of the artificial acetabulum 65, and a releasing member 801 according to the embodiment shown in figs. 9 and 10. The combination of the releasing member 801 and the elastic band 817 is adapted to, in a first state hold the prosthetic part 818 to the artificial acetabulum 65, and in a second state release the prosthetic part 818 from the artificial acetabulum 65. According to another embodiment (not shown) the prosthetic part is held to the artificial acetabulum 65 solely using the elastic band 817, of course also supported by the remainder of the hip joint capsule and the affected muscles. Fig. 100 shows the embodiment of the medical device according to fig. 99, in a second state in which the elastic band 817 is stretched such that the prosthetic part 818 is released from the artificial acetabulum artificial acetabulum 65. The elastic band 817 could be fixated to a fixation portion 814 of the artificial caput femur 812, and/or a fixating portion 815 of the artificial acetabulum 65 using: at least one screw, at least one pin, form fitting, welding, adhesive, pin, wire, a ball mounted into a bowl, a male portion of one part mounted into a female portion of the other part, a key introduced into a lock being portions of said parts, band, or other mechanical connecting members. The failing of the rupture band 813 is preferably caused by an abnormal movement of the hip joint, e.g. as the result of the patient falling. Preferably the elastic band 817 comprises an elastic part or section, which could be the entire elastic band 818, made from an elastic material, such as an elastic polymer material such as: a copolymer material such as polystyrene, poly(ethylene-butylene) or polystyrene. It is also conceivable that the material is a polyurethane elastomeric material, polyamide elastomeric materials and polyester elastomeric materials elastic copolymers of ethylene and at least one vinyl monomer such as, for example, vinyl acetates, unsaturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids, and esters of such monocarboxylic acids. The elastic band 813 could comprise a barrier coating, which cannot be penetrated by body cells. Preferably, the barrier coating comprises a Parylene coating, or a biocompatible metal coating, such as gold, silver or titanium. According to other embodiments the elastic band comprises a spring type member, a combination of metal and plastic materials, a combination of metal and carbon based material or a combination of carbon and plastic based material. Fig. 101 shows the hip joint in section in an embodiment where the medical device comprises a prosthetic part 819 adapted to be fixated to the femoral bone 7. The prosthetic part comprises an artificial caput femur which is adapted to comprise elastic elements 820 which act as a releasing member holding the artificial caput femur inside of the artificial acetabulum 65 fixated to the pelvic bone. The elastic elements 820 of the artificial caput femur, is preferably made of an elastic material, which for example could be an elastomeric polymer material or an elastic metal material. It is conceivable that the elastic material comprises an outer layer in connection with the artificial acetabulum 65 which is adapted to resist the wear from the contact with the artificial acetabulum surface, which could be a ceramic material. The elastic element is adapted to compress when a pre-determined strain is placed on the hip joint and thereby on the elastic elements 820. When the elastic elements 820 are compressed the artificial caput femur is released from the artificial acetabulum 65. Fig. 102 shows the medical device according to the embodiment shown in fig. 101, in a second state, in which the elastic element 820 has been compressed, following a pre-determined strain being placed on the medical device. The medical device is thereby placed in a second state, in which the artificial caput femur is released from the artificial acetabulum 65, wherein it has been held. Fig. 103 shows an embodiment of the medical device in which the elastic elements 820 are further assisted by a spring 821 in connection with two elastic elements 820, the spring 821 is compressed alongside the elastic members 820, when a pre-determined strain is placed on the prosthetic part 819 comprising the artificial caput femur. Fig. 104 shows an artificial expandable acetabulum surface 65 being fixated in the pelvic bone 9. The artificial acetabulum surface 65 is adapted to travel beyond the maximum diameter of the caput femur 5 and thereby clasping the caput femur 5. An artificial caput femur surface 45 has been provided on the caput femur 5, the artificial caput femur passing beyond the maximum diameter of the caput femur 5 and thereby clasping the caput femur 5. The construction with surfaces passing beyond the maximum diameter of the caput femur 5 enables a stable fixation of the hip joint surfaces and reduces the risk of luxation. A different approach to the step of providing an artificial hip joint surface will now be described. This approach comprises the steps of casting an artificial hip joint surface inside of the hip joint. These steps can be performed by means of a mould; such mould may also be using human parts such as caput femur and/or acetabulum or any of the artificial hip joint surfaces. Fig. 105 shows the step of placing a mould 81 inside of the hip joint of a human patient through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. The step of placing said mould 81 can be performed in the surgical, or in the laparoscopic/arthroscopic method. Fig. 106a,b,c,d shows an alternative approach to placing said mould 81 in the hip joint of a human patient. Said alternative approach comprises the steps of creating a hole 82 in the femoral bone 7 following a length axis of the collum femur 6, said hole starting from the lateral side of the thigh, penetrating the cortex of the femoral bone 7 and eventually reaching the cortex of the caput femur 5 from the inside thereof, penetrating said cortex and entering into the hip joint. After the creation of the hole 82 in the femoral bone 7 the mould 81 is inserted into the hip joint through the hole 82 using a surgical instrument 83 adapted therefore, shown in fig. 106b. Fig 106c shows the mould 82 when being inserted into the hip joint using the surgical instrument 83 adapted therefore. Fig. 106d shows the mould 82 after insertion into the hip joint, the surgical instrument used to place said mould 82 in the hip joint is retracted after the insertion is completed. It is also conceivable that the hip joint surface is provided by casting the hip joint surface inside of the hip joint without the use of a mould. Fig. 107 shows the hip joint in section wherein a first sealing member 84 is inserted through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 using an instrument adapted therefore 85. The step of placing said first sealing member 84 can be performed in the surgical, or in the laparoscopic/arthroscopic method. Fig. 108 shows the hip joint in section wherein a second sealing member 86 is inserted through the surgical or laparoscopic/arthroscopic method. The first 84 and second 86 sealing members creates a sealed space 87 between the acetabulum 8 and the caput femur 5 or one or two artificial replacements therefore, adapted to be used as a mould for providing an artificial acetabulum 65 and/or a caput femur surface 45. Fig. 109a,b,c shows an alternative approach to placing said first sealing member 84 in the hip joint of a human patient. Said alternative approach comprises the steps of creating a hole 82 in the femoral bone 7 following a length axis of the collum femur 6, as shown in fig. 46a, said hole starting from the lateral side of the thigh, penetrating the cortex of the femoral bone 7 and eventually reaching the cortex of the caput femur 5 from the inside thereof, penetrating said cortex and entering into the hip joint. After the creation of the hole 82 in the femoral bone 7 the first sealing member 84 is inserted into the hip joint through the hole 82 using a surgical instrument 88 adapted therefore, as shown in fig. 109c. Fig. 110a,b,c shows the surgical instrument adapted to insert a mould 81 and/or a first and second sealing member 84,86 into the hip joint of a human patient through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 or a hole 82 in the femoral bone 9. Fig 110b shows a section of the surgical instrument 83,85,88 comprising a tube like element for housing of the mould 81 and/or said first and second sealing members 84,86. A piston 89 used to transport said mould 81 and/or first and second sealing members 84,86 into the hip joint of a human patient is also shown. Fig 110c shows a the surgical instrument 83,85,88 adapted to insert a mould 81 and/or a first and second sealing member 84,86 into the hip joint of a human patient, the second embodiment further comprises a flexible or bent part 91 improving the reach of the surgical instrument. After the steps of providing a mould 81 or a sealed space 87, fluid is injected into said mould 81 or into said sealed space 87 through the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 or the hole 82 in the femoral bone 7. Fig. 111 shows the hip joint in section wherein an injecting member 92 injects a fluid 93 into a sealed area 87 in the hip joint through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 from the opposite side from acetabulum 8. Said sealed area 87, is sealed by a first 84 and second 86 sealing member. The injecting member 92 comprises a piston 94 that pushes said fluid 93 into the sealed area 87. Fig. 112 shows the hip joint in section wherein an injecting member 92 injects a fluid 93 into a mould 81 in the hip joint through a hole 82 in the femoral bone 7. The injecting member 92 comprises a piston 94 that pushes said fluid 93 into the mould 81. Fig. 113 shows the hip joint in section wherein an injecting member 92 injects a fluid 93 into a sealed area 87 in the hip joint through a hole 82 in the femoral bone 7. The sealed area 87 is sealed by at least a first 84 sealing member. The injecting member 92 comprises a piston 94 that pushes said fluid 93 into the sealed area 87. Fig. 114 shows the sealed area 87, sealed by the first 84 and second 86 sealing member together with the caput femur 5 and the pelvic bone 9.
