Example 341A
tert-Butyl 2-{[3-ethyl-5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1-(tetrahydrofuran-2-ylmethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl]methyl}hydrazinecarboxylate (racemate)
To a solution of 1.40 g (3.21 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 335A in 32 ml of methanol were added 1.01 g (16.0 mmol) of sodium cyanoborohydride and a little Bromocresol Green. Subsequently, a sufficient amount of acetic acid was added by titration that the indicator colour just changed from blue to yellow. Then the reaction mixture was heated to 65Â° C. After 1 h, after 3 h and after 4 h, a further 0.50 g (8.0 mmol) of sodium cyanoborohydride were added in each case. Over the entire reaction time, by addition of further acetic acid, the pH was constantly regulated such that the indicator colour just remained yellow. After a total of 5 h, the volatile constituents of the reaction mixture were substantially removed on a rotary evaporator. The remaining residue was taken up in ethyl acetate and washed successively with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution, water and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, the mixture was filtered and concentrated to dryness. The crude product was stirred with acetonitrile. The solid was filtered off with suction and dried under high vacuum. 900 mg (64% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
