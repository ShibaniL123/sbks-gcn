Step 4: Preparation of 2-[3-[4-([1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-5-)pyrazole-1-] -1-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)azetidine- 3-]acetonitrile
2-[3-[4-([1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin- 5-) pyrazole-1-] azetidine- 3-]acetonitrile(60 mg, 214.8 umol) was dissolved in DCM(2 mL), DMAP(13 mg, 107.4 umol) and Et3N(109 mg, 1.1 mmol) were added, then trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride(47 mg, 279.3 umol) was add dropwise at 15°C. The reaction mixture was stirred at 15°C for reacting for 4 hours. LC-MS showed that the raw material was completely reacted, and the target product MS was detected. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove solvent and give 2-[3-[4-([1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-5-) pyrazole-1-] -1-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)azetidine- 3-]acetonitrile(25 mg, 28.3%yield) through preparative HPLC(alkalinity).
