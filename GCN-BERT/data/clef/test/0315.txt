TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a method for producing hydroxy-L-lysine using a novel lysine hydroxylase, and a method for producing hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid using the resulting hydroxy-L-lysine. BACKGROUND ART Hydroxy-L-lysine is an intermediate useful as an intermediate for pharmaceuticals and the like. For example, it is known that (3R)-hydroxy-L-lysine can be used as a precursor of a protein kinase C inhibitor (−)-balanol (Non-patent Document 1), and that (5R)-hydroxy-L-lysine can be used as a precursor of Bengamide B, which has antitumor activity (Non-patent Document 2). Hydroxy-L-lysine is reported to be useful as a material of hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid (Non-patent Documents 3 and 4). For example, (4R)-hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid can be used as a precursor of an HIV protease inhibitor palinavir (Non-patent Document 5), and (5S)-hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid and (5R)-hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid can be used as precursors of antimicrobial agents (Patent Document 1). Examples of reported methods for synthesizing hydroxy-L-lysine include a method for synthesizing (3R)-hydroxy-L-lysine by asymmetric hydrogenation using a Ru catalyst (Non-patent Document 1). Amino acid hydroxylases are useful enzymes for production of intermediates for pharmaceuticals and the like, and proline 4-hydroxylase (Non-patent Document 6) and L-isoleucine dioxygenase (Non-patent Document 7) have been reported before. However, enzymes that act on L-lysine have not yet been reported.

Microbiol., 2011, 77, 6926 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention In the synthesis method for hydroxy-L-lysine described in Non-patent Document 1, preparation of the material is laborious, and the cost of preparation and recycling of the catalyst is high. Therefore, a more efficient synthesis method has been demanded. An object of the present invention is to provide a novel, inexpensive, and simple method for production of hydroxy-L-lysine having higher optical purity. Means for Solving the Problems In order to solve the above problems, the present inventors intensively studied on a method for producing optically active hydroxy-L-lysine.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating conversion of L-lysine to 4-hydroxylysine by Hyl-1, 3, 4, or 5. FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating conversion of L-lysine to 3-hydroxylysine by Hyl-2 or 6. MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The present invention is described below in detail. <Method for Production of Hydroxy-L-Lysine Using 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent L-Lysine Hydroxylase> The method for producing hydroxy-L-lysine of the present invention comprises allowing 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase, a cell containing 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase, a processed product of the cell, and/or a culture broth obtained by culturing the cell, to act on L-lysine. As described later, the method of the present invention is preferably carried out in the presence of 2-oxoglutaric acid and ferrous ion. Since the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase used in the present invention (hereinafter also referred to as “L-lysine hydroxylase of the present invention”) has high regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in hydroxylation of L-lysine, highly optically pure hydroxy-L-lysine can be efficiently obtained using it. The L-lysine hydroxylase in the present invention is not limited as long as the L-lysine hydroxylase has 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase activity. Preferably, the L-lysine hydroxylase has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12, or is a homologue of the amino acid sequence having 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase activity. That is, the L-lysine hydroxylase of the present invention preferably comprises the polypeptide of the following (A), (B), or (C): (A) a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12;(B) a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 except that one or several amino acids are deleted, substituted, and/or added, which polypeptide has 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase activity; or(C) a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence with an identity of not less an 60% to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12, which polypeptide has 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase activity. Examples of the homologue of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 which can be used in the present invention include, as described above in (B), a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 except that one or several amino acids are deleted, substituted, and/or added as long as the polypeptide retains 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase activity. The term “one or several amino acids” herein means, for example, 1 to 100, preferably 1 to 50, more preferably 1 to 20, still more preferably 1 to 10, especially preferably 1 to 5, amino acids. As described above in (C), the homologue may also be a protein with a sequence identity of at least not less than 60%, preferably not less than 80%, more preferably not less than 90%, still more preferably not less than 95% to the entire amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 as long as the protein has 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase activity. In the present description, the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase activity means activity that adds a hydroxyl group to the carbon atom(s) at the 3-position, 4-position, and/or 5-position of L-lysine in a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent manner. Such activity can be confirmed by allowing the protein of interest, a cell expressing the protein, and/or a processed product of the cell to act as an enzyme in a reaction system comprising L-lysine as a substrate and 2-oxoglutaric acid as a coenzyme, and then measuring production of hydroxy-L-lysine as described below in the Examples. The amino acid sequences of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are based on the genomic information of Flavobacterium johnsoniae UW101 strain, Kineococcus radiotolerans SRS30216 strain, Chitinophaga pinensis DSM2588 strain, Chryseobacterium gleum ATCC35910 strain, Niastella koreensis GR20-10 strain, and marine actinobacterium PHSC20C1, respectively. The amino acid sequences of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are identical to GenBank accession Nos. ABQ06186, ABS05421, ACU60313, EFK34737, AEV99100, and EAR24255, respectively, which are amino acid sequences translated from DNA sequences predicted to encode proteins. None of these amino acid sequences have been reported to actually exist based on, for example, isolation of the proteins, and their protein functions have been totally unknown. Since the L-lysine hydroxylases of the present invention comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 6, 8, or 10 hydroxylate the 4-position of L-lysine, (2S,4R) hydroxy L-lysine can be produced thereby. Among these sequences, SEQ ID NO:8 is preferred because of high yield. Since the L-lysine hydroxylases of the present invention comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4 or 12 hydroxylate the 3-position of L-lysine, (2S,3S) hydroxy L-lysine can be produced thereby. Among these sequences, SEQ ID NO:12 is preferred because of high yield. In the production method of the present invention, a plurality of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylases may be used in combination. A 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase which can be used in the present invention can be obtained by purification from Flavobacterium johnsoniae, Kineococcus radiotolerans, Chitinophaga pinensis, Chryseobacterium gleum, Niastella koreensis, or marine actinobacterium, and can also be obtained by cloning of DNA encoding 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase using a known method such as PCR or hybridization, followed by allowing expression of the enzyme in an appropriate host. Examples of the DNA encoding 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 include DNAs comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11, respectively, and the DNA encoding 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase may be a homologue of DNA comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 as long as the homologue encodes a protein having 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase activity. That is, examples of the DNA encoding the L-lysine hydroxylase of the present invention include the nucleotide sequences shown in the following (D), (E), and (F). (D) DNA comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11; (E) DNA comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 except that one or several nucleotides are substituted, deleted, and/or added, which DNA encodes a polypeptide having 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase activity; or (F) DNA comprising a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes with the complementary strand of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 under stringent conditions, which DNA encodes a polypeptide having 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase activity. As described in (E), examples of the homologue include homologues comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 except that one or several nucleotides are substituted, deleted, and/or added. The term “one or several nucleotides” herein means, for example, 1 to 300, preferably 1 to 150, more preferably 1 to 60, still more preferably 1 to 30, especially preferably 1 to 15, nucleotides. As described in (F), the DNA homologue may be a DNA which hybridizes with the complementary strand of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 under stringent conditions as long as the DNA homologue encodes a protein having 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase activity. Examples of the “stringent conditions” herein include conditions under which washing is carried out with 0.1×SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60° C. Those skilled in the art can obtain the DNA homologue described above by introducing, as appropriate, a substitution, deletion, insertion, and/or addition mutation(s) to the DNA of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 by site-specific mutagenesis (Nucleic Acids Res. 10, pp. 6487 (1982), Methods in Enzymol. 100, pp. 448 (1983), Molecular Cloning, PCR A Practical Approach IRL Press pp. 200 (1991)) or the like. It is also possible to obtain amino acid information of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase activity or nucleotide sequence information of DNA encoding it, by carrying out homology search using the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 or part thereof, or the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 or part thereof against a database such as DNA Databank of JAPAN (DDBJ). In the method for producing hydroxy-L-lysine of the present invention, 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase may be directly used for the reaction, but it is preferred to use a cell containing 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase, a processed product thereof, and/or a culture broth obtained by culturing the cell. The cell containing 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase may be a cell such as a microorganism which inherently has 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase, but it is preferred to use a cell such as a microorganism transformed with a gene encoding 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase. The cell may be either a dead cell or live cell, and, for example, a resting cell or the like may be preferably used. Examples of the processed product of the cell containing 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase include: processed cell products such as products prepared by treatment with an organic solvent, for example, acetone, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or toluene, products prepared by treatment with a surfactant, products prepared by lyophilization, and products prepared by physical or enzymatic disruption; products prepared by extracting an enzyme fraction from the cell as a crude product or purified product; and products prepared by immobilizing any of these products on a carrier such as polyacrylamide gel, carrageenan gel, or the like. Examples of the culture broth obtained by culturing the cell containing 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase include a suspension of the cell in a liquid medium, and, in cases where the cell is a secretory expression cell, examples of the culture broth include the supernatant obtained by removing the cell by centrifugation or the like, and a concentrate of the supernatant. By inserting the thus isolated DNA encoding 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase into a known expression vector such that expression of the enzyme is possible, a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase expression vector can be provided. By transforming a host cell with this expression vector, a transformant in which the DNA encoding 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase is introduced can be obtained. The transformant can also be obtained by incorporating the DNA encoding 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase into the chromosomal DNA of a host by homologous recombination or the like such that expression of the enzyme is possible. Specific examples of the method for preparing the transformant include a method in which the DNA encoding 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase is introduced into a plasmid vector, phage vector, or virus vector which can be stably present in a host cell such as a microorganism, and the constructed expression vector is then introduced into the host cell, or a method in which the DNA is directly introduced into the host genome, and the genetic information is then transcribed and translated. In this process, an appropriate promoter is preferably linked to 5′-upstream of the DNA, and, in addition, an appropriate terminator is more preferably linked to 3′-downstream of the DNA in the host. Such a promoter and terminator are not limited as long as the promoter and the terminator are known to function in the cell to be used as the host. For example, “Fundamental Microbiology 8: Genetic Engineering, KYORITSU SHUPPAN CO., LTD.” describes details of vectors, promoters, and terminators that can be used in host microorganisms. The host microorganism to be transformed for expression of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase is not limited as long as the host itself does not adversely affect the reaction of L-lysine, and specific examples of the host microorganism include the following microorganisms: bacteria belonging to the genera Escherichia, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, and the like whose host vector systems have been established; actinomycetes belonging to the genera Rhodococcus, Streptomyces, and the like whose host vector systems have been established; yeasts belonging to the genera Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Schizosaccharomyces, Zygosaccharomyces, Yarrowia, Trichosporon, Rhodosporidium, Hansenula, Pichia, Candida, and the like whose host vector systems have been established; and molds belonging to the genera Neurospora, Aspergillus, Cephalosporium, Trichoderma, and the like whose host vector systems have been established. The procedure for construction of the transformant, the method for construction of a recombinant vector suitable for the host, and the method for culturing the host can be carried out according to techniques commonly used in the fields of molecular biology, bioengineering, and genetic engineering (for example, methods described in Molecular Cloning). The following are examples of preferred host microorganisms, and preferred examples of the method of transformation, vector, promoter, terminator, and the like for each microorganism. The present invention is not limited by these examples. For the genus Escherichia, especially Escherichia coli, examples of the plasmid vector include pBR and pUC plasmids, and examples of the promoter include promoters derived from lac (β-galactosidase), trp (tryptophan operon), tac, trc (fusion of lac and trp), and A phage PL and PR. Examples of the terminator include terminators derived from trpA, phages, and rrnB ribosomal RNA. For the genus Bacillus, examples of the vector include pUB110 plasmids and pC194 plasmids. Integration into the chromosome is also possible. Examples of the promoter and the terminator include those of genes of enzymes such as alkaline protease, neutral protease, and α-amylase. For the genus Pseudomonas, examples of the vector include common host vector systems established in Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas cepacia, and the like; and a wide-host-range vector (containing genes required for autonomous replication derived from RSF1010 and the like) pKT240, which is based on a plasmid involved in degradation of toluene compounds, TOL plasmid (Gene, 26, 273-82 (1983)). For the genus Brevibacterium, especially Brevibacterium lactofermentum, examples of the vector include plasmid vectors such as pAJ43 (Gene 39, 281 (1985)). Examples of the promoter and the terminator include promoters and terminators used in E. coli. For the genus Corynebacterium, especially Corynebacterium glutamicum, examples of the vector include plasmid vectors such as pCS11 (JP 57-183799 A) and pCB101 (Mol. Gen. Genet. 196, 175 (1984)). For Saccharomyces, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae, examples of the vector include YRp, YEp, YCp, and Ylp plasmids. Examples of promoters and terminators which may be used include those of the genes of enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, β-galactosidase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and enolase. For the genus Schizosaccharomyces, examples of the vector include the plasmid vector derived from Schizosaccharomyces pombe described in Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 80 (1986). In particular, pAUR224 is commercially available from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., and can be easily used. In terms of the genus Aspergillus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae and the like are the best-studied species among molds. Plasmids, and integration into the chromosome are applicable to these species, and promoters for extracellular protease and amylase can be used (Trends in Biotechnology 7, 283-287 (1989)). Host vector systems other than the above-described systems have also been established for various microorganisms, and those systems may be used as appropriate. Various host/vector systems have been established for plants and animals, in addition to microorganisms. In particular, systems for allowing expression of a large amount of foreign protein in an animal such as an insect (e.g., silkworm) (Nature 315, 592-594 (1985)), or in a plant such as rapeseed, maize, or potato; and systems based on cell-free protein synthesis systems such as E. coli cell-free extracts and wheat germs; have been established, and may be preferably used. In the production method of the present invention, 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase, a cell containing the enzyme, a processed product of the cell, and/or a culture broth obtained by culturing the cell, is/are allowed to act on a reaction substrate L-lysine in the presence of 2-oxoglutaric acid, to produce hydroxy-L-lysine represented by the following General Formula (I): (wherein each of R1, R2 and R3 represents a hydrogen atom or hydroxyl group, with the proviso that at least one of R1, R2 and R3 represents a hydroxyl group). R1, R2 and R3 in the General Formula (I) may be selected in consideration of the compound which is to be finally obtained. In particular, one or two of R1, R2 and R3 is/are preferably a hydroxyl group(s), and one of R1, R2 and R3 is more preferably a hydroxyl group. The production method of the present invention is not limited as long as 2-oxoglutaric acid; and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase, a cell containing the enzyme, a processed product of the cell, and/or a culture broth obtained by culturing the cell; can be allowed to act on L-lysine. The method is normally preferably carried out in an aqueous medium, or a mixture of the aqueous medium and an organic solvent. The method of the present invention is more preferably carried out in the presence of ferrous ion. Examples of the aqueous medium include water and buffers. Examples of the organic solvent include those in which the reaction substrate is highly soluble, such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, tert-butanol, acetone, and dimethyl sulfoxide. Other examples of the organic solvent include ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, toluene, chloroform, and n-hexane, which are effective for removal of reaction by-products and the like. The reaction substrate L-lysine is usually used at a substrate concentration within the range of 0.01% w/v to 90% w/v, preferably 0.1% w/v to 30% w/v. The reaction substrate may be added at once when the reaction is started, but is preferably added continuously or intermittently in view of reducing an effect of substrate inhibition of the enzyme, if any, and increasing the concentration of the product accumulated. The number of moles of the 2-oxoglutaric acid required for the reaction is normally equivalent to, or higher than, that of the substrate, preferably equivalent to, or up to 1.2-fold higher than, that of the substrate. The 2-oxoglutaric acid may be added at once when the reaction is started, but is preferably added continuously or intermittently in view of reducing an inhibitory action on the enzyme, if any, and increasing the concentration of the product accumulated. Alternatively, an inexpensive compound that can be metabolized by the host, such as glucose, may be added instead of 2-oxoglutaric acid to allow metabolism of the compound by the host, and 2-oxoglutaric acid produced during this process may be used for the reaction. The production method of the present invention is preferably carried out in the presence of ferrous ion. The ferrous ion is preferably used within the range of usually 0.01 mM to 100 mM, preferably 0.1 mM to 10 mM. The ferrous ion may be added as iron sulfate or the like at once when the reaction is started. Further addition of the ferrous ion during the reaction is also effective when the ferrous ion added was oxidized into ferric ion, or decreased due to formation of precipitation. In cases where the L-lysine hydroxylase, cell containing the enzyme, processed product of the cell, and/or culture broth obtained by culturing the cell, in the present invention already contain(s) a sufficient amount of ferrous ion, the addition of the ion is not necessarily required. The reaction is carried out at a reaction temperature of usually 4° C. to 60° C., preferably 10° C. to 45° C., at a pH of usually 3 to 11, preferably 5 to 8.

Examples of the method for producing hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid from hydroxy-L-lysine include the 3 kinds of methods described below. The first method of the present invention for producing hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid from hydroxy-L-lysine is as follows. <I> A method for producing hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid, which method comprises: allowing hydroxy-L-lysine to react with <I-1> at least one enzyme selected from the group consisting of L-amino acid oxidase, L-amino acid dehydrogenase, and L-amino acid transferase, or with <I-2> amino acid racemase and at least one enzyme selected from the group consisting of D-amino acid oxidase, D-amino acid dehydrogenase, and D-amino acid transferase, to produce a cyclic amino acid having a double bond at the 1-position represented by General Formula (II); and allowing N-methyl-L-amino acid dehydrogenase to act on the resulting cyclic amino acid having a double bond at the 1-position to produce hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid represented by the following General Formula (III): (wherein each of R1, R2 and R3 represents a hydrogen atom or hydroxyl group, with the proviso that at least one of R1, R2 and R3 represents a hydroxyl group). The method is described below by way of exemplary schemes. Scheme 1-1 uses N-methyl-L-amino acid dehydrogenase and at least one enzyme selected from the group consisting of L-amino acid oxidase, L-amino acid dehydrogenase, and L-amino acid transferase (wherein, in the formula, each of R1, R2 and R3 represents a hydrogen atom or hydroxyl group, with the proviso that at least one of R1, R2 and R3 represents a hydroxyl group). First, using the enzyme(s) selected from the group consisting of L-amino acid oxidase, L-amino acid dehydrogenase, and L-amino acid transferase, the compound (a) (hydroxy-L-lysine) is converted to the compound (b). This is followed by spontaneous conversion of the compound (b) to the compound (c). Subsequently, the compound (c) is converted to the compound (d) (hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid) by N-methyl-L-amino acid dehydrogenase (NMAADH). The L-amino acid oxidase herein is not limited as long as the L-amino acid oxidase can catalyze a reaction in which the amino group at the 2-position of hydroxy-L-lysine is converted to an oxo group.

First, the compound (a) (hydroxy-L-lysine) is converted to the D-isomer compound (a′) (hydroxy-D-lysine) by amino acid racemase, and the compound (a′) is then converted to the compound (b) by an enzyme(s) selected from the group consisting of D-amino acid oxidase, D-amino acid dehydrogenase, and D-amino acid transferase. This is followed by spontaneous conversion of the compound (b) to the compound (c). The compound (c) is then converted to the compound (d) (hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid) by N-methyl-L-amino acid dehydrogenase (NMAADH). The amino acid racemase is not limited as long as the amino acid racemase can catalyze a reaction in which hydroxy-L-lysine is converted to hydroxy-D-lysine. Examples of the amino acid racemase include proteins comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:30, and proteins comprising an amino acid sequence with an identity of not less than 80%, preferably not less than 90%, more preferably not less than 95% to SEQ ID NO:30, while retaining the activity. The D-amino acid oxidase is not limited as long as the D-amino acid oxidase can catalyze a reaction in which the amino group at the 2-position of hydroxy-D-lysine is converted to an oxo group. Examples of the D-amino acid oxidase include proteins comprising the amino acid sequence described in Biochemistry, 2005, 70, 40, and proteins comprising an amino acid sequence with an identity of not less than 80%, preferably not less than 90%, more preferably not less than 95% to the amino acid sequence, while retaining the activity. The D-amino acid dehydrogenase is not limited as long as the D-amino acid dehydrogenase can catalyze a reaction in which the amino group at the 2-position of hydroxy-D-lysine is converted to an oxo group.

The D-amino acid transferase (D-amino acid aminotransferase) is not limited as long as the D-amino acid transferase can catalyze a reaction in which the amino group at the 2-position of hydroxy-D-lysine is converted to an oxo group.

Examples of the N-methyl-L-amino acid dehydrogenase include proteins comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:24, and proteins comprising an amino acid sequence with an identity of not less than 80%, preferably not less than 90%, more preferably not less than 95% to SEQ ID NO:24, while retaining the activity. In each of Scheme 1-1 and Scheme 1-2, the enzymatic reactions may be carried out separately, but the reactions are preferably carried out continuously in a single reaction system. More preferably, the reactions are carried out by allowing cells containing the enzymes which catalyze the reactions to react with hydroxy-L-lysine. Although the cells containing the enzymes which catalyze the reactions may be microorganism cells intrinsically having these enzymes, it is preferred to use cells transformed with DNA encoding the enzymes. In Scheme 1-1, the cells to be used are preferably cells transformed with DNA encoding at least one enzyme selected from the group consisting of L-amino acid oxidase, L-amino acid dehydrogenase, and L-amino acid transferase, and DNA encoding N-methyl-L-amino acid dehydrogenase. In Scheme 1-2, the cells to be used are preferably cells transformed with DNA encoding at least one enzyme selected from the group consisting of D-amino acid oxidase, D-amino acid dehydrogenase, and D-amino acid transferase, DNA encoding amino acid racemase, and DNA encoding N-methyl-L-amino acid dehydrogenase. The cells may be prepared by incorporating each of these DNAs into the chromosome; by introducing these DNAs into a single vector and then transforming the host with the single vector; or by separately introducing the DNAs into vectors and then transforming the host with these vectors. The method for transformation of the host cells such as microorganism cells, the type of the host, and the like are the same as those described in the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase section. Since N-methyl-L-amino acid dehydrogenase requires NAD(P)H as a co-enzyme, an NAD(P)H-regenerating system is preferably allowed to coexist. That is, in cases where the NAD(P)H is added, NAD(P)+ generated from the NAD(P)H is preferably regenerated into NAD(P)H from the viewpoint of increasing the production efficiency. Examples of the regeneration method include: 1) a method in which the NAD(P)+-reducing capacity of the host microorganism itself is used; 2) a method in which a microorganism(s) having a capacity to generate NAD(P)H from NAD(P)+, a processed product(s) thereof, and/or an enzyme (s) (regenerating enzyme(s)) which can be used for regeneration of NAD(P)H, such as glucose dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, amino acid dehydrogenase, and/or organic acid dehydrogenase (for example, malate dehydrogenase), is/are added to the reaction system; and 3) a method in which, in production of the transformant, one or more of the genes of the regenerating enzymes which can be used for the regeneration of NAD(P)H is introduced into the host together with the DNA in the present invention. In particular, in the method 1), glucose, ethanol, formic acid, and/or the like is/are preferably added to the reaction system. Examples of microorganisms/processed products/enzymes which may be used in the method 2) include microorganisms containing the regenerating enzymes; processed products of these microorganisms such as acetone-treated products, lyophilized products, and physically or enzymatically disrupted products; fractions of the enzymes extracted as crude products or purified products; and products prepared by immobilizing any of these products on a carrier such as polyacrylamide gel, carrageenan gel, or the like. Alternatively, a commercially available enzyme(s) may be used. In such cases, addition of one or more of compounds to be used as substrates for the regenerating enzymes, such as glucose in cases of use of glucose dehydrogenase, formic acid in cases of use of formate dehydrogenase, and ethanol or isopropanol in cases of use of alcohol dehydrogenase, is necessary. In cases where the reactions of Scheme 1-1 or Scheme 1-2 are continuously carried out in a single reaction system, the scheme is preferably carried out in an aqueous medium or a mixture of the aqueous medium and an organic solvent(s) containing hydroxy-L-lysine, cells transformed with genes encoding the enzymes, a processed product of the transformed cells, and/or a culture broth obtained by culturing the transformed cells. Examples of the aqueous medium include water and buffers. Examples of the organic solvent include those in which the reaction substrate is highly soluble, such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, tert-butanol, acetone, and dimethyl sulfoxide. Other examples of the organic solvent include ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, toluene, chloroform, and n-hexane, which are effective for removal of reaction by-products and the like. The reaction substrate hydroxy-L-lysine is usually used at a substrate concentration within the range of 0.01% w/v to 90% w/v, preferably 0.1% w/v to 30% w/v. The reaction substrate may be added at once when the reaction is started, but is preferably added continuously or intermittently in view of reducing an effect of substrate inhibition of the enzyme, if any, and increasing the concentration of the product accumulated. If necessary, a coenzyme(s) such as NAD(P)H is/are normally added at 0.001 mM to 100 mM, preferably 0.01 mM to 10 mM. The reaction is carried out at a reaction temperature of usually 4° C. to 60° C., preferably 10° C. to 45° C., at a pH of usually 3 to 11, preferably 5 to 8. The reaction time is usually about 1 hour to about 72 hours. The hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid produced by the method of the present invention can be purified, after the reaction, by separating cells and proteins in the reaction mixture by centrifugation, membrane treatment, and/or the like, and then performing an appropriate combination of methods such as extraction with an organic solvent(s), for example, 1-butanol and/or tert-butanol; distillation; column chromatography using an ion-exchange resin(s), silica gel, and/or the like; isoelectric crystallization; and/or crystallization with monohydrochloride, dihydrochloride, and/or calcium salt. The second method of the present invention for producing hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid from hydroxy-L-lysine is as follows. <II> A method for producing hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid, which method comprises: allowing hydroxy-L-lysine to react with at least one enzyme selected from the group consisting of L-lysine 6-oxidase, L-lysine 6-dehydrogenase, and L-lysine 6-transferase to produce a cyclic amino acid having a double bond at the 6-position represented by General Formula (IV); andallowing pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase to act on the resulting cyclic amino acid having a double bond at the 6-position to produce hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid represented by General Formula (III): (wherein each of R1, R2 and R3 represents a hydrogen atom or hydroxyl group, with the proviso that at least one of R1, R2 and R3 represents a hydroxyl group). The method is described below by way of an exemplary scheme (in the formula, each of R1, R2 and R3 represents a hydrogen atom or hydroxyl group, with the proviso that at least one of R1, R2 and R3 represents a hydroxyl group). First, the compound (a) (hydroxy-L-lysine) is converted to the compound (b) by at least one enzyme selected from the group consisting of L-lysine 6-oxidase, L-lysine 6-dehydrogenase, and L-lysine 6-transferase, and this is followed by spontaneous conversion of the compound (b′) to the compound (c′). The compound (c′) is then converted to the compound (d) (hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid) by pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) reductase. The L-lysine 6-oxidase is not limited as long as the L-lysine 6-oxidase can catalyze a reaction in which the amino group at the 6-position of hydroxy-L-lysine is converted to an oxo group. Examples of the L-lysine 6-oxidase include proteins comprising the amino acid sequence of IodA described in Biochim. Biophys. Acta., 2006, 1764 1577, and proteins comprising an amino acid sequence with an identity of not less than 80%, preferably not less than 90%, more preferably not less than 95% to the amino acid sequence of IodA, while retaining the activity. The L-lysine 6-dehydrogenase is not limited as long as the L-lysine 6-dehydrogenase can catalyze a reaction in which the amino group at the 6-position of hydroxy-L-lysine is converted to an oxo group. Examples of the L-lysine 6-dehydrogenase include proteins comprising the amino acid sequence described in J. Biochem., 105, 1002-1008 (1989), and proteins comprising an amino acid sequence with an identity of not less than 80%, preferably not less than 90%, more preferably not less than 95% to the amino acid sequence, while retaining the activity. The L-lysine 6-transferase (lysine-6-aminotransferase) is not limited as long as the L-lysine 6-transferase can catalyze a reaction in which the amino group at the 6-position of hydroxy-L-lysine is converted to an oxo group. Examples of the L-lysine 6-transferase include proteins comprising the amino acid sequence described in WO 2001/048216, and proteins comprising an amino acid sequence with an identity of not less than 80%, preferably not less than 90%, more preferably not less than 95% to the amino acid sequence, while retaining the activity. The pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) reductase is not limited as long as the pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase can catalyze a reaction in which the compound represented by General Formula (IV) is converted to hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid represented by General Formula (III). Examples of the pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase include proteins comprising the amino acid sequence described in WO 2001/048216, and proteins comprising an amino acid sequence with an identity of not less than 80%, preferably not less than 90%, more preferably not less than 95% to the amino acid sequence, while retaining the activity Although the enzymatic reactions in Scheme 2 may be carried out separately, the reactions are preferably carried out continuously in a single reaction system. More preferably, the reactions are carried out by allowing cells containing the enzymes which catalyze the reactions to react with hydroxy-L-lysine. Although the cells containing the enzymes which catalyze the reactions may be cells intrinsically having these enzymes, it is preferred to use cells transformed with DNA encoding the enzymes. More specifically, it is preferred to use cells transformed with DNA encoding at least one enzyme selected from the group consisting of L-lysine 6-oxidase, L-lysine 6-dehydrogenase, and L-lysine 6-transferase, and DNA encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) reductase. The method for transformation of the host cells such as microorganism cells, the type of the host, and the like are the same as those described in the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase section. In cases where the reactions of Scheme 2 are continuously carried out in a single reaction system, the scheme is preferably carried out in an aqueous medium or a mixture of the aqueous medium and an organic solvent(s), containing hydroxy-L-lysine, cells transformed with genes encoding the enzymes, a processed product of the transformed cells, and/or a culture broth obtained by culturing the transformed cells. The reaction conditions, addition and regeneration of co-enzyme, and the method of recovery of hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid are the same as those described in the section <I>. The third method of the present invention for producing hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid from hydroxy-L-lysine is as follows. <III> A method for producing hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid, which method comprises allowing lysine cyclodeaminase to act on hydroxy-L-lysine to produce hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid represented by General Formula (III). The lysine cyclodeaminase is not limited as long as the lysine cyclodeaminase can catalyze a reaction in which hydroxy-L-lysine is converted to hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid. Examples of the lysine cyclodeaminase include proteins comprising the amino acid sequence described in Biochimie 2007, 89, 591, and proteins comprising an amino acid sequence with an identity of not less than 80%, preferably not less than 90%, more preferably not less than 95% to the amino acid sequence, while retaining the activity. The reaction by lysine cyclodeaminase is preferably carried out by allowing cells containing lysine cyclodeaminase to react with hydroxy-L-lysine. Although the microorganism containing lysine cyclodeaminase may be cells intrinsically having the enzyme, it is preferred to use cells transformed with DNA encoding lysine cyclodeaminase. The method for transformation of the host cells such as microorganism cells, the type of the host, and the like are the same as those described in the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase section. In cases where the reaction of converting hydroxy-L-lysine to hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid by lysine cyclodeaminase is carried out, the reaction is preferably carried out in an aqueous medium or a mixture of the aqueous medium and an organic solvent(s), containing hydroxy-L-lysine, cells transformed with DNA encoding lysine cyclodeaminase, a processed product of the transformed cells, and/or a culture broth obtained by culturing the transformed cells. The reaction conditions, addition and regeneration of co-enzyme, and the method of recovery of hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid are the same as those described in the section <I>. It is also possible to produce hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid directly from L-lysine using, at once, 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase and an enzyme(s) which convert(s) hydroxy-L-lysine to hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid. However, since the enzyme(s) which convert(s) hydroxy-L-lysine to hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid may act on L-lysine to cause by-production of L-pipecolic acid before the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase acts on L-lysine, the enzyme(s) which convert(s) hydroxy-L-lysine to hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid need(s) to be an enzyme(s) which preferentially act(s) on hydroxy-L-lysine rather than L-lysine. In such cases, the host cells may be transformed at once with DNA for 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine hydroxylase and DNA for the enzyme(s) which convert(s) hydroxy-L-lysine to hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid. In cases where hydroxy-L-lysine produced by the method of the present invention is used for production of hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid, purification of the hydroxy-L-lysine may be omitted, and the only purification to be carried out may be purification after the conversion to hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid. EXAMPLES The present invention is described below in more detail by way of Examples, but the present invention is not limited by these. Example 1 Cloning of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent L-lysine Hydroxylase Gene Based on a gene sequence (hyl-1, SEQ ID NO:1) encoding an L-arginine-6 hydroxylase VioC homologue Hyl-1 derived from the Flavobacterium johnsoniae NBRC14942 strain (GenBank Accession No. ABQ06186, SEQ ID NO:2), primers for amplifying the full-length sequence of the hyl-1 gene, hyl1_F (SEQ ID NO:13) and hyl1_R (SEQ ID NO:14), were designed and synthesized. Using chromosomal DNA of Flavobacterium johnsoniae as a template, PCR was carried out according to a conventional method, to obtain a DNA fragment of about 1.0 kbp. In addition, VioC homologues derived from the Kineococcus radiotolerans NBRC101839 strain, Chitinophaga pinensis NBRC15968 strain, Chryseobacterium gleum NBRC15054 strain, and Niastella koreensis NBRC106392 strain were designated Hyl-2 (GenBank Accession No. ABS05421, SEQ ID NO:4), Hyl-3 (GenBank Accession No. ACU60313, SEQ ID NO:6), Hyl-4 (GenBank Accession No. EFK34737, SEQ ID NO:8), and Hyl-5 (GenBank Accession No. AEV99100, SEQ ID NO:10), respectively.

Each reaction produced a DNA fragment of about 1.0 kbp. Each of the 5 kinds of DNA fragments obtained was digested with restriction enzymes Ndel and Xhol, and ligated into Ndel/Xhol-digested pET21a (Novagen) according to a conventional method, to obtain pEHYL1, pEHYL2, pEHYL3, pEHYL4, and pEHYL5, respectively. A gene sequence (hyl-6, SEQ ID NO:11) encoding Hyl-6 (GenBank Accession No. EAR24255, SEQ ID NO:12), which was derived from a marine actinobacterium PHSC20C1, was artificially synthesized by DNA2.0, Inc., and inserted into pJExpress401 (DNA2.0) to prepare a plasmid pJHYL6. Subsequently, E. coli (Eschelichia coli) BL21(DE3) (manufactured by Invitrogen) was transformed with each of the resulting plasmids according to a conventional method, to obtain recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3)/pEHYL1, BL21(DE3)/pEHYL2, BL21(DE3)/pEHYL3, BL21(DE3)/pEHYL4, BL21(DE3)/pEHYL5, and BL21(DE3)/pJHYL6. In order to obtain bacterial cells expressing the introduced genes, each type of recombinant E. coli was cultured at 30° C. using liquid LB medium supplemented with ampicillin and a lac promoter inducer, and collected at Hour 20 of the culture. Example 2 Confirmation of 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent L-Lysine Hydroxylase Activity by Resting-Cell Reaction In a plastic tube, 5 mM L-lysine, 10 mM 2-oxoglutaric acid, 1 mM L-ascorbic acid, 0.1 mM iron sulfate, and recombinant E. coli obtained by the method according to Example 1 were mixed to provide a reaction mixture such that the turbidity OD600 was 10. The reaction was allowed to proceed in 0.5 ml of the prepared mixture at 30° C. at pH 7.0 for 3 hours. The reaction product was derivatized with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alaninamide (FDAA), and then analyzed by HPLC. As a result, as shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, it could be confirmed that BL21(DE3)/pEHYL2 and BL21(DE3)/pJHYL6 produced a compound corresponding to the retention time of a standard product of 3-hydroxylysine, 8.04 minutes. It could also be confirmed that BL21(DE3)/pEHYL1, BL21(DE3)/pEHYL3, BL21(DE3)/pEHYL4, and BL21(DE3)/pEHYL5 produced a compound corresponding to the retention time of a standard product of 4-hydroxylysine, 8.16 minutes.

Example 3 Synthesis of (2S,3S)-3-Hydroxylysine In a 1-L jar fermenter, 35 mL of 1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 304 mL of desalted water, 1.28 g of L-lysine hydrochloride, 2.05 g of 2-oxoglutaric acid, 0.14 g of sodium L-ascorbate, 0.02 g of iron sulfate, 0.35 g of Adekanol LG109, and 8 g of wet cells of recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3)/pEHYL2 obtained by the method according to Example 1 were mixed together, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 30° C., pH 7.0, a stirring rate of 500 rpm, and an aeration rate of 2.0 vvm for 17 hours. Completion of the reaction was judged by confirming disappearance of the peak for L-lysine by HPLC analysis. From the liquid after the completion of the reaction, bacterial cells and bacterial debris were removed by centrifugation and microfiltration, to obtain 390 g of a filtrate. The conditions for analyzing the L-lysine by HPLC were as follows. Column, SUMICHIRAL OA-6100 (4.6 mm×250 mm), manufactured by Sumika Chemical Analysis Service, Ltd.; mobile phase, 1 mM copper sulfate; flow rate, 1.0 mL/minute; column temperature, 30° C.; and UV, 254 nm. After passing 390 g of the filtrate through an ion-exchange resin column (DIAION (registered trademark) SK-1B (Type H), 60.0 g), washing was carried out with water, followed by elution with an aqueous solution containing 150 mmol ammonia. The ammonia eluate was concentrated to obtain 1.0 g of (2S,3S)-3-hydroxylysine (6.17 mmol; yield, 88%). The results of measurement of physical properties of the resulting (2S,3S)-3-hydroxylysine were as follows. 1H-NMR (400 MHz, D2O) δ, 1.45-1.58 (2H, m), 1.63-1.73 (1H, m), 1.74-1.88 (1H, m), 2.93-3.04 (2H, m), 3.47 (1H, d, J=4.3 Hz), 3.89 (1H, dt, J=8.4, 4.5 Hz) Example 4 Determination of Stereochemistry of (2s,3s)-3-Hydroxylysine In a flask, 8.3 mg (0.051 mmol) of (2S,3S)-3-hydroxylysine obtained by the method according to Example 3, 0.26 ml of 1 mol/L aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, and 18 μl (0.13 mmol) of benzyloxycarbonyl chloride were placed, and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. To the mixture, 0.26 ml of 1 mol/L aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and 18 μl (0.13 mmol) of benzyloxycarbonyl chloride were further added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at room temperature. Subsequently, 0.5 ml of tetrahydrofuran was added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 60° C. for additional 2 hours. After cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, 95 mg of sodium hydroxide was added thereto, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was washed twice with toluene-tetrahydrofuran (1:1), and 250 μl of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to the reaction mixture to make the reaction mixture strongly acidic. After 3 times of washing with ethyl acetate, the aqueous layer was subjected to 4 times of extraction with 1-butanol.

Since a cross peak was found between the 3-position hydrogen atom (H4) and 4-position hydrogen atom (H5), but was not found between the 4-position and the 1′-position, the substituents at the 4-position and the 5-position could be confirmed to have the cis configuration. Since the absolute configuration of the lysine used in the enzymatic reaction was S, it could be confirmed that the 5-(3-benzyloxycarbonylaminopropyl)-2-oxo-4-oxazolidinecarboxylic acid obtained in the present Example has the stereochemistry of (4S,5S), and that 3-hydroxylysine as its material has the stereochemistry of (2S,3S).
