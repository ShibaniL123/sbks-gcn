BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a novel overtube, a kind of a sleeve, for use with an irrigation tip of a catheter in a suction-irrigation system for removing unwanted materials from a body cavity and delivering fluids thereto. 2. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART Overtubes are common tools that may be used with surgical equipment to help guide the equipment to its intended position in a body. Accordingly, the overtubes are in general equipped with blades for making incisions on the surfaces of a body. Take the laparoscopic operation as an example, an overtube is used to make an incision on the abdomen of a subject, and the surgical tools such as drainage tube or endoscope may subsequently be introduced into the body of the subject. Overtube may also be used with a drainage catheter, in which case, the drainage catheter is first inserted into the overtube, then an incision of the body is made by puncturing the body surface with the overtube having the drainage catheter inserted therein. After the incision is made, the overtube is then separated from the drainage catheter, in this way, the overtube help guide the draining catheter to its intended position in the body. There are two types of overtubes available on the market, one is retractable overtube, and the other is dis-assemble or removal overtube. The retractable type of overtube is commonly used with an endoscopic surgical tool, and is doubled-layers in structure. It comprises an outer layer, and a pin for making a puncture. After the puncture is made by the pin, the pin is retracted, whereas the outer layer of the overtube will then serve as a conduit for delivering other surgical tools (e.g., the endoscope or the drainage catheter) into the body. As to the dis-assemble or removal type of the overtube, it is generally designed to possess a built in mechanism that allows the overtube to be split in two halves when necessary, particularly during a surgery, so that the overtube may be completely removed and separated from the surgical tool. However, the choices of material suitable for making such type of overtubes are limited. The commercially available dis-assemble type of overtube is made by flexible plastic material that allows the overtube to be split in two halves easily, however, the flexible material also renders the creation of an incision on the body surface by the overtube difficult, if not impossible. Further, extra forces are required to split the overtube into two halves, which oftentimes cause unnecessary torn on the incision, or rendering it difficult for the attending physician to keep the irrigation tip in place. In view of the above, there exists in the related art an improved overtube that is free of the afore-mentioned problems commonly associated with the current commercially available overtube. SUMMARY One object of this invention is to provide an improved overtube for use with an irrigation tip of a catheter during a wound irrigation process; and a method for guiding an irrigation tip of a catheter in a wound irrigation process to its intended position for sterilely removing unwanted materials from a body cavity and delivering fluids thereto.

As described above, the tapered frontend of the overtube of the present disclosure may be used to puncture or create an incision on an intended portion of the body, accordingly, in some embodiments, the tapered frontend is designed to equip with blades for such purpose. References are now made to FIGs 3A to 3C, in which an overtube 310 comprising a tubular body 304 and a tapered frontend 302 having at least one blade for making an incision on the intended portion of the body are depicted. FIG 3A is a schematic drawing of the overtube 310, which comprises a tubular body 304 and a tapered frontend 302 having 2 blades (308a, 308b), in which the two blades are respectively disposed along one sides of the frontend 302. Optionally, the tapered frontend 302 may equip with more blades, such as 3 blades (308a, 308b, and 308c) as depicted in FIG 3B; or 4 blades (308a, 308b, 308c, and 308d) arranged in a cross-wise manner as depicted in FIG 3C. FIG 4 illustrates another optional embodiment of the overtube 400 of the present disclosure. In this optional embodiment, the overtube 400 further comprises in its structure, a through-bore 410 disposed at the tip of the tapered frontend 402 and two protruding parts (460a, 460b). The through-bore 410 allows a guide wire to travel there through and thereby helps the user to guide the irrigation tip to its intended position. Preferably, the through-bore 410 has an inner diameter of about 1 to 5 mm, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mm. The two protruding parts (460a, 460b) are disposed on the opposite sides of the outer surface of the rear end of the tubular body 404, and are designed to allow the user a firm grip of the overtube 400. Instead of gripping on the smooth and slippery surface of the overtube 400, the user may hold the overtube 400 respectively at the two protruding parts (460a, 460b) by his/her two fingers. In general, the overtube of the present disclosure is a one-piece article made from a metallic or plastic material. In some embodiments, the overtube is made from a metallic material selected from the group consisting of, stainless steel, titanium, and an alloy comprising titanium, stainless steel or both. In other embodiments, the overtube is made from a plastic material selected from the group consisting of, polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, and high density polyethylene. In one example, the overtube is a one-piece article made from an alloy comprising titanium. In another example, the overtube is a one-piece article made from stainless steel. In still another example, the overtube is a one-piece article made from high density polyethylene. In the case when the overtube is made from a metallic material, it may be re-used after sterilization. In the case when the overtube is made from a plastic material, it may be disposed after each use. A further objective of the present disclosure aims at providing an irrigation assembly 501 for wound irrigation as depicted in FIG 5. The irrigation assembly 501 is composed of an overtube 500, and a bi-lumen tip 550 of an irrigation catheter. The bi-lumen tip 550 may be any bi-lumen tip suitable for irrigation purpose, such as the bi-lumen tip disclosed in WO2012151751, its entire disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. As illustrated in FIG 5, before the irrigation process starts, the bi-lumen tip 550 is assembled with the overtube 500 by inserting the bi-lumen tip 550 into the overtube 500 from the cut away portion 506 of the tubular body 504. Once the bi-lumen tip 550 has been guided and reached its intended position (e.g., the abscess cavity), the assembly is disassembled by pushing the overtube 500 away from the bi-lumen tip 550 and thereby allows the bi-lumen tip 550 to slide out from the cut away portion 506 of the tubular body 504. References are now made to FIGs 6 to 8, which depict a wound irrigation process using the overtube 100 of FIG 1. Before wound irrigation starts, the overtube 100 is first assembled with a bi-lumen tip 150 of an irrigation catheter by inserting the bi-lumen tip 150, which is coupled to an irrigation system (not depicted), into the overtube 100 from the cut away portion 106 of the tubular body 104. Then, while holding the bi-lumen tip 150 at its place, the intended body position for making an incision (indicated as M) was punctured or cut through using the tapered frontend 102 of the overtube 100; the bi-lumen tip 150 is then pushed into the cut tissue (as indicated by T) until it reaches its intended place (indicated as P) (FIG 7). Once the bi-lumen tip 150 is in its place inside the tissue (e.g., abscess cavity), the overtube 100 is pushed away from the bi-lumen tip 550 and thereby allows the bi-lumen tip 150 to slide out from the cut away portion 106 of the tubular body 104. At this stage, the bi-lumen tip 150 would be at its place, and the wound irrigation process may then begin to remove unwanted body debris or fluids from the wound cavity by use of a suction-irrigation system commonly known by any skilled artisan in the related art. The overtube of the present disclosure provides a unique and useful tool for use with irrigation tip of any conventional irrigation system and/or method for conditions where drainage of unwanted materials and delivery of medical fluids are required with a minimum of complications. It will be understood that the above description of embodiments is given by way of example only and that various modifications may be made by those with ordinary skill in the art. For example, the bi-lumen tip having first and second lumens may be tapered toward one end and is bifurcated at the other end, such that the two lumens of the bi-lumen tip share a common lumen wall at the perforated end and remain separated at the bifurcated end. During the suction-irrigation process, the perforated end of the bi-lumen tip is inserted into a body cavity of a patient, whereas the bifurcated end, in which the two lumens remain separated, is coupled to the suction unit and the fluid delivery unit respectively through suitable catheters, and thereby forming an irrigation system for removing unwanted materials from the body cavity and delivering fluids thereto.
