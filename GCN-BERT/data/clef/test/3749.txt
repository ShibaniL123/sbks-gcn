The second step
To a solution of Compound 62 (66.0mg, 0.091mmol) in THF (2mL) was added 1mol / L TBAF THF solution (0.500 mL, 0.500 mmol), and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, water was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane -ethyl acetate and chloroform-methanol) to yield Compound 63 (39.7 mg, yield 78%).
