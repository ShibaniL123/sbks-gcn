DETAILED DESCRIPTION Definition of terms Unless otherwise specified, "a" or "an" means "one or more." As used herein, the term "viral infection" describes a diseased state, in which a virus invades a healthy cell, uses the cell's reproductive machinery to multiply or replicate and ultimately lyse the cell resulting in cell death, release of viral particles and the infection of other cells by the newly produced progeny viruses. Latent infection by certain viruses is also a possible result of viral infection. As used herein, the term "treating or preventing viral infection" means to inhibit the replication of the particular virus, to inhibit viral transmission, or to prevent the virus from establishing itself in its host, and to ameliorate or alleviate the symptoms of the disease caused by the viral infection. The treatment is considered therapeutic if there is a reduction in viral load, decrease in mortality and/or morbidity. IC50 or IC90 (inhibitory concentration 50 or 90) is a concentration of a therapeutic agent, such as an iminosugar, used to achieve 50% or 90% reduction of viral load, respectively. Related Applications The present application refers to by reference in its entirety U.S. provisional application no. 61/202,391 filed February 24, 2009.

In some embodiments, the iminosugar may be a DNJ derivative disclosed in U.S. Patent application publication no. 2007/0275998, which is incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, the deoxynojirimycin derivative may be one of the compounds presented in Figure 1. Methods of synthesizing deoxynojirimycin derivatives are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,622,972, 5,200,523, 5,043,273, 4,994,572, 4,246,345, 4,266,025, 4,405,714, and 4,806,650 and U.S. Patent application publication no. 2007/0275998, which are all incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, the iminosugar may be in a form of a salt derived from an inorganic or organic acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts and methods for preparing salt forms are disclosed, for example, in Berge et al. (J. Pharm. Sci. 66:1-18, 1977). Examples of appropriate salts include but are not limited to the following salts: acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate, cyclopentanepropionate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, palmoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate, mesylate, and undecanoate. In some embodiments, the iminosugar may also used in a form of a prodrug. Prodrugs of DNJ derivatives, such as the 6-phosphorylated DNJ derivatives, are disclosed in U.S. Patents nos. 5,043,273 and 5,103,008. In some embodiments, the iminosugar may be used as a part of a composition, which further comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/ or a component useful for delivering the composition to an animal. Numerous pharmaceutically acceptable carriers useful for delivering the compositions to a human and components useful for delivering the composition to other animals such as cattle are known in the art. Addition of such carriers and components to the composition of the invention is well within the level of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may consist essentially of N-substituted deoxynojirimycin, which may mean that the N-substituted deoxynojirimycin is the only active ingredient in the composition. Yet in some embodiments, N-substituted deoxynojirimycin may be administered with one or more additional antiviral compounds. In some embodiments, the iminosugar may be used in a liposome composition, such as those disclosed in US publication 2008/0138351; US application No. 12/410,750 filed March 25, 2009 and US provisional application No. 61/202,699 filed March 27, 2009. The iminosugar, such as a DNJ derivative, may be administered to a cell or an animal affected by a virus. The iminosugar may inhibit morphogenesis of the virus, or it may treat the individual. The treatment may reduce, abate, or diminish the virus infection in the animal. Animals that may be infected with a virus that belongs to the Arenaviridae family, include vertebrates, such as birds and mammals including primates, humans, rodents and bats. The amount of iminosugar administered to an animal or to an animal cell to the methods of the invention may be an amount effective to inhibit the morphogenesis of a virus belonging to the Arenaviridae family from the cell. The term "inhibit" as used herein may refer to the detectable reduction and/or elimination of a biological activity exhibited in the absence of the iminosugar. The term "effective amount" may refer to that amount of the iminosugar necessary to achieve the indicated effect. The term "treatment" as used herein may refer to reducing or alleviating symptoms in a subject, preventing symptoms from worsening or progressing, inhibition or elimination of the causative agent, or prevention of the infection or disorder related to the virus belonging to the Arenaviridae family in a subject who is free therefrom. Thus, for example, treatment of the disease caused by or associated with a virus may include destruction of the infecting agent, inhibition of or interference with its growth or maturation, and neutralization of its pathological effects. The amount of the iminosugar which may be administered to the cell or animal is preferably an amount that does not induce any toxic effects which outweigh the advantages which accompany its administration. Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions may vary so as to administer an amount of the active compound(s) that is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient. The selected dose level may depend on the activity of the iminosugar, the route of administration, the severity of the condition being treated, and the condition and prior medical history of the patient being treated. However, it is within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound(s) at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. If desired, the effective daily dose may be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration, for example, two to four doses per day. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient may depend on a variety of factors, including the body weight, general health, diet, time and route of administration and combination with other therapeutic agents and the severity of the condition or disease being treated. The adult human daily dosage may range from between about one microgram to about one gram, or from between about 10 mg and 100 mg, of the iminosugar per 10 kilogram body weight. Of course, the amount of the iminosugar which should be administered to a cell or animal may depend upon numerous factors well understood by one of skill in the art, such as the molecular weight of the iminosugar and the route of administration. Pharmaceutical compositions that are useful in the methods of the invention may be administered systemically in oral solid formulations, ophthalmic, suppository, aerosol, topical or other similar formulations. For example, it may be in the physical form of a powder, tablet, capsule, lozenge, gel, solution, suspension, syrup, or the like. In addition to the iminosugar, such pharmaceutical compositions may contain pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers and other ingredients known to enhance and facilitate drug administration. Other possible formulations, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, resealed erythrocytes, and immunologically based systems may also be used to administer the iminosugar. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be administered by a number of routes. The term "parenteral" used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, intrathecal, and injection and infusion techniques, without limitation. By way of example, the pharmaceutical compositions may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, systemically, or by a pulmonary route. These compositions may be administered a in a single dose or in multiple doses which are administered at different times. Because the inhibitory effect of the composition upon a virus belonging to the Arenaviridae family may persist, the dosing regimen may be adjusted such that virus propagation is retarded while the host cell is minimally effected. By way of example, an animal may be administered a dose of the composition of the invention once per week, whereby virus propagation is retarded for the entire week, while host cell functions are inhibited only for a short period once per week.

Effect of iminosugars against Pichinde Virus Figure 5 presents data on the inhibition of Pichinde virus release by the following UV iminosugar compounds: NB-DNJ (UV-1); NN-DNJ (UV-2); N7-O-DNJ (UV-3); N9-DNJ (UV-4); NAP-DNJ (UV-5). Control Vero cell cultures and Vero cell cultures treated with 100µM compounds were infected with virus and cultured for 7 days at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Inhibition of production of infectious virus particles from virus infected cell cultures treated with compounds were determined by plaque assay. The virus plaque assay was performed in Vero cells plated in 6-well plates at 5x105 cells per well in 1x modified Eagle medium (Gibco), supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin. The virus to be titered from collected supernatants from infected cell cultures treated with the compounds were diluted in cell culture medium and inoculated in 100 µl volumes onto cells and allowed to adsorb for 1 hr at 37°C. The cells were overlaid with 0.6% agarose in 1x modified Eagle medium (Gibco), supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Plaques, of dead cells representing individual infectious virus particles that has infected and killed cells, were allowed to develop at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator and visualized by live-staining the cell monolayer with neutral red. The experiment demonstrates that release of infectious Pichinde virus is significantly reduced after treatment with UV iminosugar compounds. 5. Effects of iminosugars against Pichinde and Junin viruses Figure 6 presents data on the inhibition of Pichinde virus and Junin virus releases by the following UV iminosugar compounds: NB-DNJ (UV-1); NN-DNJ (UV-2); N7-O-DNJ (UV-3); N9-DNJ (UV-4); NAP-DNJ (UV-5). Compounds. Base stocks of the following compounds were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to a final maximal DMSO concentration of 0.5%: UV-1, UV-2, UV-3, UV-4, and UV-5. All compounds were diluted from the base stocks to their experimental concentrations. Viruses. The compounds were screened for inhibition against Pichinde Virus (Arenavirus) CoAn 3739 strain, and the Junin (Arenavirus) Candid #1 strain. Viral stocks were made by propagation in Vero cells using modified Eagle medium (MEM, Sigma), supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin and titered using the standard plaque assay (method presented below). Viral stocks were stored at -80°C until used. Virus Yield Reduction Assay. The virus yield assay were performed by standard plaque assay on supernatant samples generated from virus-infected cells incubated with different concentrations of iminosugars. 24-well cell culture plates were seeded with cells in 1mL MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum Vero cells (ATCC, Mannassas, VA; ATCC number CCL-81) in MEM with Earl's salts (Sigma, St Louis, MO) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours or until ~80% confluency. Medium were replaced with medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and the compound concentrations to be used started at 500 µM, 250 µM or 125 µM and tested in triplicate using 8 dilutions. Compounds are added to appropriate wells and incubated for 1hr at 37°C, 5% CO2. After 1hr incubation virus is added to each well. Four days are required for the PICV and five days for JUNV virus infection. Upon completion of infection, supernatant were collected for titering. To titer PICV and JUNV, 12-well plates with 80% confluent Vero cells in growth medium were used.
