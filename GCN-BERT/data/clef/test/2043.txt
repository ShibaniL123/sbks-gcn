Step 10: [1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]-4-fluoropiperidin-4-yl](d2)methanamine
To a solution of 2-aminoethan-1-ol (100 mL) was added 2-([1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]-4-fluoropiperidin-4-yl](2H2)methyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3-dione [Example 2, Step 9] (6.1 g, 14.52 mmol, 1.00 equiv). The resulting solution was stirred for 2 h at 50° C. The reaction mixture was cooled to 25° C. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of water. The resulting solution was extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL). The organic layers were washed with water (3×100 mL) and brine (3×100 mL). The mixture was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum to afford 4 g (95%) of [1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]-4-fluoropiperidin-4-yl](d2)methanamine as yellow oil.
