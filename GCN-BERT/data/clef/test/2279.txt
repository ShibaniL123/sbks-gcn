190.2: 5-bromo-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrimidin-2-one
2.5 mL (5.5 mmol) of a solution of zirconium isopropoxide in heptane of concentration 2M is added to 4.9 g (16.6 mmol) of 5-bromo-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-1H-pyrimidin-2-one in 392 mL of isopropanol. The reaction mixture (white suspension initially) is heated at 90Â° C. for 48 hours. The solvents are concentrated under vacuum. The residue is taken up in dichloromethane and water. The product is extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phases are combined, washed three times with water and then filtered to remove the insolubles (zirconium salts). The filtrate is concentrated under vacuum. The crude product is purified by silica gel chromatography eluted with a heptane/ethyl acetate 50/50 mixture to give 3.45 g (70%) of 5-bromo-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrimidin-2-one in the form of a white solid.
