Step 3: (R)-Methyl 4-(((2-(8-(benzyloxy)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)-2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)methyl)benzoate
A stirred solution of (R)-methyl 4-(((2-(8-(benzyloxy)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)-2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)amino)methyl)benzoate (3.25 g, 5.67 mmol) in DCM (25 mL) was added with a solution of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (1.49 g, 6.83 mmol) in DCM (5 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue purified by flash column chromatography (eluent-100% iso-hexane to 3:2 iso-hexane/ethyl acetate) to afford the title compound (2.84 g, 75%).
