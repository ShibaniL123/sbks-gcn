100.3: 5-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)-3-(2-methoxymethoxyethyl)-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (compound 100)
Similarly to example 13.4, starting from 250 mg (0.7 mmol) of [5-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)-3-(2-methoxymethoxyethyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid and 203 mg (0.8 mmol) of 3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one (prepared as described in example 16.4), and after recrystallization from a heptane/acetone 50/50 mixture; 200 mg (49%) of 5-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)-3-(2-methoxymethoxyethyl)-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a white solid with a melting point of 160Â° C.
