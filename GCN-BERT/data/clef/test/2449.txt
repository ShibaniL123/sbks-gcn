FIELD OF THE INVENTION This present invention is related to the use of thiazole derivatives of Formula (I) for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of autoimmune disorders and/or inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, bacterial or viral infections, allergy, asthma, pancreatitis, multi-organe failure, kidney diseases, platelet aggregation, cancer, sperm motility, graft rejection or lung injuries. Specifically, the present invention is related to thiazole derivatives for the modulation, notably the inhibition of the activity or function of the phosphoinositide-3-kinases, PI3Ks. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) have a critical signalling role in cell proliferation, cell survival, vascularization, membrane trafficking, glucose transport, neurite outgrowth, membrane ruffling, superoxide production, actin reorganization and chemotaxis (Cantley, 2000, Science, 296, 1655-1657 and Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2001, Annu. Rev. Biochem., 70, 535-602). The term PI3K is given to a family of lipid kinases which, in mammals, consists in eight identified PI3Ks that are divided into three sub-families according to their structure and their substrate specificity. Class I group of PI3Ks consists in two sub-groups, Class IA and Class IB. Class IA consists in a 85 kDa regulatory unit (responsible for protein-protein interactions via the interaction of Src homology 2 (SH2) domain with phosphotyrosine residues of other proteins) and a catalytic sub-unit of 110 kDa. Three catalytic forms (p100α, p110β and p110δ) and five regulatory isoforms (p85α, p85γ, p55γ, p55α and p50α) exist for this class. Class IB are stimulated by G protein βγ sub-units of heterodimeric G proteins. The only characterized member of Class IB is PI3Kγ (p110γ catalytic sub-unit complexed with a 101-kDa regulatory protein, p101). Class II PI3Ks comprises α, β and γ isoforms, which are approximately of 170 kDa and characterized by the presence of a C-terminal C2 domain. Class III PI3Ks includes the phosphatidylinositol specific 3-kinases. The evolutionary conserved isoforms p110α and β are ubiquitously expressed, while δ and γ are more specifically expressed in the haematopoetic cell system, smooth muscle cells, myocytes and endothelial cells (Vanhaesebroeck et al., 1997, Trends Biochem Sci., 22(7), 267-72). Their expression might also be regulated in an inducible manner depending on the cellular-, tissue type and stimuli as well as disease context. PI3Ks are enzymes involved in phospholipid signalling and are activated in response to a variety of extra-cellular signals such as growth factors, mitogens, integrins (cell-cell interactions) hormones, cytokines, viruses and neurotransmitters and also by intra-cellular cross regulation by other signaling molecules (cross-talk, where the original signal can activate some parallel pathways that in a second step transmit signals to PI3Ks by intra-cellular signaling events), such as small GTPases, kinases or phosphatases for example. Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) is the basic building block for the intracellular inositol lipids in eukaryotic cells, consisting of D-myo-inositol-1-phosphate (Ins1P) linked via its phosphate group to diacylglycerol. The inositol head group of PtdIns has five free hydroxy groups and three of these are found to be phosphorylated in cells in different combinations. PtdIns and its phosphorylated derivatives are collectively referred as inositol phospholipids or phosphoinositides (PIs). Eight PI species have been documented in eukaryotic cells (Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2001, above). PIs all reside in membranes and are substrates for kinases, phosphatases and lipases. In vitro, PI3Ks phosphorylate the 3-hydroxyl group of the inositol ring in three different substrates: phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), respectively generating three lipid products, namely phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate (PI(3)P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3 (see Scheme A below). The preferred substrate for Class I PI3Ks is PI(4,5)P2. Class II PIKs have a strong preference for PtdIns as substrate over PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2. Class III PI3Ks can only use PtdIns as substrate in vivo and are likely to be responsible for the generation of most PI(3)P in cells (Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2001, above). The phosphoinositides intracellular signalling pathway begins with the binding of a signalling molecule (extracellular ligands, stimuli, receptor dimerization, transactivation by heterologous receptor (e.g. receptor tyrosine kinase)) to a G-protein linked transmembrane receptor integrated into the plasma membrane resulting in the activation of PI3Ks. Once activated, PI3Ks convert the membrane phospholipid PI(4,5)P2 into PI(3,4,5)P3 which in turn can be further converted into another 3′ phosphorylated form of phosphoinositides by 5′-specific phosphoinositide phosphatases, thus PI3K enzymatic activity results either directly or indirectly in the generation of two 3′-phosphoinositide sub-types that function as second messengers in intra-cellular signal transduction (Leslie et al., 2001, Chem. Rev. 101(8) 2365-80; Katso et al., 2001, Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1, 615-75 and Toker et al., 2002, Cell Mol. Life. Sci. 59(5) 761-79). The role as second messengers of phosphorylated products of PtdIns act is involved in a variety of signal transduction pathways, including those essential to cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell growth, cell size, cell survival, apoptosis, adhesion, cell motility, cell migration, chemotaxis, invasion, cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell shape changes, vesicle trafficking and metabolic pathway (Stein, 2000, Mol. Med. Today 6(9) 347-57). Chemotaxis—the directed movement of cells toward a concentration gradient of chemical attractants, also called chemokines is involved in many important diseases such as inflammation/auto-immunity, neurodegeneration, angiogenesis, invasion/metastasis and wound healing (Wyman et al., 2000, Immunol Today 21(6) 260-4; Hirsch et al., 2000, Science 287(5455) 1049-53; Hirsch et al., 2001, FASEB J. 15(11) 2019-21 and Gerard et al., 2001, Nat. Immunol. 2(2) 108-15). PI3-kinase activation, is therefore believed to be involved in a range of cellular responses including cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis (Parker et al., 1995, Current Biology, 5, 577-99; Yao et al., 1995, Science, 267, 2003-05). Recent biochemical studies revealed that, Class I PI3Ks (e.g. Class IB isoform PI3Kγ) are dual-specific kinase enzymes, i.e. they display both lipid kinase activity (phosphorylation of phospho-inositides) as well as protein kinase activity, as they are able to induce the phosphorylation of other protein as substrates, including auto-phosphorylation as intra-molecular regulatory mechanism. PI3Ks appear to be involved in a number of aspects of leukocyte activation. A p85-associated PI3-kinase activity has been shown to physically associate with the cytoplasmic domain of CD28, which is an important co-stimulatory molecule for the activation of T-cells in response to antigen (Pages et al., 1994, Nature, 369, 327-29). These effects are linked to increases in the transcription of a number of genes including interleukin-2 (IL2), an important T cell growth factor (Fraser et al., 1991, Science, 251, 313-16). Mutation of CD28 such that it can longer interact with PI3-kinase leads to a failure to initiate IL2 production, suggesting a critical role for PI3-kinase in T cell activation. Cellular processes in which PI3Ks play an essential role include suppression of apoptosis, reorganization of the actin skeleton, cardiac myocyte growth, glycogen synthase stimulation by insulin, TNFα-mediated neutrophil priming and superoxide generation, and leukocyte migration and adhesion to endothelial cells. PI3Kγ has been identified as a mediator of G beta-gamma-dependent regulation of JNK activity wherein G beta-gamma are subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Lopez-Ilasaca et al., 1998, J. Biol. Chem. 273(5) 2505-8). Recently, it has been described that PI3Kγ relays inflammatory signals through various G(i)-coupled receptors (Laffargue et al., 2002, Immunity 16(3) 441-51) and its central to mast cell function, stimuli in context of leukocytes, immunology includes cytokines, chemokines, adenosines, antibodies, integrins, aggregation factors, growth factors, viruses or hormones for example (Lawlor et al., 2001, J. Cell. Sci., 114 (Pt 16) 2903-1 and Stephens et al., 2002, Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 14(2), 203-13). Specific inhibitors against individual members of a family of enzymes provide valuable tools for deciphering functions of each enzyme. Two compounds, LY294002 and wortmannin (cf. hereinafter), have been widely used as PI3-kinase inhibitors. These compounds are non-specific PI3K inhibitors, as they do not distinguish among the four members of Class I PI3-kinases. IC50 values of wortmannin against each of the various Class I PI3-kinases are in the range of 1-10 nM and IC50 values for LY294002 against each of these PI3-kinases are about 15-20 μM (Fruman et al., 1998, Ann. Rev. Biochem., 67, 481-507), also 5-10 mM on CK2 protein kinase and some inhibitory activity on phospholipases. Wortmannin is a fungal metabolite which irreversibly inhibits PI3K activity by binding covalently to the catalytic domain of this enzyme. Inhibition of PI3K activity by wortmannin eliminates the subsequent cellular response to the extracellular factor (Thelen et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91, 4960-64). Experiments with wortmannin, show that PI3K activity in cells of hematopoietic lineage, particularly neutrophils, monocytes, and other types of leukocytes, is involved in many of the non-memory immune response associated with acute and chronic inflammation. Based on studies using wortmannin, there is evidence that PI3-kinase function is also required for some aspects of leukocyte signaling through G-protein coupled receptors (Thelen et al., 1994). Moreover, it has been shown that wortmannin and LY294002 block neutrophil migration and superoxide release. However, in as much as these compounds do not distinguish among the various isoforms of PI3K, it remains unclear which particular PI3K isoform or isoforms are involved in these phenomena. Some results have indicated that PI3K inhibitors, for example, LY294002, can increase the in vivo antitumor activity of certain cytotoxic agents (e.g. paclitaxel) (Grant, 2003, Current Drugs, 6(10), 946-948). Recently, 5-phenylthiazole derivatives have been recently developed as PI3K inhibitors (WO 03/072557). The high relevance of the PI3K pathway in some widely spread diseases stresses the need to develop inhibitors, including selective inhibitors, of PIKs.

Especially preferred salts are sodium and potassium salts. “Pharmaceutically acceptable salts or complexes” refer to salts or complexes of the below-identified compounds of Formula (I) that retain the desired biological activity. Examples of such salts include, but are not restricted to acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and the like), and salts formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic acid, pamoic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalene sulfonic acid, naphthalene disulfonic acid, and poly-galacturonic acid.

It has now been found that compounds of the present invention are modulators of the Phosphatoinositides 3-kinases (PI3Ks). When the phosphatoinositides 3-kinase (PI3K) enzyme is inhibited by the compounds of the present invention, PI3K is unable to exert its enzymatic, biological and/or pharmacological effects. The compounds of the present invention are therefore useful in the treatment and prevention of autoimmune disorders and/or inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, bacterial or viral infections, kidney diseases, platelet aggregation, cancer, transplantation, graft rejection or lung injuries. General Formula (I) according to the present invention also comprises its tautomers, its geometrical isomers, its optically active forms as enantiomers, diastereomers and its racemate forms, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the Formula (I) are acid addition salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable acids like hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate or bisulfate, phosphate or hydrogen phosphate, acetate, benzoate, succinate, fumarate, maleate, lactate, citrate, tartrate, gluconate, methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, and para-toluenesulfonate salts. The compounds according to Formula (I) are suitable for the modulation, notably the inhibition of the activity of phosphatoinositides 3-kinases (PI3K). It is therefore believed that the compounds of the present invention are also particularly useful for the treatment and/or prevention of disorders which are mediated by PI3Ks, particularly PI3Kγ. Said treatment involves the modulation—notably the inhibition or the down regulation—of the phosphatoinositides 3-kinases. The compounds according to Formula (I) are suitable for use as a medicament.

The thiazole derivatives exemplified in this invention may be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred experimental conditions (i.e. reaction temperatures, time, moles of reagents, solvents etc.) are given, other experimental conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvents used, but such conditions can be determined by the person skilled in the art, using routine optimisation procedures. Synthesis of Compounds of the Invention: The novel bis-thiazole or oxazole-thiazole derivatives according to Formula (I) can be prepared from readily available starting materials by several synthetic approaches, using both solution-phase and solid-phase chemistry protocols (Pirrung et al., J. Comb. Chem. 2001, 3, 90-96). Examples of synthetic pathways for the will be described. The following abbreviations refer respectively to the definitions below: min (minute), hr (hour), g (gram), MHz (Megahertz), ml (milliliter), mmol (millimole), mM (millimolar), rt (room temperature), ATP (Adenoside Triphosphate), BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin), CDI (N,N′-carbonyldiimidazole), DCM (dichloromethane), DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide), DIEA (di-isopropyl ethylamine), DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide), EDC (1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl-carbodiimide hydro-chloride), HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography), Ins1P (D-myo-inositol-1-phosphate), mCPBA (m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid), MS (mass spectrometry), NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline), PIs (Phosphoinositides), PI3Ks (Phosphoinositide 3-kinases), PI(3)P (Phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate), PI(3,4)P2 (Phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate), PI(3,4,5)P3 (Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-tri-phosphate), PI(4)P (Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate), PI(4,5)P2) (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate), PtdIns (Phosphatidylinositol), SPA (Scintillation Proximity Assay), TEA (triethylamine), THF (tetrahydrofuran), TLC (Thin Layer Chromatography), UV (Ultraviolet). One synthetic approach (Scheme 1 below) consists in reacting approximately equimolar amounts of an α-bromoketone reactant (P1) with a thiourea, a dithiocarbamate or a dithiocarbamic acid alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl ester (P2), mixed in a solvent, preferably 1 to polar such as alcoholic solvent, to afford a compound of Formula (I). The temperature of the reaction depends on the nature of (P1) and (P2), ranging between −20° C. and reflux. Another synthetic approach, described on Scheme 2 below, consists in reacting in the same way a free amine derivative (P1a), with a thiourea or a dithiocarbamate (P2), affording the corresponding bis-thiazole or oxazole-thiazole of Formula (Ia). Derivative (Ia) can be further substituted by a group —C(O)R4 to lead to a compound of Formula (I) using conditions known by the person skilled in the art. When the group —C(O)R4 is an acyl group, the corresponding acyl chloride is added to intermediate (Ia) in the presence of a base, e.g. pyridine, DIEA, TEA, etc. The corresponding carboxylic acid can be also added in the presence of an activating agent such as DCC, EDC, etc. A formyl group, i.e. —C(O)R4=—C(O)H, can be introduced by heating intermediate (Ia) in formic acid or in any alkyl formate, with or without a cosolvent. A substituted urea is formed by addition of an isocyanate, R8R9NC(O), to intermediate (Ia) in the presence of a base, e.g. DIEA, TEA, etc. The sequential addition of CDI and ammonia to intermediate (Ia) affords a compound of Formula (I) with —C(O)R4=—C(O)NH2. Other —C(O)R4 functionalities can be added to intermediate (Ia), to give a compound of Formula (I) as defined above in the description, using reaction conditions known to the person skilled in the art. In the case of compounds of the invention of Formula (I) wherein R1=NR5R6, i.e. of Formula (Ib), the same processes as described above may be used and wherein derivatives of formula (P2) are thiourea of formula (P2a) (Scheme 3 below). For the preparation of compounds of Formula (Ib), approximately equimolar amounts of the α-bromoketone reactant (P1) and N-substituted thiourea (P2a) are stirred as a solution or a suspension in a solvent, preferably polar such as alcoholic solvent. When reagents (P1) or (P2a) are used as salt, an excess of base, preferably triethylamine or pyridine (about 3 equivalents), is added to the reaction mixture. The temperature chosen for this reaction depends on the nature of (P1) and (P2a), varying between −20° C. and reflux. The desired bis-thiazole or oxazole-thiazole of Formula (Ib) is then isolated as HBr salt by filtration, in case it precipitates out of the reaction mixture upon cooling, or by evaporation of the solvents to obtain the crude product. This crude product can be then purified, if desired, e.g. by crystallization or by standard chromatographic methods. When R5 and R6 form a ring, the same processes as described above may be used. Alternatively the HBr liberated during the reaction can be first neutralized by addition of an excess of base, preferably triethylamine or pyridine (about 3 equivalents). The desired bis-thiazole or oxazole-thiazole of Formula (Ib) is then isolated by filtration, in case it precipitates out of the reaction mixture upon cooling, and washed with water to remove the HBr salt of the base added. It can also be precipitated by addition of water and isolated by filtration or be extracted with an organic solvents, such as EtOAc or DCM. The resulting crude product can be then purified, if desired, e.g. by crystallization or by standard chromatographic methods. These reaction conditions described above and detailed in the Examples below can be also applied on when using compounds (P1a) as starting material. In this case, compounds of Formula (Ib) can be then obtained with an additional step for the introduction of the group —C(O)R4, as defined above in the description, using conditions known to the person skilled in the art. When —C(O)R4 is an acyl group, the corresponding acyl chloride is added to intermediate (Ia), wherein R1=NR5R6, in the presence of a base, e.g. pyridine, DIEA, TEA, etc. The corresponding carboxylic acid can also be added in the presence of an activating agent such as DCC, EDC, etc. A formyl group, i.e. —C(O)R4=—C(O)H, can be introduced by heating (Ia), wherein R1=NR5R6, in formic acid or in any alkyl formate with or without a cosolvent. A substituted urea is formed by addition of an isocyanate, R8R9NC(O), to intermediate (Ia), wherein R1=NR5R6, in the presence of a base, e.g. DIEA, TEA, etc. The sequential addition of CDI and ammonia to intermediate (Ia), wherein R1=NR5R6, affords compound of the invention according to Formula (Ib) with —C(O)R4=—C(O)NH2. Other —C(O)R4 functionalities can be added to intermediate (Ia), wherein R1=NR5R6, to give a compound of the invention according to Formula (Ib) as defined above in the description, using reaction conditions known to the person skilled in the art. Thioureas (P2a) used in synthetic Scheme 3 above are either commercially available from various sources or synthesized using conditions known to the person skilled in the art. For example, thioureas (P2a) can be obtained by coupling a salt of an amine NHR5R6, preferably HCl salt, with potassium thiocyanate used in equimolarity in THF under reflux (Herr et al., J. Synthesis, 2000, 1569-1574) as shown on Scheme 4 below, Pathway A. The amine NHR5R6 can be first activated with ethoxycarbonyl isothiocyanate affording an ethoxycarbonyl thiourea intermediate, as presented above on Scheme 4, Pathway B (Hartmann et al., Prakt. Chem. 1973, 315, 144-148). Upon deprotection under acidic conditions, e.g. concentrated HCl, the desired thiourea (P2a) is released. The amine NHR5R6 can be also activated with benzoyl isothiocyanate, obtained by addition of benzoyl chloride to ammonium thiocyanate, giving a benzoyl thiourea intermediate, as shown above on Scheme 4, Pathway C (Rasmussen et al., Synthesis, 1988, 456-459). Upon deprotection under basic conditions, e.g. NaOH, the desired thiourea (P2a) is released. Alternatively, the amine NHR5R6 can be reacted with thiophogene, followed by the addition of ammonia, as presented above on Scheme 4, Pathway D (Wilson et al., J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001, 11, 915-918; Feldman et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1991, 32, 875). If the above set of synthetic methods are not applicable to obtain N-substituted thiourea (P2a), suitable methods of preparation known by a person skilled in the art should be used. The amine NHR5R6 used in synthetic Scheme 4 above are either commercially available from various sources or synthesized, as it will be detailed below in the examples, using conditions known to the person skilled in the art. The thioureas (P2a) synthesized under conditions described in pathways A, B, C and D, or any other method reported in the literature, are either used directly in the synthesis of bis-thiazole or oxazole-thiazole of Formula (I) or first purified, if desired, e.g. by crystallization or by standard chromatographic methods. Bis-thiazole or oxazole-thiazole derivatives of the invention according to Formula (I) wherein R1 is SO2R7, i.e. compounds of Formula (Ic), can be obtained by several to synthetic approaches. An example of such a process is described hereinafter. Bis-thiazole or oxazole-thiazole derivatives of the invention according to Formula (I) wherein R1 is SO2R7, i.e. compounds of Formula (Ic) and wherein R7 is selected from optionally substituted C1-C6-alkyl, optionally substituted C2-C6-alkenyl and optionally substituted—alkynyl can be obtained by the oxidation of the corresponding alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl sulfur (P3) as shown below on Scheme 5 below. Oxidative agents used in this transformation can be selected from m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, mCPBA, (Alvarez-Ibarra et al., Heterocycles 1991, 32, 2127-2137), KMnO4 (Konno et al., Yakugaku 1990, 110, 105-114), H2O2(Fukatsu et al., Heterocycles, 1989, 29, 1517-1528) and any other oxidative agents known by the person skilled in the art. The oxidation reaction can also be performed on the free amine (P3a) to lead to the corresponding bis-thiazole or oxazole-thiazole intermediate (Id) that can be further substituted by a group —C(O)R4 into a compound of the invention of Formula (Ic), using conditions known to the person skilled in the art. When —C(O)R4 is an acyl group, the corresponding acyl chloride is added to intermediate (Id) in the presence of a base, e.g. pyridine, DIEA, TEA, etc. The corresponding carboxylic acid can be also added in the presence of an activating agent such as DCC, EDC, etc. A formyl group, —C(O)R4=—C(O)H, can be introduced by heating intermediate (Id) in formic acid or in any alkyl formate, with or without a cosolvent. A substituted urea is formed by addition of an isocyanate, R8R9NC(O), to intermediate (Id) in the presence of a base, e.g. DIEA, TEA, etc. The sequential addition of CDI and ammonia to intermediate (Id) affords a compound of the invention of Formula (Ic) with —C(O)R4=—C(O)NH2. Other —C(O)R functionalities can be added to intermediate (Id), to lead to a compound of the invention according to Formula (Ic) as defined above in the description, using reaction conditions known to the person skilled in the art. Bis-thiazole or oxazole-thiazole derivatives of the invention according to Formula (I) wherein R1 is —SO2NR10R11, i.e. compounds of Formula (Ie) can be obtained in two steps, starting with an oxidative chlorination step with Cl2 for the transformation of a sulfure derivative (P4) into the corresponding sulfonyl chloride (P6) as shown on Scheme 6 below. The second step is the addition of a suitable amine HNR10R11 to the sulfonyl chloride (P6) in the presence of a base, e.g. DIEA, TEA, pyridine, etc, affording sulfonamide derivatives of the invention according to Formula (Ie), as shown on Scheme 6 below. When R10 and R11 form a ring, the same processes as described above may be used. The oxidative chlorination step can be replaced by a two steps process, involving the oxydation of a sulfure (P4) into the corresponding sulfonic acid (P5) (Mazzone et al. Il Farmaco Ed Sc. 1980, 36, 181-196), followed by its chlorination into a sulfonyl chloride (P6). Different chlorination reagents can be used, as for example PCl5, POCl3 or SOCl2 (Chan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998, 6, 2301-2316; Kropf et al., J. Chem. Eng. Data 1988, 33, 537-538; El-Maghraby et al., Indian Journal of Chemistry, Section B: Organic Chemistry Including Medicinal Chemistry 1981, 20B, 256-257). Methods of Preparing Intermediates of Compounds of Formula (I). Intermediates (P3) and (P4) are obtained by the reaction of approximately equimolar amounts of the α-bromoketone (P1) with Ammonium dithiocarbamate (P2b) or dithiocarbamic acid alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl ester (P2c) respectively as shown below on Scheme 7 below. The mixture is stirred as a suspension or solution in a polar solvent, preferably an alcoholic solvent, at a temperature depending on the nature of (P1), (P2b) and (P2c) (Pattan et al., J. Indian Drugs 2002, 429-433). The desired bis-thiazole or oxazole-thiazole of formula (P3) or (P4) respectively is isolated by filtration, in case it precipitated out of the reaction mixture upon cooling, or by evaporation of the solvents to obtain the crude product. This crude product can be purified, if desired, e.g. by crystallization or by standard chromatographic methods. Compound (P3) can be also obtained by direct alkylation of (P4) with R7Hal (where Hal is any leaving group such halides (e.g. Cl, Br, I), alkyl sulfonyloxy or aryl sulfonyloxy groups (e.g. tosyloxy group) in the presence of a base, e.g. MeI or any other alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl halide, alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl sulfonyloxy alkyl or aryl in the presence of NaOH (Nair et al., J. Org. Chem. 1975, 40, 1348-1349). Ammonium dithiocarbamate (P2b) can be obtained by addition of ammonia to a carbon disulfide solution in a solvent such as THF as shown on Scheme 8 below. It can be further transformed into (P2c) using R7Hal, e.g. dimethyl sulfate (Brandsma et al., Synthesis 1985, 948-949). α-bromoketone (P1) can be obtained in two steps, from substituted 5-acetyl-2-amino thiazole (P5) as shown on Scheme 9 below. Functionalization of the primary amine in (P5) with a group —C(O)R4 as defined above in the description can be performed first, using conditions known to the person skilled in the art to afford (P6). When —C(O)R is an acyl group, the corresponding acyl chloride is added to (P5) in the presence of a base, e.g. pyridine, DIEA, TEA, etc. The corresponding carboxylic acid can be also added in the presence of an activating agent such as DCC, EDC, etc. A formyl group, —C(O)R4=—C(O)H, can be introduced by heating (P5) in formic acid or in any alkyl formate, with or without a cosolvent. A substituted urea is formed by addition of an isocyanate, R8R9NC(O), to intermediate (P5) in the presence of a base, e.g. DIEA, TEA, etc. The sequential addition of CDI and ammonia to (P5) affords (P6) with —C(O)R4=—C(O)NH2. Other —C(O)R4 functionalities can be added to intermediate (P5), to give an intermediate of formula (P6) as defined above in the description, using reaction conditions known to the person skilled in the art. This step is then followed by a α-bromination of the 5-acetyl group to afford intermediate (P1). These two steps can be done in the reverse order, performing first the bromination on intermediate (P5) in the presence of the unprotected primary amine, affording an intermediate (P1a), and then the introduction of —C(O)R4 group as defined above in the description using conditions known to the person skilled in the art to afford an intermediate (P1). In both synthetic pathways, different bromination agents can be used, such as Br2 (Bhatti et al., Indian J Heterocyclic Chem. 2000, 10, 81-84), in the optional presence of HBr (Lipinski et al., J. Med. Chem. 1986, 29, 2154-2163), NBS (Sayed et al., Heteroatom Chemistry 1999, 10, 385-390). Intermediates according to formula (P5) are either commercially available from various sources or can be obtained by several synthetic approaches, using both solution-phase and solid-phase chemistry protocols (Kodomari et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 2002, 43, 1717-1720). An example of a synthetic approach for obtaining intermediate (P5) is illustrated on Scheme 10 hereinafter. A substituted bi-ketone (P7) is halogenated, using for example Br2 for a bromination or thionyl chloride for a chlorination, affording an intermediate (P8). “Hal” in intermediate (P8) can be as well a tosyloxy group, which is introduced with suitable reagents such as hydroxy(tosyloxy)iodobenzene. Intermediate (P8) is then added to a solution of thiourea or urea in a suitable solvent, preferably a polar solvent, e.g. EtOH to lead to an intermediate (P5). The specific reaction conditions, temperature, time, etc, depend on the nature of X and substituents R2 and R3, according to the literature and as it will be detailed below in the examples (Sayed et al., 1999, above; Dahiya et al., Indian J. Chem. 1986, 25B, 966; Lipinski et al., J. Org. Chem. 1984, 49, 566-570; WO95/01979; EP0117082; JP11209284; Öhler et al., Chem. Ber. 1985, 118, 4099-4130). Intermediate (P6) can be directly obtained from the reaction of (P8) with the suitable thiourea or urea (P9), substituted with a —C(O)R4 group as it has been defined above in the description. Thiourea or urea (P9) are either commercially available or obtained by functionalization of urea H2NC(O)NH2 or thiourea H2NC(S)NH2 with —C(O)R4, as defined above in the description, using conditions known to the person skilled in the art. When R3=H, P7a is prepared in one step, as sodium salt, by the condensation of a methyl ketone with ethyl formate, as described on Scheme 11 below. It is then directly brominated, affording intermediate P8a, according to the literature and as it will be detailed below in the examples (Lipinski et al., J. Org. Chem. 1984, 49, 566-570). According to a further general process, compounds of Formula (I) can be converted to alter-native compounds of Formula (I), employing suitable interconversion techniques well known by a person skilled in the art. If the above set of general synthetic methods are not applicable to obtain compounds according to Formula (I) and/or necessary intermediates for the synthesis of compounds of Formula (I), suitable methods of preparation known by a person skilled in the art should be used. In general, the synthesis pathways for any individual compound of Formula (I) will depend on the specific substitutents of each molecule and upon the ready availability of intermediates necessary; again such factors being appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. For all the protection and deprotection methods, see Philip J. Kocienski, in “Protecting Groups”, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York, 1994 and, Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, Wiley Interscience, 3rd Edition 1999. Compounds of this invention can be isolated in association with solvent molecules by crystallization from evaporation of an appropriate solvent. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of Formula (I), which contain a basic center, may be prepared in a conventional manner. For example, a solution of the free base may be treated with a suitable acid, either neat or in a suitable solution, and the resulting salt isolated either by filtration or by evaporation under vacuum of the reaction solvent. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts may be obtained in an analogous manner by treating a solution of compound of Formula (I) with a suitable base. Both types of salts may be formed or interconverted using ion-exchange resin techniques. When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the present invention are typically administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Hence, pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient therefore are also within the scope of the present invention. A person skilled in the art is aware of a whole variety of such carrier, diluent or excipient compounds suitable to formulate a pharmaceutical composition. The compounds of the invention, together with a conventionally employed adjuvant, carrier, diluent or excipient may be placed into the form of pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosages thereof, and in such form may be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, or liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, or capsules filled with the same, all for oral use, or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for parenteral (including subcutaneous use). Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be employed. Pharmaceutical compositions containing thiazole derivatives of this invention can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active compound. Generally, the compounds of this invention are administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. The amount of the compound actually administered will typically be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular and intranasal. The compositions for oral administration can take the form of bulk liquid solutions or suspensions, or bulk powders. More commonly, however, the compositions are presented in unit dosage forms to facilitate accurate dosing. The term “unit dosage forms” refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Typical unit dosage forms include prefilled, premeasured ampoules or syringes of the liquid compositions or pills, tablets, capsules or the like in the case of solid compositions. In such compositions, the thiazole derivative is usually a minor component (from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight or preferably from about 1 to about 40% by weight) with the remainder being various vehicles or carriers and processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form. Liquid forms suitable for oral administration may include a suitable aqueous or nonaqueous vehicle with buffers, suspending and dispensing agents, colorants, flavors and the like. Solid forms may include, for example, any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatine; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as pepper-mint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. Injectable compositions are typically based upon injectable sterile saline or phosphate-buffered saline or other injectable carriers known in the art. As above mentioned, the bis-thoiazole derivatives derivatives of Formula (I) in such compositions is typically a minor component, frequently ranging between 0.05 to 10% by weight with the remainder being the injectable carrier and the like. The above described components for orally administered or injectable compositions are merely representative. Further materials as well as processing techniques and the like are set out in Part 5 of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th Edition, 2000, Marck Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., which is incorporated herein by reference. The compounds of this invention can also be administered in sustained release forms or from sustained release drug delivery systems. A description of representative sustained release materials can also be found in the incorporated materials in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. In the following the present invention shall be illustrated by means of some examples, which are not construed to be viewed as limiting the scope of the invention.

Intermediate 1: Preparation of N-[5-(bromoacetyl)-4-methyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]acetamide, hydrobromide salt (Intermediate (P1) wherein R2 is H, R3 and R4 are methyl and X is S). Step I: N-(5-acetyl-4-methyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)acetamide (Intermediate (P6) wherein R2 is H, R3 and R4 are methyl and X is S) 5-Acetyl-2-amino-4-methylthiazole (P5) (12.35 g, 79 mmol) is suspended in THF/DCM 3:2 mixture (150 mL). The mixture was cooled down to 0° C. and pyridine (16 mL) is added, followed by the dropwise addition of acetyl chloride (8.43 mL, 119 mmol, 1.5 eq). The mixture was stirred 2 hours at 0° C. As the acetylation is complete, the reaction is quenched with addition of water (70 mL) and diluted with EtOAc (100 mL). The two phases are separated and the organic phase is washed with one portion of 10% citric acid solution. Organic layer is dried over MgSO4, filtrated and evaporated. The resulting crude mass is purified by crystallization in EtOAc/Cyclohexane mixture, to obtain N-(5-acetyl-4-methyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)acetamide (P6) as a colorless powder (13.13 g, 83.6% yield). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) δ: 2.17 (s, 3H), 2.47 (s, 3H), 2.56 (s, 3H), 12.44 (br s, 1H).

The resulting mixture is heated at 50° C. for 19 hours. The solution turns from dark red to beige and remains a heterogeneous mixture. By analytical HPLC, only 2.8% of starting material is detected. The suspension is filtered, washed with a 1:2 EtOAc/hexanes mixture (50 mL) and air dried for 15 min, to give Intermediate 1 as a beige solid (11.2 g, 60%). It is used in bis-thiazol synthesis as HBr salt or as parent, after 5 min treatment with Amberlyst A21 in DCM/MeOH mixture. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) δ: 2.04 (s, 3H), 2.44 (s, 3H), 4.52 (s, 2H), 12.44 (br s, 1H).

The assay combines the scintillation proximity assay technology (SPA, Amersham) with the capacity of neomycin (a polycationic antibiotic) to bind phospholipids with high affinity and specificity. The Scintillation Proximity Assay is based on the properties of weakly emitting isotopes (such as 3H, 125I, 33P). Coating SPA beads with neomycin allows the detection of phosphorylated lipid substrates after incubation with recombinant PI3K and radioactive ATP in the same well, by capturing the radioactive phospholipids to the SPA beads through their specific binding to neomycin. To a 384 wells MTP containing 5 μl of the test compound of Formula (I) (solubilized in 6% DMSO; to yield a concentration of 100, 30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.001 μM of the test compound), the following assay components are added. 1) 5 μl (58 ng) of Human recombinant GST-PI3Kγ (in Hepes 40 mM, pH 7.4, DTT 1 mM and ethylenglycol 5%) 2) 10 μl of lipid micelles and 3) 10 μl of Kinase buffer ([33P]γ-ATP 45 μM/60 nCi, MgCl230 mM, DTT 1 mM, β-Glycerophosphate 1 mM, Na3VO4 100 μM, Na Cholate 0.3%, in Hepes 40 mM, pH 7.4). After incubation at room temperature for 180 minutes, with gentle agitation, the reaction is stopped by addition of 60 μl of a solution containing 100 μg of neomycin-coated PVT SPA beads in PBS containing ATP 10 mM and EDTA 5 mM. The assay is further incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes with gentle agitation to allow binding of phospholipids to neomycin-SPA beads. After precipitation of the neomycin-coated PVT SPA beads for 5 minutes at 1500×g, radioactive PtdIns(3)P is quantified by scintillation counting in a Wallac MicroBeta™ plate counter. The values indicated in Table I below refer to the IC50 (nM) with respect to PI3Kγ, i.e. the amount necessary to achieve 50% inhibition of said target.

Previous to the stimulation with 50 nM of Complement 5a during 5 minutes, Cells are serum starved for 2 h, and pretreated with inhibitors for 20 minutes. After stimulation cells are fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 20 minutes and washed 3 times in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (PBS/Triton). Endogenous peroxidase is blocked by a 20 minutes incubation in 0.6% H2O2 and 0.1% Sodium Azide in PBS/Triton and washed 3 times in PBS/Triton. Cells are then blocked by 60 minutes incubation with 10% fetal calf serum in PBS/Triton. Next, phosphorylated Akt/PKB is detected by an overnight incubation at 4° C. with first antibody (anti phospho Serine 473 Akt IHC, Cell Signaling) diluted 800-fold in PBS/Triton, containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After 3 washes in PBS/Triton, cells are incubated for 60 minutes with a peroxidase conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (1/400 dilution in PBS/Triton, containing 5% BSA), washed 3 times in PBS/Triton, and 2 times in PBS and further incubated in 100 μl of substrate reagent solution (R&D) for 20 minutes. The reaction is stopped by addition of 50 μl of 1 M SO4H2 and absorbance is read at 450 nm.
