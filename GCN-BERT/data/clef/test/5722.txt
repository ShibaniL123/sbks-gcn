APPLICANT: Invention Title: AUSTRALIA Patents Act 1990 Complete Specification Standard Patent Stryker Trauma SA FIXATION CLAMP Regulation 3.2 The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method of performing it known to me: TITLE Fixation Clamp TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a fixation clamp and, more particularly, to a fixation clamp for use in an external fixation system for holding bone fragments adjacent to each other. PRIOR ART External fixation systems are widely used to connect two or more bone fragments to each other. Such systems comprise bone screws, pins, wires which are inserted directly into the bone material and these systems use external structural elements as fixation rods, bars and rings. In order to connect the rods and bars to form a rigid frame, fixation clamps are used. Furthermore, fixation clamps are used to connect this screws and pins to the rigid frame to specifically hold bone fragments at an intended place. One adjustable fixation clamp is known from ΕΡ 0 700 664 comprising two pairs of jaws allowing clamping of a rod as well as of a pin. A clamp for multiple rod-shaped elements is known from ΕΡ 1 627 609 having one single pair of jaws. However, such a clamp allows clamping more than two, e.g. three or four rod-shaped elements as pins with one single clamp, thus reducing the number of clamps. However, one further fixation clamp is necessary to fix the rod of said clamp to the frame of the fixation system. WO 2007/001945 mentions that usual fixation clamps as e.g. known from ΕΡ 0 700 664 allow clamping of one single screw or pin to the frame and that this way to attach pins or rods leads to bulky fixation systems. Therefore WO 2007/001945 discloses a fixation clamp addressing this problem and comprises two pairs of jaws within which each pair of jaws allows the introduction and clamping of two rods or pins etc. at the same time. These clamps according to the prior art either provide different diameters of the receptions provided by the jaws to introduce different sizes of rods, pins or wires, or they rely on additional inserts as e.g. disclosed in ΕΡ 1 661 523. Such inserts reduce the diameter of the reception cavities to allow a secure fixing of differently sized rods, pins or wires. From ΕΡ 2 250 968 a further fixation clamp is known. Users feel very comfortable with the fixation clamp according to ΕΡ 2 250 968. However, there is a need to have a fixation clamp which can be cleaned more easily and which can also compensate angular orientation between the rods or pins during the mounting process. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a fixation clamp which overcomes the disadvantages of prior art. It is in particular an object of the present invention to provide a fixation clamp which is adjustable during the mounting process to a larger degree. Such an object is solved by the features of claim 1. Therefore a fixation clamp, more particularly for use in an external fixation system for holding bone fragments adjacent to each other with the help of fixation elements, comprises at least one clamping assembly having at least one reception to accommodate a fixation element along the longitudinal axis of the reception and at least one locking element extending through the clamping assemblies for blocking the position of the clamping assemblies in a defined angular position, wherein between said locking element and said at least one clamping assembly there is arranged a washer. The clamping assembly comprises a first contact surface which is at least partly spherical and convex and in that said washer comprises a second contact surface which is at least partly spherical and concave, wherein the first contact surface is in contact with the second contact surface. Due to the arrangement of the spherical concave and convex surface it is possible to provide the fixation clamp with better adjustment properties. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a fixation clamp which is dismountable for cleaning purposes in a very easy manner. This object is achieved by said washer which is dismountable in a direction substantially perpendicular to said locking element. In particular it shall be prevented that the fixation clamp has to be dismounted in a complicated manner and/or that all of the parts of the fixation clamps have to be separated. This object is achieved by an abutment surface. The bore comprises towards the contact surface preferably a first diameter which is adjoined by a second diameter, wherein the first diameter is larger than the second diameter such that between the first and the second diameter an abutment surface is provided, which abutment surface serves as abutment element for the locking element, in particular for flange, in case the washer is removed. Further embodiments of the invention are laid down in the dependent claims. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Preferred embodiments of the invention are described in the following with reference to the drawings, which are for the purpose of illustrating the present preferred embodiments of the invention and not for the purpose of limiting the same. In the drawings, Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of a first embodiment of a fixation clamp of the present invention; Fig. 2 shows a cross-section of the fixation clamp according to figure 1 ; Fig. 3 shows a top view of the fixation clamp for figure 1 ; Fig. 4 shows a perspective view of a washer that is used in the fixation clamp of figure 1. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Figure 1 und 2 show a preferred first embodiment of a clamping element or fixation clamp 10 pursuant to the invention. The clamping element 10 consists of a first clamping assembly 20 and a second clamping assembly 30 and a locking element or shaft 40 which is positioned through bores 21, 31 within the two clamp assemblies 20, 30 along the longitudinal axis Μ of shaft 40. The shaft 40 is preferably a locking element adapted to allow closing the clamp assemblies 20 and 30. Shaft 40 enters a first jaw 11 through a washer 41. The shaft 40 comprises a head portion 44, a reduced diameter portion 43 which is followed by a shaft portion 42 and a thread portion 49. The outer threaded portion 49 is adapted to be screwed into a complementary inner thread within the distal jaw 11 so that turning the head of the shaft 40 changes the longitudinal position of the shaft 40 against the lower jaw 11, which allows opening or closing the entire clamp 10 against the force of a spring 15 provided between the two clamp assemblies 20 and 30. Said spring 15 is preferably positioned in corresponding receptions 16 in the jaws 12. Instead of a spring 15, provided around shaft 40, it is possible to provide a different spring means as Belleville washers or an elastic compressible solid or foam. Upon closing of the clamp assemblies 20 and 30 the jaws 12 adjacent to the spring 15 can eventually come into contact and then the anti-rotation surfaced 55 which are provided in both surfaces of the jaws 12 fixe the angular orientation of each clamping assembly 20 and 30 against the other. Preferably after having mounted the shaft 40 with the thread 49 within the lower jaw 11, the end portion of the thread 49 is destroyed through pressure to ensure that the shaft 40 cannot be removed from the clamping assemblies 20, 30 to maintain the clamp as one single piece. Each clamping assembly 20 or 30 comprises two opposing clamping jaws 11 and 12. These jaws 11 and 12 are essentially similarly shaped on the sides facing each other. Each of the jaws 12, 11 comprises a respective contact surface 18, 19 facing the other surface of the jaw 11,12. In order to prevent rotation between the jaw 11 and the jaw 12 as well as in order to prevent a misalignment of the jaw 11, 12 at least one orientation device 13, 14 is arranged on the surfaces 18, 19. In the present embodiment in the second clamping assembly 30 the jaw 11 comprises an opening 14 extending into surface 18 and the jaw 12 comprises a pin 13 extending from surface 19. The pin 13 extends into the opening 14. This pin-opening connection prevents therefore a possible rotation between the jaws 11, 12 and a possible misalignment between the jaws 11,12. The jaws 11 and 12 are provided here with three grooves 51, 52 and 53. Grooves 51, 52 and 53 are all provided in a same plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of shaft 40. In that plane they are oriented perpendicular to the radial direction from the center of the bore 21 or 31. As such the grooves 51, 52 and 53 are substantially parallel to outer side wall 61, 62 or 63 of each pair of jaws 11 and 12. Each pair of grooves 51, 52 or 53, respectively, in each jaw 11 and 12, define one reception, i.e. a first reception 71, a second reception 72 and a third reception 73. The grooves 51, 52 and 53 are each formed as a rounded semi-spherical recess in section to provide receptions 71, 72 and 73 which accommodate cylindrical pins or rods with a defined diameter, if the clamp is closed. The outer side walls 61, 62 or 63 can comprise an inclined sliding surface to allow an easier clipping of such pins or rods 100 into the corresponding reception. The grooves 51, 52, 53 are called to form rounded semi-spherical recesses in a section. This means that the recesses provided by the grooves 51, 52, 53 have a hollow cylindrical shape to accommodate rod-shaped elements. Some or all of the grooves 51, 52, and 53 are also provided with friction enhancing elements such as ribs 56. All three grooves 51, 52 and 53 have different sizes so that the corresponding receptions 71, 72 and 73 have three different sizes. In other words each reception 71, 72 or 73 is adapted to accept a different fixation element, i.e. a rod, screw, pin or wire having a different diameter. One preferred embodiment of the first clamping assembly 20 has grooves to accept fixation elements having a diameter of 12 mm, 8 mm and 5 mm, respectively. A different embodiment may have a sequence of diameters of 8 mm, 6 mm and 4 mm, respectively. The second clamping assembly 30 according to the embodiment of Fig. 1 also comprises two jaw portions 11 and 12 and these comprise three grooves 51, 52, 53. These grooves 51, 52, 53 also comprise a sequence of different sizes. In the embodiment shown the inner jaws portion 12 have an identical structure as have the outer jaws 11, especially in view of the anti-rotation device 55, the reception 16 for a spring 15. Within a preferred embodiment the first clamping assembly 20 may comprise a sequence of smaller sizes, e.g. 7 mm, 5 mm and 3 mm; or 6 mm, 5mm and 4 mm; and the second clamping assembly 30 may comprise a sequence of larger sizes, e.g. 13.5 mm, 12 mm and 10 mm. Different sizes are possible, usually for wires starting from 2 mm diameter until thicker rods with a diameter of 30 mm are used within such a clamp 10. Such a clamp 10 allows using one single versatile clamp, wherein the first clamping assembly 20 is used to fix a specific pin or screw or wire having a diameter for which one of the receptions 71,72 or 73 is adapted. The user takes the clamp 10 and orients the first clamping assembly 20 into the correct alignment so that the pin or screw can be clipped into the corresponding reception. Then the clamp 10 can be clamped on a rod of an external fixator with the help of the second clamping assembly 30. Said second clamping assembly 30 can be oriented in a way so that the rod can be clipped into the corresponding reception. It is an advantage of the clamp 10 having two clamping assemblies 20 and 30 according to the invention, that a practitioner attaching such a clamp at a bone screw with one clamping assembly 20 and subsequently a rod of an external fixator to the other clamping assembly 30 can check the robustness of his external fixator, and if he finds that the rod he has used is not stiff enough, he simply opens the second clamping assembly 30, removes the thinner rod, turns the second clamping assembly 30 e.g. 60 degrees into one direction or the other around the longitudinal axis to align the larger reception with the new thicker rod and replaces it. This change does not necessitate the replacement of the clamp 10 itself as necessary with prior art systems. The method to replace such a rod is faster and more reliable since the clamping of the bone screw is not changed, and avoids use of a second sterile clamp at said time. It is of course also possible that the second clamping assembly 30 is a traditional clamping assembly or even any other element known in the prior art with clamping elements. The object of a versatile clamping assembly is already achieved through one first clamping assembly 20, since it allows clamping one of three different sizes of screws, pins of wires through simple reorientation of the first clamping assembly 20. Figure 2 shows a cross-section of the clamp according to figure 1, wherein the clamp 10 is shown in a premounted state, i.e. the spring 15 is under tension. The upper jaw 11 of the first clamping assembly 20 is therefore pushing the washer 41 against a flange 45 of the head of shaft 40. The bore 21 which accommodates part of the shaft portion 42 and the reduced diameter portion 43 is provided with a larger diameter than the respective diameter of the shaft 40 so that an angular or pivoting movement of the first clamping assembly 20 against the shaft 40 is possible. This is in particularly advantageous during the mounting process of the fixation clamp. With this regard it has to be noted that also bore 31 can be provided with a larger diameter than the respective section of the shaft 40 such that jaw 12 of the second clamping assembly becomes pivotable to the shaft 40. The diameter Dl, D2 of bore 21 of the first clamping assembly 20 is larger than the diameter of the locking element 40 extending through the bore 21. Thereby a pivoting movement or displacement between the locking element 40 and the first clamping assembly 20 during positioning the clamping assemblies 20, 30 and the pins or rods becomes possible. In the present embodiment the bore 21 in the first jaw 11 is a bore 21 having an abutment surface 86. The abutment surface 86 is provided by means a step-like bore 21 having a first section with a first diameter Dl and a second section with a second diameter D2. The first diameter Dl is larger than the second diameter D2. The abutment surface 86 serves as abutment element for the locking element 40 in particular for the flange 45 in case washer 41 is removed. Hence the abutment surface 86 together with the flange 45 prevents that the first clamping assembly 20 will be separated from the second clamping assembly 30 when the washer is removed. Particularly during a cleaning or sterilization process the prevention of such a separation is very advantageous. Alternatively the bore 21 can be provided with a conical section 32 as shown with bore 21 in the jaw 12 of the first clamping assembly. In the present embodiment there are two conical sections arranged, whereby the diameter of the bore 21 decreases with increasing length of the bore as seen from outside of the jaw 12. In case two conical sections 32 are present the degree of the pivoting motion can be increased. The shaft 40 as part of a locking element is threaded into the lower jaw 11 of the second clamping assembly 30. Hence the lower jaw 11 comprises a threaded opening. Threading may be provided in the bore or the screw may exhibit self-tapping threading. Quite generally, a.locking element may be provided which may be a lever locking element or a bayonet lock. Among these locking elements may also be supporting disks or toothed disks, which, for the sake of simplicity, are not shown in the drawings. Therefore the two clamp assemblies 20, 30 can be opened and closed through turning the head of shaft 40 and thus turning said shaft 40 in the jaw thread. In the cross-sectional view of figure 2 it can also be seen that the locking element 40 extends through the first clamping assembly 20 and is in contact with the second clamping assembly 30 by means of the threaded portion 49. In mounting position in which the rods or pins will be positioned in the receptions 71, 72, 73 the first clamping assembly 20 is moveable along the middle axis Μ of the threaded portion 49. Upon actuation of the locking element 40 the first clamping assembly 20 will be moved against the spring pressure towards the second clamping assembly 30 such that the anti-rotation surface 55 of the first clamping assembly 20 comes into contact with the respective anti-rotation surface 55 of the second clamping assembly 30. Once the locking element 40 is firmly tightened the first clamping assembly 20 and the second clamping assembly 30 are in contact with each other via the anti-rotation surface 55. In figure 2 the mounting position of clamping assemblies 20, 30 is shown. Thereby the clamping assemblies 20, 30 are positioned at the distance to each other with regard to the middle axis Μ. The second clamping assembly 20 is in contact with the locking element 40 and the spring 15 pushes the first clamping assembly away from the second clamping assembly 20 towards the washer 41 which is contact with the flange 45 of the locking element. To summarize: The clamping assemblies 20, 30 will be moved due to actuation of the locking element 40 from a mounting position to a locking position and afterwards when fixation shall be cancelled from the locking position to the mounting position. After use the washer 41 will be removed as explained below in order to sterilize the clamping element 10 for further use. Figure 3 shows a view from above on the clamp according to Figures 1 and 2. Since the embodiment of Fig. 1 comprises three grooves 51, 52 and 53, there are three side walls 61, 62 and 63, which provide, when looked from above as in Fig. 2 a triangular shape of each clamping assembly 20 or 30. In the present embodiment the first clamping assembly 20 here the jaw 11 comprises a first contact surface 80 which is in contact with a second contact surface 81 of the washer 41. The washer 41 and the first clamping assembly 20 are in contact via said contact surfaces 80, 81. The contact surfaces 80, 81 are spherical having the same curvature radius such that the washer 41 is enabled to slide with respect to the first clamping assembly 20 on the contact surface 80 when it comes to the above mentioned pivoting motion of the first clamping assembly 20 with respect to the locking element 40. The curvature is at least the same over an overlapping surface which here is defined as the surface which encompasses the maximal gliding motion of the washer 41 on the contact surface 80. In the present embodiment the first contact surface 80 has a convex shape, whereas the second contact surface 81 has a concave shape. Such a configuration is particularly advantageous as it allows a pivoting motion as mentioned above while providing a very compact structure of the fixation clamp in terms of axial and radial dimension. Furthermore the surfaces which are shaped as explained allow that the washer 41 as explained en detail below is removable from the clamping element 10. Thereby the first clamping assembly 20 and the second clamping assembly 30 become loose such that the parts are slightly moveable along middle axis Μ and sterilization of the clamping element 10 is possible without demounting the clamping element 10 completely. This is very advantageous since during sterilization the parts remain together and re-assembly of the parts afterwards is not necessary. Hence the parts of the clamping element 10 remain loosely together such that the sterilization fluid is able to enter clearances between the respective parts. As mentioned above providing the diameters D1 and D2 accordingly, the abutment surface 86 serves as element which holds the parts loosely together. The first contact surface 80 of the first clamping assembly 20 extends from a section point 82 between the middle axis Μ of the locking element 40 and said first contact surface 80 towards the first clamping assembly 20. Figure 3 shows the clamping element from above. In figure 3 the overlapping surface with limiting edges 54 can be recognized. Figure 4 shows the washer 41 in a perspective view and in figure 2 a cross-sectional view of the washer 41 is shown. In the following the structure of the washer 41 will be explained. The washer 41 comprises as mentioned above the contact surface 81 and an upper surface 88 which is arranged at a distance from the contact surface 81. A central through opening 84 having a middle axis Ml that is at least partly circumvented by means of a sidewall 85. Said through opening extends from contact surface 81 to the upper surface 88. Through said through opening the locking element 40 extends. The sidewall 85 is interrupted by cutout 87 which extends radially to the middle axis Ml through the sidewall 85 to the opening 84 such that the sidewall 85 becomes interrupted. The cutout 87 has a width which is slightly larger than the reduced diameter portion 43 of the locking element 40 such that the washer 41 can be moved radially to the locking element 40 in order to remove the washer 41 after the use of the clamping element 10. The width is defined as the clearance of the cutout 87 from the surfaces 89 of the sidewall limiting the cutout. Furthermore the washer 41 comprises a recess 83 extending along middle axis Ml from an upper surface 88 which is arranged opposite the contact surface 81. The recess 83 is designed to accommodate the flange 45 of the locking element 40. The recess 83 can also be designated as abutment element since it prevents that the washer can be radially displaced to the middle axis Μ of the locking element 40. In order to demount the washer 41 it is necessary to push the first clamping assembly 10 towards the second clamping assembly, such the washer 41 can also be moved along the middle axis Μ of the locking element 40. Thereby the flange 45 will be moved out of the recess 83. Once the flange 45 has been moved such that there is no connection between the flange 45 and the recess 83, the washer 41 can be moved radially to the locking element 40 whereby the shaft of the locking element will pass the cutout 87 of the washer. Said recess 83 extends from the upper surface 88 along the middle axis Ml of the through opening 84 into the washer 41. The washer is preferably made out of a metallic material. To summarize the arrangement of the contact surfaces 80, 81 has the advantage that during the mounting process of the fixation clamp 10 a pivoting motion of the first clamping assembly becomes possible with a large deflection. Furthermore the removable washer 41 has the advantage that the clamping assemblies 20, 30 become moveable along the interlocking element 40 such that an effective sterilization becomes possible.
