Step 3: preparation of intermediate tert-butyl 3-[allyloxy-(2-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl-amino]-5-oxazol-2-yl-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylate (7c)
To a suspension of NaH 60% in oil (97 mg, 2.42 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (4 mL) at 0°C under nitrogen atmosphere was portionwise added N-allyloxy-2-nitro-benzenesulfonamide (624 mg, 2.42 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 15 min then a solution of tert-butyl 3-bromo-5-oxazol-2-yl-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylate (7b) (692 mg, 2.10 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (2 mL) was dropwise added. The mixture was stirred for 90 min at 0°C then H2O was added. The mixture was extracted twice with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (petroleum ether/acetone: 100/0 to 80/20) to provide tert-butyl 3-[allyloxy-(2-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl-amino]-5-oxazol-2-yl-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylate (7c) (513 mg, 1.01 mmol, 48%) as a solid.
