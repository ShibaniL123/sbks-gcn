8-(4-(3,4-bis(methyl-d3)phenyl)-5-methylpyridin-2-yl)-2-methylbenzofuro[2,3-b]pyridine (5 g, 13.00 mmol) was dissolved in 45 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF). Dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (40 ml, 571 mmol) was added by syringe into the reaction mixture. Sodium tert-butoxide (0.63 g, 6.56 mmol) was added as one portion to the reaction mixture. This mixture was degassed and heated at 65° C. for 17 hours, then cooled down to room temperature. The reaction mixture was quenched with 60 mL of D20 and was stirred at room temperature for 45 minutes. This mixture was then diluted with 200 mL of water, then extracted with 3×70 mL DCM. These extracts were combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, then filtered and concentrated under vacuum, The crude residue was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel columns eluted with 1-3 vol-% THF/97-99 vol-% DCM. The resulting product fractions were combined and concentrated under vacuum yielding 4 g of product. This material was recrystallized from ethyl acetate several times yielding 8-(4-(3,4-bis(methyl-d3)phenyl)-5-(methyl-d3)pyridin-2-yl)-2-(methyl-d3)benzofuro[2,3-b]pyridine (2.1 g, 5.38 mmol, 41.4% yield).
