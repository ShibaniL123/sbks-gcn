A solution of (1-methyl-2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexan-4-yl)methanol (250 mg, 1.95 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (3 mL)/acetonitrile (3.00 mL)/water (3.00 mL) was cooled to 0Â° C. and stirred rapidly while sodium periodate (1.25 g, 5.9 mmol) and ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate (44.0 mg, 0.20 mmol) were added. The ice bath was removed and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc and stirred while 1 N HCl was added until all solids dissolved. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc. The combined extracts were washed with 10% NaHSO3 solution, brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (0-20% MeOH/DCM) to afford the title compound (142 mg, 51%).
