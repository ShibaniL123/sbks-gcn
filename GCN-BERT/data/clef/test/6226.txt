FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to cleaning compositions and, more specifically, to cleaning compositions containing a polyetheramine that is suitable for removal of stains from soiled materials. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Due to the increasing popularity of easy-care fabrics made of synthetic fibers as well as the ever increasing energy costs and growing ecological concerns of detergent users, the once popular warm and hot water washes have now taken a back seat to washing fabrics in cold water (30° C. and below). Many commercially available laundry detergents are even advertised as being suitable for washing fabrics at 15° C. or even 9° C. To achieve satisfactory washing results at such low temperatures, results comparable to those obtained with hot-water washes, the demands on low-temperature detergents are especially high. It is known to include certain additives in detergent compositions to enhance the detergent power of conventional surfactants, so as to improve the removal of grease stains at temperatures of 30° C. and below. For example, laundry detergents containing an aliphatic amine compound, in addition to at least one synthetic anionic and/or nonionic surfactant, are known. Also, the use of linear, alkyl-modified (secondary) alkoxypropylamines in laundry detergents to improve cleaning at low temperatures is known. These known laundry detergents, however, are unable to achieve satisfactory cleaning at cold temperatures. Furthermore, the use of linear, primary polyoxyalkyleneamines (e.g., Jeffamine® D-230) to stabilize fragrances in laundry detergents and provide longer lasting scent is also known. Also, the use of high-moleculer-weight (molecular weight of at least about 1000), branched, trifunctional, primary amines (e.g., Jeffamine® T-5000 polyetheramine) to suppress suds in liquid detergents is known. Additionally, an etheramine mixture containing a monoether diamine (e.g., at least 10% by weight of the etheramine mixture), methods for its production, and its use as a curing agent or as a raw material in the synthesis of polymers are known. Finally, the use of compounds derived from the reaction of diamines or polyamines with alkylene oxides and compounds derived from the reaction of amine terminated polyethers with epoxide functional compounds to suppress suds is known. There is a continuing need for a detergent additive that can improve cleaning performance at low wash temperatures, e.g., at 30° C. or even lower, without interfering with the production and the quality of the laundry detergents in any way. More specifically, there is a need for a detergent additive that can improve cold water grease cleaning, without adversely affecting particulate cleaning. Surprisingly, it has been found that the cleaning compositions of the invention provide increased grease removal (particularly in cold water). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention attempts to solve one more of the needs by providing, in one aspect of the invention, a cleaning composition (in liquid, powder, unit dose, pouch, or tablet forms) comprising from about 1% to about 70%, by weight of the composition, of a surfactant system; and from about 0.1% to about 10%, by weight of the composition, of a polyetheramine of Formula (I), Formula (II), or a mixture thereof where R1 is a linear or branched alkyl group with 2 to 16 carbon atoms, R2 is a hydrogen or an alkyl group with 1 to 16 carbon atoms; where each of A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6 is independently selected from a linear alkylene having 2 to 18 carbon atoms or a branched alkylene having 2 to 18 carbon atoms; where each of Z1-Z4 is independently selected from OH, NH2, NHR′, or NR′R″, where at least one of Z1-Z2 and at least one of Z3-Z4 is NH2, NHR′, or NR′R″, where each of R′ and R″ is independently selected from alkylenes having 2 to 6 carbon atoms; where the sum of w+x+y+z is from about 0 to about 100, where the sum of a+b is from 0 to 100, and where w≧0, x≧0, y≧0, z≧0, a≧0, and b≧0. The present disclosure further relates to a cleaning composition comprising from about 1% to about 70%, by weight of the composition, of a surfactant system; and from about 0.1% to about 10%, by weight of the composition, of a polyetheramine obtainable by: (i) reacting a 1,2-dialcohol of Formula (III) with a C2-C18 alkylene oxide, where the molar ratio of 1,2-dialcohol to C2-C18 alkylene oxide is in the range of from about 1:2 to about 1:10, where R1 is a linear or branched alkyl group with 2 to 16 carbon atoms, R2 is a hydrogen or an alkyl group with 1 to 16 carbon atoms; and (ii) aminating the alkoxylated 1,2-dialcohol with ammonia. The present invention further relates to methods of cleaning soiled materials. Such methods include pretreatment of soiled material comprising contacting the soiled material with the cleaning compositions of the invention.

Such compositions may be used as a pre-laundering treatment, a post-laundering treatment, or may be added during the rinse or wash cycle of the laundering operation. The cleaning compositions may have a form selected from liquid, powder, single-phase or multi-phase unit dose, pouch, tablet, gel, paste, bar, or flake. Polyetheramines The cleaning compositions described herein may include from about 0.1% to about 10%, in some examples, from about 0.2% to about 5%, and in other examples, from about 0.5% to about 3%, by weight the composition, of a polyetheramine. In some aspects, the polyetheramine is selected from Formula (I), Formula (II), or a mixture thereof: where R1 is a linear or branched alkyl group with 2 to 16 carbon atoms, R2 is a hydrogen or an alkyl group with 1 to 16 carbon atoms; where each of A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6 is independently selected from a linear alkylene having 2 to 18 carbon atoms or a branched alkylene having 2 to 18 carbon atoms; where each of Z1-Z4 is independently selected from OH, NH2, NHR′, or NR′R″, where at least one of Z1-Z2 and at least one of Z3-Z4 is NH2, NHR′, or NR′R″, where each of R′ and R″ is independently selected from alkylenes having 2 to 6 carbon atoms; where the sum of w+x+y+z is from about 0 to about 100, where the sum of a+b is from 0 to 100, and where w≧0, x≧0, y≧0, z≧0, a≧0, and b≧0. In some aspects, R1 is a linear or branched alkyl group with 3 to 16 carbon atoms and R2 is a hydrogen or an alkyl group with 1 to 16 carbon atoms. In certain aspects, R1 is a linear alkyl group with 3 to 8 carbon atoms and R2 is hydrogen. A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6 may be identical or different. In some aspects, at least two of the A1-A6 groups are the same, or at least two of the A1-A6 groups are different, or all the A1-A6 groups are different from each other. Typically, each of A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6 is independently selected from 1,2-propylene or 1,2-butylene, more typically each of A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6 is independently selected from 1,2-propylene or 1,2-butylene and at least one of A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6 is 1,2-propylene. In some aspects, each of A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6 is 1,2-propylene. When A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and/or A6 are a mixture of 1,2-propylene and 1,2-butylene groups, the resulting alkoxylate may have a block-wise structure or a random structure. In some aspects, each of Z1-Z4 is NH2. In some aspects, the sum of w+x+y+z is from about 1 to about 100, or from about 2 to about 25, or from about 3 to about 10, or about 3 to about 8, or from about 3 to about 6, or from about 3 to about 4. In some aspects, the sum of a+b for a polyetheramine according to Formula (II) is from about 1 to about 100, or from about 2 to about 25, or from about 3 to about 10, or from about 3 to about 8, or from about 3 to about 6, or from about 3 to about 4. In some aspects, w, x, y, and/or z are independently equal to 2 or greater, meaning that the polyetheramine of Formula (I) may have more than one [O-A2] group, more than one [O-A3] group, more than one [A4-O] group, and/or more than one [A5-O] group. In some aspects, A2 is selected from propylene, butylene, or mixtures thereof. In some aspects, A3 is selected from propylene, butylene, or mixtures thereof. In some aspects, A4 is selected from propylene, butylene, or mixtures thereof. In some aspects, A5 is selected from propylene, butylene, or mixtures thereof. Similarly, the polyetheramine of Formula (II) may have more than one [A4-O] group and/or more than one [A5-O] group. In some aspects, A4 is selected from propylene, butylene, or mixtures thereof. In some aspects, A5 is selected from propylene, butylene, or mixtures thereof. When A2, A3, A4, and/or A5 are mixtures of propylene and butylene, the resulting alkoxylate may have a block-wise structure or a random structure. For a nonlimiting illustration, when y=6 in the polyetheramine according to Formula (I), then the polyetheramine comprises six [A4-O] groups. If A4 comprises a mixture of butylene groups and propylene groups, then the resulting polyetheramine would comprise a mixture of butylene oxide (BO) groups and propylene oxide (PO) groups. These groups may be arranged in a random structure (e.g., BO-BO-PO-BO-PO-PO) or a block-wise structure (BO-BO-BO-PO-PO-PO). In this illustrative example, there are an equal number of different alkoxy groups (here, three BO and three PO), but there may also be different numbers of each alkoxy group (e.g., five BO and one PO). Furthermore, when the polyetheramine comprises alkoxy groups in a block-wise structure, the polyetheramine may comprise two blocks, as shown in the illustrative example (where the three BO groups form one block and the three PO groups form another block), or the polyetheramine may comprise more than two blocks. The above discussion also applies to polyethermines according to Formula (II). Typically, the polyetheramine of Formula (I) or Formula (II) has a weight average molecular weight of about 270 to about 1000 grams/mole, typically, about 270 to about 650 grams/mole. The molecular mass of a polymer differs from typical molecules in that polymerization reactions produce a distribution of molecular weights, which is summarized by the weight average molecular weight. The polyetheramine polymers of the invention are thus distributed over a range of molecular weights. Differences in the molecular weights are primarily attributable to differences in the number of monomer units that sequence together during synthesis. With regard to the polyetheramine polymers of the invention, the monomer units are the alkylene oxides that react with the 1,2-dialcohol of Formula (III) to form alkoxylated 1,2-dialcohols, which are then aminated to form the resulting polyetheramine polymers. The resulting polyetheramine polymers are characterized by the sequence of alkylene oxide units. The alkoxylation reaction results in a distribution of sequences of alkylene oxide and, hence, a distribution of molecular weights. The alkoxylation reaction also produces unreacted alkylene oxide monomer (“unreacted monomers”) that do not react during the reaction and remain in the composition. In some aspects, the polyetheramine comprises a mixture of the compound of Formula (I) and the compound of Formula (II). In some aspects, the polyetheramine comprises a polyetheramine mixture comprising at least 80% or at least 90%, by weight of the polyetheramine mixture, of the polyetheramine of Formula (I), the polyetheramine of Formula(II), or a mixture thereof. In some aspects, the polyetheramine mixture may result from the polymer synthesis process, which may provide polymers in a distribution of molecular weights or degrees of alkoxylation. Therefore, in some aspects, the polyetheramine of the present disclosure comprises a mixture of a first polyetheramine and a second polyetheramine. In some aspects, the first polyetheramine is selected from Formula (I) or Formula (II), where the sum of w+x+y+z is from about 3 to about 10, and the second polyetheramine is selected from Formula (I) or Formula (II), where the sum of w+x+y+z is from 0 to 2. In some aspects, the polyetheramine comprises a polyetheramine mixture comprising at least about 80%, or at least about 90%, by weight of the polyetheramine mixture, of the first polyetheramine, and about 0% to about 20%, or about 0.1% to about 10%, or from about 1% to about 8%, by weight of the polyetheramine mixture, of the second polyetheramine. The polyetheramine of Formula (I) and/or the polyetheramine of Formula(II) are obtainable by: a) reacting a 1,2-dialcohol of formula (III) with a C2-C18 alkylene oxide, wherein the molar ratio of 1,2-dialcohol to C2-C18 alkylene oxides is in the range of 1:2 to 1:10, where R1 is a linear or branched alkyl group with 2 to 16 carbon atoms, R2 is a hydrogen or an alkyl group with 1 to 16 carbon atoms; and b) aminating the alkoxylated 1,2-dialcohol with ammonia. Typically, the C2-C18 alkylene oxides are selected from the group consisting of propylene oxide, butylene oxide, and mixtures thereof. In some aspects, the C2-C18 alkylene oxide is propylene oxide. The 1,2-dialcohol of Formula (III) is typically selected from the group consisting of 1,2-pentanediol, 1,2-hexanediol, 1,2-heptanediol, 1,2-octanediol, 1,2-nonanediol, 1,2-decanediol and 1,2-dodecanediol, 1,2-tetradecandiol, 1,2 hexadecandiol and 1,2octadecandiol. Step a): Alkoxylation Substituted 1,2-dialcohols (Formula (III)) are synthesized as described in WO 10/026030, WO 10/026066, WO 09/138387, WO 09/153193, WO 10/010075. An alkoxylated 1,2-dialcohol may be obtained by reaction of a 1,2-dialcohol (Formula (III)) with an alkylene oxide, according to any number of general alkoxylation procedures known in the art. Suitable alkylene oxides include C2-C18 alkylene oxides, such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, pentene oxide, hexene oxide, decene oxide, dodecene oxide, or mixtures thereof. In some aspects, the C2-C18 alkylene oxide is selected from propylene oxide, butylene oxide, or a mixture thereof. In some aspects, the C2-C18 alkylene oxide is a propylene oxide. The 1,2-dialcohol may be reacted with a single alkylene oxide or combinations of two or more different alkylene oxides. When using two or more different alkylene oxides, the resulting polymer may be obtained as a block-wise structure or a random structure. In some aspects, the molar ratio of 1,2-dialcohol to C2-C18 alkylene oxide at which the alkoxylation reaction is carried out is in the range of about 1:2 to about 1:10 or about 1:3 to about 1:8, typically in the range of about 1:4 to about 1:6. The alkoxylation reaction is generally performed in the presence of a catalyst in an aqueous solution at a reaction temperature of from about 70° C. to about 200° C., more typically from about 80° C. to about 160° C. This reaction may proceed at a pressure of up to about 10 bar, and in particular up to about 8 bar. Examples of suitable catalysts are basic catalysts, such as alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, alkali metal alkoxides, in particular sodium and potassium C1-C4-alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide and potassium tert-butoxide, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydrides, such as sodium hydride and calcium hydride, and alkali metal carbonates, such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. Particularly suitable catalysts include alkali metal hydroxides, typically potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. Typical use amounts for the catalyst are from about 0.05% to about 10% by weight, or from about 0.1% to about 2% by weight, based on the total amount of 1,2-dialcohol and alkylene oxide. During the alkoxylation reaction, certain impurities—unintended constituents of the polymer—may be formed, such as catalysts residues. Alkoxylation with w+x+y+z and/or a+b C2-C18 alkylene oxides leads to structures as represented by Formula IV and/or Formula V: where R1 is a linear or branched alkyl group with 2 to 16 carbon atoms, R2 is a hydrogen or an alkyl group with 1 to 16 carbon atoms; where each of A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6 is independently selected from a linear alkylene having 2 to 18 carbon atoms or a branched alkylene having 2 to 18 carbon atoms; where the sum of w+x+y+z is from about 0 to about 100, where the sum of a+b is from 0 to 100, and where w≧0, x≧0, y≧0, z≧0, a≧0, and b≧0. Step b): Amination Amination of the alkoxylated 1,2-dialcohols produces structures represented by Formula I, Formula II, or mixtures thereof: where R1 is a linear or branched alkyl group with 2 to 16 carbon atoms, R2 is a hydrogen or an alkyl group with 1 to 16 carbon atoms; where each of A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6 is independently selected from a linear alkylene having 2 to 18 carbon atoms or a branched alkylene having 2 to 18 carbon atoms; where each of Z1-Z4 is independently selected from OH, NH2, NHR′, or NR′R″, where at least one of Z1-Z2 and at least one of Z3-Z4 is NH2, NHR′, or NR′R″, where each of R′ and R″ is independently selected from alkylenes having 2 to 6 carbon atoms; where the sum of w+x+y+z is from about 0 to about 100, where the sum of a+b is from 0 to 100, and where w≧0, x≧0, y≧0, z≧0, a≧0, and b≧0. Polyetheramines according to Formula (I) and/or Formula (II) are obtained by reductive amination of the alkoxylated 1,2-dialcohol mixture (Formula IV and V) with ammonia in presence of hydrogen and a catalyst containing nickel. Suitable catalysts are described in WO 11/067199 A1 and in WO 11/067200 A1, and in EP 0 696 572 B1. Particularly suitable catalysts are supported copper-, nickel- and cobalt-containing catalysts, where the catalytically active material of the catalysts, before the reduction thereof with hydrogen, comprises oxygen compounds of aluminium, of copper, of nickel and of cobalt, and further comprises in the range from about 0.2% to about 5.0% by weight of oxygen compounds of tin, calculated as SnO. Other suitable catalysts are supported copper-, nickel- and cobalt-containing catalysts, where the catalytically active material of the catalysts, before the reduction thereof with hydrogen, comprises oxygen compounds of aluminium, of copper, of nickel, of cobalt, and of tin, and further comprises in the range from 0.2 to 5.0% by weight of oxygen compounds of yttrium, of lanthanum, of cerium, and/or of hafnium, each calculated as Y2O3, La2O3, Ce2O3, and Hf2O3 respectively. Another preferred catalyst is a zirconium, copper, nickel catalyst, where the catalytically active composition comprises from about 20% to about 85% by weight of oxygen-containing zirconium compounds, calculated as ZrO2, from about 1% to about 30% by weight of oxygen-containing compounds of copper, calculated as CuO, from about 30% to about 70% by weight of oxygen-containing compounds of nickel, calculated as NiO, from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of oxygen-containing compounds of aluminium and/or manganese, calculated as Al2O3 and MnO2 respectively. For the reductive amination step, a supported as well as a non-supported catalysts may be used. For example, the supported catalyst may be obtained by deposition of the metallic components of the catalyst compositions onto support materials known to those skilled in the art using techniques, which are well-known in the art, including, without limitation, known forms of alumina, silica, charcoal, carbon, graphite, clays, mordenites; and molecular sieves, to provide supported catalysts as well. When the catalyst is supported, the support particles of the catalyst may have any geometric shape, for example, the shape of spheres, tablets, or cylinders in a regular or irregular version. The process may be carried out in a continuous or discontinuous mode, e.g., in an autoclave, tube reactor or fixed-bed reactor. The feed thereto may be upflowing or downflowing, and design features in the reactor that optimize plug flow in the reactor may be employed. By-products that contain secondary or tertiary amino functions may be formed under amination reaction conditions. Secondary amines are, for example, obtained from a reaction of a fully or partially aminated diol with another fully and/or partially aminated diol. Tertiary amines are formed, for example, via a reaction of a secondary amine with another fully or partially aminated diol. In some aspects, the degree of amination is between about 50 to about 100%, typically from about 75% to about 100%, and more typically from about 90% to about 100%. The degree of amination is calculated from the total amine value (AZ) divided by sum of the total acetylables value (AC) and tertiary amine value (tert. AZ) multiplied by 100: (Total AZ: (AC+tert. AZ)×100). The total amine value (AZ) is determined according to DIN 16945, March 1989. The total acetylables value (AC) is determined according to DIN 53240, December 1971. The secondary and tertiary amines are determined according to ASTM D2074-07, July 2007. The hydroxyl value is calculated from (total acetylables value+tertiary amine value)−total amine value. The polyetheramines of the invention are effective for removal of stains, particularly grease, from soiled material. Cleaning compositions containing the polyetheramines of the invention also do not exhibit the cleaning negatives seen with conventional amine-containing cleaning compositions on hydrophilic bleachable stains, such as coffee, tea, wine, or particulates. Additionally, unlike conventional amine-containing cleaning compositions, the polyetheramines of the invention do not contribute to whiteness negatives on white fabrics. The polyetheramines of the invention may be used in the form of a water-based, water-containing, or water-free solution, emulsion, gel or paste of the polyetheramine together with an acid such as, for example, citric acid, lactic acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, hydrogen chloride, e.g., aqeous hydrogen chloride, phosphoric acid, or mixtures thereof. Alternatively, the acid may be represented by a surfactant, such as, alkyl benzene sulphonic acid, alkylsulphonic acid, monoalkyl esters of sulphuric acid, mono alkylethoxy esters of sulphuric acid, fatty acids, alkyl ethoxy carboxylic acids, and the like, or mixtures thereof. When applicable or measurable, the preferred pH of the solution or emulsion ranges from pH 3 to pH 11, or from pH 6 to pH 9.5, even more preferred from pH 7 to pH 8.5. Tertiary dialkyl-substituted polyetheramines may be prepared from the respective primary polyetheramines by reductive amination. Typical procedures involve the use of formaldehyde or other alkylaldehydes, such as ethanal, 1-propanal or 1-butanal, in the presence of a hydrogen donor, such as formic acid, or the in the presence of hydrogen gas and a transition metal containing catalyst. Alternatively, dialky-substituted tertiary polyetheramines may be obtained by reacting a polyether alcohol with a dialkylamine, such as dimethylamine, in the presence of a suitable transition metal catalyst, typically in the additional presence of hydrogen and under continuous removal of the reaction water. A further advantage of cleaning compositions containing the polyetheramines of the invention is their ability to remove grease stains in cold water, for example, via pretreatment of a grease stain followed by cold water washing. Without being limited by theory, it is believed that cold water washing solutions have the effect of hardening or solidifying grease, making the grease more resistant to removal, especially on fabric. Cleaning compositions containing the polyetheramines of the invention are surprisingly effective when used as part of a pretreatment regimen followed by cold water washing. Surfactant System The cleaning compositions comprise a surfactant system in an amount sufficient to provide desired cleaning properties. In some embodiments, the cleaning composition comprises, by weight of the composition, from about 1% to about 70% of a surfactant system. In other embodiments, the liquid cleaning composition comprises, by weight of the composition, from about 2% to about 60% of the surfactant system. In further embodiments, the cleaning composition comprises, by weight of the composition, from about 5% to about 30% of the surfactant system. The surfactant system may comprise a detersive surfactant selected from anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, ampholytic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that a detersive surfactant encompasses any surfactant or mixture of surfactants that provide cleaning, stain removing, or laundering benefit to soiled material. Anionic Surfactants In some examples, the surfactant system of the cleaning composition may comprise from about 1% to about 70%, by weight of the surfactant system, of one or more anionic surfactants. In other examples, the surfactant system of the cleaning composition may comprise from about 2% to about 60%, by weight of the surfactant system, of one or more anionic surfactants. In further examples, the surfactant system of the cleaning composition may comprise from about 5% to about 30%, by weight of the surfactant system, of one or more anionic surfactants. In further examples, the surfactant system may consist essentially of, or even consist of one or more anionic surfactants. Specific, non-limiting examples of suitable anionic surfactants include any conventional anionic surfactant. This may include a sulfate detersive surfactant, for e.g., alkoxylated and/or non-alkoxylated alkyl sulfate materials, and/or sulfonic detersive surfactants, e.g., alkyl benzene sulfonates. Alkoxylated alkyl sulfate materials comprise ethoxylated alkyl sulfate surfactants, also known as alkyl ether sulfates or alkyl polyethoxylate sulfates. Examples of ethoxylated alkyl sulfates include water-soluble salts, particularly the alkali metal, ammonium and alkylolammonium salts, of organic sulfuric reaction products having in their molecular structure an alkyl group containing from about 8 to about 30 carbon atoms and a sulfonic acid and its salts. (Included in the term “alkyl” is the alkyl portion of acyl groups. In some examples, the alkyl group contains from about 15 carbon atoms to about 30 carbon atoms. In other examples, the alkyl ether sulfate surfactant may be a mixture of alkyl ether sulfates, said mixture having an average (arithmetic mean) carbon chain length within the range of about 12 to 30 carbon atoms, and in some examples an average carbon chain length of about 25 carbon atoms, and an average (arithmetic mean) degree of ethoxylation of from about 1 mol to 4 mols of ethylene oxide, and in some examples an average (arithmetic mean) degree of ethoxylation of 1.8 mols of ethylene oxide. In further examples, the alkyl ether sulfate surfactant may have a carbon chain length between about 10 carbon atoms to about 18 carbon atoms, and a degree of ethoxylation of from about 1 to about 6 mols of ethylene oxide. Non-ethoxylated alkyl sulfates may also be added to the disclosed cleaning compositions and used as an anionic surfactant component. Examples of non-alkoxylated, e.g., non-ethoxylated, alkyl sulfate surfactants include those produced by the sulfation of higher C8-C20 fatty alcohols. In some examples, primary alkyl sulfate surfactants have the general formula: ROSO3−M+, wherein R is typically a linear C8-C20 hydrocarbyl group, which may be straight chain or branched chain, and M is a water-solubilizing cation. In some examples, R is a C10-C15 alkyl, and M is an alkali metal. In other examples, R is a C12-C14 alkyl and M is sodium. Other useful anionic surfactants can include the alkali metal salts of alkyl benzene sulfonates, in which the alkyl group contains from about 9 to about 15 carbon atoms, in straight chain (linear) or branched chain configuration, e.g. those of the type described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,220,099 and 2,477,383. In some examples, the alkyl group is linear. Such linear alkylbenzene sulfonates are known as “LAS.” In other examples, the linear alkylbenzene sulfonate may have an average number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group of from about 11 to 14.

Preferably, these aminophosphonates do not contain alkyl or alkenyl groups with more than about 6 carbon atoms. Polyfunctionally-substituted aromatic chelating agents may also be used in the cleaning compositions. See U.S. Pat. No. 3,812,044, issued May 21, 1974, to Connor et al. Compounds of this type in acid form are dihydroxydisulfobenzenes, such as 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-disulfobenzene. A biodegradable chelator that may also be used herein is ethylenediamine disuccinate (“EDDS”). In some examples, but of course not limited to this particular example, the [S,S] isomer as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,233 may be used. In other examples, the trisodium salt of EDDA may be used, though other forms, such as magnesium salts, may also be useful. Suds Suppressors Compounds for reducing or suppressing the formation of suds can be incorporated into the cleaning compositions described herein. Suds suppression can be of particular importance in the so-called “high concentration cleaning process” as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,489,455, 4,489,574, and in front-loading style washing machines. A wide variety of materials may be used as suds suppressors, and suds suppressors are well known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 7, pages 430-447 (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1979).

As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the cleaning compositions of the present invention are suited for use in laundry pretreatment applications, laundry cleaning applications, and home care applications. Such methods include, but are not limited to, the steps of contacting cleaning compositions in neat form or diluted in wash liquor, with at least a portion of a soiled material and then optionally rinsing the soiled material. The soiled material may be subjected to a washing step prior to the optional rinsing step. For use in laundry pretreatment applications, the method may include contacting the cleaning compositions described herein with soiled fabric. Following pretreatment, the soiled fabric may be laundered in a washing machine or otherwise rinsed. Machine laundry methods may comprise treating soiled laundry with an aqueous wash solution in a washing machine having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount of a machine laundry cleaning composition in accord with the invention. An “effective amount” of the cleaning composition means from about 20 g to about 300 g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from about 5 L to about 65 L. The water temperatures may range from about 5° C. to about 100° C. The water to soiled material (e.g., fabric) ratio may be from about 1:1 to about 20:1. In the context of a fabric laundry composition, usage levels may also vary depending not only on the type and severity of the soils and stains, but also on the wash water temperature, the volume of wash water, and the type of washing machine (e.g., top-loading, front-loading, top-loading, vertical-axis Japanese-type automatic washing machine). The cleaning compositions herein may be used for laundering of fabrics at reduced wash temperatures. These methods of laundering fabric comprise the steps of delivering a laundry cleaning composition to water to form a wash liquor and adding a laundering fabric to said wash liquor, wherein the wash liquor has a temperature of from about 0° C. to about 20° C., or from about 0° C. to about 15° C., or from about 0° C. to about 9° C. The fabric may be contacted to the water prior to, or after, or simultaneous with, contacting the laundry cleaning composition with water. Another method includes contacting a nonwoven substrate impregnated with an embodiment of the cleaning composition with soiled material. As used herein, “nonwoven substrate” can comprise any conventionally fashioned nonwoven sheet or web having suitable basis weight, caliper (thickness), absorbency, and strength characteristics. Non-limiting examples of suitable commercially available nonwoven substrates include those marketed under the tradenames SONTARA® by DuPont and POLYWEB® by James River Corp.

Water hardness was 2.5 mM (Ca2+: Mg2+ was 3:1). Standard colorimetric measurement was used to obtain L*, a* and b* values for each stain before and after the washing. From L*, a* and b* values, the stain level was calculated. Stain removal from the swatches was measured as follows: Stain   Removal   Index   ( SRI ) = Δ   E initial - Δ   E washed Δ   E initial × 100 Δ   E initial = Stain   level   before   washing Δ   E washed = Stain   level   after   washing The stain level of the fabric before the washing (ΔEinitial) is high; in the washing process, stains are removed and the stain level after washing is reduced (ΔEwashed). The better a stain has been removed, the lesser the value for ΔEwashed and the greater the difference between ΔEinitial and ΔEwashed (ΔEinitial−ΔEwashed). Therefore the value of the stain removal index increases with better washing performance.
