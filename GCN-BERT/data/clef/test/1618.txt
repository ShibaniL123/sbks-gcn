TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention belongs to the field of pharmaceutical technology. More specifically, the present invention relates to crystal forms of a compound as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, a method for preparing the same, and use of crystal forms of the compound in manufacture of a medicament for treating and/or preventing kidney injury or cardiovascular disease. BACKGROUND Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone synthesized at the adrenal cortex, and can bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor and activate the receptor to promote the conservation of sodium and the excretion of potassium. It may have an important role in keeping the electrolyte balance and changing the structure and function of endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts on the arterial wall as well as the arterial adventitia and the matrix on its media. The high level of aldosterone may result in the abnormal activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor, which can cause the electrolyte imbalance, the blood vessel injury, the fibrosis and the like, and result in the cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, the injury to the organ such as kidney, heart and brain, the endocrine disturbance and the like. A drug that blocks the binding of aldosterone and the mineralocorticoid receptor by competitively binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor can therefore inhibit the aldosterone-mediated injury and reduce the occurrence of the above mentioned disease. The compound represented by Formula (1), 2-chloro-4-[(3S,3aR)-3-cyclopentyl-7-(4-hydroxypiperidin-1-carbonyl)-3,3a,4,5-tetrahydro-2H-pyrazolo[3,4-f]quinolin-2-yl]benzonitrile, as disclosed in the application WO2012022121, is an aldosterone receptor antagonist, which can selectively bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor, and has a lower affinity to the glucocorticoid and the androgen receptor. WO2012022121 discloses a process for preparing the compound represented by formula (1), which is obtained by chirally resolving the racemic mixture containing the compound represented by formula (1) following by the rotary-evaporation to dryness. The obtained compound is in the amorphous form. The compound of formula (1) has two chiral centers. In order to obtain a single isomer, those skilled in the art will resolve the racemic mixture. According to WO2012022121, the racemic mixture containing the compound represented by formula (1) is firstly obtained, and then resolved to obtain the compound represented by formula (1), which makes it difficult to produce the compound represented by formula (1) in a GMP standard plant, resulting in the difficulty in the industrialization and the higher production cost.

Assay 3 Organ protection and depressurization effect of Crystal Form I of the present invention on the high salt induced Dahl salt sensitive (Dahl/SS) rats Sample and sample preparation: The solid dispersion of Crystal Form I of the present invention (Crystal Form I of the present invention:PVPK30=1:8(w/w)): the solid dispersion of Crystal Form I of the present invention was formulated with a suitable amount of sterile water for injection into suspensions having concentrations of 0.03, 0.10, 0.30, and 1.00 mg/mL. The suspension was prepared before use every day. Animal group and model: Experiment animals: male Dahl/ss rats of SPF (specific pathogen free)-grade, 8-9 weeks, purchased via Vital River Laboratories from HARLAN LABORATORIES, INC. After one week normal quarantine, rats in good sign and condition were used in the experiment. Dahl/ss rats were randomly divided into six groups according to the blood pressure measurement before administration: Normal control (n=10), Model group (4% NaCl, n=12), Treatment groups with Crystal Form I of the present invention, four groups: The treatment group with 0.3 mg/kg/day (n=11), The treatment group with 1 mg/kg/day (n=11), The treatment group with 3 mg/kg/day (n=11), The treatment group with 10 mg/kg/day (n=11), n is the rat number. Experiment method: The in vivo pharmacodynamic activity of Crystal Form I of the present invention was evaluated by the hypertension and kidney injury Dahl/ss rat's model. One week before the experiment, the blood pressures of rats were monitored twice by the tail-cuff blood pressure measurement so that the rats could accommodate the blood pressure monitoring operation. The blood pressures of rats were monitored once before starting the experiment and used as the basic blood pressures before administration. The rats were randomly divided into groups according to the measured blood pressures before administration. The model was established by feeding the rats with a high salt chow (AIN-93G experiment animal feed containing 4% NaCl) for 42 days, in which the rats were freely accessible to food and water. And rats in control group were fed with a low-sodium chow. The rats in the treatment groups with Crystal Form I of the present invention were respectively administrated with Crystal Form I of the present invention in a dosage of 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day. Rats in treatment groups were dosed orally via gavage twice a day by 5 mL/kg. The rats in the model group and in the normal control were administrated with the same volume of sterile water for injection. Blood pressure (systolic blood pressure, abbreviated as SBP) measurement: The blood pressure was measured once each week for six weeks. The blood pressure changes were analyzed for each group. The pathological examinations for kidney and heart: After the experiment, the rats were killed in a painless manner. The heart and the bilateral kidneys were collected for histopathology analysis. Kidney injury was scored and semi-quantitatively analyzed based on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain. The heart injury was analyzed by the measurement of left ventricular wall thickness.
