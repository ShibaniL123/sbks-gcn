This application is a 371 of PCT/JP2012/054092, filed Feb. 21, 2012. Priority to Japanese patent application 2011-038496, filed Feb. 24, 2011, is claimed. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a polycarbonate polymer, a coating liquid using the same, an electrophotographic photoreceptor, and a manufacturing method of a polycarbonate copolymer. BACKGROUND ART A polycarbonate resin has been used as a material for molded products in various industrial fields because of its excellent mechanical characteristics, thermal characteristics and electrical characteristics. Recently, the polycarbonate resin has often been used in a field of a functional product requiring optical characteristics of the polycarbonate resin as well as the above characteristics. In accordance with such an expansion in application, the polycarbonate resin has been demanded to have a variety of performance. The functional product is exemplified by an electrophotographic photoreceptor in which the polycarbonate resins are used as a binder resin for functional materials such as a charge generating material and a charge transporting material. The electrophotographic photoreceptor has been demanded to have a predetermined sensitivity, electrical characteristics and optical characteristics in accordance with electrophotography process to be applied. A surface of a photosensitive layer of the electrophotographic photoreceptor is repeatedly subjected to operations such as corona electrification, toner development, transfer onto paper, cleaning and the like. Electrical and mechanical external-forces are applied on the surface of the photosensitive layer every time such operations are performed. Accordingly, the photosensitive layer provided on the surface of the electrophotographic photoreceptor is required to have durability against these external forces in order to maintain electrophotography image quality for a long period of time. Moreover, since the electrophotographic photoreceptor is typically manufactured by dissolving a functional material and a binder resin in an organic solvent and film-casting the obtained solvent on a conductive substrate and the like, the electrophotographic photoreceptor is required to have solubility in the organic solvent and stability of the obtained solvent. Traditionally, a polycarbonate resin using, for instance, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane (bisphenol A) and 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane (bisphenol Z) as an ingredient have been used as a binder resin for an electrophotographic photoreceptor. However, such a polycarbonate resin is insufficient to satisfy durability such as wear resistance. In view of the above, various techniques have been used in response to such demands. A copolymerized polycarbonate has been known as one of effective techniques (see, for instance, Patent Literatures 1 to 3). A resin disclosed in Patent Literature 1 includes a polycarbonate copolymer manufactured by copolymerizing a component having a biphenol skeleton that contributes to wear resistance with a component having a bisphenol Z skeleton that contributes to solubility. This polycarbonate copolymer is proved to have a wear resistance superior to that of a bisphenol-Z polycarbonate homopolymer. Patent Literature 2 discloses an alternating copolymer of bisphenol A and biphenol as a polymer in which a copolymerization ratio of biphenol is increased using a raw material in which the number of monomer units in an oligomer is reduced. The copolymerization ratio of biphenol contained in the alternating copolymer is 50 mol %. Patent Literature 3 discloses a polycarbonate copolymer having 60 mol % of a copolymerization ratio of biphenol in the polycarbonate copolymer. Patent Literature 4 discloses technique for manufacturing a bischloroformate compound by reacting, for instance, bisphenol A and bisphenol Z with phosgene. CITATION LIST Patent Literatures Patent Literature 1: JP-A-4-179961 Patent Literature 2: JP-A-5-70582 Patent Document 3: International Publication No. WO2010-150885 Patent Literature 4: JP-A-8-27068 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention In the aforementioned polycarbonate copolymer disclosed in Patent Literature 1, a content of a biphenol component, which contributes to improvement in wear resistance, is approximately 23 mol % at most. This is because oligomers (ingredient) having a chloroformate group at a molecule end are specifically a dimer, a trimer and a tetramer. In order to increase the content of the biphenol component, an attempt has been made to manufacture an oligomer of biphenol by the method described in Patent Literature 1. However, an undissolved component is deposited to cause failure in synthesis of the oligomer. Moreover, when a bisphenol Z monomer and biphenol are mixed to manufacture a polycarbonate copolymer, a solution in which the obtained polycarbonate copolymer is dissolved is unfavorably whitened. Since the polymer carbonate resin disclosed in Patent Literature 2 is not terminated, the polymer has a highly polar and highly reactive group (e.g. an OH group and a chloroformate group) at ends. For this reason, when the polycarbonate resin is used as, for instance, a binder resin of the electrophotographic photoreceptor, the polycarbonate resin unfavorably degrades a functional material to be mixed together or deteriorates electrical characteristics. In the polycarbonate copolymer disclosed in Patent Literature 3, when the copolymer has 47 mol % or more of the molar copolymer composition as defined in the invention, a reduced viscosity is decreased. Moreover, in such a composition, it is found that a ratio of a hydroxyl group at all chain ends of the polycarbonate is more than 20 mol %. On the other hand, Patent Literature 4 only discloses that a bischloroformate compound is usable as an ingredient for a polycarbonate, but fails to disclose a structure of the polycarbonate resin. An object of the invention is to provide: a polycarbonate copolymer exhibing excellent solubility in an organic solvent, electrical characteristics and wear resistance; a coating liquid using the polycarbonate copolymer; an electrophotographic photoreceptor; and a manufacturing method of the polycarbonate copolymer.

When the aromatic ring is substituted by two or more of R1 or R2 (p1, p2≧2), R1 and R2 are optionally different. [12] A coating liquid according to a further aspect of the invention includes: the polycarbonate copolymer according to the above aspect of the invention; and an organic solvent. [13] A coating liquid according to a still further aspect of the invention includes: the polycarbonate copolymer manufactured by the manufacturing method according to the above aspect of the invention; and an organic solvent. [14] An electrophotographic photoreceptor according to a still further aspect of the invention includes a conductive substrate and a photosensitive layer on the conductive substrate, the photosensitive layer including the polycarbonate copolymer according to the above aspect of the invention as a component. [15] An electrophotographic photoreceptor according to a still further aspect of the invention includes a conductive substrate and a photosensitive layer on the conductive substrate, the photosensitive layer including the polycarbonate copolymer manufactured by the manufacturing method according to the above aspect of the invention as a component. According to the above aspect of the invention, the polycarbonate copolymer includes, as a repeating unit, a unit derived from an oligomer having a small number of monomer units of a divalent aromatic compound and a unit derived from a monomer having a skeleton different from that of the above divalent aromatic compound, and has a molar copolymer composition represented by Ar1/(Ar1+Ar2) in a range of 50 mol % to 67 mol %. With this arrangement, the polycarobonate polymer has different characteristics of both Ar1 and Ar2. Moreover, with an average repeating number of an Ar1 block in a range of 1.0 to 1.99, the polycarobonate polymer can prevent disadvantages (e.g. decrease in solubility in accordance with increase in crystallinity) particularly caused by the presence of the repeating units of a plurality of Ar1. For instance, the polycarbonate copolymer, which includes, as a repeating unit, a unit derived from an oligomer having a small number of monomer units of a divalent aromatic compound having a skeleton contributing to wear resistance and a unit derived from a monomer having a skeleton contributing to a high solubility, keeps a high solubility and stability to an organic solvent. Accordingly, a coating liquid using the polycarbonate copolymer is not whitened but is transparent. When the polycarbonate copolymer is used as a binder resin of a photosensitive layer of an electrophotographic photoreceptor, the electrophotographic photoreceptor is excellent in wear resistance. Moreover, according to the above aspect of the invention, the polycarbonate copolymer includes, as a repeating unit, a unit derived from an oligomer having a small number of monomer units of a divalent aromatic compound, a unit derived from an oligomer having a small number of monomer units of a divalent aromatic compound having a skeleton different from that of the above divalent aromatic compound, and a unit derived from a monomer of the oligomer, and has a molar copolymer composition represented by Ar1/(Ar1+Ar2+Ar3) in a range of 47 mol % to 67 mol %. With this arrangement, the polycarobonate polymer has different characteristics of Ar1, Ar2 and Ar3. Moreover, with an average repeating number of an Ar1 block in a range of 1.0 to 1.99, the polycarobonate polymer can prevent disadvantages (e.g. decrease in solubility in accordance with increase in crystallinity) particularly caused by the presence of the repeating units of a plurality of Ar1. For instance, the polycarbonate copolymer, which includes, as a repeating unit, a unit derived from an oligomer having a small number of monomer units of a divalent aromatic compound having a skeleton contributing to wear resistance, a unit derived from an oligomer having a small number of monomer units of a divalent aromatic compound having a skeleton different from that of the above divalent aromatic compound, and a unit derived from the monomers, keeps a high solubility and stability to an organic solvent. Accordingly, a coating liquid using the polycarbonate copolymer is not whitened but is transparent. When the polycarbonate copolymer is used as a binder resin of a photosensitive layer of an electrophotographic photoreceptor, the electrophotographic photoreceptor is excellent in wear resistance. Further, the polycarbonate copolymer according to the above aspect of the invention is terminated at chain ends. A ratio of a hydroxyl group at all the chain ends is 20 mo % or less. With this arrangement, when the polycarbonate copolymer is used as, for instance, a binder resin for an electrophotographic photoreceptor, the electrophotographic photoreceptor exhibits excellent electrical characteristics. According to the manufacturing method of the polycarbonate copolymer in the above aspect of the invention, the polycarbonate copolymer having 20 mol % or less of the ratio of the hydroxyl group at all the chain ends can be stably manufactured. DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S) A polycarbonate copolymer (hereinafter, simply referred to as a “PC copolymer”) according to exemplary embodiments of the invention, a coating liquid using the PC copolymer, and an electrophotographic photoreceptor using the coating liquid will be described in detail below. Structure of PC Copolymer A PC copolymer according to this exemplary embodiment is configured to have a repeating unit represented by the following formula (100), in which a molar copolymer composition represented by Ar1/(Ar1+Ar2) is in a range of 50 mol % to 67 mol %, a reduced viscosity [ηsp/C] of the PC copolymer is in a range of 0.60 dl/g to 4.0 dl/g, and a ratio of a hydroxyl group at all ends is 20 mol % or less. In the formula (100), Ar2 represents a divalent group having an aromatic group. Ar1 is a group represented by the following formula (2). Chain ends are terminated by a monovalent aromatic group or a monovalent fluorine-containing aliphatic group. n represents an average repeating number of an Ar1 block and is a numeral of 1.0 to 1.99. Ar1 and Ar2 are not the same. In the formula, R1 and R2 each represent a halogen atom, a trifluoromethyl group, an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted aryloxy group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms, or a substituted or unsubstituted arylalkyl group having 7 to 20 carbon atoms. p1 and p2 each are an integer of 0 to 4. When the aromatic ring is substituted by two or more of R1 or R2 (p1, p2≧2), the two or more of R1 or R2 may be different groups. Moreover, the PC copolymer according to this exemplary embodiment is configured to have a repeating unit represented by the following formula (1), in which a molar copolymer composition represented by Ar1/(Ar1+Ar2+Ar3) is in a range of 47 mol % to 67 mol %, a reduced viscosity [ηsp/C] of the PC copolymer is in a range of 0.60 dl/g to 4.0 dl/g, and a ratio of a hydroxyl group at all the ends is 20 mol % or less. In the formula (1), Ar2 and Ar3 each represent a divalent group having an aromatic group. Ar1 is a group represented by the following formula (2). Chain ends are terminated by a monovalent aromatic group or a monovalent fluorine-containing aliphatic group. n represents an average repeating number of an Ar1 block and is a numeral of 1.0 to 1.99. m represents an average repeating number of an Ar3 block and is a numeral of 1.0 to 4.0. Ar2 and Ar3 may be the same or different. However, Ar1 is not the same as Ar2 and Ar3. In the formula, R1 and R2 each represent a halogen atom, a trifluoromethyl group, an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted aryloxy group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms, or a substituted or unsubstituted arylalkyl group having 7 to 20 carbon atoms. p1 and p2 each are an integer of 0 to 4. When the aromatic ring is substituted by two or more of R1 or R2 (p1, p2≧2), two or more of R1 or R2 may be different substituents. Examples of a halogen atom forming R1 and R2 are a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom and a bromine atom. Examples of the alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms which forms R1 and R2 are a linear or branched alkyl group. Examples of the linear or branched alkyl group are a methyl group, an ethyl group, propyl groups, butyl groups, pentyl groups and hexyl groups. Also, the alkyl group may be a cyclic alkyl group such as a cyclohexyl group. Further, a part or an entirety of the hydrogen atom in the alkyl group may be substituted by a halogen atom. Examples of other substituents are a trifluoromethyl group, an aryl group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms and an aryloxy group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms. Examples of the alkyl group forming the substituents are the same groups as the above. Examples of the aryl group forming the substituents are the following groups. The substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms which forms R1 and R2 is exemplified by a phenyl group. The above groups are examples for the aryl group and the alkyl group which form the alkoxy group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, the substituted or unsubstituted aryloxy group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms, and the substituted or unsubstituted arylalkyl having 7 to 20 carbon atoms, which form R1 and R2. When the aryl group, the aryloxy group or the arylalkyl group has a substituent in R1 and R2, for instance, the substituent may be an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of other substituents are a halogen atom and a trifluoromethyl group. p1 and p2 each are an integer of 0 to 4, preferably 0 or 1. The phrase that “chain ends are terminated by a monovalent aromatic group or a monovalent fluorine-containing aliphatic group” does not mean that all the chain ends of the polycarbonate copolymer in the exemplary embodiment are terminated by a monovalent aromatic group or a monovalent fluorine-containing aliphatic group. In the PC copolymer of the exemplary embodiment, since it is important to set a reduced viscosity representing a molecular weight within a predetermined range, an amount of a terminal terminator to be used is restricted. For this reason, it is difficult to eliminate all the OH groups at the ends as shown in Examples of the invention. The PC copolymer is typically manufactured by forming an Ar1 block and then reacting the Ar1 block with a monomer having Ar2 and Ar3 blocks and a monovalent aromatic group or a monovalent fluorine-containing aliphatic group. Accordingly, an average repeating number n does not become a numeral of 1.0 or less. On the other hand, when the average repeating number n exceeds 1.99, the Ar1 block becomes long to be crystallized and whitened in a solution, so that the PC copolymer becomes undissolved, which is a crucial disadvantage in use. Accordingly, n needs to be favorably in a range of 1.0 to 1.99. This is because the structure represented by the formula (2) is easily crystallized. On the other hand, although the details will be described later, since the Ar3 block is unlikely to be crystallized, m only needs to be adjusted to 0 or in a range of 1.0 to 4.0. Herein, the formula (100) represents a case where no Ar3 block is used in the formula (1). When the Ar3 block is used, the average repeating number m of the Ar3 block is not a numeral of 1.0 or less. On the other hand, when Ar3 has a skeleton having a relatively high crystallinity, m of more than 4.0 causes the Ar3 block to be crystallized, resulting in deteriorating solubility and transparence of the solution. Accordingly, when the PC copolymer containing the Ar3 block with m of more than 4.0 is used, for instance, as a coating liquid, disadvantages such as whitening possibly occur. When this PC copolymer is used as a binder resin for an electrophotographic photoreceptor, wear resistance is possibly decreased. In the PC copolymer of the exemplary embodiment including the repeating unit described in the formula (100), Ar1/(Ar1+Ar2) (i.e., the content of Ar1) is in a range of 50 mol % to 67 mol %, preferably of 50 mol % to 65 mol %. In the PC copolymer of the exemplary embodiment including the repeating unit described in the formula (1), the content of Ar1 represented by Ar1/(Ar1+Ar2+Ar3) is in a range of 47 mol % to 67 mol %, preferably of 47 mol % to 65 mol %, more preferably of 47 mol % to 62 mol %. When the content of Ar1 exceeds 67 mol %, crystallization of the copolymer proceeds to generate a phenomenon that the copolymer becomes undissolved in an organic solvent. Accordingly, the copolymer containing the content of Ar1 of more than 67 mol % is not suitable as a binder resin for an electrophotographic photoreceptor. When the content of Ar1 is less than 47 mol %, wear resistance of the PC copolymer is decreased. Accordingly, it becomes difficult to provide a copolymer having all the characteristics of Ar1, Ar2 and Ar3. In the PC copolymer of the exemplary embodiment including the repeating unit described in the formula (1), particularly when the content of Ar1 is less than 50 mol %, the PC copolymer can keep a content ratio of a skeleton contributing to solubility at a predetermined level or more by containing the Ar3 block, so that solubility of the PC copolymer can be reliably kept and stability of the solution can be enhanced. When the PC copolymer is manufactured only using an oligomer having the At1 skeleton and having 1.0 to 1.99 of the monomer units, the content of Ar1 in the polymer can be 50 mol % or more, but cannot be 50 mol % or less. Simultaneous use of an oligomer having the Ar3 skeleton enables to decrease a ratio of the Ar1 skeleton in the oligomer having a chloroformate group, thereby achieving the content of Ar1 of less than 50 mol %. The aforementioned mol % is a value obtained when a molar copolymer composition represented by Ar1/(Ar1+Ar2+Ar3) is represented by percentage. n and m respectively representing the average repeating numbers of Ar1 and Ar3 can be easily calculated based on the respective molar copolymer compositions. In the PC copolymer including the repeating unit described in the formula (100), n is automatically determined based on the molar composition ratio of Ar1 in Ar1/(Ar1+Ar2). In the PC copolymer of the exemplary embodiment including the repeating unit described in the formula (1), it is necessary to calculate molar ratios of Ar1 and Ar3 to determine the average repeating numbers n and m in view of 13C-NMR analysis results and the number of the monomer units of the oligomer. In a solution where the PC copolymer of exemplary embodiment is dissolved in a solvent of methylene chloride at a concentration of 0.5 g/dl, the PC copolymer exhibits reduced viscosity [ηSP/C] at 20 degrees C. in a range of 0.60 dl/g to 4.0 dl/g, more preferably in a range of 0.70 dl/g to 3.0 dl/g, particularly preferably of 0.90 dl/g to 2.0 dl/g. When the reduced viscosity [ηSP/C] is less than 0.60 dl/g, wear resistance of the PC copolymer may be insufficient in use as the electrophotographic photoreceptor. When the reduced viscosity [ηSP/C] is more than 4 dl/g, a coating viscosity of the PC copolymer may become too high for manufacturing a molded product (the electrophotographic photoreceptor and the like) from a coating liquid, so that productivity of the electrophotographic photoreceptor may be unfavorably lowered. The PC copolymer of the exemplary embodiment has a ratio of a hydroxyl group in all the chain ends (all the ends) (hereinafter, also referred to as “OH terminal ratio”) of 20 mol % or less, preferably 10 mol % or less, more preferably 8 mol % or less. When the OH terminal ratio exceeds 20 mol %, volume and sensitivity are unfavorably decreased in use as the binder resin for the electrophotographic photoreceptor. It should be noted that the lower limit of the OH terminal ratio is not particularly determined, but the smaller OH terminal ratio is preferable. The lower limit achievable by improving the manufacturing method of the PC copolymer is about 0.01 mol %. In the formulae (100) and (1), Ar2 and Ar3 only need to be a divalent aromatic group different from Ar1. In the formula (1), Ar1 and Ar2 may be similar groups or different groups. However, when Ar1 is different from Ar2 and Ar3 in the fundamental structure, the PC copolymer may preferably exhibit synergistic effects derived from the respective groups. On the other hand, when Ar2 and Ar3 are the same group in the fundamental structure, only two fundamental structures exist in the manufactured PC copolymer, thereby facilitating understanding and controlling of polymer characteristics. When the PC copolymer including the repeating unit described in the formula (100) or (1) is used particularly as a binder resin for an electrophotographic photoreceptor, the PC copolymer needs to have both solubility and wear resistance. Accordingly, Ar2 and Ar3 are preferably structured to contribute to solubility. In view of the above, Ar2 and Ar3 are preferably a divalent aromatic group represented by at least one of the following formulae (3) and (4). Particularly, in the formula (3), n0 is preferably 1.

The repeating unit number n0 is in a range of 0 to 2. R3, p3 and X2 in the repeating unit can be selected at each unit. When the aromatic ring is substituted by two or more R3 or R4 (p3, p4≧2), the two or more R3 or R4 may be different substituents. When the aromatic ring is substituted by two or more R5 (p5≧2), the two or more R5 may be different substituents.

In the formula (3), R3 and R4 are preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms or a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms.

These groups enable to provide more favorable wear resistance and electrical characteristics to the PC copolymer of the exemplary embodiment. In view of enhancement in solubility, X2 is preferably —CR6R7— in which R6 and R7 each independently represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a trifluoromethyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkylidene group having 5 to 12 ring carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted adamantane-2,2-diyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted adamantane-1,3-diyl group, and a substituted or unsubstituted α,ω-alkylene group having 2 to 12 carbon atoms.

Preferably, the divalent group is bonded thereto at 2,7-position, 2,6-position, 1,4-position or 1,5-position. R5 is preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. These groups enable to provide more favorable wear resistance and electrical characteristics to the PC copolymer of the exemplary embodiment. Although the structures represented by the formulae (3) and (4) are unlikely to be crystallized, Ar3 in the formula (1) is preferably the group represented by the formula (3) to the group represented by the formula (4) since the Ar3 block is more unlikely to be crystallized. Moreover, in the formulae (100) and (1), Ar2 is also preferably the group represented by the formula (3). Further, n0 is preferably 1 in the formula (3). Moreover, it is preferable in terms of improvement in wear resistance that the examples of the divalent aromatic group as Ar2 further include a divalent organic siloxane modified phenylene group. The divalent organic siloxane modified phenylene group is exemplified by a group represented by the following formula (3A).

R21 and R22 are preferably a hydrogen atom or an alkoxy group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms. More preferably, R21 and R22 have the following specific structure. R23 is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms or a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms. Examples of the substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms and the substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms are the same as the groups exemplified in the above description for R1 and R2. A phenyl group and a methyl group are preferable among the examples. n1 is an integer of 2 to 4. n2 is an integer of 1 to 600. The divalent organic siloxane modified phenylene group may be a group represented by the following formula (3B). Although the groups represented by the formulae (3A) and (3B) improve wear resistant at the same level, an organic siloxane modified phenol compound (a material for a PC copolymer) containing the group represented by the formula (3A) is more easily available. In the formula (3B), R31 independently represents a halogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms or a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms. A chlorine atom is preferable as the halogen atom.

A phenyl group and a methyl group are preferable among the examples. R33 represents a monovalent hydrocarbon group having no aliphatic unsaturated bond, the monovalent hydrocarbon being the same or different. Examples of the monovalent hydrocarbon group are a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms and a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms.

Preferably, a is 0 or 1. In the electrophotographic photoreceptor by using the PC copolymer as a binder resin, surface energy is reduced by further including the divalent organic siloxane modified phenylene group as Ar2, thereby reducing a possibility of extraneous substances adhering. Specifically, extraneous substances such as toner are prevented from adhering to the electrophotographic photoreceptor. Specific examples of the divalent organic siloxane modified phenylene group are as follows. In the above formulae, the number (n) of the repeating units of an organic siloxylene group is preferably in a range of 1 to 600, more preferably of 10 to 300, particularly preferably of 20 to 200, most preferably of 30 to 150. When n is 600 or less, compatibility with the PC copolymer becomes favorable to complete the reaction in polymerization step. Accordingly, an unreacted organic siloxane modified phenol compound is prevented from remaining in the final PC copolymer, whereby the resin is not whitened to restrain increase in residual potential of the electrophotographic photoreceptor in use as a binder resin. On the other hand, when n is 1 or more, surface energy is sufficiently given to the electrophotographic photoreceptor, which favorably prevents adhesion of extraneous substances. A ratio of the divalent organic siloxane modified phenylene group in the PC copolymer is in a range of 0.01 mass % to 50 mass %, preferably of 0.1 mass % to 20 mass %, more preferably of 0.5 mass % to 10 mass %, most preferably of 1 mass % to 6 mass %. In the ratio of 0.1 mass % or more, adhesion of foreign substances can be more favorably prevented. With the ratio of 50 mass % or less, the PC copolymer exhibits excellent wear resistance and sufficient mechanical strength and is favorably used as the electrophotographic photoreceptor. Chain ends are terminated by a monovalent aromatic group or a monovalent fluorine-containing aliphatic group. The monovalent aromatic group may be a group containing an aromatic group. The monovalent fluorine-containing aliphatic group may be a group containing an aromatic group. The phrase “chain ends are terminated by a monovalent aromatic group or a monovalent fluorine-containing aliphatic group” means that a monomer having one reaction group (e.g., a COOH group and an OH group) reacts with a polycarbonate chain to form a chain end as described later in relation to a terminal terminator. The aromatic group at the chain end is preferably a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms. Examples of the aryl group are a phenyl group and a biphenyl group. The group containing the aromatic group is exemplified by a substituted or unsubstituted alkylaryl group having 7 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of a substituent to be bonded to the aromatic group and the alkyl group bonded to the aromatic group are halogen atoms such as a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom and a bromine atom. The substituent bonded to the aromatic group is exemplified by an alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms. This alkyl group may be a group bonded by a halogen atom as described above and a group bonded by an aryl group. The monovalent fluorine-containing aliphatic group at the chain end is exemplified by a fluorine-containing alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms. When the monovalent aromatic group is at the chain end, the monovalent aromatic group may be an organic siloxane modified phenyl group. The monovalent organic siloxane modified phenyl group is exemplified by a group represented by the following formula (3C). In the formula, Z represents a hydrocarbon group having 2 to 6 carbon atoms. Z is preferably an alkylene group, more preferably, a methylene group having 2 to 4 repeating units. R41 represents an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. R41 is preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. R42 to R45 independently represent hydrogen, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms and a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms. R46 to R49 independently represent a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms and a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms. Examples of the substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms and the substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms are the same as the groups exemplified in the above description for R1 and R2. A phenyl group and a methyl group are preferable among the examples. n is an integer of 2 to 600 and represents an average number of repeating units in case of molecular weight distribution. Examples of the monovalent organic siloxane modified phenyl group are as follows. In the electrophotographic photoreceptor using the PC copolymer having the monovalent organic siloxane modified phenyl group as a binder resin, adhesion of extraneous substances such as toner can be reduced. A ratio of the monovalent organic siloxane modified phenyl group, the ratio being required for expressing the above effects, is in a range of 0.01 mass % to 50 mass % relative to the entire PC copolymer. The ratio of the monovalent organic siloxane modified phenyl group is more preferably in a range of 0.1 mass % to 20 mass %, particularly preferably of 0.5 mass % to 10 mass %. In the PC copolymer containing a unit derived from the divalent organic siloxane modified phenyl group in the main chain in addition to the monovalent organic siloxane modified phenyl group, this unit is added up together. The PC copolymer according to this exemplary embodiment is obtainable by reacting a bischloroformate oligomer having a small number of monomer units represented by the following formula (5) or both the bischloroformate oligomer having a small number of the monomer units represented by the formula (5) and a bischloroformate oligomer represented by the following formula (6) with a divalent phenol compound (a comonomer) represented by the following formula (7) and a monovalent phenol compound (a terminal terminator) in the presence of a base calculated according to stoichiometry. Use of such an oligomer and the base content calculated according to stoichiometry in the reaction enables the average repeating number of the Ar1 block to be in a range of 1.0 to 1.99 and the reduced viscosity [ηsp/C] to be in a range of 0.60 to 4.0 dl/g, thereby facilitating manufacturing the PC copolymer having a ratio of a hydroxyl group at all the ends of 20 mol % or less. In the formulae, Ar1 is a group represented by the formula (2). Ar2 and Ar3 are a divalent group having an aromatic group. Ar2 and Ar3 may be the same or different. However, Ar1 is not the same as Ar2 and Ar3. n′ is a numeral of 1.0 to 1.99. n″ is 0 or a numeral of 1.0 to 4.0. Herein, n′ representing the average number of the monomer units of the bischloroformate oligomer is different from n in the formulae (1) and (100). In comparison between n and n′, n is typically larger than n′ as shown in Examples below. This is because, when the manufactured bischloroformate oligomer in which the Ar1 block is formed reacts with a monomer including Ar2 and chain ends, the chloroformate group at the end of the Ar1 oligomer may react with the base present in the reaction system to form a hydroxyl group, resulting in polycondensation of the hydroxyl group with another Ar1 oligomer having chlorine at its end. n″ representing the average number of the monomer units of the bischloroformate oligomer is also different from m in the formula (1). In the bischloroformate oligomer of the formula (5), the average number of the monomer units if is in a range of 1.0 to 1.99. n′ is favorably in a range of 1.0 to 1.70. In the bischloroformate oligomer of the formula (6), the average number of the monomer units n″ is 0 or in a range of 1.0 to 4.0. Herein, the phrase that “n” is 0″ means that the bischloroformate oligomer of the formula (6) is not to be used. The average number of the monomer units is favorably in a range of 1.0 to 3.0. The PC copolymer according to this exemplary embodiment is easily manufactured by using the bischloroformate oligomer having the average number of the monomer units in the above range. A method for calculating the average number of the monomer units is exemplified by a method described later in Examples. The material including the bischloroformate oligomer represented by the formulae (5) and (6) may occasionally contain an amide compound as an impurity. A content of the amide compound is calculated based on a mass of nitrogen atoms contained in the material including the bischloroformate oligomer. When the solvent is removed from the solution including the material to obtain solids, the content of the amide compound (the mass of nitrogen derived from the amide compound) is 700 mass ppm or less, preferably 400 mass ppm or less, more preferably 150 mass ppm or less, particularly preferably 80 mass ppm or less based on the total mass of the material including the bischloroformate oligomer. When the content of the amide compound is 700 mass ppm or less, increase in residual potential of the electrophotographic photoreceptor can be restrained when the PC copolymer is used as a binder resin for the electrophotographic photoreceptor. The bischloroformate oligomer may be liquid as well as solids. Examples of the amide compound are N,N,N′,N′-tetraalkyl urea, N,N-dialkylcarbamate chloride such as N,N-diethylcarbamate chloride, N,N-dialkylcarbamate, a polymer of bisphenol-monochloroformate-monoalkylcarbamate and bisphenol-bisdialkylcarbamate. When a large amount of an amine compound such as triethylamine is used for manufacturing the bischloroformate oligomer, the amine compound and the bischloroformate compound react with each other to occasionally form the amide compound as impurities. However, as described above, the content of the amide compound can be decreased by increasing the number of times for cleaning the bischloroformate oligomer. In addition to water-cleaning, distillation, an adsorbent and column fractionation are applied for reducing the content of the amide compound. The PC copolymer obtained using the material including the bischloroformate oligomer may also occasionally contain dialkylcarbamate chloride such as diethylcarbamate chloride as impurities. In this case, the content of dialkylcarbamate chloride is 100 mass ppm or less, preferably 50 mass ppm or less, more preferably 40 mass ppm or less based on the total mass of the PC copolymer. When the content of dialkylcarbamate chloride is 100 mass ppm or less, increase in residual potential is restrained to provide an electrophotographic photoreceptor having a favorable sensitivity. Manufacturing Method of PC Copolymer The manufacturing method of the PC copolymer according to this exemplary embodiment is exemplified by polycondensation of a bischloroformate oligomer derived from a divalent phenol compound represented by the following formula (15) and, as needed, the formula (16) and a divalent phenol compound represented by the following formula (17) and having a skeleton different from that of the above divalent phenol compound in the presence of a phenol compound or fluorine-containing alcohol compound for terminating the chain end group. [in-line-formulae]HO—Ar1—OH (15)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]HO—Ar3—OH (16)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]HO—Ar2—OH (17)[/in-line-formulae] As the bischloroformate oligomer to be used in the PC copolymer according to the exemplary embodiment, the bischloroformate oligomer derived from the formula (15) may be used alone, or a bischloroformate co-oligomer derived from the formulae (15) and (16) may be used. Further, the bischloroformate oligomers respectively derived from the formulae (15) and (16) may be blended. However, when the molar copolymer composition represented by Ar1/(Ar1+Ar2+Ar3) in the PC copolymer according to the exemplary embodiment is 50 mol % to 67 mol %, the bischloroformate oligomer derived from the formula (15) is singularly used, but the bischloroformate oligomer derived from the formula (16) or the bischloroformate co-oligomer derived from the formulae (15) and (16) are not typically used. Ar2 and Ar3 may be the same or different. However, Ar1 is not the same as Ar2 and Ar3. The monomer represented by the formula (15) (divalent phenol compound) is exemplified by a biphenol compound. Specific examples of the biphenol compound are 4,4′-biphenol, 3,3′-dimethyl-4,4′-biphenol, 3,3′,5-trimethyl-4,4′-biphenol, 3-propyl-4,4′-biphenol, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl-4,4′-biphenol, 3,3′-diphenyl-4,4′-biphonol and 3,3′-dibutyl-4,4′-biphenol. Among the above examples, 4,4′-biphenol and 3,3′-dimethyl-4,4′-biphenol are preferable.

More preferable examples are 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenyl ethane, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane, 2,2-bis(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, 1,1-bis(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane, 1,1-bis(3-methy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclododecane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)adamantane, and 9,9-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)ether. The PC copolymer according to this exemplary embodiment is obtainable by conducting interfacial polycondensation and the like using the monomer represented by the formula (17) and either the bischloroformate oligomer obtained from the formula (15) or a combination of the bischloroformate oligomer obtained from the formula (15) and the bischloroformate oligomer obtained from the formula (16). When an interfacial polycondensation is conducted under the presence of an acid binding agent with use of various carbonyl dihalides such as phosgene, diphosgene and triphosgene, carbonate ester bonding can be favorably formed. In the interfacial polycondensation, it has been conventionally considered that a required amount of the acid binding agent is 1 equivalent or more per 1 mol of total hydroxyl groups of the monomer of the formula (17), preferably from 1 equivalent to 10 equivalents. However, it has been found that a mol number of the bischloroformate oligomer needs to be considered in order to stably manufacture the PC copolymer. It is effective to estimate a use ratio of the acid binding agent for stably manufacturing the PC copolymer so that a value X of the acid binding agent falls in a range of 1.1 to 1.3, the value X being calculated according to the following calculation formula (Numerical Formula 1) in consideration of stoichimetric proportion in the reaction. In the following formula (Numerical Formula 1), the mole number of the bischloroformate oligomer is represented by Mc (mol), a mole number of the divalent phenol monomer is represented by Mp (mol), a mole number of the acid binding agent is represented by Mo (mol), and a valence of the acid binding agent is represented by Y. [in-line-formulae]X=Mo·Y/(2Mc−2Mp) (Numerical Formula 1)[/in-line-formulae] When the value X of the acid binding agent exceeds 1.3, the bischloroformate oligomer derived from the formula (15) representing the material of the PC copolymer according to the exemplary embodiment is highly possible to be easily decomposed by the acid binding agent to be crystallized. When the value X is less than 1.1, polymerization does not proceed due to shortage of the acid binding agent, so that the reduced viscosity of the PC copolymer is not increased. Moreover, due to a poor polymerization, highly polar and highly reactive groups (e.g., OH group) excessively remain at the ends of the PC copolymer. For instance, when the PC copolymer is used as a binder resin for an electrophotographic photoreceptor, such groups are likely to deteriorate electric characteristics. Accordingly, the value of the acid binding agent of 1.1 to 1.3 is effective for stably promoting polymerization. The above reaction(s) is conducted under the presence of a terminal terminator and/or a branching agent as needed. Moreover, in manufacturing the PC copolymer according to this exemplary embodiment, two or more kinds of monomers derived from Ar2 may be used to provide a multicomponent copolymer. As the terminal terminator for terminating the chain end, monovalent carboxylic acid and derivatives thereof, and monovalent phenol are usable. For instance, p-tert-butyl-phenol, p-phenyl-phenol, p-cumylphenol, p-perfluoro nonylphenol, p-(perfluoro nonyl phenyl)phenol, p-(perfluorohexyl)phenol, p-tert-perfluorobutyl phenol, perfluorooctyl phenol, 1-(p-hydroxybenzyl)perfluorodecane, p-[2-(1H,1H-perfluorotridodecyloxy)-1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro propyl]phenol, 3,5-bis(perfluoro hexyloxy carbonyl)phenol, p-hydroxy perfluoro dodecyl benzoate, p-(1H,1H-perfluoro octyloxy)phenol, 2H,2H,9H-perfluoro nonane acid, 1,1,1,3,3,3-tetraphloro-2-propanol, or alcohols represented by the following formulae (18) and (19) are preferably used. [in-line-formulae]H(CF2)nCH2OH (18)[/in-line-formulae] (n is an integer of 1 to 12.) [in-line-formulae]F(CF2)mCH2OH (19)[/in-line-formulae] (m is an integer of 1 to 12.) A ratio at which the terminal terminator is added is in a range of 0.05 mol % to 30 mol % per the copolymer composition, more preferably of 0.1 mol % to 10 mol %. When the ratio is more than 30 mol %, mechanical strength may be deteriorated. When the content is less than 0.05 mol %, moldability may be deteriorated. Examples of the branching agent are phloroglucin, pyrogallol, 4,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-heptene, 2,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-heptene, 2,4-dimethyl-2,4,6-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)heptane, 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzene, 1,3,5-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzene, 1,1,1-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)phenylmethane, 2,2-bis[4,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]propane, 2,4-bis[2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propyl]phenol, 2,6-bis(2-hydroxy-5-methylbenzyl)-4-methylphenol, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propane, tetrakis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane, tetrakis[4-(4-hydroxyphenyl isopropyl)phenoxy]methane, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, trimesic acid, cyanuric acid, 3,3-bis(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindole, 3,3-bis(4-hydroxyaryl)oxyindole, 5-chloroisatin, 5,7-dichloroisatin and 5-bromoisatin. An additive amount of the branching agent is preferably 30 mol % or less per the copolymer composition, more preferably 5 mol % or less. When the additive amount is more than 30 mol %, moldability may be deteriorated. Examples of the acid binding agent usable in interfacial polycondensation are: alkaline metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxides, lithium hydroxides and cesium hydroxide; alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as magnesium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; carbonates such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate; and organic bases such as trialkylamines (triethylamine, trimethylamine and tripropylamine), N-methyl morpholine, tetramethylethylenediamine, triethylenediamine, diazabicycloundecene, dimethylaniline, diethylaniline, dipropylaniline and pyridine. Among these, alkaline metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxides and alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as calcium hydroxide, and amine compounds such as triethylamine, dimethylaniline and diethylaniline are preferable. These acid binding agents can be used in mixture. Preferable examples of the solvent to be used herein are: aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene and xylene; halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, 1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane, 1,1,2,2,-tetrachloroethane, pentachloroethane and chlorobenzene; ketones such as cyclohexaneone, acetone and acetophenone; and ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-dioxane. One of the above solvents may be singularly used, or two or more of the above may be used together. With use of two solvents that are not miscible with each other, interfacial polycondensation may be conducted. Preferable examples of a catalyst are: tertiary amines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, tributylamine, N,N-dimethylcyclohexyl amine, pyridine, N,N-diethyl aniline and N,N-dimethyl aniline; quaternary ammonium salts such as trimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, triethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, tributyl benzyl ammonium chloride, trioctyl methyl ammonium chloride, tetrabutyl ammonium chloride and tetrabutyl ammonium bromide; and quaternary phosphonium salts such as tetrabutyl phosphonium chloride and tetrabutyl phosphonium bromide. Further, a small amount of an antioxidant such as sodium sulfite and hydrosulfite salt may be added to the reaction system as needed. The manufacturing method of the PC copolymer according to this exemplary embodiment is specifically applicable in various embodiments. For instance, the bischloroformate oligomer represented by the formula (5) is manufactured by reacting the biphenol compound represented by the formula (15) with phosgene, and then the manufactured bischloroformate oligomer is reacted with the monomer represented by the formula (17) in the presence of a mixture of the above solvent and an alkali aqueous solution (the acid binding agent). This method is preferable in that n in the formulae (100) and (1) is adjustable to a preferable range. The following method of manufacturing the bischloroformate oligomer represented by the formula (15) is preferable in that a cleaning process in manufacturing the polycarbonate copolymer can be simplified. A manufacturing method of the bischloroformate oligomer having n′ in the formula (5) in a range of 1.0 to 1.99 is exemplified by the following manufacturing method. Firstly, the biphenol compound of the formula (15) is suspended in a hydrophobic solvent such as methylene chloride and then added with phosgene to form a mixed solution. On the other hand, a tertiary amine such as triethylamine is dissolved in a hydrophobic solvent such as methylene chloride to form a solution. The solution is dropped into the above mixed solution for reaction, preferably, at the room temperature or less. Hydrochloric acid and deionized water are added to the obtained reactant mixture to be cleaned. An organic layer including a polycarbonate oligomer having a small number of monomer units is obtained. Alternatively, after the hydrophobic solvent is removed from the obtained reactant mixture to some extent, hydrochloric acid and deionized water may be added to be cleaned. A reaction temperature is typically in a range of 0 to 70 degrees C. under cooling, preferably of 5 to 40 degrees C. Both dropping time and reaction time are in a range of 15 minutes to 4 hours, preferably of 30 minutes to about 3 hours. The bischloroformate oligomer thus obtained preferably has an average number of monomer units (n′) in a range of 1.00 to 1.99, more preferably of 1.00 to 1.70. The divalent phenol monomer having a different skeleton and represented by the formula (17) is added to an organic phase containing the bischloroformate oligomer thus obtained having a small number of monomer units to be reacted. The reaction temperature is 0 to 150 degrees C., preferably 5 to 40 degrees C., particularly preferably 10 to 25 degrees C. A reaction pressure may be any one of a reduced pressure, a normal pressure and an added pressure. Typically, the reaction can be favorably performed under a pressure that is approximately equal to the normal pressure or a self-pressure of the reaction system. The reaction time, which is dependant on the reaction temperature, is typically in a range of 0.5 minute to 10 hours, preferably of 1 minute to 3 hours. In the reaction, the divalent phenol monomer represented by the formula (17) is desirably added in a form of an aqueous solution or an organic-solvent solution. The order of the addition is not specifically limited. In the above manufacturing method, the catalyst, the terminal terminator, the branching agent and the like may be added as needed at the time of manufacturing a bischloroformate oligomer or at the time of subsequent polymerization reaction, or both at the time of manufacturing the bischloroformate oligomer and at the time of subsequent polymerization reaction. When the PC copolymer contains the bischloroformate oligomer obtained from the formula (16), for instance, the bisphenol compound represented by the formula (16) is reacted with phosgene to manufacture the bischloroformate oligomer represented by the formula (6) and having a small number of monomer units. Subsequently, applicable is a method in which this bischloroformate oligomer having a small number of the monomer units and the bischloroformate oligomer obtained from the formula (15) and having a small number of the monomer units are mixed, and then the mixture is reacted with the monomer represented by the formula (17) in the presence of a mixture of the above solvent and the alkali aqueous solution of the above acid binding agent. In the manufacturing of the PC copolymer according to the exemplary embodiment, the bischloroformate oligomer obtained from the formula (16) preferably has the average number of the monomer units n″ in a range of 1.0 to 4.0. Since the material obtained from the formula (16) may be hydrolyzed by alkali depending on polymerization conditions, n″ is more preferably in a range of 1.0 to 3.0. The manufacturing method of the above oligomer is exemplified by the following manufacturing examples. Firstly, the bisphenol compound of the formula (16) is suspended in a hydrophobic solvent such as methylene chloride and then added with phosgene to form a mixed solution. On the other hand, a tertiary amine such as triethylamine is dissolved in a hydrophobic solvent such as methylene chloride to form a solution. The solution is dropped into the above mixed solution for reaction, preferably, at the room temperature or less. Hydrochloric acid and deionized water are added to the obtained reactant mixture for cleaning. An organic layer including a bischloroformate oligomer having a small number of the monomer units is obtained. Alternatively, after the hydrophobic solvent is removed from the obtained reactant mixture to some extent, hydrochloric acid and deionized water may be added for cleaning. A reaction temperature is typically in a range of 0 to 70 degrees C. under cooling, preferably of 5 to 40 degrees C. Both dropping time and reaction time are in a range of 15 minutes to 4 hours, preferably of 30 minutes to about 3 hours. The bischloroformate oligomer thus obtained preferably has an average number of monomer units (n″) in a range of 1.0 to 4.0, more preferably of 1.00 to 3.00, particularly preferably of 1.00 to 1.99. It should be noted that n″ never exceeds 4.0 according to this manufacturing method. When the PC copolymer is manufactured only using the bischloroformate oligomer having 1.0 to 1.99 of the monomer units represented by the formula (5) without using the bischloroformate oligomer represented by the formula (6), the content of Ar1 in the PC copolymer can be 50 mol % or more, but cannot be 50 mol % or less. By using the bischloroformate oligomer represented by the formula (6) at the same time, a ratio of the Ar1 skeleton near the chain ends may be decreased to make Ar1 less than 50%. The PC copolymer thus obtained is formed of the monomer units represented by the following formulae (20) to (22). According to this manufacturing method, the ratio of the hydroxyl groups at all the ends can be reliably made 20 mol % or less in the PC copolymer. It should be noted that n in the formula (20) is the same as n in the formula (100) or (1) and m in the formula (21) is the same as m in the formula (1). As long as an object of the invention is not hampered, the PC copolymer may contain a polycarbonate unit having a structure unit other than those of the formulae Ar1, Ar2 and Ar3 or a unit having a polyester structure or a polyether structure. For controlling the reduced viscosity [ηsp/C] of the obtained PC copolymer to be within the above-described range, various methods, such as a method of selecting the reaction conditions and a method of adjusting the use amount of the branching agent and the terminal terminator, are available. In addition, if necessary, the PC copolymer may be subjected to a physical treatment such as mixing and cutoff and/or a chemical treatment such as polymer reaction, cross linking or partial degradation, so that the PC copolymer having a predetermined reduced viscosity [ηsp/C] may be obtained. The obtained reaction product (crude product) may be subjected to various aftertreatments such as known separation and refinement, so that the PC copolymer having desirable purity (desirable refining degree) may be obtained. Structure of Coating Liquid A coating liquid according to this exemplary embodiment at least contains the PC copolymer according to this exemplary embodiment and a solvent capable of dissolving or dispersing the PC copolymer according to this exemplary embodiment. Moreover, in addition to the above, the coating liquid may contain a low molecular compound, a colorant such as a dye and a pigment, a functional compound such as a charge transporting material, an electron transporting material, a hole transporting material and a charge generating material, a filler such as an inorganic or organic filler, fiber and particles, and an additive such as an antioxidant, a UV absorbent and an acid scavenger. Materials that may be contained besides the resin are exemplified by materials contained in the components for the electrophotographic photoreceptor described later. The coating liquid may contain other resins as long as the advantages of this exemplary embodiment are not hampered. The coating liquid is exemplified by the following components of the electrophotographic photoreceptor. As the solvent usable in this exemplary embodiment, a single solvent may be used or a plurality of solvents may be used by mixture, considering solubility, dispersibility, viscosity, evaporation speed, chemical stability and stability against physical changes of the PC copolymer according to this exemplary embodiment and other material. The solvent is exemplified by the components of the electrophotographic photoreceptor described later. The solvent is exemplified by a later-described solvent to be used for forming the charge generating layer and the charge transporting layer. The concentration of the copolymer component in the coating liquid is sufficient when the coating liquid can exhibit a viscosity suitable for usage. The concentration is preferably in a range of 0.1 mass % to 40 mass %, more preferably of 1 mass % to 35 mass %, most preferably of 5 mass % to 30 mass %. When the concentration exceeds 40 mass %, coating performance is deteriorated due to excessively high viscosity. When the viscosity is less than 0.1 mass %, the coating liquid may flow away due to excessively low viscosity, so that a uniform film cannot be obtained. For drying the obtained film, long time may be required due to excessively low concentration of the coating liquid, so that a desired thickness of the film may not be obtained. The PC copolymer according to this exemplary embodiment has a good compatibility with the charge transporting material and is not whitened or gelled even when dissolved in the solvent. Accordingly, the coating liquid according to this exemplary embodiment containing the copolymer, the charge transporting material and the solvent can be stably stored without whitening or gelation of the polymer components over a long period of time. When a photosensitive layer of the electrophotographic photoreceptor is formed with use of the coating liquid, an excellent electrophotographic photoreceptor having no defect on an image without crystallization of the photosensitive layer is obtainable. A ratio of the PC copolymer to the charge transporting material in the coating liquid is typically 20:80 to 80:20 by mass, preferably 30:70 to 70:30 by mass.

[in-line-formulae]Ar1/(Ar1+Ar2)=n/(n+1) (Numerical Formula 4)[/in-line-formulae] Manufacturing of Coating Liquid and Electrophotographic Photoreceptor A film of polyethylene terephthalate resin on which aluminum metal was deposited was used as a conductive substrate. A charge generating layer and a charge transporting layer were sequentially laminated on the surface of the conductive substrate to form a laminate sensitive layer, thereby providing an electrophotographic photoreceptor. 0.5 parts by mass of oxotitanium phthalocyanine was used as a charge generating material while 0.5 parts by mass of a butyral resin was used as a binder resin. The charge generating material and the binder resin were added into 19 parts by mass of methylene chloride (solvent) and dispersed with a ball mill. Then, the dispersion was applied onto the surface of the conductive-substrate film and dried, thereby providing a charge generating layer having a film thickness of approximately 0.5 μm. Next, for use as a charge transporting material, 0.5 g of a compound (CTM-1) represented by the following formula (23) and 0.5 g of the obtained polycarbonate copolymer (PC-1) were dispersed in 10 ml of tetrahydrofuran to prepare a coating liquid. The coating liquid was applied onto the charge generating layer with an applicator and dried, thereby providing a charge transporting layer having a film thickness of approximately 20 μm. Evaluation of PC Copolymer and Electrophotographic Photoreceptor Solubility of the PC copolymer was evaluated by visually checking whitening degree of the prepared coating liquid when the coating liquid was prepared. A case where the PC copolymer was dissolved to show no whitening was marked as A, a case where the PC copolymer was partially undissolved was marked as B, and a case where the PC copolymer was whitened was marked as C. Wear resistance of the PC copolymer and the electrophotographic photoreceptor was evaluated as follows. (1) Sample preparation for evaluation on wear resistance of the copolymer: PC-1 (2 g) was dissolved in methylene chloride (12 mL) and the obtained solution was cast into film on a commercially available PET film using an applicator. This film was heated under reduced pressure and a solvent was removed to obtain a film sample having a thickness of about 30 μm. (2) Sample preparation for evaluation on wear resistance of the photoreceptor: PC-1 (1 g) and CTM-1 (1 g) were dissolved in methylene chloride (10 mL) and the obtained solution was cast into film on a commercially available PET film using an applicator. This film was heated under reduced pressure and a solvent was removed to obtain a film sample having a thickness of about 30 μm. (3) Evaluation: wear resistance of cast surfaces of the films manufactured at (1) and (2) process was evaluated using a Suga wear test instrument NUS-ISO-3 model (manufactured by Suga Test Instruments Co., Ltd.). Testing conditions: An abrasion paper having an alumina particle with a particle size of 3 μm was given a 4.9-N load. The sample was put into reciprocating motion 2000 times on the abrasion paper in contact with a surface of a photosensitive layer. A mass reduction of the sample was measured. The mass reduction of the film sample manufactured at the (2) process was evaluated as wear resistance of the electrophotographic photoreceptor. Next, electrophotographic characteristics of the obtained electrophotographic photoreceptor were measured using an electrostatic charge tester EPA-8100 (manufactured by Kawaguchi Electric Works Co., Ltd.). Specifically, corona discharge of −6 kV was conducted in the static mode. Then, a residual potential (initial residual potential (VR)) after five seconds of light irradiation (10 Lux) was measured. Further, a commercially available printer (FS-600, manufactured by Kyocera Corporation) was modified, which enabled to measure the surface potential of the photoreceptor. Then, the photoreceptor was mounted on a drum and evaluated in terms of electrification characteristics (repeating residual-potential increase (VR increase) before and after 24-hour-consecutive operation under conditions of high temperature and high humidity (35 degrees C., 85%) not through a toner and a paper. The results are shown in Table 1. The following Examples 2 to 6 and Comparatives 1 to 3 were evaluated in the same manner. The results are also shown in Table 1.

Firstly, a copolymerization ratio of Ar1 was calculated from the 1H-NMR spectrum. Since Ar2 and Ar3 have the same skeleton, a copolymerization ratio of each of those cannot be calculated. Next, it was confirmed using 13C-NMR spectrum that Ar1 was not bonded to another Ar1 and Ar1 was formed of 1.00 monomer unit. In order to obtain the average number of the monomer units m of Ar3, firstly, an average number of monomer units m′ of Ar2 and Ar3 was calculated according the calculation formula (Numerical Formula 5) since Ar2 and Ar3 have the same skeleton. [in-line-formulae]Ar1/{Ar1+(Ar2+Ar3)}=1/(1+m′)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]Ar1/{Ar1+(Ar2+Ar3)}=1/(1+m′)=0.47[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]m′=0.53/0.47=1.12 (Numerical Formula 5)[/in-line-formulae] Further, the average number of the monomer units m of Ar3 was calculated according to the following formula. [in-line-formulae]m′=(mole number of Ar2×average number of monomer units of Ar2)+mole number of Ar3×m/(mole number of Ar2+mole number of Ar3)[/in-line-formulae] In the above formula, when the mole number of Ar2 was set at 0.074, the mole number of Ar3 was set at 0.012, and the average number of the monomer units of Ar2 was set at 1.0 since Ar2 was derived from a monomer, the average number of the monomer units m of Ar3 was 1.85 Example 4 A PC copolymer (PC-4) was manufactured in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the monomer material was replaced by 1.49 g of 4,4′-dihydroxydiphenyl ether.

In comparison between Examples 1 to 6 and Comparatives 1 to 3, the PC copolymers of Examples 1 to 6 were found to have a small mass reduction and an extremely excellent wear resistance in the wear resistance evaluation since the PC copolymers of Examples 1 to 6 exhibited a favorable reduced viscosity, a stable solubility to the organic solvent and an extremely small ratio of OH ends in all the ends.

On the other hand, in Comparative 1, the PC copolymer exhibited a low reduced viscosity and a poor solubility due to crystallization of the PC copolymer, and the electrophotographic photoreceptor exhibited poor wear resistance, electrical characteristics and electrification characteristics because the mass reduction in the wear resistance evaluation was large and both of the initial residual potential and the repeating residual potential were large. In Comparatives 2 and 3, since the PC copolymers exhibited a large ratio of OH ends in all the ends, it was found that the electrophotographic photoreceptor had poor wear resistance, electrical characteristics and electrification characteristics because the mass reduction in the wear resistance evaluation was large and both of the initial residual potential and the repeating residual potential were large.
