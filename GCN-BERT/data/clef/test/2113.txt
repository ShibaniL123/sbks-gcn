(Synthesis of compound 11 (MLN-COOH)
The compound 10 (240.8 mg, 0.58 mmol) was charged into an eggplant flask, and 5 mL of dichloromethane was added. This was stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes, and then 5 mL of TFA was added, and stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. After evaporating the solvent under reduced pressure, vacuum drying was performed to obtain a compound 11 (MLN-COOH) (214.7 mg, 0.59 mmol, 100%).
