TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to partially fluorinated sulfinic acids and salts thereof and methods of making. BACKGROUND In the polymerization of fluoromonomers, traditionally the monomers are added to a kettle along with an initiator, to initiate the polymerization, as well as a solvent, and in the case of aqueous emulsion polymerization, the polymerization is carried out in water and typically in the presence of an emulsifier in order to stabilize the emulsion. Fluorinated sulfinic acids and their salts have been used to initiate polymerization. The fluorinated sulfinic acids and their salts have been used along with oxidizing agents during polymerization of fluoromonomers as a means for achieving perfluorinated end groups, which may offer the advantages of more stability, improved performance, etc. by reducing or eliminating the less stable polar end-groups. As disclosed in Grootaert (U.S. Pat. No. 5,285,002), the fluorinated sulfinic acid or salt thereof reacts with an oxidizing agent to generate a fluorinated alkyl radical via electron transfer, which then initiates the polymerization of monomers. Various papers have described how to prepare fluorinated sulfinic acids or their salts by reduction of sulfonyl fluoride with different reducing agents or by dehalosulfination reaction from fluorinated halides. Examples of different reducing agents used to reduce a sulfonyl fluoride are NH2NH2 as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,950,317 (Brown et al.), M2SO3 and NaBH4 as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,285,002 (Grootaert), and K2SO3 as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,837 (Farnham et al.). Examples of a dehalosulfination reaction from fluorinated halides are described by Huang et al. in Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, vol. 23 (1983) p. 193-204 and p. 229-240; by Huang et al. in Chinese Journal of Chemistry, vol. 9 (1991) p. 351-359, and Fan-Hong et al., in Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, vol. 67 (1994) 233-234.

In another embodiment, the addition of a concentrated acid, such as, for example, sulfuric acid, is added to protonate the sulfinate salt resulting in a phase split. In another embodiment, the crude product is isolated by the addition of an acid, such as, for example, sulfuric acid, followed by extraction with an organic solvent, such as t-butyl methyl ether and diethyl ether. The desired product in acid form then is isolated by removal of the organic solvent. In some embodiments further purification of the crude product is sometimes not necessary.

The monomer of the present disclosure, may be used in polymerizations of fluoropolymers. Because one end of the monomer according to formula I comprises a double bond, the monomer may be used in polymerization reactions. Because the other end of the monomer according to formula I comprises a sulfinic acid or salt thereof, this site is able to form a radical and act as an initiator in polymerization reactions. Therefore, the monomer according to formula I may be consumed during a polymerization. Furthermore, because of the sulfinic acid end group, polymers made using this initiator may have reduced or no amounts of polar end-groups, which may aid in stability of the polymer.

Example 1 Part I In a 600 mL PARR pressure reactor, commercially available from Parr Instruments Inc., Moline, Ill., 45 g I—CF2CF2OCF2CF2SO2F (0.10 mol) was reacted with 3.0 g CH2═CH2 (0.107 mol) in the presence of 0.70 g Initiator in 80 g perfluorinated N-methyl morpholine solvent at 67° C. with a pressure of no higher than 75 psi (517 kPa) for 24 hours. 19F-NMR analysis of the reaction solution indicated that 76% ICH2CH2CF2CF2OCF2CF2—SO2F (−120 ppm for —CH2CF2—, t, J=16.5 Hz) was formed with 24% unreacted I—CF2CF2OCF2CF2SO2F (−57 ppm for ICF2—). Only the 1/1 adduct was formed. 19F NMR showed chemical shifts at +43 ppm for —SO2F, −82 and −88 ppm for CF2OCF2—, −114 ppm for CF2SO2— and −120 ppm for —CH2CF2—. Chemical shifts from 1H NMR for ICH2CH2— were correspondingly at 3.5 (t, 2H) and 2.5 (m, 2H) ppm. Part II The crude reaction solution from above containing ICH2CH2CF2CF2OCF2CF2SO2F was treated with an excess of DBU at room temperature for 4 hours. 19F NMR analysis showed no effect on the —SO2F group, and the triplet of CF2CH2— was changed into doublet×triplet at 121 ppm (Jd=7.8 Hz, Jt=3.6 Hz), indicating the desired reaction occurred to yield CH2═CHCF2CF2OCF2CF2SO2F. Addition of water to dissolve DBU/HI solid, and the bottom perfluorinated N-methyl morpholine solution was isolated. From F-NMR, no more I—CF2CF2OCF2CF2SO2F was observed in the isolated solution. The solution was dried over MgSO4. After filtration and rotary evaporation to remove the solvent, 22 g product was obtained (89% isolated yield; bp=115-116° C.). 19F NMR showed the chemical shifts at +43 ppm (—SO2F), −83.8 ppm (m, —CF2O—), −89.2 ppm (txt, —CF2O—), −114 ppm (dxt, —CF2SO2F) and 120 ppm (dxt, —CF2CH═). Also, H1 NMR confirmed the formation of CH2═CH— with chemical shift at 5.7˜6.3 ppm (m). Part III 20 g of CH2═CH2CF2CF2OCF2CF2SO2F from Part II above was dissolved in 20 g THF and put into an additional funnel, which was added dropwise to a dispersion solution of 4.20 g NaBH4 in 70 g THF over the course of 30 minutes at 0° C. under nitrogen while stirring. Then the reaction solution was allowed to warm and was reacted at 20° C. for 4 hours. 19F NMR showed all SO2F (+42 ppm) was reacted. The corresponding CF2SO2F signal at −114 ppm was not observed and a corresponding new signal of CF2SO2Na at −131 ppm was observed in support the formation of CH2═CHCF2CF2OCF2CF2SO2Na. The extra NaBH4 was removed by reaction with water. Then, the solution was acidified with 2N H2SO4 aqueous solution to a pH<2. The acidified solution was extracted with t-BuOCH3 (three times with 60 mL each). The combined t-BuOCH3 solution was dried over MgSO4. The solution was then filtered to remove solids and then placed on a rotary evaporator to remove solvent. 15 g product was isolated (corresponding to a 79% yield). 19F NMR showed chemical shifts of −82 (m) and −87 (m) ppm for CF2OCF2—, −117 ppm (m) for CF2CH═ and −132 for CF2SO2H. 1H NMR showed chemical shift at 5.73 ppm (dxm, 1H) and 5.82-5.99 ppm (m, 2H) for the corresponding CH2═CH— group. Example 2 Part I In a 600 mL PARR pressure reactor, 223 g I(CF2)4I (MW=454, 0.491 mol) was reacted with 15.4 g CH2═CH2 (MW=28, 0.55 mol, charged in portions) in the presence of 4.58 g Initiator at 60° C. for 24 hours under 60 psi (414 kPa) or less. 19F NMR analysis of the reaction mixture showed 50% unreacted I(CF2)4I, 43% ICH2CH2CF2CF2CF2CF21 and 7% ICH2CH2CF2CF2CF2CF2CH2CH2I. Distillation of the reaction mixture at normal pressure recovered 70 g pure I(CF2)4I (31.4%) and 16.5 g of a mixture of I(CF2)4I and ICH2CH2CF2CF2CF2CF2I (MW=482). Distillation in vacuum, 79.1 g of ICH2CH2CF2CF2CF2CF2I (MW=482, which equates to about a 33.4% isolated yield) was isolated with boiling point of 88˜91° C./7˜7.5 mmHg GC (gas chromatography) analysis showed 95% purity. From the remaining solid residue, 12 g ICH2CH2CF2CF2CF2CF2CH2CH2I was isolated after purification by recrystallization from hexane (m.p. 96˜97° C.). 19F NMR for ICH2CH2CF2CF2CF2CF2I, −57 (m, —CF2I), −111 (m, 2F), −113 (m, 2F), and −121 (t, —CF2CH2—) ppm. Part II Under nitrogen, 50 g of the above distilled ICH2CH2CF2CF2CF2CF2I (MW=482, 95%, 0.1 mol) was treated with 26 g Na2S2O4 (MW=174, 91%, 0.136 mol) and 13 g NaHCO3 (MW=84, 0.154 mol) in 50 g CH3CN and 68 g H2O at room temperature for 2 hours. 19F NMR showed complete conversion of CF2I (−67 ppm) to form the corresponding CF2SO2Na at ˜−130 ppm yielding the desired ICH2CH2(CF2)4SO2Na. The mixture was filtered to remove solids. The filtered solution showed two phases, and only top phase showed fluorinated product based on 19F NMR analysis. The top phase was separated, and the solvents were removed by rotary evaporation to give 76.5 g wet solid. The wet solid was dissolved in water and the following chemical shifts were recorded, −115 (dxt), −122 (m), −124 (m) and −130 (dxt) ppm. No effect on ICH2CH2— was observed during the dehalosulfination based 1H NMR analysis (2.5-3 ppm multiplet for —CH2I and 3.2 ppm (txm) for —CH2CF2—). Part III The ICH2CH2(CF2)4SO2Na solid from part II above was dissolved in ethanol and treated with 8.7 g KOH (MW=56, 85%, 0.132 mol) at room temperature, then at 50° C. for 8 hours to precipitate a solid. The reaction mixture was cooled to 20° C. and filtered to remove solids. No significant change in 19F NMR was observed. The solvent was stripped and the resulting solid was acidified with 2N H2SO4 to a pH<2. The acidified solution was extracted with t-BuOMe (three times, 100 mL each) and the combined ether solution was dried over MgSO4. Finally, the solution was filtered and the solvent was stripped to yield 28 g of the desired semisolid product, CH2═CH(CF2)4SO2H (MW=292), which is soluble in water. The structure of the product was confirmed by NMR analyses, 19F NMR, −115 (m, ═CHCF2—), −122 (txm), −125 (txm) and −130 (t, —CF2SO2H); 1H NMR, 4.4˜5.6 (m) ppm, indicating no more ICH2CH2— signal. However, ethanol residue was observed in final product, which can be eliminated by fully drying the solid before acidification from a repeated preparation. Example 3 Part I-a 95 g Br(CF2)4Br (MW=359.8, 0.26 mol) was reacted with CH2═CH2 in the presence of 2.2 g Initiator in a 200 mL PARR pressure reactor at 77° C. for 20 hours under 80 psi. Only 3.4 g CH2═CH2 was charged (MW=28, 0.12 mol). 19F NMR analysis of the reaction mixture showed 80% unreacted Br(CF2)4Br, 18% desired product, BrCH2CH2CF2CF2CF2CF2Br, and 2% BrCF2CF2CF2CF2H. Part I-b Similarly, 95 g Br(CF2)4Br (MW=359.8, 0.26 mol) was reacted with CH2═CH2 in the presence of 2.34 g Luperox TAEC in a 200 mL PARR pressure reactor at 90° C. under 90 psi for 20 hours. Totally 8 g CH2═CH2 was charged (MW=28, 0.33 mol). 19F NMR analysis of the reaction mixture showed ˜56 mol % unreacted BrCF2CF2CF2CF2Br, ˜39 mol % Br(CH2CH2)CF2CF2CF2CF2Br (n=1, 2), ˜3 mole % BrCH2CH2CF2CF2CF2CF2CH2CH2Br and 2 mole % BrCF2CF2CF2CF2H. Distillation at normal pressure gave 3.5 g mixture of BrCF2CF2CF2CF2H (˜20 mol %) and BrCF2CF2CF2CF2Br (80 mol %) at 63˜95° C., and 50.7 g recovered BrCF2CF2CF2CF2Br (19F NMR, −67 ppm and −120 ppm) at 90-99° C. Distillation in vacuum distillation gave 22.5 g desired product at 60˜65° C./9 mmHg (NMR purity 98%), and 12.7 g mixture of Br(CH2CH2)2CF2CF2CF2CF2Br and BrCH2CH2CF2CF2CF2CF2CH2CH2Br with the ratio of around 78 to 22 at 90° C./˜0.8 mmHg 19F NMR for BrCH2CH2CF2CF2CF2CF2Br, −67 (m, —CF2Br), −118 (m, 2F), −121 (m, 2F) and −126 (m, —CF2CH2—) ppm. 19F NMR for Br(CH2CH2)2CF2CF2CF2CF2Br, −67 (t, —CF2Br), −118 (m, 2F), −120 (m, 2F), and −126 (m, 2F) ppm. 19F NMR for BrCH2CH2CF2CF2CF2CF2CH2CH2Br, −118 (m, 2F) and −127 (m, 2F) ppm. Part II Under nitrogen, 20 g of the above distilled BrCH2CH2CF2CF2CF2CF2Br (MW=386, 0.051 mol) was treated with 12 g Na2S2O4 (MW=174, 91%, 0.062 mol) and 5.3 g NaHCO3 (MW=84, 0.063 mol) in 25 g CH3CN and 25 g H2O at 60° C. for 24 hours. 19F NMR showed complete conversion of —CF2Br (−67 ppm), and the corresponding —CF2SO2M signal at −130 ppm was appeared, indicating the formation of the desired BrCH2CH2(CF2)4SO2Na. The mixture was filtered to remove solids, and the solvents were removed by rotary evaporation to give 28 g wet solid, which was directly used for next HBr-elimination reaction Part III The above BrCH2CH2(CF2)4SO2Na solid was dissolved in 50 g ethanol and treated with 6.6 g KOH (MW=56, 85%, 0.10 mol) at room temperature, then at 55° C. for 2 hours to precipitate a solid. After the reaction mixture was cooled to 20° C., the mixture was filtered to remove solids. The solvent was stripped and the resulting solid was acidified with 2N H2SO4 to pH<2. The acidified solution was extracted with t-BuOMe (3×60 mL) and the combined ether solution was dried over MgSO4. Finally, the dried solution was filtered and the solvent was stripped to yield 13.0 g of the desired semisolid product, CH2═CH(CF2)4SO2H (MW=292, ˜95% purity based on NMR analysis and ˜82% isolated yield based on BrCH2CH2CF2CF2CF2CF2Br), which is soluble in water.
