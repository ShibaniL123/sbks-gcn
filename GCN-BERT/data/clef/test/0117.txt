TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to endotracheal tubes such as, for example, orotracheal tubes and nasotracheal tubes. BACKGROUND A tracheal tube is typically a catheter that is inserted into the trachea for the purpose of providing an airway for a patient. An endotracheal tube is a specific type of tracheal tube that is inserted through the mouth (orotracheal) or nose (nasotracheal). Such endotracheal tubes are in contrast to a tracheostomy tube, which is inserted into a tracheostoma following a tracheostomy procedure, and a tracheal button, which may also be inserted into a puncture through the paratracheal skin into the trachea. An endotracheal tube may be cuffed or uncuffed. Cuffed endotracheal tubes include a cuff that can be inflated to minimize the passage of secretions from the upper respiratory tract downward into the lungs of a patient. One problem with cuffed endotracheal tubes is the pooling of saliva and other secretions around the inflated cuff and the potential for such secretions to leak past the cuff and into the lungs.

DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS While the concepts of the present disclosure are susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific exemplary embodiments thereof have been illustrated by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the concepts of the present disclosure to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Referring now particularly to FIGS. 1 and 1a, an endotracheal tube system 10, here an orotracheal tube system, includes an outer cannula 12 for insertion through the mouth of a wearer 20, down the wearer 20's pharynx 24, through the wearer 20's glottis 22 and into the wearer 20's trachea 18. Outer cannula 12 includes an inflatable cuff 16. Cuff 16 lies in the trachea 18 of the wearer 20 below the wearer 20's glottis 22. Outer cannula 12 also includes a first port 26 which resides outside the mouth of the wearer 20 during use and a second port 28 which resides inside the trachea 18 of the wearer 20 below cuff 16 during use. The cuff 16 is inflatable through a conduit 30 once the outer cannula 12 is in place in the trachea 18 to minimize the passage of secretions 32 from the upper respiratory tract downward into the lungs of the wearer 20. Such secretions 32 pool above the cuff 16 (that is, on the side of the cuff 16 opposite the lungs) when the cuff 16 is inflated in place. The construction of the cuff 16 as a sleeve 42, FIG. 5, with its upper and lower ends 44, 46, respectively, tucked under, rather than extending beyond the cuff 16 up and down the outer sidewall of the outer cannula 12, is aided by the use of thin-walled material for the cuff 16. In an alternative embodiment, illustrated in FIG. 5a, only upper end 44′ is tucked under, rather than extending beyond the cuff 16 up the outer sidewall of the outer cannula 12′. The constructions illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 5a provide certain benefits which will be discussed subsequently. The outer cannula 12 includes (a) fenestration(s) 56. Although two such fenestrations 56 are illustrated, it should be understood that any number of fenestrations 56 may be provided in the outer cannula 12 for this purpose. The construction of cuff 16, with its doubled-over upper and lower ends 44, 46, respectively, (FIG. 5) or doubled-over upper end 44′ (FIG. 5a), permits location of the fenestration(s) 56 low (that is, more toward the lungs of the wearer 20) on the outer cannula 12. The proximity of the cuff 16 to the fenestration(s) 56 also provides some additional protection of the tissue of the trachea 18 against irritation and damage occasioned by contact with the edges of the fenestration(s) 56 by virtue of the standoff provided by the inflated cuff 16. Referring now particularly to FIGS. 1 and 3, an inner cannula 60 is inserted into the lumen 62 of the outer cannula 12. To evacuate pooling secretions 32, a conduit 70 extends down the sidewall of inner cannula 60. Conduit 70 terminates at an open end 72 at the bottommost extent of fenestrations 56 to expose the secretions 32 to suction at open end 72 of tube 70 provided by a suction source 73 at the outer end of inner cannula 60. Owing to the construction of cuff 16 with its doubled-under end 44, this location generally coincides with the top of the cuff 16 at the bottommost extent of fenestration 56. Owing to this construction, extraction of secretions 32 is somewhat more predicable and complete. In addition, it is contemplated that replacement of the inner cannula 60 may occur more frequently and with less difficulty and without much of the trauma that might attend replacement of outer cannula 12, which is typically placed in the trachea for a longer term. Typically, both the outer 12 and inner cannulae 60 are constructed from suitable filled and/or unfilled resin(s) and/or polymer(s). Inner cannula 60 typically can be relatively straightforwardly replaced by disconnecting it from the ventilator 74 (illustrated diagrammatically) to which the outer end 76 of inner cannula 60 is attached in use and withdrawing inner cannula 60 from outer cannula 12. Because of the relative ease with which inner cannula 60 can be removed, disposed of if appropriate, and replaced with a fresh cannula 60 having a fresh tube 70, providing tube 70 on inner cannula 60 rather than on outer cannula 12 affords somewhat more reliable patency of tube 70 than if the tube 70 were to be provided in outer cannula 12 which, as noted above, is typically not so readily removed for cleaning or replacement. Referring now to FIG. 1, the inner cannula 60 is releasably fixed to an outer cannula 12 by one or more (two in the illustrated embodiment) locking tabs 100 which may be formed with, and from the same material as, the coupler 76 of cannula 60 by which cannula 60 is coupled to the ventilator 74. The tabs 100 are flexibly formed or mounted to the coupler 76 of inner cannula 60. The tabs 100 are provided with engaging surfaces 106. A coupler 108 is provided at the proximal end 54 of outer cannula 12. The coupler 108 includes a notch 114 for receiving the portion of each tab 100 which extends beyond engaging surfaces 106 and portions 116 for capturing engaging surfaces 106. This configuration also promotes correct orientation of inner cannula 60 with the fenestration(s) (56 in FIG. 1) of outer cannula 12 when inner cannula 60 is inserted into outer cannula 12. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a digital pressure gauge 304 is inserted into the conduit 30 between a fitting 302 and cuff 16 by a fitting 306 provided on gauge 304. Fitting 302 is configured complementarily to a fitting on a source 307 of compressed air, such as a syringe. Such a fitting might be, for example, a Luer lock fitting or other suitable fitting to couple the compressed air source to fitting 302 for this purpose. Fitting 302 may also include a one-way valve of a suitable type, such as, for example, a ball valve, to prevent the escape of cuff 16-inflating air, permitting the compressed air source 307 to be disconnected from fitting 302 once cuff 16 is inflated to a suitable pressure. The schematic and block circuit diagram descriptions that follow identify specific integrated circuits and other components and in many cases specific sources for these. Specific terminal and pin names and numbers are generally given in connection with these for the purposes of completeness. It is to be understood that these terminal and pin identifiers are provided for these specifically identified components. It is to be understood that this does not constitute a representation, nor should any such representation be inferred, that the specific components, component values or sources are the only components available from the same or any other sources capable of performing the necessary functions. It is further to be understood that other suitable components available from the same or different sources may not use the same terminal/pin identifiers as those provided in this description. The gauge 304 removed from its housing 305 is illustrated in FIGS. 6a-c. An electrical schematic of gauge 304 is illustrated in FIGS. 7a-e. As illustrated in FIGS. 1, 2, 6a, 6b and 7a, gauge 304 includes a two digit (seven segments each) liquid crystal display (LCD) 310 which illustratively is a Glory Sound (Asia) Ltd., AE359 type DS-M2684-F display. Referring to FIGS. 6b and 7b, the driver 312 for display 310 illustratively is a Freescale Semiconductor MC9S08QB4QFN microcontroller (μC). Pins 1-4, the Vdd, Vrefh, Vrefl and Vss terminals, respectively, of driver 312 are coupled to the gauge 304's +Vbat, +Vbat, common and common terminals, respectively. Vrefh is coupled to +Vbat through a 1.8 μH inductor. +Vbat and common are the + and − terminals, respectively, of, for example, a 3V lithium PC 2 pin mount, 170 mAh coin cell 313 such as, for example, a Renata SA type 614-CR2025FH-MFR-LF coin cell. See FIGS. 6a-c. Referring again to FIG. 7b, the parallel combination of a 2.2 μF capacitor and a 100 nF capacitor is coupled across pins 1 and 4 of μC 312. The parallel combination of a 2.2 F capacitor and a 100 nF capacitor is coupled across pins 2 and 3. Pins 5-24, terminals PB7/EXTL, PB6/XTL, PBS, PB4, PC1, PC0, PB3/AD7, PB2/AD6, PB1/TXD/AD5, PB0/RXD/AD4, PA7, PA6, PA3/AD3, PA2/AD2, PA1/AD1, PA0/AD0, PC7, PC6, PA5/*RST, and PA4/BKGD, respectively, of driver 312 are coupled to LCD COM, LCD segment 1G, LCD segment 1F, LCD segment 1E, LCD segment 2B, LCD segment 2A, LCD segment 1D, LCD segment 1C, LCD segment 1B, LCD segment 1A, LCD segment 2G, LCD segment 2F, LCD segment 2E, not connected, the gauge 304's TEMPerature terminal, the gauge 304's NET_PRESSure terminal, LCD segment 2D, LCD segment 2C, through a 100 nF capacitor to gauge 304's common terminal, and through a 4.7 KΩ resistor to +Vbat. Another 4.7 KΩ resistor is coupled between pin 23 of driver 312 and +Vbat. Referring to FIGS. 6b, 6c and 7c, pressure at port 306, which is the cuff 16 inflation pressure, is monitored by a pressure sensor 320, illustratively a Freescale Semiconductor type MPX10 or MPX12 uncompensated silicon pressure sensor. Sensor 320 pins 1-4 are coupled respectively to the gauge 304 common, through a 10 KΩ resistor to the non-inverting (+) input terminal, pin 3, of a differential amplifier 322, to gauge 304's+Vbat terminal, and through a 10 KO resistor to amplifier 322's inverting (−) input terminal, pin 2. Amplifier 322 illustratively is one-fourth of a National Semiconductor type LMC6464AIM quad differential amplifier. Feedback is provided from the output terminal, pin 1, of amplifier 322 to the − input terminal of amplifier 322 through a 100 KΩ resistor. Pin 4 of amplifier 322 is coupled to +Vbat. Pin 11 of amplifier 322 is coupled to common. The parallel combination of a 2.2 μF capacitor and a 100 nF capacitor is coupled across +Vbat and common. Pin 1 of amplifier 322 is coupled to a + terminal, pin 5 of a differential amplifier 324. An output terminal, pin 7, of amplifier 324 is coupled to amplifier 324's − input terminal, pin 6, configuring amplifier 324 as a unity gain buffer. Pin 7 of amplifier 324 forms the gauge 304's NET_PRESSure terminal. Amplifier 324 illustratively is one-fourth of a National Semiconductor type LMC6464AIM quad differential amplifier. Referring to FIG. 7d, a 10 KΩ, 1% thermistor 330, such as a Vishay type 71-TFPT1206L1002FV thermistor, and a 10 KΩ, 1% resistor are coupled in series between +Vbat and common. The common terminal of thermistor 330 and the 10 KΩ resistor is coupled to the + input terminal, pin 12, of a differential amplifier 332. An output terminal, pin 14, of amplifier 332 is coupled to amplifier 332's − input terminal, pin 13, configuring amplifier 332 as a unity gain buffer. Pin 14 of amplifier 332 forms the gauge 304's TEMPerature terminal. Amplifier 332 illustratively is one-fourth of a National Semiconductor type LMC6464AIM quad differential amplifier. Referring to FIGS. 6a, 6b and 7e, +Vbat is supplied to the illustrated circuitry through a suitable switch 334, such as a Snaptron dome switch. The topography of gauge 304 can best be understood by referring to FIGS. 6a-c, where the relative locations of fitting 306, LCD 310, driver 312, battery 313, pressure sensor 320 and switch 334 can be readily ascertained. Gauge 304 is configured to be reliable yet inexpensive in keeping with the philosophy that inner cannula 60 be rendered disposable. However, gauge 304 can be provided with a T-junction and conduit 30 and fitting 302 with appropriate complementary fittings, so that the T-junction can readily be disconnected from and reconnected into the conduit 30 between cuff 16 and fitting 302, should it be appropriate to retain the gauge 304 and dispose of the inner cannula 60. In such embodiments, gauge 304 could be reused as long as it remained operable. Referring now to FIG. 8, an endotracheal tube apparatus 410 is shown. In the illustrative embodiment, the endotracheal tube apparatus is an orotracheal apparatus configured for insertion through a patient's mouth and into his or her trachea. In other embodiments, the endotracheal tube apparatus may be a nasotracheal apparatus configured for insertion through a patient's nose. The apparatus 410 includes an outer cannula 412 and an inner cannula 414 sized to be selectively inserted into, and removed from, the outer cannula 412. The cannulae 412, 414 are formed as components from polyvinyl chloride but may also be formed from silicone or other suitable biocompatible material(s). The outer cannula 412 has a distal longitudinal end 416 and a proximal longitudinal end 418. A passageway or lumen 420 extends through ports 422, 424 defined in the ends 416, 418, respectively. The cannula 412 also has an outer surface 426 that extends between the ends 416, 418. As shown in FIG. 8, the outer surface 426 is devoid of any fenestrations or other openings. In the illustrative embodiment, an inflatable cuff 428 is provided on the outer surface 426 between the ends 416, 18. The cuff 428 is inflatable through a conduit 430 once the outer cannula 412 is in place in the trachea, as described in greater detail below. The inner cannula 414 is sized to be inserted into the lumen 420 of the outer cannula 412. The inner cannula 414 has a distal longitudinal end 436 and a proximal longitudinal end 438. A passageway or lumen 440 extends through ports 442, 444 defined in the ends 436, 438, respectively. The cannula 414 also has an outer surface 46 that extends between the ends 436, 438. As shown in FIG. 8, the outer surface 446 is devoid of any openings. In the illustrative embodiment, the inner cannula 414 may be coupled to a ventilator (not shown). The inner cannula 414 is releasably fixed to an outer cannula 412 via an attachment mechanism 448. In the illustrative embodiment, the attachment mechanism 448 includes one or more (two in the illustrated embodiment) couplers or locking tabs 450 that are flexibly formed or mounted to the proximal longitudinal end 438 of the inner cannula 414. The tabs 450 are provided with engaging surfaces 452. The attachment mechanism 448 also includes a coupler 454 at the proximal longitudinal end 418 of the outer cannula 412. The coupler 454 includes a notch 456 for receiving the portion of each tab 450 which extends beyond engaging surfaces 452 and portions 458 for capturing engaging surfaces 452. This configuration also promotes correct orientation of inner cannula 414 within outer cannula 412. In use, the endotracheal tube apparatus 410 is inserted through a patient's mouth 470, down the patient's pharynx 472, through the patient's glottis 474, and into the patient's trachea 476, as shown in FIG. 9. The port 424 at the proximal longitudinal end 418 of the outer cannula 412 is positioned outside the patient's mouth 470 during use and the port 422 at the distal longitudinal end 16 of the outer cannula 412 is positioned inside the trachea 476 below cuff 428 during use. As described above, the cuff 428 is inflatable through a conduit 30 once the outer cannula 412 is in place in the trachea 476 to minimize the passage of secretions 480 from the upper respiratory tract downward into the patient's lungs. Such secretions 480 pool above the cuff 428 (that is, on the side of the cuff 428 opposite the lungs) when the cuff 428 is inflated in place. As described above, the inner cannula 414 may be removed from the outer cannula 412. It is contemplated that replacement of the inner cannula 414 may occur more frequently and with less difficulty and without much of the trauma that might attend replacement of the outer cannula 412, which is typically placed in the trachea for a longer term. The inner cannula 414 typically can be relatively straightforwardly replaced by disconnecting it from the ventilator (if any), releasing the coupler(s) 450 and withdrawing the inner cannula 414 from the outer cannula 412. The inner cannula 414 thus can be removed, disposed of if appropriate, and replaced with a fresh cannula 414 with relative ease.
