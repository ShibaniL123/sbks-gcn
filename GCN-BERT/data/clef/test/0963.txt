A "! .'-",' f> f~ -, 4.CCT66 SPECIFICATION TO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: BE IT KNOWN THAT EDMUND V. BERTOLINI, a citizen of the United States, residing at Western Springs in the County of Cook and State of Illinois has invented certain new and useful Improve¬ ments in a PROCESS OF PREPARING FOOD PRODUCTS FOR MERCHANDIZING of which the following is a specification: My invention relates to the art of preserving and mer¬ chandizing food products, particularly fish, seafoods, meat, poultry and the like. Referring particularly tb the art of merchandizing fish, the present practice is to prepare fresh fish for distribution and sale to the consumer in the following manners. After being caught, whole fish are shipped, usually packed in ice, and sold in that manner; or, such fish may be refrigerated; that is, frozen in a sharp freezer and maintained in frozen condition until delivered for use; or, the fresh fish are processed to remove the edible portion in the form of fillets; in a subsequent treatment, the fillets may be quick-frozen or sharp frozen, packaged in consumer packages, or delivered in fresh unfrozen condition. Merchandizing in this manner involves some loss, since some of the parts of the fish that are otherwise «jt u *>' *' <! > v J wholesome and edible, but of small or irregular shape, are not adapted for sale as fillets and are disposed of as scrap. The large volume of sales of fish is in whole fish and in so-called "institutional" packages; that is, bnlk packages of five, ten or more pounds, composed of fillets or ready-to-cook pieces and frozen in bulk, the block being wrapped and refrigerat¬ ed and delivered in that manner to the users, whether it be a hotel, restaurant, school or other large public institution. How¬ ever, this form of merchandizing has disadvantages, particularly as applied to the small restaurants or retail stores, since, in order to use any part of a whole fish or of a block of fish, the entire fish or block must be defrosted and must be utilized within a reasonable time after defrosting, due to the relatively rapid deterioration of fish, even though stored at ordinary ice box temperature. This deterioration is noticeable in the rapid development of an odor, rather than actual spoilage. I have conceived and utilized a process in which the foregoing difficulties are eliminated. By my process I remove the entire edible portion of the fish and utilize such entire edible jportion without regard to the size or shape of the pieces. By ay process I treat the separated pieces of fish in a bath of egg x> i; -white or similar alb-umen substance, then press the so-treated ; pieces into a block and quick-freeze the block in available ; apparatus. The egg white acts as an adhesive to hold the pieces i [ together, particularly after defrosting. However, when the ||block has been removed from the freezer, it is separated by means i j[ of a band saw into regularly shaped pieces, say, two, three or ij jfour ounces, of a shape suitable for serving, and the so-formed pieces are again given a superficial coating of egg white and immediately rolled in an edible substance, such as potato meal, corn meal, cracker crumbs, etc., the coating adhering tightly to the albumen surface. Thereafter the so-prepared pieces are packed in boxes or cartons of appropriate size for sale. In use the retail dispenser has no problem of defrosting, since the pro¬ duct may be utilized in any required quantity without first de¬ frosting. For example, a restaurant chef need only remove the required number of pieces for an order - say two - from the pack¬ age, immediately place them in deep fat and french fry them, with a resulting firm cooked product ready to serve. The particular reason why the section composed of small pieces will be firm and not readily broken apart during and after cooking is in the use of the egg white or a similar substance that will not be liquified under heat; on the contrary, it will set at a comparatively low 41011 _. , | temperature. As a matter of fact, immediately upon placing the pieces in the hot fat, the exterior coating of egg white will set and as the heat penetrates the interior the coating for the | individual pieces will likewise set, thus adhesively joining all the pieces. The use of the albumen coating as a final dip for ttie pieces serves another important purpose; that of sealing in the flavors and juices and preventing dehydration over a compara¬ tively long period. There being a double coating of the egg white, first around the individual pieces and next around the formed pieces, the sealing is doubly effective. Of course, the act of dividing the block into small portions will expose a con¬ siderable area and this area is that which is covered and sealed by the second dipping process. All the instrumentalities used in carrying out the pro¬ cess are known, but in order to facilitate the matter of descrip¬ tion, such instrumentalities are illustrated diagrammatieally in the accompanying drawings; in which, Fig. 1 is a composite view showing a reticulated con¬ tainer for the small pieces of fish that have been separated from the bones and other inedible portions, and also showing a tank adapted to contain the edible dip; klOll b Fig. 2 is a fragmentary view of a freezing machine within which the dipped pieces are placed for quick freezing} Pig. 3 is a perspective view somewhat enlarged show¬ ing the "block of frozen fish as it comes from the freezing machine, the dotted lines in the figure indicating the lines of subdivi¬ sion of the blockj Fig. k shows one of the individual sections; Fig. 5 shows the same section after it has been again dipped and coated with a vegetable substance; and. Fig. 6 shows a package within which the coated pieces may be placed to adapt the product for sale. As a preliminary step, the whole fish is cut up in such a manner as to eliminate bones and other inedible parts, the resulting pieces, which will be of indefinite size and shape, being placed in a wire basket 10 and dipped in a tank 11 con¬ taining an edible substance that will set under heat, such as egg white or similar albumen material. After the pieces have been dipped and drained, the contents of the wire basket are dumped into a freezing machine, shown in Fig. 2. This machine, which may be that shown in the United States patent to Cooke No. l,6l1}-,455, comprises a series of hollow castings 12, a cover 13 and a support 1H-. "While only two of the castings l are shown, a greater number will undoubtedly be found to be ji desirable, as shown in the said patent. Each of the castings contains two cavities 15, and the cover casting, together with each of the other castings, provides projections 16 adapted to register with the cavities 15. A refrigerated liquid is adapted to be circulated through the hollow portions of the castings in order to facilitate heat transfer. By the use of suitable pres¬ sure means, the load of fish pieces is firmly compacted into a solid body, substantially all of the air voids being eliminated. In this manner the product is quickly frozen and the resultant block, as shown in Fig. 3, is regular in shape, dense and solidly frozen. In this condition each block is separated, along the dotted lines shown in fig. 3 by the use of any suitable means, such as a band saw, not shown, with the result that the block is divided into a large number of small elongated sections or fingers 17, as shown in Fig. 4 of a size suitable for serving. Each of these small sections is composed of parts of many uneven pieces that compose the original block. The portions 17 are then placed in the basket 10 and again immersed in the tank 11 containing egg white or similar naterial and immediately upon removal are rolled in or dusted with a granulated edible vegetable product such as potato meal, corn meal, cracker crumbs or flour, with the resulting product 18, such as shorn in Fig. 5. The finished product is then packed in ; a carton 19, such as shown in Fig. 6, a small consumer's carton "being shown. However, for institutions such as hotels, restaurant retail stores, etc., the pieces will be packed in large containers adapted to receive five, ten or more pounds, which package may be retained in an ordinary ice box for relatively long periods of time without deterioration or development of fish odor. In use the housewife or chef merely removes the number of required pieces for immediate service, drops them into hot fat without defrosting, and cooks them in the usual manner. The heat of cooking serves to immediately set the albumen in the coating material and as the heat penetrates the body of material the coating for the individual pieces will likewise be set, thus holding the pieces firmly together. The cooked product will be found to be comparable in ail respects to freshly caught fish and all of the loss, delay and bother of handling and storing that lias heretofore been experienced is eliminated. The coating material for the severed portions may be any suitable edible substance that has the capacity to seal the product against the loss of internal moisture; that will act as an adhesive support for the granular coating; or if a coating OO is not to be applied that will prevent the portions from adhering when they are closely packed for shipment. While the foregoing description has been directed to the preparation of fish for merchandizing, it is obvious that many, if not all of the advantages set forth would result from a similar treatment of meat, poultry, etc., and this should be understood in connection with the description and in the claims. It should be understood also that in referring to fish, I intend to include seafoods, such as shrimps, oysters, clams, scallops, lobsters, etc. ,• 1H011 1.
