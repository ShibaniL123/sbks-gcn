Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of cefadroxil of the formula (I). More, particularly, the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of cefadroxil having water content in the range of 4-5 %. Ho.. o (i) NH 20--" "- N - C H 3 COOH Background of the Invention Cefadroxil is chemically known as 7- [D-ct..amino-cx-(phydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-3-methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid. It is a wellknown antibiotic substance having antibacterial activity and is disclosed in US Patent No. 3,489,752. US patent No. 3,985,741 discloses preparation of cefadroxil by acylation of 7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA) with the mixed anhydride of -(-)<z-(p-hydroxyphenyl)glycine. US patent No. 4,504,657 claims a different form of cefadroxil that is the crystalline form of cefadroxi], known as cefadroxil monohydrate having a welldefined X-ray diffraction pattern. This crystalline cefadroxil monohydrate is obtained by acylation of silylated 7-ADCA acid with D(-)cz-amino<x-(phydroxyphenyl)acetyl chloride hydrochloride. US patent No. 4,962,195 discloses yet another novel crystalline cefadroxil having water content of about 3% and characterized by distinct X-ray diffraction properties. This novel cefadroxil is called "cefadroxil hemihydrate" and is shown to be more stable than crystalline cefadroxil monohydrate. US patent Nos. 4,962,195 and 5,023,331 discloses a method of producing eefadroxil hemihydrate by adding to an aqueous solution containing cefadroxil prepared from 7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid, a solvent selected om the group consisting of dimethylacetamide, monomethylformamide or N-methyl2-pyrrolidone at a controlled pH (5.5 to 6.0) to give the corresponding cefadroxil solvate which precipitates and is filtered off. After the cefadroxil solwtte is dried, it is slurred with a mixture of methanol-isopropyl alcohol 30:70 to 50:50 by volume at a temperature in the range of 45°C to 55 °C, to give crystalline cefadroxil hemihydrate which is isolated by filtration. Both these patents report that the use of the cefadroxil solvates of dimethylacetamide, of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and of monomethylformamide is critical for the preparation of crystalline cefadroxil hemihydrate and that it was impossible to obtain the desired crystalline cefadroxil hemihydrate from the known cefadroxil dimethyl formamide solvate (U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,985,741, 4,504,657 and U.S. Pat. No. RE 31,730). It always resulted in the isolation of the known crystalline cefadroxil monohydrate due to the fact that the cefadroxil dimethyl formamide solvate has a K.F. value of 1.8% or more. US patent No. 4,358,588 discloses a process for the preparation of cefadroxil comprising silylating 7-ADCA with silylating agent selected from trimethylchlorosilane and treating the resulting silylated ADCA with an equimolar amount of mixed anhydride in the presence of inert anhydrous, organic solvent. US patent No. 5,998,610 discloses a process for the silylation of 7-aminodesacetoxy-cephalosporanic acid by silylation in certain carboxylic acid esters and its use in the production of 6-alpha-aminoacyl-penicillins and 7-alphaaminoacyl-desacetoxy-cephalosporins. US patent No. 6,337,396 discloses a method of producing crystalline cefadroxil hemihydrate, from cefadroxil dimethyl formamide solvate which comprises slurrying cefadroxil dimethyl formamide solvate with a mixture of a lower alkanol and water, at a temperature in the range of about 40 °C to 50 °C and isolating the crystalline cefadroxil hemihydrate from the reaction mixture. US patent No. 5,329,001 disclose a method of producing crystalline cefadroxil having a water content from about 0.8 % to about 3.9 %.
