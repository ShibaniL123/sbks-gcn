Automatic Transfer Switch Maintenance Bypass Cabinet RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/946,219 filed February 28, 2014, entitled "Automatic Transfer Switch Maintenance Bypass Cabinet", the contents of the identified application are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety. FIELD OF INVENTION Embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to transfer switches for use with electrical distribution systems and more particularly to a bypass breaker that provides automatic transfer switch transitions. BACKGROUND An automatic transfer switch is a switch that can transfer a power source from a first source to a second source when a disturbance is sensed in a power transmission. A conventional automatic transfer switch includes coupling the primary power source and a backup power source to the transfer switch to provide temporary power to the load if the primary source fails. A conventional automatic transfer switch can include a bypass isolation open or closed transition system that switches between a load and two sources of power. In conventional approaches, some facilities may have power systems structured to provide an uninterruptable power supply. The primary source may be the power utility and the backup source may be a backup power source. Power can be supplied over a period of time from both sources. During maintenance of a conventional automatic transfer switch the entire facility must be taken off line or the facility may have power supplied from one source but removing the backup capabilities of the system. SUMMARY Taught herein are apparatus and methods that utilize an automatic transfer switch bypass breaker to electrically isolate an automatic transfer switch from a power source and a load. Isolation of the automatic transfer switch can allow for maintenance operations to be performed on the automatic transfer switch without disrupting the power supply to the facility, or reducing the redundancy of the system by removing a second source of power. For example, exemplary embodiments can be directed to decoupling a plurality of power sources and a load from the automatic transfer switch and configuring a bypass breaker to provide power directly to the load. Embodiments taught herein are directed to an automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system for isolating the automatic transfer switch from the first power source, the second power source, and the load receiving power from one of the power sources. The automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system includes a switch gear configured with an automatic transfer switch electrically couplable to a first power source and a common load bus. The automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system includes an automatic transfer switch bypass breaker electrically couplable to the first power source and to the common load bus and a utility bypass breaker electrically couplable to the first power source and the common load bus. The first power source can be a utility power source or a generator power source. In some embodiments, the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker may include a bypass switch for supplying power from the first power source directly to the common load bus. In some embodiments, an emergency bypass breaker can supply power directly from an emergency or backup power source directly to the load. For example, the first power source can be decoupled when the emergency or backup power source is engaged. In some embodiments, the utility bypass breaker can be external to the switch gear configured with the automatic transfer switch. In some embodiments, a mechanical key system can be used to engage the first power source to supply power directly to the load and to electrically isolate the switch gear configured with the automatic transfer switch and the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker from the common load bus. In some embodiments, a mechanical key system can be used to engage the emergency bypass breaker for supplying power from the emergency power supply to the load and electrically isolating the switch gear configured with the automatic transfer switch, the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker and the first power source. In another aspect, embodiments taught herein are directed to a method of operating the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system for isolating the automatic transfer switch from a power source while the system continues to provide power to a load. The method includes physically decoupling and electrically isolating the automatic transfer switch from a first power source, a second power source and a common load bus. The first power source can be physically and electrically coupled to an automatic transfer switch bypass breaker and supply power to the common load bus. Electrical and physical isolation of the first power source, the second power source and the common load bus can be maintained from the automatic transfer switch while the first power source provides power to the common load bus. In some embodiments, a normal bypass operation of the first power source can be disrupted. In some embodiments, an emergency bypass operation can be initiated. In some embodiments, the emergency bypass operation can be disrupted. In some embodiments, a kirk key system can physically and electrically isolate a component of an automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system. A kirk key system can include any mechanical or electro-mechanical interlocks, solenoid key releases, time delay releases or transfer panels or the like. In some embodiments, a bypass breaker control system can terminate a bypass operation. The first power source and the second power source can be physically and electrically coupled to the automatic transfer switch to supply power through the automatic transfer switch to the common load bus. Any combination or permutation of embodiments is envisioned.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Embodiments taught herein, include or use a utility bypass breaker for transferring power between a plurality of power sources, a common load bus and an automatic transfer switch configured to isolate the automatic transfer switch and the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker from the power sources and the common load bus. Embodiments taught herein relate to systems and methods for transferring power between multiple power sources, the common load bus, the automatic transfer switch, the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker and a utility bypass breaker. Some embodiments taught herein may use power supplied from a power utility, power supplied from a cogeneration facility or power supplied from an onsite generation device. An onsite generation device may include power generation through alternative energy technologies such as photovoltaic solar converters, wind generation or hydroelectric generation devices. Some embodiments taught herein may include power supplied from an auxiliary or back up power supply. An auxiliary or backup power supply may include an emergency generator, a power distribution unit, or an uninterruptable power supply. In some embodiments the auxiliary power supply may include power supplied from a power utility, power supplied from a cogeneration facility or power supplied from an onsite generation device. Some embodiments can include a single common load bus or a plurality of loads. Some embodiments taught herein can include a bypass breaker with simultaneous switching capabilities. Simultaneous switching can include transferring power from a first source to a second source without disrupting power to the load. The bypass breaker may be configured for automatic switching or may be configured for manual switching. An automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system in accordance with embodiments taught herein can include a switch gear configured with an automatic transfer switch electrically couplable to a first power source and a common load bus. The automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system can also include an automatic transfer switch bypass breaker and a utility bypass breaker both electrically couplable to the first power source and to the common load bus. For example, enablement of a method of operating an automatic transfer switch bypass breaker for isolating the automatic transfer switch from the power source and the load allows scheduled maintenance and servicing of the automatic transfer switch and the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker. Scheduled maintenance and service of the components of a commercial, residential, industrial or institutional facility power system improves operational capabilities and prevents power disruptions due to component failures and system downtime. The embodiments taught herein allow scheduled maintenance to occur on automatic transfer switch of an electrical switch gear without electrical system downtime, which, in turn allows business operations to continue while the maintenance or repair is performed. Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system 200 suitable for implementation of the exemplary embodiments. As shown in Figure 1, the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system 200, includes four operational states. The automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system includes a normal operation state, an emergency bypass operation state, a normal bypass operation state, and an emergency operation state. The automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system can include a switch gear having a switching function transferring power directly from a first power source or an auxiliary power source to a load bypassing an automatic transfer switch. The automatic transfer switch bypass breaker can include a first power source 202, a breaker 204, a normal switch 206, an automatic transfer switch 210, an internal switch wiper 226, an emergency breaker 214, an emergency bypass breaker 216, a secondary power source 218 for example a generator, a load breaker 222 and a common load bus connection 224. The automatic transfer switch can be configured with a first input contact 208, a second input contact 212, an internal switch wiper 226 and an output contact 220. The switches discussed herein may comprise mechanical switches, such as a breaker, electronics switches such as a silicon controlled rectifier or any number of other devices that can be adapted to transfer power. System 200 may be implemented, for example, in a commercial, industrial, residential or institutional facility and access multiple power sources or load configurations. As shown in Figure 1, the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system 200, can be configured for a normal operation state. The normal operation state includes power conditions and system power requirements. In the present embodiment, the system 200, can be configured to receive power from the first power source 202 and transfer the power to the breaker 206, which is configured in a closed position and is electrically coupled to the first input contact 208 of the automatic transfer switch 210. During normal operation, power can be received at the first input contact 208. The internal switch wiper 226 can be configured to provide a connection between the first input contact 208 and the output contact 220. Power can be transferred from the output contact 220 of the automatic transfer switch 210 to the load breaker 222 that can be coupled to the load 224. During normal operation, the load breaker 222 remains in a closed position to allow power transmission from the automatic transfer switch 210 to the load 224. To provide backup generation power, the emergency breaker 214 can be coupled to the secondary power source 218 and the second input contact 212 of the automatic transfer switch 210 and remains in a closed position. When the system 200 functions in normal operation mode, the breaker 204 is coupled to the first power source 202 and the load 224 remains open. During normal operation, the emergency bypass breaker 216 is coupled to the secondary power source 218 and the load 224 remains open. As further shown in Figure 1, the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system 200 can be configured for an emergency bypass operation state. A disruption to the baseline power conditions or system components can cause the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system 200 to operate in the emergency bypass operation state. A disruption to the power supply 202, or the failure of the automatic transfer switch 210 can necessitate transferring power directly from the secondary power source 218 through the closed emergency bypass breaker 216 to the load 224. The power disruption may include preventative maintenance on a system component, a component failure or a disruption to the first power source 202. In the emergency bypass operation state, power can be supplied from a second power source 218. The second power source 218 can include an alternate utility power, an auxiliary power system, renewable power, a generator, a battery system, or an uninterruptible power supply. In some embodiments, in an emergency bypass operation state, the breaker 206 can be open, isolating power from the first input contact 208 of the automatic transfer switch 210. The normal bypass breaker 204 can be open, electrically isolating the first power source 202 from the load 224. In an emergency bypass operation state, the emergency switch 214 can be open, electrically isolating the second input contact 212 of the automatic transfer switch 210. In an exemplary embodiment, the load switch 222 can be open, electrically isolating the load 224 from the automatic transfer switch 210. Still referring to Figure 1, automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system can be configured for a normal bypass operation. A disruption to the baseline power conditions or system components can cause the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system 200 to operate in a normal bypass operation state. The power disruption may be attributed to preventative maintenance on a system component, such as the automatic transfer switch 210 or a component failure of the automatic transfer switch 210. During the normal bypass operation, power can be transferred from the first power source 202 through closed breaker 204 to the load 224. For example, during a normal bypass operation state the breaker 206 can be open, electrically isolating power from the first input contact 208 of the automatic transfer switch 210. In a normal bypass operation state, the emergency breaker 214 can be open to electrically isolate the second input contact 212 of the automatic transfer switch 210. The emergency bypass breaker 216 can be open, electrically isolating the secondary power source 218 from the load. In an exemplary embodiment, the load breaker 222 can be open, electrically isolating the load 224 from the automatic transfer switch 210. To provide continuous power to the load 224, the breaker 204 can be can be in a closed position, thereby allowing power transmission from the first power source 202, through the breaker 204 to the load 224. As further shown in Figure 1, the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker can be configured for an emergency operation state. A disruption to the power supply 202 can necessitate transferring power directly from the secondary power source 218 through second contact 212 to the automatic transfer switch 210 to the breaker 222 to the load 224. During the emergency bypass operation, power can be supplied from a second power source which can include an alternate utility power, an auxiliary power system, renewable power, a generator, a battery system, or an uninterruptible power supply. For example, during normal operation, the emergency breaker 214 can be coupled to the second input contact 212 while an emergency bypass breaker 216 remains open. The emergency breaker 214 can provide continuous power to the load if a disruption occurs to the first power source 202 or electrical isolation of the first power source 202 is required. If disruption occurs to the first power source 202, transition from the normal operation state to the emergency bypass operation state can electrically couple the second input contact 212 to the output contact 220 by internal switch wiper 226 of the automatic transfer switch 210. When the system 200 is in an emergency backup operation state, the automatic transfer switch 210 can transmit power through the output contact 220 through the breaker 222 electrically coupled to the load circuitry 224. During the emergency operation, the breaker 222 electrically coupled to the load circuitry can remain closed allowing power transmission to the load 224. In some embodiments, in an emergency operation state, the breaker 206 can be open, isolating power from the first input contact 208 of the automatic transfer switch 210. The normal bypass breaker 204 can be open, electrically isolating the first power source 202 from the load 224. In the emergency operation state, the emergency bypass breaker 216 remains open, thereby electrically isolating the second power source from supplying power directly to the load 224. In some embodiments, the automatic transfer switch 210 can be electrically isolated from the power source 202 or the load 222 by physically locking the bypass breaker 216 or decoupling the breaker 214 from the system 200. In some embodiments, a key interlock member or the like can be used to isolate the automatic transfer switch 210 from the system 200. For example, a key interlock member may be a kirk key system. The bypass breaker 216 can include a plurality of sensors disposed throughout the system to sense when the automatic transfer switch is electrically isolated. Additional isolating switches may be disposed throughout the system for further back up isolation protection. Mechanical key locking systems can be disposed through the system to physically and electrically isolate portions of the system. A control system including multiple sensors may be disposed throughout the system to monitor the physical and electrical isolation of portions of the system. Figure 2 is a block diagram of an exemplary arrangement of an automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system in a facility power control system in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure.

Figure 3 is a flow diagram of an exemplary process for operating an automatic transfer switch bypass breaker in an environment supplying power to a facility as taught herein. The exemplary process isolates the automatic transfer switch and the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker while maintaining power to the electrical loads in the facility. The automatic transfer switch bypass breaker environment can receive power from a first power source and a second power source, and can include an automatic transfer switch, an automatic transfer switch bypass breaker external to the automatic transfer switch, a utility bypass breaker and a load. The process may be implemented, for example, for a single automatic transfer switch or across a plurality of automatic transfer switches. The process may be implemented across a single primary power source or across a plurality of primary power sources. The process may include a single secondary power source or a plurality of secondary power source sources. The process may include a single load configuration or a plurality of load configurations. The exemplary process is described in conjunction with the exemplary schematics of Figures 1 and 2. At step 602, the process may begin. At step 604, the automatic transfer switch 210, the first power source 202 and the load 224 are identified. For example, the first power source 202 may include a single source such as power generated within the facility, utility power or renewable power sources or may include a combination of different power generation sources. At step 606, the automatic transfer switch 210 is decoupled from the first power source 202 and the second power source 218. For example, decoupling the first and the second power source 202, 218 can be accomplished by using a mechanical or electrical switch to isolate the automatic transfer switch 210. A key interlock member may be employed to physically isolate and decouple the power from the automatic transfer switch. At step 608, the load 224 can be decoupled from the automatic transfer switch 210. At step 610, the first power source 202 can bypass the automatic transfer switch and provide power directly to the load 224. For example, steps 606, 608 and 610 can be performed simultaneously or nearly simultaneously with switching algorithms to prevent disruption in the power supplied to the load 224. At step 612, the electrical isolation of the first and the second power source 202, 218 and the load is maintained from the automatic transfer switch while the first power source 202 provides power directly to the load 224. At step 614, the electrical isolation from the first power source 202, the second power source 218 and the load 224 to the automatic transfer switch is terminated. The first power source 202 and the second power source 218 are electrically coupled to the automatic transfer switch 210 and the load 224 may draw power through the automatic transfer switch 210. The process ends at step 616. Figure 4 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary power system 700 with a mechanical lockout system suitable for implementation of the exemplary embodiments. In some embodiments, as shown in Figure 4, the exemplary power system 700 can include a power feed from a first power source 702, a power feed from a second power source 704, a power feed to an automatic transfer switch 708, a power feed from an automatic transfer switch 714, and a power feed to an emergency breaker 720.

The load breaker 712 can be electrically coupled to the load side of the automatic transfer switch 714. The output of the second breaker 710 and the load breaker 712 can be electrically coupled to the load 740. Still referring to Figure 4, the second power source 704 can transmit power to the emergency breaker 718 that can be mechanically coupled to the first key interlock member 722 and a sixth key interlock member 730, and the output can be electrically coupled to the emergency breaker 720. The second power source 704 can transmit power to the emergency bypass breaker 716 that can be mechanically coupled to the first key interlock member 722 having an output electrically coupled to the bypass panel 740. As shown in Figure 4, the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system 700 can be configured to transition from a normal automatic transfer switch state to a normal bypass state. The automatic transfer switch may require electrical isolation to periodically conduct repairs or preventative maintenance operations. In the normal bypass state the second power source 704 can be electrically isolated from the power transmission by electrically decoupling the emergency breaker 718 into an open position by disengaging the first key interlock member 722 and the sixth key interlock member 730. The sixth key interlock member 730 can be stored in the transition block 750 that is a hold over area for disengaged locking elements. The second breaker 710 can be placed in the closed position by inserting the first key interlock member 722.

The normal breaker 706 can be placed in an open position by disengaging the fourth key interlock member 728 and engaging the third key interlock member 726. The fourth key interlock member 728 can be stored in the transition block 750. Upon completion of the transition sequence the automatic transfer switch can be electrically isolated from the power transmission. Referring to Figure 4, the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system 700 can be configured to transition from a normal bypass state to a normal automatic transfer switch state. In the normal bypass state, the second power source 704 can be closed to electrically couple the second power source 704 to the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system. During the transition to the normal bypass state, the second breaker 710 can be closed, thereby electrically coupling the first power source 702 to the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system. The transition can include mechanically engaging and disengaging the second key interlock member 724, with the transition block 750 to disengage the fourth key interlock member 728 from the transition block 750. The first breaker 706 can be placed in a closed position by engaging the fourth key interlock member 728 and disengaging the third key interlock member 726. The load breaker 712 can be placed in a closed position by engaging the third key interlock member 726 and disengaging the second key interlock member 724. The second breaker 710 can be placed in an open position by engaging the second key interlock member 724 and disengaging the first key interlock member 722. The emergency breaker 718 can be placed in an open position by engaging the first key interlock member 722 and disengaging the sixth key interlock member 730. The sixth key interlock member 730 can be placed in the transition block 750 and the system can resume normal automatic transfer switch operation. As depicted in Figure 4, the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system 700 can be configured to transition from a normal bypass state to an emergency bypass state. In the emergency bypass state, the second power source 704 can transmit power to the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system 700. The transition can include mechanically engaging the fourth key interlock member 728 and the sixth key interlock member 730 in the transition block 750 and mechanically disengaging the second key interlock member 724. The second breaker 710 can be placed in an open position by engaging the second key interlock member 724 and disengaging the first key interlock member 722. The emergency bypass breaker 716 can be placed in a closed position by engaging the first key interlock member 722 and the second power source 704 can supply power to the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system 700. As depicted in Figure 4, the automatic transfer switch bypass breaker system 700 can be configured to transition from an emergency bypass state to a normal bypass state. Utility power can be restored to an emergency bypass state by placing the emergency bypass breaker 716 in an open position and disengaging the first key interlock member 722. The second breaker 710 can be placed in a closed position by engaging the first key interlock member 722 and disengaging the second key interlock member 724.
