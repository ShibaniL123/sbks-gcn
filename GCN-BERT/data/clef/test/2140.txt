Step 8. Preparation of 3-(1-Aminoethyl)-8-chloro-2-phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one
8-Chloro-3-(1-(hydroxyimino)ethyl)-2-phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one (3.1g, 0.01mol) and 50ml of acetic acid were added to a 100ml three-necked flask and stirred to be dissolved. Activated zinc powder (3.3g, 0.05ml) and 10ml of methanol were then added; temperature was raised to 45Â°C and mixture was stirred for 5h. TLC tracking was performed until the completion of the reaction. The reaction was stopped and suction filtration was performed. The filter cake was washed with a large amount of ethyl acetate; solvent was removed under reduced pressure; and 50ml water and 100ml ethyl acetate were added to the residue. Organic layer was removed and the pH of aqueous layer was adjusted to 12 with 5M sodium hydroxide. A large amount of light yellow solid was precipitated and subjected to suction filtration and water washing. The filter cake was dried to give 1.7g of a light yellow solid with a yield of 58.1 %.
