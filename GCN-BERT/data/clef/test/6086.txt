...... / ,' I F i « c This invention relates to novel steroids and particularly to 14c-hydroxy-progestérorí and derivatives thereof° The compounds of the present invention are compounds having the following structural formulae: i,] :)i vi I .'1 :i 'i i t I I -i ï i H3 C=0 t CH3 I C=0 I i ' 6H 0 R wherein R is a hydroxy group, keto Õroul (=0), or an 6 acyloxy group having the formula - - - R', wherein 7 R' îs a hydrocarbon group and preferably having less 8 than nine carbon atoms. These compounds have cortisone9 like activity and therefore can be compounded and used lO in a manner similar to cortisone° ll In accordance with the invention, progesterone is 12 subjected to a fermentation process by means of an 13 oxygenating strain of Curvularia lunata (NRRL-2474) to 14 produce 4-pregnene-llç,14c-diol-3,20-dione and 4-pregnene7a»14a-diol-3,20-dioneo The 7-acyloxy derivatives of 16 4-pregnene-Va,14a-diol-3,20-dione are prepared by re17 acting with an acylating agent. The 7-hydroxy compound 18 can be reacted with an oxidizing agent to produce the 19 corresponding 7-keto compound. i i The fermentation of progesterone to produce the 14ahydroxyprogester m is conveniently carried out by sub= 3 Jesting progesterone to the action of an oxygenating 4 enzyme produced by growing an oxygenating strain of Curvularia lunata (NRRL-2474) o This is accomplished by 6 growing the microorganism under aerobic conditions in a 7 suitable nutrient medium in intimate contact with the 8 progesterone; the culturing growth of the microorganism 9 being continued until the oxygenation has occurred. I0 The progesterone can be added to the nutrient medium Il as a suspension in a suitable solvent such as water, as 12 a solution in a solvent such as acetone, propylene glycol, 13 dîmethylformamide or dimethylacetamide, or in a finely 14 divided form such as a solid micronized powder..In general, it is desirable that the progesterone be 16 present in very finely divided form in order to permit IV maximum contact with the oxygenating culture medium and 18 insure completion of the reaction. AI1 of the progesterone 19 can be added at one time or the addition can be continuous or intermittent over a period of time. 21 The process can be effected in both stationary and 22 submerged culture of Curvularia lunata (NRRL-2474) under 23 aerobic conditions, although for practical purposes it 24 is most conveniently carried out by growing the microorganism under submerged conditions in a suitable aqueous 26 fermentation medium containing the progesterone. The 27 amount of the progesterone which can be conveñient y - 4 - 401 7 ?rc Il "" 12 : .17 i 19 oxygenated, will depend in part upon the particular medium employed. Aqueous nutrient mediums suitable for the growing of oxygenatîng strains of the microorganisms must contain sources of assimilable carbon and nitrogen as well as minor amounts of inorganic salts. Any of the usual æurces of assimilable carbon such as dextrose, cerelose, glucose, inverted molasses and the llke employed in fermentation mediums can be used in carrying out the process of our invention. Similarly, complex sources of nitrogen usually employed in commercial fermentation process such as lactalbumin digest ("Edamlne") and corn steep liquor, or inorganic sources of nitrogen such as dibasic ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, and the llke, are satisfactory for use in the fermentation mediums. Minor amounts of other substances such as nicotlnamlde or inorganic salts, such as suitable soluble salts of magnesium, zinc, potassium, sodium, phosphorous, and iron are usually available in complex sources of carbon and nitrogen or may be conveniently added to the fermentation medium in minor amounts to promote maximum growth of the oxygenating microorganism. The addition of minor amounts of antifoaming agents, although not essential, is desirable with some fermentation mediums. It has been found that the addition to certain fermentation mediums of a substituted oxazoline which is a nonvolatile, amineJ i type, cationic surface active agent available under the 2 trade name Alkaterge C is particularly effective in re3 duc ng the amount of foam, although other antifoam agents 4 known to be useful for this purpose can also be used. When the oxygenation is complete, the oxygenated 6 progesterone can be recovered from the fermentation broth 7 by extraction with a suitable water immiscible organic 8 solvent for the oxygenated steroids. Suitable solvents 9 for this purpose that might be mentioned are chloroform, lO methylene chloride, 2-methyl-5-ethyl pyridine, organic 'll acid esters, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones and amides, 12 and the like. The solvent solution containing the de13 sired oxygenated steroid can then be evaporated to 14 yield the desired products which can be further purified, 18 separated by fractional crystallization or other pro16 cedures conventional in the art. 1V The corresponding 7-acyloxy derivatives of the 18 4-pregnene-7a,14a-diol-3,20-dione are prepared by re19 acting with a suitable acylating agent such as a carboxyllc acid halide, ester, ketone or anhydride in a 21 suitable solvent medium. This acylation can be achieved 22 in organic bases such as pyridine and alkyl derivatives 23 thereof, tertiary bases such as dialkyl anilines, 24 quinolines and trialkyl amines. It is preferred to use the appropriate carboxylîc acid anhydride in 26 pyridine° The esterification of the 7-hydroxy group 27 is conveniently accomplished by effecting the reaction v <i .i "i i ,»3 )840 i0 il at ordinary temperatures in from about one-half to three hours. After the reaction is complete, the desired ester is readily recovered by diluting the reaction mixture with water and filtering the product which separates. Representative 7-acyloxy derivatives of 4-pre nene-7a,14a-diol3,20-dione which can thus be prepared are those derivatives from carboxylic acid containing less than nine carbon atoms which are saturated or unsaturated aliphatic, or carbocyclic, cyeloaliphat!c, aryl, alkaryl, mono, di or polycarboxylic acids, such as formyloxy, acetoxy, propionyloxy, butyryloxy, valeryloxy, hexanoyloxy, heptanoyloxy, octanoyloxy, benzoxy, phenylacetoxy, toluoyloxy, cyc!opentylformyloxy, -cyelopentyl propionoxy, acryly!oxy, cyclohexanoyloxy, and those formed with masonic, malelc, succinic, glutaric, adip!c acids and the like. The 4-pregnene-Ta,14a-d!ol-3,20-dione is converted to 4-pregnene-14a-ol-3,7,20-trlone by treating with an oxidizing agent. Any of the conventional oxidizing agents can be used. Typical examples of suitable oxidizing agents are aluminum tertiary butoxide in the .... presence of a lower ketone/such as acetone, dichromate such as sodium dichromate in acetic acid, and hexa23 valent chromium, such as chromic acid or chromyl chloride, 24pyridine chromate, permanganates, the peroxides such as benzo-peracid, phthalic mono-peracid or hydrogen per26 oxide, advantageously in the presence of osmium tetroxide. 27 The oxidation is most conveniently carried out at room • i i Z:j i i:il H i ,/" 9 Il temoerature (20-30°C.) and at which temperature it requires from one to twelve hours for completion. The product can be recovered by conventional procedures such as extracting with a solvent such as ethyl acetate and removing the solvent to crystallize the product. The 4-pregnene-Va,14a-diol-õ,20-dione can be dehydrated to form the corresponding 4,6-çregnadiene and 4,6,8(14)-pregnatriene compounds by reacting with a dehydrating agent. Suitable dehydrating agents are concentrated organic or inorganic acids or their anhydrides, for example fatty acids, hydrohalic acids, and phosphorous pentoxide, or inorganic salts, for example zinc chloride or potassium bisulfate, and also catalytically active agents, such as iodine in the presence or absence of diluents. The employment of lower organic fatty acids, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and so on, is particularly advantageous. The dehydration can be carried out in the presence of a solvent such as lower alcohols or ketones as for example methanol, ethanol, propanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and the like. The reaction is preferably carried out at the reflux temperature of the mixture but higher and lower temperatures can be used. The reaction usually reqúires from one-half to four hours. The product can be recovered by conventional procedures such as extracting with an organic solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon and evaporating to dryness.
