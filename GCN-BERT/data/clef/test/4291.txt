Dated this 15th day of January, 2014 Name : jy NagorT Badri Prakash To, The Controller of Patents The Patent Office, Intellectual Property Office Building, Plot No. 32, Sector 14, Dwarka, New Delhi-110075 2014 017 Herbal Formulation for Wound Healing Field of Invention This invention relates to herbal formulation for wound healing. More particularly the invention relates to semisolid formulation comprising extract of Cynodon dactylon for the treatments of cuts and wounds. Background of the Invention According to the wound healing society, wounds are physical injuries that result in an opening or break of the skin that causes disturbance in the normal skin anatomy and function. They result in the loss of continuity of epithelium with or without the loss of underlying connective tissue. Wounds are a major cause of physical disabilities. Wounds represent a significant burden on the patients and health care professionals worldwide. They not only affect physical and mental health of millions of patients but also impose significant cost on them. Current estimates indicate that worldwide nearly 6 million people suffer from chronic wounds. Formulations available in the market for the treatment of wounds are generally semisolid in nature like creams, gels and ointments. Their common property is the ability to cling to the surface of application for reasonable duration before they are being washed or worn off. Cynodon dactylon is a perennial grass of Poaceae family. It is also known as Durva grass, Bermuda grass, Bahama grass or Doob. It has a variety of medicinal properties. Researchers have demonstrated antiarrhythmic, antidiabetic, antidiarrheal, antioxidant, antiulcer, cardioprotective, CNS depressant, hepatoprotective and immunomodulatory activities of C. dactylon. C. dactylon is traditionally used as a remedy for a variety of disorders such as diarrhea, hemorrhoids, leucoderma, hemorrhage, hypertension, hysteria, snakebite, sores, stones, urogenital disorders, warts, wounds and eye disorders. Paste and juice of C. dactylon is traditionally used for healing of minor cuts and wounds. Extract of C. dactylon alone and in combination with other plant extracts has shown wound healing activity in the test animals. However, in the market no wound healing formulation of this plant is yet available. Herbal formulations present a healthier, safer and economic alternative to the formulations containing synthetic ingredients. Administration of plant extracts in the form of a ORlCs JL ' pharmaceutical formulation is always preferred over using the extracts as such. Looking at the potential of C. dactylon in wound healing, there exists a need of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising C. dactylon extract that can be used by the patients suffering from cuts and wounds. Object of the invention It is the main object of the invention to provide a wound healing formulation comprising C. dactylon extract. It is another object of the present invention to provide a wound healing formulation that is ecofriendly. It is another object of the invention to provide a wound healing formulation that is free from any paraffin ingredient. It is another object of the invention to provide a wound healing formulation that is devoid of any ingredient harmful to the skin. It is a further object of the invention to provide a wound healing formulation that is non-irritating to skin. Another object of the invention is to provide a wound healing formulation that is effective, easy to use and stable. Summary of the invention The present invention provides a novel wound healing formulation. In one embodiment of the invention the wound healing formulation is formulated as a water removable (O/W) ointment of C. dactylon extract. The ointment comprises a natural polymer, beeswax, lanolin, arachis oil, anise oil, vitamin E oil, glycerin and purified water in amounts of up to 18% of a natural polymer, up to 8% of beeswax, up to 8% of lanolin, up to 10% of arachis oil, up to 5% of anise oil, up to 5% of vitamin E oil, up to 14% of glycerin and up to 40% of purified water, wherein the said constituents are expressed in terms of weight percent.

In another embodiment of the invention, beeswax is used as the stiffening agent, anhydrous lanolin (wool fat) is used as the base to produce O/W emulsion, arachis oil is used as an emollient, anise oil is used as preservative, vitamin E oil is used as the antioxidant and glycerin is used as the humectant and lubricant in the formulation. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of a wound healing formulation of C. dactylon extract comprising up to 18% of a natural polymer, up to 8% of beeswax, up to 8% of lanolin, up to 10% of arachis oil, up to 5% of anise oil, up to 5% of vitamin E oil, up to 14% of glycerin and up to 40% of purified water, wherein the said constituents are expressed in terms of weight percent, said process comprising forming an oily phase by melting beeswax on a water bath and mixing anhydrous lanolin, arachis oil, anise oil and vitamin E oil in it, preparing an aqueous phase by mixing together glycerin, purified water and the natural polymer, incorporating C. dactylon extract in the aqueous phase, introducing the oily phase into the aqueous phase with constant stirring and allowing the mixture to cool at room temperature. Detailed description of the present invention The present invention relates to a wound healing formulation comprising C. dactylon extract. In a preferred embodiment according to the present invention the wound healing formulation is formulated as a water removable (O/W) ointment. The ointment of the preferred embodiment comprises C. dactylon extract and at least one natural polymer. The natural polymer used may be acacia gum, guar gum, tragacanth, pectin and the like. In addition, other ingredients used include beeswax, lanolin, arachis oil, anise oil, vitamin E oil and glycerin. The composition of the formulation is new, safe, eco-friendly and does not produce any harmful effect on the body. All components in the formulation are from natural sources and are very safe and eco-friendly. Natural polymers like acacia gum, guar gum, tragacanth and pectin are used as the emulsifying agents in the formulation. Acacia is the dried, gummy exudation from the stem and branches of Acacia nilotica (Linn.) Del. subsp. indica (Benth.) Brenan (syn. A. arabica Willd. var. indica Benth.) (Fam. Leguminosae), or other species of Acacia. It is almost entirely soluble in twice its weight of water yielding a very viscous, slightly acidic solution. Acacia gum is practically insoluble in ethanol (95%) and in ether. Guar gum is a gum ORIGINAL Q ^ obtained from the ground endosperms of the seeds of Cyamopsis tetragonolobus (Linn.) Taub or other species of Cyamopsis (Fam. Leguminosae). It consists mainly of a high molecular weight hydrocolloidal polysaccharide, composed of galactan and mannan units combined through glycosidic linkages. When it is stirred with 50 parts of water, a thick jelly is formed which, with further addition of 150 parts of water, yields a thick transparent suspension; practically insoluble in ethanol (95%). Tragacanth is the air-hardened gummy exudate, flowing naturally or obtained by incision from the trunk and branches of Astragalus gummifer Labill. and certain other species of Astragalus. On the addition of about 10 times its weight of water, it forms a mucilaginous gel. Pectin is a purified carbohydrate product obtained from the dilute acid extract of the inner portion of the rind of citrus fruits or from apple pomace. It consists chiefly of partially methoxylated polygalacturonic acids. It is soluble in water forming a viscous, opalescent, colloidal solution which flows readily; practically insoluble in ethanol (95%) and in other organic solvents. Beeswax is used as the stiffening agent, anhydrous lanolin (wool fat) is used as the base to produce O/W emulsion, arachis oil is used as an emollient, anise oil is used as preservative, vitamin E oil is used as the antioxidant and glycerin is used as the humectant and lubricant in the formulation. Powdered whole plant of C. dactylon was extracted using hydroalcoholic solvent system. Beeswax was heated and melted to about 65 °C on a water bath. Anhydrous lanolin, arachis oil, anise oil and vitamin E oil were mixed to it and the mixture was melted to obtain the oily phase. To prepare the aqueous phase, glycerin and purified water were mixed together and heated to about 65 °C on a water bath. Then required amount of the natural polymer (acacia gum/ guar gum/ tragacanth/ pectin) was slowly added to it with constant stirring. C. dactylon extract was then mixed thoroughly in this aqueous phase. The oily phase was introduced in the aqueous phase with gentle and continuous stirring until a uniform mass of ointment was obtained. It was allowed to cool with stirring. The invention is illustrated with the help of following examples which are merely illustrative and should not be construed to limit the scope of invention.

Qualitative description, viscosity, extrudability, spreadibility and consistency tests of these formulations were conducted by taking the marketed formulation povidone-iodine ointment as the standard drug. Test results of the above formulations were found close to the respective test results of the marketed formulation. The new formulations were subjected to accelerated stability testing study as per ICH guidelines. The formulations were evaluated for colour, texture, pH, phase separation and assay (%) over the test period of 6 months. All the formulations were found stable over the entire test period. Skin irritation study was conducted as per the OECD guideline using Formulation No. 1. Healthy young adult male albino rabbits were used in the study. No sign of skin reactions like erythema and oedema formation were observed on the skin of albino rabbits. Similarly, no negative irritant response like alopecia, hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia and scaling were observed. In-vivo wound healing activity study through excision wound model: 18 male albino wistar rats weighing 150 - 200 gm were used for the study. The experimental protocol was subjected to the scrutiny of the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee and was cleared by the same before starting the experimental activity. The rats were divided into three groups, each group having six rats. They were inflicted with excision wound under light ether anesthesia. Group-I rats were left untreated (control group), group-II rats were treated with market formulation povidone iodine ointment (standard group) and group-ill rats were treated with the Formulation No. 1 (test group). The parameters studied were percentage of ORiOiNAL wound contraction and period of epithelialization (number of days required for falling of the eschar without any residual raw wound). The data obtained were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and were subjected to least significant difference post hoc test (LSD). The result of the study indicated that the test formulation enhanced wound healing in open wound. Both the standard and test groups showed better wound healing pattern as compared to the control group. Statistical observations showed that there was a significant reduction in wound area from day 4 onwards in the test and standard group. On later days the wound closure rate was much faster than with the control group. Complete wound healing in the standard and test groups occurred at around 20-22 days followed by fall of eschar. Histopathological examination of the wound tissues was conducted to assess the rate of wound healing. In this examination keratinization, epithelization, collagen content, fibroblast, blood vessels, hair follicles and sweat glands formation in the regenerated tissue of each group was observed with the help of microscope. The results of histopathological examination of the regenerated tissue of test group showed almost equal and comparable results with that of the standard group. On the basis of the above results, it was concluded that the new formulation according to the present invention possess significant wound healing activity. Wound healing formulation according to the present invention offers the following advantages: 1. Eco-friendly: The formulation of the present invention comprises all ingredients from the natural origin therefore, it is eco-friendly. It is biodegradable, non-polluting and non-toxic in nature. 2. Free from paraffin: Paraffins are one of the most common ingredients in the topical semisolid products. They are obtained from petroleum and are available as hard paraffin, liquid paraffin (mineral oil or liquid petrolatum), white soft paraffin (white petroleum jelly) and yellow soft paraffin (yellow petroleum jelly). Research studies have however, indicated that the use of paraffins in topical products may cause skin cancer. Looking at the potential risk involved with the use of paraffins, the formulation according to the present invention is free from any paraffin ingredient. 3. Stable and effective: The formulation according to the present invention is physically and chemically stable and is very effective in wound healing. 4. It has a smooth texture and spreads evenly and smoothly when applied on the affected parts. 5. It is non-irritating, non-gritty and non-staining in nature. 6. Water removable: After application to the skin, the formulation can be easily removed from the skin thus it does not cause any inconvenience to the patient. 1.
