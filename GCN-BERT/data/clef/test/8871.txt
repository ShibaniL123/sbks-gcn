BACKGROUND Cervical cancer is a fatal disease if not detected and treated early. 99.7% of cervical cancer cases are etiologically associated with at least one of 15-18 oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (4-6). Over 85% of cervical cancer occurs in developing countries and other historically underserved low-resource populations where it is the leading cause of death from cancer among women (1). Most high-grade cervical cancer can be prevented if pre-cancerous lesions or early-stage cervical cancer becomes diagnosed and treated. At present, pre-cancerous lesions or early-stage cervical cancer can be detected using inexpensive screening methods, such as visual inspection of the cervix using acetic acid (vinegar) or Lugol's solution (iodine), or by using a new and affordable HPV-DNA test (careHPV, Qiagen) that can detect 14 high-risk types of HPV. However, there is a lack of affordable therapies for pre-cancerous cervical dysplasia. The costly and invasive therapies currently in use (cryotherapy, cone biopsies and loop electrosurgical excision procedure) all require both an established clinical infrastructure as well as highly trained medical personnel typically in the form of a dedicated gynecologic oncology service. Such resources are unavailable to large high-risk populations who have neither the economic means nor transportation options to access such clinical services. Thus, while limitations to screening in low resource settings appear to have been adequately addressed, there remains an unmet and urgent global need for an alternative therapy for those who have positive test results. The remaining challenge is to create a novel therapy for pre-cancerous cervical dysplastic lesions caused by high-risk types of HPV and prevent their progression to carcinoma in situ and/or invasive cervical cancer. Such a therapy should be inexpensive, easily self-administered or readily applied with assistance by a trained healthcare worker in a local clinic, and be effective as a single dose therapy that can be used in a single visit “screen, treat and prevent” public healthcare model that can be implemented even in the most impoverished populations where extremes of temperature may exist, space is limited and running water and electricity are unavailable. BRIEF SUMMARY The present invention provides novel co-polymer and drug penetration-enhancer formulations as a non-invasive delivery system for direct topical delivery of one or more chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cervical dysplasia aimed at preventing progression to carcinoma in situ and/or invasive cervical cancer. Advantageously, the co-polymer/enhancer formulations of the present invention are thermo-sensitive, mucoadhesive or dermoadhesive, and enhance the penetration of small and large therapeutically active compounds such as proteins greater than 52 amino acids across normal or diseased skin (transdermal delivery) or mucosa (transmucosal delivery). These properties facilitate the delivery of stable and active compounds contained in such co-polymer/enhancer formulations with properties that allow them to be solid phase at room temperature for ease of insertion and directed application to the cervical transformation zone, instantly melt at physiological temperature, adhere to mucosa and enhance the penetration of a chemotherapeutic drug across the entire dysplastic squamous epithelium. In a preferred embodiment, the co-polymer/enhancer formulations comprise a mixture of poloxamer 188 (P188), propylene glycol (PG) and laurocapram (LP) that can be customized and optimized for the delivery of one or more therapeutic agents or compounds. In addition, the present invention provides uses of co-polymer/enhancer formulations for thermo-sensitive, dermoadhesive or mucoadhesive and penetration-enhanced topical delivery of a broad range of compounds to treat both neoplastic and non-neoplastic proliferative lesions of the skin or mucosal surfaces. In certain embodiments, the co-polymer/enhancer formulation of the present invention enhances delivery of therapeutic agents across normal or diseased skin or mucosal surfaces including, but not limited to, cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, rectum, eye, ear, oral cavity, nasopharynx, larynx, and head and neck for topical therapy. In one embodiment, the present invention can be used for treatment of neoplastic and non-neoplastic proliferative diseases including, but not limited to, HPV-associated cervical lesions such as pre-cancerous low-grade cervical dysplasia including cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stage I or II (CIN I, CIN II) and high-grade dysplasia (CIN III); vulvar cancer; vaginal cancer or tumor; endometrial cancer; laryngeal carcinoma; head and neck cancer; skin cancer; skin tags; common HPV-associated warts of the hands, feet and extremities; and psoriasis. In one embodiment, the present invention may be used as a transdermal or transmucosal deliver system (or device) for small and large therapeutic compounds and biomolecules into subcutaneous or submucosal tissue, or into the systemic circulation as an alternative to subcutaneous injections with needles or intravenous delivery with indwelling catheters.

Intense staining of mucoadherent FITC-conjugated *Br1 is observed on the mucosal surface of both cervical canals and uterine horns. Intense staining shows that FITC-conjugated *Br1 melts and adheres to the mucosal surface of the cervical transformation zone spanning the endocervical canal and endocervix leading to both uterine horns. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEQUENCES SEQ ID NO: 1 is an amino acid sequence of a TRIP-Br1 decoy peptide (*Br1). SEQ ID NO: 2 is an amino acid sequence of a TRIP-Br2 decoy peptide (*Br2). DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides co-polymer/enhancer formulations for topical and transdermal or transmucosal delivery of compounds. Advantageously, the co-polymer/enhancer formulations of the present invention are thermo-sensitive, mucoadhesive or dermoadhesive, and enhance the penetration of therapeutics across skin or mucosal surfaces. Also provided are therapeutic uses of the co-polymer/enhancer co-polymer/enhancer formulations for topical treatment of cancer, including cervical cancer. In a preferred embodiment, the delivery system comprises co-polymers of poloxamer 188 (P188) and propylene glycol, the penetration-enhancer laurocapram and, optionally, one or more therapeutic agents. In a preferred embodiment, the delivery formulation of the present invention can be used for topical delivery of large cytotoxic peptides, such as TRIP-Br decoy peptides including the TRIP-Br1 decoy peptide (*Br1) and/or the TRIP-Br2 decoy peptide (*Br2). TRIP-Br decoy peptides target disruption of the TRIP-Br integrator function at E2F-responsive promoters, which induces a novel mechanism of cell death in proliferating cells (8-10); therefore, topical delivery of the TRIP-BR decoy peptides according to the present invention not only provides local therapy of pre-cancerous cervical dysplasia, but also prevents progression of pre-cancerous conditions to cervical cancer. As demonstrated in the Example, the co-polymer/enhancer formulations of the present invention are thermo-sensitive; that is, solid at room temperature for ease of insertion into the cervical transformation zone and instantly melt at physiological temperature. Furthermore, the co-polymer/enhancer formulations adhere to and enhance peptide penetration across cervical mucosa. In one embodiment, the present invention can be used for topical therapy of human HPV-associated low-grade cervical dysplasia defined cytologically as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stage I or II (CIN I, CIN II) or for high-grade dysplasia (CIN III) to prevent progression to carcinoma in situ (CIS) and invasive cervical cancer (11). Advantageously, the co-polymer/enhancer formulations of the present invention allow for non-invasive, targeted delivery of therapeutics across the skin and mucosal surfaces. Additionally, the present co-polymer/enhancer formulations use safe, inexpensive ingredients, are easy to administer and are suitable for use in a wide range of clinical settings. The co-polymer/enhancer formulations can easily be administered by healthcare workers or by self-administration by the patient, and under conditions of extreme temperature, high humidity, poor lighting, lack of space or lack of adequate supply of electricity or water.

Treatment of Cancer Via Topical Delivery of Therapeutics Another aspect of the invention provides methods for enhanced delivery of therapeutic agents across the skin and/or mucosal surface. Preferably, the present invention enhances topical, non-invasive delivery of a broad range of small and large therapeutic agents of various classes and compositions as well as physicochemical properties (e.g. peptides, proteins, chemicals, nucleic acids), such as but not limited to cytotoxic decoy peptides, other chemotherapeutics and anti-tumor/anti-cancer agents, drugs for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, prevention and treatment of thrombotic and pro-thrombotic conditions, and antigens for the induction of a protective immune response to various vaccine antigens, as disclosed above. In one embodiment the method comprises administering, to skin or mucosal surface of a subject, a co-polymer/enhancer formulation of the present invention. In a specific embodiment the method comprises administering, to skin or mucosal surface of a subject, a co-polymer/enhancer formulation comprising poloxamer 188 and propylene glycol, laurocapram and, optionally, one or more therapeutic agents. The term “subject,” as used herein, describes an organism, including mammals such as primates, to which treatment with the formulations according to the subject invention can be provided. Mammalian species that can benefit from the disclosed methods of treatment include, but are not limited to, apes, chimpanzees, orangutans, humans, monkeys; and domesticated animals such as dogs, cats, horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, chickens, mice, rats, guinea pigs, and hamsters. In certain embodiments the co-polymer/enhancer formulation of the present invention is administered to skin or mucosal surfaces including, but not limited to, cervix, vagina, anus, rectum, eye, ear, nose, thorax, vulva, larynx, and head and neck. In one embodiment the co-polymer/enhancer formulation of the present invention is topically administered to cervical dysplastic lesions of the ectocervix and proximal endocervical canal of women via an intravaginal route of mucosal delivery. In one embodiment the present invention allows for topical delivery of therapeutics across keratinized apical layer of skin (stratum corneum) and/or mucosa. In another embodiment the present invention allows for topical delivery of therapeutics across non-keratinized surface of skin and/or mucosa. In one embodiment the present invention allows for topical delivery of therapeutics into, or across, multiple layers of cervical squamous epithelial cells. In one embodiment the present invention allows for topical delivery of therapeutics to the basal keratinocytes of skin and/or mucosa. In a specific embodiment the present invention can be used to deliver therapeutics to penetrate the keratinized surface of the mouse cervical transformation zone. In a specific embodiment the present invention can be used to deliver therapeutics to penetrate non-keratinized human cervical transformation zone (T-zone) across multiple layers of squamous epithelial cells to reach the basal keratinocytes where HPV viral integration occurs. As exemplified in the Example, the co-polymer/enhancer formulations of the present invention can deliver moderate sized peptides across the keratinized apical layer of mouse cervical T-zone. Mouse cervical transformation zone differs from that of human. Mouse cervix is completely internalized, whereas human has an ectocervix located on the vaginal surface. In addition, mouse cervix has a keratizined apical layer in the cervical T-zone, which begins from the vagino-cervical junction and ends at the squamo-columnar junction. Cervical T-zone is where most cervical cancers arise. The mouse keratinized cervical epithelium is comparable to keratinized skin. As exemplified in the Example, the co-polymer/enhancer formulation is capable of topical delivery and penetration of a 38 amino acid cytotoxic peptide across the mouse keratinized cervical squamous epithelium. In certain embodiments, the present invention can be used for topical delivery of therapeutics across the keratin-rich, stratum corneum of skin to treat cutaneous neoplastic and non-neoplastic proliferative diseases including, but not limited to, HPV-associated pre-cancerous and cancerous conditions affecting vulva, vagina, anus, larynx, and head and neck, and melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma associated with Epstein-Barr Virus infection and psoriasis. In one embodiment the present invention can be used for topical delivery of chemotherapeutic and anti-cancer/anti-tumor agents for treatment of tumor or cancer including, but not limited to, human HPV-associated cervical cancer and its precursor lesions, such as pre-cancerous low-grade cervical dysplasia classified as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stage I or II (CIN I, CIN II), high-grade dysplasia (CIN III), carcinoma in situ (CIS) and locally invasive or metastatic cervical cancer (11); prostate cancer; ovarian cancer; vulvar cancer; vaginal cancer or tumor; endometrial cancer; laryngeal carcinoma; nasal pharyngeal carcinoma; bladder cancer; nasopharyngeal carcinoma, skin cancer; and head and neck cancer. In certain embodiments the present invention can be used for topical, non-invasive delivery of therapeutics for treatment of diseases or conditions, including hyperplastic skin lesions, such as, genital warts, psoriasis and keloids. In certain embodiments the present invention can be used as a non-invasive topical transdermal or transmucosal delivery system (or device) applied to normal skin or mucosal surfaces to obviate the need for subcutaneous injection of therapeutic compounds. Formulations and Formulations for Topical Administration The subject invention also provides for therapeutic or pharmaceutical formulations comprising the co-polymer/enhancer formulation in a form that can be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a preferred embodiment the therapeutic or pharmaceutical formulation is solid or semi-solid at room temperature and melts at a temperature slightly below desired physiological temperatures. The term “carrier” refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient or vehicle with which the compound is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum oil such as mineral oil, vegetable oil such as peanut oil, soybean oil and sesame oil, animal oil or oil of synthetic origin. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The therapeutic formulation, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting, emulsifying or pH buffering agents. These formulations can take the form of creams, foam, patches, lotions, drops, sprays, gel, oils, aerosol, powders, ointment, solutions, suspensions, emulsion and the like. The formulation can be formulated with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences” by E. W. Martin. Such formulations contain a therapeutically effective amount of the therapeutic formulation, together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration. The subject invention also provides for the modification of the ingredient such that it is more stable once administered to a subject, i.e., once administered it has a longer time period of effectiveness as compared to the unmodified form. Such modifications are well known to those of skill in the art, e.g., microencapsulation, etc. The amount of the therapeutic or pharmaceutical formulation of the invention which is effective in the treatment of a particular disease, condition or disorder will depend on the route of administration and the seriousness of the disease, condition or disorder and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Further, the present invention provides kits containing therapeutic agents such as, lyophilized cytotoxic decoy peptides, vehicle and/or co-polymer/enhancer formulations. Preferably, the formulations of the present invention are stable in a wide range of temperatures below the desired melting temperature. In one embodiment the active therapeutic agents can be reconstituted by mixing pre-measured quantities of each component immediately prior to use. EXAMPLES Following are examples that illustrate procedures for practicing the invention. These examples should not be construed as limiting. All percentages are by weight and all solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted. Example 1 Thermo-Sensitive, Mucoadhesive, and Penetration-Enhancing Formulations To create co-polymer/enhancer formulations with desired thermo-sensitive properties, USP grade poloxamer 188 (P188) and propylene glycol (PG) were mixed at various ratios (100/0, 80/20, 70/30, 50/50 and 0/100) and heated to 60° C. The co-polymer/enhancer preparations were suctioned into pre-warmed (60° C.) Silastic tubing (⅛th-inch inner diameter; Fisher, Pittsburgh, Pa.), solidified at room temperature and extruded from the tube with compressed air (12). 3 mm samples were cut from the solid “rope” with a scalpel. The thermal profile of the P188/PG co-polymer preparations was determined using a DSC 6200/Exstar 6000 (Seiko Instruments) Differential Scanning calorimeter. To obtain co-polymer preparations that have the desired melting point (30-37° C.) in the presence of 1 mM of various decoy peptides, DSC 6200 was programmed with 3 cycles of heating at 10° C./min and cooling at 50° C./min, with 2 min equilibration times between heating/cooling cycles. Measurements were taken at a temperature range of −25-65° C. The DSC curves did not exhibit dual peaks, indicating that the P188/PG co-polymer preparations were in a homogeneous phase. The co-polymer with an 80/20 ratio of P188/PG exhibited the desired thermal property, that is, solid at room temperature and instantly melted at a temperature slightly below the physiological temperature of 37° C. The P188/PG (80/20 ratio) co-polymer was then used to deliver FITC-tagged 38 amino acid cytotoxic decoy peptides. The P188/PG co-polymer (80/20 ratio) alone was unable to penetrate the keratinized apical layer of the mouse cervix, as determined by direct visualization using fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). Laurocapram is a non-toxic enhancer of cutaneous penetration (13, 14). It is among a class of “penetration modifiers” (15, 16) that, depending on the vehicle formulation, can enhance or retard the penetration of human stratum corneum. DSC and spectral analysis revealed that penetration modifier formulations (e.g., laurocapram) disrupt and fluidize the stratum corneum lipid bilayers (17). Since 1984, laurocapram has been widely used as a safe penetration enhancer and has been formulated with propylene glycol—a mucoadhesive and dermoadhesive agent (17, 18). 0.4 M laurocapram (17) was added to the P188/PG preparations. The DSC curves (FIG. 1) show that the formulation composed of 1 mM of the cytotoxic decoy peptide *Br1, a 70/30 ratio of P188/PG co-polymer and 0.4 M laurocapram has the desired thermo-sensitive properties for delivery of cytotoxic decoy peptides (delivery of *Br2 is not shown). As shown below, this new formulation can enhance penetration of cytotoxic decoy peptides across the keratinized surface of mouse cervical mucosa, which resembles the stratum corneum of skin. The entire mouse cervical T-zone begins from the cervico-vaginal junction to the termination of the cervical T-zone, which is approximately one-third of the distance into one of the 2 cervical/uterine horns. To achieve topical delivery of decoy peptides into the entire mouse cervical T-zone, a solid FITC-tagged decoy peptide-containing co-polymer/enhancer rod was manually delivered into the endocervical canal and into one of the 2 cervical/uterine horns of a 7 month old K14E6 homozygous female transgenic mouse expressing the HPV type 16 E6 oncoprotein that synergizes with 17β-estradiol to induce low-grade dysplasia (CIN I, II) in situ that closely mimics the step-wise development of human cervical cancer; the “untreated” cervical served as an internal control. After animals were anesthetized, a “speculum” comprised of a standard P-100 pipette tip with the tip cut off at the midpoint along its length was inserted into the vagina to expose the opening of the cervical canal. A three-fourth inch long, 24-gauge catheter (Teruma Surflush; inner diameter 0.47 mm) with the trocar removed was fit onto a compatible P-10 micropipette. The catheter was loaded with the peptide-containing, liquid co-polymer/enhancer formulation to a length that approximates the entire cervical T-zone and extends across the squamo-columnar junction into the uterine horn. After the co-polymer/enhancer formulation solidified into rod shape at room temperature, the tip of the catheter was inserted into the entrance of the cervix, and the solid rod was pushed into the cervical canal by the trocar; meanwhile, the catheter tip was withdrawn so that, at the end of the procedure, the rod protruded ˜2 mm outside of the cervical canal. It is observed that the co-polymer/enhancer formulation underwent phase transition from a solid rod into a consistent gel-like formulation, without leakage from the cervical opening. Six hours after peptide delivery the animals were euthanized. The entire reproductive tract was surgically removed, fixed with formalin and embedded for histological sectioning as described (19). 1 mM FITC-conjugated *Br1 was used for direct visualization of peptide delivery by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence microscopy showed that both formulations, which contain P188 and PG, are mucoadhesive to the keratinized apical surface. FIG. 2 shows a direct comparison between the penetration property of the lauracopram-containing and the non-lauracopram-containing formulation in a single mouse reproductive tract. A rod consisting of the 80/20 P188/PG formulation (without lauracopram) was introduced high up into the right cervical/uterine horn under ultrasound guidance, while a rod consisting of the 70/30 formulation and 0.4M lauracopram was introduced into the left cervical/uterine horn. Specifically, penetration across the apical keratin layer of cervical squamous epithelium was only observed in the left cervical/uterine horn, where the rod contained 0.4 M lauracopram (FIG. 2B, 2B′). It is evident that the lauracopram-containing rod penetrated through multiple layers of cervical squamous epithelial cells, when comparing fluorescence microscopic imaging of an unstained section (FIG. 2B) with light microscopic examination of a consecutive H&E stained section (FIG. 2A).
