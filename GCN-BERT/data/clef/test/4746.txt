CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT/JP2012/077372 filed Oct. 23, 2012, claiming priority based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-249949 filed Nov. 15, 2011, the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. FIELD OF ART The present invention relates to a compound for copper patterning useful in the fields of electronics and the like, as well as copper patterns formed with the same and a method of producing the same. BACKGROUND ART Techniques have recently been attracting attention for printing, such as ink jet or screen printing, with a metallic ink on a flexible plastic substrate, followed by sintering, to form desired conductive patterns. The metallic ink used here is desired to sinter at lower temperatures below the heat resistance temperature of the plastic substrate. As such metallic inks for conductive patterning, silver- or copper-containing inks that are sintering at lower temperatures have widely been developed. Among them, copper has advantages over silver for its more excellent electrical characteristics and lower price. As the inks for copper patterning, there are known inks in which copper carboxylate is used as the copper material (Non-patent Publications 1 and 2) and in which copper fine particles are dispersed (Patent Publications 1 and 2). Since copper is prone to oxidation, sintering of such inks is often performed in a reducing atmosphere, such as of hydrogen or formic acid, which causes safety problems in industrialization. In addition, the sintering temperature is as high as 250° C. or higher, and thus can be applied to only some types of plastic substrates. In order to solve these problems, there are proposed inks achieving low-temperature sintering, such as the one disclosed in Non-patent Publication 3, which is composed of copper formate, amine, and a solvent. This ink is made into a copper pattern by sintering at 120 to 160° C. in nitrogen atmosphere. However, sintering of such conventional copper ink which contains an organic copper compound or copper fine particles as a copper material may result in shrinkage of the printed film, and the sintered pattern may be different from the desired, as-printed pattern. On the other hand, it has been reported that materials containing organic components, which decompose and vaporize at lower temperatures, are useful in inks such as those on plastic substrates, which need to be sintered at lower temperatures. As such compounds, silver β-ketocarboxylate compounds are known, which are reported to be capable of silver patterning at lower temperatures (Patent Publication 3). As a corresponding copper compound exhibiting similar decomposition mechanism, a copper β-ketocarboxylate compound may be envisaged. Copper β-ketocarboxylate compounds have been studied over a long time, and used as a polymerization catalyst or a silver reducing agent (Patent Publication 4, Non-patent Publications 4 and 5). However, these compounds have never been used as a material for copper patterning, partly because copper is more prone to oxidation than silver, and conductive copper patterns cannot be obtained by techniques similar to those for the silver β-ketocarboxylate compounds.

When neither Component C-1 nor C-2 is contained, oxidation due to decomposition products of Component A may proceed during sintering to increase the volume resistivity of the resulting pattern. The composition for copper patterning according to the present invention may optionally contain other raw copper materials, solvents, or known additives as needed, as long as the effects of the present invention are not impaired. In order to improve the copper concentration of the composition for copper patterning, copper fine particles having a particle size of 3 nm to 500 nm, or copper filler having a particle size on the order of micrometers may be added as the other raw copper materials.

The copper pattern according to the present invention may be obtained by, for example, a method of the present invention including printing with the composition for copper patterning of the present invention on a substrate, and sintering at 120 to 250° C. in an inert gas atmosphere. The copper pattern according to the present invention is a pattern printed by various printing process into an arbitrary shape, which may be selected depending on applications. For example, solid pattern, line pattern, hole pattern, or dot pattern may be employed. The printing process may be conventional, such as screen printing, roll coating, air-knife coating, blade coating, bar coating, gravure coating, die coating, slide coating, or ink jet coating. The substrate on which the printing with the composition for copper patterning of the present invention is to be done may be, for example, a plastic substrate such as those made of polyimide, polyester, epoxy resin, bismaleimide-triazine resin, modified polyphenylene ether, ABS resin, polyamide, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, or a fluororesin; a glass substrate such as those made of soda glass, borosilicate glass, silica glass, or quartz glass; or a wired substrate having metallic traces such as those made of gold, silver, copper, or aluminum. The substrate may have been treated with primer or plasma, or by etching, for improving adhesion. The inert gas used in the sintering may be, for example, helium, nitrogen, or argon gas. The sintering temperature may vary according to the kind of the substrate, and may be at any temperature as long as it is not higher than the heat resistance temperature of the substrate and not lower than the temperature at which the organic components in the composition for copper patterning of the present invention vaporizes, and is usually 120 to 250° C. At a sintering temperature of lower than 120° C., the organic components in the composition for copper patterning remains in the resulting copper pattern, which may cause increase in the volume resistivity. At a sintering temperature over 250° C., the heat resistance temperature of some substrate may be exceeded, so that the sintering cannot be carried out. The duration of sintering, which depends on the sintering temperature, may be of any length as long as the organic components in the composition for copper patterning of the present invention vaporize sufficiently, and is usually 1 to 120 minutes, preferably 3 to 60 minutes. The copper pattern produced in accordance with the present invention may be in any desired pattern formed by various printing process, and may be formed into a conductive body having a volume resistivity of not higher than 1×103 μΩ·cm. Such copper pattern is useful in the field of electronics.

Next, the films were sintered at the sintering temperatures in the atmospheres shown in Table 3 in a heating furnace (SMT-SCOPE manufactured by SANYO SEIKO KABUSHIKI KAISHA) for 20 minutes to obtain copper patterns (solid films) having a film thickness of 1 μm. The nitrogen atmosphere was established by flowing nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 1 L/min in the heating furnace. Each of the copper patterns was evaluated for volume resistivity and shrinkage. The results are shown in Table 3. The volume resistivity was measured with a four-point probe method (trade name “LORESTA GP” manufactured by MITSUBISHI CHEMICAL CORPORATION).

Further, these copper patterns exhibited little shrinkage after sintering, and thus may be formed into desired shapes by various printing processes. It is also seen that the copper patterns obtained in Examples 2-25 to 2-35 from the compositions for copper patterning containing copper fine particles had volume resistivities of 7.3 to 802.4 μΩ·cm and may thus be used as conductive bodies, and exhibited little shrinkage after sintering and thus may be formed into desired shapes by various printing processes. Comparative Examples 2-1 to 2-8 Production of Copper Pattern Copper patterns (solid films) were produced using the compositions prepared in Examples 1-5 and Comparative Examples 1-1 to 1-6 under the conditions shown in Table 4 in the same way as in Example 2. The evaluations of the volume resistivity and shrinkage were carried out in the same way as in Example 2. The results are shown in Table 4. The copper patterns which had high volume resistivities of 1×108 μΩ·cm or higher and could not be used as conductive bodies were not evaluated for shrinkage.

Ex. 2-8 Ex. 1-5 PEN 100 Nitrogen >108 — From Table 4, it is seen that the copper patterns obtained in Comparative Examples 2-1 and 2-2 exhibited shrinkage of not less than 5% upon sintering, so that when desired films were formed by printing or the like process, the desired patterns could not be obtained due to shrinkage after sintering. It is also seen that the copper patterns obtained in Comparative Examples 2-3 to 2-8 had high volume resistivities of 1×108 μΩ·cm or higher, and thus could not be used as conducive bodies. Example 3 Production of Copper Pattern by Ink Jet Printing Ink jet printing was carried out using the composition for copper patterning prepared in Example 1-13. As an ink jet printer, DMP-2831 (Dimatix-Fujifilm Ink, USA) was used, and as an ink jet cartridge, DMC-11610 (Dimatix-Fujifilm Ink, USA) was used. A film in a line pattern of 2 mm×20 mm was produced on PI under the ejection conditions of a frequency of 5 kHz, voltage of 18 V, and a cartridge temperature of 60° C., with the distance of 1 mm between the cartridge head and the substrate and the dot spacing of 20 μm. Then the film was sintered at 200° C. for 20 minutes in an nitrogen atmosphere in a heating furnace (SMT-SCOPE manufactured by SANYO SEIKO KABUSHIKI KAISHA) to produce a copper pattern (line pattern). The nitrogen atmosphere was established by flowing nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 1 L/min in the heating furnace. The volume resistivity of the obtained copper pattern was measured in the same way as in Example 2-1, and found to be 6.5 μΩ·cm. No breaking by shrinkage was observed. Comparative Example 3 Production of Copper Pattern by Ink Jet Printing Ink jet printing was carried out in the same way as in Example 3 except that the composition for copper patterning prepared in Example 1-13 was replaced with the composition for copper patterning prepared in Comparative Example 1-1, and the resulting coated film was sintered to obtain a copper pattern (line pattern). The obtained copper pattern was observed to have breaking due to shrinkage, which made it impossible to measure the volume resistivity. Examples 4-1 to 4-4 Production of Copper Pattern by Dispenser Printing Dispenser printing was carried out using each of the compositions for copper patterning prepared in Examples 1-5, 1-24, 1-25, and 1-28. As a dispenser printer, SHOT mini, ML-606GX manufactured by MUSASHI ENGINEERING CO., LTD. was used, with the needle diameter of 0.1 mm and the distance of 0.1 mm between the dispenser head and the substrate, to produce a film in a line pattern of 30 mm long on a PI substrate. The film thickness was controlled by regulating the discharge pressure so that the sintered film thickness was 1 μm. The sintering was carried out at 200° C. for 20 minutes in a nitrogen atmosphere in a heating furnace (SMT-SCOPE manufactured by SANYO SEIKO KABUSHIKI KAISHA) to obtain a copper pattern (line pattern). The nitrogen atmosphere was established by flowing nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 1 L/min in the heating furnace. The line width of the obtained copper patterns was measured and the results are shown in Table 5. TABLE 5 Composition for Line width copper patterning (mm) Example 4-1 Example 1-5 2.0 Example 4-2 Example 1-24 1.0 Example 4-3 Example 1-25 0.4 Example 4-4 Example 1-28 0.2 From Table 5, it is seen that in Examples 4-2 to 4-4, wherein the copper concentration and the viscosity of the compositions for copper patterning were high due to the addition of copper fine particles, the wetting of the line patterns were inhibited, and the lines could be made thinner even in the production of patterns of the same film thickness. Incidentally, all the copper patterns had volume resistivities on the order of 10 μΩ·cm or lower, and the conductivity was maintained. 1.
