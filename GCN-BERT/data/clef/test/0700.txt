ENHANCER OF ZESTE HOMOLOG 2 INHIBITORS FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to compounds which inhibit Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (ΕΖΗ2) and thus are useful for inhibiting the proliferation of and/or inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Epigenetic modifications play an important role in the regulation of many cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival. Global epigenetic modifications are common in cancer, and include global changes in DNA and/or histone methylation, dysregulation of non-coding RNAs and nucleosome remodeling leading to aberrant activation or inactivation of oncogenes, tumor suppressors and signaling pathways. However, unlike genetic mutations which arise in cancer, these epigenetic changes can be reversed through selective inhibition of the enzymes involved. Several methylases involved in histone or DNA methylation are known to be dysregulated in cancer. Thus, selective inhibitors of particular methylases will be useful in the treatment of proliferative diseases such as cancer. ΕΖΗ2 (human ΕΖΗ2 gene: Cardoso, C, et al; European Jof Human Genetics, Vol. 8, No. 3 Pages 174-180, 2000) is the catalytic subunit of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2) which functions to silence target genes by tri-methylating lysine 27 of histone Η3 (Η3Κ27ΐη℮3). Histone Η3 is one of the five main histone proteins involved in the structure of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Featuring a main globular domain and a long N-terminal tail, Histones are involved with the structure of the nucleosomes, a 'beads on a string' structure. Histone proteins are highly post-translationally modified however Histone Η3 is the most extensively modified of the five histones. The term "Histone H3" alone is purposely ambiguous in that it does not distinguish between sequence variants or modification state. Histone Η3 is an important protein in the emerging field of epigenetics, where its sequence variants and variable modification states are thought to play a role in the dynamic and long term regulation of genes. Increased ΕΖΗ2 expression has been observed in numerous solid tumors including those of the prostate, breast, skin, bladder, liver, pancreas, head and neck and correlates with cancer aggressiveness, metastasis and poor outcome (Varambally et al., 2002; Kleer et al., 2003; Breuer et al., 2004; Bachmann et al., 2005; Weikert et al., 2005; Sudo et al., 2005; Bachmann et al., 2006). For instance, there is a greater risk of recurrence after prostatectomy in tumors expressing high levels of ΕΖΗ2, increased metastasis, shorter disease-free survival and increased death in breast cancer patients with high ΕΖΗ2 levels (Varambally et al., 2002; Kleer et al., 2003). More recently, inactivating mutations in UTX (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeats X), a Η3Κ27 demethylase which functions in opposition to ΕΖΗ2, have been identified in multiple solid and hematological tumor types (including renal, glioblastoma, esophageal, breast, colon, non-small cell lung, small cell lung, bladder, multiple myeloma, and chronic myeloid leukemia tumors), and low UTX levels correlate with poor survival in breast cancer suggesting that loss of UTX function leads to increased Η3Κ27ΐη℮3 and repression of target genes (Wang et al., 2010). Together, these data suggest that increased Η3Κ27ΐη℮3 levels contribute to cancer aggressiveness in many tumor types and that inhibition of ΕΖΗ2 activity may provide therapeutic benefit. Numerous studies have reported that direct knockdown of ΕΖΗ2 via siRNA or shRNA or indirect loss of ΕΖΗ2 via treatment with the SAH hydrolase inhibitor 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) decreases cancer cell line proliferation and invasion in vitro and tumor growth in vivo (Gonzalez et al., 2008, GBM 2009). While the precise mechanism by which aberrant ΕΖΗ2 activity leads to cancer progression is not known, many ΕΖΗ2 target genes are tumor suppressors suggesting that loss of tumor suppressor function is a key mechanism. In addition, ΕΖΗ2 overexpression in immortalized or primary epithelial cells promotes anchorage independent growth and invasion and requires ΕΖΗ2 catalytic activity (Kleer et al., 2003; Cao et al., 2008). Thus, there is strong evidence to suggest that inhibition of ΕΖΗ2 activity decreases cellular proliferation and invasion. Accordingly, compounds that inhibit ΕΖΗ2 activity would be useful for the treatment of cancer.

Salts of the disclosed compounds containing a carboxylic acid or other acidic functional group can be prepared by reacting with a suitable base. Such a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be made with a base which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation, which includes alkali metal salts (especially sodium and potassium), alkaline earth metal salts (especially calcium and magnesium), aluminum salts and ammonium salts, as well as salts made from physiologically acceptable organic bases such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, morpholine, pyridine, piperidine, picoline, dicyclohexylamine, A(AP-dibenzylethylenediamine, 2-hydroxyethylamine, bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, tri-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, procaine, dibenzylpiperidine, dehydroabietylamine, Ν,№ -A/.sdehy droabi ety 1 amiη℮, glucamine, A'-methylglucamine, collidine, quinine, quinoline, and basic amino acid such as lysine and arginine. Other salts, which are not pharmaceutically acceptable, may be useful in the preparation of compounds of this invention and these should be considered to form a further aspect of the invention. These salts, such as oxalic or trifluoroacetate, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be useful in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The compound of Formula (I) or a salt thereof may exist in stereoisomeric forms (e.g., it contains one or more asymmetric carbon atoms). The individual stereoisomers (enantiomers and diastereomers) and mixtures of these are included within the scope of the present invention. Likewise, it is understood that a compound or salt of Formula (I) may exist in tautomeric forms other than that shown in the formula and these are also included within the scope of the present invention. It is to be understood that the present invention includes all combinations and subsets of the particular groups defined hereinabove. The scope of the present invention includes mixtures of stereoisomers as well as purified enantiomers or enantiomerically/diastereomerically enriched mixtures. It is to be understood that the present invention includes all combinations and subsets of the particular groups defined hereinabove. The subject invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in Formula (I) and following, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, such as 2H, 3H, UC, 13C, 14C, 15N, 170, 180,31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, 36C1, 123I, and 125I. Compounds of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds that contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of the present invention. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H, 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. UC and 18F isotopes are particularly useful in PET (positron emission tomography), and 125I isotopes are particularly useful in SPECT (single photon emission computerized tomography), all useful in brain imaging. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of Formula (I) and following of this invention can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. The invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition (also referred to as pharmaceutical formulation) comprising a compound of Formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and one or more excipients (also referred to as carriers and/or diluents in the pharmaceutical arts). The excipients are acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof (i.e., the patient). Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients will vary depending upon the particular dosage form chosen. In addition, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for a particular function that they may serve in the composition. For example, certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to facilitate the production of uniform dosage forms. Certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to facilitate the production of stable dosage forms. Certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to facilitate the carrying or transporting of the compound or compounds of the invention once administered to the patient from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to enhance patient compliance. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include the following types of excipients: diluents, fillers, binders, disintegrants, lubricants, glidants, granulating agents, coating agents, wetting agents, solvents, co-solvents, suspending agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, flavoring agents, flavor masking agents, coloring agents, anticaking agents, hemectants, chelating agents, plasticizers, viscosity increasing agents, antioxidants, preservatives, stabilizers, surfactants, and buffering agents. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may serve more than one function and may serve alternative functions depending on how much of the excipient is present in the formulation and what other ingredients are present in the formulation. Skilled artisans possess the knowledge and skill in the art to enable them to select suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients in appropriate amounts for use in the invention. In addition, there are a number of resources that are available to the skilled artisan which describe pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and may be useful in selecting suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Examples include Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Company), The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives (Gower Publishing Limited), and The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (the American Pharmaceutical Association and the Pharmaceutical Press). The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are prepared using techniques and methods known to those skilled in the art. Some of the methods commonly used in the art are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Company). Pharmaceutical compositions may be in unit dose form containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. Such a unit may contain a therapeutically effective dose of the compound of Formula (I) or salt thereof or a fraction of a therapeutically effective dose such that multiple unit dosage forms might be administered at a given time to achieve the desired therapeutically effective dose. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient. Furthermore, such pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared by any of the methods well-known in the pharmacy art. Pharmaceutical compositions may be adapted for administration by any appropriate route, for example, by oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual, or transdermal), vaginal, or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, or intradermal) routes. Such compositions may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example, by bringing into association the active ingredient with the excipient(s). When adapted for oral administration, pharmaceutical compositions may be in discrete units such as tablets or capsules; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; oil-in-water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil liquid emulsions. The compound or salt thereof of the invention or the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may also be incorporated into a candy, a wafer, and/or tongue tape formulation for administration as a “quick-dissolve” medicine. For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Powders or granules are prepared by comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing with a similarly comminuted pharmaceutical carrier such as an edible carbohydrate, as, for example, starch or mannitol. Flavoring, preservative, dispersing, and coloring agents can also be present. Capsules are made by preparing a powder mixture, as described above, and filling formed gelatin or non-gelatinous sheaths. Glidants and lubricants such as colloidal silica, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, solid polyethylene glycol can be added to the powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrating or solubilizing agent such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, or sodium carbonate can also be added to improve the availability of the medicine when the capsule is ingested. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars, such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth, sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methylcellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum, and the like. Tablets are formulated, for example, by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and disintegrant, and pressing into tablets. A powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound, suitably comminuted, with a diluent or base as described above, and optionally, with a binder such as carboxymethylcellulose, and aliginate, gelatin, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a solution retardant such as paraffin, a resorption accelerator such as a quaternary salt, and/or an absorption agent such as bentonite, kaolin, or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting a binder such as syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage, or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials and forcing through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be run through the tablet machine and the result is imperfectly formed slugs broken into granules. The granules can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc, or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The compound or salt of the present invention can also be combined with a free-flowing inert carrier and compressed into tablets directly without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A clear opaque protective coating consisting of a sealing coat of shellac, a coating of sugar, or polymeric material, and a polish coating of wax can be provided. Dyestuffs can be added to these coatings to distinguish different dosages. Oral fluids such as solutions, syrups, and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit form so that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of active ingredient. Syrups can be prepared by dissolving the compound or salt thereof of the invention in a suitably flavoured aqueous solution, while elixirs are prepared through the use of a non-toxic alcoholic vehicle. Suspensions can be formulated by dispersing the compound or salt of the invention in a non-toxic vehicle. Solubilizers and emulsifiers, such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxyethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavor additives such as peppermint oil, natural sweeteners, saccharin, or other artificial sweeteners, and the like, can also be added. Where appropriate, dosage unit formulations for oral administration can be microencapsulated. The formulation can also be prepared to prolong or sustain the release as, for example, by coating or embedding particulate material in polymers, wax, or the like. In the present invention, tablets and capsules are preferred for delivery of the pharmaceutical composition. In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition comprising mixing (or admixing) a compound of Formula (I) or salt thereof with at least one excipient. The present invention also provides a method of treatment in a mammal, especially a human. The compounds and compositions of the invention are used to treat cellular proliferation diseases. Disease states which can be treated by the methods and compositions provided herein include, but are not limited to, cancer (further discussed below), autoimmune disease, fungal disorders, arthritis, graft rejection, inflammatory bowel disease, proliferation induced after medical procedures, including, but not limited to, surgery, angioplasty, and the like. It is appreciated that in some cases the cells may not be in a hyper or hypo proliferation state (abnormal state) and still requires treatment. For example, during wound healing, the cells may be proliferating "normally", but proliferation enhancement may be desired. Thus, in one embodiment, the invention herein includes application to cells or individuals afflicted or impending affliction with any one of these disorders or states.

By the term "co-administering" and derivatives thereof as used herein refers to either simultaneous administration or any manner of separate sequential administration of an ΕΖΗ2 inhibiting compound, as described herein, and a further active ingredient or ingredients, known to be useful in the treatment of cancer, including chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The term further active ingredient or ingredients, as used herein, includes any compound or therapeutic agent known to or that demonstrates advantageous properties when administered to a patient in need of treatment for cancer. Preferably, if the administration is not simultaneous, the compounds are administered in a close time proximity to each other. Furthermore, it does not matter if the compounds are administered in the same dosage form, e.g. one compound may be administered topically and another compound may be administered orally. Typically, any anti-neoplastic agent that has activity versus a susceptible tumor being treated may be co-administered in the treatment of specified cancers in the present invention. Examples of such agents can be found in Cancer Principles and Practice of Oncology by V.T. Devita and S. Heilman (editors), 6th edition (February 15, 2001), Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers. A person of ordinary skill in the art would be able to discern which combinations of agents would be useful based on the particular characteristics of the drugs and the cancer involved. Typical anti-neoplastic agents useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, anti-microtubule agents such as diterpenoids and vinca alkaloids; platinum coordination complexes; alkylating agents such as nitrogen mustards, oxazaphosphorines, alkyl sulfonates, nitrosoureas, and triazenes; antibiotic agents such as anthracyclins, actinomycins and bleomycins; topoisomerase II inhibitors such as epipodophyllotoxins; antimetabolites such as purine and pyrimidine analogues and anti-folate compounds; topoisomerase I inhibitors such as camptothecins; hormones and hormonal analogues; DNA methyltransferase inhibitors such as azacitidine and decitabine; signal transduction pathway inhibitors; non-receptor tyrosine kinase angiogenesis inhibitors; immunotherapeutic agents; proapoptotic agents; and cell cycle signaling inhibitors. Typically, any chemotherapeutic agent that has activity against a susceptible neoplasm being treated may be utilized in combination with the compounds the invention, provided that the particular agent is clinically compatible with therapy employing a compound of the invention. Typical anti-neoplastic agents useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to: alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, antitumor antibiotics, antimitotic agents, nucleoside analogues, topoisomerase I and II inhibitors, hormones and hormonal analogues; retinoids, histone deacetylase inhibitors; signal transduction pathway inhibitors including inhibitors of cell growth or growth factor function, angiogenesis inhibitors, and serine/threonine or other kinase inhibitors; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors; antisense therapies and immunotherapeutic agents, including monoclonals, vaccines or other biological agents. Nucleoside analogues are those compounds which are converted to deoxynucleotide triphosphates and incorporated into replicating DNA in place of cytosine. DNA methyltransferases become covalently bound to the modified bases resulting in an inactive enzyme and reduced DNA methylation. Examples of nucleoside analogues include azacitidine and decitabine which are used for the treatment of myelodysplastic disorder. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors include vorinostat, for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. HDACs modify chromatin through the deacetylation of histones. In addition, they have a variety of substrates including numerous transcription factors and signaling molecules. Other HD AC inhibitors are in development. Signal transduction pathway inhibitors are those inhibitors which block or inhibit a chemical process which evokes an intracellular change. As used herein this change is cell proliferation or differentiation or survival. Signal transduction pathway inhibitors useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases, non-receptor tyrosine kinases, SH2/SH3 domain blockers, serine/threonine kinases, phosphatidyl inositol-3-OH kinases, myoinositol signaling, and Ras oncogenes. Signal transduction pathway inhibitors may be employed in combination with the compounds of the invention in the compositions and methods described above. Receptor kinase angiogenesis inhibitors may also find use in the present invention. Inhibitors of angiogenesis related to VEGFR and TIE-2 are discussed above in regard to signal transduction inhibitors (both are receptor tyrosine kinases). Other inhibitors may be used in combination with the compounds of the invention. For example, anti-VEGF antibodies, which do not recognize VEGFR (the receptor tyrosine kinase), but bind to the ligand; small molecule inhibitors of integrin (alphav betas) that inhibit angiogenesis; endostatin and angiostatin (non-RTK) may also prove useful in combination with the compounds of the invention. One example of a VEGFR antibody is bevacizumab (AVASTIN®). Several inhibitors of growth factor receptors are under development and include ligand antagonists, antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-sense oligonucleotides and aptamers. Any of these growth factor receptor inhibitors may be employed in combination with the compounds of the invention in any of the compositions and methods/uses described herein. Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) is an example of an anti-erbB2 antibody inhibitor of growth factor function. One example of an anti-erbBl antibody inhibitor of growth factor function is cetuximab (Erbitux™, C225). Bevacizumab (Avastin®) is an example of a monoclonal antibody directed against VEGFR. Examples of small molecule inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptors include but are not limited to lapatinib (Tykerb®) and erlotinib (TARCEVA®). Imatinib mesylate (GLEEVEC®) is one example of a PDGFR inhibitor. Examples of VEGFR inhibitors include pazopanib (Votrient®), ZD6474, AZD2171, ΡΤΚ787, sunitinib and sorafenib. Anti-microtubule or anti-mitotic agents are phase specific agents active against the microtubules of tumor cells during Μ or the mitosis phase of the cell cycle. Examples of anti-microtubule agents include, but are not limited to, diterpenoids and vinca alkaloids. Diterpenoids, which are derived from natural sources, are phase specific anti cancer agents that operate at the G2/M phases of the cell cycle. It is believed that the diterpenoids stabilize the P-tubulin subunit of the microtubules, by binding with this protein. Disassembly of the protein appears then to be inhibited with mitosis being arrested and cell death following. Examples of diterpenoids include, but are not limited to, paclitaxel and its analog docetaxel. Paclitaxel, 5P,20-epoxy-l,2a,4,7P,10P,13a-hexa-hydroxytax-l 1-℮η-9-οη℮ 4,10-diacetate 2-benzoate 13-ester with (2A3V)-A-benzoyl-3-phenylisoserine; is a natural diterpene product isolated from the Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia and is commercially available as an injectable solution TAXOL®. It is a member of the taxane family of terpenes. It was first isolated in 1971 by Wani etal. J. Am. Chem, Soc., 93:2325 (1971), who characterized its structure by chemical and X-ray crystallographic methods. One mechanism for its activity relates to paclitaxel's capacity to bind tubulin, thereby inhibiting cancer cell growth. Schiff et al., Proc. Natl, Acad, Sci. USA, 77:1561-1565 (1980); Schiff et al., Nature, 277:665-667 (1979); Kumar, J. Biol, Chem, 256: 10435-10441 (1981). For a review of synthesis and anticancer activity of some paclitaxel derivatives see: D. G. I. Kingston et al., Studies in Organic Chemistry vol. 26, entitled “New trends in Natural Products Chemistry 1986”, Attaur-Rahman, P.W. Le Quesne, Eds. (Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1986) ρρ 219-235. Paclitaxel has been approved for clinical use in the treatment of refractory ovarian cancer in the United States (Markman et al., Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine, 64:583, 1991; McGuire et al., Ann. Int. Med., 111:273,1989) and for the treatment of breast cancer (Holmes et al., J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 83:1797,1991.). It is a potential candidate for treatment of neoplasms in the skin (Einzig et. al., Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol., 20:46) and head and neck carcinomas (Forastire et. al., Sem. Oncol., 20:56, 1990). The compound also shows potential for the treatment of polycystic kidney disease (Woo et. al., Nature, 368:750. 1994), lung cancer and malaria. Treatment of patients with paclitaxel results in bone marrow suppression (multiple cell lineages, Ignoff, R. J. et. al, Cancer Chemotherapy Pocket Guide., 1998) related to the duration of dosing above a threshold concentration (50ηΜ) (Kearns, C.M. et. al., Seminars in Oncology, 3(6) p.16-23, 1995). Docetaxel, (2R,3S)- A-carboxy-3-phenylisoserine A-/er/-butyl ester, 13-ester with 5P-20-epoxy-l,2a,4,7P,10P,13a-hexahydroxytax-l 1-℮η-9-οη℮ 4-acetate 2-benzoate, trihydrate; is commercially available as an injectable solution as TAXOTERE®. Docetaxel is indicated for the treatment of breast cancer. Docetaxel is a semisynthetic derivative of paclitaxel q.v., prepared using a natural precursor, 10-deacetyl-baccatin III, extracted from the needle of the European Yew tree. The dose limiting toxicity of docetaxel is neutropenia. Vinca alkaloids are phase specific anti-neoplastic agents derived from the periwinkle plant. Vinca alkaloids act at the Μ phase (mitosis) of the cell cycle by binding specifically to tubulin. Consequently, the bound tubulin molecule is unable to polymerize into microtubules. Mitosis is believed to be arrested in metaphase with cell death following. Examples of vinca alkaloids include, but are not limited to, vinblastine, vincristine, and vinorelbine. Vinblastine, vincaleukoblastine sulfate, is commercially available as VELBAN® as an injectable solution. Although, it has possible indication as a second line therapy of various solid tumors, it is primarily indicated in the treatment of testicular cancer and various lymphomas including Hodgkin’s Disease; and lymphocytic and histiocytic lymphomas. Myelosuppression is the dose limiting side effect of vinblastine. Vincristine, vincaleukoblastine, 22-οχο-, sulfate, is commercially available as ONCOVIN® as an injectable solution. Vincristine is indicated for the treatment of acute leukemias and has also found use in treatment regimens for Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s malignant lymphomas. Alopecia and neurologic effects are the most common side effect of vincristine and to a lesser extent myelosupression and gastrointestinal mucositis effects occur. Vinorelbine, 3’,4’-didehydro -4’-deoxy-C’-norvincaleukoblastine [R-(R*,R*)-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioate (l:2)(salt)], commercially available as an injectable solution of vinorelbine tartrate (NAVELBINE®), is a semisynthetic vinca alkaloid. Vinorelbine is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, in the treatment of various solid tumors, particularly non-small cell lung, advanced breast, and hormone refractory prostate cancers. Myelosuppression is the most common dose limiting side effect of vinorelbine. Platinum coordination complexes are non-phase specific anti-cancer agents, which are interactive with DNA. The platinum complexes enter tumor cells, undergo aquation and form intra- and interstrand crosslinks with DNA causing adverse biological effects to the tumor. Examples of platinum coordination complexes include, but are not limited to, cisplatin and carboplatin. Cisplatin, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, is commercially available as PLATINOL® as an injectable solution. Cisplatin is primarily indicated in the treatment of metastatic testicular and ovarian cancer and advanced bladder cancer. The primary dose limiting side effects of cisplatin are nephrotoxicity, which may be controlled by hydration and diuresis, and ototoxicity. Carboplatin, platinum, diammine [l,l-cyclobutane-dicarboxylate(2-)-0,0’], is commercially available as PARAPLATIN® as an injectable solution. Carboplatin is primarily indicated in the first and second line treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma. Bone marrow suppression is the dose limiting toxicity of carboplatin. Alkylating agents are non-phase anti-cancer specific agents and strong electrophiles. Typically, alkylating agents form covalent linkages, by alkylation, to DNA through nucleophilic moieties of the DNA molecule such as phosphate, amino, sulfhydryl, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and imidazole groups. Such alkylation disrupts nucleic acid function leading to cell death. Examples of alkylating agents include, but are not limited to, nitrogen mustards such as cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and chlorambucil; alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan; nitrosoureas such as carmustine; and triazenes such as dacarbazine. Cyclophosphamide, 2-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H-l,3,2-oxazaphosphorine 2-oxide monohydrate, is commercially available as an injectable solution or tablets as CYTOXAN®. Cyclophosphamide is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, in the treatment of malignant lymphomas, multiple myeloma, and leukemias. Alopecia, nausea, vomiting and leukopenia are the most common dose limiting side effects of cyclophosphamide. Melphalan, 4-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]-L-phenylalanine, is commercially available as an injectable solution or tablets as ALKERAN®. Melphalan is indicated for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and non-resectable epithelial carcinoma of the ovary. Bone marrow suppression is the most common dose limiting side effect of melphalan. Chlorambucil, 4-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]benzenebutanoic acid, is commercially available as LEUKERAN® tablets. Chlorambucil is indicated for the palliative treatment of chronic lymphatic leukemia, and malignant lymphomas such as lymphosarcoma, giant follicular lymphoma, and Hodgkin’s disease. Bone marrow suppression is the most common dose limiting side effect of chlorambucil. Busulfan, 1,4-butanediol dimethanesulfonate, is commercially available as MYLERAN® TABLETS. Busulfan is indicated for the palliative treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Bone marrow suppression is the most common dose limiting side effects of busulfan. Carmustine, l,3-[bis(2-chloroethyl)-l-nitrosourea, is commercially available as single vials of lyophilized material as BiCNU®. Carmustine is indicated for the palliative treatment as a single agent or in combination with other agents for brain tumors, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin’s disease, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Delayed myelosuppression is the most common dose limiting side effects of carmustine.

Dacarbazine is indicated for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma and in combination with other agents for the second line treatment of Hodgkin’s Disease. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia are the most common dose limiting side effects of dacarbazine. Antibiotic anti-neoplastics are non-phase specific agents, which bind or intercalate with DNA. Typically, such action results in stable DNA complexes or strand breakage, which disrupts ordinary function of the nucleic acids leading to cell death. Examples of antibiotic anti-neoplastic agents include, but are not limited to, actinomycins such as dactinomycin, anthrocyclins such as daunorubicin and doxorubicin; and bleomycins. Dactinomycin, also known as Actinomycin D, is commercially available in injectable form as COSMEGEN®. Dactinomycin is indicated for the treatment of Wilm’s tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia are the most common dose limiting side effects of dactinomycin. Daunorubicin, (8S-cis-)-8-acetyl-10-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-a-L-lyxo-hexopyranosyl)oxy]-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,8,11 -trihydroxy-1 -methoxy-5,12 naphthacenedione hydrochloride, is commercially available as a liposomal injectable form as DAUNOXOME® or as an injectable as CERUBIDINE®. Daunorubicin is indicated for remission induction in the treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and advanced HIV associated Kaposi’s sarcoma. Myelosuppression is the most common dose limiting side effect of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin, (8S, 10S)-10-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-a-L-lyxo-hexopyranosyl)oxy]-8-glycoloyl, 7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,8,l l-trihydroxy-l-methoxy-5,12 naphthacenedione hydrochloride, is commercially available as an injectable form as RUBEX® or ADRIAMYCIN RDF®. Doxorubicin is primarily indicated for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloblastic leukemia, but is also a useful component in the treatment of some solid tumors and lymphomas. Myelosuppression is the most common dose limiting side effect of doxorubicin. Bleomycin, a mixture of cytotoxic glycopeptide antibiotics isolated from a strain of Streptomyces verticillus, is commercially available as BLENOXANE®. Bleomycin is indicated as a palliative treatment, as a single agent or in combination with other agents, of squamous cell carcinoma, lymphomas, and testicular carcinomas. Pulmonary and cutaneous toxicities are the most common dose limiting side effects of bleomycin. Topoisomerase II inhibitors include, but are not limited to, epipodophyllotoxins. Epipodophyllotoxins are phase specific anti-neoplastic agents derived from the mandrake plant. Epipodophyllotoxins typically affect cells in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle by forming a ternary complex with topoisomerase II and DNA causing DNA strand breaks. The strand breaks accumulate and cell death follows. Examples of epipodophyllotoxins include, but are not limited to, etoposide and teniposide. Etoposide, 4’-demethyl-epipodophyllotoxin 9[4,6-0-(R)-ethylidene-P-Dglucopyranoside], is commercially available as an injectable solution or capsules as VePESID® and is commonly known as VP-16. Etoposide is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents in the treatment of testicular and non-small cell lung cancers. Myelosuppression is the most common side effect of etoposide. The incidence of leukopenialeukopenia tends to be more severe than thrombocytopenia. Teniposide, 4’-demethyl-epipodophyllotoxin 9[4,6-0-(R)-thenylidene-P-Dglucopyranoside], is commercially available as an injectable solution as VUMON® and is commonly known as VM-26. Teniposide is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents in the treatment of acute leukemia in children. Myelosuppression is the most common dose limiting side effect of teniposide. Teniposide can induce both leukopenialeukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Antimetabolite neoplastic agents are phase specific anti-neoplastic agents that act at S phase (DNA synthesis) of the cell cycle by inhibiting DNA synthesis or by inhibiting purine or pyrimidine base synthesis and thereby limiting DNA synthesis. Consequently, S phase does not proceed and cell death follows. Examples of antimetabolite anti-neoplastic agents include, but are not limited to, fluorouracil, methotrexate, cytarabine, mecaptopurine, thioguanine, and gemcitabine. 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluoro-2,4- (1Η,3Η) pyrimidinedione, is commercially available as fluorouracil. Administration of 5-fluorouracil leads to inhibition of thymidylate synthesis and is also incorporated into both RNA and DNA. The result typically is cell death. 5-fluorouracil is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents in the treatment of carcinomas of the breast, colon, rectum, stomach and pancreas. Myelosuppression and mucositis are dose limiting side effects of 5-fluorouracil. Other fluoropyrimidine analogs include 5-fluoro deoxyuridine (floxuridine) and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate. Cytarabine, 4-amino-l-P-D-arabinofuranosyl-2 (1 //)-pyri midi none, is commercially available as CYTOSAR-U® and is commonly known as Ara-C. It is believed that cytarabine exhibits cell phase specificity at S-phase by inhibiting DNA chain elongation by terminal incorporation of cytarabine into the growing DNA chain. Cytarabine is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents in the treatment of acute leukemia. Other cytidine analogs include 5-azacytidine and 2’,2’ -difluorodeoxycytidiη℮ (gemcitabine). Cytarabine induces leukopenialeukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mucositis. Mercaptopurine, l,7-dihydro-6H-purine-6-thione monohydrate, is commercially available as PURINETHOL®. Mercaptopurine exhibits cell phase specificity at S-phase by inhibiting DNA synthesis by an as of yet unspecified mechanism. Mercaptopurine is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents in the treatment of acute leukemia. Myelosuppression and gastrointestinal mucositis are expected side effects of mercaptopurine at high doses. A useful mercaptopurine analog is azathioprine. Thioguanine, 2-amino-l,7-dihydro-6H-purine-6-thione, is commercially available as TABLOID®. Thioguanine exhibits cell phase specificity at S-phase by inhibiting DNA synthesis by an as of yet unspecified mechanism. Thioguanine is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents in the treatment of acute leukemia. Myelosuppression, including leukopenialeukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, is the most common dose limiting side effect of thioguanine administration. However, gastrointestinal side effects occur and can be dose limiting. Other purine analogs include pentostatin, erythrohydroxynonyladenine, fludarabine phosphate, and cladribine. Gemcitabine, 2’-deoxy-2’, 2’-difluorocytidine monohydrochloride (P-isomer), is commercially available as GEMZAR@. Gemcitabine exhibits cell phase specificity at S-phase and by blocking progression of cells through the Gl/S boundary. Gemcitabine is indicated in combination with cisplatin in the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer and alone in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Myelosuppression, including leukopenialeukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, is the most common dose limiting side effect of gemcitabine administration. Methotrexate, /V-[4[[(2,4-diamino-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoyl]-Lglutamic acid, is commercially available as methotrexate sodium. Methotrexate exhibits cell phase effects specifically at S-phase by inhibiting DNA synthesis, repair and/or replication through the inhibition of dyhydrofolic acid reductase which is required for synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Methotrexate is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents in the treatment of choriocarcinoma, meningeal leukemia, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and carcinomas of the breast, head, neck, ovary and bladder. Myelosuppression (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) and mucositis are expected side effect of methotrexate administration. Camptothecins, including, camptothecin and camptothecin derivatives are available or under development as Topoisomerase I inhibitors. Camptothecins cytotoxic activity is believed to be related to its Topoisomerase I inhibitory activity. Examples of camptothecins include, but are not limited to irinotecan, topotecan, and the various optical forms of 7-(4-methylpiperazino-methylene)-10,l l-ethylenedioxy-20-camptothecin described below. Irinotecan HC1, (4S)-4,1 l-diethyl-4-hydroxy-9-[(4-piperidinopiperidino) carbonyloxy]-lH-pyrano[3’,4’,6,7]indolizino[l,2-b]quinoline-3,14(4H,12H)-dione hydrochloride, is commercially available as the injectable solution CAMPTOSAR®. Irinotecan is a derivative of camptothecin which binds, along with its active metabolite SN-38, to the topoisomerase I - DNA complex. It is believed that cytotoxicity occurs as a result of irreparable double strand breaks caused by interaction of the topoisomerase I: DNA : irintecan or SN-38 ternary complex with replication enzymes. Irinotecan is indicated for treatment of metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum. The dose limiting side effects of irinotecan HC1 are myelosuppression, including neutropenia, and GI effects, including diarrhea. Topotecan HC1, (S)-10-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-4-ethyl-4,9-dihydroxy-lH-pyrano[3’,4’,6,7]indolizino[l,2-b]quinoline-3,14-(4H,12H)-dione monohydrochloride, is commercially available as the injectable solution HYCAMTIN®. Topotecan is a derivative of camptothecin which binds to the topoisomerase I - DNA complex and prevents religation of singles strand breaks caused by Topoisomerase I in response to torsional strain of the DNA molecule. Topotecan is indicated for second line treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the ovary and small cell lung cancer. The dose limiting side effect of topotecan HC1 is myelosuppression, primarily neutropenia. Pharmaceutical compositions may be presented in unit dose forms containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. Such a unit may contain, for example, 0.5 mg to 1 g, preferably 1 mg to 700 mg, more preferably 5 mg to 100 mg of a compound of the Formula (I), depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration and the age, weight and condition of the patient, or pharmaceutical compositions may be presented in unit dose forms containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. Preferred unit dosage compositions are those containing a daily dose or sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient. Furthermore, such pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmacy art. Pharmaceutical compositions may be adapted for administration by any appropriate route, for example by the oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual or transdermal), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intradermal) route. Such compositions may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example by bringing into association a compound of formal (I) with the carrier(s) or excipient(s). Pharmaceutical compositions adapted for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; or oil-in-water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil liquid emulsions. Capsules are made by preparing a powder mixture, as described above, and filling formed gelatin sheaths. Glidants and lubricants such as colloidal silica, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate or solid polyethylene glycol can be added to the powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrating or solubilizing agent such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate or sodium carbonate can also be added to improve the availability of the medicament when the capsule is ingested. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like. Tablets are formulated, for example, by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and disintegrant and pressing into tablets. A powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound, suitably comminuted, with a diluent or base as described above, and optionally, with a binder such as carboxymethylcellulose, an aliginate, gelatin, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a solution retardant such as paraffin, a resorption accelerator such as a quaternary salt and/or an absorption agent such as bentonite, kaolin or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be granulated by tablet forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The compounds of the present invention can also be combined with a free flowing inert carrier and compressed into tablets directly without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A clear or opaque protective coating consisting of a sealing coat of shellac, a coating of sugar or polymeric material and a polish coating of wax can be provided. Dyestuffs can be added to these coatings to distinguish different unit dosages. Oral fluids such as solution, syrups and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit form so that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of a compound of Formula (I). Syrups can be prepared by dissolving the compound in a suitably flavored aqueous solution, while elixirs are prepared through the use of a non-toxic alcoholic vehicle. Suspensions can be formulated by dispersing the compound in a non-toxic vehicle. Solubilizers and emulsifiers such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxy ethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavor additive such as peppermint oil or natural sweeteners or saccharin or other artificial sweeteners, and the like can also be added. Where appropriate, dosage unit pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be microencapsulated. The formulation can also be prepared to prolong or sustain the release as for example by coating or embedding particulate material in polymers, wax or the like. Pharmaceutical compositions adapted for rectal administration may be presented as suppositories or as enemas. Pharmaceutical compositions adapted for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the composition isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the pharmaceutical compositions may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention will depend upon a number of factors including, for example, the age and weight of the intended recipient, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, the nature of the formulation, and the route of administration, and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant prescribing the medication. However, an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) for the treatment of anemia will generally be in the range of 0.001 to 100 mg/kg body weight of recipient per day, suitably in the range of .01 to 10 mg/kg body weight per day. For a 70 kg adult mammal, the actual amount per day would suitably be from 7 to 700 mg and this amount may be given in a single dose per day or in a number (such as two, three, four, five or six) of sub-doses per day such that the total daily dose is the same. An effective amount of a salt or solvate, etc., may be determined as a proportion of the effective amount of the compound of Formula (I) per se. It is envisaged that similar dosages would be appropriate for treatment of the other conditions referred to above. DEFINITIONS Terms are used within their accepted meanings. The following definitions are meant to clarify, but not limit, the terms defined. As used herein, the term "alkyl" represents a saturated, straight or branched hydrocarbon moiety having the specified number of carbon atoms. The term "(Ci-C6)alkyl" refers to an alkyl moiety containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.
