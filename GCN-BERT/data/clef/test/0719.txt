FIFLD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to fan-shape interfolding apparatuses wherein several webs are simul¬ taneously folded.and interfolded along fold lines extending in the machine direction while the webs are being drawn through the apparatus in side-by-side, partially overlapped relation. Such fan-shâpe interfolding apparatuses (herein¬ after referred to as parallel-type interfolders) are thus distinguishable from folding appartuses wherein webs are folded along fold lines extending transverse the machine direction, and from apparatuses wherein several webs are serially or sequentially interfolded. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Prior art parallel-type interfolders and accordian pleating apparatuses are known which comprise sufficient folding guides that all folds are positively made about a machine member. Such apparatuses having a fan-shape array of elongate guides are exemplified by U.S. Patent No. 1,122,511 which issued December 29, 1914 to Solomon Lazar; U.S. Patent No. 3,038,718 which issued June 12, 1962 to Maurice M. Balsam; U.S. Patent No. 3,784,186 which issued January 8, 1974 to Robert Lenthall et al.; and U.S. Patent No. 3,850,425 which issued November 26, 1974 to Nicholas Marcalus et al. A parallel type interfolding apparatus comprising guides having saw-tooth shape apertures through or between machine members is exemplified by U.S. Patent No. Re 12,204 which issued March 15, 1904 to Edwin D. Casterline. U.S. Patent No. 3,536,317 which issued October 27, 1970 to Ronald J. Billett interfolds wide sheets from parent rolls and slits them into facial tissue or napkin widths after the sheets have been interfolded by being passed between longitudinally extending guides. These and other known interfolders commonly have problems such as access to machine members and adjustments, maintaining sufficient visible contact with the material-in-process for assuring quality control, and sufficiently controlling the folding and bundle formation to continuously and reliably produce square-cornered bundles of unwrinkled product. However, none of the discovered prior art interfolding apparatuses has solved the problems associated with interfolding in the manner nor to the degree of the present invention. For instance, in interfolding apparatuses comprising oppositely disposed guides, some guide members must be opened or moved to initially thread the webs therebetween whereas apparatuses embodying the present invention have no such oppositely disposed folding guides. That is, all of the webs being interfolded in an -V. ig; apparatus embodying the present invention are drawn across the top of a fan-shape folding table; not between elongate members or through saw-tooth apertures. Moreover, the preferred embodiment of the present invention has, as is described fully hereinafter, slitters which make slits visible to the machine operators, adjustable guide rollers for maintaining bundle squareness, and other improvements with respect to prior art apparatuses. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION The nature and substance of the invention will be more readily appreciated after giving consideration to its major aims and purposes. The principal objects of the invention are recited in the ensuing paragraphs in order to provide a better appreciation of its important aspects prior to describing the details of a preferred embodiment in later portions of this description. A major object of the present invention is to provide a parallel-type interfolding apparatus wherein a multiplicity of webs of material such as facial tissue are associated to form a straight sided, square cornered, endless bundle of substantially unwrinkled webs which can be severed into discrete bundles and packaged in pop-up dispensing cartons. Another major object of the invention is to provide the parallel-type interfolding apparatus described in the preceding paragraph wherein the multiplicity of webs are provided by slitting a plurality of parent rolls of the material in the machine direction. A further object of the invention is to provide a parallel-type interfolding apparatus as described above in which a high degree of visible contact can be maintained with the material being interfolded therein. ¥et another object of the invention is to provide parallel-type interfolding apparatuses as described above in which folding guide members do not have to be moved to initially loop the'webs about and/or across the guide members. A still further object of the invention is to provide parallel-type interfolding apparatuses as described above which can be adjusted easily to enable interfolding fan-shape arrays of webs which arrays are disposed symmetrically or asymmetrically with respect to the centerline of the apparatus. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The above and other objects are achieved in accordance with one aspect of the present invention by providing an apparatus comprising an arcuate array of hackstands for rotatably supporting and unwinding parent rolls of sheet material, slitting means for converting the sheet material into a multiplicity of webs, means for juxtapositioning the webs in partially overlapped relation, and means for causing the webs to be drawn in converging relation across a fan-shape folding table comprising a set of elongate guides having inverted V-shape cross sections and thence drawing the converged webs about a turning guide having an axis. Means are provided for tilting the axis of the turning guide so that the webs can be caused to track along the ridges and V-shape troughs of the folding table. The apparatus may further comprise a second turning guide and means for tilting its axis so that, by adjusting the tilt of both axes, square-corners can be maintained on the endless bundle drawn between the two turning guides.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring now to the drawings, and particularly to Figures 1 and 2, a preferred embodiment of the present invention is identified as interfolder 40 or, alternatively, interfolding apparatus 40 which comprises a frame 41, seven hackstands 42, unwind drive 43, coupler shafts 44, an arcuate guide 47, a fan-shape folding table 48 comprising a set of elongate guides 49, turning guide means 50 comprising a pair of guide rollers 51, 52, draw means 53, controller 54, and control cables 54a. Each backstand 42 comprises ply-bonding and slitting means 45, two juxtapositioning idler rolls 56, 57, and a pre-arc roller 46. The interfolder 40 enables directly converting a plurality of parent rolls of flexible, somewhat elastic sheet material such as creped, two-ply facial tissue paper into an endless bundle 59 comprising a multiplicity of interfolded webs. The endless bundle 59 can subsequently be severed by suitable downstream apparatus (not shown) into discrete bundles and packaged in pop-up dispensing cartons. Briefly, sheets 60a, 60b, Figure 2, of flexible material are unwound by drive 43 from a plurality of upper and lower parent rolls 61a, 61b, respectively, mounted in the hackstands 42, and the sheets are drawn through the interfolder by draw means 53. While being drawn through the interfolder, the sheets are ply bonded and slit in the machine direction by means 45, prior to being interfolded, whereby the sheets are converted into a multiplicity of webs 62a, 62b in side-by-side, parallel running relation. The webs are juxtaposed in half- overlapped relation. Figures 4 and 18, by virtue of having the upper parent rolls 60a axially offset from the lower parent rolls 61b, Figure 1, and by passing the webs over pre-arc rollers 46 which are disposed at graduated elevations as shown in Figures 3 and 4. The half-overlapped webs, 62a and 62b, Figure 2 are then looped under the arcuate guide 47 whereupon they are directed to converge and pass across the folding table 48 and thence between the guide rollers 51, 52. The relative dispositions of the arcuate guide 47, the elongate guides 49 of folding table 48, and the guide rollers 51, 52 cause the superjacent webs 62a, Figure 4, to be folded downwardly about the ridges 64, Figures 6 through 11, of the elongate guides 49 of the folding table 48, and cause the subjacent webs 62b, Figure 4, to be folded upwardly in V-shape troughs 65, Figures 12, 13 and 14, formed intermediate adjacent elongate guides 49. Thus, all of the webs 62 are folded along longitudinally extending hinge lines so that each overlapped fold (each half) of each web is disposed between the two folds or halves of the adjacent web, Figure 18. Controller 54, Figure 1, is provided to enable driving the plybonder anvil rolls 80, Figure 2, at a controlled peripheral velocity, to enable unwinding the parent rolls through the use of tension sensing means 70, 71 so that all of the parent rolls are unwound under nominal yet positive predetermined uniform tension in the machine direction, and to control the draw means 53 to provide a predetermined nominal , elongation of the somewhat elastic webs 62a, 62b intermediate the ply-bonding and slitting means 45 and the draw means 53. As constructed, an exemplary preferred apparatus embodi¬ ment. Figures 1 and 2, comprises means for interfolding symmetrical as well as asymmetrical arrays of as many as one-hundred-forty webs which webs are provided by longitudinally slitting sheets unwound from fourteen parent rolls disposed in seven two-high . hackstands. However, the preferred embodiment apparatus as described herein is used for interfolding an asymmetrical array of one-hundred-twenty-six webs which are provided by slitting twelve whole parent rolls and two narrow parent rolls which are three-tenths as wide as whole parent rolls. The- array of one-hundred-twenty-six webs is asymmetrical-because, by placing the narrow parent rolls in the right-end hackstand. Figure 1, seventy webs are disposed on the left side of the centerline 58 of the interfolder 40 while only fifty-six webs are disposed on the right side of the centerline 58 of the Interfolder. Each hackstand 42, Figure 2, comprises a portion of frame 41, shafts 69 for rotatably mounting an upper parent roll 61a and a lower parent roll 61b in frame 41, tension sensing means 70, 71, idler rolls 72, 73, and spreader rolls 74, 75. The shafts 69 are disposed so that the upper and lower parent rolls 61a, 61b, respectively. Figure 1, are axially offset causes the webs of width W slit therefrom to be juxtaposed in half-overlapped relation upon passing juxtapositioning rolls 56, 57 as is described more fully hereinafter. Sideshift units', not shown, are also provided in the hackstands 42 to enable positioning the parent rolls axially on shafts 69 to assure proper registration with the downstream ply-bonding and slitting means 45. Tension sensing means 70 and 71 each comprise two idler rolls 77, 78, a tension responsive, movable dancer roll 79 and means not shown for converting the position and movement of dancer roll 79 into input signals to controller 54 via a control cable 54a, Figure 1, so that all of the sheets 60 are unwound under uniform nominal tension in the machine direction. Each hackstand 42 further comprises a peripheryi- drive unwind means 83, Figure 2, for each parent roll comprising a drive pulley 85, idler pulleys 86 through 90 inclusive, a takeup pulley 96, two transversely spaced drive belts 91 (only one shown in Figure 2) looped about the pulleys and a peripheral portion of the parent roll as shown in Figure 2, and a constant tension air cylinder 92. Pressurized air, regulated by means not shown, is applied to the tension air cylinder 92 to retract its piston rod 93 and takeup pulley 96 as a parent roll 61 of sheet material is payed out so that an arcuate portion of each drive belt 91 is continuously maintained in driving relation with a peripheral segment of the parent roll. Ply-bonding and slitting means 45, Figure 2, are also provided in each hackstand 42 to longitudinally slit each sheet 60a' 60b into a plurality of side-by-side webs and to compressively bond the plies of each multi-ply sheet together adjacent the longitudinally extending edges of each web. Each ply-bonding and slitting means 45, Figure 2, comprises a plybonder anvil roll 80, a plurality of plybonder ,20 wheels 80a, means (not shown) for selectively biasing the wheels 80a against the anvil roll 80 or spacing the wheels 80a from the anvil roll 80, a slitter anvil roll 81, a Plurality of circular slitter knives 81a, and means (not shown) for selectively positioning the slitter knives 81a in co- i25 operating relation with the slitter anvil roll 81 or spacing the wheels 81a from the slitter anvil roll 81. Each slitting means 4 5 is provided with means not shown for controllably enabling and foregoing slitting. The capability of foregoing slitting is particularly use¬ ful because unslit sheets can be looped through the apparatus to initially thread the apparatus rather than having to loop the entire multiplicity of discrete webs through the machine. Moreover, by slitting each sheet into a number of discrete webs before interfolding occurs, the slitting can be visually monitored to assure good quality control. Furthermore, an advantage of slitting a plurality of parent rolls into a multiplicity of webs is that only a plurality of tension sensing means and associated controls are required as opposed -to a number of tension sensing and control means equal to the number of webs. For instance, in the preferred embodiment apparatus, only fourteen tension sensing means 70, 71, Figure 2, are required as opposed to one-hundred-twenty-six which would otherwise be required. Indeed, if whole parent rolls were installed in all seven hackstands 42, a total of one-hundred-forty webs could be provided under controlled tension through the use of the fourteen tension sensing means 70, 71 provided in the seven hackstands 42. Unwind drive 43, Figure 1, is connected by shafts 44 (and other members not shown) to each hackstand 42 and its upper and lower ply-bonding and slitting means 45 so that anvil rolls 80 and 81 are driven through manually adjustable variable ratio drives (not shown), and so that the unwind drive pulleys 85 are driven through variable ratio drive means (not shown) which are responsive to the associated tension sensing means 70 or 71. The manually adjustable variable ratio drives enable adjusting all of the ply-bonding and slitting means 45 so that they synchronously meter all of the sheets 60a, 60b therethrough. Then, each unwind drive pulley 85 is independently coupled to unwind drive 43 through its own associated tension-responsive variable drive means to enable unwinding, under the control of controller 54, all of the parent rolls simultaneously under uniform tension. Thus, the machine speed is the peripheral velocity of the anvil £: rolls 80, 81 which speed is controlled through the use of con- ?/ troller 54, control cables 54a, and unwind drive 43, whereas the rate of unwinding each parent roll is independently controlled :; through the use of the tension sensing means and the tension- :|i 15 responsive variable speed drive means to achieve uniform machine-direction tension in all the sheets 60a, 60b being f> unwound. Each tension-responsive variable speed drive (not p. shown) responds, briefly, to low tension (downward displacement -; of its associated dancer roll 79) by slowing the peripheral '- 20 velocity of the parent roll to increase tension, and each ; variable speed drive responds to high tension (upward displace¬ ment of its associated dancer roll 79) by increasing the :; peripheral velocity of the parent roll to decrease tension. .? As will be described more fully hereinafter, the >.;25 webs are synchronously forwarded from the ply-bonding and ;; slitting means 45 by draw means 53. ' : As briefly referred to hereinbefore, the exemplary preferred embodiment interfolding apparatus 40, Figure 1, comprises seven hackstands 42 disposed in a semi-circular '.3(5 array. Six of the seven hackstands 42 have whole upper and lower parent rolls 61a and 61b installed therein whereas the seventh hackstand has partial (not full width) parent rolls installed therein. Each of the twelve whole or full parent rolls thus provided is converted by its associated slitting means 45 into ten webs 62 and each of the two partial parent rolls is converted into three webs 62 for a total of one-hundred-twenty-six webs. The preferred embodiment apparatus 40 is sized and configured to interfold webs of two-ply facial tissue which are eight-and-one-quarter inches wide. Therefore/ each whole parent roll is eighty-two-and- one-half inches wide and the partial parent rolls are twenty- four-and-three-fourths inches wide. Alternatively, the parent rolls can be wider and the apparatus can further comprise edge trimming means (not shown) for the purpose of enabling each parent roll to provide a discrete number of webs of uniform width W, Figure 4. Referring now to Figures 3, 4 and 4a, the pre-arc rollers 46 are disposed at graduated, descending elevations (from left to right) above the arcuate guide 47 so that the adjacent webs provided by adjacent hackstands can be justaposed in half-overlapped relation. Figure 4, in the same manner that the webs supplied by each hackstand are disposed in 20. half-overlapped relation. Figures 4a and 18. Thus, by virture of axially offsetting upper parent rolls 61a, Figure 1, one-half web width from the lower parent rolls 61b, and by positioning the pre-arc rollers 46 at graduated elevations, all of the webs (one-hundred-twenty-six in number in the exemplary preferred embodiment apparatus) are juxtaposed in half-overlapped relation prior to being looped under the arcuate guide 47. For clarity in Figure 3, the upper sheets 60a and .; the lower sheets 60b are not shown to be slit into- discrete webs 62a and 62b respectively as they normally are. Such unslit sheets would exist, principally on start-up, while the .•:; 5 slitting means 45 are disabled. Also for clarity, referring to Figures 4, 4a and 18, the discrete upper webs 62a and the discrete lower webs 62b are alternatively designated super¬ jacent webs 62a and subjacent webs 62b respectively. £*' Arcuate guide 47, Figures 1 and 6, of the preferred ...: 10 embodiment apparatus 40 has a uniform radius RG and its center !?/. of curvature is disposed at point F, Figure 15, adjacent the |c guide rollers 51, 52 as will be further described in conjunction ft with Figure 15. ?v The arcuate guide 47 is cantilevered from the frame .15 41 hY a Plurality of strut assemblies 100, as exemplified in Figure 5, through the use of shims 101 and bolts 102 so that the elevation of the arcuate guide can be adjusted. if. As further shown in Figure 5, the arcuate guide 47 is |: segmented by virtue of comprising a plurality of arcuate- |,.20 shape core rods 103, flexible cylindrical sleeves 104, juncture means 105 for coupling adjacent core rods 103 together, and means not shown for rotatably securing the flexible sleeves 104 on the core rods 103. Thus constructed, the arcuate guide 47 comprises a plurality of freely rotatable arcuate sections and, but for the junctures 105, is an arcuate- shape idler roller. The segments of the arcuate guide 47 are rotated by the array of webs being turned thereabout as the webs are drawn from the pre-arc rollers 46 to the folding table 48, Figures 2 and 3. 16- In the exemplary preferred apparatus 40, the outside radius RG, Figure 6, of the arcuate guide 4 7 is one-hundred- eighty-nine inches so that the width of a web W, eight-and-one- quarter inches. Figure 4, spans an arcuate length of about two- and-one-half degrees, angle Theta, of the arcuate guide. Thus, the arcuate guide 47 causes the webs which are guided thereonto in side-by-side, half-overlapped relation to nominally converge towards point F, Figure 6. However, the exact convergent relation¬ ship is determined by the alignment of the elongate guides 49 with respect to the arcuate guide 47 and with respect to the guide rollers 51, 52 as further described hereinafter. The folding table 48, Figure 1, comprises a portion of frame 41, a set of elongate guides 49 which set numbers seventy-one in the preferred embodiment interfolder, and adjust¬ able means exemplified by the attachment 110, Figure 7, for individually securing the guides 49 to the frame 41. The attachments exemplified by 110 enable adjusting the position of each guide 49 radially as well as circumferentially so that each elongate guide can be independently aligned. - Each elongate guide 49, Figures 6 through 11 inclusive, has an inverted V-shape cross section, an apex ridge 64, outboard end 115, inboard end 116, sides 121, 122 having uniform widths chamfered nose 123, a shelf 124, an overhang 125, and side edges 128, 129. Each elongate guide 49, Figures 6 through 11 inclusive, comprises a molded shell 49a, and a foamed plastic core 49b. It has a length L between its outboard end 115 and its side edges 128, 129 are, in the plan view of Figure 6, straight lines which have an angle Theta therebetween. The side edges 128, 129 would, if extended radially inwardly, • intersect at the point F spaced a distance S from inboard end 116. Furthermore, if extended radially outwardly, the side edges 128, 129 would be spaced an arc length W apart at a radius rg from point F; W being the width of a web 62 to be V-folded over the elongate guide, and RG being the outside radius of the arcuate guide 47. Furthermore, as also viewed in the plan view. Figure 6, the ridge 64 of the elongate guide 49 bisects angle Theta. As stated hereinbefore, angle Theta is about two- and-one-half degrees in the preferred embodiment apparatus. By designing the ridge 64 and the side edges 128, 129 to be straight lines, in the plan view, and the fact that, as previously stated, the sides 121, 122 are designed to be of fied by H in Figure 8) of the sides of any transverse section X-X, Figure 6, is a non-linear function with respect to the distance (Delta L + S) of the section X-X from F. This non-linear relationship causes the ridge 64 and the side edges 128, 129 to be arcuate-shape as indicated in the foreshortened side elevational view. Figure 7. Indeed ridges 64 and the side edges 128, 129 are symmetrically curved above and below respectively, in the side elevational view, the neutral axis 130 of the elongate guide 49 as indicated in Figure 7. Preferably, all of the neutral axes extend substantially horizontally and are in an imaginary plane which is also tangent to the bottom of the arcuate guide 47, Figure 7. Referring again to Figures S -through 11 inclusive which are transverse sectional views of an elongate guide 49, the profiles of sides 121 and 122 in each sectional view are straight lines but for slightly rounding the ridge 64. Referring still to Figures 8 through 11 inclusive, the shelves 124 and the overhangs 125 of elongate guides 49 enable adjusting the center-to-center distances of guides 49 when they are secured and aligned in side-by-side relation to form the folding table 48, Figure 1, without having an open space between adjacent guides. That is, the shelf 124 of each elongate" guide is configured to fit underneath the overhang 125 of an adjacent elongate guide as shown in Figures 12-14 inclusive. The need for such interfitting of adjacent guide portions is, briefly, to avoid open spaces intermediate adjacent elongate guides 49 in order to obviate the possibility of having portions of webs extend lower than the side edges 128, 129 of the elongate guides as webs are drawn across the folding table 48. Referring now to Figure 16, turning guide means comprises a pair of guide rollers 51, 52 which are rotatably mounted on shafts 141, 142, means 143 for universally tilting the shafts 141, 142, and means not shown for positioning the shafts 141, 142 so that the centers 146, 147 of rotation of the guide rollers 51, 52 are in predetermined spaced relations with respect to F, the center of curvature of the arcuate guide 47, and with respect to the longitudinal centerline 58 of the Interfolding apparatus 40, Figure 1. X Figure 15 is a fragmentary, somewhat schematie plan |:. view of the central portion of the interfolding apparatus |; showing the spatial relationships between the apex ridges 64 «>f e elongate guides 49 of the folding table 48, the guide rollers 51, 52, the center-of-curvature F of the arcuate guide 47 and the longitudinal centerline 58 of the apparatus 40. The space T, Figure 15, between guide rollers 51, I.. 52 is the nominal uncompressed thickness of the endless bundle £.;.; 59 of interfolded webs being drawn therebetween. The centers |:10 KS, 147 of guide rollers 51 and 52 respectively are spaced distances E and G respectively downstream from F, the center 'P of curvature of the arcuate guide 47. The guide rollers 51, 52 have equal diameters D. In the preferred embodiment apparatus, D is about twelve inches, E is about three-and-twelve-one- ::.:': 15 hundredths inches, and G is about two-and-six-one-hundredths inches, |: , J-Referring back to the elongate gviides 49, they are secured to the frame 41, Figure 1, in a fan-shape array with "~~ their radially outwardly disposed ends, outboard ends 115, spaced radially inwardly from the arcuate guide 47, and with their radially inwardly disposed ends, inboard ends 116, spaced from point F, the center of curvature of the arcuate guide 47, and from guide rollers 51, 52 as shown in Figure 15. While being secured to frame 41, the arcuate guides are individually aligned and spaced as described below. ;iVi20 All of the elongate guides 49 are individually aligned so that their ridges 64 are aligned with the longitudinal hinge lines of the superjacent tissues 62a (Figure 4) where they come under the arcuate guide 47, Figure 2, and so that each ridge 64 is aimed at an imaginary point of tangency to accumulated folded tissues being drawn past the guide rollers 51, 52. That is, line 151, Figure 15, is aligned with the valley or trough between the first and second elongate guides (numbered) clockwise from left to ifight) and is tangent to guide roller 51 at point T-. The medial line or hinge line of the first subjacent web 62b follows this line 151 and is the first web directed about the periphery of guide roller 51. In a similar manner, lines 152, 153 are the hinge lines of the superjacent webs 62a having their hinge lines aligned with the ridges 64 of the seventeenth and thirty-second elongate guides respectively and show that webs drawn thereacross are directed tangentially, at points T32 and T63 respectively, onto the accumulated webs being drawn past guide roller 51. Also in a similar manner, lines 154, 155 are the hinge lines of superjacent webs 62a having their hinge lines aligned with the ridges 64 of the forty-eighth and the sixty-fourth elongate guides 49 respectively and show that webs drawn thereacross are directed tangentially, at points T94 and T-je respectively, onto the accumulated webs being drawn past guide roller 52. kis .25 As a group, the inboard ends 116 of all the elongate guides 49 are so disposed that they define a serpentine-shape line 118, Figure 15. Line 118, Figure 15, is established as follows. Referring back to Figure 6, the sides 121, 122 of each elongate guide 49 would converge at a point spaced a distance S radially inwardly from the inboard end 116 of the guide. In the preferred embodiment apparatus 40, the inboard end 116 of each elongate guide 49 is spaced this distance S from its respective point of-tangency; Tlf T32f for example. In the exemplary apparatus, S is twenty-two inches. In an alternate embodiment apparatus (not shown) each elongate guide is designed so that, as a group, their outboard ends can be uniformly spaced from the arcuate guide, and so that the side edges of each individual elongate guide would, in the plan view, if extended radially inwardly, converge at its associated point of tangency with respect to the guide rollers or the accumulated webs being drawn thereabout. This alternate embodiment apparatus may further comprise an arcuate guide of non-uniform radius wherein each arcuate portion associated with an elongate guide has a nominal center-of-curvature disposed at the respective point-of-tangency of its associated elongate guide. As previously stated, as each subjacent web 62b, Figures 12-14 inclusive, is drawn radially inwardly across the folding table 48, its longitudinally extending medial line or hinge line 67b tracks along the bottom of a trough 65 and the side edges of the web track along two adjacent ridges 64 whereby the subjacent web is V-folded upwardly in the trough 65. Concurrently, as each superjacent web 62a is drawn radially inwardly across the folding table 48, its longitudinally extending medial line or hinge line 67a, Figures 12 and 13, tracks along the ridge 64 of an elongate guide 49 and the side edges of the web track along the side edges 128, 129 of the same elongate guide 49 whereby the superjacent web is V-folded downwardly over an elongate guide 49. In this manner, each web is V-folded so that each of its folds (halves) that was disposed in overlapping relation with a fold of another web. Figure 4, becomes sandwiched between two folds of the other web. In conjunction with this description, it is believed to be important that, while the superjacent webs 62a are V-folded downwardly over machine members (elongate guides 49), the sub¬ jacent webs 62b are not folded over or about machine members. Rather, the subjacent webs 62b are folded about one fold each of two adjacent superjacent webs 62a. As described above, the hinge line of the first subjacent web (numbered clockwise in Figures 1 and 15) is aligned with the trough between the first and second elongate guides and the first web is V-folded upwardly in that trough. Then, proceeding clockwise around the array of elongate guides, odd numbered webs (subjacent webs 62b) are V-folded upwardly in other troughs and the even numbered webs (superjacent webs 62a) are V-folded downwardly over the elongate guides. Thus, web number one-hundred-twenty-six, in the preferred embodi- ment apparatus is a superjacent web 62a whose longitudinal centerline follows the ridge of elongate guide number sixty- four. Moreover, by virtue of the neutral axes being disposed in an imaginary plane which is tangent to the bottom edge portion of the arcuate guide 47 as stated here¬ inbefore, as each web travels radially inwardly from the arcuate guide 47 and across the folding table 48, the medial centerline of each fold of each web remains in the imaginary plane and each fold is rotated in a spiral manner about its medial centerline to effect the folding of the webs. As stated hereinbefore, the folding table 48 of the exemplary preferred embodiment apparatus comprises a set of " seventy-one elongate guides and only one-hundred-twenty-six webs are drawn across only sixty-four of the elongate guides, the array of one-hundred-twenty-six webs is asymmetrically disposed with respect to the longitudinal centerline of the apparatus. It is this asymmetrical relationship that pre¬ cipitates the asymmetrical relationship (described hereinbefore) of the guide rollers 51, 52 with respect to point F. That is, the"guide rollers 51, 52 are positioned to essentially be disposed symmetrically with respect to the centerline of the array of webs being drawn between them. The centerline of the array of Wl webs is' for a11 intents and purposes, line 153, Figure 15. I! * Were the array of webs symmetrical with respect to the & centerline 58 of the interfolder 40, Figure 1, the axes of ... guide rollers 51, 52 would be symmetrically disposed about • 25 centerline 58 and equally spaced from point F. As also stated hereinbefore, guide rollers 51, 52 have, in the preferred embodiment apparatus, approximately twelve inch diametçrs D, and are spaced one-and-one-half lnches aPart; distance T. Thus, the ratio between the guide roller diameters D and the spacing T (the uncompressed bundle height) between the guide rollers is about eight-to-one. It ; has been found that- substantially cmaller ratios precipitate an undesirable level of buckling and wrinkling of tissues adjacent the peripheries of the guide rollers. Furthermore, substantially larger diameter guide rollers precipitate an undesirably large deviation in the spacing of the inboard - ends of the elongate guides from point F when the guides are individually aligned with points-of-tangency as described hereinbefore. Further with respect to the freely'rotatable guide rollers 51, 52, Figure 15, it is believed that the fact that the webs are not compressed therebetween enables air trapped between the folds of the webs to escape as the webs converge towards the guide rollers 51, 52, and during the period of time the endless bundle 59 of webs is drawn towards and compressed by the draw means 53. This prolonged period for the escape of trapped air is believed to be a substantial improvement over prior art interfolding apparatuses wherein webs are converged towards and compressed directly between driven guide rollers or belts. The means 14 3, Figure 16, for tilting the shafts 141, 142 of the guide rollers 51, 52 provide means for causing the webs to track the ridges 64 and troughs 65 of the folding table 4 8 and for maintaining square corners on the endless bundle 59 of webs being drawn between the guide rollers, That is, by independently tilting the axes of the guide rollers 51, 52 more or less, the webs being drawn thereacross can be made to ride at the same elevations about the guide rollers whereby the endless bundle is assured of having square corners. That is, the cross-sectional shape of the endless bundle can be maintained rectangular whereas the cross-section might otherwise be a parallogram-shape without right angle corners. The draw means 53, Figures 16 and 17, comprises a variable speed drive motor 160, two oppositely disposed belt conveyors 161, 162, and means not shown for the motor to synchronously drive the conveyors. Each conveyor. Figure 16, comprises two end rolls 165, 166, a plurality of idler rolls 167, and an endless belt 168. The end rolls and the idler rolls are rotatably secured to upper chassis plates 169 and to lower chassis plates (not shown) so that the facing portions of the belts 168 which contact the webs are substantially planar. The conveyors 161, 162 of the draw means 53 are mounted on a horizontally extending surface 170 by pivotally attaching the downstream end of conveyor 162 tô the surface by a vertically extending pivot pin 171. The conveyors are further provided with rollers 172 so that they will be free to align themselves with an endless bundle of webs drawn therebetween. The oppositely disposed downstream ends of the conveyors are biased towards each other by the aiir cylinder 163 and the upstream ends are biased towards each other by another air cylinder (not shown). The degree of biasing is controllable by pressure regulating means not shown and, during the operation of the apparatus is adjusted to enable the draw belts to draw the endless bundle 59 of interfolded v/ebs therebetween. Furthermore/ the degree cx£ biasing of the upstream ends is substantially less than the downstream ends so that the endless bundle is gradually compressed as it negotiates the run between the belts. The variable speed drive motor 160 is drivingly connected to the conveyors by means (not shown) to synchro¬ nously drive the conveyors. The speed of motor 160 is controlled by controller 54, Figure 1, via a control cable 54a so that the draw means 53 supplies the traction required to synchronously pull all of the webs all of the way from the plybonder rolls 80, and so that a predetermined elongation of the webs occurs intermediate the plybonder rolls 80 and the draw means 53. By virtue of the webs being somewhat elastic the predetermined elongation imparted by the draw means causes sufficient tension to be maintained in the webs in the machine direction to obviate slack webs intermediate the plybonder rolls and the draw means. Obviating slack "webs provides adequate control of the webs to cause them to be interfolded as they are drawn across the folding table 48. In another embodiment of the apparatus (not shown), similar to interfolder 40, for interfolding substantially inelastic material, tension control means are provided inter¬ mediate the plybonder rolls and the draw means to maintain sufficient machine-direction tension in the webs to obviate slack webs. " To prepare for operation of apparatus 40, Figures 1 and 2, whole and partial parent rolls 61a, 61b are installed in the hackstands 42. Then, sufficient lengths of the unslit sheets 60a, 60b are unwound from each parent roll to be looped as shown in Figure 2 about the rolls, through the ply-bonding 1054173 . and slitting means 45, over the pre-arc rollers 46, cLoncd and under the arcuate guide 47, across the folding table 48, and thence between the guide rollers 51, 52 and through the draw means 53. During the threading, the plybonder wheels 80a are spaced from the plybonder anvil rolls 80, and the slitter knives 81a are spaced from the slitter anvil rolls 81. After being threaded, the plybonder wheels 80a are moved into co¬ operating relation with their respective anvil rolls 80. Then, the drive 43 and the draw means 53 are started under the control of the controller 54 whereby unslit sheets are unwound and drawn through the apparatus. Upon being drawn therethrough, the sheets will be caused to conform to the ridges 64 and troughs 65 of the folding table 48 by virtue of the bottom edge of the arcuate guide 47 being disposed at about or slightly below the elevation of the neutral axes of the elongate guides 49, Figure 7, and by sufficiently adjusting the tilt of the guide rollers 51, 52 with means 143. When the sheets have thus begun to track the ridges 64 and troughs 6 5 of the folding table 48, the slitter knives 81a are moved into cooperating relation with their respective anvil rolls 81 whereupon the slitting of the sheets into webs begins. The medial lines of the superjacent webs 62a then track the ridges 64 of the elongate guides 49, and the medial lines of the sub¬ jacent webs 62b track along the bottoms of the troughs 65 whereupon the subjacent webs 62b are progressively V-folded upwardly in the troughs 65, Figures 12-14 inclusive, and the superjacent webs 62a are progressively V-folded downwardly over the ridges 641 In this manner, each overlapped fold or half of each web is sandwiched between the two folds or halves of the adjacent web as stated hereinbefore. •y. i 10 rate. ss* S>; The controller 54 acts, in conjunction with the tension control means 70, 71, to simultaneously unwind all the parent rolls under uniform, nominal predetermined tension up to the nips intermediate the plybonder anvil rolls 80 and the plybonder wheels 80a, and controls draw means 53 so that a predetermined elongation is imparted to each web inter¬ mediate the plybonder nips and the draw means 53 so that, ultimately, the apparatus issues an endless bundle 59, Figures 2 and 15, of interfolded webs at a controlled '"""* An alternate configuration of guide rollers is shown in Figure 20, to comprise guide rollers 51a, 52a. In this configuration the axes 146a, 147a of the guide rollers 51a, 51b are symmetrically disposed with respect to the centerline 58 of the apparatus and are equally spaced downstream from point F, the center of curvature of the arcuate guide. However, the radius of guide roller 52a is Delta-R greater than the radius R of guide roller 51a. Delta-R is equal to the composite thickness of the number N of webs required to make the number of webs disposed to the right of centerline 58 equal to the number of webs disposed to the left of centerline 58 of the apparatus. When the preferred embodiment apparatus which could interfold a symmetrical array of one-hundred-forty webs is used as described hereinbefore to interfold an asymmetrical array of one-hundred-twenty-six webs, the number N is fourteen and Delta-R is about one-hundred-sixty-seven thousandths of an inch. Still referring to Figure 20, the centerline 190 of the asymmetrical array of one-hundred-twenty-six webs and the centerline 191 of the endless bundle 59 are displaced from the centerline 58 of the apparatus with seventy webs disposed leftward and fifty-six webs disposed rightward from the centerline 58 of the apparatus. As indicated by lines 192-196 inclusive, the webs are tangentially led onto the guide rollers 51a, 52a and the previously accumulated webs being drawn there¬ about at points of tangency in the manner previously described herein with respect to the preferred embodiment apparatus. Radial lines R, R15, R32' R63 anâ R70 inâicate the respective distances from axis 146a of the points of tangency for the first, fifteenth, thirty-second, sixty-third, and seventieth webs respectively, and radial lines R-j R9 4' an< R126 inkiest® the respective distances from axis 147a of the points of tangency for the seventy-first, ninety-fourth, and one-hundred-twenty-sixth webs respectively. Figures 21 and 22 show, respectively, a number of alternate webs 262 in one-third-overlapped shingled relation, and a bundle 263 of webs 262 formed by 8-interfolding the shingled webs. Such a bundle of S-folded webs having a width of one-and- one-half W can be formed by an alternate embodiment interfolding apparatus, not shown, comprising the arcuate guide 47, the folding table 48, turning guide means 50, and draw means 53 which are all shown and described herein. This alternate embodiment apparatus further comprises means (not shown) for forwarding to the arcuate guide, an array of webs in the one- third-overlapped shingled relation shown in Figure 21. The folds of these webs would alternately be folded upwardly in the troughs 65 and downwardly over the ridges 6 4 of the folding table 48 so that each overlapped fold of each web is sandwiched between two folds of the adjacent web to ultimately enable pop-up dispensing. CTther alternate embodiments of interfolding apparatus comprising the same arcuate guide 47, folding table 48, and turning guide means 50 as the preferred embodiment inter- foldr 40, Figures 1 and 2, can be provided to interfold W'.DS comprising more than tV7o folds. Figure 18, or three folds. Figure 21. For webs comprising two edge folds and an even number of intermediate folds, the webs would have to be arrayed so that their edge folds were in alternate overlapped relation as shown in Figure 19. The configuration shown in Figure 19 is the species of this generic class wherein the number of intermediate folds is the even number zero. For webs comprising two edge folds and an odd number of . intermediate folds, the webs would have to be arrayed so that their edge folds were in the overlapped-shingled relation as shown in Figure 21. The configuration shown in Figure 21 is the species of this generic class wherein the number of intermediate folds is the odd number one.
