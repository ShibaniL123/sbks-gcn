CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/991,926, filed May 12, 2014. BACKGROUND Skateboarders, BMX riders, aggressive inline skaters, snowboarders, skiers, and scooter riders all use stationary obstacles to perform tricks on. Each of these sports includes certain tricks called grinds. A grind refers to sliding a board, bicycle, etc. across a section of the stationary obstacle. Typically, stationary obstacles will include a railing, ledge, or other slick surface from which to grind. Rails can come in different sizes and shapes. Large flat surfaces on which grinds are performed on sides of the stationary obstacles are referred to as ledges or boxes. Skateboarders require a smooth, large area to be able to ride effectively. Parking lots and sidewalks provide the necessary consistency for most riders. Since skateboarders are often limited by their location, there may be very few places to ride and/or set up obstacles. As such, a transformable obstacle providing a wide range of challenges is needed. Such a transformable obstacle can help a rider progress since more options are available, and the rider will not grow tired of continuously riding a single obstacle.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Embodiments of the present invention include a transformable obstacle assembly for use by extreme sport athletes. Typically, the transformable obstacle assembly can include a dual rail structure and a pair of support structures. The dual rail structure can include, but is not limited to, a first rail, a second rail, a plurality of ribs, a first panel, and a second panel. The pair of support structures can each include a T-shaped frame and a sleeve. The sleeve can include a pair of flanges located near an upper portion of the sleeve to engage with the dual rail structure. The plurality of ribs can be implemented to connect the first rail to the second rail. Generally, the first rail and the second rail can be connected in parallel. In one embodiment, the plurality of ribs can be steel tubes directly coupled to the first rail and to the second rail via ends of the steel tubes. Typically, the first panel and the second panel can be made from a rigid material having a slick surface. For instance, the first panel and the second panel can be made from polyvinyl chloride. It is to be appreciated that other rigid materials having slick surfaces can be implemented without exceeding a scope of the present invention. The first panel and the second panel can be implemented to offer different trick options for extreme sports athletes. For instance, an athlete may ride or execute a manual (e.g., a trick in which one or more wheel(s) are balanced off the ground while riding) along a center of one of the panels without grinding the rails. Typically, grinds can pose different challenges for riders depending on geometric characteristics of the grind surface. In one embodiment, the first rail and the second rail can have different shapes. For instance, the first rail can have a tubular structure and the second rail can have a rectangular tube structure. In another instance, the first rail and the second rail can have the same shape. It is to be appreciated that the first rail and the second rail can have a variety of shapes and sizes. Generally, the first rail and the second rail can be the same length. Embodiments of the present invention include a dual rail structure having curved rails. Typically, the curved dual rail structure can be implemented similar to the previously described dual rail structure. In one embodiment, the plurality of ribs can be coupled to a convex side of a first rail and a concave side of a second rail. In another embodiment, the plurality of ribs can be coupled to side's located approximately 90 degrees from the convex or concave sides of the rails. Embodiments of the present invention further include a transformable obstacle assembly including a quad rail structure. Typically, the quad rail structure can have a square or rectangular cross-section. Support structures similar to the previously described support structures can be implemented to elevate the quad rail structure.

Typically, the transformable obstacle assembly 100 can include a dual rail structure 102, a first support structure 104, and a second support structure 106, as shown in FIGS. 1A-1B. The support structures 104, 106 can be implemented to elevate the dual rail structure 102. In some embodiments, the support structures 104, 106 can be adjustable in height. As shown in FIGS. 3A-3D, the dual rail structure 102 can be adapted to be coupled to the support structures 104, 106 in a horizontal orientation and in a vertical orientation. The dual rail structure 102 can typically include a first rail 110, a second rail 112, a plurality of ribs 114, a first panel 116, and a second panel 118. Referring to FIGS. 2A-2B, detailed diagrams of the transformable obstacle assembly 100 without the first panel 116 and the second panel 118 are shown. The plurality of ribs 114 can be implemented to couple the first rail 110 to the second rail 112, as shown in FIGS. 2A-2B. Generally, the first rail 110 and the second rail 112 can be coupled in parallel. In one embodiment, the plurality of ribs 114 can be steel rectangular tubes directly coupled to the first rail 110 and to the second rail 112 via ends of the steel rectangular tubes. In another embodiment, the plurality of ribs 114 can be steel tubes. It is to be appreciated that the plurality of ribs 114 can be manufactured from a variety of rigid materials. For instance, the plurality of ribs 114 can be manufactured from aluminum. In one embodiment, the plurality of ribs 114 can include a combination of tubes and bars.

It is to be further appreciated that the plurality of ribs 114 can generally be a structural member including, but not limited to, a bar, a tube, and a rod comprised of a rigid material adapted to connect the first rail 110 to the second rail 112. A first side 120 and a second side 122 can be formed when the rails 110, 112 are coupled to the plurality of ribs 114, as shown in FIGS. 2A-2B. In a typical embodiment, the first panel 116 and the second panel 118 can be coupled to different sides of the plurality of ribs 114 between the first rail 110 and the second rail 112, as shown generally in FIGS. 1A-3D. Generally, the first panel 116 can be coupled to the first side 120 of the plurality of ribs 114 and the second panel 118 can be coupled to the second side 122 of the plurality of ribs 114. In one embodiment, the panels 116, 118 can be sized to fit between the first rail 110 and the second rail 112. In one embodiment, the dual rail structure 102 can include only one of the panels 116, 118. For instance, as shown in FIG. 2A or 2B, the dual rail structure 102 can be implemented with only one of the panels 116, 118 secured to the plurality of ribs 114. Typically, the first panel 116 and the second panel 118 can be manufactured from a rigid material having a slick surface. For instance, the first panel 116 and the second panel 118 can be manufactured from polyvinyl chloride. It is to be appreciated that other rigid materials having slick surfaces can be implemented without exceeding a scope of the present invention. For example, the first panel 116 and the second panel 118 can be manufactured from steel. In some embodiments, the first panel 116 can be manufactured from a different material than the second panel 118. By implementing varying materials, a user can practice tricks on different surfaces. For instance, the first panel 116 may be a rigid material having a slick surface and the second panel 118 may be a rigid material have a coarse surface. In one embodiment, the first rail 110 and the second rail 112 can have different shapes. For instance, the first rail 110 can have a tubular structure and the second rail 112 can have a rectangular tube structure. In another instance, the first rail 110 and the second rail 112 can have the same shape. It is to be appreciated that the first rail 110 and the second rail 112 can have a variety of shapes and sizes. Generally, the first rail 110 and the second rail 112 can have substantially the same length. Referring to FIGS. 3A-3D, detailed diagrams of an exploded view of the obstacle assembly 100 in a horizontal orientation and a vertical orientation are illustrated. FIGS. 3A-3B show the obstacle assembly 100 in a horizontal orientation and FIGS. 3C-3D shown the obstacle assembly 100 in a vertical orientation. As shown, the dual rail structure 102 can be rotated from the horizontal orientation to the vertical orientation, and vice versa. Depending on a preference of a user, the first rail 110 and the second rail 112 can be located in one of four different locations. Namely, the first rail 110 and the second rail 112 can be in either a top position or a bottom position when the dual rail structure 102 is in the vertical orientation. Further, the first rail 110 and the second rail 112 can be in either a first position or a second position when the dual rail structure 102 is in the horizontal orientation.

Typically, the plurality of ribs 114 can be evenly spaced along a length of the rails 110, 112. As shown, the steel rectangular tubes can be welded perpendicular to the first rail 110 and the second rail 112. It is to be appreciated that the number of steel rectangular tubes and the distance between each tube can be based on a length of the first rail 110 and the second rail 112. It is to be appreciated further that the steel rectangular tubes can be coupled to the first rail 110 and the second rail 112 by a variety of means without exceeding a scope of the present invention. In a typical implementation, the ribs 114 located proximate ends of the dual rail structure 102 can include one or more holes 124 adapted to receive a rod 126. The rod 126 can be adapted to insert into one of the holes 124 to couple the dual rail structure 102 to one of the support structures 104, 106. In one embodiment, the rod 126 can be a threaded bolt adapted to threadably couple to the ribs 114 located proximate ends of the dual rail structure 102. For instance, the holes 124 can be threaded and adapted to receive the threaded bolt 126. In another instance, a nut can be implemented in combination with the threaded bolt 126 to couple the support structures 102, 106 to one of the end ribs. As shown generally in FIGS. 1A-3D, a rib located at a proximal end of the dual rail structure 102 can include three holes 124. Generally, the pair of ribs located proximate opposite ends of dual rail structure 102 can include the same number of holes. It is to be appreciated that more or less holes may be included with the ribs located proximate ends of the dual rail structure 102. In FIG. 3A, the obstacle assembly 100 is shown with the dual rail structure 100 in a horizontal orientation with the first rail 110 in a distal position and the second rail 112 in a proximal position. In FIG. 3B, the obstacle assembly 100 is shown with the dual rail structure 100 in a horizontal orientation with the second rail 112 in a distal position and the first rail 110 in a proximal position. In FIG. 3C, the obstacle assembly 100 is shown with the dual rail structure 102 in a vertical orientation with the first rail 110 on top. Assuming the obstacle rail assembly 100 was in a position similar to the one shown in either FIG. 3A or 3B, the dual rail structure 102 would have been rotated 90 degrees and the sleeves 132 on each of the support structures 104, 106 would have been rotated to engage the dual rail structure 102 in the vertical orientation. In FIG. 3D, the dual rail structure 102 is in a vertical orientation with the second rail 112 on top. Referring to FIGS. 4A-4B and 5, detailed diagrams of one of the support structures 104, 106 are illustrated. FIGS. 4A-4B include detailed diagrams of one example of how the support structures 104, 106 interface with the dual rail structure 102. FIG. 4A illustrates one example of how the dual rail structure 102, in a horizontal orientation, interfaces with one of the support structures 104, 106. FIG. 4B illustrates one example of how the dual rail structure 102, in a vertical orientation, interfaces with the support structures 104, 106. FIG. 5 includes an exploded view of one of the support structures 104, 106. As shown, the support structures 104, 106 can be implemented to elevate and stabilize the dual rail structure 102 above a surface. Typically, the first support structure 104 and the second support structure 106 can be identical. In one embodiment, the support structures 104, 106 can each include a T-shaped frame 130 and a sleeve 132. The sleeve 132 can be adapted to slidably engage the T-shaped frame 130. For instance, the sleeve 132 can be a tube having an inner diameter slightly bigger than an outer diameter of the T-shaped frame 130. As such, the T-shaped frame 130 can slide in and out of the sleeve 132. Generally, the sleeve 132 can be adapted to be removably engaged to the T-shaped frame 130 such that the sleeve 132 can be removed, rotated, and then engaged back to the T-shaped frame 130. In a typical implementation, the first support structure 104 and the second support structure 106 can be coupled to opposite ends of the dual rail structure 102 via the pair of rods 126. Referring to FIG. 5, an exploded view of one of the support structures 104, 106 is illustrated. As shown, the T-shaped frames 130 can generally include a substantially vertical portion 136 and a substantially horizontal portion 138. As shown, the substantially vertical portion 136 can interface with the sleeve 132 and the substantially horizontal portion 138 can interface with the ground or other surface. In one embodiment, the vertical portion 136 can include a plurality of holes 140. The sleeve 132 can include one or more holes 142. The sleeve holes 142 can be located proximate an upper and a lower portion of the sleeve 132, as shown in FIG. 5. The upper hole can be implemented to couple the sleeve 132 to the dual rail structure 102 and the lower hole can be implemented to couple the sleeve 132 to the vertical portion 136. It is to be appreciated that the number of holes on the vertical portion 136 and the sleeve 132 can be increased or decreased without exceeding a scope of the present invention. As shown generally in FIGS. 4A-5, the vertical portion holes 140 and the sleeve holes 142 can be adapted to line up to one another. Typically, a fastening mechanism 144 can be implemented to pass through one of the vertical portion holes 140 and a corresponding sleeve hole 142 to couple the sleeve 132 to the T-shaped frame 130. It is to be appreciated that the fastening mechanism 144 can include, but is not limited to, a threaded rod, a rod, a clevis pin, etc. As such, the sleeve 132 can be moved along a length of the vertical portion 136 to elevate or lower the sleeve 132 and be coupled to the vertical portion 136. Referring back to FIGS. 4A-4B, one side of the sleeve 132 can be adapted to interface with the dual rail structure 102 when in a horizontal orientation and an opposite side of the sleeve 132 can be adapted to interface with the dual rail structure 102 when in a vertical orientation. To interface with the dual rail structure 102 in a horizontal orientation, the sleeve 132 can typically include a horizontal flange 150 that extends out from the sleeve 132 to engage a bottom surface of a rib of the dual rail structure 102. To interface with the dual rail structure 102 in a vertical orientation, the sleeve 132 can include a pair of flanges 152 that extend out from sides of the sleeve 132 and engage sides of a rib of the dual rail structure 102. In one embodiment, a friction pad 154 can be implemented on an interior of each of the pair of flanges 152. The friction pads 154 can be implemented to secure the dual rail structure 102 to the support structure 104. It is to be appreciated that the flanges 150, 152 on the sleeve 132 can be implemented to keep the dual rail structure 102 from rotating. Further shown in FIGS. 4A-4B is the pair of rods 126 that can be implemented to couple the support structures 104, 106 to the dual rail structure 102. Generally, each of the rods 126 can be passed through a sleeve hole 142 located above the sleeve flanges 150, 152 and then inserted into one of the holes 124 of an end rib of the dual rail structure 102. Referring to FIGS. 6A-6B, detailed diagrams of the transformable obstacle assembly 100 in various positions is illustrated. FIG. 6A shows the obstacle assembly 100 being in an elevated position by sliding the sleeve 132 up the vertical portion 136 and securing the sleeve 132 to an upper portion of the vertical portion 136. As shown, each of the sleeves 132 of the first support structure 104 and the second support structure 106 are at the same height. In FIG. 6B, the sleeves 132 on each of the support structures 104, 106 are at different heights giving the obstacle assembly 100 a slope.
