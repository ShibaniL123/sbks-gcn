step 2 Methyl 6-vinylnicotinate (491 mg, 2.97 mmol) obtained above was dissolved in a 50% methanol aqueous solution (8 mL). Lithium hydroxide monohydrate (276 mg, 6.57 mmol) was added thereto and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. The mixture was cooled to 0Â°C, then 3 mol/L hydrochloric acid (3 mL) was added, and the precipitated solid was collected by filtration to give 6-vinylnicotinic acid (309 mg, 70%) as a white solid.
