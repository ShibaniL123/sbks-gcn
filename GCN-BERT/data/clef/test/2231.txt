This is a national stage of PCT/GB05/002653 filed Jul. 6, 2005 and published in English. The invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing botulinum neurotoxin. The presently most used botulinum neurotoxin is botulinum neurotoxin type A. This neurotoxin is produced during fermentation in the presence of Clostridium botulinum strains. Botulinum neurotoxin type A complexes (which include botulinum neurotoxin type A and at least another non-toxic protein) are active principles widely used in modern medicine. An example of a pharmaceutical composition based on such a complex is the product Dysport® currently sold by the company of the Applicants. Among the most common medical indications for which a botulinum neurotoxin type A complex could be used, one could mention the treatment of a number of muscle disorders (e.g. blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, torticollis, spasticity, tension headache, back pain or wrinkles), as well as other disorders such as migraine. Alternatively, high purity botulinum toxin (i.e. botulinum neurotoxin free from its complexing non-toxic proteins) may replace the corresponding botulinum toxin complex as disclosed in PCT applications WO 96/11699 or WO 97/35604. Currently, the marketed botulinum neurotoxin compositions contain human serum albumin. However, some concerns have been expressed about albumin (see e.g. in PCT application WO 01/58472). For this reason, the pharmaceutical industry is now considering to find alternative stabilising agents to albumin by other stabilising agents in pharmaceutical compositions. A possible solution is disclosed in PCT patent application WO 01/58472. In this document, albumin is replaced by a polysaccharide, i.e. a polymer of more than two saccharide molecule monomers, which plays the role of the stabiliser in the botulinum neurotoxin composition. An alternative solution is the one described in PCT patent application WO 97/35604 or U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,512,547 and 5,756,468. In these documents, it is disclosed that pure botulinum neurotoxin (i.e. botulinum neurotoxin free from its complexing non-toxic proteins) can be stabilised by trehalose. The Applicant has unexpectedly discovered that a surfactant possesses sufficient stabilising effects to replace albumin, the polysaccharide of PCT patent application WO 01/58472 or the trehalose of PCT patent application WO 97/35604 in botulinum neurotoxin compositions. The invention therefore pertains to the use of a surfactant for stabilising a solid or liquid pharmaceutical composition that contains as active principle a botulinum toxin. By botulinum toxin should be understood a naturally occurring botulinum toxin or any recombinantly produced botulinum toxin. By naturally occurring botulinum toxin should be understood either a high purity botulinum neurotoxin derived from Clostridium spp or a botulinum neurotoxin complex derived from Clostridium spp. By high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) is meant, in the present application, botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) outside from complexes including at least another protein. In other words, a high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) does not contain significant quantities of any other Clostridium spp derived protein than botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G). Preferably, according to the present invention, botulinum neurotoxin complexes and high purity botulinum neurotoxins will be selected from the group consisting of botulinum neurotoxin complex and high purity botulinum neurotoxin of type A, botulinum neurotoxin complex and high purity botulinum neurotoxin of type B and botulinum neurotoxin complex and high purity botulinum neurotoxin of type F. More preferably, botulinum neurotoxin complexes and high purity botulinum neurotoxins will be selected from the group consisting of botulinum neurotoxin complex and high purity botulinum neurotoxin of type A and botulinum neurotoxin complex and high purity botulinum neurotoxin of type F. More particularly, botulinum neurotoxin complexes and high purity botulinum neurotoxins will be botulinum neurotoxin complexes and high purity botulinum neurotoxins of type A. By type A botulinum neurotoxin should be understood any botulinum toxin of type A, and notably botulinum neurotoxins of type A1, A2 or A3. The same applies mutatis mutandis to the other serotypes of toxins. The high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) used according to the invention or contained in the above described pharmaceutical compositions can easily be obtained from the corresponding botulinum neurotoxin complex, for example as explained in Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology (1995), 195, p. 151-154. High purity Clostridium botulinum toxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) is obtained, for example, by purification of an adequate fermentation medium (for example, an enriched meat media broth containing Clostridium Botulinum and left for fermentation—this broth may be, for example, the one described in Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology (1995), 195, p. 150 and DasGupta, “Microbial food toxicants. Clostridium botulinum toxins. CRC handbook of foodborne diseases of biological origin”, CRC Boca Raton, p. 25-56). When including high purity botulinum neurotoxin in a composition according to the instant invention, the purity degree of the toxin should preferably be higher than 80%, more preferably higher than 90 or 95% and in a more particularly preferred manner higher than 98% or 99%. It can be assessed, for example, by using the purity assay described in the present application. The instant invention also relates to a solid or liquid pharmaceutical composition comprising: (a) a botulinum toxin, and(b) a surfactant. According to a particular variant of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition will be a solid pharmaceutical composition and will essentially consist of: (a) a botulinum toxin, and(b) a surfactant. According to another particular variant of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition will be a liquid pharmaceutical composition and will essentially consist of: (a) a botulinum toxin,(b) a surfactant, and(c) water. In the abovementioned pharmaceutical compositions, the surfactant will be such that it stabilises the botulinum toxin. A solid pharmaceutical composition according to the invention can be obtained for example by lyophilising a sterile water solution containing the components (a) and (b) as mentioned previously. A liquid pharmaceutical composition according to the invention will be obtained by mixing the solid (e.g. lyophilised) mixture of components (a) and (b) with sterile water. According to the invention, the concentrations of said components (a) and (b) in the solution to be lyophilised or the liquid pharmaceutical composition will preferably be as follows: the solution will contain from 50 to 10,000 LD50 units of botulinum neurotoxin complex (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) or high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) per ml of solution, preferably [the solution will contain] from 50 to 3,000 LD50 units of botulinum neurotoxin complex (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) or high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) per ml of solution, more preferably from 100 to 2,500 LD50 units of botulinum neurotoxin complex (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) or high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) per ml of solution and most preferably from 100 to 2,000 LD50 units of botulinum neurotoxin complex (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) or high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) per ml of solution; the concentration of surfactant will be from above critical micellar concentration to a concentration of 1% v/v, and notably from about 0.005% to 0.02% v/v in the case of polysorbate 80. Preferably, the surfactant will be a non-ionic surfactant. Non-ionic surfactants include notably polysorbates and block copolymers like poloxamers (i.e. copolymers of polyethylene and propylene glycol). According to a preferred variant of the invention, the surfactant will be a polysorbate. More preferably, a polysorbate included in a composition according to the instant invention will have a mean polymerisation degree of from 20 to 100 monomer units (preferably about 80), and may for example be polysorbate 80. Preferably also, the polysorbate should be vegetable-derived. According to a preferred execution mode of the invention, the solid or liquid pharmaceutical composition will also contain a crystalline agent. By crystalline agent is meant an agent which, inter alia, would maintain a mechanically strong cake structure to lyophilised botulinum neurotoxin complex (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) or high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G). When included in solid formulations, crystalline agents also have a bulking effect. Crystalline agents notably include sodium chloride. Contrarily to what was taught in the prior art (see e.g. Goodnough, M. C. and Johnson, E. A., Applied and Environmental Microbiology (1992), 58(10), 3426-3428), the use of sodium chloride for this type of compositions further improves the stability of the botulinum toxin composition. According to yet another preferred execution mode of the invention, the solid or liquid pharmaceutical composition will also contain a buffer to maintain pH from 5.5 to 7.5. The buffer can be any buffer able to maintain the adequate pH. Preferably, the buffer for compositions according to the invention will be chosen from the group consisting of succinate and an amino acid like histidine. In particular, the buffer will be histidine. Preferably, the pH will be at least equal to 5.5 or 5.8, and most preferably at least equal to 6.0 or 6.5. Preferably also, the pH will be equal to or less than 7.5 or 7.0, more preferably equal to or less than 6.8. Preferably, the solid or liquid pharmaceutical composition of the invention may also contain a disaccharide. The disaccharide used in compositions according to the invention will preferably be chosen from the group consisting of sucrose, trehalose, mannitol and lactose. The disaccharide used in compositions according to the invention will more preferably be chosen from the group consisting of sucrose and trehalose. In particular, the disaccharide used in compositions according to the invention will be sucrose. Preferably, the disaccharide will be present in the pharmaceutical compositions of the instant invention, particularly when the compositions are in a solid form. The instant invention therefore notably relates to a solid or liquid pharmaceutical composition comprising: (a) botulinum neurotoxin complex (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) or high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G),(b) a surfactant,(c) a crystalline agent,(d) a buffer to maintain pH between 5.5 to 7.5. Preferably, a disaccharide will also be included in the pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, especially when they are in a solid form. According to this variant of the invention, a solid pharmaceutical composition can be obtained by lyophilising a sterile water solution containing the components (a) to (d) as mentioned previously. A liquid pharmaceutical composition according to the invention will be obtained by mixing a solid (e.g. lyophilized) mixture of said components (a) to (d) with sterile water. According to the invention, the concentrations of said components (a) to (d) in the solution to be lyophilised or the liquid pharmaceutical composition will preferably be as follows: the solution will contain from 50 to 10,000 LD50 units of botulinum neurotoxin complex (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) or high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) per ml of solution, preferably [the solution will contain] from 50 to 3,000 LD50 units of botulinum neurotoxin complex (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) or high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) per ml of solution, more preferably from 100 to 2,500 LD50 units of botulinum neurotoxin complex (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) or high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) per ml of solution and most preferably from 100 to 2,000 LD50 units of botulinum neurotoxin complex (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) or high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) per ml of solution; the concentration of surfactant will be from above critical micellar concentration to a concentration of 1% v/v, and notably from about 0.005% to 0.02% v/v in the case of polysorbate 80; the concentration of crystalline agent will be from 0.1 to 0.5 M, more preferably from 0.1 to 0.4 M, notably about 0.15 to 0.3 M; and the concentration of buffer will be from 1 to 50 mM, more preferably from 5 to 20 mM, notably about 10 mM. As mentioned earlier, the solid or liquid pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention may contain a disaccharide. In that case, the concentration of disaccharide in the solution to be lyophilised/the liquid pharmaceutical composition will be for example from 5 to 50 mM, preferably from 5 to 25 mM, more preferably from 10 to 20 mM, and notably about 11.7 mM. According to a preferred execution mode of the invention, the mixture of the different components of the pharmaceutical composition (i.e. botulinum neurotoxin complex (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) or high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G), the surfactant and the optional excipients such as the crystalline agent, the buffer or the disaccharide) is lyophilised. The solid compositions thus obtained, which are also part of this invention, should preferably be stable for at least 12 months, more preferably for at least 18 months and in a more particularly preferred manner for at least 24 or even 36 months. A composition according to the invention is considered stable during a certain period of time if at least 70% of the initial toxicity, as evaluated by assessing the LD50 in mice or by any method validated with respect to the LD50 mouse assay (i.e. a method allowing a conversion of its results into LD50 units), is maintained over said period of time (cf. the part entitled “mouse toxicity assay” concerning the LD50 mouse assay).

The dose of botulinum neurotoxin complex (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) or high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) which shall be needed for the treatment of the diseases/disorders mentioned above varies depending on the disease/disorder to be treated, administration mode, age and body weight of the patient to be treated and health state of the latter, and it is the treating physician or veterinary that will eventually make the decision. Such a quantity determined by the treating physician or veterinary is called here “therapeutically efficient quantity”. For botulinum neurotoxin complex (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) or high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G), this therapeutically efficient dose is often expressed as a function of the corresponding LD50.

The term “about” refers to an interval around the considered value. As used in this patent application, “about X” means an interval from X minus 10% of X to X plus 10% of X, and preferably an interval from X minus 5% of X to X plus 5% of X. Unless they are defined differently, all the technical and scientific terms used here have the same meaning as that usually understood by an ordinary specialist in the field to which this invention belongs. Similarly, all publications, patent applications, all patents and all other references mentioned here are incorporated by way of reference. The following examples are presented by way of illustration and should in no way be considered to limit the scope of the invention.

Stored in these conditions, it is stable for at least six months at 23 to 27° C. and at least twelve months at 2-8° C. Analytical Methods Mouse Toxicity Assay A mouse toxicity assay can be used to measure the toxicity of botulinum neurotoxin complex (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G) or high purity botulinum neurotoxin (type A, B, C, D, E, F or G). In the assay, a standard diluent will be used to prepare a range of dilutions at or about the estimated LD50 value. The range and scale of dilutions is arranged so as to establish an accurate LD50 value. Mice are injected intraperitoneally with a known and standardised volume of diluted toxin. After 96 hours, the number of deaths and survivors in each dilution group will be recorded. The LD50 value is the median dose which kills half of the injected animals within 96 hours. A composition according to the invention is considered stable over a certain period of time if at least 70% of the initial toxicity is maintained over said period of time relative to a reference preparation. 1.
