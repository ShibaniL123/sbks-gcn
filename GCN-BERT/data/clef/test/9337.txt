CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/940,598, filed Nov. 5, 2010, which claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/258,432, filed Nov. 5, 2009, both incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The conformation of the non-collagenous (NC1) domain of the α3 chain of the basement membrane collagen IV [α3(IV)NC1] depends in part on phosphorylation. Goodpasture Antigen Binding Protein (GPBP) (WO 00/50607; WO 02/061430) is a non-conventional protein kinase that catalyzes the conformational isomerization of the α3(IV)NC1 domain during its supramolecular assembly, resulting in the production and stabilization of multiple α3(IV)NC1 conformers in basement membranes. Increased expression levels of GPBP have been associated with the production of aberrant non-tolerized α3(IV)NC1 conformers, which conduct the autoimmune response mediating Goodpasture (“GP”) syndrome. In GP patients, autoantibodies against the α3(IV)NC1 domain (“Goodpasture antigen” or “GP antigen”) cause a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and often lung hemorrhage, the two cardinal clinical manifestations of the GP syndrome. Furthermore, it has been proposed that GPBP regulates inflammation, apoptosis and protein folding, and that increased GPBP expression induces antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis (IgA nephropathy, systemic lupus erythematosus and Goodpastute autoimmune syndrome) and resistance of cancer cells to a number of chemotherapeutic agents including those (i.e. paclitaxel) inducing protein misfolding-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress Thus, inhibitors of GPBP are useful for the treatment of antibody-mediated disorders, drug-resistant cancer, inflammation, protein misfolding and ER stress-mediated disorders, and aberrant apoptosis.

The compounds of this first and second aspect of the invention have been identified as novel GPBP inhibitors.

No. 7,326,768, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). The compounds of the present invention are peptidomimetics of the core of the self-interaction site of Q2 (SHCIE), and are shown herein to possess GPBP inhibitory activity, making them useful as therapeutics in antibody-mediated disorders, drug-resistant cancer, inflammation, protein misfolding and ER stress-mediated disorders, and aberrant apoptosis. The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of this first or second aspect of the invention and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, solvent, adjuvant or diluent. The compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be provided in a kit with instructions for using the compound or composition. In a third aspect, the present invention provides methods for treating antibody-mediated disorders, drug-resistant cancer, inflammation, protein misfolding and ER stress-mediated disorders, and aberrant apoptosis comprising administering one or more compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention to a subject in need thereof.

When the bicyclic heteroaryl is a monocyclic heteroaryl fused to a benzo ring, then the bicyclic heteroaryl group is connected to the parent molecular moiety through any carbon atom or nitrogen atom within the bicyclic ring system. Representative examples of bicyclic heteroaryl include, but are not limited to, benzimidazolyl, benzofuranyl, benzothienyl, benzoxadiazolyl, benzoxathiadiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, cinnolinyl, 5,6-dihydroquinolin-2-yl, 5,6-dihydroisoquinolin-1-yl, furopyridinyl, indazolyl, indolyl, isoquinolinyl, naphthyridinyl, quinolinyl, purinyl, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolin-2-yl, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolin-3-yl, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolin-4-yl, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl, thienopyridinyl, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazolyl, and 6,7-dihydrobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazol-4(5H)-onyl. In certain embodiments, the fused bicyclic heteroaryl is a 5 or 6 membered monocyclic heteroaryl ring fused to either a phenyl ring, a 5 or 6 membered monocyclic cycloalkyl, a 5 or 6 membered monocyclic cycloalkenyl, a 5 or 6 membered monocyclic heterocyclyl, or a 5 or 6 membered monocyclic heteroaryl, wherein the fused cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocyclyl groups are optionally substituted with one or two groups which are independently oxo or thia. “Pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problems or complications commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio or which have otherwise been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as being acceptable for use in humans or domestic animals.

EXAMPLES Synthesis of Q2 Peptidomimetics New terphenyl compounds capable of mimicking the peptide Q2 (SEQ ID NO:2) (U.S. Pat. No. 7,326,768) and modulating the kinase activity of GPBP are synthesized. Scheme 1 shows the terphenyl peptidomimetic proposed: every phenyl ring of this scaffold contains a different group that mimics the following amino acids: a) alanine, serine and glutamic acid in the case of compound 1. b) serine, glutamic acid and valine in the case of compound 2. The synthetic strategy lies in a modular synthesis of 3,2′,2″-tris-substituted-terphenyl derivatives by means of palladium catalysed cross coupling reactions between the different phenyl synthons (bromoaryls, aryltriflates, boronates and boronic acids). Synthesis In order to diversify and modify the solubility/lipophilicity of the terphenyl scaffold 1, the changes in the phenyl ring that mimics the alanine residue are introduced: a nitrogen atom and a trifluoromethyl group increase the family of terphenyl 1 derivates (Scheme 2). The first step of this synthesis consisted of the regioselective bromination of commercial 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde in accordance with a known procedure. The resulting bromoaryl 3 reacted with several different commercial boronic acids or boronates to afford biphenyls 4 (Scheme 3). In turn, phenols 4 were transformed into triflates 5 with triflic anhydride and pyridine as reagents. Triflates 5 reacted with boronate 6 under Suzuki coupling conditions to give terphenyls 7 (Scheme 4). Boronate 6 was previously synthesized from 2-bromo-5-hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 (Scheme 5). Catalytic hydrogenation of terphenyl intermediates 7 reduced the double bound, cleaved the benzyl group and also reduced the carbonyl group to methyl group to give compounds 11. Basic hydrolysis of ethyl esters provided final terphenylic compounds 12 (Scheme 6). Basic hydrolysis of esters 13 provided the terphenyl 1 compounds (Scheme 7). Direct fluorination of the hydroxyl group of terphenyls 13 was carried out to afford the derivates 14. Basic hydrolysis of the ethyl esters 14 gave the final fluorinated terphenyls 15 (Scheme 8). Direct fluorination of the aldehyde group of terphenyls 7 was only achieved in compound 7c, so fluorination of the carbonyl group must be carried out with the biphenyls 4a,b. Difluorinated terphenyls 18a,b were obtained. After catalytic hydrogenation, basic hydrolysis of ethyl esters 19 gave the final difluorinated terphenyls 20 (Scheme 9). Alkyl side chain modifications were performed in the phenolic position of the terphenyl molecules to increase the family of compounds without changes in the terphenyl residues (Scheme 10). Iodination of commercial 3-(3-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid, followed by the Miyaura boronation reaction afforded boronate 27 (Scheme 11). Boronate 27 was coupled with triflate 5c to afford the terphenyl 28 with similar reaction conditions to those described above. After carbonyl reduction and basic hydrolysis of the ethyl ester, compound 22i was obtained (Scheme 12). Terphenyl 22k was obtained from compound 21i after hydroxyl group fluorination and basic hydrolysis of the ethyl ester (Scheme 13). Direct fluorination of terphenyl 28 was achieved to give the compound 22l (Scheme 14). Finally, two more terphenylic compounds (22j and 32) were prepared with the same methodology described above (Scheme 15). Synthesis of the Second Terphenylic Family After regioselective bromination of commercial 3-isopropylphenol, boronate 35 was obtained (Scheme 16). This boronate was coupled with triflate 37 to afford the new terphenyl derivate 38. Catalytic hydrogenation under high hydrogen pressure and Pd(OH)2 caused total reduction of the carbonyl group and served to synthesize another terphenylic compound that could mimic alanine, glutamic acid and valine residues (Scheme 17). Experimental Procedures General Method: The reactions were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere unless otherwise indicated. CH2Cl2 was distilled from calcium hydride prior to use.

Then, the solvent was removed in vacuo and the crude reaction product was suspended in water. The aqueous layer was extracted with AcOEt and filtered and the combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and removed in vacuo under reduced pressure. The resulting crude reaction product was purified by means of flash chromatography on silica gel.

Biological Activity of Q2 Peptidomimetics Example 92 Goodpasture antigen-binding protein (GPBP) is a non-conventional Ser/Thr kinase which targets and phosphorylates the non-collagenous (NC1) domain of α3 chain of human type IV collagen [α 3(IV)NC1], known as Goodpasture antigen. GPBP expression has been associated with antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis and drug-resistance cancer. We have reported that GPBP self-interacts, that aggregation and autophosphorylation regulate kinase activity, and that the Q2 peptide inhibits autophosphorylation and GPBP kinase activity (WO 00/50607). The GPBP kinase inhibitory activity of a number of terphenylic compounds mimicking Q2, a peptide representing a critical GPBP motif which is relevant for GPBP quaternary structure stabilization, have been tested on GPBP autophosphorylation ability The autophosphorylation ability of GPBP has been used to test the GPBP kinase inhibitor activity of several terphenylic compounds (Scheme 18) derived from the chemical structure of Q2 peptide, which in turn represents GPBP peptidic sequence relevant for self-interaction. Two hundred nanograms of yeast recombinant FLAG-GPBP were subjected to phosphorylation assays in absence (vehicle) or presence of a 10 μM concentration of each of the indicated Q2-peptidomimetic compounds or an intermediate of synthesis used as negative control (C), during 5 min at 30° C. Reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, Western blot and autoradiography. The bands in the autoradiography were quantified using Image-Quant TL software. The kinase activity of GPBP in the presence of the indicated compounds was referred to the sample containing the vehicle, which was given a value of 100. Table 1 shows the outcome of FLAG-GPBP auto-phosphorylation assays performed in presence or absence of the different Q2-peptidomimetics compounds represented in Scheme 18.
