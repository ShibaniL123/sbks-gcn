FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to orthopedic medicine and surgery. More particularly, the present invention relates to methods and apparatus for delivery and fixation of medical devices, such as for treating articulating joints. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The glenohumeral joint of the shoulder is found where the head of the humerus mates with a shallow depression in the scapula. This shallow depression is known as the glenoid fossa. Six muscles extend between the humerus and scapula and actuate the glenohumeral joint. These six muscles include the deltoid, the teres major, and the four rotator cuff muscles. As disclosed by Ball et al. in U.S. Patent Publication No. U.S. 2008/0188936 A1 and as illustrated in FIG. 1 the rotator cuff muscles are a complex of four muscles. These four muscles are the supraspinatus, the infraspinatus, the subscapularis, and the teres minor. The centering and stabilizing roles played by the rotator cuff muscles are critical to the proper function of the shoulder. The rotator cuff muscles provide a wide variety of moments to rotate the humerus and to oppose unwanted components of the deltoid and pectoralis muscle forces. The four muscles of the rotator cuff arise from the scapula 12. The distal tendons of the rotator cuff muscles splay out and interdigitate to form a common continuous insertion on the humerus 14. The subscapularis 16 arises from the anterior aspect of the scapula 12 and attaches over much of the lesser tuberosity of the humerous. The supraspinatus muscle 18 arises from the supraspinatus fossa of the posterior scapula, passes beneath the acromion and the acromioclavicular joint, and attaches to the superior aspect of the greater tuberosity 11. The infraspinatus muscle 13 arises from the infraspinous fossa of the posterior scapula and attaches to the posterolateral aspect of the greater tuberosity 11. The teres minor 15 arises from the lower lateral aspect of the scapula 12 and attaches to the lower aspect of the greater tuberosity 11. The mechanics of the rotator cuff muscles 10 are complex. The rotator cuff muscles 10 rotate the humerus 14 with respect to the scapula 12, compress the humeral head 17 into the glenoid fossa providing a critical stabilizing mechanism to the shoulder (known as concavity compression), and provide muscular balance. The supraspinatus and infraspinatus provide 45 percent of abduction and 90 percent of external rotation strength. The supraspinatus and deltoid muscles are equally responsible for producing torque about the shoulder joint in the functional planes of motion. The rotator cuff muscles 10 are critical elements of this shoulder muscle balance equation. The human shoulder has no fixed axis. In a specified position, activation of a muscle creates a unique set of rotational moments. For example, the anterior deltoid can exert moments in forward elevation, internal rotation, and cross-body movement. If forward elevation is to occur without rotation, the cross-body and internal rotation moments of this muscle must be neutralized by other muscles, such as the posterior deltoid and infraspinatus. The timing and magnitude of these balancing muscle effects must be precisely coordinated to avoid unwanted directions of humeral motion. Thus the simplified view of muscles as isolated motors, or as members of force couples must give way to an understanding that all shoulder muscles function together in a precisely coordinated way—opposing muscles canceling out undesired elements leaving only the net torque necessary to produce the desired action. Injury to any of these soft tissues can greatly inhibit ranges and types of motion of the arm. With its complexity, range of motion and extensive use, a fairly common soft tissue injury is damage to the rotator cuff or rotator cuff tendons. Damage to the rotator cuff is a potentially serious medical condition that may occur during hyperextension, from an acute traumatic tear or from overuse of the joint. With its critical role in abduction, rotational strength and torque production, the most common injury associated with the rotator cuff region is a strain or tear involving the supraspinatus tendon. A tear in the supraspinitus tendon 19 is schematically depicted in FIG. 2. A tear at the insertion site of the tendon with the humerus, may result in the detachment of the tendon from the bone. This detachment may be partial or full, depending upon the severity of the injury. Additionally, the strain or tear can occur within the tendon itself. Injuries to the supraspinatus tendon 19 and recognized modalities for treatment are defined by the type and degree of tear. The first type of tear is a full thickness tear as also depicted in FIG. 2, which as the term indicates is a tear that extends through the thickness of the supraspinatus tendon regardless of whether it is completely torn laterally. The second type of tear is a partial thickness tear which is further classified based on how much of the thickness is torn, whether it is greater or less than 50% of the thickness. The accepted treatment for a full thickness tear or a partial thickness tear greater than 50% includes reconnecting the torn tendon via sutures. For the partial thickness tears greater than 50%, the tear is completed to a full thickness tear by cutting the tendon prior to reconnection. In contrast to the treatment of a full thickness tear or a partial thickness tear of greater than 50%, the treatment for a partial thickness tear less than 50% usually involves physical cessation from use of the tendon, i.e., rest. Specific exercises can also be prescribed to strengthen and loosen the shoulder area. In many instances, the shoulder does not heal and the partial thickness tear can be the source of chronic pain and stiffness. Further, the pain and stiffness may cause restricted use of the limb which tends to result in further degeneration or atrophy in the shoulder. Surgical intervention may be required for a partial thickness tear of less than 50%, however, current treatment interventions do not include repair of the tendon, rather the surgical procedure is directed to arthroscopic removal of bone to relieve points of impingement or create a larger tunnel between the tendon and bone that is believed to be causing tendon damage. As part of the treatment, degenerated tendon may also be removed using a debridement procedure in which tendon material is ablated. Again, the tendon partial tear is not repaired. Several authors have reported satisfactory early post operative results from these procedures, but over time recurrent symptoms have been noted. In the event of recurrent symptoms, many times a patient will “live with the pain”. This may result in less use of the arm and shoulder which further causes degeneration of the tendon and may lead to more extensive damage. A tendon repair would then need to be done in a later procedure if the prescribed treatment for partial tear was unsuccessful in relieving pain and stiffness or over time the tear propagated through injury or degeneration to a full thickness tear or a partial thickness tear greater than 50% with attendant pain and debilitation. A subsequent later procedure would include the more drastic procedure of completing the tear to full thickness and suturing the ends of the tendon back together. This procedure requires extensive rehabilitation, has relatively high failure rates and subjects the patient who first presented and was treated with a partial thickness tear less than 50% to a second surgical procedure. As described above, adequate treatments do not currently exist for repairing a partial thickness tear of less than 50% in the supraspinatus tendon. Current procedures attempt to alleviate impingement or make room for movement of the tendon to prevent further damage and relieve discomfort but do not repair or strengthen the tendon. Use of the still damaged tendon can lead to further damage or injury. Prior damage may result in degeneration that requires a second more drastic procedure to repair the tendon. Further, if the prior procedure was only partially successful in relieving pain and discomfort, a response may be to use the shoulder less which leads to degeneration and increased likelihood of further injury along with the need for more drastic surgery. There is a large need for surgical techniques and systems to treat partial thickness tears of less than 50% and prevent future tendon damage by strengthening or repairing the native tendon having the partial thickness tear. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to aspects of the invention, implant delivery systems for delivering sheet-like implants are disclosed. In some embodiments, the implant delivery system includes a delivery shaft, an implant expander, a sheath, and a sheet-like implant. In these embodiments, the delivery shaft has a proximal end and a distal end. The implant expander is mounted to the distal end of the delivery shaft. The implant expander includes a central portion and a plurality of leg portions radiating from the central portion. The implant expander is evertable between an unstressed configuration in which a distal surface of the implant expander defines a concave surface, and a first compact configuration in which the distal surface of the implant expander defines a convex surface. The implant expander has a first lateral extent when the implant expander is free to assume the unstressed configuration. The sheath defines a lumen having a lumen diameter. At least a portion of the delivery shaft is slidably disposed in the lumen. The lumen diameter is smaller than the first lateral extent of the implant expander so that the sheath holds the implant expander in the first compact configuration when slidably disposed therein. The sheet-like implant overlays at least a portion of the distal surface of the implant expander with portions of the sheet-like implant extending between the leg portions of the implant expander and the sheath. In some embodiments, a free end of each leg portion of the implant expander is disposed distally of the central portion when the implant expander is assuming the unstressed configuration. The free end of each leg portion is disposed proximally of the central portion when the implant expander is assuming the first compact configuration. The delivery shaft distal end may be fixed to the central portion of the implant expander to urge relative movement between the implant expander and the sheath such that the implant expander and the sheet-like implant can be advanced through a distal opening defined by the sheath so the implant expander is free to assume a deployed configuration. In some embodiments, a projection extends distally from the distal surface of the central portion of the implant expander to hold the position of delivery system when the projection is held against a target tissue. The implant expander may generally conform to the surface of a target tissue when the implant expander assumes the deployed configuration. In some embodiments, the distal surface of the implant expander defines a concave surface when the implant expander is assuming the deployed configuration and the target tissue has a generally convex shape. A free end of each leg portion may be disposed distally of the central portion when the implant expander is assuming the deployed configuration and the target tissue has a generally convex shape. In some embodiments, the implant expander causes the sheet-like implant to conform to the surface of a target tissue when the implant expander assumes the deployed configuration. In some embodiments, the implant expander assumes a second compact configuration when the implant expander is retracted proximally into the lumen of the sheath after having assumed the deployed configuration. The distal surface of the implant expander may define a concave surface when the implant expander is assuming the second compact configuration. In some embodiments, the free end of each leg portion is disposed distally of the central portion when the implant expander is assuming the second compact configuration. In some embodiments, the implant expander is integrally formed of a single material. The sheet-like implant may define a plurality of pockets. Each pocket may be dimensioned to receive a distal portion of a leg portion of the implant expander. In some of these embodiments, the sheet-like implant can be selectively separated from the implant expander by withdrawing the distal portions of the legs from the pockets. In some embodiments, the implant expander further includes a plurality of retainers to engage the sheet-like implant such that the sheet-like implant moves when the implant expander is moved. In some of these embodiments, the sheet-like implant can be selectively separated from the implant expander by withdrawing the retainers from the sheet-like implant. According to aspects of the present invention, methods of treating a rotator cuff of a shoulder are disclosed. In some embodiments, the method includes the steps of providing an implant delivery system, inflating the shoulder to create a cavity therein, placing the sheet-like implant and the implant expander inside the cavity, allowing the implant expander to assume a deployed configuration, attaching the sheet-like implant to the tendon, urging the implant expander to assume a second compact configuration, and removing the implant expander from the cavity. In these embodiments, the implant delivery system that is provided includes an implant expander. The implant expander has a central portion and a plurality of leg portions radiating from the central portion. The implant expander is evertable between an unstressed configuration in which a distal surface of the implant expander defines a concave surface, and a first compact configuration in which the distal surface of the implant expander defines a convex surface. A sheet-like implant overlays at least a portion of the distal surface of the implant expander. A sheath is disposed about the sheet-like implant and the implant expander. The sheath holds the implant expander in the first compact configuration. When the sheet-like implant and the implant expander are placed inside the cavity, a tendon is contacted with at least a portion of the implant while the implant expander is assuming the first compact configuration. When allowing the implant expander to assume a deployed configuration, the implant expander urges the sheet-like implant against a surface of the tendon. When urging the implant expander to assume a second compact configuration, the distal surface of the implant expander defines a concave surface. In some embodiments, the implant expander includes a projection extending distally from its central portion. The projection holds the position of the delivery system relative to the tendon when the sheet-like implant and implant expander are placed in the cavity against the tendon. In some embodiments, the step of allowing the implant expander to assume the deployed configuration includes urging relative movement between the implant expander and the sheath such that the implant expander and the sheet-like implant are advanced through a distal opening defined by the sheath. With this arrangement, the implant expander is free to assume the deployed configuration. In some embodiments, urging relative movement between the implant expander and the sheath includes withdrawing the sheath in a proximal direction relative to the implant expander. In some embodiments, urging relative movement between the implant expander and the sheath includes advancing the implant expander in a distal direction along the lumen of the sheath. In some embodiments, urging the implant expander to assume the second compact configuration includes advancing the sheath over the implant expander so that the implant expander is disposed inside the lumen defined by the sheath. In some embodiments, urging the implant expander to assume the second compact configuration includes drawing the implant expander proximally into the lumen defined by the sheath. In some embodiments, urging the implant expander to assume the second compact configuration includes drawing the implant expander and the projection that extends distally from the central portion of the implant expander proximally into the lumen defined by the sheath. According to aspects of the invention, methods of preparing a delivery system are disclosed. In some embodiments, these methods include the steps of providing a delivery sheath and an implant expander, covering at least a portion of the distal surface with a sheet-like implant, and deflecting the implant expander. The sheath defines a lumen having a lumen diameter. The implant expander includes a central portion and a plurality of leg portions radiating from the central portion. The implant expander is evertable between an unstressed configuration in which a distal surface of the implant expander defines a concave surface, and a first compact configuration in which the distal surface of the implant expander defines a convex surface. The implant expander has a first lateral extent when the implant expander is free to assume the unstressed configuration. The first lateral extent is greater than the lumen diameter of the sheath. When the implant expander is deflected, the implant expander assumes the first compact configuration and the implant expander and the sheet-like implant are placed in the lumen defined by the sheath. The sheath holds the implant expander in the first compact configuration with portions of the sheet-like implant being interposed between the leg portions of the implant expander and an inner surface of the sheath. Further aspects of the present invention will become apparent upon review of the Detailed Description with reference to the following drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following detailed description should be read with reference to the drawings in which similar elements in different drawings are numbered the same. The drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, depict illustrative embodiments and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. FIG. 3 is a stylized anterior view of a patient 20. For purposes of illustration, a shoulder 22 of patient 20 is shown in cross-section in FIG. 3. Shoulder 22 includes a humerus 14 and a scapula 12. In FIG. 3, a head 24 of humerus 14 can be seen mating with a glenoid fossa of scapula 12 at a glenohumeral joint. With reference to FIG. 3, it will be appreciated that the glenoid fossa comprises a shallow depression in scapula 12. The movement of humerus 14 relative to scapula 12 is controlled by a number of muscles including: the deltoid, the supraspinatus, the infraspinatus, the subscapularis, and the teres minor. For purposes of illustration, only the supraspinatus 26 is shown in FIG. 3. With reference to FIG. 3, it will be appreciated that a distal tendon 28 of the supraspinatus 26 meets humerus 14 at an insertion point. Scapula 12 of shoulder 22 includes an acromium 32. In FIG. 3, a subacromial bursa 34 is shown extending between acromium 32 of scapula 12 and head 24 of humerus 14. In FIG. 3, subacromial bursa 34 is shown overlaying supraspinatus 26. Subacromial bursa 34 is one of the hundreds of bursae found the human body. Each bursa comprises a fluid filled sac. The presence of these bursae in the body reduces friction between bodily tissues. Injury and/or infection of the bursa can cause it to become inflamed. This condition is sometimes referred to as bursitis. The exemplary methods and apparatus described herein may be used to fix tendon repair implants to various target tissues. For example, a tendon repair implant may be fixed to one or more tendons associated with an articulating joint, such as the glenohumeral joint. The tendons to be treated may be torn, partially torn, have internal micro-tears, be untorn, and/or be thinned due to age, injury or overuse. Applicants believe that the methods and apparatus of the present application and related devices may provide very beneficial therapeutic effect on a patient experiencing joint pain believed to be caused by partial thickness tears and/or internal microtears. By applying a tendon repair implant early before a full tear or other injury develops, the implant may cause the tendon to thicken and/or at least partially repair itself, thereby avoiding more extensive joint damage, pain, and the need for more extensive joint repair surgery. FIG. 4 is a stylized anterior view of a shoulder 22 including a humerus 14 and a scapula 12. In FIG. 4, a head 24 of humerus 14 is shown mating with a glenoid fossa of scapula 12 at a glenohumeral joint. A supraspinatus 26 is also shown in FIG. 4. This muscle, along with others, control the movement of humerus 14 relative to scapula 12. A distal tendon 28 of supraspinatus 26 meets humerus 14 at an insertion point 30. In the embodiment of FIG. 4, distal tendon 28 includes a first damaged portion 36. A number of loose tendon fibers 40 in first damaged portion 36 are visible in FIG. 4. First damaged portion 36 includes a first tear 42 extending partially through distal tendon 28. First tear 42 may therefore be referred to as a partial thickness tear. With reference to FIG. 4, it will be appreciated that first tear 42 begins on the side of distal tendon 28 facing the subacromial bursa (shown in the previous Figure) and ends midway through distal tendon 28. Accordingly, first tear 42 may be referred to as a bursal side tear. With reference to FIG. 4, it will be appreciated that distal tendon 28 includes a second damaged portion 38 located near insertion point 30. In the embodiment of FIG. 4, second damaged portion 38 of distal tendon 28 has become frayed and a number of loose tendon fibers 40 are visible in FIG. 4. Second damaged portion 38 of distal tendon 28 includes second tear 44. With reference to FIG. 4, it will be appreciated that second tear 44 begins on the side of distal tendon 28 facing the humerus 14. Accordingly, second damaged portion 38 may be referred to as an articular side tear. In the embodiment of FIG. 4, a sheet-like implant 50 has been placed over the bursal side of distal tendon 28. With reference to FIG. 4, it will be appreciated that sheet-like implant 50 extends over insertion point 30, first tear 42 and second tear 44. Some useful methods in accordance with this detailed description may include placing a tendon repair implant on the bursal side of a tendon regardless of whether the tears being treated are on the bursal side, articular side or within the tendon. In some cases the exact location and nature of the tears being treated may be unknown. A tendon repair implant may be applied to the bursal side of a tendon to treat shoulder pain that is most likely caused by one or more partial thickness tears in the tendon. In the embodiment of FIG. 4, sheet-like implant 50 is fixed to distal tendon 28 by a plurality of staples. FIG. 5 is a stylized perspective view illustrating an exemplary procedure for treating a shoulder 22 of a patient 20. The procedure illustrated in FIG. 5 may include, for example, fixing tendon repair implants to one or more tendons of shoulder 22. The tendons treated may be torn, partially torn, have internal micro-tears, be untorn, and/or be thinned due to age, injury or overuse. Shoulder 22 of FIG. 5 has been inflated to create a cavity therein. In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 5, a fluid supply 52 is pumping a continuous flow of saline into the cavity. This flow of saline exits the cavity via a fluid drain 54. A camera 56 provides images from inside the cavity. The images provided by camera 56 may be viewed on a display 58. Camera 56 may be used to visually inspect the tendons of shoulder 22 for damage. A tendon repair implant in accordance with this disclosure may be fixed to a bursal surface of the tendon regardless of whether there are visible signs of tendon damage. Applicants believe that the methods and apparatus of the present application and related devices may provide very beneficial therapeutic effect on a patient experiencing joint pain believed to be caused by internal microtears, but having no clear signs of tendon tears. By applying a tendon repair implant early before a full tear or other injury develops, the implant may cause the tendon to thicken and/or at least partially repair itself, thereby avoiding more extensive joint damage, pain, and the need for more extensive joint repair surgery. A delivery system 60 can be seen extending from shoulder 22 in FIG. 5. Delivery system 60 comprises a sheath that is fixed to a handle. The sheath defines a lumen and a distal opening fluidly communicating with the lumen. In the embodiment of FIG. 5, the distal opening of the sheath has been placed in fluid communication with the cavity created in shoulder 22. A tendon repair implant is at least partially disposed in the lumen defined by the sheath of delivery system 60. Delivery system 60 can be used to place the tendon repair implant inside shoulder 22. Delivery system 60 can also be used to hold the tendon repair implant against the tendon. In some embodiments, the tendon repair implant is folded into a compact configuration when inside the lumen of the sheath. When this is the case, delivery system 60 may be used to unfold the tendon repair implant into an expanded shape. The tendon repair implant may be fixed to the tendon while it is held against the tendon by delivery system 60. Various attachment elements may be used to fix the tendon repair implant to the tendon. Examples of attachment elements that may be suitable in some applications include sutures, tissue anchors, bone anchors, and staples. In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 5, the shaft of a fixation tool 70 is shown extending into shoulder 22. In one exemplary embodiment, fixation tool 70 is capable of fixing the tendon repair implant to the tendon with one or more staples while the tendon repair implant is held against the tendon by delivery system 60. FIG. 6 is an enlarged perspective view further illustrating the procedure shown in the previous Figure. FIG. 6 also illustrates the interior structure of shoulder 22 shown in the previous Figure. With reference to FIG. 6, it will be appreciated that shoulder 22 includes a humerus 14 and a scapula 12. In FIG. 6, a head 24 of humerus 14 is shown mating with a glenoid fossa of scapula 12 at a glenohumeral joint. A supraspinatus 26 is also shown in FIG. 6. A distal tendon 28 of supraspinatus 26 can be seen meeting a tuberosity of humerus 14 in FIG. 6. Delivery system 60 is also shown in FIG. 6. In the embodiment of FIG. 6, a distal end of delivery system 60 has been positioned near distal tendon 28 of supraspinatus 26. Delivery system 60 comprises a sheath 102 that is fixed to a handle 104. Sheath 102 defines a lumen 108 and a distal opening fluidly communicating with the lumen. In the embodiment of FIG. 6, a central portion of a sheet-like implant 50 can be seen extending through the distal opening defined by sheath 102. In the embodiment of FIG. 6, sheet-like implant 50 is overlaying an implant expander. The implant expander and sheet-like implant 50 are both assuming a compact configuration. The majority of sheet-like implant 50 is disposed inside sheath 102. A central portion of sheet-like implant 50 is extending out of sheath 102. This central portion of sheet-like implant 50 is contacting an outer surface of distal tendon 28 in the embodiment of FIG. 6. FIG. 7 is an enlarged perspective view showing delivery system 60 shown in the previous Figure. In the embodiment of FIG. 7, sheath 102 of delivery system 60 has been moved in a proximal direction P relative to handle 104. By comparing FIG. 7 to the previous Figure, it will be appreciated that sheet-like implant 50 and implant expander 120 are now disposed outside of lumen 108 defined by sheath 102. Implant expander 120 comprises a central portion 122 and a plurality of leg portions 124 radiating from central portion 122. In FIG. 7, leg portions 124 of implant expander 120 are shown overlaying sheet-like implant 50. Hub 126 is shown overlaying central portion 122 of implant expander 120 in FIG. 7. Implant expander 120 can be used to expand sheet-like implant 50 and hold sheet-like implant 50 against the surface of a target tissue. Sheet-like implant 50 may be fixed to the target tissue while the implant is held against the target tissue by implant expander 120. FIG. 8 is a stylized perspective view of a shoulder 22 including a supraspinatus 26 having a distal tendon 28. With reference to FIG. 8, it will be appreciated that a tendon repair implant 50 has been fixed to a surface of distal tendon 28. Tendon repair implant 50 may comprise, for example, various sheet-like structures without deviating from the spirit and scope of the present detailed description. In some useful embodiments, the sheet-like structure may comprise a plurality of fibers. The fibers may be interlinked with one another. When this is the case, the sheet-like structure may comprise a plurality of apertures comprising the interstitial spaces between fibers. Various processes may be used to interlink the fibers with one another. Examples of processes that may be suitable in some applications including weaving, knitting, and braiding. In some embodiment, the sheet-like structure may comprise a laminate including multiple layers of film with each layer of film defining a plurality of micro-machined or formed holes. The sheet-like structure of the tendon repair implant may also comprise a plurality of electro-spun nanofiber filaments forming a composite sheet. Additionally, the sheet-like structure may comprise a synthetic sponge material that defines a plurality of pores. The sheet-like structure may also comprise a reticulated foam material. Reticulated foam materials that may be suitable in some applications are available from Biomerix Corporation of Fremont, Calif. which identifies these materials using the trademark BIOMATERIAL™. The sheet-like structure may be circular, oval, oblong, square, rectangular, or other shape configured to suit the target anatomy. Various attachment elements may be used to fix tendon repair implant 50 to distal tendon 28 without deviating from the spirit and scope of this detailed description. Examples of attachment elements that may be suitable in some applications include sutures, tissue anchors, bone anchors, and staples. In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 8, a plurality of staples are fixing tendon repair implant 50 to distal tendon 28. In some exemplary methods, a plurality of staples may be applied using a fixation tool. The fixation tool may then be withdrawn from the body of the patient. Distal tendon 28 meets humerus 14 at an insertion point 30. With reference to FIG. 8, it will be appreciated that sheet-like implant 50 extends over insertion point 30. Tendon repair implant may be applied to distal tendon 28, for example, using the procedure illustrated in the previous Figure. In various embodiments, staples may straddle the perimeter edge of the sheet-like implant (as shown in FIG. 8), may be applied adjacent to the perimeter, and/or be applied to a central region of the implant. In some embodiments, the staples may be used to attach the implant to soft tissue and/or to bone. FIG. 9 is an additional perspective view further illustrating delivery system 60. Delivery system 60 comprises a sheath 102 that is fixed to a handle 104. Sheath 102 defines a lumen 108 and a distal opening 128 fluidly communicating with lumen 108. In the embodiment of FIG. 9, a delivery aid 130 can be seen extending through distal opening 128 defined by sheath 102. In the embodiment of FIG. 9, delivery aid 130 comprises a hub 126 that is disposed at the distal end of a control rod 132. An implant expander 120 is attached to hub 126.

Relative motion between locating guide 125 and tubular body 159 can be produced by rotating lever 165 relative to grip 163 when locating guide removal tool 127 is grasping the proximal portion of locating guide 125. This relative motion can be used to advance tubular body 159 over the barb 157 of locating guide 125. Locating guide 125 may be withdrawn from the body of the patient while tubular body 159 is covering barb 157. While exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, modifications may be made, and it is therefore intended in the appended claims and subsequently filed claims to cover all such changes and modifications which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. 1.
