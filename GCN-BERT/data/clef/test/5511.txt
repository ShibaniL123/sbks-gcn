BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The invention described herein generally relates to a disposable strap that can be used to extend items with a looped carrying feature such as shopping bags to be carried over the shoulder. 2. Description of the Related Art The need for a convenient solution to the problems of carrying items such as shopping bags, including plastic grocery bags and double-handled retail shopping bags, and heavy objects with handles, has been long recognized in the art. Plastic bags typically include a bag pouch or body which integrally extends to form a pair of handles defining a hand grip. Users may load the bag and securely grasp the bag through the handles, carrying anywhere from one to four bags with a single hand. However, the heavy weight of items or groceries in such bags causes the bag handles to collapse and take on the nature of thin ropes. The concentration of weight from the bag through the handles quickly fatigues the normal user, and provides pain and discomfort. Also, with heavy items, such as large cans or bottles, the handles are relatively thin bands which apply substantial force concentrated along narrow areas or regions of the hand, which can be painful when the cans or bottles are carried over for any period of time or distance. Although some shoppers bring reusable bags when they go shopping, and could in theory bring even larger bags or luggage, these solutions are typically inconvenient and require a degree of planning in which most people would not engage when going grocery shopping. Accordingly, a need exists for an apparatus for retaining bags that is not an inconvenience or unappealing and can be inexpensively manufactured, but which provides a secure comfortable transport. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an apparatus comprising a strap for facilitating carrying on a shoulder shopping bags or any other object with looped handle(s).

FIG. 1 presents an attachment facing view of an apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus comprises a strap 100 including adhesive tape construction on end portion 102 and end portion 104. The adhesive tape construction provides for attachment to any point along the central portion 106 of strap 100 to complete and secure a loop on each end of the strap when the end portions are folded over. Strap 100 may be used for carrying shopping bags or the like across a shoulder is made of a relatively thin elongated sheet or strip of pliable material which defines a longitudinal axis and which is flexible at least along its length direction or axis. The strap may be comprised of a disposable tape having a sheet material base of paper, synthetic sheet plastic material, cellophane, woven or matted fabric. The disposable tape may be, for example, approximately two to four feet long, and constructed of a strong paper based material such as duct tape or a paper stock material. In another embodiment, may comprise a disposal plasticized paper material. Adhesive tape construction may be applied in various lengths located at end portion 102 and end portion 104, generally the last inch or the last few inches on each end of strap 100. The adhesive tape construction may be utilized for closing, tying or binding purposes in connection with existing handles of carrying bags, such as shopping bags, or of various types of enclosures, cans, bottles, boxes, packages and the like. For example, the adhesive tape construction may include pressure-sensitive adhesive material on the end portions. The strap can provide shock and tear resistance and may be used for carrying relatively heavy bags, containers or articles. The pressure-sensitive adhesive may be covered with a removable facing comprising a sheet of material which may be readily removed in part or whole without difficulty from the pressure-sensitive adhesive facing. In some embodiments, a series of scoring or cut lines are provided with the removable facing such that portions of such facing may be removed to enable the pressure-sensitive adhesive to be applied to a handle of a bag or package with the uncovered, adhesive face portions. In alternative embodiments, the present invention provides for straps suitable for reusability as opposed to the disposable tape embodiments described above. Reusable straps may also be comprised of tape having a sheet material base of paper, synthetic sheet plastic material, cellophane, woven or matted fabric. Alternatively, reusable straps may be comprised of a strip of fabric such as cotton, nylon, or any other synthetic fabric, leather, or any combination thereof. The reusable straps may include reusable attachment construction such as hook and loop (e.g., Velcro), hooks, claws, clips or snaps on the end portions to close up around the handles of bags, etc. and secured to any length or a predetermined length of the central portion 106. Loops may be formed using the end portions 102 and 104 to secure objects on each respective end of strap 100 as illustrated in FIG. 2. A given end portion may be inserted and/or looped through one or more handles of shopping bags or any other object and closed up at any point along the length of central portion 106 of the strap to form a loop, allowing for any desirable length of the strap or loop size. Loops of various sizes or lengths of circumference may be created on each end, for example, loops ranging from approximately one inch to one foot in circumference, and may vary depending on the total length of the strap. Advantageously, the strap is provided with a flat surface suitable for use on the shoulder or a surface to conform to the shape of the shoulder to maximize comfort and loops that are configurable in size to accommodate a height of a user of the strap. FIG. 3 presents a manner in which the apparatus is used according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the illustrated embodiment, the strap 100 may be used to extend bag 300 and bag 320 to be carried over the shoulder 300 of a person. The strap is dimensioned and configured to rest on a human shoulder 300 and extend to each side thereof. Strap 100 may be configured to loop end portion 102 through bag handle 310 and end portion 104 through 330. For example, a method for carrying shopping bags across a shoulder may comprise inserting a first end portion of an elongated sheet of pliable material through a pair of handles of a first bag and forming a first loop around the pair of handles of the first bag by attaching the first end portion to a center portion of the elongated sheet of pliable material. The method further comprises inserting a second end portion of the elongated sheet of pliable material through a pair of handles of a second bag and forming a second loop around the pair of handles of the second bag by securing the second end portion to the center portion of the elongated sheet of pliable material. The first and second bags may then be transported by carrying the elongated sheet of pliable material over a human shoulder with the first and second bags secured on the first and second end portions of the elongated sheet pliable material. In particular, a midsection of the center portion may be rested on a human shoulder while transporting the first and second bags. In an alternative embodiment, the first end portion may be inserted through a pair of handles of a bag or several bags and forming a first loop around the pair of handles of the bag or bags by attaching the first end portion to a center portion of the elongated sheet of pliable material. The method further comprises inserting a second end portion of the elongated sheet of pliable material through the same pair or pairs of handles of the bag or bags and forming a second loop around the pair or pairs of handles of the bag or bags by securing the second end portion to the center portion of the elongated sheet of pliable material. The first and second end portions may be attached to any variable location within the center portion of the elongated sheet of pliable material using any means for attachment as described herein. In certain embodiments, the first and second end portions may be directly attached to the pair or pairs of handles (e.g., via hooks or claws) without being attached to the center portion of the elongated sheet of pliable material (as illustrated in FIG. 6). The bag or bags may then be transported by carrying the elongated sheet of pliable material over a human shoulder suspended vertically from the shoulder or worn across the body. For example, the bags may be suspended on the right side of the person's body and the strap may hang across the body being suspended over the left shoulder of the person, with the bag or bags secured on the first and second end portions of the elongated sheet pliable material. In particular, a midsection of the center portion may be rested on a human shoulder while transporting the first and second bags. FIG. 4 presents an exemplary dispenser of the apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention. Dispenser 400 may comprise a spool or a roll. A plurality of strap 100 may be produced in a continuous strip and detachable from one another by, for example, perforated cuts at predetermined lengths. A plurality of strap 100 may be wound up around dispenser 400 and dispensed. FIG. 5 presents an exemplary dispenser of the apparatus according to another embodiment of the present invention. Dispenser 500 may comprise a container or box including a detachment means 510. Detachment means 510 may comprise a cutter, blade, or any other device suitable for separating strips of strap 100.
