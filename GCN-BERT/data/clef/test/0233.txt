Step 2. tert-Butyl 5-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylphenyl)-3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1-carboxylate
tert-Butyl 5-chloro-3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1-carboxylate (500 mg, 1.498 mmol, Intermediate 1), (2-methyl-3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)methanol (446 mg, 1.798 mmol), chloro(2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-triisopropyl-1,1'-biphenyl)[2-(2'-amino-1,1'-biphenyl)]palladium(II) (Pd XPhos G2) (118 mg, 0.15 mmol) and potassium phosphate (636 mg, 3 mmol) were placed in a flask and the flask was evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Then dioxane (15 mL) and degassed water (1.5 mL) were added. The mixture was stirred at 90° C. for 2 h. After cooling to r.t., the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, and the resulting mixture was washed with brine. The separated organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate. The solvents were evaporated in vacuo and the obtained crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (190 mg, 30%).
