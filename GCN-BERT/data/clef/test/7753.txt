Technical Field The present invention relates to a fibrous membrane used for tissue repair and preparation methods and applications thereof as well as products used for tissue repair. Background Art Tissue and organ repair is a medical problem in the whole world. In modem surgeries, the repair for tissues and organs is often needed, such as hernia repair, treatment of female pelvic floor dysfunction, dura/spinal meninges coloboma repair, nerve conduit coloboma repair, blood vessel repair, ligament repair, bone coloboma repair, etc. Due to the particularity of human tissue structures and functions, the ideal fibrous membrane used for tissue repair should possess the following properties: (1) having certain strength which is resistant to mechanical stress, and able to withstand the intensity of pressure within the abdominal cavity before healthy tissue is completely formed; (2) facilitating cell adhesion, crawling and growth to achieve tissue regeneration; (3) preventing bacteria from hiding and breeding to avoid infection caused by using artificial biological synthetic materials; (4) after being implanted into a human body, keeping good dimensional stability, without shrinkage or deformation; (5) being stable in structure, convenient to be cut into required shapes without decoherence, and convenient for suture with tissue; (6) being soft in handfeel and convenient to form, thereby improving the maneuverability of the surgeries, reducing the discomfort of patients, and enhancing the effect of the surgeries; and (7) having good biocompatibility, and being capable of guiding tissue growth to achieve ideal repair. The existing fibrous membrane used for tissue repair generally has the following problems: 1) A woven mesh is most widely used in the fibrous membrane used for tissue repair, but this kind of product has rough surface, relatively hard texture and poor biocompatibility, and is easy to produce foreign body sensation and pain, causing common complications such as erosion and infection; moreover, immunological rejection caused by this material is stronger, so that more sequelae of the surgeries exist; and when being in direct contact with viscera and organs, it is easy to cause damage, and can cause relatively serious adhesion, triggering serious foreign body and immune responses, therefore a second surgery is needed for taking it out, which brings pain to the patient, and even threatens his life.2) An electrospinning membrane under the current study often has the defect that cells are difficult to grow into it or growth is slow. Thus it can be seen, the performance of the existing fibrous membrane used for tissue repair which is formed by using a weaving or electrospinning technology is not ideal.

It has regular fiber orientation, and can simulate the orientation of collagen fibers in extracellular matrix in fascia, guide cell growth, provide a directional skeleton for cells and newly secreted extracellular matrix, and structurally simulate tissue structure of the body itself as much as possible, thereby being very conducive to ingrowth of fibroblasts and capillaries, playing a key role in self-repair of muscles and fascia, and achieving long-term stable repair effect. Therefore, better postoperative repair effect can be achieved, and the recurrence rate can be reduced. In the present invention, the directional fibrous layer (B) is preferably prepared by using electrostatic spinning. The operating conditions are as follows: the rate of the micro-injection pump is adjusted to be 0.1-15.0ml/h, the voltage of the high-voltage generator is adjusted to be 5-45KV, the receiving distance of the receiving device is adjusted to be 5.0-30.0cm, the movement speed of an electrospinning needle is adjusted to be 1-20cm/s, and the rotating speed of a receiving roller is 2,000-6,000 revolutions/min. <Fibrous material> The implantable membrane of the invention can be made from non-biodegradable materials, biodegradable materials or their combination. The non-biodegradable materials mainly include fluoropolymer materials, such as PVDF and PTFE; polyolefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene; and polyurethane materials, such as PU, PCU, polyether-based polyurethane and SPU. The biodegradable materials mainly include synthetic materials such as PLA, PCL, PGA, PLGA and PDO; natural polymeric materials such as collagen, gelatin, fibrin, silk-fibroin and elastin mimetic peptide polymer; and chitosan and modified chitosan.

Other materials that may be used also include: polyethylene glycol, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polymethyl methacrylate, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate), polyphosphate, polyamino formic anhydride, polyesteramide, polyvinyl alcohol, poly(para-dioxanone), polycarbonate, alginate, chondroitin sulfate, heparin, glucosan, alginic acid, etc. <Other layers> The implantable membrane of the invention can also comprise other layers except for the fluffy fibrous layer (A) and the directional fibrous layer (B), which can be a non-oriented fibrous layer (C), a woven mesh layer (D) or a memory metal layer (E) prepared by a common electrospinning technology. The implantable membrane of the invention can also comprise a layer containing anti-infective drugs, hemostatic drugs and/or micro-nano particles, wherein the anti-infective drugs, the hemostatic drugs and/or the micro-nano particles can be positioned in the fluffy fibrous layer (A), the directional fibrous layer (B) and the non-oriented fibrous layer (C), also can be positioned in the other layers except for the above layers, and also can be adsorbed on the surface of the implantable membrane.

The fibrous membrane can also be sutured by using metal wires or polymer fibers. During the drilling treatment, methods such as stamping drilling, laser drilling and local pressure melting drilling can be used to form a through hole penetrating through the upper and lower surfaces of the fibrous membrane, wherein the laser drilling is preferable. By adjusting and optimizing parameters, after the hole is formed through laser cutting, a part of the periphery of the hole can be molten at high temperature instantly to become a dense structure, and the width of the molten part at the periphery of the hole is about 0.02-0.05mm. The molten part can play a role in fixing the pore size, and maintaining overall mechanical properties of the product. In the preparation of an implantable patch using electrostatic spinning, a receiving plate with metal and insulating staggered grids or with patterning electrostatic repulsion grains can be adopted for drilling. The long-term study of a pelvic floor repair system shows that, the pore size of the implantable membrane is crucial to the treatment effect. However, a stent prepared by a conventional electrospinning process is high in porosity, but very small in pore size; and a general pore-forming method will greatly influence the mechanical properties of the electrospinning stent. In the present invention, through research and comparison of different post-treatment technologies, and through a large number of in vitro and in vivo biological experiments, a membrane material with high mechanical strength, more softness and better treatment effect is obtained after repeated optimization, which has appropriate pore size and pore arrangement. The adoption of staggered arrangement of pores with certain sizes or combination of pores with different sizes can be more conducive to tissue ingrowth, and quick discharge of metabolites during tissue and cell growth while enhancing the exchange of internal and external materials. Meanwhile, the pores provide more space for tissue growth, thereby being more conducive to capillary penetration. In order to maintain the mechanical strength, a combination of large pores and small pores can be adopted for preparation: large pores with diameters of 0.8-1.6mm are drilled at intervals being 0.5-1cm; and 2-4 small pores with diameters of 0.4-0.6mm are uniformly drilled among every four large pores. Therefore, the number of pores can be increased while maintaining the mechanical strength of the repair patch, thus being more conducive to rapid through growth of tissues. <Implantable medical device> An implantable medical device for treating female pelvic floor dysfunction of the invention comprises the implantable membrane of the invention. Particularly, the implantable medical device can be a tension-free urinary incontinence sling or a pelvic floor repair patch. The tension-free urinary incontinence sling (hereinafter referred to as the sling) comprises a main body part and an end part, wherein the main body part is made from the implantable membrane of the invention, and the end part is used for surgical instrument traction and/or fixation. Exemplarily, the sling of the invention can have the appearance as shown in Figures 16-17. It comprises the main body part 1 and the end part 2. After the sling is implanted into a human body, the main body part 1 contacts with the anterior wall of vagina and an interlayer of urethra, and is embedded into obturator fascia to enable it to keep a tensioning state so as to exert an upward supporting force on the urethra, and the end part 2 is used for surgical instrument traction and/or fixation. The width of the sling is preferably 5mm-30mm, and its thickness is preferably 0.1mm-2mm. The main body part of the sling can have a linear (as shown in Figure 16) or corrugated (as shown in Figure 17) outer contour 3, wherein the corrugated concave-convex width difference is preferably 1mm-5mm. In a specific embodiment, the end part can also have a corrugated outer contour which is the same as or similar to that of the main body part. The sling with the corrugated outer contour is preferably used, so that the sling can be fixed more firmly in an obturator membrane of pelvis.

III. Anti-adhesion tissue repair membrane of the invention The surface layer on one side of the anti-adhesion tissue repair membrane of the invention is a fluffy fibrous layer (A'), and the surface layer on the other side is an anti-adhesion layer (B'); and the fluffy fibrous layer (A') is formed by interweaving fibrous filaments with diameters of 10nm-100µm, and has a porous structure, with the fluffiness of 200-2,000cm3/g, and the softness of 50-500mN. The anti-adhesion tissue repair membrane of the invention has at least the above two-layer structure, wherein an intermediate layer can be optionally arranged between the fluffy fibrous layer (A') and the anti-adhesion layer (B'), without special restrictions on materials, structures and preparation methods of the intermediate layer, and any materials, structures and preparation methods which can be used for tissue repair in the prior art may be used. <Fluffy fibrous layer (A')> The fluffy fibrous layer (A') of the anti-adhesion tissue repair membrane of the invention adopts the above fibrous membrane used for tissue repair of the invention, and can be prepared by a method the same as the preparation method of the fibrous membrane. The fluffy fibrous layer (A') of the anti-adhesion tissue repair membrane of the invention is formed by interweaving fibrous filaments with diameters of 10nm-100µm, and has a porous structure, with the fluffiness of 200-2,000cm3/g, and the preferable softness of 50-500mN.

Further, the average pore size of the fluffy fibrous layer (A') of the invention is preferably 50-500µm, the thickness is 0.1-2.0mm, preferably 0.1-1.0mm, more preferably 0.2-1.0mm, and the tensile strength is preferably 20-80N/cm. <Fibrous materials> The fluffy fibrous layer (A') and the intermediate layer of the invention can be made from the fibrous materials including non-biodegradable materials, biodegradable materials or their combination. The non-biodegradable materials mainly include fluoropolymer materials, such as PVDF and PTFE; polyolefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene; and polyurethane materials, such as PU, PCU, polyether-based polyurethane and SPU. The biodegradable materials mainly include synthetic materials such as PLA, PCL, PGA, PLGA and PDO; natural polymeric materials such as collagen, gelatin, fibrin, silk-fibroin and elastin mimetic peptide polymer; and chitosan and modified chitosan. The fluffy fibrous layer (A'), the fibrous layer (D) and other layers can be made from same or different fibrous materials, wherein the fluffy fibrous layer (A') is preferably prepared from PVDF, PCU and PLA. Other materials that may be used also include: polyethylene glycol, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polymethyl methacrylate, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate), polyphosphate, polyamino formic anhydride, polyesteramide, polyvinyl alcohol, poly(para-dioxanone), polycarbonate, alginate, chondroitin sulfate, heparin, glucosan, alginic acid, etc. <Anti-adhesion layer (B')> The anti-adhesion layer (B') of the invention is combined with other layers by means of spraying or ultrasonic welding. When the anti-adhesion tissue repair membrane of the invention is a double-layer membrane, the anti-adhesion layer (B) is preferably compounded with the fluffy fibrous layer (A') by means of spraying. Through this manner, the anti-adhesion layer (B') can infiltrate into the fluffy fibrous layer (A') to be tightly combined with it. The anti-adhesion layer obtained by spraying has certain micropores, so as to have the anti-adhesion effect while guaranteeing the supply of nutrients. In a spraying process, a solution is squeezed out through hydraulic pressure, and atomized at a nozzle to form some tiny droplets which are connected with one another after contacting with the fluffy fibrous layer (A') and infiltrating into surface fibers, so that a part of pores formed in the fibers are closed, and the micropores formed by the droplets can be controlled by controlling the sizes and spacing of the droplets. The diameters of the micropores obtained by this method can be within the range of 0.05-3µm. The anti-adhesion layer (B') obtained by spraying has certain softness and compliance, so that it can produce corresponding deformation under the condition that the fluffy fibrous layer (A') is stressed, so as to ensure the tight combination of them under stress. Spraying fluid for the anti-adhesion layer (B') is preferably prepared by using a chitosan and/or carboxymethyl chitosan solution. The molecular weight of the chitosan and/or carboxymethyl chitosan is preferably 300,000-1,000,000, more preferably 500,000-800,000, and its degradation time is about 1-3 months. A solvent for the chitosan and/or carboxymethyl chitosan solution can be an acetic acid aqueous solution, hydrochloric acid, dilute sulphuric acid, dilute nitric acid, purified water, etc. The solvent is preferably the acetic acid aqueous solution, wherein the content of acetic acid is 1%-36% (mass fraction), preferably 3%-15%. The concentration of chitosan and/or carboxymethyl chitosan in the acetic acid aqueous solution is 1%-15% (mass/volume fraction), preferably 3%-8%. The spraying fluid for spraying the anti-adhesion layer (B') does not have special restrictions on an adopted spraying device. But the spraying device needs to be sealed, and can enable feed liquid loaded therein to be pressed by means of pressurizing so as to be sprayed out from a nozzle of the spraying device. The spraying method described below is preferably used in the present invention, which includes the following steps: (1) dissolving chitosan and/or carboxymethyl chitosan in a solution to form anti-adhesion layer spraying fluid;(2) putting the anti-adhesion layer spraying fluid into a spraying device connected with a hydraulic press, setting the range of spraying parameters as follows: spraying flow, 0.005ml/min-0.lml/min; scanning spacing, 10mm-30mm; and scanning speed, 1mm/s-50mm/s; spraying the anti-adhesion layer spraying fluid on one surface of the fluffy fibrous layer (A'), the woven layer (C), the fibrous layer (D) or other intermediate layers;(3) post-treatment: soaking and drying, soaking a sample obtained in step (2) in an aqueous solution, removing residual solvent and then putting into an air dry oven for drying, with the drying temperature set to be 35-60 DEG C, and the treatment time of 2 days. After the above spraying and post-treatment, cutting, packaging, EO sterilization and other steps can be carried out according to needs. <Intermediate layer> In the anti-adhesion tissue repair membrane of the invention, the intermediate layer can be arranged between the fluffy fibrous layer (A') and the anti-adhesion layer (B'), which can be the woven layer (C'), the fibrous layer (D') or other layers that can be used in the tissue repair membrane, such as a drug layer. The anti-adhesion tissue repair membrane of the invention can have three-layer, four-layer or multi-layer structures. The first surface layer is the fluffy fibrous layer (A'), which is a fibrous layer with a specific fluffy structure, and also a fibrous membrane capable of rapidly promoting tissue repair and regeneration. The fibrous membrane is formed by interweaving fibrous filaments with diameters of 10nm-100µm, and has a porous structure, with the fluffiness of 200-2,000cm3/g. The intermediate layer can be the woven layer (C'), or the fibrous layer (D') or a combination thereof, wherein the woven layer (C') is a woven mesh used for enhancing the strength of the overall patch; and the fibrous layer (D') can be a fibrous layer obtained by electrospinning, preferably a fibrous layer with a fluffy structure the same as the structure of the first layer. The surface layer on the other side is the anti-adhesion layer (B') made from a material having an anti-adhesion function. The fibrous layer with the fluffy structure and the woven mesh layer can be combined together by means of ultrasonic spot welding, suture, etc. The anti-adhesion layer and the intermediate layer can be combined together by means of spraying, ultrasonic welding, etc., preferably spraying. According to the woven layer (C') of the invention, the woven mesh (which can be made from PP, PVDF, PTFE, PET, etc.) is preferably completely soaked in a polymer solution with certain concentration. The polymer material is preferably consistent with the fibrous material of the fluffy fibrous layer (A). After being soaked for a certain period of time, the woven mesh is taken out and oven dried by heating to enable fibrous filaments on the woven mesh to be wrapped with a relatively thin layer of polymer material. The above anti-adhesion tissue repair membrane with the multi-layer structure is preferably used for repairing abdominal hernia and incisional hernia. This design is adopted for the following main reasons: (1) as the repair for the abdominal hernia and incisional hernia has higher requirements for mechanical strength, a common simple electrospinning membrane is difficult to meet the requirements, therefore the woven mesh is additionally arranged to ensure the mechanical strength; (2) for the hernia repair by using the simple woven mesh, repaired and grown tissues cannot be well combined with the woven mesh, so that the woven mesh cannot be fixed, and is easy to form erosion and shrinkage. Hence, two sides of the woven mesh are respectively and additionally provided with a layer of fibrous membrane with the specific fluffy structure, so as to enable the tissues to be well repaired and wrap the woven mesh to avoid its erosion and shrinkage; and (3) in the repair of the abdominal hernia and incisional hernia, the patch is required to have the anti-adhesion function for intraperitoneal repair, in order to prevent intestinal obstruction, necrosis and the like caused by adhesion of new tissue to intra-abdominal organs, so that a fourth-layer material with the anti-adhesion function is designed for the patch. The anti-adhesion tissue repair membrane with the four-layer structure of the invention can be prepared by adopting the following method: (1) preparing two fibrous membranes with specific fluffy structures and specific thickness according to the aforementioned preparation method of the fluffy fibrous layer (A');(2) completely soaking a woven mesh (which can be made from PP, PVDF, PTFE, PET, etc.) meeting the requirements for the mechanical strength in a polymer solution with certain concentration, wherein the polymer material should be consistent with the material of the fibrous membranes in step (1); and after soaking for a certain period of time, taking out the woven mesh and oven drying by heating to enable fibrous filaments on the woven mesh to be wrapped with a relatively thin layer of polymer material;(3) placing the woven mesh wrapped with the polymer obtained in step (2) between the two fibrous membranes in step (1), then placing on an ultrasonic welding machine together, and under certain ultrasonic power and pressure, welding the two fibrous membranes on two sides of the woven mesh;(4) spraying the anti-adhesion material on one surface of the membrane prepared in step (3) by adopting the aforementioned spraying technology.

New Zealand rabbit experiments are carried out by using the above hernia repair patches. There are a total of 60 New Zealand rabbits, weighing 2.5-2.8Kg each, and aged 6-12 months. These experimental rabbits are randomly divided into four groups, namely a PCU group, a PVDF1 group, a PVDF2 group and a PP group respectively, with 15 experimental animals in each group. The animal in the experiment is anesthetized and subjected to skin preparation, lies on its back and is fixed on a board; after a surgical drape is disinfected, the skin at the center of the abdomen is incised by using a scalpel No. 4 along a white line on the rabbit's abdomen to form an incision that is about 8cm long and expose muscles, the full-thickness abdominal wall with the size of 2cm x 5cm (including peritoneum, muscles and fascia tissues) is resected; the PCU group, the PVDF1 group, the PVDF2 group and the PP group respectively adopt the PCU hernia repair patch, the PVDF1 hernia repair patch, the PVDF2 hernia repair patch and the PP hernia repair patch, and silk threads No.0 are used for interrupted suture between the patches and surrounding muscles while silk threads No.4 are used for interrupted suture between skin. Postoperative routine observation and feeding for the animals are carried out. During the observation period, all the animals in the PCU group, the PVDF1 group and the PVDF2 group can take food and drink water normally, and the incisions are healed well, without infection or formation of abdominal hernia. The incisions of the five animals in the PP group bulge 5-7 days after surgery, three animals die 7-10 days after surgery, and it is found that severe adhesion is formed between the patches and viscera during anatomy. All the rest of the animals survive to the sampling time. One month after surgery, five animals in each of the PCU group, the PVDF1 group and the PVDF2 group are dissected, while four animals in the PP group are dissected. Surgical sites of the animals in the PCU group and the PVDF1 group are soft in touch, while those of the animals in the PVDF2 group are slightly hard in touch compared with the PVDF1 group. The muscle layers are incised 2cm above the edges of the patches, the patches of the PCU group, the PVDF1 group and the PVDF2 group are not adhered to the viscera visually, blood capillaries grow into the center along the edges of the patches, and new tissues have basically covered the entire patches. Microscopic results show that a lot of hyperplasia of fibroblasts and collagen fibers, little lymphocyte infiltration (≤25/HPF) and more blood capillary hyperplasia (5-10/HPF) are visible around the patches of the PCU group, the PVDF1 group and the PVDF2 group. And microscopically, there are more blood capillaries in the PCU group and the PVDF1 group compared with the PVDF2 group, and the difference is statistically significant (P<0.05). Thus it can be seen, the patches of the PCU group, the PVDF1 group and the PVDF2 group have better histocompatibility, wherein the higher fluffiness of the patches of the PCU group and the PVDF1 group is more advantageous to tissue ingrowth. The surgical sites of the PP group are harder in touch than other three groups, and the presence of foreign bodies can be obviously felt. After incision of skin, it can be seen, a thin layer of new tissue covers the surface of each patch, but is easy to be torn from the patch. The muscle layers are incised 2cm around the patches, and the patches of the PP group are seriously adhered to viscera visually, and are not easy to separate (Figure 5). Microscopic results show that there are more holes inside the patches of the PP group, a small quantity of fibroblasts and collagen are formed around the holes, and a small amount of blood capillary hyperplasia (≤2/HPF), and a large amount of infiltration of foreign body giant cells and lymphocytes are visible. Thus it can be seen, the patches of the PP group have poorer histocompatibility, and are not conducive to cell adhesion and obvious in rejection and immune inflammatory response. Three months after surgery, four animals in the PP group are dissected, and five animals in each of the other groups are dissected. The patches and tissues within the range of 2cm around the patches are incised. The surgical sites of the PCU group and the PVDF1 group are soft in touch, and close to autologous tissues. The patches and skin are clear in layers, and easy to be separated from each other. No adhesion exists between the patches and visceral organs, and a large number of new tissues grow into the patches. Microscopic results show that the peripheries of the patches are tightly combined with collagen fibers and fibrocytes; and a large number of collagen fibers are visible inside the patches, with a small number of blood capillaries (3-5/HPF). The surgical sites of the materials in the PVDF2 group are softer in touch, the patches and the skin are clear in layers, and easy to be separated from each other. No adhesion exists between the patches and visceral organs, and after incision of the inside of the patches, new tissues are few. Microscopic results show that more collagen fibers are visible only on the surfaces of the patches, and there are no new tissues inside the patches, thus it can be seen, the growth of new tissues to the inside of the PVDF2 membrane is slower. The surgical sites of the PP group are harder in touch, and the presence of foreign bodies can be obviously felt. There is a relatively thin layer of new tissue on the surface of each patch of the PP group. The new tissue and the skin are unclear in layers, and not easy to be separated from each other. The patches are close to viscera with serious adhesion to the viscera, and difficult to tear, and intestinal tract swells. Microscopic results show that a small quantity of fibroblasts and collagen are formed around the patches, with a relatively small amount of blood capillary hyperplasia (≤2/HPF); and a large amount of infiltration of foreign body giant cells and lymphocytes shows obvious rejection and immune inflammatory response. Six months after surgery, four animals in the PP group are dissected, and five animals in each of the other groups are dissected. The patches at repaired parts and tissues within the range of 2cm around the patches are incised. The surgical sites of the PVDF1 group and the PCU group are very soft in touch, as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 9, the patches has been integrated with new tissues which are difficult to be distinguished from the patches, the new tissues and the skin are clear in layers, and easy to be separated from each other. No adhesion exists between the new tissues and visceral organs. Microscopic observation results show that the peripheries of the parts implanted with the patches are tightly combined with collagen fibers and fibrocytes; and a large number of collagen fibers are visible inside the patches. The surgical sites of the PVDF2 group are softer in touch, as shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8, the patches and the new tissues still can be distinguished from each other. The new tissues and the skin are clear in layers, and easy to be separated from each other. No adhesion exists between the patches and visceral organs. Microscopic observation results show that more collagen fibers are visible on the surfaces of the patches, and after incision of the inside of the patches, there are still fewer new tissues. The surgical sites of the PP group are harder in touch, and the presence of foreign bodies can be obviously felt. The patches of the PP group and the skin are unclear in layers, and cannot be separated from each other; serious adhesion exists between the patches and visceral organs; microscopic observation results show that a small quantity of fibroblasts and collagen are formed only around the patches, with a small amount of blood capillary hyperplasia (≤5/HPF) and a large amount of infiltration of foreign body giant cells and lymphocytes visible on the surfaces, and foreign body reaction and immune rejection are serious; and this shows that the patches of the PP group are not conducive to cell adhesion and ingrowth, and have poor histocompatibility and repair effect. Example 9 Application of fibrous membrane in pelvic floor repair Miniature pig experiments are carried out by adopting a pelvic floor repair patch (PVDF3 patch) made from a fibrous membrane prepared in Example 3, a pelvic floor repair patch (PVDF4 patch) made from a fibrous membrane prepared in step 2 of Example 3, a pelvic floor repair patch (PCU1 patch) made from a fibrous membrane prepared in Example 6 and a pelvic floor repair patch made from a polypropylene material (PP patch, provided by the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Hospital of Johnson&Johnson ProliftTM). All the patches are cut into 2cm×2cm pieces. Eight female miniature pigs with weight of 20-25kg and sexual maturity are selected, and divided into four groups, namely PVDF3 group, PVDF4 group, PCU1 group and PP group, with two pigs in each group. The miniature pigs in the experiments are subjected to general anesthesia, and the abdominal walls of lower abdomens are incised to expose bladders, uteruses and upper sections of vaginas. The patches are respectively implanted between gaps of the vaginas and the bladders, and fixed by silk threads. The PVDF3 patch, the PVDF4 patch, the PCU1 patch and the PP patch are respectively used in the PVDF3 group, the PVDF4 group, the PCU1 group and the PP group serving as a control group. Postoperative routine feeding and observation for the animals are carried out. During the observation period, all the experimental animals are good in performance, and the incisions are healed well, without expulsion or exposure of implanted materials. The animals can take food and drink water normally after surgery, and all survive to the sampling time. Four weeks after surgery, bladder and vagina interstitial tissue specimens, including the pelvic floor repair patches, are incised. For the PVDF3 group, the PVDF4 group, the PCU1 patch and the PP group, the surgical sites of the PP material is the hardest in touch, followed by the material of the PVDF4 group, the material of the PCU1 group is soft, and the material of the PVDF3 group is the softest with toughness. The surfaces of the patches of the PVDF3 group, the PVDF4 group and the PCU1 group are respectively covered with a layer of new epithelium, the patches are not easy to be torn from new tissues, new blood capillaries are visually, the surfaces of the patches in the PP group are also respectively covered with a layer of new tissues, and the patches are easy to be separated from the new tissues. Pathological results show that there is a large amount of hyperplasia of fibroblasts and collagen fibers inside the patches of the PVDF3 group and on the surfaces thereof, and more blood capillaries (5-10/HPF) exist inside the patches, thus it can be seen, new tissues have grown into the membrane at a relatively high speed. There are more fibroblasts and collagen fibers on the surfaces of the patches in the PCU1 group and the PVDF4 group, and a small amount of hyperplasia of fibroblasts and collagen fibers, as well as a small amount of blood capillary hyperplasia (3-5/HPF) are visible inside the patches, it shows that new tissues have grown into the membrane at a relatively low speed. A little of lymphocyte infiltration is visible inside the patches in the PVDF4 group, with a mild immune inflammatory response. There are more fibroblasts and collagen, a relatively small number of blood capillaries (2-3/HPF), and a small number of foreign body giant cells (≤3/HPF) around the patches in the PP group, thus it can be seen, new tissues cannot grow into a whole with the membrane, and repair is slower, with foreign body rejection reaction. Twelve weeks after surgery, vagina and bladder samples, including the pelvic floor repair implanted materials, are incised. For the PVDF3 group, the PVDF4 group, the PCU1 group and the PP group, the PP material is the hardest in touch, followed by the PVDF4 material, and there is a relatively obvious difference between softness of the repaired parts and surrounding tissues; and the PCU1 material is soft in touch, and the PVDF3 is the softest with toughness. A large quantity of fibroblasts and collagen are visible on the surfaces of the patches in the PVDF3 group and inside such patches, and the patches are integrated with grown tissues and cannot be distinguished and separated from them. Microscopic observation results show that the peripheries of the parts implanted with the patches are tightly combined with collagen fibers and fibrocytes, new tissues cannot be distinguished from the membrane material, a large number of collagen fibers are visible inside the patches, and the new tissues have grown into a whole with the membrane completely to realize regeneration and repair. The patches of the PCU1 group are not easy to be separated from the new tissues which have grown into the material visually, and the material is difficult to be distinguished from the new tissues. Microscopic observation results show that a large number of fibroblasts and a small number of blood capillaries (3-5/HPF) grow on the surfaces of the patches, and a relatively small number of blood capillaries (2-3/HPF) are visible inside the patches. The patches of the PVDF4 group can be separated from the new tissues, more fibroblasts and a small number of blood capillaries (3-5/HPF) grow on the surfaces of the patches, and a relatively small number of blood capillaries (≤2/HPF) are visible inside the patches. Growth of more fibroblasts and a relatively small number of blood capillaries (2-3/HPF) is also visible on the surfaces of the patches in PP group, but the patches can be easily separated from grown tissues, thus it can be seen, the new tissues cannot grow into a whole with the membrane, and the repair effect is poorer. It can be seen, the fluffiness of the implanted patches plays an important role in quick adhesion of cells and tissues to the surfaces of the implanted patches and their growth into the materials, and high fluffiness and softness of the patches are more advantageous to the integration of the new tissues and the materials; and lower fluffiness will lead to relatively slow growth of the new tissues into the membrane. Example 10 application of fibrous membrane in dura repair A fibrous membrane used for tissue repair prepared in Example 4 and a fibrous membrane prepared in step (2) of Example 4 are cut into 4cm x 6cm pieces which are cleaned, sterilized and respectively made into a PLLA1 dura repair patch (made from the fibrous membrane of Example 4), and a PLLA2 dura repair patch (made from the fibrous membrane obtained in step (2) of Example 4), and a commercial clinically used dura repair patch of animal origin (NAOMOJIAN, a sample provided by the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University) is adopted in a control group. Six male or female healthy dogs are selected, with the weight being 10-15kg, and an observation period of 2-3 months. General anesthesia and double-top craniotomy are carried out for each dog in the experiment, with man-made bilateral partial dura defect and injury of brain tissue, and then dura neoplasty is implemented on both sides of the same experimental dog's brain respectively by using the PLLA1 dura repair patch and the PLLA2 dura repair patch, with three dogs in parallel experiments. The dura neoplasty is implemented on both sides of the same experimental dog's brain respectively by using the PLLA2 dura repair patch and the dura repair patch of animal origin in the control group, with three dogs in parallel experiments. Postoperative routine feeding and observation for the dogs are carried out, specimens are collected on the repair patches at the end of each observation period, and comparative observation on gross specimens and microscopic tissues is carried out. After being fed for a set period of time, all the experimental animals are anesthetized, skulls are exposed according to the aforementioned craniotomy, the external surfaces of the repair patches are separated and exposed, the animals are sacrificed through intravenous injection of air, and after the skulls are sawn, the repair patches and surrounding tissues are opened and incised. The external surfaces and texture of the repair patches, their relationships with surrounding tissues, the presence of cysts or induration, and adhesion between the internal surfaces and brain tissues are visually observed. The specimens are bottled and soaked in formalin stationary liquid, and the specimen bottle is labeled. After formalin fixation is carried out at room temperature for one week, local tissues at surgical sites are taken and embedded with conventional paraffin, and histological sections are stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). The six dogs are recovered well after surgery, and the incisions are healed well without secretion. After surgery, the dogs can take food and drink water normally, and their outdoor activities are normal, without dyskinesia. Three months later, the dogs are sacrificed through intravenous injection of air, and specimens are incised within the range of greater than 1cm around the surgical sites by taking the surgical sites as centers, so that the specimens include the repair patches, peripheral dura and brain tissues on the internal surfaces. After the specimens are incised out, skulls and meninges are separated from each other layer by layer, it can be seen, the meninges at the parts implanted with the PLLA1 dura repair patches are complete, the parts implanted with the patches have been completely replaced with fibrous tissues, the implanted materials are invisible, the meningeal internal surfaces at the implantation sites do not have adhesion, and brain tissues corresponding to the meninges have smooth surfaces without adhesion. The repair effect is shown in Figure 13 which is an anatomical figure, and a pathologic figure is shown as Figure 10; the meninges at the parts implanted with the PLLA2 dura repair patches are complete, it can be seen, partial implanted materials have been split into fragments to form new fibrous tissues, there is a little adhesion on the surfaces of brain tissues corresponding to the meninges, the repair effect is shown in Figure 14 which is an anatomical figure, and a pathologic figure is shown as Figure 11. While complete undegraded implanted patches are still visible at the parts implanted with the dura repair patches of animal origin in the control group, and there is more adhesion between the meningeal internal surfaces at the implantation sites and the brain tissues, which will cause complications such as ectopic discharge of brain tissues and seizures, the repair effect is shown in Figure 15 which is an anatomical figure, and a pathologic figure is shown as Figure 12. Example 11 Application of fibrous membrane in skin repair The fibrous membrane used for tissue repair prepared in Example 4 is cut into 5cm x 5cm pieces which are cleaned, sterilized and made into artificial skin for carrying out animal experiments. There are a total of 12 male or female experimental rabbits, weighing 2-2.5kg, and aged 6-8 months. The experimental rabbits are randomly divided into two groups (an experimental group and a control group), with six rabbits in each group. After intravenous anesthesia for ear margin of each rabbit, the animal is placed on a special operating table, and then subjected to skin preparation and disinfection. The full-thickness skin on the back is excised with a scalpel, with the excision area of 4cm x 4cm. Then artificial dermis is attached: for the experimental group, the artificial skin made from the fibrous membrane of Example 4 is pasted on a trauma, and fixed with suture lines at interval of 1cm. Blank control treatment is carried out for the control group. For both the experimental group and the control group, wounds are respectively covered with a layer of sterile oil gauze and sterile gauze which are fixed with the surrounding skin by using suture lines. After surgery, animals are observed to find out whether their feeding, drinking and body temperature are normal or not, and the time of separation of covering from the wounds of each group, other physiological activities as well as the repair of the wounds are also observed. At the two, four and eight weeks after surgery, two rabbits of each group are sacrificed, the entire wound on the back and adjacent normal skin are taken, fixed with formalin, and stained with HE, and neogenesis of tissues in dermis, inflammatory reaction, the thickness of epidermis structure and regeneration of appendant organs are observed under a light microscope. All the wounds of the rabbits in the control group are adhered to the oil gauze or the gauze after surgery. Shedding of auxiliary materials exists, and the wounds bleed, with a lot of tissue fluid exudation. After being healed completely, the wounds have linear scabs. For the experimental group, the wounds are dry after surgery, without adhesion to the oil gauze or the gauze which is closely clung to the wounds. The wounds are not reddish, swollen or hot, without skin irritation or infection of the animals. There is no necrosis phenomenon under the covering materials. After being healed completely, the wounds have rectangular scabs. Through observation under a microscope, prickle cell layers of skin on healed wounds are thickened, basal cell hyperplasia is active, and cuticles of cuticular layers, acanthosis layers of granular layers and basal layers are all visible. The appendant organs of dermis layers, sweat glands, hair follicles and other structures are visible, it can be seen, a large number of fibroblasts are arranged parallel to the surface of the skin, among which there is more blood capillary hyperplasia, and a small amount of local lymphocytic infiltration. Observation results show that the anti-infective capability and effect of preventing wound bleeding of the experimental group are superior to those of the control group. For the experimental group, the wounds are not reddish or swollen, without necrosis. Histological observation shows that the artificial skin material made from the fibrous membrane of Example 4 has better capability of promoting skin structure regeneration compared with the control group. Example 12 Application of fibrous membrane in bone filling The fibrous membrane used for tissue repair prepared in Example 2 is cleaned, sterilized and made into a bone repair stent for carrying out rabbit animal experiments. There are three New Zealand rabbits, weighing 2.5±0.5Kg, including one female rabbit, and two male rabbits. Skin preparation is carried out after general anesthesia, each animal is placed on a special operating table in a prone position, disinfected with iodophor alcohol, and sterile dressing is laid and fixed with a pair of towel forceps. Skin on the rabbit's leg is incised, periosteum is separated by using a detacher to expose tibia bone lamella, a 1cm x 2cm tibia defect of the rabbit is made by using a high-speed bone drill, a bone repair stent prepared from the fibrous membrane of Example 2 is folded to be fan-shaped and inserted into the defect, and the height of the filler is adjusted to enable the filler to be flush with the bone defect surface for suture. At 14 days after surgery, through visual observation, bone trabecula is relatively thick, through testing of an ultrasonic bone mineral density instrument, new sclerotin is compact, and more woven bones are formed. Three months after surgery, porosis occurs on the surface of a defective bone cavity. During percussion, poroma is hard in texture, with hardness similar to that of normal bone tissues, and its color is consistent with that of autologous bones. No inflammatory response occurs during recovery. After surgery, the animals are recovered well, and can take food and drink water normally. After the limb movement function is recovered gradually, dyskinesia is not found. The above examples are sufficient to illustrate the beneficial effects brought about when the fluffiness of the fibrous membrane of the invention is 200-2,000cm3/g, which can be summarized as follows: Table 1Application typesApplication for hernia repairApplication for pelvic floor repairApplication for dura repairMaterialsPCUPVDF1PVDF2PPPVDF3PCU1PVDF4PPPLLA1PLLA2Animal originFluffiness (cm3/g)9701,300170851,530230170761,100130180Softness (mN)2504509301,3404204709301,100400870930Repair effectsABCDEFGHIJKA: Very soft, with good compliance with tissues. New tissues rapidly grow inside and outside the patches, without adhesion to visceral tissues. B: Very soft, with good compliance with tissues. New tissues rapidly grow inside and outside the patches, without adhesion to visceral tissues. C: Relatively soft, with general compliance with tissues. New tissues slowly grow inside and outside the patches, without adhesion to visceral tissues. D: Relatively hard, with poorer compliance with tissues. No new tissues grow inside and outside the patches, with serious adhesion to the tissues. E: Very soft, with toughness. New tissues rapidly grow, and the patches are integrated with the new tissues, which cannot be distinguished or separated from each other. F: Soft, new tissues grow relatively fast, and the patches and the new tissues are not easy to be separated from each other. G: Relatively soft, new tissues slowly grow, and the patches and the new tissues can be distinguished and separated from each other, but relatively difficult. H: Relatively hard, no new tissues grow inside and outside the patches, and the patches and the tissues are relatively easy to be separated from each other. I: Soft, new tissues can be rapidly formed to repair dura, the material is degraded relatively fast, and no adhesion occurs between the new tissues and brain tissues. J: Relatively hard, growth of new tissues and dura repair are relatively slow compared with the PLLA1 material, the material is degraded relatively slow, and a little adhesion occurs between the new tissues and brain tissues. K: Relatively hard, growth of new tissues and dura repair are slow compared with the PLLA2 material, the material is degraded relatively slow, and more adhesion occurs between the new tissues and brain tissues. It can be seen from the table above, the tissue repair patches with the fluffiness controlled to be 200-2,000cm3/g can induce rapid growth of cells in the patches to form new tissues so as to achieve the repair effect. Also it can be seen that for the biodegradable material (PLLA), compared with the patches with the fluffiness beyond the range of 200-2,000cm3/g, the patches with the fluffiness within this range have faster repair effect, and the material is degraded faster. Further, after being repaired by using the patches with the softness within the range of 50-500mN, the postoperative comfort is significantly improved due to relative softness of the repaired parts. <Preparation of implantable fibrous membrane used for repair: Examples 13-21> Example 13 (1) The PVDF is dissolved in a mixed solvent of N,N-dimethyl formamide/acetone with the volume ratio of 4:6, and the concentration of the PVDF in the solution is adjusted to be 18g/100mL to obtain a homogeneous fibrous material solution A; and the PLLA is dissolved in an HFIP solution, and the concentration of the PLLA in the solution is adjusted to be 5g/100mL to obtain a homogeneous fibrous material solution B.

The above materials are all cut into 2cm x 2cm membranes. A total of 28 healthy female miniature pigs with sexual maturity, weighing 20kg-25kg, are selected and randomly divided into seven groups, with four pigs in each group. Each miniature pig is subjected to general anesthesia and fixed in an overhead position. The abdominal wall of lower abdomen is incised to expose bladder, uterus and an upper section of vagina. The membranes are respectively implanted between gaps of the vagina and the bladder, and fixed with silk threads. Postoperative routine feeding and observation for the animals are carried out. During the observation period, all the experimental animals are good in performance, and the incisions are healed well, without protrusion or exposure of implanted materials, or reddening and swelling of surgical sites. The animals are normal in drinking and feeding, as well as mental state after surgery, and all survive to the sampling time in a space enough for activities. Four weeks after surgery, two animals of each group are sacrificed, and vagina and bladder interstitial tissue specimens, including the repair patches, are incised. For the softness of implanted materials, the PP mesh in the control group I obviously becomes hard in touch, with foreign body sensation, followed by the softness of the control group II, and the softness of all the patches in the experimental groups is greatly improved. Specifically, the softness of the patches in groups IV, V and VII is optimal with toughness, and close to that of autologous tissues. Through comparison between tissue ingrowth inside materials and growth with surrounding new tissues, by general observation, the tissue ingrowth and bonding strength with the surrounding new tissues of the membranes in the experimental groups (III-VII) are more excellent compared with the PP mesh in the control group I and the membrane in the control group II, which is manifested as follows: the surfaces of the membranes in the experimental groups are respectively covered with a layer of new epithelial tissues, the vascularization degree is higher, and the membranes and the new tissues are not easy to be separated from each other; wherein the anatomical effect after implantation of the PVDF material in group IV for four weeks is shown in Figure 20, it can be seen, there is no difference between the new tissues at implantation sites and surrounding tissues. The surfaces of the PP mesh in the control group I and the membrane in the control group II are also covered with a layer of new tissues, but blood capillaries on the new tissues are sparse; moreover, the PP mesh in the control group I is easy to be separated from the patch, as shown in Figure 21, after being separated from the new tissues, the material is still a grid that is harder in texture, without ingrowth of new tissues; it can be seen, the experimental groups have better cell and tissue ingrowth effect, as well as stronger compatibility and binding capability with the new tissues. Pathological results show that there are a large amount of hyperplasia of fibroblasts and collagen fibers on the surfaces of the implantable membranes in groups III-VII and inside these membranes, and more blood capillaries (3-5/HPF) exist inside the patches; wherein a large number of blood capillaries (5-10/HPF) exist inside the patches in group V. Thus it can be seen, new tissues have grown into the membranes at a relatively high speed, the vascularization degree is high, and higher fluffiness is more advantageous to cell crawling and proliferation, as well as rapid tissue ingrowth. There are more fibroblasts and collagen fibers on the surfaces of the fibrous membranes in group II, and a small amount of hyperplasia of fibroblasts and collagen fibers, a little infiltration of lymphocytes (<5/HPF), as well as a small amount of blood capillary hyperplasia (2-3/HPF) are visible inside the patches, it shows that new tissues have grown into the membranes at relatively low speed, with a mild immune inflammatory response. There are a large number of fibroblasts and collagen, a relatively small number of blood capillaries (<2/HPF), and a small number of foreign body giant cells (≤3/HPF) around the PP mesh in group I, thus it can be seen, new tissues cannot grow into a whole with the membranes, and repair is slower, with foreign body rejection reaction. Observation is continued till 12 weeks after surgery, during the period, the miniature pigs implanted with the PP mesh in group I show dysphoria, such as friction on inner walls and rails, and tail biting, and are in a poor mental state. The rest of the experimental miniature pigs are normal in activities, and are bred in a broad breeding site. Twelve weeks after surgery, two animals of each group are sacrificed, and vagina and bladder specimens, including the pelvic floor repair implanted materials, are incised. Upon touching with hands, the PP mesh material in group I still remains certain hardness compared with that in four weeks after surgery, with obvious foreign body sensation; the fibrous membrane in group II is softer, but there is still obvious distinction between implantation sites and surrounding tissues in touch; the softness of the implantable membranes in experimental groups III-VII is basically close to that of autologous tissues, and there is basically no obvious difference between the parts implanted with the materials and surrounding tissues in handfeel; wherein the material in group V is almost consistent with the autologous tissues in touch. Through visual observation, the materials of the implantable membranes in groups III-VII are integrated with grown tissues, cannot be distinguished or separated from the tissues, and are close to human tissues on the whole, and blood vessels can be clearly seen. Microscopic observation results show that the peripheries of the implantable membranes in groups III-VII are tightly combined with collagen fibers and fibrocytes, new tissues and membrane materials cannot be distinguished from each other, a large number of collagen fibers are visible inside the membranes, it can be seen, the new tissues have grown into a whole with the membranes completely, and reconstruction and repair are realized; and pathological results show that a large number of fibroblasts and collagen are visible on the surfaces of the materials and inside these materials, no foreign body giant cells or lymphocytes are visible, and the materials and new tissues are integrated, thus being difficult to distinguish. It can be seen, higher fluffiness is more advantageous to induction of cell ingrowth and tissue regeneration, suitable softness is more advantageous to binding of new tissues at implantation sites and surrounding tissues, and notably, the new tissues do not cause foreign body sensation in the body, or friction damage to new or autologous tissues. Through visual observation, the fibrous membrane in group II can be separated from new tissues, and more blood capillaries are visible on the surface; microscopic observation results show that there is an obvious boundary between the periphery of the fibrous membrane in group II and collagen fibers and fibrocytes in combination, the new tissues and the membrane material are easy to be distinguished from each other, there are a large number of collagen fibers and rich blood capillaries on the surface, and the material is still visible inside the membrane; pathological results show that more fibroblasts and a large number of blood capillaries (5-10/HPF) grow on the surface of the material, a small number of blood capillaries (≤3/HPF) and foreign body giant cells (1/HPF) are visible inside the membrane, it can be seen, the new tissues have grown into the membrane, but the new tissues are relatively few, with mild foreign body response. For the PP mesh in group I, four-level adhesion (by adopting a Nari adhesion scoring method 1) occurs between the repaired parts and surrounding tissues, the material is easier to be separated from grown tissues, the PP material can be clearly seen, and no new tissue ingrowth or penetration is visible inside the material; and pathological results show that a small number of fibroblasts and collagen are formed only around the material, more blood capillary hyperplasia (3-5/HPF) and a large amount of infiltration of foreign body giant cells and lymphocytes are visible on the surface, and foreign body response and immune rejection are serious, it can be seen, the new tissues cannot grow into a whole with the membrane, and the repair effect is poor. Meanwhile, presumably the dysphoria of corresponding experimental pigs in the observation process may be caused by strong foreign body sensation and tissue infection response. Example 22 A double-layer fibrous membrane (hereinafter referred to as disordered fluffy membrane) is prepared from a non-oriented fibrous layer (C) obtained by conventional electrospinning and a fluffy fibrous layer (A3) obtained in Example 15 by a method of step (2) in Example 19. With the above disordered fluffy membrane as a control group, and the double-layer fibrous membrane (hereinafter referred to as ordered fluffy membrane) in Example 19 as an experimental group, animal experiments are carried out to verify the effect of an ordered structure. A total of 12 healthy male or female New Zealand rabbits, weighing 2.0-2.5Kg, and aged about 6-12 months, are selected as experimental animals. The experimental rabbits are randomly divided into three groups, with four rabbits in each group. The membranes in the experimental group and the control group are all cut into 1cm x 4cm strips which are respectively implanted into abdomens of the rabbits subcutaneously, and tissue growth on the material surface is observed at two weeks and three months after surgery. An implantation method comprises the following steps: skin preparation and disinfection are carried out for each rabbit's abdomen, abdominal skin is incised along a midline, subcutaneous fascia and muscles are bluntly separated to expose an appropriate material implantation range. Three 1cm x 4cm samples of the experimental group are implanted into the left side of an interlayer between subcutaneous fascia, and three 1cm x 4cm samples of the control group are implanted into its right side. The material is fixed at a corresponding position by using lines No.4, and a subcutaneous fascia layer and a skin layer are sutured respectively. Two weeks later, fluffy surfaces of the experimental group and the control group are all wrapped with thin fibers, and implantation sites are rich in blood capillaries. A part of the material is taken out and dyed for observation, obvious cell growth and crawling orientation exist on the directional layer in the experimental group, while scattered cell growth exists on the non-directional layer in the control group. Three months later, a part of the two groups of samples are taken out for observation, obvious fibrous tissue directional texture exists on the directional fibrous layer in the experimental group, while no such directional texture exists on the non-directional fibrous layer in the control group. Thus it can be seen, the directional orientated fibrous layer (B) is more advantageous to guidance of cell crawling and tissue compliance growth, and repaired tissues are closer to natural fascia tissues. <Preparation of anti-adhesion tissue repair membrane: Examples 23-26> The fibrous membranes used for tissue repair prepared in Examples 1-3 are taken as fluffy fibrous layers (A' 1-3) of anti-adhesion tissue repair membranes.
