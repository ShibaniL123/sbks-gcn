Intermediate 14. 8-Bromo-9-but-2-ynyl-6-chloro-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole
8-Bromo-6-chloro-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (2.0 g, 7.1 mmol) in DMF (28 ml) was treated with cesium carbonate (5.79 g, 17.76 mmol) and 1-bromo-but-2-yne (0.95 g, 7.1 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. Reaction monitoring by LC/MS showed no conversion to the product. Two further additions of the 1-bromo-2-butyne compound, one equivalent each time, were made and the mixture was stirred over several days. The mixture was admixed with water (10 ml) and extracted with EA (3 x 50 ml). The combined organic phases were washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The product was purified by preparative RP HPLC. The fractions containing the product were pooled and concentrated, and the residue freeze-dried. 809 mg (25%) of the title compound was obtained in the form of its salt with trifluoroacetic acid.
