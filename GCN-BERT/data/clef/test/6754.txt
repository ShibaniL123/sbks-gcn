Comparative Example 2: Synthesis of racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.monosulfate
Ethanol solution (26.97 g) containing racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine (2.97 g: 23.5 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and 95% sulfuric acid (2.42 g: 23.4 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.monosulfate (4.31 g: 19.2 mmol, yield=82%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 271° C., 294° C.
