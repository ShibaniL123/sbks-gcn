BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0035] Fig. 1 depicts a Western blot of periplasmic extracts from modified host cells that produce bioconjugates. Strains as described in the Examples are indicated. "Int." refers to an integrated component. "*" refers to integration using a transposon-mediated approach. [0036] Fig. 2 depicts the repeat unit structure of the 06 O antigen of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. * indicates positions that can vary in their chemical composition according to subserotype identity. Variability is introduced by the activity of amidases that convert the acid functions of GalNAcA residues at C6 to amide, resulting in GalNAcAN (or GalNFmA to GalNFrnAN; an acetyl group substitutes C3 of the GalNAcAN* residue in some subserotypes). The genes for polymerization of the repeat unit (wzy), acetylation, formylation, and amidation of one of the GalNX residues are unknown. L-Rha, L-Rhamnose; D-GalNAcAN, 6-amido-2-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminuronic acid; D-GalNFmAN, 2-N-formyl- D-galactosaminuronic; D-QuiNAc, N-acetyl-D-quinosamine. [0037] Figure 3. Functional testing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 formyltransferase. 3A: Detection of formylated single 06 repeat unit bound to lipid A core by Western blotting. E. coli W3110 Awec was transformed with a cosmid encoding the (incomplete) rf 06 cluster and an expression plasmid encoding the 06 formyltransferase (fmt06; SEQ NO:2). Cell extracts were harvested after overnight induction during growth at 37°C in LB medium, digested with proteinase , separated by SDS PAGE, and electroblotted on nitrocellulose membranes. Immunodetection with an 06 specific antiserum induced a signal in the presence of fmt06, but not in the empty vector control. This result strongly indicates that formylation is a relelvant antigen on P. aeruginosa cells and a prerequisite for detection using this antiserum. 3B: Confirmation of formylation on a single 06 repeat unit released from undecaprenylpyrophosphate. E. coli W3110 Awec AwaaL was transformed with the same plamids as above and grown in shake flasks to produce 06 O antigen single repeat units (the wzy polymerase is missing in these strains) and glycolipids were analyzed. Briefly, repeat units were extracted as glycolipids from dried cells, purified by affinity to CI 8 cartridges, hydrolyzed (to remove undecaprenylpyrophosphate from the 06 O antigen repeat units), labelled with 2 aminobenzamide using reductive amination, and analyzed by normal phase HPLC. Coexpression of fmt06 gave rise to an additional signal at 61 ' elution time, containing oligosaccharides corresponding to the labelled, formylated 06 repeat unit, whereas in absence of the gene, the main signal was found at 58' and contained the labelled N acetylated 06 repeat unit. [0038] Figure 4. Functional testing of P. aeruginosa 06 candidate wzy polymerase. E. coli W3110 Awec cells containing a cosmid encoding the (incomplete) rfb cluster (lacking the fmt06 and wzy genes) was transformed with plasmids encoding the fmt06 and wzy candidate gene PAK_01823 (SEQ ID NO:3) or corresponding empty vectors. Cell extracts were treated with proteinase and LPS analyzed by immunodetection after SDS PAGE and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes. [0039] Figure 5. Cloning of the artificial Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 O antigen expression cluster. First, the rfb cluster of P. aeruginosa 06 strain stGVXN4017 {Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 "PAK" strain) was cloned into a cosmid vector by PCR cloning using standard techniques. Bioinformatics supported homology searches identified the formyltransferase (FT) and O-antigen polymerase (wzy), which were subsequently inserted downstream of the rfb cluster in a step wise manner. The resulting gene clusters are able to commit complete P. aeruginosa 06 O antigen repeat unit biosynthesis (rfb06+, no polymer) and polysaccharide (rfb06++, in which wzy is included) biosynthesis in E. coli W3110 derivatives.

In a specific embodiment, said nucleic acid encoding said oligosaccharyl transferase is integrated into the genome of the host cell. Genetic Background [0059] Exemplary host cells that can be used to generate the modified host cells described herein include, without limitation, Escherichia species, Shigella species, Klebsiella species, Xhantomonas species, Salmonella species, Yersinia species, Lactococcus species, Lactobacillus species, Pseudomonas species, Corynebacterium species, Streptomyces species, Streptococcus species, Staphylococcus species, Bacillus species, and Clostridium species. In a specific embodiment, the host cell used herein is E. coll. [0060] In certain embodiments, the host cell genetic background is modified by, e.g., deletion of one or more genes. Exemplary genes that can be deleted in host cells (and, in some cases, replaced with other desired nucleic acid sequences) include genes of host cells involved in glyco lipid biosynthesis, such as waaL (see, e.g., Feldman et al., 2005, PNAS USA 102:3016-3021) , the O antigen cluster (rfb or wb), enterobacterial common antigen cluster (wee), the lipid A core biosynthesis cluster (waa), , and prophage O antigen modification clusters like the gtrABS cluster. In a specific embodiment, the host cells described herein are modified such that they do not produce any O antigens other than a desired O antigen from, e.g., an O antigen Pseudomonas. In a specific embodiment, one or more of the waaL gene, gtrA gene, gtrB gene, gtrS gene, or a gene or genes from the wee cluster or a gene or genes from the rfb gene cluster are deleted or functionally inactivated from the genome of a prokaryotic host cell provided herein. In one embodiment, a host cell used herein is E. coli, wherein the waaL gene, gtrA gene, gtrB gene, gtrS gene are deleted or functionally inactivated from the genome of the host cell. In another embodiment, a host cell used herein is E. coli, wherein the waaL gene and gtrS gene are deleted or functionally inactivated from the genome of the host cell. In another embodiment, a host cell used herein is E. coli, wherein the waaL gene and genes from the wee cluster are deleted or functionally inactivated from the genome of the host cell. Carrier Proteins [0061] Any carrier protein suitable for use in the production of conjugate vaccines {e.g., bioconjugates for use in vaccines) can be used herein, e.g., nucleic acids encoding the carrier protein can be introduced into a host provided herein for the production of a bioconjugate comprising a carrier protein linked to Pseudomonas antigen. Exemplary carrier proteins include, without limitation, detoxified Exotoxin A of P. aeruginosa (EPA; see, e.g., Ihssen, et al., (2010) Microbial cell factories 9, 61), CRM 197, maltose binding protein (MBP), Diphtheria toxoid, Tetanus toxoid, detoxified hemolysin A of S. aureus, clumping factor A, clumping factor B, E. coli FimH, E. coli FimHC, E. coli heat labile enterotoxin, detoxified variants of E. coli heat labile enterotoxin, Cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), cholera toxin, detoxified variants of cholera toxin, E. coli Sat protein, the passenger domain of E. coli Sat protein, Streptococcus pneumoniae Pneumolysin and detoxified variants thereof, C. jejuni AcrA, Pseudomonas PcrV protein, and C. jejuni natural glycoproteins. [0062] In specific embodiments, the carrier proteins expressed by the modified host cells provided herein are expressed from a nucleic acid that has been integrated into the genome of the modified host cell. That is, a nucleic acid encoding the carrier protein has been integrated into the host cell genome. In certain embodiments, the carrier proteins expressed by the modified host cells provided herein are expressed from a plasmid that has been introduced into the modified host cell. [0063] In certain embodiments, the carrier proteins used in the generation of the bioconjugates described herein are modified, e.g., modified in such a way that the protein is less toxic and/or more susceptible to glycosylation. In a specific embodiment, the carrier proteins used in the generation of the bioconjugates described herein are modified such that the number of glycosylation sites in the carrier proteins is maximized in a manner that allows for lower concentrations of the protein to be administered, e.g., in an immunogenic composition, in its bioconjugate form. [0064] In certain embodiments, the carrier proteins described herein are modified to include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more glycosylation sites than would normally be associated with the carrier protein (e.g., relative to the number of glycosylation sites associated with the carrier protein in its native/natural, e.g., "wild-type" state). In specific embodiments, introduction of glycosylation sites is accomplished by insertion of glycosylation consensus sequences (e.g., Asn-X-Ser(Thr), wherein X can be any amino acid except Pro; or Asp(Glu)-X-Asn-Z-Ser(Thr), wherein X and Z are independently selected from any natural amino acid except Pro (see WO 2006/119987)) anywhere in the primary structure of the protein. Introduction of such glycosylation sites can be accomplished by, e.g., adding new amino acids to the primary structure of the protein (i.e., the glycosylation sites are added, in full or in part), or by mutating existing amino acids in the protein in order to generate the glycosylation sites (i.e., amino acids are not added to the protein, but selected amino acids of the protein are mutated so as to form glycosylation sites). Those of skill in the art will recognize that the amino acid sequence of a protein can be readily modified using approaches known in the art, e.g., recombinant approaches that include modification of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein. In specific embodiments, glycosylation consensus sequences are introduced into specific regions of the carrier protein, e.g., surface structures of the protein, at the N or C termini of the protein, and/or in loops that are stabilized by disulfide bridges at the base of the protein. In certain embodiments, the classical 5 amino acid glycosylation consensus sequence may be extended by lysine residues for more efficient glycosylation, and thus the inserted consensus sequence may encode 5, 6, or 7 amino acids that should be inserted or that replace acceptor protein amino acids. [0065] In certain embodiments, the carrier proteins used in the generation of the bioconjugates described herein comprise a "tag," i.e., a sequence of amino acids that allows for the isolation and/or identification of the carrier protein. For example, adding a tag to a carrier protein described herein can be useful in the purification of that protein and, hence, the purification of conjugate vaccines comprising the tagged carrier protein. Exemplary tags that can be used herein include, without limitation, histidine (HIS) tags (e.g., hexa histidine- tag, or 6XHis-Tag), FLAG-TAG, and HA tags. In certain embodiments, the tags used herein are removable, e.g., removal by chemical agents or by enzymatic means, once they are no longer needed, e.g., after the protein has been purified. [0066] In certain embodiments, the carrier proteins described herein comprise a signal sequence that targets the carrier protein to the periplasmic space of the host cell that expresses the carrier protein. In a specific embodiment, the signal sequence is from E. coli DsbA, E. coli outer membrane porin A (OmpA), E. coli maltose binding protein (MalE), Erwinia carotovorans pectate lyase (PelB), Flgl, NikA, or Bacillus sp. endoxylanase (XynA), heat labile E. coli enterotoxin LTIIb, Bacillus endoxylanase XynA, or E. coli flagellin (Flgl). Glycosylation Machinery Oligosaccharyl Transferases [0067] Oligosaccharyl transferases transfer lipid-lmked oligosaccharides to asparagine residues of nascent polypeptide chains that comprise an N-glycoxylation consensus motif, e.g., Asn-X-Ser(Thr), wherein X can be any amino acid except Pro; or Asp(Glu)-X-Asn-Z- Ser(Thr), wherein X and Z are independently selected from any natural amino acid except Pro (see WO 2006/119987). See, e.g., WO 2003/074687 and WO 2006/119987, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. [0068] In certain embodiments, the host cells provided herein comprise a nucleic acid that encodes an oligosaccharyl transferase. The nucleic acid that encodes an oligosaccharyl transferase can be native to the host cell, or can be introduced into the host cell using genetic approaches, as described above. The oligosaccharyl transferase can be from any source known in the art. In a specific embodiment, the oligosaccharyl transferase is an oligosaccharyl transferase from Campylobacter. In another specific embodiment, the oligosaccharyl transferase is an oligosaccharyl transferase from Campylobacter jejuni (i.e., pglB; see, e.g., Wacker et al, 2002, Science 298:1790-1793; see also, e.g., NCBI Gene ID: 3231775, UniProt Accession No. 086154). In another specific embodiment, the oligosaccharyl transferase is an oligosaccharyl transferase from Campylobacter lari (see, e.g., NCBI Gene ID: 7410986). [0069] In a specific embodiment, the modified host cells provided herein comprise a nucleic acid sequence encoding an oligosaccharyl transferase, wherein said nucleic acid sequence encoding an oligosaccharyl transferase is integrated into the genome of the host cell. Accessory Enzymes [0070] In certain embodiments, nucleic acids encoding one or more accessory enzymes are introduced into the modified host cells described herein. Such nucleic acids encoding one or more accessory enzymes can be either plasmid-borne or integrated into the genome of the host cells described herein. Exemplary accessory enzymes include, without limitation, epimerases, branching, modifying, amidating, chain length regulating, acetylating, formylating, polymerizing enzymes. [0071] Nucleic acid sequences encoding epimerases that can be inserted into the host cells described herein are known in the art. In certain embodiments, the epimerase inserted into a host cell described herein is an epimerase described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2011/062615, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In a specific embodiment, the epimerase is the epimerase encoded by the Z3206 gene of E. coli strain 0157. See, e.g., WO 2011/062615 and Rush et al., 2009, The Journal of Biological Chemistry 285:1671-1680, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In a specific embodiment, the modified host cells provided herein comprise a nucleic acid sequence encoding an epimerase, wherein said nucleic acid sequence encoding an epimerase is integrated into the genome of the host cell. [0072] In certain embodiments, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a formyltransferase is inserted into or expressed by the host cells described herein. Formyltransferases are enzymes that catalyse the transfer of a formyl group to an acceptor molecule. In a specific embodiment, a nucleic acid sequence encoding the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 formyltransferase fmt06 (SEQ ID NO:2), or a homo log thereof (e.g., the wzy polymerase from the PAK or LESB58 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa), is inserted into or expressed by the host cells described herein. In another specific embodiment, a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a protein having about or at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity or homology to SEQ ID NO:2 is inserted into or expressed by the host cells described herein. [0073] Certain formyltransferases involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis are known, and can be inserted into or expressed by the host cells described herein . For example, vioF is an enzyme from P. alcalifaciens serotype O30, which is 48% identical to the formyltransferase from Francisella tularensis (Nagaraja et al. 2005). It converts dTDP-D- Qui4N to dTDP-D-Qui4NFo, and is involved in O-antigen biosynthesis (Liu et al. 2012, Glycobiology 22(9): 1236-1244). Another formyltransferase involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis is arnA (e.g., from E. coli), a bifunctional enzyme in which the N-terminal domain converts UDP-Ara4N to UDP-AraNFo, while the C-terminal domain is involved in oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid. Both enzymatic activities are required for L-Ara4N modification of LipidA and polymyxin resistance (Breazeale et al., 2005, The Journal of Biological Chemistry 280(14): 14154-14167). Another formyltransferase involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis is wekD, an enzyme from i. coli serotype 0119, involved in the biosynthesis of TDP-DRhaNAc3NFo (Anderson et al, 1992, Carbohydr Res. 237:249- 62). [0074] Further, domains that are related to formyltransferase activity have been characterized. The so called FMT core domain is present in the majority of formyltransferases. Examples include the methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase, phosphoribosylglycmamide formyltransferase 1 , UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase/UDP-4- amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose formyltransferase, vioF from Providencia alcalifaciens O30, and arnA from E.coli. The above mentioned formyltransferases use FTHF (N-10- formyltetrahydrofolate) as formyl donor. Also, formate producing enzymes using FTHF (10- formyltetrahydrofolate) as substrate contain this domain. In addition, AICARFT is present in phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide formyltransferase/IMP cyclo hydrolase and FDH GDH is present in phosphoribosylglycmamide formyltransferase 2. [0075] In certain embodiments, a nucleic acid sequence encoding an O antigen polymerase (wzy gene) is inserted into or expressed by the host cells described herein. O antigen polymerases are multi spanning transmembrane proteins. They use undecaprenylpyrophosphate bound O antigen repeat units as substrates to generate a linear polymer constisting of the repeat units. O antigen polymerases (wzy) are present in Gram negative bacteria that synthesize O antigen polymers via a wzy dependent mechanism. [0076] In a specific embodiment, a nucleic acid sequence encoding the Pseudomonas aeruginosa wzy polymerase (SEQ ID NO:3), or a homolog thereof (e.g., the wzy polymerase from the PAK or LESB58 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa), is inserted into or expressed by the host cells described herein. Examples of bacteria known to comprise wzy polymerases include Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri and Salmonella typhimurium. In another specific embodiment, a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a protein having about or at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity or homology to SEQ ID NO: 3 is inserted into or expressed by the host cells described herein. Gene Copy Number [0077] In certain embodiments, the copy number of a gene(s) integrated into a modified host cell provided herein is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. In a specific embodiment, the copy number of a gene(s) integrated into a modified host cell provided herein is 1 or 2. Benefits [0078] The modified host cells described herein are of particular commercial importance and relevance, as they allow for large scale fermentation of bioconjugates comprising Pseudomonas antigens that can be used as therapeutics (e.g., in immunogenic compositions, vaccines), at a lower risk due to the increased stability of the chromosomally inserted DNA and thus expression of the DNA of interest during fermentation. The modified host cells described herein are advantageous over host cells that rely on plasmid borne expression of nucleic acids required for generation of the bioconjugates described herein because, inter alia, antibiotic selection during fermentation is not required once the heterologous DNA is inserted into the host cell genome. That is, when the insert DNA is inserted in the chromosome, it doesn't need to be selected for, because it is propagated along with replication of the host genome. Further, it is a known disadvantage in plasmid borne systems that with every generation (i.e., cycle of host cell replication) the risk for losing the plasmid increases. This loss of plasmid is due to the sometimes inappropriate distribution of plasmids to daughter cells at the stage of cell separation during cell division. At large scale, bacterial cell cultures duplicate more often than in smaller fermentation scales to reach high cell densities. Thus, higher cell stability and insert DNA expression leads to higher product yields, providing a distinct advantage. Cell stability is furthermore a process acceptance criteria for approval by regulatory authorities, while antibiotic selection is generally not desired during fermentation for various reasons, e.g., antibiotics present as impurities in the final medicial products and bear the risk of causing allergic reactions, and antibiotics may promote antibiotic resistance (e.g., by gene transfer or selection of resistant pathogens). [0079] The present application provides modified host cells for use in making bioconjugates comprising Pseudomonas antigens that can be used as therapeutics (e.g., in immunogenic compositions, vaccines), wherein certain genetic elements required to drive the production of bioconjugates are integrated stably into the host cell genome. Consequently the host cell can contain a reduced number of plasmids, just a single plasmid or no plasmids at all. In some embodiments, the presence of a single plasmid can result in greater flexibility of the production strain and the ability to change the nature of the conjugation ( in terms of its saccharide or carrier protein content) easily leading to greater flexibility of the production strain. [0080] In general, a reduction in the use of plasmids leads to a production strain which is more suited for use in the production of medicinal products. A drawback of essential genetic material being present on plasmids is the requirement for selection pressure to maintain the episomal elements in the host cell. The selection pressure requires the use of antibiotics, which is undesirable for the production of medicinal products due to, e.g., the danger of allergic reactions against the antibiotics and the additional costs of manufacturing. Furthermore, selection pressure is often not complete, resulting in inhomogeneous bacterial cultures in which some clones have lost the plasmid and thus are not producing the bioconjugate. The host cells described herein therefore are able to produce a safer product that can be obtained in high yields. 5.2 Methods of Integration/Introduction of Nucleic Acids into Host Cells [0081] Any method known in the art can be used to integrate a nucleic acid (e.g., a gene or an operon, e.g., rfb cluster) into the genome of a host cell. [0082] In a specific embodiment, heterologous nucleic acids are introduced into the host cells described herein using the method of insertion described in International Patent application No. PCT/EP2013/071328. According to this method, large contiguous sequences of DNA can be stably inserted directly into a host cell genome. Briefly, the method comprises some or all of following steps: [0083] Step 1 : A donor plasmid is made. A desired heterologous insert DNA sequence (i.e., a heterologous insert DNA sequence that comprises one or more genes of interest) is cloned into a cloning site (e.g., a multiple cloning site, abbreviated as MCS) of a plasmid suitable for use as a donor plasmid. DNA sequences suitable for use as homology regions (i.e., DNA sequences homologous to the insertion location on the host cell genome) also are cloned into the donor plasmid, such that the homology regions flank the heterologous insert DNA. These methods of cloning and assembly of the donor plasmid can be done according to any established and well known technology to modify and synthesize DNA such as, without limitation, molecular cloning using restriction enzymes and ligase, transposases, chemical synthesis, etc. which technologies are known to those of skill in the art. [0084] In certain embodiments, a selection cassette comprising an open reading frame encoding a protein that confers antibiotic resistance is positioned in between the homology arms. Host cells comprising the heterologous insert DNA inserted into their genome can be identified by culturing them on media that comprises the antibiotic to which the antibiotic resistance gene of the selection cassette provides resistance. In certain embodiments, the selection cassette may be flanked by FRT sites, which allow for later removal of the cassette by site directed recombination. Incorporating FRT sites in this manner into the donor plasmid thus ensures that the selection cassette does not remain integrated in the host cell genome. In another embodiment, the selection cassette can be removed following integration via dif site mediated site directed homologous recombination or by other, site directed chromosomal mutagenesis technologies. [0085] The donor plasmids further can be engineered to comprise an open reading frame encoding a counterselection protein. Any gene encoding a protein known to those of skill in the art suitable for use in counterselection approaches can be incorporated into the donor plasmids described herein. In a specific embodiment, the sacB gene is used for counterselection. [0086] The donor plasmids further can be engineered to comprise an origin of replication. Those of skill in the art will readily appreciate that the origin of replication incorporated into the donor plasmid should be suitable for use in the host cell that is undergoing genome modification. For example, an E. coli replication origin must be present when cloning is being performed in E. coli. In a specific embodiment, the origin of replication is oriT. Those of skill in the art will readily appreciate that shuttle plasmids (i.e., plasmids capable of replication in multiple host cells, e.g., multiple bacterial species) can be generated using methods known in the art, and such plasmids could be used for insertion into numerous types of host cells, e.g., prokaryotic cells, archeal cells, eubacterial cells, or eukaryotic cells. Such shuttle plasmids may comprise organism specific expression control elements and replication origins. [0087] Step 2: A helper plasmid is made. The helper plasmid is engineered to encode all necessary activities for mediating DNA insertion into host cells and for maintenance of the helper plasmid within the host cells that undergo recombination. In certain embodiments, the helper plasmids comprise (i) a selection cassette for plasmid maintenance in the host cell, (ii) a regulon for the expression of a recombinase, i.e. an enzyme or enzymes that support and enhance the crossing over efficiency between homologous DNA stretches, (iii) a regulon for expression of a function that linearizes the DNA insert resulting in terminal homologous sequences which can undergo homologous recombination, (iv) a regulon expressing a RecA homo log for host cells that do not have an own recA copy and (v) a conditional origin of replication. [0088] In certain embodiments, the helper plasmids comprise components similar to the helper plasmid pTKRED (Gene bank GU327533.1). In a specific embodiment, the helper plasmid pTKRED (Gene bank GU327533.1) is used in the method. [0089] Step 3 : The donor plasmid and the helper plasmid are introduced into the same host cell. Insertion of donor and helper plasmids can be performed by many different technologies known to those of skill in the art including, without limitation, electroporation, use of chemically competent cells, heat shock, and phage transduction. The host cells can then be cultured under selective conditions to enrich for cells carrying the introduced plasmids. [0090] Step 4: The insertion procedure is initiated. An exemplary insertion procedure comprises the following steps: overnight cultures of positive clones (i.e. host cells comprising both the helper and donor plasmids) can be grown at, e.g., 30°C in media comprising the proper antibiotics for selection (such antibiotics can readily be selected by those of skill in the art based on the selection cassettes present in the donor/helper plasmids). The cultures then can be diluted and grown at, e.g., 30°C until exponential phase in the presence of appropriate antibiotics. Under these conditions, the helper and donor plasmids are maintained but silent. Next, the media is replaced by media containing the antibiotics for selection, as well as any inducers of conditional elements (e.g., inducible promoters or conditional origins of replication) present in the plasmids, followed by further incubation of the cells. During this time, the restriction endonuclease (e.g., Seel) in the helper plasmid and the recombinase (e.g., lambda red recombinase) in the helper plasmid are expressed, leading to cleavage of the donor plasmid at the homology arms, and homologous recombination of the homology DNA at the homologous sites in the genome of the host cell. Next, the cells are plated on medium containing the component that the counterselection marker of the donor plasmid corresponds to (e.g., sucrose if the counterselection marker is sacB). This step results in counterselection of cells that comprise the donor plasmid, i.e., cells that the donor plasmid exists in an uninserted state. Such medium also comprises the resistance marker present in the insertion cassette of the donor plasmid (i.e., the antibiotic resistance cassette that is present between the HR of the donor plasmid, to select for cells that contain the heterologous insert DNA. After overnight incubation, the cells are then screened for recombined clones showing an antibiotic resistance phenotype consistent with (i) loss of the helper and donor plasmids and (ii) presence of the heterologous DNA insert. [0091] In addition to the insertion methods described above, DNA can be inserted into the genome of a host cell using other approaches. In certain embodiments, DNA is inserted into the genome of a host cell using any site-specific insertion method known in the art. In certain embodiments, DNA is inserted into the genome of a host cell using any random integration method known in the art. Such methods are described in greater detail below. [0092] In certain embodiments, DNA is inserted into a host cell (e.g., E. coli) genome using a method that comprises transposon-mediated insertion. Such random insertion allows for insertion of DNA of interest at multiple locations of the host cell genome, and thus allows for the identification of optimal insertion sites in host cells into which DNA has been inserted, e.g., host cells bearing inserted DNA can be compared with one another with regard to efficiency of production of the inserted DNA and host cells with highest efficiency can be selected for future use. Methods of transposon-mediated insertion of nucleic acid sequences into host cell genomes are known in the art. For example, in certain embodiments, the pUTminiTn5 delivery system (Biomedical; Sevilla, Spain) is used to stably inserted genes into the genomes of host cells (such as bacterial host cells). Strains into which DNA has been inserted then can be identified and isolated. See also Herrero et al., 1990, J. Bacteriology 172(11):6557-6567 and DeLorenzo et al., 1990, J. Bacteriology 172(11):6568-6572, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In addition, in certain embodiments, transposon-mediated insertion of DNA into a host cell genome is accomplished using a Tn-7 based method of DNA insertion. See McKenzie et al., 2006, BMC Microbiology 6:39 and Sibley et al., 2012, Nucleic Acids Res. 40:el9, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

[0094] In certain embodiments, DNA is inserted into a host cell (e.g., E. coli) genome using the "clonetegration" method of cloning and chromosomal integration of DNA. See St. Pierre et al, 2013, ACS Synthetic Biology 2:537-541 , the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. [0095] In certain embodiments, DNA is inserted into a host cell (e.g., E. coli) genome using a method that involves conditional-replication, integration, and modular (CRIM) plasmids, as described by Haldimann and Wanner, 2001, J. Bacteriology 183:6384-6393, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. [0096] In certain embodiments, DNA is inserted into a host cell (e.g., E. coli) genome using recombineering, a method described by, for example, Sharan et al, 2009, Nat. Protoc. 4:206-223; Yu et al., 2000, PNAS USA 97:5978-5983; Kuhlman et al, 2010, Nucleic Acids Res. 38:e92; and Zhang et al., 1998, Nat. Genet. 20:123-128, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. [0097] In certain embodiments, heterologous nucleic acids are introduced into the modified host cells described herein by electroporation, chemical transformation by heat shock, natural transformation, phage transduction, and/or conjugation. In specific embodiments, heterologous nucleic acids are introduced into the host cells described herein using a plasmid, e.g., the heterologous nucleic acids are expressed in the host cells by a plasmid (e.g., an expression vector), and the plasmid is introduced into the modified host cells by electroporation, chemical transformation by heat shock, natural transformation, phage transduction, or conjugation. [0098] In a specific embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid sequence is integrated into a host cell (e.g., E. coli), wherein said nucleic acid encodes a modified Pseudomonas rfb cluster, e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 rfb cluster, wherein said modified Pseudomonas rfl> cluster comprises (i) a gene encoding a formyltransferase (e.g., a gene encoding SEQ ID NO:2 or a homolog thereof), (ii) a gene encoding a wzy polymerase (e.g., a gene encoding SEQ ID N03 or a homolog thereof); or (iii) a gene encoding a formyltransferase (e.g., a gene encoding SEQ ID NO:2 or a homolog thereof) and a gene encoding a wzy polymerase (e.g., a gene encoding SEQ ID N03 or a homolog thereof). 5.3 Bioconjugates [0099] The modified host cells described herein can be used to produce bioconjugates comprising a Pseudomonas antigen linked to a carrier protein. Methods of producing bioconjugates using host cells are known in the art. See, e.g., WO 2003/074687 and WO 2006/119987. Bioconjugates, as described herein, have advantageous properties over chemical conjugates of antigen-carrier protein, in that they require less chemicals in manufacture and are more consistent in terms of the final product generated. [00100] In a specific embodiment, provided herein is a bio conjugate comprising a carrier protein linked to a Pseudomonas antigen. In a specific embodiment, said Pseudomonas antigen is an O antigen of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a specific embodiment, provided herein is a bioconjugate comprising a P. aeruginosa O antigen and a carrier protein, wherein said carrier protein is EPA, PcrV (aka LcrV,EspA, SseB), PopB (YopB, YopD, FliC), or OprF, Oprl. [00101] In a specific embodiment, provided herein is a bioconjugate comprising a carrier protein linked to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa O antigen, wherein said Pseudomonas aeruginosa O antigen is an O antigen from Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, O10, Oi l, 012, 013, 014, 015, 016, 017, 018, 019, or 020. [00102] In a specific embodiment, provided herein is a bioconjugate comprising a carrier protein linked to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa O antigen, wherein said Pseudomonas aeruginosa O antigen is one of the serotypes described in Knirel et al., 2006, Journal of Endotoxin Research 12(6):324-336, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

See, e.g., Saraswat et al., 2013, Biomed. Res. Int. ID#312709 (p. 1-18); see also the methods described in WO 2009/104074. Further, the bioconjugates may be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art to facilitate purification. The actual conditions used to purify a particular bioconjugate will depend, in part, on the synthesis strategy and on factors such as net charge, hydrophobicity, and/or hydrophilicity of the bioconjugate, and will be apparent to those having skill in the art. 5.4 Analytical Methods [00106] Various methods can be used to analyze the structural compositions and sugar chain lengths of the bio conjugates described herein. [00107] In one embodiment, hydrazino lysis can be used to analyze glycans. First, polysaccharides are released from their protein carriers by incubation with hydrazine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ludger Liberate Hydrazinolysis Glycan Release Kit, Oxfordshire, UK). The nucleophile hydrazine attacks the glycosidic bond between the polysaccharide and the carrier protein and allows release of the attached glycans. N-acetyl groups are lost during this treatment and have to be reconstituted by re-N-acetylation. The free glycans are purified on carbon columns and subsequently labeled at the reducing end with the fluorophor 2-amino benzamide. See Bigge JC, Patel TP, Bruce JA, Goulding PN, Charles SM, Parekh RB: Nonselective and efficient fluorescent labeling of glycans using 2- amino benzamide and anthranilic acid. Anal Biochem 1995, 230(2):229-238. The labeled polysaccharides are separated on a GlycoSep-N column (GL Sciences) according to the HPLC protocol of Royle et al . See Royle L, Mattu TS, Hart E, Langridge JI, Merry AH, Murphy N, Harvey DJ, Dwek RA, Rudd PM: An analytical and structural database provides a strategy for sequencing O-glycans from microgram quantities of glycoproteins. Anal Biochem 2002, 304(l):70-90. The resulting fluorescence chromatogram indicates the polysaccharide length and number of repeating units. Structural information can be gathered by collecting individual peaks and subsequently performing MS/MS analysis. Thereby the monosaccharide composition and sequence of the repeating unit could be confirmed and additionally in homogeneity of the polysaccharide composition could be identified. [00108] In another embodiment, SDS-PAGE or capillary gel electrophoresis can be used to assess glycans and bioconjugates. Polymer length for the O antigen glycans is defined by the number of repeat units that are linearly assembled. This means that the typical ladder like pattern is a consequence of different repeat unit numbers that compose the glycan. Thus, two bands next to each other in SDS PAGE or other techniques that separate by size differ by only a single repeat unit. These discrete differences are exploited when analyzing glycoproteins for glycan size: The unglycosylated carrier protein and the bioconjugate with different polymer chain lengths separate according to their electrophoretic mobilities. The first detectable repeating unit number (¾) and the average repeating unit number (i rage) present on a bioconjugate are measured. These parameters can be used to demonstrate batch to batch consistency or polysaccharide stability. [00109] In another embodiment, high mass MS and size exclusion HPLC could be applied to measure the size of the complete bioconjugates. [00110] In another embodiment, an anthrone-sulfuric acid assay can be used to measure polysaccharide yields. See Leyva A, Quintana A, Sanchez M, Rodriguez EN, Cremata J, Sanchez JC: Rapid and sensitive anthrone-sulfuric acid assay in microplate format to quantify carbohydrate in biopharmaceutical products: method development and validation. Biologicals : journal of the International Association of Biological Standardization 2008, 36(2):134-141. In another embodiment, a Methylpentose assay can be used to measure polysaccharide yields. See, e.g., Dische et al., J Biol Chem. 1948 Sep;175(2):595-603. Change in glycosylation site usage [00111] To show that the site usage in a specific protein is changed in a multiple plasmid system as opposed to an inserted system, the glycosylation site usage must be quantified. Methods to do so are listed below. [00112] Glycopeptide LC-MS/MS: bioconjugates are digested with protease(s), and the peptides are separated by a suitable chromatographic method (CI 8, Hydriphilic interaction HPLC HILIC, GlycoSepN columns, SE HPLC, AE HPLC), and the different peptides are identified using MS/MS. This method can be used with our without previous sugar chain shortening by chemical (smith degradation) or enzymatic methods. Quantification of glycopeptide peaks using UV detection at 215 to 280 nm allow relative determination of glycosylation site usage. [00113] Size exclusion HPLC: Higher glycosylation site usage is reflected by a earlier elution time from a SE HPLC column. Homogeneity [00114] Bioconjugate homogeneity (i.e., the homogeneity of the attached sugar residues) can be assessed using methods that measure glycan length and hydrodynamic radius. Other Potential Clinical/Practical Applications [00115] Integrated strains can make a higher yield of bioconjugates due to the reduced antibiotic selection burden as compared to the three plasmid system. In addition, less proteolytic degradation occurs due to reduced metabolic burden to the cells. [00116] Integrated strains make bioconjugates with shorter, less spread polysaccharide length distributions. Thus, the bioconjugates are easier to characterize and are better defined. In addition, insertion may reduce the extent of periplasmic stress to the cells which may lead to less proteolysis of product during the fermentation process due to the reduced antibiotic selection burden as compared to the three plasmid system. [00117] Protein glycosylation systems require three recombinant elements in the production host: a carrier protein expression DNA, an oligosaccharyl transferase expression DNA, and a polysaccharide expression DNA. Prior art bacterial production systems contain these three elements on plasmids. Thus, there is a risk for instability during manufacture due to plasmid loss, particularly because antibiotics used for maintenance of the plasmids mustn't be present during fermentation of GMP material. Since inserted strains contain one plasmid less, they are more stable over many generations. This means that higher scale fermentations and longer incubation times (higher generation numbers) are more feasible. In addition, the absence of an antibiotic for selection makes a safer product, due to the absence of trace antibiotics which can cause allergic reactions in sensitive subjects. See COMMITTEE WE, BIOLOGICAL O, STANDARDIZATION: WHO Technical Report Series 941. In: Fifty- sixth Report. Edited by Organization WH. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2007. [00118] Inserted strains are more genetically stable due to the fixed chromosomal insertion, thus leading to higher reproducibility of desired protein products during the production process, e.g., during culture of host cell comprising inserted heterologous DNA. Analytical Methods for Testing Benefit [00119] Yield. Yield is measured as carbohydrate amount derived from a liter of bacterial production culture grown in a bioreactor under controlled and optimized conditions. After purification of bioconjugate, the carbohydrate yields can be directly measured by either the anthrone assay or ELISA using carbohydrate specific antisera. Indirect measurements are possible by using the protein amount (measured by well known BCA, Lowry, or bardford assays) and the glycan length and structure to calculate a theoretical carbohydrate amount per gram of protein. In addition, yield can also be measured by drying the glycoprotein preparation from a volatile buffer and using a balance to measure the weight. [00120] Homogeneity. Homogeneity means the variability of glycan length and possibly the number of glycosylation sites. Methods listed above can be used for this purpose. SE- HPLC allows the measurement of the hydrodynamic radius. Higher numbers of glycosylation sites in the carrier lead to higher variation in hydrodynamic radius compared to a carrier with less glycosylation sites. However, when single glycan chains are analyzed, they may be more homogenous due to the more controlled length. Glycan length is measured by hydrazino lysis, SDS PAGE, and CGE. In addition, homogeneity can also mean that certain glycosylation site usage patterns change to a broader/narrower range. These factors can be measured by Glycopeptide LC-MS/MS. [00121] Strain stability and reproducibility. Strain stability during bacterial fermentation in absence of selective pressure is measured by direct and indirect methods that confirm presence or absence of the recombinant DNA in production culture cells. Culture volume influence can be simulated by elongated culturing times meaning increased generation times. The more generations in fermentation, the more it is likely that a recombinant element is lost. Loss of a recombinant element is considered instability. Indirect methods rely on the association of selection cassettes with recombinant DNA, e.g. the antibiotic resistance cassettes in a plasmid. Production culture cells are plated on selective media, e.g. LB plates supplemented with antibiotics or other chemicals related to a selection system, and resistant colonies are considered as positive for the recombinant DNA associated to the respective selection chemical. In the case of a multiple plasmid system, resistant colonies to multiple antibiotics are counted and the proportion of cells containing all three resistances is considered the stable population. Alternatively, quantitative PCR can be used to measure the amount of recombinant DNA of the three recombinant elements in the presence, absence of selection, and at different time points of fermentation. Thus, the relative and absolute amount of recombinant DNA is measured and compared. Reproducibility of the production process is measured by the complete analysis of consistency batches by the methods stated in this application. 5.5 Compositions Compositions Comprising Host Cells [00122] In one aspect, provided herein are compositions comprising the host cells described herein (see Section 5.1).

In some embodiments, the ability of a bioconjugate to generate an immune response in a subject can be assessed by immunizing a subject (e.g., a mouse) or set of subjects with a bioconjugate described herein and immunizing an additional subject (e.g., a mouse) or set of subjects with a control (PBS). The subjects or set of subjects can subsequently be challenged with Pseudomonas and the ability of the Pseudomonas to cause disease in the subjects or set of subjects can be determined. Those skilled in the art will recognize that if the subject or set of subjects immunized with the control suffer(s) from disease subsequent to challenge with the Pseudomonas but the subject or set of subjects immunized with a bioconjugate(s) or composition thereof described herein suffers less from or do not suffer from disease, then the bioconjugate is able to generate an immune response in a subject.

In Vitro Bactericidal Assays [00149] The ability of the bioconjugates described herein to generate an immune response in a subject can be assessed using a serum bactericidal assay (SBA) or opsonophagocytotic killing assay (OPK), which represents an established and accepted method that has been used to obtain approval of glycoconjugate-based vaccines. Such assays are well-known in the art and, briefly, comprise the steps of generating and isolating antibodies against a target of interest (e.g., an antigen of Pseudomonas) by administering to a subject (e.g., a mouse) a compound that elicits such antibodies. Subsequently, the bactericidal capacity of the antibodies can be assessed by, e.g., culturing the bacteria in question in the presence of said antibodies and complement and - depending on the assay - neutrophilic cells and assaying the ability of the antibodies to kill and/or neutralize the bacteria, e.g., using standard microbiological approaches. 6. EXAMPLES Example 1: Bacterial Strains with an Inserted Oligosaccharyl Transferase and an Inserted rfb Cluster Are Stable and Produce Bioconjugates [00150] This example demonstrates that bioconjugates can successfully be produced by a bacterial host strain that has been genetically modified by insertion of (i) a nucleic acid encoding an oligosaccharyl transferase and (ii) a nucleic acid encoding an rfb cluster. [00151] Modified E. coli host cells were generated by inserting the following directly into the host cell genome: (i) a nucleic acid encoding the C. jejuni oligosaccharyl transferase (PglB) and (ii) a nucleic acid encoding the rfb cluster from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA 103. This rfb cluster encodes genes necessary for O-antigen synthesis of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa serogroup Oi l antigen. The insertions were performed using the novel insertion method described in PCT/EP2013/071328 (see Section 5.2, above) or the pUT mini system (Biomedal Lifescience). The insertion method described in PCT/EP2013/071328 is site-specific and utilizes homologous recombination, whereas the pUT mini system is a random, transposon-mediated approach that results in a nucleic acid sequence of interest being randomly inserted into a host cell genome. The E. coli host cells further were modified by introduction of a plasmid that expresses detoxified Pseudomonas extotoxin A (EPA) as a carrier protein into the host cells. Thus, the modified E. coli host cells described in this example express (i) the C. jejuni oligosaccharyl transferase (PglB), by virtue of integration of a nucleic acid encoding the oligosaccharyl transferase into the host cell genome; (ii) genes of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa rfb cluster that produce the 011 antigen, by virtue of integration of a nucleic acid encoding the rfb cluster from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA103 into the host cell genome; and (iii) the EPA carrier protein, by virtue of transforming the host cell with a plasmid comprising a nucleic acid encoding the carrier protein. [00152] Additional modified E. coli host cells were generated to allow for comparison of the ability of the modified host cells comprising double integrations (integration of an oligosaccharyl transferase and integration of an rfb cluster) to produce bioconjugates (EPA- 011) with bioconjugate production by host cells having (i) only a single integration of the oligosaccharyl transferase or the rfb cluster and the remaining components (carrier protein and oligosaccharyl transferase or rfb cluster) plasmid expressed by the host cell; or (ii) no integrated components, with all components (carrier protein and oligosaccharyl transferase and rfb cluster) plasmid expressed. [00153] Three different E. coli background strains were used in the analysis: (i) "St4167" (W31 10 AwaaL, Arfb016: :rfbP.a.011), which comprises a deletion of the E. coli waaL gene, a deletion of the E. coli 016 rfb cluster, and an insertion of the P. aeruginosa 011 rfb cluster (PCT/EP2013/071328); (ii) "Stl 128" (W31 10 AwaaL), which comprises a deletion of the E. coli waaL gene; and (iii) "Stl935" (W3110 AwaaL, AwzzE-wecG, AwbbUK), which comprises deletion of the indicated genes. For insertion of the P. aeruginosa Oi l rfb cluster in St4167, 011 rfb cluster was cloned into the pDOC plasmid and the method according to PCT/EP2013/071328 was employed. The St4167 strains represent the double integration strains. [00154] The specific plasmids utilized to introduce EPA into the host cell strains are designated "pl077" and "pl50." The latter is described in Ihssen, et al., (2010) Microbial cell factories 9, 61 , and the plasmids are the same with the exception of the fact that pi 077 replaces the Amp cassette of pi 50 with a Kan cassette. [00155] The following St4167 variants were generated: (i) St4167 with pglB inserted in place of the host cell yahL gene (by the method of PCT/EP2013/071328) and EPA expressed by plasmid i 077; (ii) St4167 with pglB inserted in place of the host cell ompT gene (using the pUT mini system) and EPA expressed by plasmid pi 50; (iii) St4167 with pglB expressed by plasmid pi 769 (pglB in pDOC) and EPA expressed by plasmid pi 077; (iv) St4167 with pglB expressed by plasmid p939 (pEXT21 based expression plasmid for PglB with an HA tag, codon optimized) and EPA expressed by plasmid pi 077; and (v) St4167 with pglB expressed by plasmid pi 762 (pglB in pDOC) and EPA expressed by plasmid pi 077. [00156] The following Stl 128 variants were generated: (i) Stl 128 with pglB expressed by plasmid p939, P. aeruginosa Oi l rfb cluster expressed by plasmid pi 64 (pLAFR plasmid engineered to contain the P. aeruginosa Oi l rfb cluster), and EPA expressed by plasmid pi 077; and (ii) Stl 128 with pglB inserted in place of the host cell yahL gene (by the method of PCT/EP2013/071328), P. aeruginosa 011 rfb cluster expressed by plasmid pl64, and EPA expressed by plasmid pi 077. [00157] The following Stl935 variants were generated: (i) Stl935 with pglB inserted in place of the host cell ompT gene (by the method of PCT/EP2013/071328), P. aeruginosa Oi l rfb cluster expressed by plasmid i 64, and EPA expressed by plasmid pi 077; (ii) Stl935 with pglB inserted in place of the host cell yahL gene (by the method of PCT/EP2013/071328), P. aeruginosa 011 rfb cluster expressed by plasmid pi 64, and EPA expressed by plasmid pl077; and Stl935 with pglB expressed by plasmid p939, P. aeruginosa Oi l rfb cluster expressed by plasmid i 64, and EPA expressed by plasmid pl077. [00158] As shown in Figure I, all strains expressing an oligosaccharyl transferase, carrier protein, and an rfb cluster produced bioconjugates. See the blots depicted between kDa markers 100 and 130, which correspond to EPA-Ol 1. Importantly, this observation includes strains comprising double integration of an oligosaccharyl transferase and an rfb cluster. See, in particular, the results shown for St4167. Thus, this Example demonstrates not only that stable host cells can be generated following double insertion of genes/gene clusters into the host cell genome, but that function of the genes is maintained. Specifically, function of the inserted oligosaccharyl transferase and inserted rfb cluster was preserved, resulting in the production of bioconjugates. Example 2: Identification of a formyltransferase gene that contributes to the synthesis of a native P. aeruginosa 06 O-antigen oligo/polysaccharide [00159] This example describes the identification of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 formyltransferase. [00160] Proteome data for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 strain "LESB58," the genome of which is known, was searched for domains containing homology to the prototype query domains "Formyltransferase" and "FMT C-terminal domain-like" domain using the algorithm provided at www.supfam.org/SUPEPvFAMILY/. The search identified 9 protein sequences with possible related domains. [00161] To evaluate whether any of the 9 candidates identified were specific for 06 (and thereby for a formylated O antigen repreat unit) their absence in the proteome of another Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype (05, strain PAOl) was analyzed using a BLAST search (NCBI website). The Pseudomonas aeruginosa 05 O-antigen structure is unrelated that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06. Specifically, no formyl group is present in the 05 structure. 8 out of 9 candidates had homologues in Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 05 which indicated that these proteins were unspecific for Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 strain LESB58. The remaining candidate (locus_tag=PLES_ 12061, GenBank: CAW25933.1; SEQ ID NO:2) had no obvious homologue in Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 05 and was therefore classified as specific for LESB58/Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06. [00162] To confirm 06 specificity, the presence of the discovered Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 formyltransferase (SEQ ID NO:2) in other Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 strains was verified. Proteins equivalent to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 formyltransferase (SEQ ID NO:2) were identified in four other Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 strains, including locus tag: PAK 01412 in strain "PAK" and locus tag: PAM18_1171 in strain M18. [00163] Formyltransferases with low amino acid sequence identity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 formyltransferase (SEQ ID NO:2) also were identified in Methylobacterium sp. (33% identity, ACCESSION WP_020093860), Thiothrix nivea (30% identity, ACCESSION WP_002707142), Anaerophaga thermohalophila (28% identity, ACCESSION WP_010422313), Halorubrum californiense (27% identity, ACCESSION WP 008445073), Azorhizobium caulinodans (25% identity, ACCESSION WP 012170036) and Burkholderia glathei (24% identity, ACCESSION KDR39707). Taken together, these homology analyses indicated that the related genes encode an 06 specific activity related to formylation. [00164] To test the functional activity of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 formyltransferase (SEQ ID N0:2) on the non formylated 06 repeat unit structure, the gene encoding SEQ ID NO:2 was cloned. The rare TTG START codon of the gene was replaced by ATG. A schematic representation of the cloning of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 formyltransferase (SEQ ID NO:2) into the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 rfb cluster and the relative organization of the genes is depicted in Figure 5. [00165] Once identified, function of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 formyltransferase was assessed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 formyltransferase (SEQ ID NO:2) was tested for functionality by co-expression with the rfb cluster genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 in E. coli strains that lack a functional ECA (wee) cluster. To show formylation, single antigen repeat units bound to lipid a core were analyzed (in a waaL positive strain). The formylated 06 O-antigen repeating unit was identified by immunodetection using an 06 specific antibody (Figure 3A) indicating that the formyl group is a relevant epitope of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 O antigen structure. [00166] To show formylation on the molecular level, 06 repeat units were analyzed by MALDI MSMS. Purified and 2AB labelled repeat units showed that coexpression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 formyltransferase (SEQ ID NO:2) with the rfb cluster genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 gave rise to a fluorescence signal of the main peak which was shifted by 2-3 minutes (from 58 to 61 ', Fig. 3B). [00167] MALDI-MSMS analysis of the material contained in the peaks at 58' resulted in a Y ion fragmentation series which is in agreement with the non formylated, N acetylated 2-AB labelled 06 repeat unit. The protonated precursor ion m/z=905, fragmented into a prominent ion series of 905->759->543->326, corresponding to losses of 146 (deoxyhexose), 216 (amidated N-acetylhexosaminuronic acid), 217 (N-acetylhexosaminuronic acid ) units. Material collected at 61 ' obtained from cells expressing the Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 formyltransferase gene contained a prominent precursor ion of 891, which fragmented at 891->745->529->326, corresponding to losses of 146 (as above), 216 (as above), and 203 (amidated N-formylhexosaminuronic acid). This data proved that formylation is dependent on the expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 formyltransferase and that accordingly the gene is encoding the formyltransferase. Thus, the gene that encodes the Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 formyltransferase was named fmt06. The fact that the acetyl group of the amidated N-acetylhexosaminuronic acid is replaced by a formyl group suggests a two step mechanism wherein the acetyl group is first removed before the formyl group can be added. This model implies that a free amine group would be present at C2 as an intermediate before the formyltransferase domain attaches a formyl group to the monosaccharide. Thus, deacetylated and non formylated O antigen may be a substantial and immunologically relevant, substochiometrically present polysaccharide form of P. aeruginosa serotype 06. Example 3: Identification and testing of the wzy gene for polymerization of the P. aeruginosa 06 O antigen. [00168] This example describes the identification of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 wzy polymerase. [00169] O antigen polysaccharides constitute the outer cell surface of many Gram negative bacteria. The enzymatic machinery responsible for the biosynthesis of O antigen is often encoded in a single gene cluster called the rfb cluster. Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 strains express a polymeric O-antigen (Figure 2). However, in the respective O-antigen cluster, a gene encoding an O antigen polymerase (wzy) is absent. This means that in order to recombinant ly express the P. aeruginosa 06 O antigen in E. coli, identification of the wzy gene was necessary. O-antigen polymerases (wzy) are integral inner membrane proteins that catalyze the polymerization of O-antigen repeating units in the periplasmic space before "en bloc" ligation to the lipid A-core Oligosaccharide to form LPS. Wzy polymerases are highly specific for their repeat unit oligomer and homologies among wzy genes are poor. [00170] The O-antigen of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 019 shares structural similarities to that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06. It was speculated that the wzy proteins that recognize both structures might also share similar properties, e.g., structure, sequence, number of transmembrane domains. The sequence of the 019 Wzy protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 019 (ACCESSION AAM27560) is known and was used as a primary query in a Blast analysis using the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 PAK strain proteome as the subject for the homology search. [00171] To evaluate whether the candidates identified were specific for Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06, their presence in the proteome of another Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype (05, strain PAOl) was analyzed. The 05 O-antigen structure is unrelated to that of 06 and 019. The Top 100 results were analyzed individually for the presence in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 05 proteome using blast analysis. 97 out of 100 candidates from the PAK proteome had homologues in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 05 proteome which indicated that these proteins were generally present in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains and possibly unrelated to 06 O antigen biosynthesis. Three out of the 100 candidates had no obvious homologue in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 05 proteome, and were therefore determined to be Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 specific. [00172] To test whether one of the three identified candidate proteins was a Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 wzy, the three proteins were used as query in a Blast analysis. One of the three candidates, PAK 01823 (06wzy PAK 01823; SEQ ID NO:3), shared amino acid sequence identity to other, known oligosaccharide repeat unit polymerases, e.g, 25% identity to Streptococcus sanguinis oligosaccharide repeat unit polymerases (ACCESSION WP 004192559) and 22% identity to Escherichia coli 0139 oligosaccharide repeat unit polymerases (ACCESSION AAZ85718). Thus, PAK 01823 (06wzy PAK_01823; SEQ ID NO:3) was identified as the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 wzy. [00173] To further confirm SEQ ID NO: 3 as the protein encoded by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 wzy, the subcellular localization of the protein was predicted bioinformatically using PSORTb (www.psort.org/psortb/). The protein was predicted to be localized in the cytoplasmic membrane with 11 transmembrane domains, a feature that is common among O- antigen polymerases. [00174] Proteins equivalent to PA 01823 (06wzy PAK 01823; SEQ ID NO:3) were found in other 06 positive P. aeruginosa strains, including the LESB58 strain (which had a Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 wzy protein with only 1 aa difference compared to the PAK strain and a strain tested internally). [00175] Next, functional testing of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 wzy was carried out. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 rfb cluster, the fmt06 gene (i.e., the gene encoding SEQ ID NO:2, discussed in Example 2, above), and the gene encoding Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 wzy (i.e., the gene encoding SEQ ID NO:3) were co-expressed in E. coli W3110 Awec cells, and the lipopolysaccharide formed was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4). Anti-06 antiserum detected a ladder like signal only in the sample originating from the cells that contained all three transgenes, indicating that PAK 01823 (06wzy PAK 01823; SEQ ID NO:3) is indeed the polymerase of P. aeruginosa 06. Thus, the gene encoding PAK 01823 was named 06wzy. [00176] To generate a single gene cluster containing all genetic elements required to enable E. coli to recombinantly express the P. aeruginosa 06 O antigen, the fmt06 and 06wzy genes (i.e., the genes encoding SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 3, respectively) were cloned downstream of the P. aeruginosa 06 rfb cluster. A schematic representation of the cloning of the codon usage optimized Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 O-antigen polymerase 06wzy into the cloned Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 rfb cluster along with the 06 formyltransferase and the relative organization of the genes is depicted in Figure 5. It further was determined that the the fmt06 and 6wzy genes (i.e., the genes encoding SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 3, respectively) could be inserted into the P. aeruginosa 06 rfb cluster at multiple positions. Specifically, the fmt06 gene could be inserted in a clockwise orientation relative to the rfb cluster downstream of the rfb cluster or upstream of the rfb cluster under the control of a separate promotor. In addition, the fmt06 gene could be inserted in a counter-clockwise orientation relative to the rfb cluster upstream or downstream of the rfb cluster. The 06wzy gene could be inserted in a clockwise orientation relative to the rfb cluster upstream or downstream of the rfb cluster or upstream of the rfb cluster under the control of a separate promotor. All constructs described above were active in terms of P. aeruginosa 06 O antigen biosynthesis (data not shown). Example 4: Bacterial Strains with an Inserted Oligosaccharyl Transferase and an Inserted rfb, Completed rfb06 Cluster Are Stable and Produce Bioconjugates [00177] Example 1 demonstrates that bioconjugates can successfully be produced by a bacterial host strain that has been genetically modified by insertion of (i) a nucleic acid encoding an oligosaccharyl transferase and (ii) a nucleic acid encoding an rfb cluster. In this Example, experiments similar to those described in Example 1 were performed, using the Pseudomonas protein PcrV as a carrier protein. [00178] Naturally, the primary amino acid sequence of PcrV (see, e.g., UniProt 030527) does not comprise an N-glycosylation consensus sequence ("glycosite"). Using the methods described in WO 2006/1 19987, recombinant variants of PcrV comprising one, two, three, four, or five glycosites were engineered. In particular, by manipulation of the nucleic acid sequence encoduing PcrV, PcrV variants were created that expressed one, two, three, four, or five of the optimized N-glycosylation consensuss sequence Asp(Glu)-X-Asn-Z-Ser(Thr), wherein X and Z are independently selected from any natural amino acid except Pro. [00179] Modified E. coli host cells were generated by inserting the following directly into the host cell genome: (i) a nucleic acid encoding the C. jejuni oligosaccharyl transferase (PglB) and (ii) a nucleic acid encoding the rfb cluster from the Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06 PAK strain. This rfb cluster encodes genes necessary for O-antigen synthesis of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa serogroup 06 antigen. The insertions were performed using the novel insertion method described in PCT/EP2013/071328 (see Section 5.2, above) or the pUT mini system (Bio medal Lifescience). The E. coli host cells further were modified by introduction of a plasmid that expresses PcrV comprising one to five glycosites, as described above. Thus, the modified E. coli host cells described in this example express (i) the C. jejuni oligosaccharyl transferase (PglB), by virtue of integration of a nucleic acid encoding the oligosaccharyl transferase into the host cell genome; (ii) genes of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa rfb cluster that produce the 06 antigen, by virtue of integration of a nucleic acid encoding the rfb cluster from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK strain into the host cell genome; and (iii) the modified PcrV carrier protein, by virtue of transforming the host cell with a plasmid comprising a modified nucleic acid encoding the carrier protein (where the nucleic acid has been modified so that it encodes one to five glycosites, as described above). [00180] Additional modified E. coli host cells were generated to allow for comparison of the ability of the modified host cells comprising double integrations (integration of an oligosaccharyl transferase and integration of an rfb cluster) to produce bioconjugates (PcrV- 06) with bioconjugate production by host cells having (i) only a single integration of the oligosaccharyl transferase or the rfb cluster and the remaining components (carrier protein and oligosaccharyl transferase or rfb cluster) plasmid expressed by the host cell; or (ii) no integrated components, with all components (carrier protein and oligosaccharyl transferase and rfb cluster) plasmid expressed. [00181] Three different E. coli strains were used and compared in the analysis: (i) "St7343," which comprises both pglB and the completed 06 rfb cluster inserted into the host cell genome (i.e., is a double integrated strain), and a plasmid encoding a PcrV carrier protein (with one, two, three, four, or five glycosites); (ii) "St7209," which comprises plasmid- expressed pglB, the 06 rfb cluster inserted into the host cell genome, and a plasmid encoding a PcrV carrier protein (with one, two, three, four, or five glycosites); and (iii) "St2182," which comprises plasmid-expressed pglB, plasmid-expressed 06 rfb cluster, and a plasmid encoding a PcrV carrier protein (with one, two, three, four, or five glycosites). Figure 6 depicts the characteristics of each strain (6A: St7343; 6B: St7209; 6C: St2182). [00182] As shown in Figure 6, all strains expressing an oligosaccharyl transferase, carrier protein, and an rfb cluster produced bioconjugates. See the blots depicted between kDa markers 40-70 (around the kDa 5 marker), which correspond to PcrV-06. Importantly, as shown in Example 1 , this observation includes strains comprising double integration of an oligosaccharyl transferase and an rfb cluster. See, in particular, the results shown in Figure 6A. Thus, like Example 1 , this Example demonstrates not only that stable host cells can be generated following double insertion of genes/gene clusters into the host cell genome, but that function of the genes is maintained. Specifically, function of the inserted oligosaccharyl transferase and inserted rfb cluster was preserved, resulting in the production of bioconjugates. Example 5: Production and purification of EPA-06 bioconjugates [00183] This example describes the production of bioconjugates comprising the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 antigen. [00184] E. coli W31 10 AwaaL Awec Arfb was transformed with plasmids comprising the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 rfb cluster, the oligosaccharyl transferase pglB from C. jejuni, the gene encoding the detoxified carrier protein EPA, and the QuiNAc biosynthesis/transferase genes wbpVLM (from a Pseudomonas aeruginosa 06 strain). Results of plasmid retention analysis are depicted in Figure 8. Medium (LB broth) supplemented with Tetracyclin, Spectinomycin, Kanamycin and Ampicillin was inoculated with host cells containing all four plasmids. The pre-culture was grown overnight at 37°C. The next day, medium (TB) supplemented with MgCl2, Tetracyclin, Spectinomycin, Kanamycin and Ampicillin was inoculated by diluting the preculture to Οϋβοο 0.1. Cells were grown at 37°C until approximately OD60o 0.8-1.0 was reached, then expression of pglb, epa and wbpVLM was induced by the addition of ImM IPTG and 0.1% arabinose. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after over night induction. [00185] EPA-06 bioconjugates were purified from periplasmic extracts of modified host cells using Metal-chelate affinity chromatography (IMAC), anion exchange chromatography (Source Q) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Elution fractions containing glycoconjugates were pooled and subsequently submitted to the next chromatography step. The final SEC eluates were characterized by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot using the antibodies indicated in Figure 7. [00186] The EPA-06 bioconjugate was characterized using an array of analytical methods. The level of endotoxin was measured using the LAL assay (13EU/ml). Purity was determined by SDS-PAGE and capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE, 86% purity). The amount of protein was measured using the BCA assay (1.75mg/mi). The amount of polysaccharide was measured using the Anthrone assay (Dubois et al., 1956; 311.6ug/ml). The average size of the 06-Polymer was determined using a high resolution "degree-of-glycosylation" (DOG) SDS-PAGE (average of 7.9 repeating units per polymer). Determination of electric iso forms of the bioconjugate was done by isoelectric focusing (IEF). Finally, the identity of the bioconjugate was confirmed by Immunoblotting using antibodies directed against the protein (EPA) or the polysaccharide (06). Example 6: Immunization Studies [00187] This Example demonstrates that the P. aeruginosa 06-EPA bioconjugate is immunogenic. [00188] Female, 6 week old BALB/c OlaHsd mice (in groups of 25) were immunized intramuscularly at days 0, 14 and 28 with 0.2 μg or 2 μg of 06-EPA conjugate (see Example 5) in a non adjuvanated or adjuvanated formulation (with an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant). A control group of 10 mice was vaccinated with ajuvant (O/W) alone. Anti-06 ELISA and opsonic titers were determined in individual sera collected at day 42 (14 post III) and on pooled Post -II and Post-Ill sera. Results are shown in Figure 9 and described in detail below. [00189] Figure 9A depicts the anti-06 ELISA response. Purified 06 LPS-06 (Pa06a,6c) was coated at 8 μg/ml in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) on high-binding microtitre plates (Nunc Maxisorp), overnight at 4° C. The plates were blocked with PBS-BSA 1% for 30 min at RT with agitation. The mice antisera were prediluted 1/10 and then, further two fold dilutions were made in microplates and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with agitation. After washing, bound murine antibody was detected using Jackson ImmunoLaboratories Inc. peroxidase-conjugated AffmiPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (ref: 115-035-003) diluted 1/5000 in PBS-tween 0.05%-BSA 0.2%. The detection antibodies were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with agitation. The color was developed using 4 mg OPD + 5 μΐ H202 per 10 ml pH 4.5 0.1M citrate buffer for 15 minutes in the dark at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 50 μΐ HCl, and the optical density (OD) was read at 490 nm relative to 650 nm. [00190] The level of anti-06 antibodies present in the sera was expressed in mid-point titers. A GMT of individual sera was calculated for the 25 samples in each treatment group (10 for the control group). [00191] An immune response was observed in mice after injection of the bioconjugate formulated with the adjuvant. No difference was observed between doses. Similar observations were made regarding the percentage of seroconversion. No or very weak responses were observed with the non adjuvanted formulation. [00192] Figure 9B shows opsonic titer in HL60 cells from mice immunized with 06-EPA bioconjugate formulated with adjuvant or not. [00193] The opsonophagocytosis assay (OPA) was performed in round-bottom microplates with 15 μΐ of HL-60 phagocytic cells (adjusted to 5 10e6 cells/ml), 15 μΐ of P. aeruginosa bacteria (grown on TSA agar plate), 15 μΐ of the test serum dilutions, and 15 μΐ of piglet complement. The inactivated test pooled sera were first diluted (1/16 or 1/50 final dilution) in HBSS-BSA 1% and added to a P. aeruginosa 06 strain (strain ID: FINCMB 170009, obtained from Hungarian National Collection of Medical Bacteria) diluted in order to count 200-250 CFU/well at the end of the test. [00194] The HL-60 cells (adjusted to 5.10e6/ml) and the piglet complement (12.5% final) were then added in each well. A control with inactivated complement was included for each test sample. [00195] The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 90 minutes with agitation. After a 1/200 dilution, 50 μΐ of the volume was then transferred into a flat-bottom microplate. 50 μΐ of MH agar followed by PBS-0.9% agar was added. Automated colony counts were performed after an overnight incubation at 34°C. [00196] The opsonophagocytic activity is expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution giving at least 50% killing. [00197] The data demonstrate the functionality of the antibodies induced after injection with the adjuvanted group. [00198] In conclusion, this example demonstrates that the P. aeruginosa 06-EPA bioconjugate is both immunogenic and functional (i.e., induces antibodies that kill P. aeruginosa 06 in vivo).
