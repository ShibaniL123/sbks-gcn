Step 6. Synthesis of N-ethyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydrobenzo[cd]indol-6-yl)butane-1-sulfonamide
A reaction mixture of compound 6-amino-1-ethylbenzo[cd]indol-2(1H)-one (80 mg, 0.38 mmol) and butane-1-sulfonyl chloride (89 mg, 0.57 mmol) in pyridine (5 mL) was stir red at 80° C. for 1 h. Dilute HCl was added, the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL×3), and the organic layer was washed with water and brine, dried with Na2SO4 and evaporated. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography with petroleum and ether/ethyl acetate (4/1, v/v) to afford N-ethyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydrobenzo[cd]indol-6-yl)butane-1-sulfonamide (66 mg, 52%).
