Step 2: Preparation of 5-(piperazine-1-yl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
Analogous to the process for preparing Compound d in Step 4 in Example 1, Compound k was deprotected by reacting with trifluoroacetic acid to produce Compound l: 5-(piperazine-1-yl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (307 mg, yield 73%). MS(ESI)m/z: [M+H]+=204.
