DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES FIGS. 1A-B show physical characterization of amorphous form of compound of formula I. FIG. 1A shows an X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD) pattern of a diffused halo, typical of amorphous material. FIG. 1B shows a polarized microscopy image. No birefringence was observed. FIG. 2 shows a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) profile of amorphous compound of formula I showing weight loss (due to presence of solvent: water and ethanol) up to 150° C. FIG. 3 shows a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profile of amorphous compound of formula I where glass transition is evident in the second heating cycle after solvent removal in the first heating cycle. Glass transition onset temperature for the sample is 114° C. FIG. 4 shows a FT-Raman spectra of amorphous compound of formula I. FIG. 5 shows an XRPD pattern of the product of Example 1, which shows both diffracted peaks and amorphous halo demonstrating by XRPD. FIG. 6 shows a polarized light microscopy image of the product of Example 1, where birefringence is observed. FIG. 7 shows a water sorption analysis of the product of Example 1, with continuous water sorption profile at 25° C. from 0-90% RH (deliquescence point at ˜75% RH). FIG. 8 shows a FT-Raman spectra of the product of Example 1, overlaid with amorphous form of compound of formula I. FIG. 9 shows a DSC profile of the product of Example 1. The first endotherm signifies solvent loss (water and ethanol). The second, sharp endotherm overlaps with a “step change” (change in baseline) event. To resolve these two events, a temperature modulation (±0.5° C. over 80 sec) was used, and the endotherm (with an associated enthalpy change of 7-11 J/g) was found to overlap with a glass transition temperature (onset ˜130° C.). FIG. 10 shows a modulated DSC profile of the second endotherm of FIG. 9. FIG. 11 shows various XRPD patterns as a function of temperature. Heating the the product of Example 1 leads to loss in structure (diffracted peaks start to disappear in the 100-160° C. range) and the solid-state form becomes amorphous. FIG. 12 shows various XRPD patters as a function of exposure to water vapor (relative humidity or RH) of the product of Example 1. Upon exposure to water vapor at room temperature (different RH/relative humidity conditions generated by using different salt solutions) for 5-7 days, the starting marterial loses crystallinity as suggested by loss of diffracted peak intensity as a function of increasing RH. Upon drying the sample exposed to 60% RH for 4 hours under reduced pressure (top most XRPD pattern), the crystallinity does not reappear. FIG. 13 shows representative XRPD patterns of the product of Example 1, (bottom) compared to granules of amorphous form of compound of formula I (prepared according to processes described herein) stored under ICH guidelines for 12 weeks. Diffracted peaks from crystalline regions are not present in the XRPD patterns of the granules of the amorphous form of formula I in the formulations described herein. FIG. 14 shows DSC profiles of formulations comprising amorphous compound of formula I prepared as described herein. The profiles show consistent Tg of 124-130° C. (onset) over 12 weeks of storage for the formulation. The water content of granules stays between 3.5-4.5% (T0 water content=3.5-4%). FIG. 15 shows XRPD profiles of two solvates of compound of formula I (glyceryl capyrlate top, glyceryl laurate bottom). FIG. 16 shows variable temperature XRPD patterns of glyceryl capyrlate (Capryol 90™ solvate) of compound of formula I.

FIG. 21 shows the XRPD profile for a methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) solvate of compound of formula I formed by precipitating the solvate from MEK or a mixture of MEK with a solvent. FIG. 22 shows the XRPD profile for a methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) solvate of compound of formula I formed by precipitating the solvate from MIBK or a mixture of MIBK with a solvent. FIG. 23 shows the XRPD profile for a toluene solvate of compound of formula I formed by precipitating the solvate from toluene with a solvent. FIG. 24 shows the XRPD of pre and post milled batches of a compound of Formula I prepared by Direct Wet Granulation of a composition comprising partially crystalline compound of Formula I. Conversion of the partially crystalline form to amorphous form at 33% drug load, as well as at 43% drug load, occurs, without solution mediated precipitation. FIG. 25 shows the moisture sorption isotherm for a postmilled batch of a compound of Formula I prepared by Direct Wet Granulation of a composition comprising partially crystalline compound of Formula I at 43% drug load, which shows that the hygroscopicity of the compound is minimized by use of amorphous/fumed silica as an internal desiccant and the moisture sorption behavior is comparable to granules prepared from solution mediated precipitation of a compound of formula I.

It has been found that certain forms have improved properties useful for formulating the compound into stable drug forms for treating diseases such as cancer. One aspect includes a solid composition comprising a compound of formula I and solvent. Another aspect includes a crystalline solid composition comprising a compound of formula I and solvent. Example solvents for the solid composition include capryol glycol, lauryl glycol, MEK, MIBK, MTBK, chloroform, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, toluene, chlorobenzene, ethylbenzene, THF, 2-MethylTHF, 1,2-dichloroethane, ortho-xylene, meta-xylene, para-xylene, anisole, methyl acetate, cumene, tetralin, propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, diisobutyl ketone, isobutyl acetate, t-butyl acetate, amyl acetate, glycerol triacetate, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane, 2,2-dimethoxypropane, ethyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, water and mixtures thereof (including ether-ethanol mixture). In certain embodiments, the solid composition comprises variable levels of solvent. In certain embodiments, the solid composition comprises solvent solvated to the compound of formula I. Example solvates of the solid composition include channel or layered solvates. In one example, the solid composition comprises compound of formula I, fully substituted with solvent, such as 1:1 molar ratio solvate. In another example, the solid composition comprises compound of formula I, partially substituted with solvent, such as in a w/w % (solvent:compound of formula I) in the range of about 0.1% to about 20%, alternatively about 1% to about 15%. In one specific example, a solid composition comprises a compound of formula I and ethyl acetate in a ratio of about 16% to about 1% ethyl acetate. Another aspect includes a mesomorphous form of compound of formula I comprising intermediate order, which results from crystallizing the compound of formula I from a solvent mixture comprising antisolvent. Another aspect includes a condis crystalline form of compound of formula I that has intermediate order, resulting from crystallizing from a solvent mixture comprising antisolvent. Another aspect includes an amorphous form of compound of formula I that results from isolating from solvent. The amorphous form has certain improved pharmaceutical properties and can be formulated into stable drug forms for treating diseases such as cancer. Therefore, one aspect includes amorphous (S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-((5R,7R)-7-hydroxy-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[d]pyrimidin-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)-3-(isopropylamino)propan-1-one monohydrochloride (a compound of formula I). Another aspect includes a liquid-fill capsule formulation of compound of formula I, comprising a compound of formula I and a liquid fill solvent. Liquid fill solvents for use in the liquid fill formulations include solvents that comprise a lipidic (for example, C3-20 alkyl) group and hydroxyl group. In one example, liquid fill solvents are mono-esters, di-esters and tri-esters of fatty acids (C3-20 alkyl or C8-18 alkyl) and glycerol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol. Examples include lipids, such as glyceryl stearates, for example esters of natural fatty, stearic and palmitic acids with glycerin, and alkylglycol caprylates, and the like. Other examples include propylene glycol monocaprylate type II (Capryol 90™), PEG-32 glyceryl laurate-(Gelucire® 44/14), Propylene glycol monocaprylate type I (Imwitor 792), PEG-6 glyceryl oleate, (Labrafil® M 1944CS), PEG-6 glyceryl linoleate, (Labrafil® M 2125 CS), Propylene glycol monolaurate type II, (Lauroglycol 90), Poloxamer 188, (Lutrol F68NF), Poloxamer 407, (Lutrol F127 NF), Polyethyleneglycol (PEG)1500, Propylene glycol, Glycerol (Glycerin), d-alpha tocopheryl PEG-1000 succinate, (VitaminE-TPGS), PEG-8 caprylic/capric glycerides (Labrasol®), and esters of caprylic or capric fatty acids with glycerin or propylene glycol (for example, Miglyol 810N or Miglyol 812N). In another example, liquid fill solvents are those solvents with critical micelle concentration (cmc) values greater than about 0.9 g/g with the compound of formula I. In certain embodiments, the liquid fill solvent is propylene glycol caprylate (in one example, the product sold commercially as Capryol 90™, Gattefosse). The liquid fill solvent can be present in a range of about 36.5% w/w to about 60% w/w depending on the dosage strength, i.e., the amount of compound of formula I. In another example, the liquid fill solvent is a solvent in which the compound of formula I can be dissolved in concentrations between about 0.7 and 1 g/g, including propylene glycol monocaprylates (e.g., types I and II), PEG-8 caprylic/capric glycerides, glycyl laurate (for example Lauroglycol™), glycerol, propylene glycol and PEG-8 caprylic/capric glycerides. In certain embodiments, the liquid fill solvent is selected from liquid fill solvents described herein that are further compatible with hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and hard gelatin capsules such as propylene glycol monocaprylate type II (Capryol 90™) and Lauroglycol™ 90. In certain embodiments, the liquid-fill formulation further comprises an antioxidant. Antioxidants include ascorbic acid, methionine, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). In one example, the antioxidant comprises BHA. In one example, the antioxidant comprises BHT. In certain embodiments, the liquid fill formulation comprises about 0.1% w/w antioxidant. In certain embodiments, the liquid-fill formulation further comprises anti-crystallization additives. In one example, the additive is PVP polymer. The liquid-fill formulation allows for unexpectedly high concentrations of compound of formula I, which allows for the production of a single, high dosage unit with strengths between 100-mg and 400-mg. Such high doses are generally unachievable with active pharmaceutical ingredients in the lipid like liquid fill solvent systems. For example, it was unexpectedly discovered that compound of formula I is surface active in the presence of propylene glycol caprylate which provides the ability to reach high concentration liquid fill formulations. The critical micelle concentration for GDC-0068 in propylene glycol caprylate (e.g., Capryol 90™) was determined to be 0.945 g/g. Additionally, several compounds with known high aqueous solubility as well as poor aqueous solubility were tested for the maximum amounts that could be dissolved in Capryol 90™. Highly water-soluble compounds tested were ascorbic acid, metformin, acetyl salicylic acid and acetaminophenol. Poorly water-soluble compounds tested were griseofulvin, indomethacin and naproxen. None of the model compounds could be dissolved at greater than 10% w/w concentration in Capryol 90™. Therefore, another aspect includes a liquid fill formulation of a compound of formula I, comprising about 100 mg to about 400 mg of compound of formula I (measured as free base), about 36.5% w/w to about 60% w/w propylene glycol caprylate and about 0.1% w/w antioxidant. In one example, the antioxidant is BHA. In one example, a liquid-fill formulation comprises 100 mg compound of formula I. In one example, a liquid-fill formulation comprises 400 mg compound of formula I. In one example, the formulation further comprises a capsule. Another aspect includes a tablet formulation, comprising amorphous compound of formula I and filler. In one example, the formulation comprises amorphous compound of formula I and silica. In another example, the formulation further comprises inhibitors of crystallization, such as PVP or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and optionally further comprises antioxidant. such as BHT or BHA. In certain embodiments, the tablet comprises about 33% w/w amorphous compound of formula I, about 15% w/w silica (in one example, the product sold commercially as Cab-o-sil, Cabot, Corp.), about 43% w/w microcrystalline cellulose, about 5% w/w croscarmellose sodium, about 2.5% w/w PVP, about 0.1% w/w BHA, and about 1% w/w stearic acid. Another aspect includes a process of producing amorphous compound of formula I, comprising contacting a compound of formula I with a solvent, and removing the solvent to form the amorphous compound of formula I. Alternatively, the process of producing amorphous compound of formula I comprises removing solvent from a solvate of a compound of formula I, such as by drying or contacting the solvate with moist nitrogen or other inert gas. Alternatively, the process of producing amorphous compound of formula I comprises spray drying a solution of compound of formula I to form amorphous material. In one example of spray drying, the material (for example crystalline or mesomorphous material) is dissovled in a solvent and spray dried to produce the amorphous compound of formula I. Example solvents for use in the spray drying process include water and ethanol. The starting material can be any form of the compound of formula I, for example, a solvate of a compound of formula I, such as the ethyl acetate solvate, or material prepared according to Example 1. In one example, the spray dried amorphous product comprises about 0.01 to about 2.5% residual solvent. In one example, the spray dried amorphous product comprises about 0.01 to about 1.0% residual solvent. In one example, the ethyl acetate solvate is contacted with water and spray dried to give amorphous compound of formula I comprising less than about 1.0% w/w water and about 0.25% w/w or less ethyl acetate. In another example, the ethyl acetate solvate is contacted with ethanol and spray dried to give amorphous compound of formula I comprising less than about 1.0% w/w water, about 2.5% w/w or less ethanol and about 0.25% w/w or less ethyl acetate. In certain embodiments, the process further comprises drying the spray-dried amorphous material to further reduce the amount of water and solvent. In one example, the further dried amorphous spray-dried compound of formula I comprises less than about 0.5% solvent. In certain embodiments, the contacting of a compound of formula I with a solvent further comprises dissolving the compound of formula I in the solvent. In certain embodiments, the solvent comprises ethanol. In one example, the solvent comprises water. In certain embodiments the solvent comprises ethanol:water, for example in 1:1 mixture. In certain embodiments, the solvent further comprises additives, for example, inhibitors of crystallization, such as polymers, for example polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and other additives, such as antioxidants or preservatives, for example, BHA or BHT. Another aspect includes a pharmaceutical formulation comprising an amorphous compound of formula I. Another aspect includes a process of producing a tablet formulation comprising amorphous compound of formula I, comprising contacting a compound of formula I with a solvent comprising ethanol to form a mixture; contacting the mixture with filler comprising crystalline cellulose; and removing the solvent to form the pharmaceutical formulation comprising amorphous compound of formula I. In certain embodiments, the solvent further comprises water. In certain embodiments, the solvent further comprises stabilizer, for example, PVP polymer, and antioxidant, for example BHA or BHT. Another aspect includes a process of producing a tablet formulation comprising contacting a mesomorphous form of a compound of formula I, cellulose and silica (for example amorphous or colloidal silica). The process includes contacting the mesomorphous form, cellulose and silica with a solvent mixture of ethanol and water and removing the solvent mixture by drying the mixture to form the amorphous form of the compound of formula I, which is entrapped in the mixture. It was unexpectedly found that such a direct wet granulation process would result in an amorphous form of the drug substance of formula I. The hygroscopicity of the final formulation obtained by such a direct wet granulation is surprisingly similar to that of the formulation prepared from a solution mediated precipitation of the compound of formula I alone. In certain embodiments, the tablet manufacturing process includes (a) dissolving antioxidant and stabilizer in a 50:50 mixture of solvent comprising ethanol, and optionally further comprising water to form a mixture; (b) dissolving compound of formula I into the mixture to form a solution; (c) granulating the solution with filler to form granules; (d) drying the granules; and (e) compressing the granules to produce the tablet. In one example, the process further comprises before (e): mixing additional ingredients to form a blend. In certain embodiments, the granulating process further comprises high-shear granulating the solution with filler comprising crystalline cellulose. In certain embodiments, the filler comprises microcrystalline cellulose. In certain embodiments, the filler further comprises fumed amorphous silica, and optionally further comprises croscarmellose sodium. In one example, the filler comprises highly porous microcrystalline cellulose and fumed silica. In certain embodiments, drying the granules further comprises drying at an elevated temperature. In certain embodiments, the temperature for drying granules is in the range of about 50° C. and 60° C. Predicting and controlling the amount of crystallinity in a drug dosage form is important for several reasons including obtaining predictable bioavailability and quality control in manufacturing. It is also important to have stable drug forms of hygroscopic drug substances to prevent the drug forms from changing crystalline nature. Mesomorphous forms of a compound of formula I, for example, a condis-crystal form of the compound of formula I, can have analytically variable levels of crystallinity and is hygroscopic. The tablet production process described herein can transform a sample of compound of formula I from a mesomorphous form, and in one embodiment a condis-crystal form, to a drug product comprising amorphous compound of formula I, and mitigates hygroscopicity problems (i.e., deliquescence) by adsorbing the compound of formula I into a highly porous structure of filler (for example, fumed silica) and thereby protecting the compound of formula I from the moisture gain. Another aspect provides a solid unit oral pharmaceutical dosage form comprising amorphous compound of formula I in an amount of 100 mg to 400 mg calculated as the freebase form, and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, stabilizer or excipient. In certain embodiments, the solid unit oral pharmaceutical dosage form comprises amorphous compound of formula I in an amount of 100 mg.

BHA and PVP were dissolved into the ethanol-water solution (50:50 mix to make a total of 15 mL). The compound of formula I was slowly added to the solution with vigorous stirring conditions. Small amounts were added in incremental portions so as to allow complete dissolution. In a 0.5 L Diosna granulator bowl, the batch amounts of microcrystalline cellulose, Syloid 244 and croscarmellose sodium were mixed for 2 minutes in the high shear granulator using the impeller under a dry state so as to get a uniform mixture. This was followed by drop-wise addition of the solution containing the compound of formula I under constant agitation of the powder bed in the high shear granulator. After adding all the solution, the beaker was rinsed with about 2 mL of water and added dropwise into the granulation under agitation to so as to ensure the entire batch amount of solution is incorporated into the granulation. This was followed by a final rinse step of about 1 mL ethanol also added with agitation. After completion of the rinse addition, the impeller speed was increased and the chopper blade was turned on so as to perform the kneading or wet massing and facilitate particle growth. After about 2 minutes of kneading, a clear visual increase in particle size was observable and the granulation end-point could be confirmed by granule squeeze test. The granules were dried in a tray oven for about 4.5 hours to remove the ethanol and water. The final loss on drying from the granules was measured to be less than 3% w/w suggesting a dry granulation. Using the dried granules and re-calculating the exact amount of croscarmellose sodium and stearic acid required for the batch, pre-screened stearic acid was added stepwise to the batch and mixed on a turbula mixer. The final lubricated granulation was compressed on a Carver hydraulic press using capsule shaped tooling in order to compress 300-mg potency tablets at a press weight of 1000-mg.

The compound of formula I was dissolved under high speed stirring in order to prevent clumping. The dissolver blade was rotated at 1000 rpm until a clear solution could be obtained. In a 4 L Diosna granulator bowl, the batch amounts of microcrystalline cellulose, CaboSil (fumed silica) and croscarmellose sodium were mixed for 2 minutes in the high shear granulator using the impeller under a dry state so as to get a uniform mixture. A persistaltic pump was set up to dispense the compound of formula I and granulating fluid at a controlled rate. A speed of 12 gram/minute provided a steady stream for the granulating solution containing compound of formula I being added into the bed while the impeller speed of the granulator was maintained at 150-rpm. After addition of the granulating fluid and the rinse solution making up a total of about 35% w/w ethanol-water with respect to the batch size, a clear growth in particle size was observed and also tracked by an increase in power consumption by the machine. This indicated an end-point of the granulation process. Finally, a wet-massing step was carried out at the impeller speed of 250 rpm and a chopper speed of 500-rpm in order to produce a uniform granulation. The granules were dried in fluid-bed drying equipment at 50° C. inlet air and 35 cubic feet per minute air swaps. The granules dried to moisture content of less than 3% w/w when the product temperature equilibrated at 42° C. The dried granules were then sized through a miller (Quadro-Comill) to obtain the desired particle size using a #16 mesh screen, a #18 screen and a #20 screen to identify the optimal screen size. These milled granules were mixed with the extra-granular portion of croscarmellose sodium and then lubricated with steric acid. Tablets having 100-mg and 300-mg strengths of compound of formula I were compressed on a Piccola tablet press using a 10-mm diameter round tooling for the 100-mg strength. The dissolution profiles in the figure below suggested that the milling screen size did not affect the dissolution behavior and either screen could be utilized.

A persistaltic pump was set up to dispense the compound of formula I and granulating fluid at a controlled rate and the solution was sprayed on to the powder bed of cellulose and silica using an atomization nozzle (Spray Systems) with a atomizing pressure of 3 psi. A speed of 91 gram/minute provided a good spray pattern for distributing the granulating solution containing compound of formula I over the powder bed while the impeller speed of the granulator was maintained at 100-rpm.

This was followed by addition of the solution using a peristaltic pump at a pum rate of 20 grams per minute to obtain a steady stream of granulating fluid containing the BHA and PVP dissolved in ethanol and water, under constant agitation of the powder bed in the high shear granulator at 170 rpm. After adding all the solution, the beaker was rinsed with about 30 grams of ethanol/water and added drop wise into the granulation under agitation to so as to ensure the entire batch amount of solution is incorporated into the granulation. After completion of the rinse addition, the impeller speed was increased to 200 rpm and the chopper blade was turned on so as to perform the kneading or wet massing and facilitate particle growth. After about 2 minutes of kneading, a clear visual increase in particle size was observable and the granulation end-point could be confirmed by granule squeeze test. The granules dried in a fluid-bed dryer to moisture content of less than 3% w/w when the product temperature equilibrated at 42° C. The dried granules were then sized through a miller (Fitz-mill with knives forward) to obtain the desired particle size using a #16 mesh screen, a #18 screen and a #20 screen to identify the optimal screen size. These milled granules were mixed with the extra-granular portion of croscarmellose sodium and then lubricated with steric acid. Tablets having 100-mg and 300-mg strengths of compound of formula I were compressed on a Piccola tablet press using a 10-mm diameter round tooling for the 100-mg strength and plain capsule shaped tooling having the dimensions of 0.3437″×0.7500″ capsule for the 300-mg strength tablets.

At temperatures >80° C., there is substantial loss of crystallinity. In both samples, they appear to be X-ray amorphous at 90° C. and above (due to melting of the lattice solvent and dissolution of the solid phase in it as confirmed by hot stage microscopy). Taken together, the analysis of the solvates shows them to be highly crystalline, stable, non-hygroscopic, have about 18-22% solvent uptake in the crystal lattice and at ambient temperature, exhibit almost 2 fold lower solubility in respective solvents than the material of Example 1. Example 10 Amorphous (S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-((5R,7R)-7-hydroxy-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[d]pyrimidin-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)-3-(isopropylamino)propan-1-one monohydrochloride The material of Example 1 was dissolved in 10 volumes of ethanol. A stir bar was added to the rotovap flask and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator to give foam. The foam is scraped to knock down the foam and drying is continued until a free flowing solid is obtained. A sample of the product (4.70 mg), is placed in a pre-weighed aluminum pan and placed in the oven on a TA Instruments Q5000SA vapor sorption analyzer. The sample was heated to 50° C. under a stream of dry nitrogen and equilibrated. The relative humidity was increased to 50% at 50° C. and held there for 2 hours. The humidity was then lowered to 0% RH while the temperature was maintained at 50° C. and held there for 2 hours. The sample was then analyzed by XRPD (FIG. 27) and modulated DSC (FIG. 28). The DVS program is graphically shown in FIG. 26. The DSC method was done by using modulated DSC at a rate of 2° C./minute with modulation of ±1° C. every 60 seconds using a lightly crimped pan which allows solvent to escape during the run. Example 11 (S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-((5R,7R)-7-hydroxy-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[d]pyrimidin-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)-3-(isopropylamino)propan-1-one monohydrochloride toluene solvate Toluene, 5 mL, was added to material from Example 1 (20 mg). The slurry was heated to 50° C. in a shaker block for 1 day. Most of the solid was dissolved and then a small amount precipitated from solution at 50° C. Most of the liquid was removed and the suspension was allowed to cool to room temperature. Crystals suitable for structure determination were obtained.

Amorphous compound of Formula I was dissolved in a mixture of toluene, 1 mL, and tetrahydrofuran, 600 pt. The solution was placed into a desiccator to slowly evaporate. The lid of the desiccator was opened periodically to allow the solvent vapors to escape. After 7 days, crystals were isolated from the remaining solution (FIG. 30A). The product was dried at 50° C. and 50 torr for 1 hour to give a partially desolvated toluene solvate.
