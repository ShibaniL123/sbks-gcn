Synthesis of hydantoin containing peptide products Description The present invention relates to a method of synthesizing a peptide product comprising at least one hydantoin group. The peptide product may be used as a reference material for the quality control of pharmaceutical peptides, particularly for the quality control of exendin peptides. Further, the invention relates to hydantoin building blocks, a method for manufacturing such building blocks and their use for the synthesis of peptide products. Using well-known recombinant DNA and chemical solid phase synthesis processes, several proteins and peptides have been synthesized for pharmaceutical use. The production of these proteins and peptides, however, often leads to a multiplicity of undesired synthesis by-products. This is especially the case when they are produced by solid phase synthesis. With an increase in length of the peptide/protein, leading to an increase in the synthesis steps, these by-products may be present in 50 to 70% of the crude product. The synthesis of hydantoin building blocks for the peptide synthesis is known from Zhang et al., J. Org. Chem. 71 (2006), 1750-1753; Opacic et al,, J. Pept. Res. 66 (2005), 85-93; Vazquez et al., Chem. Med. Chem. 3 (2008), 979-985; Takeuchi et al., Chem. Commun. (2000), 785-786; Nefzi et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 8 (1998), 2273-2278; Lamothe et al., J. Comb. Chem. 4 (2002), 73-78; Chong and Petillo, Tetrahedron Lett. 40 (1999), 2493-2496, and Park and Kurth, Tetrahedron Lett. 41 (2000), 7409-7413. The above documents describe the solid phase synthesis of hydantoin compounds. The preparation of hydantoins comprising acid-labile protected side chains, however, is not known. The present inventors describe a novel synthesis of hydantoin containing peptide products from dipeptides having side chains protected by acid-labile protecting groups such as trityl (Trt), tert-butyl (tBu) or butoxy-carbonyl (Boc). The resulting hydantoins may comprise trifunctional amino acids with acid labile side chain protecting groups or a combination of a bifunctional amino acid and a trifunctional amino acid with an intact side chain protecting group. Further, the inventors have provided a novel process for the manufacture of hydantoins on an acid-labile carrier, ℮. g. a CTC (chlorotritylchloride) resin in combination with a cyclisation e.g. in the presence of a triphosgen. Furthermore, the application provides novel hydantoin building blocks suitable for the solid phase peptide synthesis in order to prepare peptide products with an N-terminal hydantoin group. This method is shown exemplarily for the peptide Lixisenatide (AVE0010), a GLP-1 agonist having a length of 44 amino acids long. The amino acid sequence of Lixisenatide is shown in SEQ ID ΝΟ:1: H-G-E-G-T-F-T-S-D-L-S-K-Q-M-E-E-E-A-V-R-L-F-l-E-W-L-K-N-G-G-P-S-S-G-A-P-P-S-K-K-K-K-K-K-NH2 Lixisenatide is produced by a chemical solid phase synthesis process. In the lixisenatide raw product, several N-terminal hydantoin-containing peptides were found as by-products. It is assumed that they are generated by a reaction of the (Ν-1) amide nitrogen with the carbonyl group of the Fmoc (Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl(Fmoc)) protection group as shown in Figure 1. After removal of fluorenylmethanol, a peptide product comprising an N-terminal hydantoin group is formed leading to a premature termination of the peptide synthesis. The peptide Des [1-12]-hydantoin-(13)-AVE0010 as shown in Figure 1 was identified as a product which cannot be completely separated from AVE0010 by chromatographic procedures. The present inventors have now found that a targeted synthesis of peptide products having N-terminal hydantoin groups such as Des[1-12]-hydantoin(15-44)-ΑΝ/Ε0010 (also designated as Des[1-12] modified (13)-AVE0010) is possible by solid-phase peptide synthesis using a specific hydantoin building block. This building block was synthesized by coupling an Fmoc-protected Met building block on a chlorotritylchloride (CTC) resin. After cleavage of Fmoc, a further building block, namely a side chain-trityl (Trt) protected Gin building block was coupled. After further Fmoc cleavage, a cyclization in the presence of triphosgen was carried out. The cleavage of the hydantoin building block from the resin was carried out under mild conditions, ℮. g. in a 20% solution of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) in dichloromethane (DCM) in order to maintain the acid-labile protecting group on the Gin side chain. The reaction scheme is shown in Figure 2. The resulting product (S)-2-{(S)-2,5-dioxo-4-[2-(trityl-carbamoyl)-ethyl]-imidazolidine-1-yl}-4-methylsulfanyl butyric acid is a novel compound. This compound can be coupled to a fullyprotected peptide product, e.g. FI-(15-44)-AVE0010, immobilized on a suitable solid carrier. After treatment with a suitable reagent, ℮. g. a King’s cocktail (King et al., Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 36 (1990), 255-266), the hydantoin-modified peptide, e.g. Des[1-12] modified(13)-AVE0010 may be cleaved from the carrier. This principle may be used to prepare any hydantoin building block on a suitable carrier, ℮. g. CTC resin. Acid labile protecting groups of the original dipeptide are retained. The resulting hydantoin building blocks may be coupled to the N-terminus of peptides in order to provide hydantoin group containing peptides after cleavage from the carrier. The method of the present invention allows a targeted synthesis of hydantoin group containing peptide products in high yield and purity. These peptide products may e.g. be used as reference materials for the quality control of pharmaceutical peptide products such as lixisenatide.

Step (c) may comprise cleaving the peptide off from the solid phase carrier using suitable cleavage regions such as King’s cocktail. These procedures may be carried out under standard conditions as known in the art.

Preferably, the peptide product is an N-terminally truncated exendin peptide, particularly an N-terminally truncated lixisenatide (AVE0010) having an N-terminal hydantoin group. A specific example of a preferred peptide is which is designated as [Des 1-12]-hydantoin(15-44)-AVE0010 or [Des-1-12]modified (13)-AVE0010. The peptide product of the invention may be used as a reference material, ℮. g. for the quality control of pharmaceutical peptides, particularly for use in a quality control method wherein the amount of undesired hydantoin group containing by-products in a peptide product preparation is quantitatively determined. Quantitative determination of by-products in a peptide product sample preferably involves mass spectrometry. In addition to mass spectrometry, the determination may involve a prior chromatographic procedure, ℮. g. in order to separate other impurities from the peptide product or from other ingredients of the composition. Preferably, mass spectrometry is combined with HPLC. Mass spectrometry is based on a measurement of the mass-to-charge ratio of charged particles. In a typical mass spectrometry procedure, the sample is loaded onto the mass spectrometry instrument and volatilized. The sample components are ionized and the resulting ions are separated in the mass analyzer by electromagnetic fields. The resulting ions are detected and the signal is processed into a mass spectrum. For the ionization of peptide products, electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization (MALDI) may be used. The resulting ions may be detected by highly sensitive methods such as Orbitrap or Fourier Transform (FT)-lon Cyclotron Resonance (ICR) detection systems. By means of mass spectrometry, a peak derived from a hydantoin group containing by-product may be identified. Further, the present invention refers to an peptidic hydantoin building block according to formula (II) as described above, the use of this building block for the synthesis of peptides, particularly in the manufacture of a reference material for the quality control of peptide products and to a method for preparing a compound of formula (II). This method involves cyclisizing a carrier bound dipeptide of formula (IV) as described above in the presence of a cyclization reagent such as triphosgene and optionally a base, e.g. triphosgene/pyridine, triphosgene/triethylamine, triphosgene/imidazole or carbonyldiimidazole optionally in combination with triethylamine or another base. Alternatively, N,N-disuccinimidylcarbonate in presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine or trimethylsilylchloride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine can be used. The cyclisized product may be cleaved off from the carrier under mild conditions wherein protecting groups, particularly a side labile protecting group at the side chains Rv and/or R?, if present, are retained. Preferably, the solid phase carrier is an acid-labile resin such as a chlorotritylchloride resin, a Wang-resin, a Rink-resin or other acid-labile resins known to the person skilled in the art. The cleaving conditions may involve the use of King's cocktail or other cleavage reagents consisting of varying amounts of TFA or other acidic reagents, thio reagents, water or trisalkylated silanes and mixtures thereof. Further, the present invention shall be explained in more detail by the following examples describing synthesis, chromatographic purification and analytic characterization of the hydantoin group containing peptide Des[1-12]-hydantoin-(15-44)-ΑΝ/Ε 0010. Examples 1. Synthesis of Des[1 -12]-hydantoin-(15-44)-AVE 0010 Des[1-12]-hydantoin-(15-44) AVE 0010 is a by-product in the synthesis of the pharmaceutical peptide product AVE0010. It is generated when a hydantoin group is formed by cyclization of amino acids Gin (13) and Met (14) and subsequent termination of peptide synthesis (c.f. Figure 1). The amino acid sequence of Des [1-12]-hydantoin-(15-44)-AVE 0010 is as follows: X-Glu-Glu-Glu-Ala-Val-Arg-Leu-Phe-lle-Glu-Trp-Leu-Lys-Asn-Gly-Gly-Pro-Ser-Ser-Gly-Ala-Pro-Pro-Ser-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys-NFl2 1.1 Synthesis of the building block 2-{2,5-dioxo-4-[2-(trityl-carbamoyl)ethyl]-imidazolidine-1-yl}-4-methylsulfanyl butyric acid The synthesis started from Fmoc-Met-CTC-resiη which was protected by using 25 % piperidine in DMF followed by the coupling of Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OFI using HBTU/DIPEA as coupling reagents. The Fmoc group was cleaved again. For ring closure, 23.2 g H-Gln(Trt)-Met-CTC resin were washed with dichloromethane and afterwards treated with 1.5 g triphosgene in neat pyridine. The suspension was agitated overnight. Subsequently, the resin was washed five times with dichloromethane and diisopropylether each and dried under vacuum. The dried resin was contacted with 100 ml 20% hexafluoroisopropanol in dichloromethane. After stirring for 20 min at room temperature, the liquid phase was removed under nitrogen. The solution was collected and evaporated to dryness after addition of heptane. The crude product thereby obtained was purified by RP-LC via flash chromatography using a C18-material containing cartridge. For purification, a linear gradient starting from 35 % acetonitrile in water plus 0.1 % TFA and reaching 80 % acetonitrile in water plus 0.1 % TFA was used. Fractions were collected and analysed by LC-MS. The product containing fractions were combined and evaporated to dryness after addition of toluene. In total, 1.8 g (S)-2-{(S)-2,5-dioxo-4-[2-(trityl-carbamoyl)-ethyl]-imidazolidin-1-yl}-4-methyl-sulfanyl-butyric acid were obtained. The identity of the purified product was confirmed by LC-MS: Molecular weight 545.2 g/mol (found), 545.0 g/mol (calculated). 1.2 Synthesis of Des[1 -12]-hydantoin-(15-44)-AVE0010 As a starting material, N-terminally Fmoc protected (15-44)-AVE0010 resin was used. The starting material was prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis under standard conditions. 5 g dry Fmoc-(15-44)-AVE0010 resin were mixed with 25 ml DMF, stirred and swollen for 30 min. DMF was then aspirated. After swelling, Fmoc cleavage was carried out in piperidine (25% in DMF). Then, 709.4 mg (S)-2~{(S)-2,5-dioxo-4-[2-(trityl-carbamoyl)-ethyl]imidazolidin-1-yl}-4-methyl-sulfanyl-butyric acid (cf. 1.1) were coupled on the starting material in the presence of 503 mg FIBTU, 62.8 mg FIOBT and 603 μΐ DIPEA. The resin was sucked dry and washed with 3 χ 30 ml DMF, 3 χ 30 ml dichloromethane, 3 χ 30 ml methanol and 3 χ 30 ml diisopropylether. After drying overnight, 9.225 g Des(1-12)-hydantoin-(13)-AVE-0010-resin were obtained. The cleavage of the peptide from the resin was carried out under standard conditions with 2.5 g phenol/2.5 ml FEO/2.5 ml thioanisol/1.25 ml ethandithiol/41 ml trifluoroacetic acid. The yield was 1.49 g Des[1-12]hydantoin-(15-44)-AVE0010 crude product. 2. Chromatographic purification of Des[1 -12]-hydantoin-(15-44)AVE0010 Purification was carried out by two RP-FIPLC steps and subsequent freeze drying. The RP-HPLC steps were conducted with a Varian PrepStar device. Stainless steel columns packed with C18 reverse phase material (e.g. Daisogel C18) were used as stationary phase. FEO + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid were used as mobile phase A and acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase Β. The gradient was carried out at 21-90% mobile phase Β. 0.36 g Des [1-12] hydantoin-(15-44)-AVE0010 with a purity of 92.15% (area % as measured by HPLC) were obtained. An analytical chromatogram of the purified product is shown in Figure 3. 3. Analytic characterization The purified product was characterized mass spectrometrically. Purified AVE0010 was used as a reference standard. This analytic characterization showed the correct product Des [1-12] hydantoin-(15-44)-AVE0010 with a molecular weight (Μ+Η)+ = 3623.014. The AVE0010 standard showed a molecular weight of 4856.544. The mass difference of Des[1-12]-hydantoin(13)-AVE0010 to AVE0010 of 1233.53 corresponds to amino acids (His-Gly-GIn-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Leu-Ser-Lys-12 H20 + CO). The theoretical monoisotopic molecular weight of Des (1-12) hydantoin-(15-44)-ΑΝ/Ε0010 is 3621.95. 1.
