Synthesis of 2-heptyl-4-quinolone, HHQ (Compound 1)
3g methyl-3-anilino-2-decenoate 1 b (10.90 mmol) was added dropwise to 15 ml diphenyl ether at reflux conditions and reflux was maintained for 6 h. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool and dropwise added to n-hexane. The precipitate was filtered and washed with n-hexane. The product was obtained as a white solid (m = 2.27 g, 81 %).
