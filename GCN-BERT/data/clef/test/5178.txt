The present invention relates to an unsaturated polyester resin, suitable to be used in the manufacturing of structural parts, comprising itaconate esters as reactive unsaturations in the resin. Unsaturated polyester (UP) resin compositions that are suitable for construction purposes contain copolymerizable monomers as reactive diluent. Unsaturated polyester resin compositions currently applied for obtaining structural parts often contain considerable quantities of styrene as copolymerizable reactive diluent. As a result of the presence of styrene, styrene may escape during the preparation and curing, but also even during the envisaged long-term use thereof, and causes an undesirable odour, and possibly even also toxic effects. Thus there is a desire to reduce the styrene emission. Due to the fact that the unsaturated polyester resin is only copolymerizable, the amount of styrene can not be reduced further in the styrene containing resins, without detrimentally affecting the mechanical properties of the cured composites. Consequently there is a need for homopolymerizable unsaturated polyester resins. WO-A-9727253 describes the synthesis of itaconic based powder coating resins which are homopolymerizable. In this publication, the standard UP synthesis procedure, in which all the raw materials for the resin are mixed and condensed at higher temperatures, is not applied. The homopolymerizable itaconic based unsaturated polyesters has been prepared by either using the prepolymer approach, in which a hydroxyl functional polymer or oligomer is modified in the second step with itaconic acid and condensed to low acid values combined with high hydroxyl values, or by using the anhydride approach, in which hydroxyl functional polymers are modified with itaconic anhydride resulting in high acid value resins combined with low hydroxyl values. It has now been found that the resins described in WO-A-9727253 are not suitable for construction purposes as the cured resin is either too soft or too brittle. In case the cured resin is too soft, the cured part does not have sufficient mechanical integrity to resist external forces. In case the cured resin is too brittle, the cured part will break easily. The object is to provide an unsaturated polyester resin comprising itaconate esters as reactive unsaturations that is suitable to be applied for construction purposes. The inventors surprisingly found that this could be achieved with an unsaturated polyester resins comprising itaconate esters as reactive unsaturations, with an acid value in the range from 25 to 125 mg KOH/g resin and a molar ratio of hydroxyl end groups and carboxylic acid end groups in the range from 0.33 to 3. An additional advantage is that the unsaturated polyester according to the invention could be synthesized using standard unsaturated polyester synthesis process in which all the raw materials for the resin are mixed and condensed at higher temperatures. Without being bound by theory, it may be the case that the suitability of the resins according to the invention for construction purposes is due to the simultaneous presence of hydroxyl and acid groups. The acid value of the unsaturated polyester resin according to the invention is preferably in the range from 30 to 100 mg KOH/g resin, more preferably from 35 to 75 mg KOH/g resin. As used herein, the acid value of the resin composition is determined titrimetrically according to ISO 2114-2000. In one embodiment of the invention, the molar ratio of hydroxyl end groups and carboxylic acid end groups in the unsaturated polyester resin according to the invention is in the range from 0.33 to 0.9. In another preferred embodiment, the molar ratio of hydroxyl end groups and carboxylic acid end groups in the unsaturated polyester resin according to the invention is in the range from 1.1 to 3. A molar ratio of hydroxyl end groups and carboxylic acid end groups in the unsaturated polyester resin in the range from 1.1 to 3 is preferred as the advantageous effects of the invention are even more pronounced. The hydroxyl value of the unsaturated polyester resin according to the invention is preferably higher than 25 mg KOH/g resin and more preferably higher than 40 mg KOH/g resin. As used herein, the hydroxyl value of the itaconate containing polyester is determined according to ISO 4629-1996. Preferably, the molecular weight of the unsaturated polyester comprising itaconate ester units as reactive unsaturations is at least 300 Dalton, preferably at least 500 Dalton and more preferably at least 750 Dalton. Preferably, the molecular weigth Mn of the unsaturated polyester comprising itaconate ester units as reactive unsaturations is at most 10.000 Dalton, more preferably at most 5000 Dalton.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the molecular weight is in the range from 750 to 5000 Dalton. The glass transition temperature Tg of the unsaturated polyester is preferably at least -70°C and at most 100°C. In case the unsaturated polyester is applied for construction purposes, the glass transition temperature Tg of the unsaturated polyester resin present in the resin composition according to the invention is preferably at least -70°C, more preferably at least -50°C and even more preferably at least -30°C. The Tg of the unsaturated polyester resin present in the resin composition according to the invention is preferably at most 70°C, more preferably at most 50°C and even more preferably at most 30°C. As used herein, the Tg is determined by means of DSC (heating rate 5 °C/min). The unsaturated polyester according to the invention comprises itaconate ester units as building blocks having the following structural formula. The itaconic ester units (also referred to as itaconic acid building blocks) contains an ethylenic unsaturation that is able to copolymerize with copolymerizable monomer in which the unsaturated polyester may be diluted. The unsaturated polyester according to the invention can be manufactured by polycondensation of at least a polyol and itaconic acid or itaconic acid anhydride as unsaturated dicarboxylic acid. The polycondensation may also be effected in the presence of other dicarboxylic acids containing reactive unsaturations, such as for example maleic acid or anhydride and fumaric acid and/or in the presence of saturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides, like for example oxalic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid and/or in the presence of aromatic saturated dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides like for example phthalic acid or anhydride and isophthalic acid. In the polymerisation is further used a di-or polyfunctional alcohol. Preferably, a diol is used, such as for example 1,2-propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, neopentyl glycol , hydrogenated bisphenol-A. or ethoxylated /propoxylated bisphenol A. According to a preferred embodiment the molecular weight of the diol in the unsaturated polyester resin is in the range from 60 to 250 Dalton.

In one embodiment, the unsaturated polyester resin according to the invention can be applied as a powder coating resin. The preparation of powder coating compositions is described by Misev in "Powder Coatings, Chemistry and Technology" (pp. 224-300; 1991, John Wiley) hereby incorporated by reference.

The diluent will be applied, for instance, for lowering of the viscosity of the resin composition in order to make handling thereof more easy. For clarity purpose, a reactive diluent is a diluent that is able to copolymerize with the unsaturated polyester resin. Ethylenically unsaturated compounds can be advantageously used as reactive diluent. Preferably, styrene, dimethyl itaconate and/or a methacrylate containing compound is used as reactive diluent.

More preferably, the amount of inhibitor in the resin composition is in the range of from 0,001 to 1 % by weight. The skilled man quite easily can assess, in dependence of the type of inhibitor selected, which amount thereof leads to good results according to the invention. The present invention further relates to a process for radically curing the resin composition according to the invention, wherein the curing is effected by adding an initiator to the resin composition as described above. Preferably, the curing is effected at a temperature in the range of from -20 to +200 °C, preferably in the range of from -20 to +100 °C, and most preferably in the range of from -10 to +60 °C (so-called cold curing). The initiator is a photoinitiator, a thermal initiator and/or redox initiator. As meant herein, a photo initiator is capable of initiating curing upon irradiation Photo initiation is understood to be curing using irradiation with light of a suitable wavelength (photo irradiation). This is also referred to as light cure. A photo-initiating system may consist of a photo initiator as such, or may be a combination of a photo initiator and a sensitizer, or may be a mixture of photo initiators, optionally in combination with one or more sensitizers. The photo initiating system that can be used in the context of the present invention can be chosen from the large group of photo-initiating systems known to the skilled person. A vast number of suitable photo initiating systems, can be found in, for instance, Volume 3 of "Chemistry and Technology of UV and EB Formulations", 2nd Edition, by K. Dietliker and J. V. Crivello (SITA Technology, London; 1998). The thermal initiator can be selected from azo compounds like for example azo isobutyronitril (AIBN), C-C labile compounds like for example benzopinacole, peroxides, and mixtures thereof.

As used herein, structural resin compositions are capable of providing structural parts which are suitable to be applied for construction purposes. Generally such resin compositions are non-aqueous systems. They contain at most 5% by weight of water, mainly resulting from the reactions during resin preparation. As meant herein, structural parts are considered to have a thickness of at least 0.5 mm and appropriate mechanical properties after curing. End segments where the resin compositions according to the present invention can be applied are for example automotive parts, boats, chemical anchoring, roofing, construction, containers, relining, pipes, tanks, flooring, windmill blades. The present invention in particular relates to cured objects or structural parts obtained by curing of a resin composition according to the invention with an initiator, preferably comprising a peroxide. According to one embodiment, the curing is preferably effected by moulding, more preferably the curing is effected by compression moulding to obtain in particular a SMC or BMC part. The moulding is preferably effected at a temperature of at least 130°C, more preferably at least 140°C; and at a temperature of at most 170°C, more preferably of at most 160°C. The invention is now demonstrated by means of a series of examples and comparative examples. All examples are supportive of the scope of claims. The invention, however, is not restricted to the specific embodiments as shown in the examples. Standard Resin synthesis The diols, diacids and/or anhydrides, optionally inhibitor and catalyst were charged in a vessel equipped with a packed column, a temperature measurement device and inert gas inlet. The mixture was heated slowly by usual methods to 200 °C. The mixture was kept at 200 °C until the distillation of water stopped. The packed column was removed and the mixture was kept under reduced pressure until the acid value reached a certain value. Then the vacuum was relieved with inert gas, and the mixture was cooled down to 130 °C or lower. The solid UP resins were obtained in this way. Next the solid resin was dissolved in a reactive diluent at temperatures below 80 °C. Monitoring of curing Curing was monitored by means of standard gel time equipment. This is intended to mean that both the gel time (Tgel or T25->35°C) and peak time (Tpeak or T25->peak) were determined by exotherm measurements according to the method of DIN 16945 when curing the resin with the peroxide as indicated. Mechanical property determination For the determination of mechanical properties 4 mm castings were prepared. After 16 hrs the castings were released from the mould and postcured using 24hr at 60 °C followed by 24hr at 80 °C. Mechanical properties of the cured objects were determined according to ISO 527-2. The Heat Distortion Temperature (HDT) was measured according to ISO 75-A. The viscosity of the dissolved resin was determined at 23°C using a physica instrument. Barcoll hardness was determined according to DIN EN59. Examples 1-2 and comparative experiments A-C Resins were prepared via the standard synthesis procedure using 732g itaconic acid, 471 g 1,2-propylene glycol and 100ppm 2-methyl hydroquinone. The synthesis of the resin was continued until the acid values listed in table 1 were reached. If applicable the resins were cured after dilution (with 35 wt.% styrene) using 0.5wt% of a cobalt solution (NL-49P) followed by 2wt% Trigonox 44B as peroxide.

Comparative experiments F-H The resin synthesis as described in examples 1, 2 and 3 of WO-A-9727253 was repeated resulting in unsaturated polyesters comprising itaconate esters as reactive unsaturations with the following acid value (mg KOH/g resin), hydroxyl value (mg KOH/g resin) and molar ratio of hydroxyl end groups and carboxylic acid end groups. : Resin example 1 of WO-A-9727253 (comparative experiment F): acid value = 7.6; hydroxyl value = 61; molar ratio = 8.03Resin example 2 of WO-A-9727253 (comparative experiment G): acid value = 42; hydroxyl value = 0; molar ratio = 0Resin example 3 of WO-A-9727253 (comparative experiment H): acid value= 73; hydroxyl value = 0; molar ratio = 0 The obtained resins were diluted in styrene and cured after dilution (with 35 wt.% styrene) using 0.5% of a cobalt solution (NL-49P) followed by 2% Trigonox 44B as peroxide, and castings were made. The castings were extremely brittle. The casting as obtained in Comp Ex F and H (both containing 35 wt.% styrene) were so brittle that mechanical properties could not be determined. The resin of example 2 of WO-A-9727253 (comparative experiment G) has to be diluted further to 52 wt.% styrene in order to obtain a viscosity which allows to make a casting. This casting was too brittle to be able to measure tensile properties and the flexural strength was only 30 MPa. These comparative experiments clearly demonstrate that unsaturated polyesters known in the literature comprising itaconate esters as reactive unsaturations and either an acid value and/or molar ratio outside the claimed range did not result in resin compositions which can be used for construction purposes. Example 3 and 4 Resins were prepared via the standard synthesis procedure with the listed ingredients in table 3. The resins were cured using 0.5 wt.% of a cobalt solution (NL-49P) followed by 2 wt.% Trigonox 44B as peroxide. The curing was monitored with the gel time equipment.
