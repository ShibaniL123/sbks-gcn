Comparative Example 5: Synthesis of racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.monopropionate
Toluene solution (21.00 g) containing racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine (3.00 g: 23.8 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and propionic acid (1.75 g: 23.6 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.monopropionate (2.17 g: 10.8 mmol, yield=46%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 109° C., 160° C.
