Step 3
Dimethyl 2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl-3,3'-dicarboxylate (14)
To a stirred solution of methyl 3-bromo-2-chlorobenzoate (3 g, 12.09 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane at room temperature were added methyl 2-chloro-3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzoate (5.3 g, 18.14 mmol), K2CO3 (3.3 g, 24.18 mmol) and H2O (5 mL) and degassed with argon for 5 min, prior to the addition of Pd(PPh3)4(0.837 g, 0.72 mmol). The resulting mixture was maintained at 100° C. for 16 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with water (50 mL), and extracted with ethyl acetate (3×35 mL). The combined organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude product was purified on a silica gel column, eluting with ethyl acetate in pet-ether (5:95) to afford dimethyl 2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl-3,3'-dicarboxylate (2.8 g, yield: 70%, LC-MS 89.2%) as an off-white solid.
