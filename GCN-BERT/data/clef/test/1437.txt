Step 7: Preparation of (S)-4-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one
50 mg (0.176 mmol) of 4-hydroxy-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one prepared in step 5 and step 6 was dissolved in 2 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile, to which 101 mg (0.229 mmol) of (benzotriazole-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) and 39 μL (0.264 mmol) of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-7-undecene (DBU) were added, followed by stirring for 30 minutes. 58 mg (0.194 mmol) of (S)-2-(1-aminoethyl)-5-chloro-3-phenylquinazoline-4(3H)-one was added thereto, followed by stirring at 60° C. for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered under reduced pressure. Ethyl acetate and water were added thereto, followed by extraction. The extracted organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (5i0 2, eluent: hexane/ethylacetate, 6/1-hexane/ethylacetate, 1/1) to give 72 mg of the target compound (S)-4-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one as a yellow solid (0.127 mmol, yield: 50%).
