LIQUID PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION OF ADALIMUMAB RELATED APPLICATIONS This appl ication is related to Indian Provisional Application 1 248/ UM/2014 filed 02nd Apr, 2014 and is incorporated herein in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a l iquid pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti-TNFct antibody, buffer, sugar, and surfactant. BACKG ROUND OF THE INVENTION Tumor necrosis factor is a polypeptide cytokine involved in inflammation and the acute phase response. TNF-alpha is present in larger quantities in persons with rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease. It is also involved i Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), Psoriatic Arthritis (PA), Ankylosing Spondyl itis (AS), Ulcerative Col itis and Plaque Psoriasis. Direct inhibition of TNF-alpha by the biological agents has produced signi ficant advances in rheumatoid arthritis and other auto-immune disease treatment and has validated the extra-cell ular inhibition of this pro-inflammatory cytokine as an effective therapy. One such biological agent is Adalimumab. Adalimumab (Anti-TNFa antibody), marketed as HUMIRA® by Abott Inc., is a recombinant human IgG l monoclonal anti body speci fic for human tumor necrosis factor (TN F). Adal i mumab, was created usi ng phage display technology resulting in an anti body with human deri ved heavy and l ight chai n variable regions and human IgG l constant regions. Adalimumab is prod uced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell expression system and is purified by a process that includes specific Viral inactivation and removal steps. It consists of 1330 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kilodaltons. " General ly, proteins have a very short half-li fe, and undergo clenaturation (such as aggregation, dissociation, and adsorption on the surface of vessels) upon exposure to various factors such as unfavorable temperatures, water-air interface, high-pressure, physical/ mechanical stress, organic solvents and microbial contamination. Consequently, the denatured protein loses intrinsic physicochemical properties and physiological activity. Denaturation of proteins is often irreversible, and therefore proteins, once denatured, may not recover their native properties to the initial state. In the biopharmaceutical industry, the long term storage o f protei ns, prepared usin recombi nant DNA techno log is generally a difficult task. To overcome the stability problem of proteins in aqueous formulations, therapeutic protein products are made more stable via lyophilization (freeze-drying). Lyophilized products are usually accompanied by sterile aqueous media for reconstitution. After reconstitution, the formulations typically have short useful storage lives, even when stored at low temperatures (e.g., 5°C). Example of TNF alpha inhibitors which are available in the market in the lyophilized form are Enbrel® and Remicade® and both the compositions should be reconstituted before use. Typical practices to improve polypeptide stability can be addressed by varying the concentration of elements with the formulation, or by adding excipients to modify the formulation. US5580856 discloses the stabilization of dried proteins against loss of biological activity in the formulations by adding a reconstitution stabi l izer upon rehydration of the dried protein. A kit for producing a formulation by dissolving the dried composition i n a solvent contain i ng the reconstitution stabil izer is also described. L S61 7 1586 discloses a stable : aqueous pharmaceutical formulation comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody not subjected to prior lyophilization, a buffer maintaining the pH in the range from about 4.5 to about 6.0, a surfactant and a polyol, along with uses for such a formulation. EP 1314437 relates to an invention of stabilized preparations containing an antibody in a glycine buffer and/ or a histidine buffer and also provides processes for preparing a protein-containing stabilized preparation, comprising adj usting the pH with a basic amino acid or a basic amino acid derivative or a salt thereof. EP 1478394 discloses about the invention that relates to an aqueous pharmaceutical composi tion suitable for long-term storage of polypeptides containing an Fc domain of an immunoglobul in, methods of manufacture, methods of administration and kits containing same. US8216583 disclose formulation of human antibodies for treating TNF-a associated disorder. The antibody claimed in the invention is adal imumab. It discloses a l iquid aqueous pharmaceutical formu lation is descri bed which has a h igh protei n concentration, a pH of between about 4 and about 8, and enhanced stability. : US8420081 discloses an aqueous formulation comprising water and a protein, and methods of making the same. The invention is directed towards the findings that proteins formulated in water maintain sol ubi l ity, as well as stability, even at high concentrations, during long-term l iquid storage or other processi ng steps, such as freeze/thawi ng and lyoph i l i zation. Hence, there is a need for a stable aqueous pharmaceutical formulation with an extended shel f life, comprising an antibody which is suitable for therapeutic use to inh ibit or counteract detrimental TNFa activity. There is also a need for a stable aqueous pharmaceutical formulation with an extended shelf life, comprising an antibody suitable for therapeutic use which is easily administered and contains a high protein concentration. · OBJECT OF TH E INVENTION The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel and stable pharmaceutical composition of anti-TNFa antibody along with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following definitions are provided to facil itate understand ing of certain terms used throughout the specification. The present invention relates to a liquid pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti-TNFa antibody, buffer, sugar, and surfactant. The term "human TNFa" (which may be abbreviated as hTNFa, or simply hTNF), as used herei n, is intended to refer to a human cytokine that exists as a 1 7 kD secreted form and a 26 kD membrane associated form, the biologically active form of which is composed of a trimer of noncovalently bound 17 kD molecules. Treatment with anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (infliximab, adalimumab and certoiizumab pegol) has been shown to provide substantial benefit to patients through reductions in both localized and systemic expression of markers associated with inflammation. The present invention relates to a novel and stable pharmaceutical com position comprisi ng adal imumab (o f anti-TNFa antibody), buffer, stabi lizer and surfactant having H range of 4.5 to 6.5. Adalimumab is the first phage-display-deri ved human antibody brought into the clinic, and was generated by 'guided selection' using a mouse monoclonal antibody. (Jespers L. S., Biotechnology 12, 899-903, 1994). Adal imumab (Anti-TNFa antibody), marketed as HUMIRA® by Abott Inc., is a recombinant human IgG l monoclonal antibody speci fic for human tumor necrosis factor (TNT). Adalimumab was created using phage display technology resulting in an antibody with human derived heavy and light chain variable regions and human IgGl constant regions. Adalimumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell expression system and is purified by a process that includes specific viral inactivation and removal steps. It consists of 1330 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kilodaltons. In the present i nvention, buffers are requi red for maintai ning pH o f the formulation . The bu ffer system of the present invention comprises glycine, acetate, arginine, succinate, histidine either alone or a combination thereof giving desired pFI range from 4.5 to 6.5. In one embodiment, stabilizers used in the present invention are selected from the group that consists of: sugar or polyol stabil izer selected from the' group consisting of monosaccharide such as gl ucose and mannose, and the like either alone or in combination thereo f, dissacharides such as sucrose, trehalose, and maltose, and the l i ke either alone or in combination thereof, sugar alcohols such as mannitol and xyl itol, and the like either alone or in combination thereof. In the present invention, surfactant is used in order to prevent adsorption of antibody on the surface of the vial, ampoule, carpoule, cartridge or syringe. Surfactants lower surface tension of a protein solution, thereby, preventing its adsorption or aggregation on to a hydrophobic surface. Preferred surfactants of the present invention incl ude a polysorbate based non-ionic surfactant and polyoxyethylene copolymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone, either alone or in combination. The novel aqueous pharmaceutical composition of anti-TNFcc antibody described in the present invention has the fo 1 lowing advantages : 1. Involves use of a buffer system which is selected from the group consisting of glycine, acetate, arginine either alone or a com bination thereof mai ntains the pH of" the formulation between 4.5 to 6.5, more preferably between 5.0 to 6.0 and also mai ntains the purity o f the formulation at elevated temperature. 2. Involves use of surfactant to prevent adsorption of anti-TNFcc antibody on container. 3. Involves use of a stabilizer which provides better stability. 4. The pharmaceutical composition of present invention is maintained at pH between 5.0 to 6.0 which is critical in maintaini ng the purity and stabil ity of the aqueous composition at elevated temperatures duri ng storage. 5. Involves operational simplicity. The specific embodiments described herein are offered by way of example only, and the invention is to-be limited by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such clai ms are entitled. ' Example 1 Screening and selection of buffer Table 1 : Formulation com position Method of preparation: Adalimumab formulation was prepared in fonnulation composition given in the above table by dissolving the excipients in water for injection. The protein concentration was set to 50 mg/ mL and the pH of the fonnulation is set to 5.2 similar to the reference formulation. 0.8 mL solution filled in 2 mL USP type 1 vial and sealed with coated bromobutylated rubber stopper and aluminum seal. Fil led vial were charged at 40 °C for 1 5 days stress stability study. During stabi l ity study fol lowi ng test were done: Table 2: Pur ose of the tests Stress stability data (14 clay at 40 °C) for selection of buffer a) Physical appearance: All the samples were observed to be clear and colorless till 14 Day at 40 °C for ST. b) pH: Table 3: H of Formulation I, 2 & 3 c) CEX- HPLC: on exchange chromatography separates analytes based on differences in the surface charge of the molecules and their concomitant varying strengths of interaction with the stationary phase. Charge-related variants expected in Molecule and their variability during storage. Propac WCX-10 column from Thermo Scientific was used on Agilent HPLC. Tabic 4: CEX clntii of Formulation I, 2 & 3 Fi ure - 1 Observation: Based on 14 days stress data the purity of the formulation 1, 2 and 3 was comparable with the reference formulation (generic DP). Results are shown in Figure I. cl) SILC-HPLC: Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is size based separation of molecules. High molecular weight and low molecular weight related variants (HMWs and LMWs) can be resolved and detected using this technique. TSK G3000SWXL (7.8 mm x 300 mm) column from Tosoh Haas was used on Agilent HPLC. Observation : Formulation ] , 2 and 3 al l shows less H VV and LM W compared to the reference formulation (Generic DP). Results are shown in Figure 2. e) Relative potency: The biological activity of Adalimumab is determined by cell based in-vitro bio-assay. The assay is based on the neutral ization of cytotoxic effect of TNF-rx on L929 (mouse connect! ve tissue) cel l line expressing TN F receptor I (T F 1 ). Adal imumab speci fical ly neutral izes the cytotoxic activity of TNF-a in a dose dependent manner. Observation: There is no change in potency at 40°C after 14 days as compared to initial in all Formulation. Di fferential Scann ing Calorimetry: DSC measures the difference in heat energy uptake between a sample solution and appropriate reference "(buffer/solvent) with increase in temperature. The transition temperatures Tm (where 50% of protein is in folded form, while 50% in unfolded) is indicator of protein stability. Samples were analyzed on DSC (MicroCal, LLC Mlcrocalorimeter, Model No. : VP-DSC). The scan rate was set to 60 C/h and the protein concentration o f the samples loaded was 0.5 mg/m L. Observation: The thermo gram of generic DP shows the down fall signal which is exothermic in nature and denote the aggregation of the protein at that temperature. Hence it can be said that the protein in the generic formulation matrix is susceptible to the aggregation. Formulation 1, 2 and 3 shows good thermal stability as compared to the generic formulation and Tml and Tm2 shows the higher value for all three formulation as compared to generic formulation. Based on the DSC results it can be predict that the protein (Adalimurnab) will be more stable at long term in test formulation I, 2 and 3 as compared to generic formulation. This can also be seen when correlated with the stress stability data. Results are shown in Figures 3 to 6. Exam le 2 Stability test of Adalimurnab aqueuos thermostable formulation Rationale: Based on the above data, all three buffer shows a good buffering capacity, and thermo stability profile.
