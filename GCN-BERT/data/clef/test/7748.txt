Field of Invention This invention is a novel pharmaceutical composition comprising dabigatran or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt in a combination with a H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. More specifically, this invention relates to pharmaceutical composition comprising dabigatran or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in combination with a H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) for use in the antithrombotic treatment with preventing or reducing the risk of a gastrointestinal disorder administrated by oral, parenteral, intramuscular or topical route. Background of Invention Thrombotic disorders are characterized by formation of a thrombus that obstructs vascular blood flow locally or detaches and embolizes to occlude blood flow downstream. Thrombotic disorders are a major cause of death in the industrialized world. Presently there are numerous antithrombotic drugs which are widely available, they also called as Direct Thrombin Inhibitors (DTIs) which are a class of medication that act as anticoagulants (delaying blood clotting) by directly inhibiting the enzyme thrombin. In another exemplary embodiment, the DTI is univalent. In another exemplary embodiment, the DTI is bivalent. In an exemplary embodiment, the DTI is a member selected from hirudin, bivalirudin (IV), lepirudin, desirudin, argatroban (IV), dabigatran, dabigatran etexilate (oral formulation), melagatran, ximelagatran (oral formulation but liver complications) and pro-drugs thereof. Dabigatran etexilate (Formula I), which is already known from WO 98/37075, is a direct thrombin inhibitor indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-vascular atrial fibrilation. Formula I: Dabigatran etexilate The methane sulphonic acid addition salt of dabigatran etexilate, which is commercially available under the trade name PRADAXA®, is disclosed in EP1870100, also disclosed, pellet composition of dabigatran etexilate mesylate (Formula II). This composition is formulated with a core material consisting of organic acid and an active layer which encloses the core. Formula II: Dabigatran etexilate mesylate Apart from the mesylate salt of dabigatran etexilate, other acid addition salts of the compound are provided in prior art. For example, WO2012/077136 is directed to the oxalate salt of dabigatran etexilate and besides, its hydrochloride salt is identified in EP1877395. These various form of dabigatran etexilate are prepared to facilitate the development of pharmaceutical composition. An active agent should meet some physicochemical requirements in order to be capable of being used in pharmaceutical compositions. These requirements considerably depend on the physicochemical properties of the active agent used in pharmaceutical composition. However, dabigatran etexilate is associated with side effects. The administration of antithrombotic agents, such as dabigatran etexilate, have been associated with gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, the administration of dabigatran etexilate, may make some patients more susceptible to the ulcerogenic effects of ulcerogenic stimuli. It appears that a major factor contributing to the development of these gastrointestinal disorders is the presence of acid in the stomach and upper small intestine. While the mechanisms associated with ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding are not entirely known, there are many causes of ulcers, including stress, alcohol irritation, Helicobacter pylori infection, and the side effects of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients in need of long term antithrombotic drug therapy often may interrupt or not receive such therapy due to gastrointestinal disorders, and as a result, patients are deprived of beneficial antithrombotic drug therapy. There is a need for oral pharmaceutical combination formulations to reduce or eliminate the gastrointestinal disorders associated with use of antithrombotic drugs. H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA) are competitive, reversible inhibitors of the action of histamine at the histamine H2-receptors found in gastric cells. This results in decreased gastric acid secretion and gastric volume, and reduced hydrogen ion concentration. The acid labile compounds are useful for inhibiting gastric acid secretion. Famotidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production. Chemical structure of famotidine (3-[[2-(diaminomethylideneamino)-1,3-thiazol-4-yl]methylsulfanyl]-N'-sulfamoylpropanimidamide) is illustrated with Formula III given below. In prior art, US Patent Numbers US4362736 discloses the compound of famotidine. US Patent Numbers US4283408 discloses the medical composition containing famotidine as a gastric acid secretion inhibitor with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents. Famotidine is commercially available under the trade names PEPCIDINE and PEPCID®. Nizatidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist with low toxicity that inhibits stomach acid production and gastric acid secretion. Chemical structure of nizatidine (N-(2-[(2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]thiazol-4-yl)methylthio]ethyl)-N-methyl-2-nitroethene-1,1-diamine) is illustrated with Formula IV given below. In prior art, US Patent Numbers US4777260 discloses the process for preparing a novel intermediate for nizatidine. US Patent Numbers US4375547 discloses the compound of nizatidine for inhibiting gastric acid secretion in mammals. Nizatidine is commercially available under the trade names TAZAC and AXID®. Ranitidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production. Chemical structure of ranitidine (N-(2-[(5-[(dimethylamino)methyl]furan-2-yl)methylthio]ethyl)-N'-methyl-2-nitroethene-1,1-diamine) is illustrated with Formula V given below. In prior art, US Patent Numbers US4128658 discloses the compound of ranitidine. Additionally ranitidine brings about an improvement of method of treating a condition mediated through histamine H2-receptors, especially for peptic ulceration. US Patent Numbers US5008256 discloses the compound of ranitidine bismuth citrate for treating or preventing gastrointestinal disorders. The bismuth citrate of ranitidine is commercially available under the trade name PYLORID®. EP Patent Numbers EP0626381 discloses a process for preparing form 1 ranitidine hydrochloride. The hydrochloride salt of ranitidine is commercially available under the trade name ZANTAC®. As described above, the major factor contributing to the development of gastrointestinal disorders is the presence of acid in the stomach and upper small intestine. Therefore, the main object of the invention is administering to a patient an oral dosage form including a combination of an antithrombotic agent and a H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) which can reduce a major factor contributing to the development of gastrointestinal disorder in patients. According to the main object, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is for the prevention gastrointestinal tract from side effects associated with antithrombotic therapy and provide greater antithrombotic effect with the results in a lower incidence of side effects. According to prior inventions dabigatran etexilate in combination with H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA) in particular famotidine or nizatidine or ranitidine have an additive preventive effect in relief of gastrointestinal disorder and provide greater antithrombotic effect with the results in a lower incidence of side effects. According to the formulation of the present invention it is desired to provide a dosage form comprising in combination a therapeutically effective amount of an antithrombotic agent, specifically dabigatran and a H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) specifically famotidine or nizatidine or ranitidine which overcomes above described problems. The main challenges when combining those molecules in the same pharmaceutical form are: (a) to guarantee the physico-chemical compatibility between those different active ingredients and/or between the active ingredients and the excipients used; and(b) to insure the pharmaceutical compatibility between those active ingredients regarding their stability characteristics. When dabigatran etexilate is combined with H2RA specifically ranitidine, famotidine or nizatidine in order to minimize or prevent the side effects of the dabigatran etexilate, these two drug substances must be released, dissolved and absorbed harmoniously. For the efficiency of the formulation, an easy dissolution of both drug substances at a desired time is an important factor. In order to minimize or prevent the side effects of dabigatran etexilate; it is very important for the molecule, in which the molecule is used in combination with the H2RAs to release both drug substances at the desired time.

Another object of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for use in antithrombotic treatment and its use in reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-vascular atrial fibrilation and protecting the gastrointestinal tract from side effects associated with antithrombotic therapy. Here, H2 receptor antagonist decreases acid level of gastric fluid by inhibiting acid secretion, thereby preventing or minimizing such diseases as gastric erosion, peptic ulcer, major upper gastrointestinal system bleedings, alterations in the intestine permeability and inflammation, all of which are caused by dabigatran. In a preferred embodiment said pharmaceutical composition is formulated preferably in the form of tablet or capsule or multilayer tablet comprising etexilate or etexilate mesylate pellets of dabigatran and H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) pellets. According to the pharmaceutical incompatibility problem, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a inert barrier layer which is present in the middle in such a way that it separates dabigatran etexilate and one of the H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) layers and the dabigatran etexilate and H2RA layers are present at the outer or inner part of the inert barrier layer. By the virtue of the inert barrier layer, interaction between the dabigatran etexilate and H2RA molecules is prevented and at the same time H2RA molecule is enabled to remain stable in the dosage form. Moreover, another important reason is that the formulations of the active substances with different release properties can be provided in the same form with inert barrier layer. Thus, dabigatran and H2RA molecules are formulated in a way not to interact, and at the same time it is provided that these molecules remain stable in their own form.
