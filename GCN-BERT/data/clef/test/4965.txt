GRANT INF ORA1ATION Not applicable. 1. INTRODUCTION The present invention relates to biomarkers which may be used to evaluate the likelihood that a rapamycin analog would produce an anti-cancer effect in a subject. As such, these biomarkers may be used in methods of treating cancer patients. 2· BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Targeted therapies, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors such as sunitinib (first line therapy), and mTOR inhibitors such as temsirolimus and everolimus (second line therapy), are standard of care in treating advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC; 1-4). Temsirolimus and everolimus are rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) that inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORCl)5-7. International phase III trials led to their approval for treating kidney cancer, yet only demonstrated modest clinical benefit with median progression free survival (PFS) of 4.9-5.5 months (8-11). However, extended periods of freedom from disease progression with rapalogs have been reported in isolated patients among whom some were refractory to first line antiangiogenic agents (10,12,13). These clinical data raise a testable hypothesis that genomic alterations may dictate clinical response. Hyperactive PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, through its effects on protein synthesis, cell survival, and metabolism, has long been implicated in promoting tumor growth. The serine-threonine kinase mTOR exerts its actions as the enzymatic component of two structurally and functionally distinct multi-protein complexes, mTORCl and mTORC2 (6,7). Therapeutic inhibition of mTORCl is the mechanism of action for rapalogs. Components of the PI3K/mTOR pathway can either act as activators (PI3K, ΑΚΤ, and Rheb) or repressors (PTEN, TSC1, and TSC2) of the mTORCl signaling (14). Functional loss of TSC1 and TSC2 was shown in preclinical models to sensitize tumors to rapalogs (15), and everolimus has been approved for treating subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas and angiomyolipoma in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (16,17). Recent reports have also implicated TSC1 as a tumor suppressor in RCC and bladder cancer patients (18,19). However, the recent elucidation of intra-tumor heterogeneity of kidney cancer challenges the predictability of genomic biomarkers derived from single biopsies (20). 3· SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the use of one or more biomarkers to evaluate the likelihood that a rapamycin analog would produce an anti-cancer effect in a subject. It is based, at least in part, on the results of experiments employing an integrated next-generation sequencing approach to interrogate spatially separated tumor specimens from the same individuals to decipher intra-tumor and intertumor heterogeneity and determine the oncogenomic basis of exceptional therapeutic benefit to rapalogs in kidney cancer patients. These experiments implicated loss of function mutations in TSC1 and/or TSC2 and/or gain-of-function of mTOR in therapeutic responsiveness to rapamycin analogs. Accordingly, in non-limiting embodiments, the present invention provides for assay methods and kits for determining the presence of loss of function mutations in TSC1 and/or TSC2 and/or gain-of-function of mTOR, and methods of using such determinations in selecting a therapeutic regimen for a cancer patient and in methods of treating cancer patients. In particular non-limiting embodiments, a plurality of tumor sites are evaluated and the composite effect of the genetic background on mTOR function is assessed. 4.

Methods of detecting a biomarker which is a nucleic acid include but are not limited to polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization (for example but not limited to Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (“FISH”)), gel electrophoresis, sequencing and sequence analysis, and microarray analysis. A biomarker may be a protein. Methods of detecting a biomarker which is a protein include but are not limited to mass spectrometry techniques, 1-D or 2-D gel-based analysis systems, chromatography, enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), radioimmunoassays (RIA), enzyme immunoassays (EIA), Western Blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry.

Methods of detecting a biomarker which is a chromosome or a chromosome fragment include but are not limited to karyotyping and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). In certain non-limiting embodiments of the invention, a biomarker may be assessed for its effect on mTOR function. For example, the activity of mTOR may be evaluated in a cell, which may or may not be a cancer cell, containing the biomarker. As one non-limiting example, as illustrated in the working examples below, mTOR activity is reflected by phosphorylation of S6K at Τ389. The level of mTOR function in a cell or cells containing the biomarker may be compared to the level of mTOR function in the absence of the biomarker. In certain non-limiting embodiments of the invention, a biomarker may be assessed for its effect on TSC1 and/or TSC2 function. For example, the activity of TSC1 and/or TSC2 may be evaluated in a cell containing the TSC1 or TSC2 biomarker. In a certain non-limiting embodiment, the activity of TSC1 and/or TSC2 may be evaluated by evaluating mTOR function, where the activity of TSC1 and/or TSC2 is/are inversely proportional to the activity of mTOR. The level of TSC1 and/or TSC2 function in a cell or cells containing the TSC1 or TCS2 biomarker may be compared to the level of TSC1 and/or TSC2 function in a cell or cells having a different type of TSC1 or TSC2. A healthy control level of mTOR function (healthy control activity)may be established using a non-cancer cell or cells from a healthy control subject. A healthy control level of TSC1 and/or TSC2 function (healthy control activity) may be established using a non-cancer cell or cells from a healthy control subject. 5.2 TSC BIOMARKERS Tuberous sclerosis 1 protein is denoted TSC1 herein.

EXAMPLE: NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING REVEALS GENOMIC DETERMINANTS OF LONG-TERM RESPONSE TO mTOR INHIBITORS IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED RENAL CELL CARCINOMA As shown in FIGURE 1, among patients treated with rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) only a relatively small subset of patients receive sufficient therapeutic benefit to support long-term use. This group of “long-term responder” patients was selected for further study in hopes of identifying characteristics which could be used to prospectively assess the likelihood of beneficial therapeutic response. FIGURE 2Α and Β show, respectively, characteristics of long-term responders and patients who did not substantially benefit from treatment (“poor responders”). DNA from both long-term responders and poor responders was then subjected to Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (“IMPACT”) analysis, which employs bait for 230 cancer genes panel (FIGURE 3Α, and see 36). Genes of interest to mTOR pathway are enlarged and in bold in FIGURE 3Β. FIGURE 4 presents a summary of results for responders. Three tumor sites (FIGURE 5Β) were analyzed for patient 1, who was diagnosed with clear cell RCC and had a long-term response to temsirolimus. As shown in FIGURE 5Α and C. patient 1 had a single copy of Chromosome 9 and different mutations of TSC1 at different tumor sites (Ρ31 lfs and Q527). Three tumor sites and one metastasis (FIGURE 6Β) were analyzed for patient 2, who was diagnosed with unclassified RCC and had a long-term response to temsirolimus. As shown in FIGURE 6Α and C, patient 2 had a 1580fs mutation in TSC1. Patient 3, diagnosed with clear cell RCC and having a long-term response to everolimus, was found to have a Q781 mutation in TSC1 at two tumor sites of four assayed. Interestingly, the other two sites, while lacking the TSC1 mutation, had a Q2223K mutation in mTOR (FIGURE 7Α-Β. Further study showed that the Q2223K mutation in mTOR resulted in gain-of-function (FIGURE 8Β). This mutation maps in the PI3K domain of mTOR (FIGURE 8D). As shown in FIGURE 9A-D, two tumor sites (FIGURE 9Α) were studied in patient 4, who was diagnosed with unclassified RCC and had a long-term response to everolimus. While no mutations were found, site 1 manifested homozygous loss of TSC2. At site 2, a heterozygous deletion, mutation Q794*, was observed (FIGURE 9D). FIGURE 10 shows a summary of the mutations found and their functional consequences in the various long-term responder patients. As shown in FIGURE 11, there were some mTOR relevant mutations identified in several poor responder patients but the mutations were missense mutations without apparent functional effect. The foregoing data provides plausible oncogenomic causes for the exceptional treatment responses observed in some, but not all patients. It suggests that identification of mutations alone may not be sufficient without consideration of their biologic effects. It also illustrates that despite of intratumoral heterogeneity, targeted therapy can be successful due to clonal convergence within the pathway. The foregoing study was advanced further and the results are presented below in Section 7. 7. EXAMPLE: PATHWAY CONVERGENT EVOLUTION IS A MAJOR DETERMINANT OF TREATMENT RESPONSE TO mTOR INHIBITORS IN KIDNEY CANCER 7.1 MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients. Six RCC cases were retrospectively identified from an institutional database of RCC patients treated with rapalogs at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). All had received either temsirolimus or everolimus as single-agent therapy. Six were selected based on extended therapeutic benefit, evident by treatment duration of > 20 months. We felt this cut-off to be representative of long-term benefit, as the registration trials reported <10% or 0% of patients to be alive and progression-free at 20 months, respectively. As part of our analysis all scans obtained between commencement and discontinuation of rapalogs were retrospectively reviewed by a research radiologist. This protocol was approved by our institutional review board, and all patients had previously provided written consents on an institutional tissue procurement protocol. The access and utilization of the kidney cancer TCGA database for publication were approved by the TCGA Program Office. Samples. All 6 patients underwent nephrectomy prior to the initiation of rapalog therapy and have frozen specimens. Adjacent normal kidney tissue (η=5) or peripheral blood (η=1) were used for reference. To interrogate intratumor heterogeneity, DNA was extracted from FFPE materials of additional regions within the primary tumors (regions marked as R). Regions were chosen by a dedicated genitourinary pathologist based on interregional differences in histopathologic appearance. Furthermore, fresh frozen specimens of metastasis (marked as Ml; patient #2) and a contralateral primary kidney tumor (2 separate tumors marked as Τ1 and Τ2, patient #4) were obtained to determine inter-tumor heterogeneity. Previously archived operative specimens were reviewed by an expert genitourinary pathologist to confirm the diagnosis and to identify separate areas of > 70% tumor content and healthy kidney tissues. Macrodissection was performed for each area of interest, and DNA was extracted using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). DNA was quantified using the Thermo Scientific NanoDropTM 1000 Spectrophotometer and samples with an Α260/Α280 ratio of 1.8-2.0 and concentration of 135 ng/pL or greater were considered acceptable for further analysis. Next-generation sequencing. DNA from tumors and matched normal was subjected to an analysis by two next-generation sequencing platforms. The IMPACT assay (Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets) is a customized targeted-exome capture assay of 230 cancer-associated genes with ultra-deep sequencing coverage (>500x) using Illumina HiSeq 2000. Target-specific probes for hybrid selection were designed as previously described to capture all protein-coding exons of a list of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and components of pathways deemed actionable by targeted therapies. The whole-exome capture assay with standard sequencing coverage (~85x) using the Agilent SureSelect XT HumanAllExon 50Mb was performed. Single-nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions, and copy number alterations (CNA) were interrogated. The IMPACT Assay. Ultra-deep targeted sequencing of key cancer-associated genes was performed using the IMPACT assay (Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets). We designed target-specific probes to capture all protein-coding exons of 230 genes of interest for hybrid selection (Agilent SureSelect or Nimblegen SeqCap) as previously described (21). This list included commonly implicated oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and components of pathways deemed actionable by current targeted therapies (Table 2). Two protocols were followed during the course of the study. For 10 samples, barcoded sequence libraries (Illumina TruSeq) were prepared using 500 ng of input tumor or matched normal DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were pooled at equimolar concentrations (100 ng per library) for a single exon capture reaction (Agilent SureSelect) as previously described (31). For 12 samples, barcoded sequence libraries were prepared using 250 ng of input DNA using a hybrid protocol based on the NEBNext DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs). Manufacturer’s instructions were followed with two substitutions: we used NEXTflex barcoded adapters (Bio Scientific) and HiFi DNA polymerase (Kapa Biosystems). Libraries were pooled at 100 ng per tumor library and 50 ng per normal library for a single exon capture reaction (Nimblegen SeqCap). To prevent off-target hybridization in all capture reactions, we spiked in a pool of blocker oligonucleotides complementary to the full sequences of all barcoded adaptors (to a final total concentration of 10 μΜ). Hybridized DNA was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 to generate paired-end 75-bp reads. Data were demultiplexed using CASAVA, and reads were aligned to the reference human genome (hgl9) using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (32). Local realignment and quality score recalibration were performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) according to GATK best practices (33). We achieved mean exon sequence coverage of 590χ (625χ for all tumor samples). Deep sequencing ensured sensitivity for detecting mutations in multiclonal and stroma-admixed samples and enabled accurate determination of mutation allele frequencies. Sequence data were analyzed to identify three classes of somatic alterations: single-nucleotide variants, small insertions/deletions (indels), and copy number alterations. Single-nucleotide variants were called using muTect and retained if the variant allele frequency in the tumor was >5 times that in the matched normal. Indels were called using the SomaticIndelDetector tool in GATK. All candidate mutations and indels were reviewed manually using the Integrative Genomics Viewer34. The mean sequence coverage was calculated using the DepthOfCoverage tool in GATK and was used to compute copy number as described previously (22). Whole-exome capture sequencing. Between 1.9 and 3 pg of high quality genomic DNA was captured by hybridization using the SureSelect XT HumanAllExon 50Mb (Agilent). Samples were prepared according to the manufacturer instructions. PCR amplification of the libraries was carried out for 6 cycles in the pre-capture step and for 10 cycles post capture. Samples were bar-coded and run on a Hiseq 2000 in a 75bp/75bp Paired end run, using the TruSeq SBS Kit ν3 (Illumina). Two samples were pooled in a lane, the average number of read pairs per sample was 69 million. All reads were aligned to the reference human genome (NCBI build 37.1 hgl9). Exome reads were aligned with BWA 32 which does a gaped alignment for the detection of small indels, as described in below. Samples mapping to the reference genome which mapped uniquely (MAPQ>0) were retained and then converted to SAM format 31 for subsequent analyses and for visualization in the Integrative Genomics Viewer 34. Single nucleotide variants were determined in regions of sufficient coverage. We first removed duplicate reads (using Picard MarkDuplicates) from further analysis, defined here as any read chromosome, start position, strand, and color-space sequence matched another aligned read. Indel realignment, base quality recalibration, variant detection, and variant annotation were performed with the GATK framework (33,35). Specifically, after base quality recalibration for color-space reads, variant detection in exome data was performed with the UnifiedGenotyper. For high-coverage exome experiments, variants were excluded if their variant quality was <30, genotype quality <5, or if they were associated with either homopolymer runs or excessive strand bias. Novel variants, those not previously identified in either dbSNP ver. 132, were required to be derived from basespace reads not duplicated from non-duplicate color-space reads, were not resident exclusively in higher-error base positions (positions 38-50) and had evidence of the variant allele in reads mapping to both strands. Candidate somatic mutations were those with a variant genotype in the tumor and reference genotype in the normal sample with minimum coverage of >10 and 6 reads respectively. Additionally, we required that the tumor variant frequency was >10%, and each variant was detected in 4 or more tumor reads. Our pipeline for small insertion and deletion (indel) detection was as follows. Gapped alignment of exome sequencing reads was performed with BWA. The alignment output was sorted and duplicate reads removed with the Picard pipeline and BAM files created and indexed with Samtools. Interval detection, local realignment, indel genotyping, and post-processing were performed with the GATK framework after base quality recalibration, as described above. Retained indels were those with sufficient quality and coverage and not associated with homopolymer runs of 5bp or greater. Sanger Sequencing. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing for validation was performed for all mTOR pathway mutations using standard techniques with primers provided by the Geoffrey Beene Translational Oncology Core . Plasmids. Plasmids containing cDNA encoding myc-epitope-tagged S6K (pcDNA3-myc-S6K) and Flag-epitope-tagged Wild-type mTOR (pcDNA3-FIag mTOR) were obtained from Addgene (#26610 and #26603). To generate individual mTOR mutations, a corresponding nucleotide change was introduced via QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene), producing pcDNA3-Flag mTOR mutants. The primers used are shown in Table 7. Cell Culture, transfection, and immunoblots. ΗΕΚ293Τ cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, non-essential amino acids, and antibiotics. To assay mTOR activity, pcDNA3-Flag mTOR was transfected alone or with Myc-S6K into ΗΕΚ293Τ cells using Lipofectamine 2000, according to manufacturer instructions (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated as indicated. Lysates were measured for protein concentration (Pierce BCA assay), and equal amounts of protein were resolved by PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting using the following antibodies against phospho-S6Kl(T389), total S6K, phospho-S6 (S235/236), phospho-AKT (S473) (Cell Signaling #9205, #9202, #4858, #9271), β-Α℮ΐπΐ (Sigma, AC-15), Flag (Sigma, M2), and c-Myc (Santa Cruz, SC-40).

The model was built by ΗΜΜΗΜΜ (hidden markov-model) comparison, using the HHpred server (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de) and the x-ray crystal structure of PIK3C3 (pdb: 31s8) as a template. 7.2 RESULTS Long-term rapalog treatment responders identified in the MSKCC kidney cancer database. To probe into the genomic determinants underlying long-term rapalog therapeutic benefits, we searched the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) kidney cancer database and identified patients who (1) underwent nephrectomy prior to receiving systemic therapy for metastatic diseases (η=305) with archived fresh frozen tumors available for analysis, (2) were treated with single agent temsirolimus or everolimus, (3) displayed exceptional disease control (partial response or stable disease > 20 months) on rapalogs, and (4) had received sunitinib previously, yet obtained greater clinical benefit with rapalogs. With such criteria, 6 patients were identified who were on average treated with single agent sunitinib for 9 months followed by rapalogs for 29+ months (Table 1). An integrated next-generation sequencing approach identified genetic mutations involving three core components of the mTORCl signaling pathway. DNA from primary kidney tumors and matched normal kidney tissues or peripheral blood mononuclear cells was subjected to an integrated next-generation sequencing analysis employing two platforms: the IMPACT (Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets; 19,21,22), and WEC (whole-exome capture) assays (FIGURES 17 and 18). With standard sequencing coverage (-100χ), WEC enables us to survey mutational landscapes encompassing all coding exons. On the other hand, the IMPACT assay, a customized targeted-exome capture assay of 230 cancer-associated genes (Table 2) with an ultra-deep sequencing coverage (>500x) provides (5) opportunity to (1) capture genomic events potentially missed by WEC due to tumor impurity and/or heterogeneity, (2) effectively analyze DNA from formalin-fixed paraffmembedded (FFPE) samples, (3) compute copy number alterations (CNA), and (4) establish a platform which, by means of cost and efficiency, shows promise for future adaptation to a clinical test. Single-nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions, and copy number alterations (CNA) were first interrogated with IMPACT on all 6 patients (Table 3) and then with WEC on patients #5 and #6 (Table 4). Pertinent genomic findings are summarized (Table 5) and mutations relevant to our research question were confirmed by orthogonal bidirectional Sanger sequencing (FIGURE 19). Interestingly, this approach identified genetic mutations involving three core components of the mTORCl pathway, i.e., TSC1, TSC2, and mTOR, through distinct mechanisms, in 4 of 6 (67%) patients. Complete functional loss of TSC1 or TSC2. For patient #1, a 58 year-old female, the IMPACT analysis of the primary tumor at region 1 (Rl) revealed a novel somatic TSC1 single nucleotide deletion (Ρ31 lfs*4) (FIGURE 12A, FIGURE 19 and Table 5). Copy number analysis of the tumor revealed a single copy of chromosome 9 where the TSC1 gene resides (FIGURE 12Ε). The frameshift mutation with LOH (loss of heterozygosity) would result in a complete functional impairment of TSC1 in the tumor. For patient #2, a 73 year-old female, the IMPACT analysis of Rl identified another novel somatic TSC1 frameshift mutation (I580fs*7) (FIGURE 12Β). Again a concurrent LOH was observed in this patient (FIGURE 12Ε), indicating a complete functional abrogation of TSC1. For patient #4, a 16 year-old tuberous sclerosis complex 2 male who presented with metastatic disease and multiple (6) primaries of both kidneys, copy number analysis of germline (from peripheral blood) and tumor DNA revealed heterozygous loss of TSC2 in the germline and a bi-allelic TSC2 loss in primary kidney tumor 1 (Tl) (FIGURE 12C and FIGURE 20). Complete functional abrogation of either TSC1 or TSC2 would hyperactivate the mTORCl signaling. An mTOR kinase domain mutation identified in the tumor of patient #3. For patient #3, a 66 year-old male, the IMPACT analysis identified a novel somatic missense mutation of mTOR (Q2223K) at region 1 (Rl) of the primary tumor (FIGURE 12D). Amino acid glutamine at position 2,223 resides in the PI3Krelated kinase domain of mTOR. The presence of a Q2223K mutation in a long-term rapalog responder raises a possibility that missense mutations of mTOR in the kinase domain might induce hyperactivity and yet remain sensitive to rapalogs which bind FKBP12 and then target the regulatory FRB domain. For patients #5 and #6, 60 and 50 year-old females, the IMPACT assay did not detect apparent causative oncogenomics events (Table 3). Furthermore, despite capturing a greater number of mutations, WEC (Table 4) also offered no apparent genetic clues concerning the therapeutic benefit of patients #5 and #6 to temsirolimus. Overall, IMPACT assays alone may be sufficient to evaluate the genetic signature of response to rapalogs. The mTOR (Q2223K) mutant aberrantly activates mTORCl yet remains sensitive to rapamycin. The discovery of an mTOR (Q2223K) mutant in the kidney tumor of patient #3 suggests that this mTOR kinase mutant may aberrantly activate mTORCl yet remain sensitive to (7) rapalogs. To examine whether mTOR (Q2223K) affects the mTORCl signaling, we examined its effect on the threonine 389 phosphorylation of S6K (p70S6 kinase, one of the key substrates of mTORCl). Cells expressing mTOR (Q2223K) displayed stronger S6K phosphorylation than those expressing wild-type mTOR (FIGURE 13 A). The observed hyperactivation by mTOR (Q2223K) mutant persisted over lower serum concentrations (FIGURE 13Β). Importantly, the mTOR (Q2223K) mutant was sensitive to rapamycin as wildtype mTOR (FIGURE 13C). This contrasts with the hypersensitivity of EGFR activating mutants to small molecule ERFR inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib (23), likely reflecting the intrinsic differences between EGFR tyrosine and PI3K/PI3K-like kinases. When exogenous S6K was co-transfected, a process known to augment mTORCl signaling, we further demonstrated the hyperactivity of the mTOR (Q2223K) mutant at low serum and affirmed its sensitivity to rapamycin (FIGURE 13D,E). Of note, the serine 473 phosphorylation of ΑΚΤ, a key post-translational modification mediated by mTORC2, was not enhanced by mTOR (Q2223K), indicating that such mutant has no strong effect on mTORC2 (FIGURE 13D). The lysine substitution of glutamine 2223 of the mTOR kinase domain has created an mTOR that only activates mTORCl but not mTORC2. Modeling of the mTOR (Q2223K) mutation based on the solved PI3K kinase domain structure suggests that the 2,223 glutamine residue locates right next to the ATP binding site of the catalytic domain (FIGURE 13F). Clustered, evolutionarily preserved activating mutations of mTOR in kidney cancer. Our discovery of a hyperactive mTOR (Q2223K) mutant in a long-term rapalog-treated patient suggests that activating mTOR mutations in tumors could be implicative of treatment response to rapalogs. Analysis of the clear cell kidney cancer TCGA database (8)through the cBio Genomics Portal revealed mTOR mutations in 5.4% of examined cases (23/424) (Table 6). Importantly, all of these are missense mutations, and the majority clusters on either the FAT or kinase domain (FIGURE 14Α). Accordingly, we performed functional assessment on most of mTOR mutants identified in TCGA, COSMIC, and MSKCC kidney cancer databases (FIGURE 14A-C). Remarkably, nearly all mutations clustered on FAT or kinase domains exhibited hyperactive mTORCl activity (FIGURE 14Β and FIGURE 16) and were sensitive to rapamycin (FIGURE 14C). The scattered uncommon mutations near the HEAT domains appear to be neutral and likely represent passenger mutations due to the inherent large size of mTOR. Our discovery and subsequent functional validation of clustered hyperactive mTOR mutations in the kidney cancer TCGA database suggests that these are recurrent events in ccRCC. It is highly noteworthy that clusters of activating mTOR mutations around the FAT and kinase domains identified in kidney cancer recapitulate a pattern reported in fission yeast (FIGURE 14Α; 24). Using random mutagenesis screens, they identified and functionally validated a large number of similarly clustered activating mutations in TOR2, the yeast equivalent of mTOR (FIGURE 14Α). Together, we unveiled a preserved structural/functional evolution/selection of mTOR/TOR in human cancer pathology and unicellular biology. Thus far, our cancer genomics based on single biopsies of therapeutic outliers was able to successfully provide logical genetic explanations for observed exceptional response to rapalogs in 4 of 6 (67%) patients. All of these mutations would have led to hyperactive mTORCl signaling. Our findings are in line with the exceptional therapeutic response of imatinib, an Abelson kinase inhibitor, in treating CML bearing the BCR-ABL fusion gene (25), and erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, in treating EGFR mutant lung cancer (23). However, recent reports on the complexity of intra-tumor heterogeneity and the branched clonal evolution of RCC raise concerns about the feasibility of single-biopsy genomics in formulating personalized cancer medicine (26,27). To resolve this conundrum, multiregional IMPACT assays were performed on all available additional specimens (spatially separated regions within the primary kidney tumors and metastatic sites whenever are available; and mainly are formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples) of patients #1 to #4. Additional 9 regions were chosen based on interregional histopathologic differences. Genomic findings are summarized (FIGURE 15A-D and Table 5). Intra-tumor heterogeneity with TSC1 intra-genie mTOR pathway convergent evolution. For patient #1, two additional regions (R2, R3) within the primary tumor were examined. Identical to R1 described above, R2 carried a TSC1 (Ρ31 lfs*4) deletion and a heterozygous loss of chromosome 9 (9-) (FIGURE 15 A). Interestingly, analysis of R3 revealed a different nonsense TSC1 (Q527*) mutation with a concurrent heterozygous loss of chromosome 9 (FIGURE 15 A and FIGURE 21). Hence, two distinct TSC1 loss-of-function mutations were discovered in spatially separated areas within the same primary tumor. This would simultaneously trigger aberrant mTORCl activation at different regions of the same tumor, exemplifying an intra-genie (TSC1) clonal convergent evolution of kidney cancer cells in the same patient. For patient #2, the analysis included 2 additional regions within the primary tumor (R2, R3) and one distant metastasis (Ml). R2, R3, and Ml all harbored the same TSC1 (I580fs*7) mutation and a concurrent LOH through one copy loss of chromosome 9, which are identical to what discovered in R1 (FIGURE 15Β). Matching results across all analyzed specimens support a notion that all examined sites originated from one dominant clone which has a complete functional loss of TSC1. Inter-tumor heterogeneity with TSC2 intra-genie mTOR pathway convergent evolution. For the tuberous sclerosis patient #4, primary tumors of both kidneys (Τ1, Τ2) were analyzed. In addition to the germline heterozygous, chromosomal loss of TSC2 (16ρ+/-), Τ1 and Τ2 harbored distinct genomic events, yet converged on a complete loss of TSC2 function : a large deletion with loss of the 2nd allele of TSC2 in Τ1 (FIGURE 12C), and a nonsense mutation of TSC2 (Q794*) in Τ2 (FIGURE 15D and FIGURE 21), exemplifying an inter-tumor (Τ1 vs. Τ2), intra-genie (TSC2) convergent evolution of kidney cancers in the same patient. Intra-tumor heterogeneity with mTOR gain-of-function and TSC1 loss-of-function inter-genic mTOR pathway convergent evolution. For patient #3 whose kidney tumor region 1 (Rl) carries an mTOR kinase domain activating mutation, three additional sites (R2, R3, R4) within the nephrectomy specimen were analyzed. R2 carries the same mTOR (Q2223K) mutation as Rl (FIGURE 15C). Strikingly, although R3 and R4 carried the same VHL and MLL3 mutations as Rl and R2, consistent with a shared ancestral clone, R3 and R4 tumors contained a loss-of-function TSC1 (Q781*) mutation and a concurrent LOH through chromosome 9-, resulting in a complete functional impairment of TSC1 ((FIGURE 15C and FIGURES 21 and 22). Hence, three distinct mechanisms, including a missense gain-of-function mutation of growth promoting gene (mTOR), a nonsense loss-of-function mutation of tumor suppressor (TSC1), and another loss-of-function of TSC1 through LOH (9-), were employed by spatially separated cancer clones within the same primary tumor to concurrently activate mTORCl. The presence of different ΒΑΡ1 splice site mutations between R1/R2 and R3/R4 not only exemplifies their convergent evolution on ΒΑΡ1 but also supports observed clonal bifurcation (FIGURE 15C). To our knowledge, this represents the first concurrent inter-genic (mTOR and TSC1) pathway convergent evolution (mTORCl activation) discovered in human cancer. 7·3 DISCUSSION Our multiregional IMPACT study revealed complete loss-of-function of either TSC1 or TSC2 in all tumors tested for patients #1, #2, and #4, and the coexistence of complete functional loss of TSC1 and gain-of-function of mTOR (Q2223K) in spatially separated regions of the same primary tumor in patient #3. Additionally, we discovered that a significant number of clustered activating mutations of mTOR exist in kidney albeit to a lesser extent in other cancers (FIGURE 23). Importantly, mTOR (Q2223K) also occurrs in colon cancer (CRC TCGA) and thus represents a recurrent mutation. Altogether, our study not only suggests uncontrolled mTORCl signaling as an important contributor to the pathogenesis of kidney cancer but also discovers logical predictive genomic biomarkers for exceptional rapalog response in kidney cancer. Of note, the mTORCl pathway convergent evolution, through complete functional loss of TSC1 orTSC2, or clustered activating mutations of mTOR discovered in our study, was not present in 5 MSKCC kidney cancer patients whose metastatic cancers progressed within two months despite rapalog treatment (non-responders) (data not shown). Intriguingly,we noticed a heterozygous TSC1 loss in one of the non-responders, suggesting that haploid inactivation of TSC1 alone likely has limited predictive value in kidney cancer. This contrasts with a recent report on bladder cancer where haploid inactivation of TSC1 was reported to correlate with response to everolimus in a 14 patient cohort with a median treatment time of 2.6 (1.8-4.1) months, when a long-term responder (33+ months) carrying an additional NF2 mutation was excluded (19). Since mTOR activating mutations are also present in cancers for which rapalogs are not standard of care (FIGURE 23), it might be prudent to conduct a clinical trial administering rapalogs on selected patients whose tumors carry these pathway convergent mutations. The accumulation of diverged mutations during individual cancer evolution underscores the propensity of given tumors in achieving higher intra-tumor heterogeneity for the greater robustness of cancer cells (28). Our data are in agreement with recent demonstrations of the existence of a significant number of private mutations in separated regions of primary and metastatic kidney tumors, demonstrating the highly heterogeneous nature in genomics of individual kidney cancers (20). Branching evolution of cancers supports a central tenet that in order to achieve sustainable therapeutic benefit with targeted therapy one must identify and interfere with the earliest mutation events. Under such premises, ensuing genetic ramifications would mitigate the applicability of targeted therapeutic agents. Importantly, despite such an inherent predicament, our data based on kidney cancers suggest that specific tumor types might be prone to evolve around cancer type-specific central pathways (29,30) that contain regulatory circuits consisting of multiple genetic constituents. In our case, multiple distinct mechanisms, including various nonsense mutations, LOH through chromosomal loss, and activating mutations, can all be usurped by kidney cancer cells to activate mTORCl, for example the complete loss of TSC1 or TSC2, and the activating mutation of mTOR. Such pathway convergence in turns signals out converged vulnerability of cancers that can be effectively intervened with pathway inhibitors. On a cautionary note, one kidney cancer patient, reported in a recent article, harbored an activating mTOR (L243 IP) mutation in the primary tumor but not metastatic sites (20). This patient progressed after ~7 months of everolimus treatment, explaining the lack of exceptional therapeutic response. Hence, multiple biopsies of tumors at different sites could be advised to discover those converging “Achilles’ Heels”. To visualize this concept for treatment planning, we designate “a braided cancer river” to model cancer of a given patient, which branches to illustrate tumor heterogeneity generated by genetic mutations and merges to depict functional convergence through pathway integration. Lastly, it is tempting to speculate that other cancers may also channel through several key tumor type-specific converging pathways that prevalently operate in given cancer types for their robustness, which at the same time provides unique therapeutic vantage points.

EXAMPLE: PROPERTIES OF mTOR MUTANTS ASSOCIATED WITH THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE TO RAPALOGS Various experiments were performed to explore the properties of identified mTOR mutants. To test the ability of cells carrying mTOR mutations to grow in serum-depleted conditions, Hela cells, transfected with Flag-mTOR constructs bearing various mutations, were cultured either without serum (-) or in the presence of 10% serum (+) for 1 hour. Cellular lysates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis to assess phosphorylation of S6K as a measure of mTOR activity. As shown in FIGURE 24, mTOR mutants associated with therapeutic response to rapalogs were found to be more resistant to serum than wild-type mTOR. Experiments were then performed to test the effect of an ΑΚΤ inhibitor on the activity of mTOR mutants. Hela cells, transfected with Flag-mTOR constructs carrying various mTOR mutations, were cultured in medium with (+) or without (-) 1 μΜ ΜΚ2206, an ΑΚΤ inhibitor for 2 hours. Cellular lysates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis analysis to assess phosphorylation of S6K as a measure of mTOR activity. As shown in FIGURE 25, mTOR mutants associated with therapeutic response to rapalogs were found to be more resistant to ΑΚΤ inhibitor than wild-type mTOR. The ability of rapamycin and INK 128 to inhibit activity of the mTOR mutants was also tested. Transfected Hela cells expressing various mTOR mutants were cultured in medium with (+) or without (-) 25 ηΜ rapamycin or 100 ηΜ INK128 for 2 hours. Cellular lysates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis analysis to assess phosphorylation of S6K as a measure of mTOR activity. As shown in FIGURE 26, mTOR mutants associated with therapeutic response to rapalogs were found to be senstive to rapamycin or to INK 128, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of mTORCl and mTORC2. 9. EXAMPLE: SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF DOUBLE MUTATION The effect of concurrent mutations F188L and L2230V on mTOR activity, as reflected by phosphorylation of S6K, was evaluated. In experiments analogous to those described in the preceding section, cells expressing single or double mTOR mutants were prepared. FIGURE 27Α depicts the level of phosphorylation of S6K in the presence of single F1881L and L2230V mutations. FIGURE 27Β depicts phosphorylation of S6K where both mutations are present (other single mutants shown for comparison), where phosphorylation levels were substantially higher in the double-mutant mTOR expressing cells. This higher level of mTOR activity was further demonstrated by resistance to serum depletion (FIGURE 27C) and was even observed when cells were cultured in phosphate buffered saline (FIGURE 27D), indicative of a high level of activity. 10.
