Electronic Vapour Provision Device -1 - Field The specification relates to electronic vapour provision devices. More particularly, but not exclusively, the specification concerns electronic vapour provision devices such as electronic cigarettes. Background Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field. Electronic vapour provision devices are typically cigarette-sized and function by allowing a user to inhale a nicotine vapour from a liquid store by applying a suction force to a mouthpiece. Some electronic vapour provision devices have an airflow sensor that activates when a user applies the suction force and causes a heater coil to heat up and vaporise the liquid. Electronic vapour provision devices include electronic cigarettes. Summary In an embodiment there is provided an electronic vapour provision device comprising a battery assembly and a vaporiser, wherein the battery assembly comprises a power cell and a computer, the vaporiser is releasably connectable to the battery assembly and the computer comprises a computer processor and a memory; wherein the computer is configured to detect whether the vaporiser is connected to the battery assembly; the battery assembly further comprises a capacitor; and the computer is configured to first charge the capacitor and then detect whether a vaporiser is connected to the battery assembly by measuring whether the capacitor is discharged. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words “comprise”, “comprising”, and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of “including, but not limited to”. - 1a - This has the advantage that the technical interaction between the computer and the vapour provision device enables the computer to distinguish between a vaporiser connected state and a vaporiser non connected state. The device can then be configured accordingly. The computer may be configured to substantially remain in a sleep mode until the vaporiser is connected to the battery assembly. Moreover, the sleep mode may be a low power mode. By remaining in a low power sleep mode the device remains active yet consumes very little power. This has the advantage that the device can be charged, for instance during manufacture, and remain in a sleep mode until purchased and used by a consumer. The device will therefore have sufficient power remaining to be used without first charging the device. This also provides an efficient use of power and minimises energy wastage. The device has a further advantage that it can remain in a low power mode without the additional use of a switch to deactivate and activate. The computer can be configured to enter a connected mode when the vaporiser is connected to the battery assembly. Furthermore, the electronic vapour provision device may use less power in sleep mode than in connected mode. Advantageously, once the vaporiser has been connected, the connected mode is a higher power state to enable a more rapid activation once the device is activated by a user. The computer may be configured to wake from sleep mode after a predetermined sleep time to determine whether the vaporiser is connected to the battery assembly. Moreover, the computer may be configured to re-enter sleep mode if a vaporiser is not connected to the battery assembly. The computer can be configured such that the time between entering consecutive sleep modes when the vaporiser is not connected is less that the sleep time. The device may enter a low power sleep mode, then wake to test connection before quickly re-entering a low power sleep mode. This maintains a low power usage while in a sleep mode and between sleep modes. The sleep time may have a value between 0.5 and 5 seconds. The computer may be configured to enter a sleep mode when the capacitor is not substantially fully discharged. Moreover, the computer may be configured to enter a connected mode when the capacitor is substantially fully discharged. In other words, the computer may be configured to determine that the vaporiser is not connected to the battery assembly when the capacitor is not substantially fully discharged. Furthermore, the computer may be configured to determine that the vaporiser is connected to the battery assembly when the capacitor is substantially fully discharged. The battery assembly can further comprise first and second battery assembly connection terminals, and the vaporiser can comprise first and second vaporiser connection terminals, such that the vaporiser is connected to the battery assembly when the first battery assembly connection terminal is connected to the first vaporiser connection terminal and the second battery assembly connection terminal is connected to the second vaporiser connection terminal; wherein the capacitor is connected in parallel with the first and second battery assembly connection terminals. The battery assembly may further comprise a resistor in series with the capacitor; wherein the capacitor and resistor are in parallel with the first and second battery assembly connection terminals. The computer may be configured to send out a pulse and the capacitor may be charged for a period of time equal to the width of the pulse. The electronic vapour provision device may further comprise a transistor; wherein the pulse is sent to the transistor and the transistor opens the current from the power cell to the capacitor for a period of time equal to the width of the pulse. In another embodiment there is provided a method of detecting connection of battery assembly and a vaporiser of an electronic vapour provision device, wherein the battery assembly comprises a power cell, a processor and capacitor; and the vaporiser is releasably connectable to the battery assembly; the method comprising initially charging the capacitor, then measuring whether the capacitor is discharged. In another embodiment there is provided an electronic vapour provision device comprising a battery assembly and a vaporiser, wherein the battery assembly comprises a power cell and a computer; the vaporiser is releasably-attachable to the battery assembly; the computer comprises a computer processor, a memory and an input-output means; and the computer is configured in use to detect whether the vaporiser is connected to the battery assembly. As used herein, the term vapour includes an aerosol and other fluid streams for provision to a user by the electronic vapour provision device.

Detailed Description Referring to Figures 1 to 3 there is shown an electronic vapour provision device, also referred to herein as an electronic smoking device, that comprises a mouthpiece 2 and a body 4. The electronic vapour provision device is shaped like a conventional cigarette. Both the mouthpiece 2 and body 4 are cylindrical and are configured to connect to each other coaxially so as to form the conventional cigarette shape. The mouthpiece 2 is connectable to the body 4 at a first end of the mouthpiece and has an air outlet 6 at a second end. The body 2 comprises a battery assembly 8, comprising a power cell 10 and a computer 12 on a circuit board 14, wherein the power cell 10 is connected to the computer 12. The computer 12 comprises a computer processor 16, a memory 18 and input-output arrangement 20. In this example the computer 12 is a microcontroller. The computer 12 is configured to control and interface with the other electrical components of the battery assembly 8, comprising the power cell 10, via the input-output arrangement 20. The mouthpiece 2 comprises a liquid bottle 22 and a vaporiser 24 having a heater coil 26. For example, the vaporiser 24 is in fluid communication with the liquid bottle 22. The mouthpiece 2 is connectable to the battery assembly 8 by a screw thread, wherein connection of the battery assembly 8 and the mouthpiece 2 connects a first battery assembly terminal 28 to a first vaporiser terminal 30 and a second battery assembly terminal 32 to a second vaporiser terminal 34, forming an electrically conductive contact in both cases. The vaporiser terminals 30 34 are electrically connected in parallel to the vaporiser 24. The herein described configuration of the computer 12 comprises the computer operating according to a computer program stored in its memory 18 and accessed by its computer processor 16. To maximise the lifetime of the charge in the power cell 10, the computer 12 is configured to detect whether the vaporiser 24 is connected to the battery assembly 8, the connection state, and to enter a low power sleep mode if the vaporiser 24 is not connected. For example, sleep mode may comprise the computer 12 consuming minimal power and performing no processing. A period during which the computer 12 is in sleep mode is herein referred to as sleep time. Furthermore, if the computer 12 determines that the vaporiser 24 is connected, the computer 12 is configured to enter a connected mode, which is of a higher power than the low power mode. Moreover, detecting the connection state may comprise the computer 12 periodically checking whether the vaporiser 24 is connected to the battery assembly 8. If the computer 12 determines that the vaporiser 24 is not attached, the computer 12 goes into sleep mode for two seconds. After the sleep time, the computer 12 wakes and immediately and quickly checks again for a vaporiser connection. Again, if the vaporiser is not connected the computer 12 goes into sleep mode for another two seconds. The time that the computer 12 is awake is extremely short compared to the sleep time so the circuit remains predominantly in a low power mode, thus conserving power. During the sleep time no checks are made to determine whether the vaporiser 24 is connected. A user may take several seconds to assemble the device, connecting the vaporiser 24 and the battery assembly 8, so the vaporiser 24 connection may be easily established by the computer 12 before use of the device by a user. The waking of the computer 12 may for example comprise the computer 12 entering a waking mode distinct from the sleep mode and the connection mode. The computer 12 checking whether the vaporiser 24 is connected to the battery assembly 8 may for example comprise the computer 12 sending an electrical pulse to the battery assembly terminals 28, 32. For example, the computer 12 may control the power cell 10 so as to supply a pulse of current to the first battery assembly terminal 28 and may measure the current reaching the second the battery assembly terminal 32, for example using a digital multimeter of the battery assembly 8. The digital multimeter is reference 44 in the circuit diagram of Fig. 10. Furthermore, if the vaporiser 24 is connected, the digital multimeter reads a current reaching the second battery assembly terminal 32 via the vaporiser 24 and provides information to the computer 12 indicating this. Figures 4 to 6 show another example of an electronic vapour provision device. This device is similar to that shown in Figures 1 to 3, however in this example the vaporiser 24 does not form part of the mouthpiece 2. The mouthpiece 2 contains a liquid bottle 22 and is attachable to the vaporiser 24. The vaporiser 24 has a heater coil 26 and additionally a wick 36. For example the wick 36 may be a mesh wick. The mouthpiece 2 and the vaporiser 24 are configured to connect to each other such that the wick 36 acts to communicate liquid from the liquid container 22 onto the vaporiser 24. The interaction between the vaporiser 24 and the battery assembly 8 to conserve power is as described above. Further examples of how, in the devices of Figures 1 to 6, connection of the vaporiser 24 to the body 4 may be detected by the computer 12 are now described with reference to Figures 7 to 10. Figure 7 shows a battery assembly 8 similar to that shown in Figure 3 and Figure 6, additionally comprising a capacitor 38. The capacitor 38 is arranged in a circuit such that it is in parallel to the battery assembly terminals and to the power cell 10. To test whether the vaporiser 24 is connected to the battery assembly 8, the computer 12 first controls the power cell 10 to charge the capacitor 38, then waits a short time and checks the charge of the capacitor 38. For example, the computer 12 may use a digital mulitmeter of the battery assembly 8, wired in a switched parallel circuit to the capacitor 38, to check the charge of the capacitor 38. For instance, in order to check the charge of the capacitor 38, the computer 12 may trigger the completion of the switched digital mulitmeter circuit and may then receive information from the mulitmeter indicating a voltage across the capacitor 38 resulting from the charge of the capacitor. If the vaporiser 24 is connected, the resistance of the vaporiser 24 causes the capacitor 38 to discharge quickly so the computer 12 measures at least a substantially fully discharged capacitor 38. If the vaporiser 24 is not connected the capacitor is not substantially fully discharged when checked by the computer 12. Figure 8 shows an arrangement similar to that shown in Figure 7, additionally comprising a resistor 40 in series with the capacitor 38. For example, the resistor 40 and the capacitor 38 may be connected in series with each other and in parallel with the first and second battery assembly connection terminals 28 32. The battery assembly 8 of the devices described herein may further comprise an air pressure sensor, wherein the air pressure sensor is powered by the power cell 10 and controlled by the computer 12. Once the vaporiser is connected to the battery assembly 8, and the device enters a connected mode after the computer 12 has determined the device’s connection state, in order to use the device the user must suck on the mouthpiece 2. The electronic vapour provision device is configured such that the user sucking on the mouthpiece 2 causes a drop in air pressure at the air pressure sensor. The computer 12 therefore receives information from the air pressure sensor indicating that a user is sucking on the device. In response to this information, the computer 12 controls the power cell 10 to power the vaporiser 24. For example, the computer may control the power cell 10 to power the vaporiser 24 via the respective first and second terminals of both the battery assembly and the vaporiser. This causes the vaporisation of liquid communicated to the vaporiser 24 from the liquid bottle 22. The provided vapour then passes to the user. Consequently, use of the device by a user comprises the user sucking on the device and the detection of this user interaction by the device so as to trigger the vaporisation of the liquid contained in the device. The pressure sensor is referenced 43 in the circuit of Fig. 10 described in more detail hereinafter. It should be noted that the herein described configuration of the computer 12 to determine whether the vaporiser 24 is connected to the battery assembly 8 does not require use of the device by the user. Figure 9 shows a battery assembly 8, comprising a digital multimeter 44, similar to that described with reference to Figure 7 and 8, further comprising a transistor 42 and the previously described air pressure sensor 43. Figure 10 shows a circuit diagram of the battery assembly of Figure 9. The transistor 42 is connected in series between the power cell 10 and the capacitor 38. In the example shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10, the previously described controlling of the charging of the capacitor 38 by the computer 12 involves the transistor 42. To test whether the vaporiser 24 is connected, the computer 12 sends a square wave pulse to the transistor 42. The transistor 42 supplies current to the capacitor 38 for a period of time equal to the width of the pulse, thereby charging the capacitor 38. For example the transistor 42 may be configured such that it opens a current from the power cell 10 to the capacitor 38 for a period of time equal to the width of the pulse. As described above, if the vaporiser 24 is connected the computer 12 measures at least a substantially fully discharged capacitor 38. With regard to the embodiments described herein, the following alternatives and variations will now be described. The electronic vapour provision devices described may be electronic cigarettes. The sleep time may be substantially 2 seconds. However, the sleep time is not restricted to 2 seconds and other suitable values could be used. Moreover, the time between entering sleep modes can be significantly less than the sleep time. The computer processor 16 can be a microprocessor. Moreover, the computer 12 may comprise a microcontroller. Furthermore, a computer such as a microcontroller could utilise a watchdog timer to implement the sleep time wait in the low power mode. Using a microcontroller has space saving advantages since the entire computer is located on a single chip and therefore the size of the device is minimised. Fewer components to assemble also provides reduced manufacturing times are costs. The computer is not restricted to being a microcontroller and could be fabricated from separate processor, memory and input-output components. The device is not restricted to being cigarette shaped. The vaporiser 24 and the battery assembly 8 may be releasably connectable to each other. The vaporisers 24 described are examples only. Moreover, the sleep mode may be the lowest non-zero power mode of the device. Although an air pressure sensor 43 is described, other configurations may be employed to detect when a user is attempting to use the device. For example, an airflow sensor may be used and the device may be configured such that sucking on the mouthpiece 2 by a user causes a flow of air past the air flow sensor. Although a liquid bottle 22 is described, other types of liquid storage may be used. For example the device may comprise foam partially saturated in liquid for vaporisation. Although a digital multimeter 44 is described as being used by the computer 12 to determine the level of charge of the capacitor, other suitable configurations may be employed for this purpose. For example, a digital voltmeter may instead be used. The pulse provided by the computer may be a square wave pulse.
