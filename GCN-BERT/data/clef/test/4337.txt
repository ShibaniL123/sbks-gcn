Step 2: Preparation of (S)-4-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-(pyridine-3-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one
14 mg of (S)-4-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-(pyridine-3-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one was prepared as a pale yellow solid by using 30 mg (0.053 mmol) of (S)-4-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-(pyridine-3-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one prepared in step 1 according to the same manner as described in step 8 of Example 1 (0.031 mmol, yield: 59%).
