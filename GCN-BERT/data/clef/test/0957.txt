CHIRAL METAL COMPLEXES AS EMITTERS FOR ORGANIC POLARIZED ELECTROLUMINESCENT DEVICES CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION [0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 61/945,940 entitled "CHIRAL METAL COMPLEXES AS EMITTERS FOR ORGANIC POLARIZED ELECTROLUMINESCENT DEVICES" and filed on February 28, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD [0002] This description relates to chiral metal complexes as emitters for organic polarized electroluminescent devices. BACKGROUND [0003] Organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) are a new generation of display technology. As depicted in FIG. 1, a typical OLED 100 includes a layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) as an anode 102, a single layer of hole-transporting materials (HTL) 104, a single layer of emissive materials (EML) 106 including emitter and host, a single layer of electron- transporting materials (ETL) 108 and a layer of metal cathode 1 10. The emission color of OLED is determined by the emission energy (optical energy gap) of emitters. Emitters include phosphorescent emitters, thermal activated delayed fluorescent emitters, and metal- assisted delayed fluorescent emitters. [0004] OLEDs with polarized electroluminescent spectra are desirable for mobile displays or other full color display applications. To enable a high quality of full color displays, a polarizer may be coupled to a transparent electrode of an OLED to filter unwanted reflected light from the background, thereby yielding linearly or circularly polarized light. FIG. 2A depicts a linearly polarized light wave 200. FIG. 2B depicts a circularly polarized light wave 202. This polarizer/OLED arrangement, however, decreases the device efficiency of the OLED by filtering some of the emitted photons. SUMMARY [0005] Chiral metal complex emitters provide various advantages over non-polarized emitters with respect to organic polarized electroluminescent devices. For example, chiral metal complex emitters generate polarized electroluminescent spectra without the use of polarizers, thereby eliminating photon loss due to the polarizers. Specific alignment of chiral metal complex emitters may also reduce the plasmon quenching from the metal electrode and enhance the outcoupling efficiency of the device, thereby allowing more photons to exit the device and resulting in a higher illumination intensity.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0032] The present disclosure can be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description and Examples. [0033] Before the present compounds, devices, and/or methods are disclosed and described, it is to be understood that they are not limited to specific synthetic methods unless otherwise specified, or to particular reagents unless otherwise specified, as such can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not intended to be limiting. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing, example methods and materials are now described. [0034] As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a component" includes mixtures of two or more components. [0035] As used herein, the terms "optional" and "optionally" mean that the subsequently described event or circumstance can or cannot occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not. [0036] Disclosed are the components to be used to prepare the compositions described herein as well as the compositions themselves to be used within the methods disclosed herein. These and other materials are disclosed herein, and it is understood that when combinations, subsets, interactions, groups, etc. of these materials are disclosed that while specific reference of each various individual and collective combinations and permutation of these compounds cannot be explicitly disclosed, each is specifically contemplated and described herein. For example, if a particular compound is disclosed and discussed and a number of modifications that can be made to a number of molecules including the compounds are discussed, specifically contemplated is each and every combination and permutation of the compound and the modifications that are possible unless specifically indicated to the contrary. Thus, if a class of molecules A, B, and C are disclosed as well as a class of molecules D, E, and F and an example of a combination molecule, A-D is disclosed, then even if each is not individually recited each is individually and collectively contemplated meaning combinations, A-E, A-F, B-D, B-E, B-F, C-D, C-E, and C-F are considered disclosed. Likewise, any subset or combination of these is also disclosed. Thus, for example, the sub-group of A-E, B-F, and C- E would be considered disclosed. This concept applies to all aspects of this application including, but not limited to, steps in methods of making and using the compositions. Thus, if there are a variety of additional steps that can be performed it is understood that each of these additional steps can be performed with any specific embodiment or combination of embodiments of the methods. [0037] As referred to herein, a linking atom or group connects two atoms such as, for example, a N atom and a C atom. The linking atom or group can optionally, if valency permits, have other chemical moieties attached. For example, in one aspect, an oxygen would not have any other chemical groups attached as the valency is satisfied once it is bonded to two groups (e.g., N and/or C groups). In another aspect, when carbon is the linking atom, two additional chemical moieties can be attached to the carbon. Suitable chemical moieties include, for example, amine, amide, thiol, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, and heterocyclyl. [0038] The term "cyclic structure" or the like terms used herein refer to any cyclic chemical structure which includes, but is not limited to, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, heterocyclyl, carbene, and N-heterocyclic carbene. [0039] As used herein, the term "substituted" is contemplated to include all permissible substituents of organic compounds. In a broad aspect, the permissible substituents include acyclic and cyclic, branched and unbranched, carbocyclic and heterocyclic, and aromatic and nonaromatic substituents of organic compounds. Illustrative substituents include, for example, those described below. The permissible substituents can be one or more and the same or different for appropriate organic compounds. For purposes of this disclosure, the heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, can have hydrogen substituents and/or any permissible substituents of organic compounds described herein which satisfy the valences of the heteroatoms. This disclosure is not intended to be limited in any manner by the permissible substituents of organic compounds. Also, the terms "substitution" or "substituted with" include the implicit proviso that such substitution is in accordance with permitted valence of the substituted atom and the substituent, and that the substitution results in a stable compound, e.g., a compound that does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, etc. It is also contemplated that, in certain aspects, unless expressly indicated to the contrary, individual substituents can be further optionally substituted (i.e., further substituted or unsubstituted). [0040] In defining various terms, "A1," "A2," "A3," and "A4" are used herein as generic symbols to represent various specific substituents. These symbols can be any substituent, not limited to those disclosed herein, and when they are defined to be certain substituents in one instance, they can, in another instance, be defined as some other substituents. [0041] The term "alkyl" as used herein is a branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon group of 1 to 24 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, w-propyl, isopropyl, n- butyl, isobutyl, s-butyl, ?-butyl, w-pentyl, isopentyl, s-pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, eicosyl, tetracosyl, and the like. The alkyl group can be cyclic or acyclic. The alkyl group can be branched or unbranched. The alkyl group can also be substituted or unsubstituted. For example, the alkyl group can be substituted with one or more groups including, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, amino, ether, halide, hydroxy, nitro, silyl, sulfo-oxo, or thiol, as described herein. A "lower alkyl" group is an alkyl group containing from one to six (e.g., from one to four) carbon atoms. [0042] Throughout the specification "alkyl" is generally used to refer to both unsubstituted alkyl groups and substituted alkyl groups; however, substituted alkyl groups are also specifically referred to herein by identifying the specific substituent(s) on the alkyl group. For example, the term "halogenated alkyl" or "haloalkyl" specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more halide, e.g., fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. The term "alkoxyalkyl" specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more alkoxy groups, as described below. The term "alkylamino" specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more amino groups, as described below, and the like. When "alkyl" is used in one instance and a specific term such as "alkylalcohol" is used in another, it is not meant to imply that the term "alkyl" does not also refer to specific terms such as "alkylalcohol" and the like. [0043] The terms "alkoxy" and "alkoxyl" as used herein to refer to an alkyl or cycloalkyl group bonded through an ether linkage; that is, an "alkoxy" group can be defined as -OA1 where A1 is alkyl or cycloalkyl as defined above. "Alkoxy" also includes polymers of alkoxy groups as just described; that is, an alkoxy can be a polyether such as -OA^OA2 or -OA1- (OA2)a-OA3, where "a" is an integer of from 1 to 200 and A1, A2, and A3 are alkyl and/or cycloalkyl groups. [0044] The term "aldehyde" as used herein is represented by the formula -C(0)H. Throughout this specification "C(O)" is a short hand notation for a carbonyl group, i.e., C=0. [0045] This practice is also used for other groups described herein. That is, while a term such as "cycloalkyl" refers to both unsubstituted and substituted cycloalkyl moieties, the substituted moieties can, in addition, be specifically identified herein; for example, a particular substituted cycloalkyl can be referred to as, e.g., an "alkylcycloalkyl." Similarly, a substituted alkoxy can be specifically referred to as, e.g., a "halogenated alkoxy," a particular substituted alkenyl can be, e.g., an "alkenylalcohol," and the like. Again, the practice of using a general term, such as "cycloalkyl," and a specific term, such as "alkylcycloalkyl," is not meant to imply that the general term does not also include the specific term. [0046] The terms "amine" or "amino" as used herein are represented by the formula - NAXA2, where A1 and A2 can be, independently, hydrogen or alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkynyl, aryl, or heteroaryl group as described herein. [0047] The term "alkylamino" as used herein is represented by the formula -NH(-alkyl) where alkyl is a described herein. Representative examples include, but are not limited to, methylamino group, ethylamino group, propylamino group, isopropylamino group, butylamino group, isobutylamino group, (sec-butyl)amino group, (tert-butyl)amino group, pentylamino group, isopentylamino group, (tert-pentyl)amino group, hexylamino group, and the like. [0048] The term "aryl" as used herein is a group that contains any carbon-based aromatic group including, but not limited to, benzene, naphthalene, phenyl, biphenyl, phenoxybenzene, and the like. The term "aryl" also includes "heteroaryl," which is defined as a group that contains an aromatic group that has at least one heteroatom incorporated within the ring of the aromatic group. Examples of heteroatoms include, but are not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus. Likewise, the term "non-heteroaryl," which is also included in the term "aryl," defines a group that contains an aromatic group that does not contain a heteroatom. The aryl group can be substituted or unsubstituted. The aryl group can be substituted with one or more groups including, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, aldehyde, amino, carboxylic acid, ester, ether, halide, hydroxy, ketone, azide, nitro, silyl, sulfo-oxo, or thiol as described herein. The term "biaryl" is a specific type of aryl group and is included in the definition of "aryl." Biaryl refers to two aryl groups that are bound together via a fused ring structure, as in naphthalene, or are attached via one or more carbon-carbon bonds, as in biphenyl. In some aspects, an aryl group has from 6 to 20 carbons. In some aspects, an aryl group has from 6 to 10 carbons. [0049] The term "cycloalkyl" as used herein is a non-aromatic carbon-based ring composed of at least three carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, norbornyl, and the like. In some aspects, a cycloalkyl group comprises 3 to 20 carbons. In some aspects, a cycloalkyl group comprises 3 to 10 atoms carbons. The term "heterocycloalkyl" is a type of cycloalkyl group as defined above, and is included within the meaning of the term "cycloalkyl," where at least one of the carbon atoms of the ring is replaced with a heteroatom such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, or phosphorus. The cycloalkyl group and heterocycloalkyl group can be substituted or unsubstituted. The cycloalkyl group and heterocycloalkyl group can be substituted with one or more groups including, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, amino, ether, halide, hydroxy, nitro, silyl, sulfo-oxo, or thiol as described herein. In some aspects, a heterocycloalkyl group comprises from 4 to 10 atoms (e.g., C, N, S, and O). In some aspects, a heterocycloalkyl group comprises 4 to 10 atoms (e.g., C, N, S, and O). [0050] The term "carboxylic acid" as used herein is represented by the formula -C(0)OH. [0051] The term "ester" as used herein is represented by the formula -OC(0)A1 or - C(0)OA1, where A1 can be alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkynyl, aryl, or heteroaryl group as described herein. The term "polyester" as used herein is represented by the formula -(A10(0)C-A2-C(0)0)a- or -(A10(0)C-A2-OC(0))a-, where A1 and A2 can be, independently, an alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkynyl, aryl, or heteroaryl group described herein and "a" is an integer from 1 to 500. "Polyester" is as the term used to describe a group that is produced by the reaction between a compound having at least two carboxylic acid groups with a compound having at least two hydroxyl groups. [0052] The term "ether" as used herein is represented by the formula AxOA2, where A1 and A2 can be, independently, an alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkynyl, aryl, or heteroaryl group described herein.

[0083] In some aspects, the chiral metal complex disclosed herein is selected from the group consisting of: Light Emitting Devices [0084] The compounds disclosed herein are useful in a variety of applications. As light emitting materials, the compounds can be useful in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), luminescent devices and displays, and other light emitting devices. [0085] Opto-electronic devices that make use of organic materials are becoming increasingly desirable for a number of reasons. Many of the materials used to make such devices are relatively inexpensive, so organic opto-electronic devices have the potential for cost advantages over inorganic devices. In addition, the inherent properties of organic materials, such as their flexibility, may make them well suited for particular applications such as fabrication on a flexible substrate. Examples of organic opto-electronic devices include organic light emitting devices (OLEDs), organic phototransistors, organic photovoltaic cells, and organic photodetectors. For OLEDs, the organic materials may have performance advantages over conventional materials. For example, the wavelength at which an organic emissive layer emits light may generally be readily tuned with appropriate dopants. [0086] Chiral emitters described herein generate circularly polarized electroluminescent emission. OLEDs that comprise said chiral emitters in the emissive materials layer (EML) provide circularly polarized electroluminescence without the use of polarizers and the accompanying loss of efficiency. [0087] Circularly polarized emission is generated when greater than 50 wt% or mol% of the emissive material in the emissive materials layer (EML) is a selected single enantiomer or a selected single diastereomer of the chiral metal complex emitters of general formulae (1)- (4). In some aspects, greater than 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, or 99 wt% or mol% of the emissive material in the emissive materials layer is a selected single enantiomer or a selected single diastereomer of the chiral metal complex emitters of general formulae (l)-(4). In some aspects, greater than 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, or 99 wt% of the emissive material in the emissive materials layer is a selected single enantiomer or a selected single diastereomer of the chiral metal complex emitters of general formulae (l)-(4). In some aspects, greater than 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, or 99 mol% of the emissive material in the emissive materials layer is a selected single enantiomer or a selected single diastereomer of the chiral metal complex emitters of general formulae (l)-(4). The chiral metal complex emitters in the emissive materials layer may be present as a single chiral structure, an isomeric mixture, or two or more different chiral metal complexes. In some aspects, the chiral metal complex emitter in the emissive materials layer is present as a single chiral structure. In some aspects, the chiral metal complex emitter in the emissive materials layer is present as an isomeric mixture. In some aspects, two or more different chiral metal complexes are present in the emissive materials layer.
