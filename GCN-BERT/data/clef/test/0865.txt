CHOLINE-BASED CROSSLINKER COMPOSITIONS FOR FRACTURING FLUIDS FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention relates to solutions and/or suspensions containing crosslinking agents in an aqueous brine of choline salts and is applied as a time released crosslinker for polymer solutions, methods of using these compositions, and methods of preparing the compositions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Fracturing, or hydraulic fracturing, involves the injection of specialized fluids into geologic formations to create fractures. These fractures, in combination with flow paths drilled by wellbores, allow hydrocarbons, such as oil or natural gas, to flow from the deep recesses of the geologic formations to the ground surface. The injected specialized fluids are called fracturing fluids, which carry proppant into the fractures. [0003] For many years, fracturing fluid technology has centered on a wide range of polymers. Polysaccharides such as guar, hydroxypropyl guar (HPG) and hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) are the most commonly used polymers to provide the fluid viscosity. Since high viscosities are needed to carry the required amount of proppant, high concentrations of polymer are used and the polymers are frequently crosslinked to achieve the necessary viscosity. Cross-linked polymer gels, such as those based on guar crosslinked with borate or other polymers crosslinked with metal ions, are typically used to attain a sufficient fluid viscosity and thermal stability in high temperature reservoirs. [0004] The crosslinking agents for polysaccharide solutions used in well treating fluids are well known in the art. One common type of crosslinker is transition metal containing compounds including titanium (4+), zirconium (4+), chromium (3+), iron(3+) and aluminum (3+) formulated as a product so as to release transition metal ions when dissolved in an aqueous liquid. The most commonly used crosslinker is based on borate releasing compounds due to its reversibility of crosslinking. The borate source may include easily soluble borate oxides such as boric acid and/or sodium borate (borax). The borate source can also be lowly soluble borate minerals such as ulexite, colemanite, probertite, and mixtures thereof. Products of this type have a technical advantage of delayed crosslinking action upon use, which is a desired property for many fracturing applications, and is a consequence of the low solubility. The borate source can also be a mixture of lowly soluble borate minerals and/or boric acid and/or ester derivatives of boric acid and/or borax and/or alkali borate salts and/or alkali earth borate salts. [0005] In order to add borate or metallic crosslinkers easily and accurately into the fracturing fluids, it is better for the crosslinker to be in a liquid form. In many cases, it is advantageous to have highly concentrated formulations with actives present in excess of their solubility limits, typically dispersed as a suspension of the particular active in an appropriate liquid suspension medium. One common medium is ηοηaqueous liquids such as hydrocarbon solvents. See US 6,024,170, which is incorporated fully herein by reference. [0006] Numerous problems exist when utilizing non-aqueous suspensions. Many of the non-aqueous liquid suspensions are environmentally unacceptable due to the choice of the oil and have poorer suspension and stability characteristics, and may be more expensive and difficult to prepare. [0007] US 2003/0144154 Al, which is fully incorporated herein by reference, discloses a concentrate for the crosslinking of polymers in aqueous solutions, which comprises an alkali metal formate solution, a crosslinking agent, a suspension agent, and optionally a deflocculant. The preferred alkaline metal formate is potassium formate. The preferred suspension agent is a clay mineral selected from the group consisting of smectite clays, palygorskite clays and mixtures thereof. The key of this technology is the addition of formate salt, which decreases the freezing point of the product and increases the density of the suspension. Under this technology, however, clay minerals are also required. [0008] Solutions of low molecular weight quaternary ammonium compounds have also been used in hydraulic fracturing fluids for their clay stabilizing properties, in which the presence of this type of ion helps prevent the swelling of clay minerals present in the subterranean formation, which come into contact with water as a result of the fracturing operation. Clay swelling and associated fines migration leads to reservoir permeability damage. Tetramethyl ammonium chloride is the historically most used substance in this category, but the natural product choline in the form of its chloride salt has in recent years become the product of choice because of its inherently non-toxic and bio-assimilation properties. [0009] A perhaps lesser appreciated property of choline chloride is the high water solubility (70-75 weight % are typical solution concentrations) and corresponding high solution density and low freezing point. This makes choline chloride solutions ideal media for suspension of dense materials such as sparingly soluble borate minerals and metal ions. Another feature of choline is the hydroxyl functionality, which will react with soluble borate species to yield borate esters. This enables the choline solutions to co-solubilize borate in high percentages and still to retain the desired pour point and pumpability of the overall fluid. Such solutions would advantageously combine multiple fuctions, i.e. clay stabilization and crosslinker actives, into one easily managed and deliverable formulation package. [0010] Accordingly, there is a need for fracturing fluids that are readily hydratable and have controllable viscosity properties through crosslinking that enable efficient and inexpensive pumping and proppant transport down boreholes. SUMMARY OF INVENTION [0011] The present invention is directed to a composition for crosslinking polymers in aqueous solution comprising a crosslinking agent and a base solution of aqueous choline salt, wherein the crosslinking agent may be in solution or in a suspension. The base solution of the composition may be aqueous choline chloride. The composition may further comprise an alcoholic or polyol co-solvent. The choline chloride based solution may suspend the crosslinking agent. The concentration of the choline chloride in the composition maybe from 5 wt% to 95 wt% of the composition, or 30 wt% to 70 wt% of the composition. The concentration of the co-solvent in the composition maybe from 1 wt% to 50 wt% of the composition, 1 wt% to 30 wt% of the composition, or from 5 wt% to 15 wt% of the composition. The co-solvent of the composition is methanol, ethanol, 1- or 2-propanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, alkyloxyethanol ethers, diethylene glycol, alkyldiethyleglycol ethers, or mixtures thereof. The composition may further comprise a biocide or a pH adjuster, or an antioxidant, or combinations thereof. [0012] The crosslinking agent of the composition may be transition metal containing compounds selected from the group consisting of titanium (4+), zirconium (4+) chromium (3+) iron (3+) and aluminum (3+), releasing transition metal ions when dissolved in an aqueous liquid. The crosslinking agent may be a borate releasing compound. The crosslinking agent may be a mixture of a sparingly soluble alkali/alkaline earth metal borate and a slightly soluble borate. The crosslinking agent may be a sparingly soluble borate mineral selected from the group consisting of ulexite, colemanite, probertite, and a mixtures thereof; or a slightly soluble borate and/or borate oxides selected from the group consisting of boric acid, common borax, sodium tetraborate, other alkali or alkaline earth borate hydrates or mixtures thereof; or mixtures of (a) and (b). The concentration of the crosslinking agent in the composition is from 5 wt% to 60 wt% of the composition, or 15 wt% to 45 wt% of the composition. [0013] The present invention is also directed to a fracturing fluid or well service fluid composition comprising a hydrated polysaccharide crosslinked with the composition as described above. The present invention is also directed to a method for recovering hydrocarbons, the method comprising (a) providing the fracturing fluid composition, (b) injecting/pumping the fracturing fluid composition from a ground surface into a geologic formation/fracture; (c) allowing the fracturing fluid to flow to the point of contact with the hydrocarbon; and (d) recovering the hydrocarbon from the geologic formation/fracture at the ground surface. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0014] The invention is directed to concentrate for crosslinking polymers in aqueous solutions for purposes of using in hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a process to enhance the production of oil and gas from wells drilled through hydrocarbon bearing subterranean formations. It can also be used to improve the water injection characteristics of water injection wells used to support hydrocarbon production in water flood projects. Most often, the process occurs by injecting a viscous fluid through the well tubulars at suitable rates and pressure, allowing the formation in contact with the tubulars to respond by fracturing. [0015] The composition comprises a crosslinking agent, a choline chloride solution, and alternatively a co-solvent. The crosslinking agent may be a borate releasing compound. The choline chloride solution is used as the medium to suspend the crosslinking agent particles. Choline chloride is also a clay control agent in fracturing fluids, therefore choline chloride plays dual functions as the clay control agent and the medium for the concentrate. The co-solvent is water, alcohols, polyols or a mixture thereof. [0016] Borate crosslinked gel fracturing fluids utilize borate ions to crosslink the hydrated polymers and provide increased viscosity. The crosslinking obtained by using borate is reversible and is triggered by altering the pH of the fluid system. The reversible characteristic of the crosslinking in borate fluids helps them clean up more effectively, resulting in good regained permeability and conductivity. 1. Definitions.

Crosslinker Composition [0026] The present invention is directed to a crosslinker composition for polymers in an aqueous solution for purposes of fracturing. The crosslinker composition comprises a crosslinking agent, a choline chloride solution, and a co-solvent. The crosslinker composition may be a suspension of the crosslinking agent in a choline chloride and co-solvent solution. Clay stabilizers are routinely added to aqueous stimulation and completion fluids. Choline chloride is one of the very wellknown clay stabilizers used in hydraulic fracturing industry. It has been reported that the mechanism by which ionic stabilizers works is by the ionic interaction of the stabilizer to the fines from the soil. A similar stabilization mechanism is present between choline chloride and the finely ground ulexite to provide a stable suspension. [0027] The polymers may be hydrated, water-soluble polymers suitable for generation of a crosslinked fracturing fluid when combined with the crosslinker composition. The water-souble polymers may be any hydratable polysaccharide that is capable of gelling in the presence of the crosslinker composition to form a gelled base fracturing fluid.

The combination of choline chloride and the co-solvent provide a stable, aqueous solution for the crosslinking agent. The stable aqueous solution of the co-solvent and choline chloride provides the means to thoroughly disperse the crosslinking agents as described below. The co-solvents can be used to make the choline chloride solution. The co-solvents may be further used to combine the choline chloride with the crosslinking agent. b.

The transition metal may be titanium (4+), zirconium (4+) chromium (3+), iron(3+), or aluminum (3+). c. Delayed and Immediate Crosslinker Composition [0035] The crosslinker composition as discussed above may be used for crosslinking polymers in an aqueous solution for purposes of hydraulic fracturing, and may be an immediate crosslinker composition or a delayed crosslinker composition. An immediate crosslinker composition is a crosslinker composition that contains particular crosslinking agents at a particular ratio to the choline chloride and co-solvent levels. The crosslinking is the elapsed time between the uniform additions of the crosslinker composition to the base polymer fluid up to the time of fluid gelation of the fracturing composition. The crosslinking time resulting from an immediate crosslinker composition may be 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, 4 seconds, 5 seconds, 6 seconds, 7 seconds, 8 seconds, 9 seconds, 10 seconds, 11 seconds, 12 seconds, 13 seconds, 14 seconds, 15 seconds, 16 seconds, 17 seconds, 18 seconds, 19 seconds, or 20 seconds. [0036] A delayed crosslinker composition is a crosslinker composition that contains also a particular crosslinking agent at a particular ratio to the choline chloride and co-solvent levels. The delayed crosslinker composition may have a particular delay time. Delay time is defined as the elapsed time between the uniform additions of the crosslinker composition to the base polymer fluid, up to the time of fluid gelation. The delay times span the extreme ranges of those produced by simple solutions of fully soluble alkali or alkaline earth borates (seconds) and those of suspensions of sparingly soluble borate minerals (minutes). A delay time may be the elapsed time between uniform addition of the delayed crosslinker composition to the base polymer fluid up to the time of fracturing fluid gelation and may include a time span of 20 seconds, 21 seconds, 22 seconds, 23 seconds, 24 seconds, 25 seconds, 26 seconds, 27 seconds, 28 seconds, 29 seconds, 30 seconds, 31 seconds, 32 seconds, 33 seconds, 34 seconds, 35 seconds, 36 seconds, 37 seconds, 38 seconds, 39 seconds, 40 seconds, 41 seconds, 42 seconds, 43 seconds, 44 seconds, 45 seconds, 46 seconds, 47 seconds, 48 seconds, 49 seconds, 50 seconds, 51 seconds, 52 seconds, 53 seconds, 54 seconds, 55 seconds, 56 seconds, 57 seconds, 58 seconds, 59 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, 5 minutes, 6 minutes, 7 minutes, 8 minutes, 9 minutes, 10 minutes, 11 minutes, 12 minutes, 13 minutes, 14 minutes, 15 minutes, 16 minutes, 17 minutes, 18 minutes, 19 minutes, 20 minutes, 21 minutes, 22 minutes, 23 minutes, 24 minutes, 25 minutes, 26 minutes, 27 minutes, 28 minutes, 29 minutes, 30 minutes, 31 minutes, 32 minutes, 33 minutes, 34 minutes, 35 minutes, 36 minutes, 37 minutes, 38 minutes, 39 minutes, 40 minutes, 41 minutes, 42 minutes, 43 minutes, 44 minutes, 45 minutes, 46 minutes, 47 minutes, 48 minutes, 49 minutes, 50 minutes, 51 minutes, 52 minutes, 53 minutes, 54 minutes, 55 minutes, 56 minutes, 57 minutes, 58 minutes, 59 minutes, 60 minutes, 1.5 hours, 2.0 hours, 2.5 hours, or 3.0 hours. [0037] The crosslinking time resulting from the use of the crosslinker composition can be controlled by varying any one or all of the following: 1) the crosslinking agent used, 2) the particle size of the crosslinking agent in suspension, 3) the pH of the fracturing fluid prior to the addition of the crosslinker composition suspension, 4) the concentration (i.e., loading) of the crosslinking agent or suspension in the fracturing liquid, 5) the type of crosslinking agent content in the suspension, and 6) the temperature of the fracturing fluid. (1) Type of Crosslinking Agent used [0038] The crosslinking time resulting from use of the crosslinker composition can be controlled by the type of crosslinking agent used. For example, when used under similar conditions, the type of borate compound (i.e., alkali or alkaline earth borates, boric acid and its esters and salts and sparingly soluble ulexite, colemanite, probertite and/or mixtures of any of these) may be employed effectively to control the exact crosslinking time of the polymers in the overall fracturing fluid according to the prevailing amount of freely available soluble borate species. Accordingly, solutions/suspensions of mixtures of both alkali or alkaline earth borates and sparingly soluble borate minerals will crosslink water-soluble polymer solutions over a range of effective times and may fall anywhere in the range of immediate to delayed crosslinking times. (2) Particle Size of the Crosslinking Agent [0039] Particle size of the crosslinking agent may affect the crosslinking time of the fracturing fluid polymers. For example, with respect to the particle size of the suspended borate sources, as particle size increases, the time required for the crosslinking of a water-soluble polymer solution increases. Conversely, as the particle size decreases, the time required for the crosslinking of a water-soluble decreases. Particle sizes of the borate sources suitable for suspension in the aqueous solvent, range from about 20 mesh to about 400 mesh. Particle sizes may be 20 mesh, 30 mesh, 40 mesh, 50 mesh, 60 mesh, 70 mesh, 80 mesh, 90 mesh, 100 mesh, 110 mesh, 120 mesh, 130 mesh, 140 mesh, 150 mesh, 160 mesh, 170 mesh, 180 mesh, 190 mesh, 200 mesh, 210 mesh, 220 mesh, 230 mesh, 240 mesh, 250 mesh, 260 mesh, 270 mesh, 280 mesh, 290 mesh, 300 mesh, 310 mesh, 320 mesh, 330 mesh, 340 mesh, 350 mesh, 360 mesh, 370 mesh, 380 mesh, 390 mesh, or 400 mesh. Combinations of differing mesh sizes may be used. Accordingly, depending upon the particle size of the crosslinking agent, the crosslinking agent may crosslink water-soluble polymer solutions over a range of effective times and be categorized as immediate or delay crosslinking composition. (3) pH of the Polymers [0040] The pH of the polymer solution prior to its crosslinking may be used to control crosslinking time. The pH of the polymer solution affects the solubility rate of the crosslinker composition based on sparingly soluble mineral forms of the crosslinker. For example, a delayed borate based crosslinker composition may delay the crosslinking of water-soluble polymers when using a sparingly soluble mineral form such as ulexite or colmanite. Accordingly, depending upon the pH of the polymer solutions, the crosslinking agent may crosslink polymer solutions over a range of effective times and be categorized as immediate or delayed crosslinker composition. (4) The Concentration and Type of the Crosslinking Agent in Overall Fracturing Fluid [0041] The concentration of the crosslinking agent in the overall fracturing fluid may be used to control the crosslinking time. For example, both the concentration (i.e., loading) of the stable, aqueous suspension of a sparingly soluble borate mineral in the water-soluble polymer solution and the content of the borate in the crosslinker suspension affect the crosslinking time of a water-soluble polymer solution similarly. As either the concentration of the suspension of a sparingly soluble borate mineral in the water-soluble polymer solution or the content of the borate in the crosslinker suspension increase, the crosslinking time of the water-soluble polymer solution decreases. Conversely, as either the concentration of the suspension of a sparingly soluble borate mineral in the water-soluble polymer solution and the content of the borate in the crosslinker suspension decrease, the crosslinking time of the water-soluble polymer solution increases. Accordingly, depending upon the concentration of crosslinking agent in the water-soluble polymer solution and the content of the crosslinking agent in the crosslinker composition, the crosslinking agent may crosslink polymer solutions over a range of effective times and be categorized as immediate or delayed crosslinker composition. (5) Temperature of the Crosslinking Process [0042] Temperature may be used to alter the crosslinking time of a water-soluble polymer solution. As the temperature of the water-soluble polymer solution increases, its crosslinking time decreases. Conversely, as the temperature of the water-soluble polymer solution decreases, its crosslinking time increases. (6) Other Means to Affect Crosslinking Time of the Polymer [0043] An instant crosslinking agent may be a readily soluble form of crosslinking agent such as borax (Na2B4O7T0H2O) or boric acid (H3B03). In these cases, a considerable proportion of freely available borate species is in full solution in the choline chloride medium either as free ions or as mixed-partial borate esters with choline. It is also a property of these formulations that supersaturated stable suspensions can be achieved with high loading of the borate source and which utilize the density suspension properties of the base choline chloride solution. This is advantageous for the preparation of highly active (e.g., 50%) compositions which are yet fluids with low freezing points. [0044] A delayed crosslinker largely remains in suspended form in the composition and only slowly dissolves when added into the full volume of the gel fracturing fluid. The "delay time" is readily adjusted or tuned by both the choice of sparingly soluble mineral and associated co-solvents and depends upon the low prevailing amount of soluble borate species in the total composition. [0045] One simple and direct method of tuning comes from adjusting the relative proportion of co-solvent of the composition - thus higher co-solvent levels yields higher soluble borate species and shorter crosslink delays, while lower co-solvent yields the reverse. Another direct method arises by the co-addition of a small proportion of readily soluble borate such as borax, boric acid, etc. 3. Methods of Preparing the Crosslinker composition and Overall Fracturing Fluid [0046] The present invention is also directed to a method for making the crosslinker composition by combining the crosslinking agent, choline chloride and co-solvents. Several methods are provided below. [0047] One embodiment of the method of synthesizing the crosslinker composition includes the steps of first making the aqueous solution of choline salt with or without co-solvents and then suspending/dissolving the crosslinking agent in the aqueous solvent phase. Another embodiment of the method of synthesizing the crosslinker composition includes the steps of (1) first mixing the crosslinking agent and powdered choline chloride to form a dry mixture; and (2) suspending/dissolving the dry mixture of the crosslinking agent and choline chloride in an aqueous solvent such as water or a mixture of water and alcoholic co-solvent. [0048] An alternative embodiment of the method includes preparing a stable, aqueous suspension/solution of a crosslinking agent, the base medium is first prepared by mixing the co-solvent with an aqueous choline chloride solution to form a mixed solvent. The crosslinking agent is then suspended/dissolved into the mixed solvent to form the stable, aqueous suspension/solution of the crosslinker composition. The resulting stable, aqueous suspension/solution of the crosslinking agent forms a uniform stable composition that is added to a hydrated water-soluble polymer solution for creating a cross-linked gel when adjusted to a suitable pH for the crosslinking reaction. [0049] Another embodiment of the method includes preparing a stable, aqueous suspension/solution of a crosslinking agent that includes a first step of mixing the crosslinking agent and the choline chloride to form a dry mixture. The second step includes suspending/dissolving the dry mixture of the crosslinking agent and the choline chloride in an aqueous solvent. The dry mixture of the crosslinking agent and the choline chloride is stable, which permits its storing and shipment prior to suspension in the aqueous co-solvent. This method, therefore, reduces shipping costs by permitting the shipment of the dry mixture of the crosslinking agent and the choline chloride, which is then mixed on-site with the aqueous solvent. The resulting stable, aqueous suspension/solution of the crosslinking agent forms a uniform stable composition that is added to a hydrated water-soluble polymer solution for creating a fracturing fluid. [0050] Using any one of the above-described methods, the crosslinker composition is prepared by mixing the crosslinking agent in a range of from about 1% to 60% by weight and the aqueous solvent in a range of from about 40% to 99% by weight of the total crosslinking composition. [0051] The crosslinker composition may be prepared by mixing the crosslinking agent in about 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%, 34%, 35%, 36%, 37%, 38%, 39%, 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%, 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, or 60% by weight and the base solvent medium in about 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%, 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% by weight. [0052] In an alternative embodiment of the method for synthesizing the crosslinker composition including preparing a stable, aqueous suspension/solution of a crosslinking agent with a non-neutralized solution of choline. Choline is produced from the addition reaction of trimethylamine to ethylene oxide. The resulting choline zwitterionic reaction product is then typically neutralized with HC1 or with other suitable acids (H2S04 being one other acid commercially employed) to yield the stable salt product of choice. In this method, a solution of choline is neutralized directly with a crosslinking agent such as boric acid (or other boron oxide anhydrous acid forms) to directly yield a choline borate complex solution. The resulting stable, aqueous suspension/solution of the borate crosslinker forms a uniform stable composition that is added to a hydrated water-soluble polymer solution for creating a cross-linked gel when adjusted to a suitable pH for the crosslinking reaction. [0053] The stable, aqueous suspensions of the crosslinking agent with a solution of choline and optionally a co-solvent typically have less than one percent of the suspension separate after storage for 24 hours at room temperature. This settling can be measured by storing the suspension in a long, capped vial and determining the top clearance. This top clearance is generally determined by measuring the portion of the top of the liquid to the line separating the liquid from the suspension and dividing this portion by the total amount of the liquid. Top clearance data for a typical stable, aqueous suspension of the invention is shown in Example 5. [0054] The stable, aqueous suspensions of the crosslinking agent with a solution of choline and optionally a co-solvent generally are easily resuspended after several weeks of storage. Preferably, the stable, aqueous suspension of the invention would be resuspended with about 30 to about 60 minutes of continuous recirculation after storage; more preferably, the suspension would be resuspended with about 30 minutes of continuous recirculation after storage. For example, after more than 8 weeks of storage, a 265 gallon tote containing a stable, aqueous suspension of the invention would be resuspended with about 30 to about 60 minutes of continuous recirculation through a pump conventionally fitted to the tote. 4.

Method of Improving Water Injection Wells Using Well Service Fluid Compositions [0079] The present invention is also directed to a method of improving the water injection characteristics of water injection wells used to support hydrocarbon production in water flood projects using the well service fluid composition. The present invention has multiple aspects, illustrated by the following non-limiting examples. EXAMPLE 1 [0080] Described below is a method of preparing a mixture comprising an aqueous choline chloride (70 wt. % in water) and borate mineral (Ulexite) in the presence of a polyol (glycerol) co-solvent. A stable, aqueous suspension of a delayed borate crosslinker may be prepared by pre-mixing aqueous choline chloride (70%) and co-solvent glycerol, together in an amount of 60% of the total weight. Utilizing an overhead stirrer operated at approximately 600 rpm, powdered Ulexite of 40% total weight and having a particle size of smaller than about 200 mesh is added to the mixture and agitated for approximately 20 minutes at approximately 600 rpm. The resulting stable, aqueous suspension of a delayed borate crosslinker was homogenized for 1 minute at 13,500 rpm to eliminate the larger particle size tail end of the distribution, which aids uniformity. The base fluid utilized for delay time was: 25# βguar hydrated for 10 minutes in a solution containing 0.5 GPT surfactant FFS100E + GPT biocide and pFl adjusted by 11.1. Two GPT crosslinker suspensions were then added to the solution. [0081] Representative mixtures of the present invention are provided in Table 1, wherein mixtures of various wt. ratios of a borate mineral, choline choride, and a co-solvent are described. Table 1 also demonstrates the time required for crosslinking to occur (vortex closure time) in the Example mixtures described herein. [0082] Table 1 shows that mixtures comprising glycerol (Α-2 and Α-3) can effectively be used to control the time it takes for crosslinking to occur. Specifically, Table 1 shows that crosslinking times decrease as the polyol wt. % increases. For instance, compared to (A-l), which contains no glycerol and has a crosslinking time of 300 sec., (Α-2) comprises 10 wt. % glycerol and has a shorter crosslinking time of 145 sec, while (Α-3) comprises 20 wt. % glycerol and has an even shorter crosslinking time of 55 sec.

EXAMPLE 2 [0083] Below is described a method of preparing a mixture comprising an aqueous choline chloride (70 wt. % in water) and borate mineral (Ulexite) in the presence of a polyol (ethylene glycol) co-solvent. A stable, aqueous suspension of a delayed borate crosslinker may be prepared by pre-mixing aqueous choline chloride (70%) and co-solvent ethylene glycol, together in an amount of 60% of the total weight. Then utilizing an overhead stirrer operated at approximately 600 rpm, powdered Ulexite of 40% total weight and having a particle size of smaller than about 200 mesh is added to the mixture and agitated for approximately 20 minutes. The resulting stable, aqueous suspension of a delayed borate crosslinker was homogenized for 1 minute at 13,500 rpm to eliminate the larger particle size tail end of the distribution, which aids uniformity. Representative mixtures of the present invention are provided in Table 2, wherein mixtures of various wt. ratios of a borate mineral, choline choride, and a co-solvent are described. Table 2 also demonstrates the time required for crosslinking to occur (vortex closure time) in the Example mixtures described herein. The compositions and crosslinking times were listed in Table 2. [0084] Table 2 shows that mixtures comprising ethylene glycol (Β-2 and Β-3) can effectively be used to control (shorten or lengthen) the time it takes for crosslinking to occur compared to a mixture where a co-solvent is absent (Β-1). Specifically, Table 2 shows that crosslinking times decrease, with respect to (B-l), for a mixture comprising 20 wt. % ethylene glycol co-solvent (Β-3). However, crosslinking times increase, with respect to (B-l), for a mixture comprising 10 wt. % ethylene glycol co-solvent (Β-2).

EXAMPLE 3 [0085] Described below is a method of preparing a mixture comprising an aqueous choline chloride (70 wt. % in water) and borate mineral (Ulexite) in the presence of water. A stable, aqueous suspension of a delayed borate crosslinker may be prepared by pre-mixing aqueous choline chloride (70%) with additional water as co-solvent, together in an amount of 60% of the total weight. Then utilizing an overhead stirrer operated at approximately 600 rpm, powdered Ulexite of 40% total weight and having a particle size of smaller than about 200 mesh is added to the mixture and agitated for approximately 20 minutes. The resulting stable, aqueous suspension of a delayed borate crosslinker was homogenized for 1 minute at 13,500 rpm to eliminate the larger particle size tail end of the distribution, which aids uniformity. [0086] Representative mixtures of the present invention are provided in Table 3, wherein mixtures of various wt. ratios of a borate mineral, choline choride, and a co-solvent are described. Table 3 also demonstrates the time required for crosslinking to occur (vortex closure time) in the Example mixtures described herein. Table 3 shows that mixtures comprising water that is additional to premixed aqueous choline chloride solution described herein (C-2 and C-3) can effectively be used to control (shorten or lengthen) the time it takes for crosslinking to occur compared to a mixture where a co-solvent is absent (C-l). Specifically, Table 3 shows that crosslinking times decrease, with respect to (C-l), for a mixture comprising 20 wt. % more water (C-3). However, crosslinking times increase, with respect to (C-l), for a mixture comprising 10 wt. % more water (C-2).

EXAMPLE 4 [0087] This example describes a method of preparing a mixture comprising an aqueous choline chloride (70 wt. % in water) and borates (Ulexite and Borax). A stable, aqueous suspension of a delayed borate crosslinker may be prepared by pre-mixing aqueous choline chloride (70%) in an amount of 60% total weight with borax (sodium meta borate) in the amount ranging from 0-17.5% total weight utilizing an overhead stirrer operated at approximately 600 rpm for approximately 20 minutes. After the solution is effected, powdered Ulexite, ranging from 17.5 to 40% of the total weight and having a particle size of smaller than about 200 mesh is added to the mixture and agitation is continued for approximately 20 minutes. The resulting stable, aqueous suspension of a delayed borate crosslinker was homogenized for 1 minute at 13,500 rpm to eliminate the larger particle size tail end of the distribution, which aids uniformity. Representative mixtures of the present invention are provided in Table 4, wherein mixtures of various wt. ratios of a borate mineral, choline choride, and a co-solvent are described. Table 4 also demonstrates the time required for crosslinking to occur (vortex closure time) in the Example mixtures described herein. [0088] Table 4 shows that mixtures comprising both Ulexite and Borax (D-2 and D-3) can effectively be used to control the time it takes for crosslinking to occur. Specifically, Table 4 shows that crosslinking times decrease as the wt. % of Borax increases. For instance, compared to (D-l), which contains no Borax and has a crosslinking time of 300 sec., (D-2) comprises 2 wt. % Borax and has a shorter crosslinking time of 130 sec, while (D-3) comprises 17.5 wt. % Borax and has an even shorter crosslinking time of 16 sec.

The slurry manufactured is placed in long vials with caps to prevent evaporation and placed on lab bench over fixed periods of time and the separation of slurry is recorded as top clearance. The top clearance is measured as the portion of the liquid from the liquid top to the line of separation between the liquid and the suspension and then compared to the total amount of the liquid plus suspension. A typical stable, aqueous suspension as prepared in Examples 1-4 showed the following data.
