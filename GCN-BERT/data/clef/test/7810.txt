Step 6. ((2S)-1-(4-(1-((R)-1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-6-yl)cyclohex-3-en-1-yl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)methanol
Methyl (4-(1-((R)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-6-yl)cyclohex-3-en-1-yl)-L-prolinate (Example 68, step 5, 300 mg, 0.583 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (5 mL), and the mixture was cooled to −78° C. Diisobutylaluminum hydride (0.486 mL, 0.583 mmol, 1.2 M in dichloromethane) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture. The mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 2 h. The mixture was warmed to 0° C., and the reaction was quenched with an aqueous saturated solution of potassium sodium tartrate (30 mL). The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (3×30 mL), and the combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by reversed phase preparative HPLC (Gemini-NX, 10 μm, 250×30 mm, C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif.), eluent: 0 to 100% acetonitrile in water, both eluents containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, gradient elution over 30 min) to afford the title compound as a mixture of diastereomers (73 mg, 26% yield) and light yellow oil.
