Example 67: Synthesis of compound 11329, N-(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)-1-isopropylazetidine-3-arboxamide
N-(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)azetidine-3-carboxamide hydrochloride (0.050 g, 0.109 mmol), synthesized in step 5 of Example 63, and acetone (0.012 mL, 0.164 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) at room temperature, and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (0.035 g, 0.164 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 4 g cartridge; methanol/dichloromethane = from 0% to 20%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.010 g, 19.8%) as a white solid.
