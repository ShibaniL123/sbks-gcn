Step 2 Synthesis of Compound Y
To a solution of Compound 2 (1.84 g, 5.19 mmol) in DMA (20 mL) were added pyridine (1.68 mL, 20.8 mmol) and phenyl chloroformate (0.684 mL, 5.45 mmol), and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. Water was added to the mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate twice. Then, the organic layer was washed with water and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by silicagel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to give Compound Y (1.47 g, Yield 60%).
