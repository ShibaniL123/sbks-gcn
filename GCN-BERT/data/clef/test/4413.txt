EXAMPLE 80
2-(3-isopropyl-2,4-dioxo-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-pyrimidin-5-yl)-benzoic acid (reaction scheme No. 3, compound 80)
371 mg (1.2 mmol) of barium hydroxide octahydrate is added to a solution of 45 mg (78 Î¼mol) of 2-(3-isopropyl-2,4-dioxo-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-pyrimidin-5-yl)-methyl benzoic acetate in 2 ml of methanol. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 25 hours. Water is added to the mixture. The aqueous phase is adjusted to pH 5 with 1N aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, then after extraction with ethyl acetate, the organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and then filtered and concentrated to dryness. The crude residue is purified by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (Xbridge C18 column, isocratic, 37% acetonitrile in water). 12 mg (27%) of 2-(3-isopropyl-2,4-dioxo-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-pyrimidin-5-yl)-benzoic acid is obtained in the form of a white solid.
