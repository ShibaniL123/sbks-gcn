Synthesis Example 2
Toluene-4-sulfonic acid 2-(4-diphenylphosphanyl-phenoxy)-ethyl ester
A reaction vessel was charged with 4-diphenylphosphanyl phenol (434 mg, 1.56 mmol), 1,2-bis(tosyloxy)ethane (2.89 g, 7.80 mmol), potassium carbonate (431 mg, 3.12 mmol), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 5 mL). The reaction vessel was heated to 50° C., and reaction was effected for 19 hours. After the reaction, water and ethyl acetate were added to the reaction system, unreacted 1,2-bis(tosyloxy)ethane was removed by filtration, and then the product was extracted three times with ethyl acetate into the organic layer. The resulting organic layer was washed with saturated saline and dried with MgSO4. After concentration under reduced pressure, the concentrate was separated by Hi-flash silica column chromatography (developing solvent, ethyl acetate:hexane=22:78→43:57) to yield a product (587 mg (1.23 mmol), 79% yield, white solid).
