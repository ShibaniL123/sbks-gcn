Example 55. Synthesis of N-(1-(3-Acetamidobenzyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-4-((4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)methyl)benzamide (D11)
Step 1. Synthesis of N-(3,5-Dimethyl-1-(3-nitrobenzyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-4-((4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)methyl)benzamide (IA17)
Compound IA17 was prepared from intermediate IA9b and 4-((4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)methyl)benzoic acid via an EDC-mediated amide formation in a fashion similar to the one described for compound A1. Yellow solid, 110 mg, 42% yield.
