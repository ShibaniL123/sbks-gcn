To a 30-mL round bottom flask, ((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-1,2,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-3H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-3-yl)(3-methoxy-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)methanone (15 mg, 31 µmol) obtained above was added, and dissolved in methylene chloride (1 mL). A 1.0 M solution of boron tribromide in methylene chloride (153 µL, 0.15 mmol) was added to the solution under ice cooling, and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. A 1.4 N solution of ammonia in methanol was added to terminate the reaction, and then the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was suspended in saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, and then the suspension was extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the insoluble substance was separated by filtration, and then the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was subjected to preparative TLC using methanol containing aqueous ammonia and chloroform (concentration, 10%) as the developing solvent to obtain the title compound (10.6 mg, 73%) as pale yellow amorphous substance.
