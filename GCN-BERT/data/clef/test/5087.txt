CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/949,655, filed on Mar. 7, 2014. TECHNICAL FIELD Exemplary embodiments described herein relate to weighted exercise devices that may be used in, for example and without limitation, fitness or rehabilitation activities. BACKGROUND The benefits of exercise, particularly with respect to strength training, have been known for 5,000 years or more. (See, e.g., History of Weightlifting at www.teamusa.org). In this regard, ancient cultures developed various resistance training (e.g., weight lifting) routines for building strength, as well tests and competitions to demonstrate the prowess of the weight lifters of the day. History similarly traces a variety of corresponding weight lifting devices that were developed over time. These devices include objects as rudimentary as stones, to more sophisticated devices such as Indian clubs, dumbbells, barbells and kettlebells. Along the way, a weighted and round exercise ball now commonly referred to as a “medicine ball,” was also developed. Initially, medicine balls may have been no more than animal skins or other types of bladders filled with sand. Nonetheless, it has been documented that at least some ancient cultures used such devices for strength training and in rehabilitation therapy. Interest in medicine ball training continues to the present, and advances in materials and manufacturing techniques have accordingly altered the construction of such devices. Particularly, modern medicine balls are typically constructed from a vinyl or other leather-like cover that is filled with sand or a similar material and subsequently sealed. Consequently, typical medicine balls may experience some level of shape deformations during use. Medicine balls may be used at least in a variety of strength, flexibility, agility and injury recovery exercises. For example, and without limitation, a medicine ball may be held or carried while performing various resistance exercises. A medicine ball may also be repeatedly thrown against a wall and caught, or may be thrown or passed from one exercise partner to another. While the use of a medicine ball may be advantageous, such as by allowing for passing or throwing exercises to be more safely performed, medicine balls of known design are not without drawbacks—particularly when used for certain exercises. More particularly, while medicine balls are normally offered in weights ranging from about 2-25 pounds, a standard medicine ball is typically still round and about 14 inches in diameter. While other sizes (i.e., diameters) have also become available, as well as medicine balls with attached handles, the overall shape of existing medicine balls is still round. As a result of their shape and construction, those of skill in the art and likely even novice users will understand that known medicine balls have inherent deficiencies when used for certain exercises. For example, when placing a known medicine ball between the legs or feet to add resistance for exercises such as pull-ups or various core training exercises such as leg raises, etc., the diameter and/or hardness of the ball may cause user discomfort. Additionally, known medicine balls have a tendency to easily slide out from between the legs or feet because the round shape of the medicine ball is largely incompatible with the shape of the grasping body parts. And even if the medicine ball is not completely dropped during such use, retaining and maintaining control of the medicine ball frequently requires concentration on the part of the user that should instead be directed at other aspects of the associated exercise. It can, therefore, be understood that there is a need for a weighted exercise device having certain characteristics of a known medicine ball, such as a somewhat soft and malleable construction, but with a shape and design that facilitates use of the device during exercises where grasping and/or retention of a known medicine ball would typically be difficult. Embodiments of weighted exercise devices of the invention satisfy this need. SUMMARY Weighted exercise device embodiments according to the invention are of generally malleable construction, which may be imparted by a somewhat pliable cover and a displaceable filling material. However, unlike known medicine balls, weighted exercise device embodiments of the invention have a contoured and more ergonomic shape, rather than a simple round shape. This more ergonomic design virtually eliminates slippage and improves comfort for the user. Particularly, the contoured shape combined with the malleable construction facilitates gripping the device at different locations along a user's body, thus allowing for more effective use of a weighted exercise device during at least certain resistance training exercises. It is contemplated that weighted exercise device embodiments may be constructed, for example, of a moldable plastic cover that is filled with sand or another displaceable material. The cover should be somewhat pliant to allow for some level of device deformity, which enhances comfort and improves gripping ability during use. Weighted exercise device embodiments may be provided in multiple different sizes and weights. Various construction techniques are possible, including but not limited to blow molding and rotational molding of a cover, followed by filling of the cover with a weight supplying fill material. The weight supplying fill material may be, for example, sand, crushed shells (e.g., walnut shells), metallic (e.g., steel or lead) pellets, or other materials or combinations of materials that can provide a desired weight without precluding the overall malleable nature of the device. Other aspects and features of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments along with the accompanying drawing figures. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS In the following descriptions of the drawings and exemplary embodiments, like reference numerals across the several views refer to identical or equivalent features, and: FIG. 1 is a first three dimensional view of one exemplary embodiment of a weighted exercise device residing in a vertical position; FIG. 2 is a second three dimensional view of the weighted exercise device of FIG. 1, with the device residing in a substantially horizontal position; FIG. 3 is a front view of the weighted exercise device of FIGS. 1-2; FIG. 4 is an end view of the weighted exercise device of FIGS. 1-3; FIG. 5 is sectional view of the weighted exercise device of FIGS. 1-4, taken along line A-A shown in FIG. 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT(S) One exemplary embodiment of a weighted exercise device 5 is depicted in FIGS. 1-5. As shown, the device 5 has two spaced apart and somewhat bulbous ends 10, 15 separated but connected by an arcuate intermediate portion 20. Consequently, this particular embodiment of the device 5 has a contoured shape that at least somewhat mimics the shape of, for example, an hourglass or an apple core. As should be apparent, the shape of the device 5 facilitates its retention between, for example, the knees, calves, ankles or feet of a user when performing various exercises including, but not limited to, core training exercises such as leg or plank lifts, or other resistance training exercises such as pull-ups, press-ups, or dips. It is also contemplated that the shape of the device 5 will further permit its use during exercises such as squats and lunges, such as by placing the intermediate portion of the device over the shoulder of the user. Obviously, a separate device 5 could also be placed over each shoulder of the user so that the body is evenly loaded. It is further contemplated that the shape of the device 5 will also facilitate its use during exercises such as sit ups or back extensions by placing or holding the intermediate portion of the device against the front or back, respectively, of the user's neck. In comparison to round medicine balls, especially standard size medicine balls, the shape of the device 5 also facilitates its use during exercises that require gripping with the hands. For example, the device 5 may be oriented vertically (see FIG. 1) and gripped about the intermediate portion during the performance of, for example, front arm raises, seated or standing triceps presses, or lying chest pullovers. Notably, with respect to any of the exemplary uses of the device 5 described above, the shape and construction of the device lends itself to improved comfort in comparison to, for example, a hard rubber or steel dumbbell. Additionally, the construction of the device 5 obviously improves the safety of any such exercise where the device is required to be held over or passed over the user's head, face, etc. Weighted exercise device embodiments according to the invention may be of various size and may be of numerous different weights. For example, such weighted exercise device embodiments may be provided in the 2-25 pound weight range of typical medicine balls. It is also contemplated that heavier weights may be provided, depending on the nature of the fill material and the capacity of the cover to retain the fill material and retain its shape. Device dimensions may also vary. Without limitation, however, an exemplary weighted exercise device embodiment hereof having a weight of between about 5-25 pounds and being filled with a material such as for example, and without limitation, sand, crushed walnut shells, metallic pellets, or some combination of such materials to achieve a density necessary to provide the desired weight within the given volume of the device, might have an overall length of about 6-10 inches and an intermediate portion cross-sectional dimension of approximately 2-3 inches. As stated above, other suitable fill materials or combinations of fill materials may also be used. Similarly, a weighted exercise device embodiment hereof is not limited to the exemplary dimensional ranges provided above. For example, it may be desirable to change the curvature dimensions of the intermediate portion such that a weighted exercise device embodiment best frames a particular body part(s) where the device will be placed and supported (e.g., between the knees or behind the neck). In this regard, exemplary weighted exercise device embodiments may also be provided in sizes (e.g., small, medium, large) that are targeted to users of different stature—with the various sizes corresponding to different height/weights, etc., and with the curvature dimensions of the intermediate portion varying accordingly. It is also contemplated with respect to the dimensions of the intermediate portion of an exemplary weighted exercise device embodiment that a reduced cross-sectional dimension may facilitate use in single arm exercises that are traditionally performed with dumbbells. Such exercises may include, without limitation, arm curls, shoulder presses, lateral arm raises, triceps extensions, etc. Furthermore, a reduced intermediate portion cross-sectional dimension may be better-suited to smaller or younger users, whether held between the knees, calves, ankles or feet, or between or by the hands. In regard to weight and size, it is also noted that weighted exercise device embodiments of different weights may nonetheless be of the same volume. Alternatively, and as is common with dumbbells, the volume of weighted exercise device embodiments hereof may change as the weight changes. In the former case, achieving different weights within a like volume may be achieved by adjusting the density of the fill material used. In the latter case, portions such as the bulbous ends of a weighted exercise device embodiment may be enlarged to accommodate a greater amount of a common fill material, although different fill materials may again be used to produce a desired weight. Further in regard to weight and size, it is noted that a weighted exercise device embodiment according to the invention may include internal bracing, spines, bulk heads, webbing, etc., that help to maintain the intended shape of the device but do not result in an unacceptably adverse effect on the feel and malleability thereof. For example, in the case of a weighted exercise device such as that shown in FIGS. 1-5, a reinforcing rod or tube could traverse the intermediate portion of heavier embodiments while being simultaneously surrounded by fill material so as to maintain the desired feel and malleability of the device 5. Similar internal supports could be located within the ends of any weighted exercise device embodiments. In a more complex embodiment, a full endoskeleton may be present but sufficiently encased in fill material so as to retain the aforementioned device characteristics. In any case, the contoured shape of weighted exercise device embodiments contemplated herein is more ergonomic in nature and, when coupled with the malleable nature of the device construction, virtually eliminates slippage during use and improves comfort for the user. Consequently, such weighted exercise device embodiments may be more effectively used during resistance training—particularly for certain exercises. It is also possible that exemplary weighted exercise device embodiments may employ a textured outer surface to further reduce or eliminate device slippage during use. While abdominal core training is no doubt a class of resistance training where the benefits of such weighted exercise device embodiments would be seen, similar benefits may also be obtained when using such devices with at least the other exemplary exercises mentioned above. As with the exact size, shape and weight of weighted exercise device embodiments of the invention, device construction may also vary. The covers of said devices may be constructed of, for example, a moldable plastic such as a thermoplastic elastomer having an appropriate hardness. However, other cover materials may also be possible, including without limitation, other plastics, rubber, vinyl, leather, etc., as long as such materials are capable of substantially retaining their shape while being sufficiently pliable. Such weighted exercise device embodiments may be filled with sand, crushed walnut or other shells, metallic pellets such as steel or lead pellets (which may be of various grain size) and/or other materials that are sufficiently dense so as to provide an appropriate weight within acceptable device dimensions, and do not unacceptably hinder the overall malleability of the device. The hardness (durometer) of weighted exercise device embodiments of the invention may also vary but, for example, may be between about 80 to 90 on the Shore A scale in at least some variations. Weighted exercise device embodiments of the invention may be constructed by any manufacturing technique now or not yet known, as long as the aforementioned device characteristics can be imparted thereby. Such cover manufacturing techniques may include, without limitation, a blow molded or rotational molded process, as such techniques may allow for mass production at the lowest cost. As can best be observed in FIG. 5, for example, the particular exemplary weighted exercise device embodiment 5 of FIGS. 1-5 includes a molded cover 25 in the form of a substantially hollow shell that defines the overall shape and volume of the device. The cover 25 thickness may vary according to, for example and without limitation, the target weight of the device 5, the type of fill material being used, the type of cover material being used, etc., or a combination of such factors. As one non-limiting example, testing has shown that a pliable thermoplastic elastomer cover having a thickness of approximately 0.10 inches may exhibit acceptable malleability while simultaneously maintaining its shape without excessive deformation within a given weight range (e.g., 2-25 pounds). Other cover thicknesses are, of course, also possible. Following molding, the cover 25 of the weighted exercise device embodiment 5 is filled with a selected fill material or combination of fill materials to achieve a desired weight, and in a manner that results in a sealed cover. In this exemplary embodiment, filling of the cover occurs through a molded in port 30 that is then sealed with a plug (not shown). Molding over internal reinforcement components, such as some form of insert molding or the like, is also contemplated. Other weighted exercise device embodiment features are also contemplated. For example, it is possible for such weighted exercise devices to be provided in a set that includes individual or pairs of devices of different weights (e.g., five pound increments between 5-25 pounds). Weighted exercise device embodiments hereof may also be color coded, with each color representing a different weight. This may be especially useful in the case where weighted exercise devices of different weights are all provided with the same volume (as described above). It is further possible to provide a weighted exercise device embodiment as a kit, whereby an empty cover and possibly a sealing element are provided to a user, and the user provides the fill material as instructed to achieve a desired weight and then seals the cover. Such an embodiment may be useful in reducing shipping costs—whether provided to a distributor or to an end user. While the exemplary embodiments shown in the drawing figures have been described herein in the context of resistance training of a fitness variety, it is to be understood that such embodiments could be used equally effectively in rehabilitation therapy, and in flexibility or agility training. Generally speaking, it is intended that weighted exercise device embodiments of the invention may at least be substituted for known weighted exercise balls or standard dumbbells in a variety of exercises. Therefore, nothing herein is meant to or should be interpreted as limiting the manner in which weighted exercise device embodiments of the invention may be used.
