AN ABLATION CATHETER Technical Field [0001] This disclosure relates, generally, to a method catheter and, more particularly, to an ablation catheter. Background Art [0002] Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field. [0003] In the conduction of Maze type procedures, an ablation catheter is used to ablate heart tissue to attempt to clear heart arrhythmias. Generally a dot ablation is made and this is repeated by re-positioning a tip, ablation electrode of an ablation catheter. This is an extremely time consuming process. In addition, dot ablation may leave gaps in the lesions which may again require re-positioning and repeating the procedure. If a clinician could form longer lesions, fewer manipulations would be required. This would reduce the time to conduct the procedure which would be beneficial for all concerned. Longer electrodes and multiple electrodes have been considered for radiofrequency ablation but coagulum tends to form on the electrodes. In addition, the energy field from long electrodes is not always uniform and this may cause discontinuities in the lesion. Furthermore, the temperature of the ablation electrodes as well as the tissue being treated needs to be carefully maintained to ensure that it does not result in excessive ablation of the tissue. Summary [0004] It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative. [0005] In an aspect, there is provided an ablation catheter which includes a control handle having an electrical connector arranged at a proximal end of the control handle, the electrical connector being connectable to an RF energy source. The catheter further includes a catheter sheath having a proximal end and a distal end, the catheter sheath defining a fluid lumen and having one or more perforations proximal the distal end of the catheter sheath, the catheter sheath being connected to the control handle. The ablation catheter further includes an elongate shape imparting element of conductive material inserted into the fluid lumen of the catheter sheath and connected to the control handle at an attachment point, and an electrical conductor extending from the electrical connector to the attachment point for electrically connecting the shape imparting element to the electrical connector. [0006] In an embodiment the catheter sheath is connected to the control handle via a catheter sheath connector. [0007] In an embodiment the ablation catheter includes a coupling mechanism for removably connecting the shape imparting element to the control handle. [0008] In an embodiment the ablation catheter includes a fastener for connecting the electrical conductor to the coupling mechanism. [0009] In an embodiment the ablation catheter includes a fluid tube in a sealing connection with the fluid lumen of the catheter sheath, the fluid tube extending from a catheter sheath connector through the control handle and the proximal end of the control handle to a fluid connector for supplying fluid to the fluid lumen of the catheter sheath. [0010] In an embodiment the ablation catheter includes a catheter sheath connector for connecting the catheter sheath to the control handle, the catheter sheath extending through the catheter sheath connector and the control handle to the proximal end of the control handle, and being connected to a fluid connector. [0011] In an embodiment, the catheter sheath is removably connectable to the control handle via a catheter sheath connector. [0012] In an embodiment, the shape imparting element is removably attached to the control handle. [0013] In an embodiment, the catheter sheath includes conductors embedded within the wall of the sheath. [0014] In an embodiment, the catheter sheath includes at least one sensing electrode. [0015] In an embodiment, the catheter sheath connector includes an electrical sheath connector for connecting conductors from the sensing electrodes to a monitoring device. [0016] In an embodiment, the ablation catheter includes electrical connector elements extending through the control handle to electrically connect the electrical sheath connector to the electrical connector so as to allow the catheter to be connected to the monitoring device. [0017] In an embodiment, the sensing electrodes are positioned adjacent the one or more perforations. [0018] In an embodiment, the catheter sheath is formed of a helically wound cable including: an inner non-conductive tubular member; and an outer layer having a plurality of conductors coiled in a helical manner embedded within the wall of the outer layer. [0019] In an embodiment, a distal portion of the outer layer including the conductors embedded within the wall of that portion of the outer layer is removed to expose a distal portion of the inner non-conductive tubular member, and wherein the perforations are formed on the exposed portion of the inner non-conductive tubular member. Brief Description of Drawings [0020] Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: [0021] Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of individual elements of a proximal part of an ablation catheter; [0022] Fig. 2 shows a schematic view of a proximal part of an ablation catheter; [0023] Fig. 3 shows a schematic side view of a distal end of an ablation catheter; [0024] Fig. 4a and 4b show a distal end of an ablation catheter having a double loop at the distal end; and [0025] Fig. 5 shows a cable used for making a catheter sheath. Description of Embodiments [0026] Figure 1 of the drawings shows the individual parts of the proximal end 100 of a modular ablation catheter. The individual components are also considered as embodiments of the invention. The catheter sheath 102 defines a fluid lumen that extends from the proximal end 103 of the catheter sheath to the distal end of the sheath (not shown in Figure 1). The catheter sheath 102 is a tubular member made of a suitable polymeric material such as polyethylene or polyether block amide (ΡΕΒΑΧ ®). Other suitable, bio-compatible polymeric materials could also be used. The catheter sheath may also include conductors embedded within the wall of the sheath as explained in reference to Figure 5 below. [0027] The ablation catheter of Figure 1 includes a handle assembly 104 including a body 105. The body 105 extends between a distal end 106 and a proximal end 107. The body includes a compartment 108 that is configured to receive a shape imparting element 110 such as a stylet that can be used to deflect the distal end of the catheter. [0028] Referring to Figure 1, the catheter sheath 102 connects removably to the body 105 of the handle at its proximal portion 103. The handle assembly 104 also includes a cover 109 removably attachable to the body 105. This attachment may be a slidable connection or a screw or a screw assembly that allows the attachment of the cover 109 to the body 105. [0029] The shape imparting element 110 is removably mountable to body 105. Specifically, the shape imparting element 110 is mounted within compartment 108 defined by the body 105. The body 105 includes an aperture at an attachment point (not shown in Figure 1) configured to receive a fastener 111 for the removable attachment of the shape imparting element 110 to the handle. [0030] In one embodiment, the shape imparting element 110 includes an outer tubular member 112, an inner actuator (not shown in Figure 1), and a coupling mechanism 121 for removably and releasably coupling the shape imparting element to the catheter handle. The outer tubular member 112 defines a lumen configured to receive the inner actuator (not shown in Figure 1). The distal end of the inner actuator such as a pull wire or the like is attached to the distal end of the outer tubular member so that the relative movement of the inner actuator and the outer tubular member results in deflection of the distal end of the shape imparting element. [0031] The coupling mechanism 121 includes a friction block 113 and a slide 114. The outer tubular member 112 is attached to a friction block 113, and the inner actuator is attached to a slide 114. Friction block 113 is configured to receive the fastener 111 such that the outer tubular member of the shape imparting element 110 is, in use, fixedly mounted to body 105. That is, fastener 111 connects the friction block 113 to the body 105 by attaching to an appropriate aperture (not shown in Figure 1) in the body 105. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other embodiments of the invention include alternative methods for fixedly mounting the tubular member 112 to body 105, in use. The inner actuator of the shape imparting element is, in use, movably mounted to body 105 via slide 114. Slide 114 is connected to cover 109 so that pushing the body 105 displaces the handle body 105 and the outer tubular member 112 in relation to cover 109 and thus inner actuator of the shape imparting element. In use, displacement of the inner actuator or the slide 114 with respect to outer tubular member 112 controls shape imparting element 110. More specifically, movement of the inner actuator or the slide 114 with respect to the outer tubular member 112, in use, steers or imparts a shape in the distal end of the catheter sheath 102. [0032] In another embodiment, the shape imparting element 110 includes a shapeimparting stylet received within the lumen of the catheter sheath 102. The stylet is configured to impart a shape in the distal end of the catheter sheath 102. It is also possible for the outer tubular member 112 of the shape imparting element 110 to have a predetermined non-linear shape such as a loop or a double loop that imparts a shape to the distal end of the catheter sheath 102. Various arrangements of steering mechanisms and shape imparting elements are discussed in other patent applications naming the present applicant, which are herein incorporated by cross reference. [0033] It will be appreciated that the terms “releasably connectable”, “removably attached” and the like, as used herein, refers to arrangements whereby two components are configured in such a manner as to enable their connection/attachment, and enable that connection/attachment to be reversed without necessarily damaging either component. That is, the connection/attachment is repeatable. This is significant in the context of a modular device, as the various individual components may be interchanged between devices (for example where some components are discarded after use, and others reprocessed (e.g. cleaned or otherwise serviced) for further use. It is also to be noted that each one of the shape imparting element and the catheter sheath may be fixedly attached to the handle. It is a preferred embodiment that the connection between the handle and the shape imparting element or the catheter sheath is releasable. [0034] In use, pressurized fluid is supplied to the fluid lumen of the catheter sheath 102 via the fluid connector element 116 and the fluid tube 115. The fluid tube 115 extends inside the handle from the distal part of the handle body 106 through to the proximal part 107 of the handle body 105 and connects to a fluid connector 116. The fluid connector 116 is a Luer connector or similar that ensures a sealing connection from the connector element 116 to the fluid tube 115. In an embodiment, the proximal end of the catheter sheath extends through the catheter sheath connector 118 so that the fluid tube 115 consists of the proximal part of the catheter sheath 102. [0035] The catheter sheath connector 118 is arranged on the catheter sheath 102 and includes an electrical connector 119 for connecting conductors from sensing electrodes to a monitoring device, when sensing electrodes are used. This is discussed in more detail below with reference to Figures 4a and 4b. The catheter sheath connector 118 may include any suitable form of electrical connector such as, for example, an electrical plugtype arrangement, a slip-ring type arrangement or the like. When the catheter sheath does not include any sensing electrodes connector element 119 is not needed. The catheter sheath connector 118 further includes a snap on connector 120 and a complimentary receiving element at the distal end of the handle (not shown in Figures 1 or 2). The snap on connector and its complimentary snap on receiving element on the handle enable the detachable connection of the catheter sheath to the handle. [0036] The catheter sheath connector 118 as well as its complimentary part on the handle body is formed so as to allow the passage of the shape imparting element 110 through it as well as the fluid tube. Each connector part includes a bore through which the shape imparting mechanism and the fluid tube are able to pass. This can be seen in more detail in Figure 2. In Figure 2, the catheter sheath connector 118 includes an electrical connector 119 that is modified so that the shape imparting element 110 can pass through the connectors 119 and 118. [0037] When sensing electrodes are being used, electrical connectors (not shown in Figures 1 or 2) extend from the complimentary connector element at the distal end of the handle 106 through the handle body 105 to the electrical connector element 117 at the proximal end 107 of the handle so as to allow the catheter to be connected to a patient monitor or the like. The electrical connector 117 at the proximal end of the handle also allows a source of ablation energy to be connected to the shape imparting element 110. The connector 117 preferably incorporates a slip ring arrangement or similar form of rotation permitting arrangement, to allow rotation of the handle without rotating the patient cable. [0038] Ablation of tissue is achieved by energizing fluid supplied to the catheter sheath fluid lumen by RF (radiofrequency) energy. The fluid in the fluid lumen of the catheter sheath 102 is energized by supplying the shape imparting element 110 with RF energy from a RF energy source via the electrical connector 117. A conductor (not shown in Figures 1 or 2) is connected from the electrical connector 117 to the outer tubular member 112 of the shape imparting element 110. The conductor wire extends from the electrical connector 117 through the handle body 105 to the attachment point of the shape imparting element. In the embodiment of Figure 1, the attachment point is the point where the fastener 111 attaches the shape imparting element to the handle. At the attachment point, the conductor wire is attached to the electrically conductive coupling mechanism 121 which then conducts the RF energy to the outer tubular member 112 thereby to charge the shape imparting element 110 with the RF energy. The connection between the conductor and coupling mechanism 121 can be implemented so that the conductor is pressed against the friction element 113 by fastener 111. The charged shape imparting element 110 energizes the fluid adjacent the shape imparting element in the fluid lumen and the energized and pressurized fluid is then expelled to the tissue through one or more perforations at the distal end of the catheter sheath 102. The shape imparting element 110 thus also acts as an electrode and no separate electrode is needed for charging the fluid with RF energy. [0039] Ablation catheters accordingly to embodiments of the invention are thus simpler in structure as there is no need for a separate electrode for charging the fluid with RF energy. This simplified structure is advantageous from a manufacturing and cost perspective. [0040] Figure 3 depicts the distal end 130 of the catheter sheath 102. Ablation of tissue is achieved by RF (radiofrequency) energy transfer through conductive saline fluid escaping the distal end 130 of the catheter sheath through multiple perforations 131. These perforations 131 may populate the entire wall of the catheter sheath 102 or they may be arranged at a pre-determined formation on the sheath so as to direct the fluid path to a desired location. The fluid is supplied to the fluid lumen of the catheter sheath by an irrigation pump via the connector element 116 and the fluid tube 115. The fluid is energized by the adjacent shape imparting element 110 which is charged with the RF energy. The energized and pressurized fluid is expelled towards the tissue through the multiple perforations 131 in the distal end 130 of the catheter sheath 102. [0041] The distal end of the ablation catheter may be of straight configuration as seen in Figure 3. It is also possible that the distal end of the shape imparting element is made of a shape-memory wire. As the shape imparting element is inserted into the fluid lumen of the catheter sheath it will impart a desired shape to the distal end of the catheter sheath. The distal end of the catheter sheath may also be heat set to a loop shape. The size of the loop may also be variable. Figures 4a and 4b show a double loop catheter having a first, smaller loop with sensing electrodes on the catheter sheath and a second, larger loop with perforations arranged around the catheter sheath. In the embodiment depicted in Figure 3, the perforations are located evenly around the distal end of the catheter sheath. However, any pattern of the perforations can be used. In a loop embodiment such as shown in Figures 4a and 4b, for example, covering 1/3 of the surface of the sheath is used, preferably the outer surface of the loop. Using directional RF energy by different directional patterns of the perforations means that lower power levels will be required to create an effective lesion as less energy is lost to the blood pool. [0042] With reference to Figure 5, a catheter sheath is described that can be used for a double loop catheter shown in Figures 4a and 4b. The catheter sheath may be made of a helically wound cable 152. A plurality of conductors 153 are coiled in a helical manner around the outer surface of an inner non-conductive tubular member 154. The cable 152 also includes an outer polymeric layer 155 on top of the conductors so as to form a cable having a layer of helically wound conductors embedded within a wall of the cable. This allows for the sensing electrodes to be formed on the surface of the tubular element in any desired pattern. In addition, it allows for a large number of sensing electrodes to be formed on the tubular element as there will be no conductors running through the lumen of the tubular element of the catheter. A part of the outer polymeric layer 155 and the conductors 153 are removed by laser cutting. Perforations 156 are formed on the remaining inner non-conductive layer 154 so as to create a distal tip of the electrode sheath as shown in Figure 4a and 4b. [0043] Figures 4a and 4b show the distal tip of an ablation catheter 101 where multiple sensing electrodes 141 are formed on the smaller sensing loop 145, and the larger ablating loop 144 has multiple perforations 143 used for ablating the tissue. The catheter sheath 142 is made of the tubular cable having conductors wound helically between two layers of polymeric material. The sensing loop 145 has sensing electrodes 141 that are formed on the cable by exposing a desired conductor wire by laser cutting and then forming a ring electrode in electrical connection with the exposed conductor wire. The larger ablating loop 144 is made to the distal end of the electrode sheath cable by laser cutting and removing the outer layer and all conductor wires from the length of the circumference of the ablating loop 144. Small perforations 143 are then laser cut on the remaining inner polymeric member. The pattern of the perforations 143 can vary. In Figure 4a, the perforations are arranged on 1/3 of the outer surface around the circumference of the ablating loop 144, and in Figure 4b, they are arranged in a straight line around the outer circumference of the ablating loop 144. [0044] Using irrigation as a conduit for RF energy minimises edge effects because it virtually increases the size of the electric field source. Edge effects concentrate the RF energy at the edges of the electrodes and cause energy gradients that make the lesion uneven. As there is a constant exchange of irrigation there is constant cooling at the tissue surface whilst continuously delivering energy through the tissue. Charging the shape imparting element with RF energy simplifies the structure of a catheter as it removes the need for separate ablating electrodes. Irrigation also washes away charred thrombus and other artefacts generated by RF procedures.
