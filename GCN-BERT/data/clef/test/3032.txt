AC721-PCT DESCRIPTION TITLE OF THE INVENTION ABSORBENT ARTICLE Technical Field [0001] The present invention relates to an absorbent article, such as an incontinence pad, disposable diaper or sanitary napkin, or panty liner. Background Art [0002] Absorbent articles, for example, incontinence pads that absorb fluid such as urine that has been excreted by light incontinence, commonly comprise a liquid-permeable top sheet disposed on the user skin side, a liquid-impermeable back sheet disposed on the clothing side and an absorbent body provided between the top sheet and the back sheet. In order to maintain a satisfactory feel of the top sheet on the skin of the user when a user has discharged excreted fluid in such an incontinence pad, a second sheet having elasticity that can function as a cushion, and capable of rapidly and temporarily holding the excreted fluid, is often provided between the top sheet and the absorbent body. One type of second sheet that is known is of the type described in PTLs 1 to 3, for example, wherein a projection is formed protruding to the top sheet surface of the sheet surface, in order to form spaces to temporarily hold excreted fluid between the second sheet and the top sheet and increase absorption performance, and in order to utilize an elastic force of the second sheet to increase the cushioning property to maintain a satisfactory feel of the top sheet on the skin of the user . In the design described in PTL 1, however, despite excellent absorbing power for excreted fluid due to formation of the spaces between the second sheet and the top sheet by projections of the second sheet, the fact that the projections and the top sheet are not joined has often allowed the projections and top sheet to move independently of each other. Thus, the elastic force of the projections has not been adequately utilized, resulting in the potential to produce a poor feel on the skin of the user. Furthermore, because the projections of the second sheet are separated from the top sheet, fluid can pool between the projections and the top sheet, often resulting in rewetting into the top sheet and reduced comfort during use. Moreover, with the sheet described in PTL 2, the second sheet has a construction in which the second sheet as a whole is formed so as to have a wavy cross-section, thereby forming projections, and therefore when movement by the user causes pressing force to act in the thickness direction of the incontinence pad, the projections collapse, resulting in collapse of the spaces formed between the second sheet and the top sheet and making it impossible to hold excreted fluid, or the held excreted fluid can potentially rewet the top sheet. Furthermore, with the sheet described in PTL 3, the entire second sheet is formed to have a wavy crosssection, and the absorbent body also has a wavy crosssection similar to the second sheet, and therefore when the absorbent body has absorbed excreted fluid and expanded, the bottom sections of the recesses formed between adjacent projections of the second sheet move to locations at the tip ends of the projections, eventually causing the recesses to disappear and potentially resulting in loss of the concavoconvexities. When this occurs, the spaces formed between the second sheet and the top sheet disappear, temporarily preventing holding of excreted fluid and potentially reducing absorption performance.

Solution to Problems [0006] In order to solve this problem, the absorbent article of the invention has the following construction. (1) An absorbent article comprising a liquid-permeable top sheet, a liquid-impermeable back sheet provided on one surface of the top sheet, an absorbent body that is long in one direction, provided between the top sheet and the back sheet, and a second sheet provided between the absorbent body and the top sheet, the absorbent article being long in a direction along a lengthwise direction of the absorbent body, wherein the absorbent article comprises a plurality of projection-containing regions extending in a mutually parallel manner in the direction along the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article, a solid projection is respectively formed projecting from the sheet surface to the other surface, and projection-free regions are formed between the adjacent projection-containing regions, where on one surface of either the top sheet or the second sheet of the facing surfaces of the top sheet and the second sheet, while a flat surface is formed contacting the tip end of the projection, on the surface where the projection-containing regions are not formed in the top sheet or second sheet, of the facing surfaces of the top sheet and the second sheet, the flat surface having a plurality of adhesive-coated regions where an adhesive is respectively coated, formed at sections facing to the projection-containing regions and extending in a same direction as the projection-containing regions, and a plurality of non-adhesive-coated regions where an adhesive is not respectively coated, the top sheet and the second sheet being mutually joined at the sections where the projections of the projection-containing regions and the adhesive-coated regions of the flat surface are in mutual contact, and spaces being formed between the projection-free regions and the non-adhesive-coated regions, between the top sheet and the second sheet. [0007] (2) The absorbent article according to (1) above, wherein the second sheet is provided with the projection-containing regions on the top sheet surface, while the second sheet surface on the surface opposite the top sheet is formed flat. [0008] (3) The absorbent article according to (1) or (2) above, wherein the projections in the projection-containing regions are formed as protrusions interspersed on the sheet surface. [0009] (4) The absorbent article according to (1) or (2) above, wherein the projection-containing regions are formed as protruding ridges, extending continuously in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article. [0010] (5) The absorbent article according to (4) above, wherein the absorbent article is formed in a freely foldable manner in the lengthwise direction, based on a folding line extending in the widthwise direction, and the projection-containing regions are formed so as to exceed the folding line. [0011] (6) The absorbent article according to any one of (1) to (5), wherein the projection-containing regions are disposed in a region spanning a full length in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article, at locations corresponding to an interior area in the widthwise direction of the absorbent body. [0012] (7) The absorbent article according to any one of (1) to (6), wherein the absorbent body has concavoconvexities formed at a section contacting with the second sheet. (8) The absorbent article according to any one of (1) to (7), wherein the adhesive-coated regions have the adhesive coated in a straight linear manner. Advantageous Effects of Invention [0013] According to the invention, the top sheet and the second sheet are mutually joined at the projections in the projection-containing regions provided on either the top sheet or the second sheet, and at the sections where the adhesive-coated region are in mutual contact on the flat surface provided on the other surface, while spaces are formed between the projection-free regions and a non-adhesive-coated region, between the top sheet and the second sheet. This allows the second sheet and the top sheet to move integrally at sections where the projections and flat surface are joined, so that the top sheet flexibly contacts a skin of a user by an elastic force of the projections and maintains satisfactory comfort when worn. Furthermore, it is possible to prevent pooling of fluids between the projections and the flat surface due to separation between the projections and the flat surface. [0014] In addition, because the projections are solid, the projections are more resistant to collapse compared to the prior art, and since spaces are formed between the projection-free regions and the non-adhesive-coated regions between the second sheet and the top sheet, excreted fluid is rapidly absorbed and can be held between the second sheet and the top sheet, allowing excreted fluid absorption performance to be stably maintained. Furthermore, when some force acts in a thickness direction of the absorbent article, the spaces are collapsed, thereby alleviating the force, so that the top sheet can more flexibly contact with the skin of the user and increase comfort.

Description of Embodiments [0016] Fig. 1 to Fig. 6 show a first embodiment of the absorbent article of the invention, the explanation of this embodiment assuming that the absorbent article is an incontinence pad (which includes a panty liner that absorbs urine or menstrual blood, discharges or the like). Specifically, the incontinence pad 1 of this embodiment comprises a liquid-permeable top sheet 2, a liquid-impermeable back sheet 3 situated on one surface of the top sheet 2, an absorbent body 4 that is long in one direction, situated between the top sheet 2 and the back sheet 3, and a second sheet 5 situated between the absorbent body 4 and the top sheet 2. Also, the incontinence pad 1 as a whole is formed long in the direction along the lengthwise direction of the absorbent body 4. [0017] The top sheet 2 contacts a skin of a user and causes rapid absorption or penetration of excreted fluids such as urine from the user, causing them to migrate toward the second sheet 5 or absorbent body 4, the top sheet 2 being disposed on the surface of the absorbent body 4 facing the skin of the user (the top surface of the absorbent body 4 in Fig. 2). For this embodiment, the top sheet 2 is essentially the same shape as the shape when viewed from the surface opposite the back sheet 3 surface of the incontinence pad 1 (as "viewed flat"), and both edges in the lengthwise direction of the top sheet 2 are formed so as to be curved into outward convexities in the lengthwise direction of the top sheet 2 (creating an essentially oblong shape). Examples for the top sheet include ones formed from nonwoven fabrics, woven fabrics, liquid permeation hole-formed synthetic resin films and meshed net-like sheets, with nonwoven fabrics being preferred among these. Also, the top sheet 2 has an average basis weight of preferably 10 to 40 g/m2 and more preferably 20 to 30 g/m2, for the sheet as a whole. [0018] When a nonwoven fabric is used as the top sheet, the nonwoven fabric for the present invention may be, for example, natural fibers such as cotton, regenerated fibers such as rayon, inorganic fibers such as glass fibers, synthetic resin fibers such as polyethylene or polypropylene, or the like. The nonwoven fabric may be combined with composite fibers such as core-sheath fibers, side-by-side fibers and sea/island fibers, hollow type fibers; irregularly shaped fibers such as flat fibers, Y-shaped fibers or C-shaped fibers; solid crimped fibers such as latent crimped or developed crimped fibers, or split fibers that have been split by a physical load such as a water stream, heat, embossing or the like. [0019] Examples for the method of producing a nonwoven fabric include forming a web (fleece) and physically or chemically bonding the fibers together, where methods for forming a web include spunbond methods, dry methods (carding methods, spunbond methods, meltblown methods and airlaid methods), and wet methods, and bonding methods include thermal bond methods, chemical bond methods, needle punching methods, stitch bond methods and spunlace methods. Instead of a nonwoven fabric produced as described above, spunlace formed into a sheet by a hydroentangling method may be used as the top sheet 2. There may also be used for the top sheet a nonwoven fabric having concavoconvexities on the skin side (for example, a nonwoven fabric having a lower layer ide with heat-shrinkable fibers or the like, which contracts to form concavoconvexities on the upper layer, or a nonwoven fabric in which concavoconvexities are formed by applying air during web formation). Forming concavoconvexities on the skin side in this manner can reduce the contact area between the top sheet and the skin. [0020] The back sheet 3 is provided in the incontinence pad 1 on the underwear side of the user (the bottom side of the absorbent body 4 in Fig. 2) and prevents penetration of excreted fluid that has been discharged and prevents leakage to the underwear and elsewhere, and it has essentially the same shape as the shape of the incontinence pad 1 as viewed flat (and therefore essentially the same shape as the top sheet 2 as viewed flat) . The back sheet 3 and the top sheet 2 are mutually joined at the perimeter sections, sandwiching the absorbent body 4 and the second sheet 5 between them. The joining means used may be any desired means such as, for example, bonding with a hot-melt adhesive, bonding by heat embossing treatment or bonding by ultrasonic embossing treatment. According to the invention, the back sheet used may be, for example, a waterproof treated nonwoven fabric, a film of a synthetic resin (such as polyethylene or polypropylene), a composite sheet comprising a nonwoven fabric and a synthetic resin film (for example, a composite film having an air permeable synthetic resin film bonded to a spunbond or spunlace nonwoven fabric), or an SMS nonwoven fabric comprising a highly waterresistant meltblown nonwoven fabric sandwiched between high-strength spunbond nonwoven fabrics. [0021] On the surface of the back sheet 3 opposite the surface where the top sheet 2 is situated, i.e. on the surface that is to contact with underwear, there is disposed a pressure-sensitive adhesive member 6 for attachment of the incontinence pad 1 to the crotch section of underwear. Examples of pressure-sensitive adhesives to be used as the pressure-sensitive adhesive member 6 for the invention include styrene-based polymers such as styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene block copolymer, styrenebutylene polymer, styrene-butylene-styrene block copolymer and styrene-isobutylene-styrene copolymer; tackifiers such as C5 petroleum resins, C9 petroleum resins, dicyclopentadiene-based petroleum resins, rosinbased petroleum resins, polyterpene resins and terpenephenol resins; monomer plasticizers such as tricresyl phosphate, dibutyl phthalate and dioctyl phthalate; and polymer plasticizers such as vinyl polymer and polyester. [0022] Furthermore, the absorbent body 4 absorbs and holds fluids excreted by the user, such as urine, and it contains pulp and a water-absorbent polymer, the outer peripheral surface being covered by a cover sheet made of a nonwoven fabric (not shown). For this embodiment, the absorbent body 4 is formed so that both edges in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent body 4 are curved into outward convexities in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent body 4, creating a shape that is smaller than the top sheet 2 or the back sheet 3 (an essentially oblong shape). [0023] Examples of pulp to form the absorbent body of the invention include wood pulp obtained using a conifer or broadleaf tree material as the starting material (for example, mechanical pulp such as groundwood pulp, refiner ground pulp, thermomechanical pulp and chemithermomechanical pulp; chemical pulp such as Kraft pulp, sulfide pulp and alkaline pulp; and semichemical pulp); mercerized pulp or crosslinked pulp obtained by chemical treatment of wood pulp; nonwood pulp such as bagasse, kenaf, bamboo, hemp and cotton (for example, cotton linter); regenerated cellulose such as rayon and fibril rayon; and semi-synthetic celluloses such as acetates and triacetates, among which ground pulp is preferred from the viewpoint of low cost and easy shaping. On the other hand, examples of water-absorbent polymers to form the absorbent body of the invention include polyacrylic acid salt-based, polysulfonic acid salt-based, maleic anhydride salt-based, polyacrylamidebased, polyvinyl alcohol-based, polyethylene oxide-based, polyaspartic acid salt-based, polyglutamic acid salt-based, polyalginic acid salt-based, starch-based and cellulose-based high water-absorbent resins (Superabsorbent Polymers: SAP), among which polyacrylic acid salt-based (especially sodium polyacrylate-based) high water-absorbent resins are preferred. [0024] The second sheet 5 absorbs excreted fluids from the top sheet 2 and causes them to migrate into the absorbent body 4. For this embodiment, the second sheet 5 extends in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent body 4, and has a smaller length in the widthwise direction than the shape of the absorbent body 4 as viewed flat, with an essentially elliptical shape having a length in the lengthwise direction that is approximately the same as the length of the top sheet 2 or back sheet 3 (that is, its length in the lengthwise direction is the same as the incontinence pad 1). Also, the second sheet 5 is disposed between the top sheet 2 and the absorbent body 4 so that the center location of the second sheet 5 in the widthwise direction matches the center location of the absorbent body 4 in the widthwise direction, the second sheet 5 as a whole being located in the interior area in the widthwise direction of the absorbent body 4. [0025] Also, similar to the top sheet 2, the second sheet 5 may be formed from a nonwoven fabric, woven fabric, liquid permeation hole-formed synthetic resin film, meshed net-like sheet or the like, although a nonwoven fabric is preferred among these. The second sheet 5 has an average basis weight of preferably 10 to 40 g/m2 and more preferably 20 to 30 g/m2, for the sheet as a whole. [0026] As shown in Figs. 3 to 5, the second sheet 5 is provided with a plurality of projection-containing regions 10 in which projections 11 are formed on the sheet surface on the top sheet 2 side, protruding from the sheet surface to the top sheet 2 side, the regions extending in the direction along the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 1, i.e. in the lengthwise direction of the second sheet 5. The plurality of projection-containing regions 10 are disposed in a mutually parallel manner, aligned at a fixed spacing in the widthwise direction of the second sheet 5. The second sheet 5 is also provided with a plurality of projection-free regions 12 where the projections 11 are not present, formed between the other adjacent projection-containing regions 10 among the plurality of projection-containing regions 10. These projection-free regions 12 are all formed with flat surfaces on the top sheet 2 side, and are mutually parallel in the direction along the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 1, i.e. in the lengthwise direction of the second sheet 5, while extending along the lengthwise edges of the adjacent projection-containing regions 10. Thus, the projection-containing regions 10 and the projection-free regions 12 are disposed in an alternate arrangement in the widthwise direction of the second sheet 5. The thicknesses of the sections of the plurality of projection-free regions 12 of the second sheet 5 are all approximately the same. [0027] For this embodiment, the projection-containing regions 10 are all disposed at locations corresponding to the interior area in the widthwise direction of the absorbent body 4. As mentioned above, the second sheet 5, in terms of the second sheet 5 as a whole, is located in the interior area in the widthwise direction of the absorbent body 4. Thus, the projection-containing regions 10 are all disposed at locations corresponding to the interior area in the widthwise direction of the absorbent body 4. Furthermore, the projection-containing regions 10 are disposed in a region across the full length in the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 1. As mentioned above, the second sheet 5 is formed to approximately the same length as the top sheet 2 or back sheet 3 in the lengthwise direction, and therefore each of the projection-containing regions 10 is formed across the full length in the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 1. Thus, the projection-containing regions 10 are all situated in the region spanning the full length in the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 1, at locations corresponding to the interior area in the widthwise direction of the absorbent body 4. [0028] The plurality of projection-containing regions 10 all have the same mutual widths. The plurality of projection-free regions 12 also all have the same mutual widths. Furthermore, the projection-containing regions 10 and the projection-free regions 12 are formed so that the width Wi of the projection-containing regions 10 and the width W2 of the projection-free regions 12 are in a fixed relationship. The width Wi of the projection-containing regions 10 and the width W2 of the projection-free regions 12 are preferably such that the ratio Wi/W2 of the widths of both regions is 1 to 3. The ratio is more preferably 1.5 to 2. If the ratio W1/W2 is 1 to 3, the spaces 16 described hereunder will be resistant to collapse and the flat surface 13 described hereunder will be resistant to sagging, and therefore contact of the flat surface 13 with the projection-free regions 12 will be more stably inhibited. [0029] The projections 11 are all solid, or in other words, the fibers forming the second sheet 5 inside the projections 11 are formed in a packed state. This increases the elastic force of the projections 11 by the fibers forming the projections 11, providing higher elasticity compared to hollow projections (for example, where the second sheet is formed with an essentially wavy cross-section). Furthermore, while the projections 11 are solid, the second sheet 5 is formed flat at the surface on the surface opposite the top sheet 2, i.e. the surface on the absorbent body 4 side. If the surface of the second sheet 5 on the surface opposite the top sheet 2 is thus flat, an advantage is provided in that collapse of the spaces 16, described hereunder, is kept to an absolute minimum even when the incontinence pad 1 (especially the second sheet 5) has deformed along the surface of the skin of the user. [0030] For this embodiment, the projections 11 are all formed with essentially circular shapes as viewed flat, and are interspersed on the sheet surface on the top sheet 2 side of the second sheet 5, as essentially hemispherical projections with the same shapes and sizes in a fixed regular pattern. Specifically, the projections 11 are provided at fixed spacings (mutually equal spacings for this embodiment) in each of the plurality of projection-containing regions 10. Also, the widths on the base sides of each projection 11 (the diameters in this case) are all approximately the same width as the width Wi of the projection-containing region 10. Thus, each of the projections 11 in each of the projection-containing regions 10 is disposed in a roughly linear manner in the same projection-containing region 10, and the section corresponding to the center in the widthwise direction of the projection-containing region 10 is where the protrusion is at its highest. By thus forming the projections 11 as protrusions interspersed on the sheet surface, when the incontinence pad 1 bends in the lengthwise direction or the widthwise direction in response to movement by the user, and also when it bends in a complex manner in the lengthwise direction and the widthwise direction, the projections 11 do not inhibit bending of the incontinence pad 1. In addition, since the spaces 16, described hereunder, tend to be the origins of bending of the incontinence pad 1, the incontinence pad 1 easily follows the body of the user . [0031] Incidentally, the sections on the surface of the top sheet 2 side of each projection-containing region 10 where the projections 11 are not present are flat surfaces, and their thicknesses are approximately the same as the thickness Ik of the projection-free regions 12 . In addition, the size of each projection 11 in the thickness direction of the second sheet 5, i.e. the projection Τΐ of the projection 11, may be any desired size so long as it is larger than the thickness T2 of the projection-free region 12, but it is preferably about 1.5 to 3.0 times that thickness. It is more preferably 1.5 to 2 times the thickness. If the projection Τΐ of the projection 11 is 1.5 to 3.0 times the projection of the thickness T2 of the projection-free region 12, then the spaces 16 described hereunder will be resistant to collapse even when force has acted on the incontinence pad 1 in the thickness direction, and the projections of the projections 11 themselves will be easily maintained. [0032] When a second sheet having a plurality of solid projections 11 formed therein is produced using a nonwoven fabric, the method used may be any desired one, and for example, a method of heat stretching heat-extendable fibers and/or heat shrinkage of heat-shrinkable fibers may be utilized. First, a method of utilizing heat stretching of heat-extendable fibers and heat shrinkage of heat-shrinkable fibers may be the method described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2012-5701 or elsewhere. According to this method, a laminated sheet having a heat-extendable fiber layer on a skin side (a top sheet side in the case of this embodiment) and a heat-shrinkable fiber layer partially joined to the heat-extendable fiber layer by joining sections, on a surface opposite the skin side (the absorbent body side in this case), is subjected to heat treatment, and heat stretching of the heat-extendable fiber layer and heat shrinkage of the heat-shrinkable fiber layer causes the skin side of the heat-extendable fiber layer to bulge, thereby allowing production of a nonwoven fabric having a sheet surface with a plurality of projections formed therein. The heat-extendable fibers in the heat-extendable fiber layer may be fibers whose actual fiber lengths extend by heat treatment (for example, fibers wherein a resin crystal state is altered so that the actual fiber lengths extend), or fibers whose actual fiber lengths do not extend but whose apparent fiber lengths extend by heat treatment (for example, crimped fibers wherein developed zigzag, Ω-shaped or spiral-shaped crimping is released such that the apparent fiber lengths extend). Various different heat-extendable fibers are known (for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-218183, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2005-350836, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2007-303035, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2007-204899, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2007-204901, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2007-204902 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2008-101285), and may be selected as appropriate. The heat-shrinkable fibers in the heat-shrinkable fiber layer may be fibers whose actual fiber lengths are shortened by heat treatment, or fibers whose actual fiber lengths are not shortened but whose apparent fiber lengths are shortened by heat treatment (for example, latent crimping fibers wherein developed zigzag, Ω-shaped or spiral-shaped crimping develops such that the apparent fiber lengths are shortened). Various different types of heat-shrinkable fibers are also known (for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 9-296325, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2-191720 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2007-177335), and they may be appropriately selected for use. The joining sections where the heat-extendable fiber layer and the heat-shrinkable fiber layer are partially joined are, for example, recesses formed by heat embossing treatment. The joining sections may be situated in a zigzag lattice-like fashion as viewed flat, for example. One region surrounded by a plurality of joining sections bulges out to the skin side starting from the joining sections, forming one projection, and therefore the number of joining sections and their locations, etc. are appropriately adjusted in consideration of the projection formability, bulk and the like . [0033] Also, a method utilizing heat shrinkage of heat-shrinkable fibers may be, for example, a method as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002- 187228, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003- 247155, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2007-177340 or elsewhere. According to these methods, heat treatment is carried out on a laminated sheet having a non-heat-shrinkable fiber layer on the skin side and having a heat-shrinkable fiber layer partially joined to the non-heat-shrinkable fiber layer by joining sections, on the surface opposite the skin side, and the non-heat-shrinkable fiber layer is caused to bulge on the skin side by heat shrinkage of the heat-shrinkable fiber layer, thereby allowing production of a nonwoven fabric having a sheet surface with a plurality of projections formed therein. The non-heat-shrinkable fibers in the non-heat-shrinkable fiber layer may be fibers having essentially no heat shrinking property, or they may be fibers having a heat shrinking property but having a heat shrinkage initiation temperature that is higher than the heat shrinkage initiation temperature of the heat-shrinkable fibers in the heat-shrinkable fiber layer (that is, fibers that essentially do not undergo heat shrinkage at a temperature up to the heat shrinkage initiation temperature of the heat-shrinkable fibers in the heat-shrinkable fiber layer). Examples of non-heat-shrinkable fibers include regenerated fibers such as rayon; semisynthetic fibers such as acetate; natural fibers such as cotton and wool; and thermoplastic resin fibers such as polyolefins (for example, polyethylene and polypropylene), polyesters (for example, polyethylene terephthalate) and polyamides. The definitions and specific examples of heat-shrinkable fibers and the joining sections are the same as described above. [0034] In addition, a method utilizing heat stretching of heat-extendable fibers may be the method described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2005-350836 or Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2010-168715, for example. According to these methods, heat treatment is carried out on a laminated sheet having a heat-extendable fiber layer on the skin side and having non-heat-extendable fiber layer partially joined to the heat-extendable fiber layer by joining sections, on the surface opposite the skin side, and the heat-extendable fiber layer is caused to bulge on the skin side by heat stretching of the heat-extendable fiber layer, thereby allowing production of a nonwoven fabric having a sheet surface with a plurality of projections formed therein. The non-heat-extendable fibers in the non-heat-extendable fiber layer may be fibers having essentially no heat extensibility, or they may be fibers having heat extensibility but having a higher heat stretching initiation temperature than the heat stretching initiation temperature of the heat-extendable fibers in the heat-extendable fiber layer (that is, fibers that essentially do not undergo heat stretching at a temperature up to the heat stretching initiation temperature of the heat-extendable fibers in the heat-extendable fiber layer). Examples of non-heat-extendable fibers include regenerated fibers such as rayon; semisynthetic fibers such as acetate; natural fibers such as cotton and wool; and thermoplastic resin fibers such as polyolefins (for example, polyethylene and polypropylene), polyesters (for example, polyethylene terephthalate) and polyamides. The definitions and specific examples of heat-extendable fibers and the joining sections are the same as described above. [0035] On the other hand, the second sheet surface of the top sheet 2 that is facing the second sheet 5 is the flat surface 13 that has been formed flat. The term "flat", for the purpose of the present invention, means essentially flat as a whole, where there is no formation of the projections in the sheet such as the top sheet, back sheet or second sheet, and may include concavoconvexities by bonding with another sheet or the like, or concavoconvexities on the sheet surface that are unavoidable during sheet formation. [0036] Also, the flat surface 13 is provided with a plurality of adhesive-coated regions 14 coated with an adhesive, formed in the sections facing the projection-containing regions 10 and extending in the same direction as the projection-containing regions 10, and a plurality of non-adhesive-coated regions 15 that are not coated with an adhesive. The plurality of adhesive-coated regions 14 are disposed facing the projection-containing regions 10, the adhesive-coated regions 14 being formed to have essentially the same lengthwise lengths and widthwise lengths as the lengths in the lengthwise direction and the lengths in the widthwise direction of the facing (opposing) projection-containing regions 10. Thus, the adhesive-coated regions 14 are disposed on the flat surface 13, arranged at the same fixed spacing as the projection-containing regions 10 in the widthwise direction of the top sheet 2. Furthermore, according to this embodiment, the adhesive-coated regions 14 are respectively coated with the adhesive in a prescribed coating pattern across the entire length. [0037] In addition, the plurality of non-adhesive-coated regions 15 are disposed facing the projection-free regions 12, each of the non-adhesive-coated regions 15 being formed to have essentially the same lengthwise lengths and widthwise lengths as the lengths in the lengthwise direction and the lengths in the widthwise direction of the facing (opposing) projection-free regions 12. Furthermore, the non-adhesive-coated regions 15 extend between the adjacent adhesive-coated regions 14, along the lengthwise edges of those adhesive-coated regions 14. Thus, the non-adhesive-coated regions 15 are disposed on the flat surface 13, at the same fixed spacing as the plurality of projection-free regions 12 in the widthwise direction of the top sheet 2. Consequently, the adhesive-coated regions 14 and the non-adhesive-coated regions 15 are disposed on the flat surface 13 of the top sheet 2, in an alternating arrangement in the widthwise direction of the top sheet 2 . [0038] Incidentally, the adhesive coated onto the adhesive-coated regions 14 may be any desired adhesive so long as it can reliably and stably bond between the projections 11 and the flat surface 13, but a hot-melt adhesive is most preferred. According to the invention, examples of hot-melt adhesives include polyolefin-based, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer-based and synthetic rubber-based adhesives. Other adhesives that may be used include acrylic resin-based pressure-sensitive adhesives. [0039] The coating pattern of the adhesive may be any desired one, and for example, there may be used any desired coating pattern such as a spiral, omega (Ω) , folding line, curved line or straight line (bead) form, or a band-shape that is wider than a straight linear coating pattern. The adhesive coating pattern is preferably coating of the adhesive in a straight linear manner in the adhesive-coated regions 14. Also, the adhesive is more preferably coated at the center sections in the widthwise direction of the adhesive-coated regions 14, in a straight linear manner across the full length in the lengthwise direction of the adhesive-coated regions 14. This will allow the tip ends of the projections 11 in the projection-containing regions 10, and particularly the portions located on the top sheet side, to bond to the flat surface 13 and stably maintain the distances between the projection-free regions 12 and the non-adhesive-coated regions 15, to allow the spaces 16 described below to be reliably formed. In addition, it will be possible to reduce seepage of the adhesive from the adhesive-coated regions 14 to the non-adhesive-coated regions 15 when the projections 11 and the flat surface 13 have been joined, to prevent bonding between the projection-free regions 12 and the non-adhesive-coated regions 15, and to more stably and reliably form the spaces 16. [0040] Furthermore, the method of coating the adhesive may be any desired method depending on the adhesive coating pattern, including a method of injecting the adhesive through one or a plurality of nozzles and coating different linear or punctiform coating patterns, a method of contacting it with the section that is to be coated using a roll or the like to coat the adhesive on the surface or as a surface dot pattern, or a method of injecting and coating the adhesive through a nozzle in the shape of a band. The coating coverage for the adhesive will depend on the length of the adhesive-coated regions 15 and the adhesive coating pattern, but it is preferably 5 to 20 g/m2 and more preferably about 10 to 15 g/m2. If the adhesive coating coverage is 5 to 20 g/m2, it will be possible to prevent a condition of insufficient adhesive force that results in inadequate joining with the projections 11, while also avoiding easy detachment, and to also prevent hardening of the top sheet 2 or projections 11 by the adhesive, to absolutely minimize stiffness. [0041] Furthermore, the top sheet 2 and the second sheet 5 are mutually bonded and joined at the sections of mutual contact between the tip ends of the projections 11 in the projection-containing regions 10 and the adhesive coated on the adhesive-coated regions 14 of the flat surface 13. On the other hand, the aforementioned spaces 16 are formed between the projection-free regions 12 and the non-adhesive-coated regions 15 between the top sheet 2 and the second sheet 5, where there is no joining between the top sheet 2 and the second sheet 5. [0042] The spaces 16 are formed by the top sheet 2 being supported by the projections 11 in the direction away from the second sheet 5. Incidentally, because both ends in the lengthwise direction of the second sheet 5 overlap with the sections where the top sheet 2 and the back sheet 3 are joined at the perimeter sections, the projections 11 of the second sheet 5 at those sections are compressed and collapse in the thickness direction, such that the spaces 16 are essentially not formed. Also, the sections of the projection-containing regions 10 other than the projections 11 preferably are basically not joined with the adhesive-coated regions 14 by the adhesive, and therefore according to this embodiment the non-joined sections of the projection-containing regions 10 and the adhesive-coated regions 14 form spaces connecting with the spaces 16, and can exhibit the same function as the spaces 16. [0043] Incidentally, concavoconvexities are formed in the absorbent body 4 at the sections contacting with the second sheet 5. For this embodiment, a plurality of compressed grooves 17 are formed by embossing together with the top sheet 2 and the second sheet 5, the compressed grooves 17 creating a structure with concavoconvexities formed on the surface contacting with the second sheet 5. During formation of the compressed grooves 17, the layered body obtained by layering the top sheet 2 with the back sheet 3, second sheet 5 and absorbent body 4 passes through a pair of upper and lower rolls in the embossing apparatus. One of the rolls in the embossing apparatus is an embossing roll having on the outer peripheral surface protruding sections shaped to correspond to the compressed grooves 17, while the other roll is a plain roll having a smooth outer peripheral surface. When the layered body passes between the upper and lower pair of rolls in the embossing apparatus, the layered body becomes compressed in the thickness direction matching the shapes of the protruding sections of the embossing roll, so that the compressed grooves 17 are formed in the layered body. This causes the top sheet 2 and the second sheet 5, as well as the absorbent body 4, to become joined by the compressed grooves 17, and concavoconvexities are formed at some of the sections of the absorbent body 4 contacting with the second sheet. By thus forming concavoconvexities at the sections of the absorbent body 4 contacting with the second sheet 5, spaces are formed between the second sheet 5 and the absorbent body 5, and therefore similar to the spaces 16 between the top sheet 2 and the second sheet 5, excreted fluid is rapidly absorbed and held, and when some force has acted in the thickness direction of the incontinence pad 1, the spaces collapse and alleviate the force, providing further improvement in flexibility of the top sheet for the skin of the user. [0044] The incontinence pad 1 having such a construction has the second sheet 5 and the top sheet 2 joined at the sections of mutual contact between the projections 11 of the projection-containing regions 10 provided in the second sheet 5, and the adhesive-coated regions 14 on the flat surface 13 provided in the top sheet 2. Meanwhile, spaces 16 are formed between the projection-free regions 12 and the non-adhesive-coated regions 15 between the top sheet 2 and the second sheet 5. During that time, the second sheet 5 and the top sheet 2 move integrally at the sections where the projections 11 and the flat surface 13 are joined, so that the top sheet 2 flexibly contacts the skin of the user by the elastic force of the projections 11. This allows comfort to be satisfactorily maintained when the incontinence pad 1 is worn, and also prevents pooling of fluids between the projections 11 and the flat surface 13 resulting from separation between the projections 11 and the flat surface 13. [0045] In addition, because the projections 11 are solid, the projections 11 are more resistant to collapse compared to the prior art, and since spaces 16 are formed between the projection-free regions 12 and the non-adhesive-coated regions 15 between the second sheet 5 and the top sheet 2, excreted fluid is rapidly absorbed and can be held between the second sheet 5 and the top sheet 2, allowing excreted fluid absorption performance to be stably maintained. In addition, when some external force has acted in the thickness direction of the incontinence pad 1 by movement of the user, or the like, the spaces 16 become collapsed, thereby alleviating the external force, so that the top sheet 2 can more flexibly contact with the skin of the user and comfort can be increased. Conversely, when the external force is removed, the shapes of the projections promptly recover by the elastic force of the projections 11, allowing the shapes of the spaces 16 to rapidly recover, so that absorbing power of the incontinence pad 1 can be promptly restored. [0046] Fig. 7 to Fig. 10 show a second embodiment of the invention, wherein the use of an incontinence pad as an absorbent article is described, similar to the first embodiment. In the incontinence pad 21 of this embodiment, the shapes of the projections in the projection-containing regions, and the specific constructions of the liquid-permeable top sheet 22 and the second sheet 25 situated between the absorbent body 4 and the top sheet 22, differ from the first embodiment. The construction other than the top sheet 22 and the second sheet 25 is essentially the same as the first embodiment and is indicated by like reference numerals, and its explanation will be omitted here. [0047] As shown in Fig. 7, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, the second sheet 25 is provided with a plurality of projection-containing regions 30 in which projections 31 are formed on the sheet surface on the top sheet 22 side, protruding from the sheet surface to the top sheet 22 side, the regions extending in the direction along the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 21, i.e. in the lengthwise direction of the second sheet 25. The plurality of projection-containing regions 30 are disposed in a mutually parallel manner, aligned at a fixed spacing in the widthwise direction of the second sheet 25. [0048] Also, the second sheet 25 is provided with a plurality of projection-free regions 32 where the projections 31 are not present, formed between the other adjacent projection-containing regions 30, 30 among the plurality of projection-containing regions 30. These projection-free regions 32 are all formed with flat surfaces on the top sheet 22, and are mutually parallel in the direction along the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 21, i.e. in the lengthwise direction of the second sheet 25, while extending along the lengthwise edges of the adjacent projection-containing regions 30. Thus, the projection-containing regions 30 and the projection-free regions 32 are disposed in an alternate arrangement in the widthwise direction of the second sheet 25. Also, the thicknesses of the sections of the plurality of projection-free regions 32 of the second sheet 25 are all approximately the same. Incidentally, the projection-containing regions 30 are the same as the projection-containing regions 10 of the first embodiment, in that they are disposed at a location corresponding to the interior area in the widthwise direction of the absorbent body 4, in a region across the full length in the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 21. [0049] The plurality of projection-containing regions 30 all have the same mutual widths. In addition, the plurality of projection-free regions 32 also all have the same mutual widths. Furthermore, the projection-containing regions 30 and the projection-free regions 32 are formed so that the width W3 of the projection-containing regions 30 and the width W4 of the projection-free regions 32 are in a fixed relationship. The width W3 of the projection-containing regions 30 and the width W4 of the projection-free regions 32 are preferably such that the ratio W3/W4 of the widths of both regions is 1.2 to 3.0. The ratio is more preferably 1.5 to 2. If the ratio W3/W4 is 1.2 to 3.0 times, then the spaces 36 described hereunder will be resistant to collapse even when force has acted on the incontinence pad 21 in the thickness direction, and the projections of the projections 31 themselves will be easily maintained. [0050] The projections 31 formed in the projection-containing regions 30 are all solid, or in other words, are formed in a state with the fibers forming the second sheet 25 being packed in the interiors of the projections 31, as shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, and are therefore in a state with higher elasticity than if they were hollow. Furthermore, while the projections 31 are solid, the second sheet 25 is formed flat at the surface on the sheet opposite the top sheet 22 side, i.e. the surface on the absorbent body 4 side. [0051] Furthermore, in regard to the projections 31, all of the projections 31 of the projection-containing regions 30 are formed as protruding ridges extending continuously in the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 21, i.e. in the lengthwise direction of the second sheet 25, and specifically in the direction in which the projection-containing regions 30 are laid out. More specifically, the projections 31 of this embodiment are formed to have essentially semicircular cross-sections, with surfaces curved so as to protrude toward the top sheet 22 side, and they are provided over the entire respective areas of the projection-containing regions 10. Also, the widths on the base side of each projection 31 are all approximately the same width as the width W3 of the projection-containing region 30. Thus, each of the projections 31 in each projection-containing region 30 is situated in a roughly linear manner within the projection-containing region 30 in which the projection 31 is formed. Thus, the second sheet 25 has a ridge-furrow structure comprising a plurality of projections 31 and furrows 37, wherein the projection-containing regions 30 are formed as protruding ridges by the projections 31, while the projection-free regions 32 between the adjacent projection-containing regions 30, 30 are essentially concave furrows 37. [0052] Also, as the projection-containing regions 30 are disposed across the full length in the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 21, the projections 31 extend continuously across the full length in the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 21. Consequently, when the incontinence pad 21 is to be shipped as a product, the incontinence pad 21 is formed in a freely foldable manner in the lengthwise direction by triple-folding, for example, in the lengthwise direction based on the folding lines 1, m extending in the widthwise direction as shown in Fig. 1, in which case the projection-containing regions 30 are all formed crossing over the folding lines 1, m. Thus, since projections 31 are present in the locations of the projection-containing regions 30 crossing over the folding lines 1, m, the elastic force of the projections 31 allows easier development from the folded state of the incontinence pad 21, resulting in rapid recovery of the surface on the top sheet 22 side from the folded state of the incontinence pad 21 and making it resistant to loss of comfort. Incidentally, the size of each projection 31 in the thickness direction of the second sheet 25, i.e. the projection Τ3 of the projection 31, may be any desired size so long as it is larger than the thickness T4 of the projection-free region 32, but it is preferably about 1 to 3 times that thickness. It is more preferably 1.5 to 2 times the thickness. If the projection Τ3 of the projection 31 is 1.5 to 3 times the thickness T4 of the projection-free region 32, the spaces 36 described hereunder will be resistant to collapse and the flat surface 33 described hereunder will be resistant to sagging, so that contact of the flat surface 33 with the projection-free regions 32 will can be inhibited. [0054] The second sheet 25 is preferably formed of a nonwoven fabric. A nonwoven fabric comprising a ridge-furrow structure composed of projection-containing regions 30 and projection-free regions 32 such as the second sheet 25 can be produced, for example, by forming the ridge-furrow structure in a web (fleece) containing thermoplastic resin fibers, and then blasting it with hot air for heat fusion of the sections where the thermoplastic resin fibers are crossing in the web. [0055] The method used to form the ridge-furrow structure in the web may be any desired method, and the methods described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2008-25079, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2008- 23326 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2009- 30218 may be mentioned as examples. According to these methods, the web is placed on an air-permeable supporting member (for example, a net-like supporting member) , and the air-permeable supporting member is moved in a prescribed direction while blasting a gas (usually air) continuously onto the top side of the web, to form a ridge-furrow structure in the web. In the region in which the gas is blasted, furrows 37 are formed running along the movement direction of the air-permeable supporting member, while protruding ridge-like projections 31 (ridges) are formed between every two adjacent furrows 37 of the projection-free regions 32. During this time, the fibers in the regions that have been blasted with gas migrate to both sides of the furrows 37, so that the basis weight of the projections 31 will generally be higher than the basis weight of the furrows 37. The number of projections 31 and furrows 37, as well as their spacing, basis weights, fiber densities, etc. may be adjusted within the desired range by adjusting the number of nozzles, the orifice diameter and pitch, the temperature and spray volume of the gas sprayed from the nozzle, the tension of the web, and the like . [0056] The thermoplastic resin composing the thermoplastic resin fibers in the web may be a polyolefin, polyester, polyamide or the like. Examples of polyolefins include straight-chain low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), medium-density polyethylene (MDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene, polybutylene, and copolymers composed mainly of the foregoing (for example, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer (ΕΕΑ), ethyleneacrylic acid copolymer (ΕΑΑ) or an ionomer resin). Examples of polyesters include polyesters of straightchain or branched polyhydroxyalkanoic acids up to C20, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polytrimethylene terephthalate (ΡΤΤ), polybutylene terephthalate (ΡΒΤ), polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid, copolymers composed mainly thereof, and copolymerized polyesters composed mainly of alkylene terephthalates copolymerized with a small amount of another component. Examples of polyamides include 6-nylon and 6,6-nylon. The thermoplastic resin fibers are preferably subjected to hydrophilicizing treatment. Hydrophilicizing treatment of the thermoplastic resin fibers may be, for example, treatment utilizing a surfactant, hydrophilic agent or the like (for example, kneading of a surfactant into the fiber interiors, or coating of the fiber surfaces with a surfactant), or plasma processing or the like. [0057] The thermoplastic resin fibers may be composed of a single type of thermoplastic resin, but preferably they are composite fibers comprising two or more different thermoplastic resins. Preferred composite fibers are core-sheath composite fibers. The thermoplastic resin forming the sheath component of core-sheath composite fibers is selected as a thermoplastic resin with a melting point that is lower than the melting point of the thermoplastic resin forming the core component. Examples of thermoplastic resins forming the core component and sheath component of core-sheath composite fibers include olefin-based resins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, polyamide-based resins such as nylon, and polyester-based resins, polyacrylonitrile-based resins and the like. The thermoplastic resin forming the sheath component is preferably polyethylene (for example, high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene, or a mixture of such types of polyethylene), and the thermoplastic resin forming the core component is preferably polypropylene or polyester. Core-sheath composite fibers preferably have approximately matching center locations for the core component and sheath component, and do not exhibit spiral crimping by heating. [0058] On the other hand, the second sheet surface of the top sheet 22 that is facing the second sheet 25 is the flat surface 33 that has been formed flat. The definition of "flat" here is the same as explained above. The flat surface 33 is provided with a plurality of adhesive-coated regions 34 coated with an adhesive, formed in the sections facing (opposing) the projection-containing regions 30 and extending in the same direction as the projection-containing regions 30, and a plurality of non-adhesive-coated regions 35 that are not coated with an adhesive. The plurality of adhesive-coated regions 34 are disposed facing the projection-containing regions 30, each of the adhesive-coated regions 34 being formed to have essentially the same lengthwise lengths and widthwise lengths as the lengths in the lengthwise direction and the lengths in the widthwise direction of the facing (opposing) projection-containing regions 30. Thus, the adhesive-coated regions 34 are disposed on the flat surface 33, arranged at the same spacing as the projection-containing regions 30 in the widthwise direction of the top sheet 22. Furthermore, the adhesive-coated regions 34 are respectively coated with the adhesive in a prescribed coating pattern across the full lengths and the full widths of each of the adhesive-coated regions 34. [0059] In addition, the plurality of non-adhesive-coated regions 35 are disposed facing the projection-free regions 32, each of the non-adhesive-coated regions 35 being formed to have essentially the same lengthwise lengths and widthwise lengths as the lengths in the lengthwise direction and the lengths in the widthwise direction of the facing (opposing) projection-free regions 32. Furthermore, the non-adhesive-coated regions 35 are disposed between the adjacent adhesive-coated regions 34, extending along the lengthwise edges of the adhesive-coated regions 34, the non-adhesive-coated regions 35 being disposed on the flat surface 33 at the same spacing as the projection-free regions 30 in the widthwise direction of the top sheet 22. Consequently, the adhesive-coated regions 34 and the non-adhesive-coated regions 35 are disposed in an alternate arrangement on the flat surface 33 of the top sheet 22. [0060] The type of adhesive coated onto the adhesive-coated regions 35, the coating pattern and the coating method are the same as for the adhesive-coated regions 15 of the first embodiment. The adhesive coating coverage will depend on the lengths of the adhesive-coated regions 35 and the adhesive coating pattern, but for this embodiment it is preferably 5 to 20 g/m2 and more preferably about 10 to 15 g/m2, similar to the first embodiment. If the adhesive coating coverage is 5 to 20 g/m2, it will be possible to prevent a condition of insufficient adhesive force that results in inadequate joining with the projections 31, while also avoiding easy detachment, and to also prevent hardening of the top sheet 22 or projections 31 by the adhesive, to absolutely minimize stiffness. [0061] Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 8, the top sheet 22 and the second sheet 25 are mutually bonded and joined at the sections of mutual contact between the tip ends of the projections 31 in the projection-containing regions 30 and the adhesive coated on the adhesive-coated regions 34 of the flat surface 33. On the other hand, the aforementioned spaces 36 are formed between the projection-free regions 32 and the non-adhesive-coated regions 35 between the top sheet 22 and the second sheet 25, where there is no joining between the top sheet 22 and the second sheet 25. The spaces 36 are formed by the top sheet 22 being supported by the projections 31 in the direction away from the second sheet 25. In the case of this embodiment, since the second sheet 25 has a ridge-furrow structure on the top sheet 22 side, the spaces 36 have structures extending in the lengthwise direction of the top sheet 22 and the second sheet 25, or in other words, in the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 21. Incidentally, because both ends in the lengthwise direction of the second sheet 25 overlap with the sections where the top sheet 22 and the back sheet 23 are joined at the perimeter sections, the projections 31 of the second sheet 25 at those sections are compressed and collapse in the thickness direction, such that the spaces 36 are essentially not formed. [0062] The incontinence pad 21 having such a construction has the second sheet 25 and the top sheet 22 joined at the sections of mutual contact between the protruding ridge-like projections 31 of the projection-containing regions 30 provided on the second sheet 25, and the adhesive-coated regions 34 of the flat surface 33 provided on the top sheet 22. Meanwhile, spaces 36 are formed between the projection-free regions 32 and the non-adhesive-coated regions 35 (furrows 38) between the top sheet 22 and the second sheet 25. Thus, it is possible to obtain basically the same effect as with the first embodiment. In addition, since the projections 31 are formed as protruding ridges extending continuously in the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 21, this is advantageous in terms of air permeability in the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 21, compared to the first embodiment. [0063] In the first and second embodiments, the construction is such that the projection-containing regions 10, 30 are provided on the top sheet 2, 22 surface of the second sheet 5, 25 while the flat surface 13, 33 is formed on the second sheet 5, 25 side of the top sheet 2, 22. However, the construction may also be one wherein projection-containing regions are provided on the second sheet side of the top sheet while the top sheet side of the second sheet is flattened. Nevertheless, when the projections are formed with the projection-containing regions provided on the second sheet as in the first and second embodiments, since the second sheet is in contact with the absorbent body, an advantage is provided in that, even when the absorbent body expands upon absorption and holding of excreted fluid, the absorbent body can easily absorb pressure on the skin of the user along with expansion of the absorbent body. Moreover, even when the projection-containing regions are provided on the second sheet side of the top sheet, the projections formed in the projection-containing regions may of course be projections interspersed on the sheet surface, or they may be protruding ridge-like forms extending continuously in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article. Furthermore, whether the projection-containing regions are provided on the top sheet or whether they are provided on the second sheet, when the projections are projections interspersed on the sheet surface, the spacing between projections in the same projection-containing region may be of any size, and it may differ from the spacing between projections of the other projection-containing regions. [0064] In the first and second embodiments, the projection-containing regions 10, 30 are disposed in regions across the full length in the lengthwise direction of the incontinence pad 1, 21, at locations corresponding to the interior area in the widthwise direction of the absorbent body 4, but the locations of the projection-containing regions may be any desired locations so long as excreted fluid absorption performance can be stably maintained and comfort during wear can be satisfactorily preserved, by the locations of the projection-free regions and the relationship between the projections and the spaces. [0065] In the first and second embodiments, the absorbent body 4 has concavoconvexities formed by compressed grooves 17 at the sections in contact with the second sheet 5, 25, but it is not absolutely necessary to provide concavoconvexities at the sections of the absorbent body in contact with the second sheet. Even when such concavoconvexities are provided, the concavoconvexities may be provided by any of various means such as embossing, only at the sections of the absorbent body in contact with the second sheet. [0066] These embodiments were described assuming an incontinence pad (including a panty liner) as an example of an absorbent article, but the absorbent article of the invention may be, instead of an incontinence pad, any type of absorbent article such as a sanitary napkin, disposable diaper, urine-absorbing pad or the like.
