This application is a national stage application (under 35 U.S.C. §371) of PCT/US12/050298, filed Aug. 10, 2012. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Consumers are typically drawn to cosmetic compositions for a variety of reasons, including the intensity of the colors provided by the compositions. For example, color formulations in cosmetics, including those for mascaras, have utilized carbon black to provide, inter alia, an intense and deep black color. Regulatory groups have, however, questioned the health and environmental impact of carbon black. For instance, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has listed carbon black (airborne, unbound particles of respirable size) as a substance known to cause cancer. Therefore, the need exists for an alternative and/or replacement for carbon black that can provide the color intensity that is desired by consumers. To increase the color intensity of cosmetic formulations, particularly for mascaras, several approaches have been taken. For instance, using a base for layering with the color formulation may increase color intensity. On the other hand, specialty silicones may be added to the color formulations to bring forth more vibrant and richer colors. Another approach is to incorporate into the color formulation an esterification product between a C12-C14 fatty alcohol and a dimer or trimer of C14-C24 fatty acid having 2 to 4 unsaturation as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication US 2007/0077217. Nevertheless, further improvement in color intensity can be achieved. Additional approaches to enhance color intensity of cosmetic formulation include the use of different types of pigments. However, no pigment has been found to be capable of matching the color intensity of carbon black. As such, it has been surprisingly and unexpectedly discovered that cosmetic compositions comprising at least one colorant, at least one anionic polymer and at least one starch provide increased color intensity for a variety of cosmetic products including, for example, mascaras and eyeliners. It has also been discovered that the cosmetic compositions are able to provide an alternative and/or replacement for carbon black that provides the color intensity of carbon black, as well as additional colors. It has even further been discovered that the cosmetic compositions according to the present invention can be used to provide mascara and further consumer products with increased color intensity.

Anionic Polymer The cosmetic composition for increasing color intensity comprises at least one anionic polymer. In accordance with the present invention, suitable anionic polymers include, for example: ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers. The anionic polymer can provide hydrogen bond formation with colorants that assist in the dispersion of the color pigments. For instance, a useful hydrogen bond forming anionic copolymer is ethylene/acrylic acid copolymer (EAA). The EAA copolymer has the combined structural features of an ethylene group (E), which is non-polar, water resistant and flexible, and an acrylic acid group (AA), which is polar and capable of crosslinking. As a whole, the EAA copolymer, offers stable separation through electrostatic repulsion of the negatively-charged carboxylate and while allowing interaction with other EAA copolymer molecules and the color pigments. As a result, color pigments are effectively dispersed. As a component in the cosmetic composition for increasing color intensity, the at least one anionic polymer exists in a range. In one embodiment, the at least one anionic polymer is present in the composition in the range of about 1% to about 12% by weight, wherein the weight percentages are based on the total weight of the composition.

One particularly preferred starch according to the present invention is hydrolyzed corn starch. In general, the at least one starch may serve various purposes, such as being surfactants, emulsifiers and thickening agents. The starch may work in conjunction with the anionic polymer to form hydrogen bonds and thereby further provide optimal pigment dispersion and optimal viscosity. As a component in the cosmetic composition for increasing color intensity, the at least one starch exists in a range. In one embodiment, the at least one starch is present in the composition in the range of about 0.5% to about 5% by weight, wherein the weight percentages are based on the total weight of the composition.

Particularly preferred mattifying agents include beeswax and copernicia cerifera (carbauba) wax. As a component in the cosmetic composition for increasing color intensity, the at least one mattifying agent exists in a range. In one embodiment, the at least one mattifying agent is present in the composition in the range of about 1% to about 35% by weight, wherein the weight percentages are based on the total weight of the composition. In another embodiment, the at least one mattifying agent is present in the composition in the range of about 1% to about 25% by weight, wherein the weight percentages are based on the total weight of the composition. Auxiliary Ingredient(s) The cosmetic composition for increasing color intensity optionally comprises at least one auxiliary ingredient. In accordance with the present invention, suitable auxiliary ingredients include, for example: film formers, methicones, solvents, alcohols, preservatives, emulsifiers, thickeners, thinning agents, stabilizers, fragrances, extracts, binders, vitamins, silicones, plasticizers, and mixtures thereof. Further additional auxiliary ingredients would be readily recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art. As a component in the cosmetic composition for increasing color intensity, the at least one auxiliary ingredient exists in a range. In one embodiment, the at least one auxiliary ingredient is present in the composition in the range of about 48% to about 91.5% by weight, wherein the weight percentages are based on the total weight of the composition. In another embodiment, the at least one auxiliary ingredient is present in the composition in the range of about 25% to about 75% by weight, wherein the weight percentages are based on the total weight of the composition. The viscosity of the cosmetic composition for increasing color intensity can be controlled by using the combination of components described herein. The viscosity can be controlled by varying the amount of one component in the composition with respect to the other components. For example, if the at least one mattifying agent is a wax, then by lowering the amount of the at least one mattifying agent that is a wax in the composition, the viscosity of the overall composition would increase. The composition preferably has a viscosity in the range of 10 to 85 UD. More preferably, the composition has a viscosity in the range of 25 to 60 UD.
