Field of the invention The present invention relates to liquid and powdered compositions as well as emulsions comprising whey protein and lipid, particularly fish oil, suitable for enrichment of a variety of food articles and beverages with for instance polyunsaturated fatty acids like omega-3 fatty acids. The composition may also be consumed as such. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a process of preparing such compositions and emulsions. In the following, the terms "emulsion(s)" and "powder(s)" will sometimes be used. However, these terms should herein be considered as encompassing the term "liquid and powdered composition(s)". Furthermore, the term "composition(s)" used herein alone, should be considered as encompassing the term "liquid and powdered compositions as well as emulsions". The term "lipid" or "lipid component" as used herein encompasses oils, fats, fatty acids or derivatives of fatty acids like esters and triglycerides. Background of the invention The consumption of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), mainly through food or beverage compositions is beneficial for diverse health concerns. The strong scientific evidence on the health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids is supported by more than 6.000 published studies. They suggest that diets rich in omega-3 very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA and DHA) help maintaining the performance of the heart and the cardiovascular system by reducing the levels of triglycerides (fats) in the blood, by supporting the blood pressure regulation and maintaining a regular heartbeat. In addition, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have demonstrated their beneficial effects on the maintenance of healthy bones and joints particularly due to prevention of inflammation. Mounting evidence also suggests that omega-3 PUFAs have positive effects on schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's disease, neurodevelopmental and other psychic disorders. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids also play an important role during pregnancy and in infant development. Omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs are considered essential to health, and are thus when used as ingredients of functional foods, providing a multitude of benefits unmatched by other food ingredient. Nutrition in the Western Hemisphere is by some scientists considered to have an imbalance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, with too high proportion of omega-6 fatty acids. It is therefore recommended by many to increase the intake of omega-3 fatty acids. Food fortification with PUFAs, and in particular long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, is therefore highly desirable. However, despite large efforts made from the oil and food industries, it is still a challenge to prepare palatable food and beverage products due to oxidative deterioration of the omega-3 fatty acids and the sources thereof leading to off-flavour formation and poor storage stability. A good initial quality with a clean sensory profile of the source of PUFAs is a key aspect in this kind of food fortification. The most common sources of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids are fish oils (DHA and EPA) from various sources including salmon, cod, menhaden and tuna eye socket, as well as algae sources (DHA). Other marine and plant oils and fats are sources of PUFAs as well. Lipid oxidation rendering to rancidity is a problem connected to fish oil and fish fat-rich products during storage and processing. Unpleasant side effects of ingesting fish oil supplements like halitosis, eructation and "fishy" smelling breath, skin and even urine have been reported. Objectionable fishy off-flavours due to volatile fish oil oxidation products is thus an obstacle in the development of fish oil enriched foods and beverages. It is a major challenge for the food industry to overcome the undesirable side effects typically associated with the use of PUFA ingredients, such as strong fishy flavours and aromas. Moreover, whey protein has well documented nutritional advantages. Whey has the highest biological value of all proteins, it contains all essential amino acids, which are vital for human metabolism, and to make human body function properly for good health. Whey also boasts the highest concentrations of branched chain amino acids (BCAA's) found in nature. BCAA's are an important source of energy during exercise and play a key role in protein synthesis. This makes whey the most popular protein for athletes and sport people. Encapsulation of the fish oil is one of the most promising methods to prevent oxidation and therefore, rancidity of foods containing fish oil. Furthermore, the high degree of susceptibility of such omega-3 oils makes a case for microencapsulation in a matrix that makes them suitable for food applications. For instance as disclosed in International patent application WO 9401001, which relates to microencapsulation of an oil or fat having a content of at least 10 % highly unsaturated fatty acid by homogenising a mixture of the oil and an aqueous solution of a caseinate at a pressure above 200 bar. The resulting emulsion is then dried by using methods known per se to obtain free flowing microcapsules. Besides stabilising these omega-3 oils, microencapsulation provides compositions that may be favourable to include in various food products also for other reasons such as convenience of addition; product compatibility; protection from secondary thermal processes like baking and extrusion; prevention of ingredient interactions (as, for example, DHA interacts negatively with certain artificial colours and flavours); and, above all, to extend shelf life of the fortified food. Among the numerous processes known for producing microencapsulated oil, proteins from plant, egg or milk, including whey, are involved as microencapsulating agents. US patent application having publication no. 2004/0062846, relates to creamer compositions and methods of making and using the same. These compositions comprise a primary (microparticulated) and a secondary ingredient component. The primary microparticulated ingredient component comprises 0.1-80% of a fat/oil component, and 0.1-70% of a microparticulated protein component. The secondary ingredient comprises an emulsifier and a bulking agent. The protein sources mentioned are plant proteins, dairy proteins, animal proteins and mixtures thereof. The process of preparing the creamer composition requires heating of the oil/fat until liquefaction, then addition of water and agitation, and furthermore addition of protein which is already microparticulated and then a two step homogenization firstly at 30 to 100 bar, and secondly at 100 to 300 bar. The obtained composition should be subjected to one or more sterilization processes to render microbiological stability. This process is rather cumbersome and expensive due to the large number of different steps and many essential ingredients. In International patent application WO 03/090560, compositions of protein and fatty acid useful as food or beverage compositions are disclosed. The compositions are prepared by combining the protein component with the lipid component to form a protein/lipid mixture, and subjecting this mixture to a condition selected from the group consisting of: (a) high shear conditions, (b) homogenization, and combinations thereof. Microparticulation is not mentioned. In the said process addition of emulsifiers and minerals are preferred in order to avoid rupture of the oil vesicles during homogenization. It is now surprisingly found that by microparticulating a whey protein component and a lipid component simultaneously, a composition of high concentration of fatty acid material, which is stable, pasteurized, organoleptically appealing with long shelf life and thereby useful for a variety of purposes, especially as ingredient to foods and beverages, is obtained. The said composition is capable of being subjected to UHT (ultra high temperature) treatment if necessary. Moreover, the composition obtained has a high content of whey protein which is very desirable for athletes and sports people. Summary of the invention It is a main object of the present invention to provide a simple method for producing a composition of lipid and protein wherein different kinds of additional additives like carbohydrates, emulsifiers, bulking agents, antioxidants, etc. are not required.

The lipid component employed in the composition of the present invention includes any edible oil or fat. The oils or fats may comprise saturated, partially saturated, unsaturated fatty acids and/or derivatives thereof and/or mixtures thereof. Preferably the oils or fats comprise a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids or derivatives thereof. Such edible oils and fats are derived from plant, animal, marine or microorganism sources. Plant sources include soybean oil, canola oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, sesame seed oil, olive oil, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and palm oil.

Preferably, the amount of lipid in the composition is from about 1 % to 30 %, more preferable 10 % to 25 %, and even more preferable, from 12 to 25% by weight of the composition when present in liquid form or powdered form thereof. The ratio of protein to fat in the composition of the present invention ranges from 0.3 to 30.0, more preferable 0.3 to 10.0, and most preferable from 0.3 to 4.0. The median particle size in the composition according to the invention is about 1 µm, and the median particle size distribution ranges from 0.1 µm to 50 µm more preferable from 0.4 µm to 10 µm. The compositions of the present invention have the particularity of comprising only a protein and lipid component as essential components. No addition of further ingredients/materials like emulsifiers, carbohydrates, salts, bulking agents, minerals, flavouring agents etc. is necessary to enhance stability or organleptic properties of the emulsion or powder. In the case of antioxidants, the only ones used are those to preserve the oil before it is used in the emulsion or the powder. After the emulsion is manufactured, no addition of antioxidants is necessary. Preferred antioxidants are natural and synthesized antioxidants for use in foodstuffs and derivatives thereof, such as butylhydroxyanisol (BHA), 2,6-di-tert-butylhydroxytoluene(BHT), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), propylgallate (PG), gallic acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), vitamin K, tocopherol and tocotrienols (vitamin E), citric acids, terpenoids (carotenes, astaxanthin, canthaxantin) and different antioxidants of vegetable origin (spice, plants, berries, fruits) as for example rosmary, green tea, garlic, flavonols, flavonoides, and phenolic acids. The main feature of the process of the present invention, is that the microencapsulation of the oil is made simultaneously with the microparticulation of the protein. The process comprises preparing a composition as defined above, wherein the protein and lipid components firstly are mixed according to a food processing method known in the art, to make a homogenous mixture. The said mixture is then subjected to microparticulation of the protein component which also result in microencapsulation of the lipid by bringing the said mixture, that is heated to 60-70°C under mild agitation, to a shear rate of >400 s-1 in one or more scraped surface heat exchanger(s) (SSHE) constituting a heating section wherein the temperature is from 72-110°C, and after a holding time of 1-10 min. at this temperature, bringing the mixture further on to a shear rate of >400 s-1 in further one or more SSHE(s) constituting a cooling section to obtain the composition having a temperature below the denaturation temperature of whey when leaving cooling section. Further cooling of the composition obtained to about 4°C may be performed if desired. In another embodiment of the invention the composition obtained may immediately be subjected to ultra high temperature (UHT) treatment. The temperature in the heating section is preferably from 80-105°C, more preferable from 85-105°C, and most preferable from 90-105°C. The shear rate in the SSHEs is preferably above 600 s-1, and more preferred from 600-800 s-1 .The shear rate in the SSHEs is preferably not higher than 1000 s-1. The holding time of the mixture between the heating section and the cooling section is a time long enough to reach a denaturation rate of the individual whey proteins from 50 % to 99 %; i.e. 1-10 minutes. The temperature of the composition when leaving the cooling section is preferably below 75°C, more preferred below 50°C. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the mixture pre-treated according to a previously known food processing method is subjected to simultaneous microparticulation of the protein component and microencapsulation of the lipid, by: i) -heating to 60-70°C and subjecting to mild stirring;ii) -transferring to a first SSHE wherein the temperature is 72-100°C and the shear rate is above 600 s-1, and after maintenance of this temperature and share rate for 1-5 min.;iii) -transferring to a second SSHE wherein the shear rate is equal to the shear rate in the first SSHE to cooling the composition obtained to below 75°C. The present invention provides a unique process for achieving a pasteurized composition with denaturation rate of the individual whey proteins from 50 % to 99 %. Further pasteurization will not be necessary to perform for the obtained compositions. In order to increase the storage stability of the composition, UHT treatment may easily be performed without any functional changes in the composition. In addition, the achievement of the high protein denaturation rate in presence of oil produces remarkable microencapsulation properties that enable a stable composition, capable of resisting further pH adjustments without the need of additional emulsifiers. The pH in the mixtures that are subjected to simultaneously microparticulation and microencapsulation according to the present invention may vary, which will results in compositions with different pH. The compositions of the invention are organoleptically outstanding wherein the median particle size distribution ranges from 0.1 µm to 50 µm, more preferable 0.4 µm to 10 µm. The composition in liquid/emulsion form may be de-watered by spray drying, freeze drying or fluid bed drying to form a powder without need for addition of any bulking and/or drying agents. The simultaneous process of the invention produces an emulsion or powder that does not require addition of any additional ingredient components. Whey and lipid are the only required ingredients. The emulsion or powder can be use to enrich with for instance Omega 3 oil any kind of food products or beverages. Healthy functional foods, dietetic foods and pharmaceuticals where a high content of oil containing polyunsaturated fatty acids is desired, are also obtainable by addition of the compositions of the present invention. The composition of the present invention may as well be consumed as such in form of an emulsion, drink or powder. In addition to the health benefits of the lipid, the whey protein matrix of the invention is in itself a natural nutrient which does not contain any additives and protects the oil against oxidative degradation. The high content of whey protein provided in the compositions of the invention makes the compositions relevant as protein supplements for athletes and sport people. A composition comprising a high amount of omega-3 PUFA having superior properties in terms of taste and stability, is provided by the present invention. The invention is explained in more detail in the examples below. Example 1 To demonstrate the superior properties of a composition of the present invention, several analyses were performed of a sample of a composition prepared according to the process of the present invention. Similar analyses of compositions prepared according to methods known from the prior art were performed as well for the purpose of comparison. Preparation of a composition of the present invention Emulsion A mixture of non-denatured whey protein having a whey protein concentration of 60 % in total solids (WPC 60) and 2 % sodium caseinate of the composition, in a protein concentration of 20 % in the water phase of the composition, and 20 % fish oil was prepared according to a conventional food processing method. The mixture was then transferred to a SSHE and subjected to a shear rate > 600 s-1 and a temperature from 85-95°C for 1-5 min. After further treatment at the same shear rate and a temperature of < 75°C in a second SSHE, an emulsion was obtained. Powder The emulsion prepared above, was dried by conventional spray drying. Preparation of comparison compositions A1 and A2 A mixture of non-denatured whey protein having a whey protein concentration of 60 % of total solids (WPC 60) and 2 % sodium caseinate of the composition, in a protein concentration of 20 % in the water phase of the composition, and 20 % fish oil was prepared according to a conventional food processing method and subjected to homogenisation at two different conditions to form two different emulsions, A1, A2. A1: The homogenisation was performed once at 150 bar.A2: The homogenisation was performed three times at 150 bar. A third emulsion (A3) processed by homogenisation at 500 bar was not possible to obtain, as the viscosity of the emulsion was too high for this kind of equipment. By conventional spray drying, emulsions A1 and A2 were formed to powders. Due to high viscosity of the emulsions, large amounts of water had to be added to the composition to enable spray drying. Preparation of comparison compositions B1, B2 and B3 Non-denatured whey protein having a whey protein concentration of 60 % of total solids (WPC 60) and 2 % sodium caseinate of the composition, in a protein concentration of 20 % in the water phase of the composition was subjected to a conventional food processing method. This aqueous mixture was microparticulated according to a previously known technique. 20 % fish oil was added to the microparticulated proteins, and this mixture was then homogenized under three different conditions to obtain three different emulsions, B1, B2, B3. B1: The homogenisation was performed once at 150 bar.B2: The homogenisation was performed three times at 150 bar.B3: The homogenisation was performed once at 500 bar. Production of B3 was only possible after addition of large amount of water to the composition, and after heating of the composition to approx. 60-70°C prior to processing. Without this pre-treatment, the viscosity of the composition increased too much to be processed by this method. By conventional spray drying, emulsions B1, B2 and B3 were formed to powders. Similar to compositions A1 and A2, the viscosity of the emulsions B1-B3 were high, and large amounts of water had to be added to enable spray drying. Analyses The emulsions and powders performed were tested with regard to storage stability with regard to oxidation stability and physical properties, such as: taste, particle size distribution, rheological parameters, turbiscan and centrifugation stability, protein/fat ratio, degree of protein denaturation and solubility. The emulsion and powder according to the invention showed better results in all the tests performed compared to emulsions A1, A2, B1, B2 and B3, and the powders thereof. The emulsion according to the invention had a remarkably low viscosity, high physical stability, and good smell and taste without unwanted fishy off-favour. It was furthermore found that the emulsion had a very high physical stablity, low viscosity and a good and acceptable taste during a long storage period of more than 4 months. Due to the low viscosity of the emulsion of the invention, the spray drying process could be done by use of a more concentrated solution than what was the case for the emulsions of the comparative examples. This resulted in a much better production economy for the powder of the invention. The powder according to the invention had a good and acceptable taste (i.e. no fishy off-flavour) and good storage stability for more than 4 months.
