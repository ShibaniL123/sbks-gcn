The terms "proximal" and "distal" are used herein with reference to a clinician manipulating the handle portion of the surgical instrument. The term "proximal" referring to the portion closest to the clinician and the term "distal" referring to the portion located away from the clinician. It will be further appreciated that, for convenience and clarity, spatial terms such as "vertical," "horizontal," "up," and "down" may be used herein with respect to the drawings. However, surgical instruments are used in many orientations and positions, and these terms are not intended to be limiting and/or absolute. Various exemplary devices and methods are provided for performing laparoscopic and minimally invasive surgical procedures. However, the person of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the various methods and devices disclosed herein can be used in numerous surgical procedures and applications including, for example, in connection with open surgical procedures. As the present Detailed Description proceeds, those of ordinary skill in the art will further appreciate that the various instruments disclosed herein can be inserted into a body in any way, such as through a natural orifice, through an incision or puncture hole formed in tissue, etc. The working portions or end effector portions of the instruments can be inserted directly into a patient's body or can be inserted through an access device that has a working channel through which the end effector and elongated shaft of a surgical instrument can be advanced. FIG. 1 generally depicts a motor-driven surgical instrument 2200. In certain circumstances, the surgical instrument 2200 may include a handle assembly 2202, a shaft assembly 2204, and a power assembly 2206 (or "power source" or "power pack"). The shaft assembly 2204 may include an end effector 2208 which, in certain circumstances, can be configured to act as an endocutter for clamping, severing, and/or stapling tissue, although, in other circumstances, different types of end effectors may be used, such as end effectors for other types of surgical devices, graspers, cutters, staplers, clip appliers, access devices, drug/gene therapy devices, ultrasound, RF and/or laser devices, etc. Several RF devices may be found in U.S. Patent No. 5,403,312, entitled ELECTROSURGICAL HEMOSTATIC DEVICE, which issued on April 4, 1995, and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 12/031,573, entitled SURGICAL FASTENING AND CUTTING INSTRUMENT HAVING RF ELECTRODES, filed February 14, 2008. The entire disclosures of U.S. Patent No. 5,403,312, entitled ELECTROSURGICAL HEMOSTATIC DEVICE, which issued on April 4,1995, and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 12/031,573, entitled SURGICAL FASTENING AND CUTTING INSTRUMENT HAVING RF ELECTRODES, filed February 14, 2008, are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Referring again to FIG. 1, the handle assembly 2202 may comprise a housing 2210 that includes a handle 2212 that may be configured to be grasped, manipulated, and/or actuated by a clinician. However, it will be understood that the various unique and novel arrangements of the housing 2210 may also be effectively employed in connection with robotically-controlled surgical systems. Thus, the term "housing" may also encompass a housing or similar portion of a robotic system that houses or otherwise operably supports at least one drive system that is configured to generate and apply at least one control motion which could be used to actuate the shaft assembly 2204 disclosed herein and its respective equivalents. For example, the housing 2210 disclosed herein may be employed with various robotic systems, instruments, components, and methods disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 13/118,241, entitled SURGICAL STAPLING INSTRUMENTS WITH ROTATABLE STAPLE DEPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS, now U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0298719. The disclosure of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 13/118,241, entitled SURGICAL STAPLING INSTRUMENTS WITH ROTATABLE STAPLE DEPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS, now U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0298719, is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In certain instances, the surgical instrument 2200 may include several operable systems that extend, at least partially, through the shaft 2204 and are in operable engagement with the end effector 2208. For example, the surgical instrument 2200 includes a closure assembly that transitions the end effector 2208 between an open configuration and a closed configuration, an articulation assembly that articulates the end effector 2208 relative to the shaft 2204, and/or a firing assembly that fastens and/or cut tissue captured by the end effector 2208. In addition, the housing 2210 may be separably couplable to the shaft 2204 and may include complimenting closure, articulation, and/or firing drive systems for operating the closure, articulation, and firing assemblies, respectively. In use, an operator of the surgical instrument 2200 may desire to reset the surgical instrument 2200 and return one or more of the assemblies of the surgical instrument 2200 to a default position. For example, the operator may insert the end effector 2208 into a surgical site within a patient through an access port and may then articulate and/or close the end effector 2208 to capture tissue within the cavity. The operator may then choose to undo some or all of the previous actions and may choose to remove the surgical instrument 2200 from the cavity, for instance. The surgical instrument 2200 includes one more systems configured to facilitate a reliable return of one or more of the assemblies described above to a home state with minimal input from the operator thereby allowing the operator to remove the surgical instrument from the cavity. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 3, the surgical instrument 2200 includes a control system 3000. A surgical operator may utilize the control system 3000 to articulate the end effector 2208 relative to the shaft 2204 between an articulation home state position and an articulated position. The surgical operator may utilize the control system 3000 to reset or return the articulated end effector 2208 to the articulation home state position. The control system 3000 is positioned, at least partially, in the housing 2210. As illustrated in in FIG. 3, the control system 3000 comprises a microcontroller 3002 ("controller") which is configured to receive an input signal and, in response, activate a motor 2216 to cause the end effector 2208 to articulate in accordance with such an input signal. The end effector 2208 is positioned in sufficient alignment with the shaft 2204 in the articulation home state position, also referred to herein as an unarticulated position such that the end effector 2208 and at least a portion of shaft 2204 can be inserted into or retracted from a patient's internal cavity through an access port such as a trocar positioned in a wall of the internal cavity without damaging the access port. The end effector 2208 is aligned, or at least substantially aligned, with a longitudinal axis "LL" passing through the shaft 2204 when the end effector 2208 is in the articulation home state position, as illustrated in FIG. 1 The articulation home state position can be at any angle up to and including 5° with the longitudinal axis "LL" on either side of the longitudinal axis "LL". In other cases, the articulation home state position can be at any angle up to and including 3° with the longitudinal axis "LL" on either side of the longitudinal axis "LL". In yet another instance, the articulation home state position can be at any angle up to and including 7° with the longitudinal axis "LL" on either side of the longitudinal axis "LL". The control system 3000 is operated to articulate the end effector 2208 relative to the shaft 2204 in a plane extending along the longitudinal axis "LL" in a first direction such as a clockwise direction and/or a second direction such as a counterclockwise direction. The control system 3000 can be operated to articulate the end effector 2208 in the clockwise direction form the articulation home state position to an articulated position 10 degrees to the right of the longitudinal axis "LL". In another example, the control system 3000 can be operated to articulate the end effector 2208 in the counterclockwise direction form the articulated position at 10 degrees to the right of the longitudinal axis "LL" to the articulation home state position. In yet another example, the control system 3000 can be operated to articulate the end effector 2208 relative to the shaft 2204 in the counterclockwise direction from the articulation home state position to an articulated position 10 degrees to the left of the longitudinal axis "LL". The reader will appreciate that the end effector can be articulated to different angles in the clockwise direction and/or the counterclockwise direction. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the housing 2210 of the surgical instrument 2200 comprises an interface 3001 which includes a plurality of controls that can be utilized by the operator to operate the surgical instrument 2200. The interface 3001 comprises a plurality of switches which are coupled to the controller 3002 via electrical circuits. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the interface 3001 comprises three switches 3004A-C, wherein each of the switches 3004A-C is coupled to the controller 3002 via electrical circuits such as, for example electrical circuits 3006A-C, respectively. The reader will appreciate that other combinations of switches and circuits can be utilized with the interface 3001. Referring to FIG. 3, the controller 3002 generally comprises a microprocessor 3008 ("processor") and one or more memory units 3010 operationally coupled to the processor 3008. By executing instruction code stored in the memory 3010, the processor 3008 controls various components of the surgical instrument 2200, such as the motor 2216, various drive systems, and/or a user display. The controller 3002 may be implemented using integrated and/or discrete hardware elements, software elements, and/or a combination of both. Examples of integrated hardware elements may include processors, microprocessors, microcontrollers, integrated circuits, application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), programmable logic devices (PLD), digital signal processors (DSP), field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), logic gates, registers, semiconductor devices, chips, microchips, chip sets, microcontrollers, system-on-chip (SoC), and/or system-in-package (SIP). Examples of discrete hardware elements may include circuits and/or circuit elements such as logic gates, field effect transistors, bipolar transistors, resistors, capacitors, inductors, and/or relays. The controller 3002 may include a hybrid circuit comprising discrete and integrated circuit elements or components on one or more substrates. The microcontroller 3002 may be an LM 4F230H5QR, available from Texas Instruments. The Texas Instruments LM4F230H5QR is an ARM Cortex-M4F Processor Core comprising on-chip memory of 256 KB single-cycle flash memory, or other non-volatile memory, up to 40 MHz, a prefetch buffer to improve performance above 40 MHz, a 32 KB single-cycle serial random access memory (SRAM), internal read-only memory (ROM) loaded with StellarisWare® software, 2KB electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), one or more pulse width modulation (PWM) modules, one or more quadrature encoder inputs (QEI) analog, one or more 12-bit Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) with 12 analog input channels, among other features that are readily available. Other microcontrollers may be readily substituted for use with the present disclosure. Accordingly, the present disclosure should not be limited in this context. The motor 2216 may be a DC brushed driving motor having a maximum rotation of, approximately, 25,000 RPM. Alternatively, the motor 2216 may include a brushless motor, a cordless motor, a synchronous motor, a stepper motor, or any other suitable electric motor. A battery 2218 (or "power source" or "power pack"), such as a Li ion battery may be coupled to the housing 2212 to supply power to the motor 2216. Referring again to FIG. 3, the surgical instrument 2200 includes a motor controller 3005 in operable communication with the controller 3002. The motor controller 3005 is configured to control a direction of rotation of the motor 2216. The motor controller 3005 is configured to determine the voltage polarity applied to the motor 2216 by the battery 2218 and, in turn, determine the direction of rotation of the motor 2216 based on input from the controller 3002. For example, the motor 2216 reverses the direction of its rotation from a clockwise direction to a counterclockwise direction when the voltage polarity applied to the motor 2216 by the battery 2218 is reversed by the motor controller 3005 based on input from the controller 3002. In addition, the motor 2216 is operably coupled to an articulation drive which can be driven by the motor 2216 distally or proximally depending on the direction in which the motor 2216 rotates. Furthermore, the articulation drive is operably coupled to the end effector 2208 such that the axial translation of the articulation drive proximally causes the end effector 2208 to be articulated in the counterclockwise direction and/or the axial translation of the articulation drive distally causes the end effector 2208 to be articulated in the clockwise direction. Referring to FIGS. 1-3, the interface 3001 is configured such that the switch 3004A is dedicated to the clockwise articulation of the end effector 2208 and the switch 3004B is dedicated to the counterclockwise articulation of the end effector 2208. In such instances, the operator may articulate the end effector 2208 in the clockwise direction by closing the switch 3004A and may articulate the end effector 2208 in the counterclockwise direction by closing the switch 3004B. The switches 3004A-C comprise open-biased dome switches, as illustrated in FIG. 7. Other types of switches can also be employed such as capacitive switches. Referring to FIG. 7, the dome switches 3004A and 3004B are controlled by a rocker 3012. Other means for controlling the switches 3004A and 3004B are contemplated by the present disclosure. In the neutral position, as illustrated in FIG. 7, both of the switches 3004A and 3004B are biased in the open position. The operator may articulate the end effector 2208 in the clockwise direction by tilting the rocker forward thereby depressing the dome switch 3004A, as illustrated in FIG. 8. In result, the circuit 3006A (FIG. 3) may be closed signaling the controller 3002 to activate the motor 2216 to articulate the end effector 2208 in the clockwise direction, as described above. The motor 2216 continues to articulate the end effector 2208 until the operator releases the rocker 3012 thereby allowing the dome switch 3004A to return to the open position and the rocker 3012 to the neutral position. In some circumstances, the controller 3002 is able to identify when the end effector 2208 has reached a predetermined maximum degree of articulation and, at such point, interrupt power to the motor 2216 regardless of whether the dome switch 3004A is being depressed. In a way, the controller 3002 can be configured to override the operator's input and stop the motor 2216 when a maximum degree of safe articulation is reached. Alternatively, the operator may articulate the end effector 2208 in the counterclockwise direction by tilting the rocker 3012 back thereby depressing the dome switch 3004B. In result, the circuit 3006B is closed signaling the controller 3002 to activate the motor 2216 to articulate the end effector 2208 in the counterclockwise direction, as described above. The motor 2216 continues to articulate the end effector 2208 until the operator releases the rocker 3012 thereby allowing the dome switch 3004B to return to the open position and the rocker 3012 to the neutral position. he controller 3002 may be able to identify when the end effector 2208 has reached a predetermined maximum degree of articulation and, at such point, interrupt power to the motor 2216 regardless of whether the dome switch 3004B is being depressed. In a way, the controller 3002 can be configured to override the operator's input and stop the motor 2216 when a maximum degree of safe articulation is reached. As described above in greater detail, an operator may desire to return the end effector 2208 to the articulation home state position to align, or at least substantially align, the end effector 2208 with the shaft 2204 in order to retract the surgical instrument 2200 from a patient's internal cavity. The control system 3000 includes a virtual detent that may alert the operator when the end effector 2208 has reached the articulation home state position. The control system 3000 is configured to stop the articulation of the end effector 2208 upon reaching the articulation home state position. The control system 3000 is configured to provide feedback to the operator when the end effector 2208 reaches the articulation home state position. The control system 3000 comprises various executable modules such as software, programs, data, drivers, and/or application program interfaces (APIs). FIG. 4 depicts an exemplary virtual detent module 10000 that can be stored in the memory 3010. The module 10000 includes program instructions, which when executed may cause the processer 3008 to alert the operator of the surgical instrument 2200 when the end effector 2208 reaches the articulation home state position during the articulation of the end effector 2208 from an articulated position. As described above, referring primarily to FIGS. 3, 7, and 8, the operator may use the rocker 3012 to articulate the end effector 2208. The operator may depress the dome switch 3004A of the rocker 3012 to articulate the end effector 2208 in a first direction such as a clockwise direction to the right and may depress the dome switch 3004B to articulate the end effector 2208 in a second direction such as a counterclockwise direction to the left. As illustrated in FIG. 4, the module 10000 modulates the response of the processor 3008 to input signals from the dome switches 3004A and/or 3004B. For example, the processor 3008 is configured to activate the motor 2216 to articulate the end effector 2208 to the right while the dome switch 3004A is depressed; and the processor 3008 can be configured to activate the motor 2216 to articulate the end effector 2208 to the left while the dome switch 3004B is depressed. In addition, the processor 3008 is configured to stop the articulation of the end effector 2208 by causing the motor 2216 to stop when input signals from the dome switches 3004A and/or 3004B are stopped such as when the operator releases the dome switches 3004A and/or 3004B, respectively. As described above, the articulation home state position comprises a range of positions. The processor 3008 is configured to detect when the end effector 2208 enters the range of positions defining the articulation home state position. The surgical instrument 2200 comprises one or more positioning systems (not shown) for sensing and recording the articulation position of the end effector 2208. The processor 3008 is configured to employ the one or more positioning systems to detect when the end effector 2208 enters the articulation home state position. As illustrated in FIG. 4, upon reaching the articulation home state position, the processor 3008 stops the articulation of the end effector 2208 to alert the operator that the articulation home state position is reached; the processor 3008 may stop the articulation in the articulation home state position even if the operator continues to depress the rocker 3012. In certain instances, in order to continue past the articulation home state position, the operator may release the rocker 3012 and then tilt it again to restart the articulation. For example, the operator may push the rocker 3012 to depress dome switch 3004A to rotate the end effector 2208 toward its home state position until the end effector 2208 reaches its home state position and the processor 3008 stops the articulation of the end effector 2208, wherein the operator can then release the rocker 3012 and, then, push the rocker 3012 to depress the dome switch 3004A once again in order to continue the articulation of the end effector 2208 in the same direction. As illustrated in FIG. 5, the module 10000 comprises a feedback mechanism to alert the operator when the articulation home state position is reached. Various feedback devices 2248 (FIG. 3) can be employed by the processor 3008 to provide sensory feedback to the operator. The devices 2248 may comprise visual feedback devices such as display screens and/or LED indicators. The devices 2248 may comprise audio feedback devices such as speakers and/or buzzers. The devices 2248 may comprise tactile feedback devices such as a mechanical detent which can provide haptic feedback. In some instances, haptic feedback can be provided by a vibrating motor that can provide a pulse of vibrations to the handle of the surgical instrument. The devices 2248 may comprise combinations of visual feedback devices, audio feedback devices, and/or tactile feedback devices. The processor 3008 is configured to stop the articulation of the end effector 2208 and provide feedback to the operator when the articulation home state position is reached. The processor 3008 may provide feedback to the operator but may not stop the articulation of the end effector 2208 when the articulation home state position is reached. The end effector 2208 can be moved from a position on a first side of the home state position toward the home state position, pass through the home state position, and continue moving in the same direction on the other side of the home state position. During such movement, the operator may be supplied with some form of feedback at the moment the end effector 2208 passes through the home state position. The processor 3008 may stop the articulation of the end effector 2208 but may not provide feedback to the operator when the articulation home state position is reached. The processor 3008 may pause the end effector 2208 as it passes through its center position and then continue past its center position. The end effector 2208 can temporarily dwell in its center position for about 2 seconds and then continue its articulation so long as the articulation switch 3012 remains depressed. An operator of the surgical instrument 2200 may attempt to articulate the end effector 2208 back to its unarticulated position utilizing the rocker switch 3012. As the reader will appreciate, the operator may not be able to accurately and/or repeatably align the end effector 2208 with the longitudinal axis of the surgical instrument shaft. In various instances, though, the operator can readily position the end effector 2208 within a certain range of the center position. For instance, an operator may push the rocker switch 3012 to rotate the end effector 2208 toward its center position and then release the rocker switch 3012 when the operator believes that the end effector 2208 has reached its center position or is close to its center position. The processor 3008 interprets such circumstances as an attempt to recenter the end effector 2208 and, in the event that the end effector 2208 is not in its center position, the processor 3008 automatically centers the end effector 2208. In at least one example, if the operator of the surgical instrument releases the rocker switch 3012 when the end effector 2208 is within about 10 degrees on either side of the center position the processor 3008 may automatically recenter the end effector 2208. Referring primarily to FIGS. 3, 6, and 9, the module 10000 comprises an articulation resetting or centering mechanism. The control system 3000 includes a reset input which resets or returns the end effector 2208 to the articulation home state position if the end effector 2208 is in an articulated position. For example, upon receiving a reset input signal, the processor 3008 determines the articulation position of the end effector 2208 and, if the end effector 2208 is in the articulation home state position, the processor 3008 takes no action to change the articulation position of the end effector 2208. However, if the end effector 2208 is in an articulated position when the processor 3008 receives a reset input signal, the processor 3008 activates the motor 2216 to return the end effector 2208 to the articulation home state position. As illustrated in FIG. 9, the operator may depress the rocker 3012 downward to close the dome switches 3004A and 3004B simultaneously, or at least within a short time period from each other, which transmits the reset input signal to the processor 3008 to reset or return the end effector 2208 to the articulation home state position. The operator may then release the rocker 3012 to allow the rocker 3012 to return to the neutral position and the switches 3004A and 3004B to the open positions. Alternatively, the interface 3001 of the control system 3000 may include a separate reset switch such as another dome switch which can be independently closed by the operator to transmit the articulation reset input signal to the processor 3008. Referring again to FIG. 1, the end effector 2208 of the surgical instrument 2200 includes a first jaw comprising an anvil 10002 and a second jaw comprising a channel 10004 configured to receive a staple cartridge 10006 which includes a plurality of staples. The end effector 2208 can be transitioned between an open configuration and a closed configuration to capture tissue between the anvil 10002 and the staple cartridge 10006. Furthermore, the surgical instrument 2200 includes a firing member which can be moved axially between a firing home state position and a fired position to deploy the staples from the staple cartridge 10006 and/or cut the tissue captured between the anvil 10002 and the staple cartridge 10006 when the end effector 2208 is in the closed configuration. As discussed above, the end effector 2208 can be transitioned between an open configuration and a closed configuration to clamp tissue therein. The anvil 10002 can be moved between an open position and a closed position to compress tissue against the staple cartridge 10006. The pressure or force that the anvil 10002 can apply to the tissue may depend on the thickness of the tissue. For a given gap distance between the anvil 10002 and the staple cartridge 10006, the anvil 10002 will apply a larger compressive pressure or force to thicker tissue than thinner tissue. The surgical instrument can include a sensor, such as a load cell which can detect the pressure or force being applied to the tissue. The thickness and/or composition of the tissue may change while pressure or force is being applied thereto. For instance, fluid, such as blood contained within the compressed tissue may flow outwardly into the adjacent tissue. In such circumstances, the tissue may become thinner and/or the compressive pressure or force applied to the tissue may be reduced. The sensor configured to detect the pressure of force being applied to the tissue detects this change. The sensor is in signal communication with the processor 3008 wherein the processor 3008 monitors the pressure or force being applied to the tissue and/or the change in the pressure of force being applied to the tissue. The processor 3008 evaluates the change in the pressure or force and communicates to the operator of the surgical instrument when the pressure or force has reached a steady state condition and is no longer changing. The processor 3008 also determines when the change in the pressure or force is at and/or below a threshold value, or rate. For instance, when the change in the pressure or force is above about 10 percent per second, the processor 3008 illuminates a caution indicator associated with the firing actuator and when the change in the pressure or force is at or below about 10 percent per second, the processor illuminates a ready-to-fire indicator associated with the firing actuator. The surgical instrument may prohibit the firing member from being advanced distally through the end effector 2208 until the change in pressure or force is at and/or below the threshold rate. The operator of the surgical instrument may elect to deploy only some of the staples stored within the end effector 2208. After the firing member has been sufficiently advanced, in such circumstances, the firing member can be retracted. In various other instances, the operator of the surgical instrument may elect to deploy all of the staples stored within the end effector 2208. In either event, the operator of the surgical instrument can depress a firing actuator extending from the handle assembly 2210 to actuate the motor 2216 and advance the firing member distally. The motor 2216 can be actuated once the firing actuator has been sufficiently depressed. In at least one mode of operation, further depression of the firing actuator does not affect the operation of the motor 2216. The motor 2216 is operated in the manner dictated by the processor 3008 until the firing actuator is released. In at least one other mode of operation, the degree or amount in which the firing actuator is depressed affects the manner in which the motor 2216 is operated. For instance, an initial depression of the firing actuator can be detected by the processor 3008 and, in response thereto, the processor 3008 operates the motor 2216 at a first speed, wherein additional depression of the firing actuator is detected by the processor 3008 and, in response thereto, the processor 3008 operates the motor 2216 at a second speed, such as a faster speed. The change in the depression of the firing actuator can be proportional to the change in the motor speed. The change in the depression of the firing actuator can be linearly proportional to the change in the motor speed. The further the firing actuator is pulled, the faster the motor 2216 is operated. In certain embodiments, the amount of pressure or force applied to the firing actuator affects the manner in which the motor 2216 is operated. For instance, an initial pressure or force applied to the firing actuator can be detected by the processor 3008 and, in response thereto, the processor 3008 operates the motor 2216 at a first speed, wherein additional pressure or force applied to the firing actuator can be detected by the processor 3008 and, in response thereto, the processor 3008 operates the motor 2216 at a second speed, such as a faster speed. The change in the pressure or force applied to the firing actuator can be proportional to the change in the motor speed. The change in the pressure or force applied to the firing actuator can be linearly proportional to the change in the motor speed. The disclosure of U.S. Patent No. 7,845,537, entitled SURGICAL INSTRUMENT HAVING RECORDING CAPABILITIES, which issued on December 7, 2010, is incorporated by reference in its entirety. As discussed above, the operator of the surgical instrument may elect to deploy all of the staples stored within the end effector 2208. In such circumstances, the operator may depress the firing actuator and then release the actuator when they believe that all of the staples have been deployed during a firing stroke of the firing member. The surgical instrument can include an indicator which is illuminated by the processor 3008 when the firing stroke has been completed. A suitable indicator can comprise a light emitting diode (LED). The operator may believe that a firing stroke has been fully completed even though it may have only been nearly completed. The surgical instrument can comprise at least one sensor configured to detect the position of the firing member within its firing stroke wherein the sensor can be in signal communication with the processor 3008. In the event that the firing stroke is ended at a nearly completed position, the processor 3008 commands the motor 2216 to finish the firing stroke of the firing member. For instance, if the firing member has completed all but the last 5 mm of the firing stroke the processor 3008 assumes that the operator meant to complete the firing stroke and automatically completes the firing stroke. Referring again to FIG. 1, the interface 3001 of the surgical instrument 2200 includes a home state input 3014. The operator may utilize the home state input to transmit a home state input signal to the processor 3008 to return the surgical instrument 2200 to home state which may include returning the end effector 2208 to the articulation home state position and/or the firing member to the firing home state position. As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 7, the home state input 3014 may include a cap or a cover which is depressed by the operator to close the switch 3004C and transmit the home state input signal through the circuit 3006C to the processor 3008. In certain instances, the home state input 3014 can be configured to return the end effector 2208 to the articulation home state position, and a separate input can be utilized to return the firing member to the firing home state position. In certain instances, the home state input 3014 can be configured to return the firing member to the firing home state position, and a separate input can be utilized to return the end effector 2208 to the articulation home state position such as, for example, the rocker 3012. The processor 3008 is configured to cause the firing member to return to the firing home state position and the end effector 2208 to return to the articulation home state position upon receiving the home state input signal from the home state input 3014. The response of the processor 3008 to the home state input signal depends on whether the surgical instrument 2200 is in a firing mode or an articulation mode; if the processor 3008 determines that the surgical instrument 2200 is in the articulation mode, the processor 3008 causes the end effector 2208 to return to the articulation home state position in response to the home state input signal; and if the processor 3008 determines that the surgical instrument 2200 is in the firing mode, the processor 3008 causes the firing member to return to the firing home state position in response to the home state input signal. The firing member can be advanced axially to fire the staples from the staple cartridge 10006 only when the end effector 2208 is in the closed configuration. In such instances, the surgical instrument 2200 can be in the firing mode only when the end effector 2208 is in the closed configuration. The end effector 2208 can be articulated only when the end effector 2208 is in the open configuration. In such instances, the surgical instrument 2200 can be in the articulation mode only when the end effector 2208 is in the open configuration. Accordingly the processor 3008 is configured to determine whether the surgical instrument 2200 is in the articulation mode or the firing mode by determining whether the end effector 2208 is in the open configuration or the closed configuration. One or more sensors 3016 (FIG. 3) can be employed by the processor 3008 to determine whether the end effector 2208 is in the open configuration or closed configuration. Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 10, the surgical instrument 2200 comprises a screen 2251 which may be included in the handle assembly 2202. The screen 2251 is employed by one or more of the microcontrollers described herein to alert, guide, and/or provide feedback to the operator of the surgical instrument 2200. The screen 2251 produces an output display 2250. In use, the operator may tilt, flip, and/or rotate the handle assembly 2202 and, in response, the microcontroller can change the orientation of the output display 2250 to improve, align, and/or adjust the orientation of the output display 2250 with respect to the view of the operator of the surgical instrument 2200 and/or any suitable frame of reference, such as an inertial, or at least substantially inertial, frame of reference. A fixed frame of reference can be defined, at least in part, by gravity. The downward acceleration of Earth's gravity can be represented by the vector -g in FIG. 10. A processor, such as the processor 3008 is configured to detect the changes in the position of the handle assembly 2202 with respect to the frame of reference and adopt one of a plurality of orientations of the screen 2251 in accordance with the relative position of the screen 2251 with respect to the frame of reference. As illustrated in FIG. 10, the screen 2251 can be disposed on a top surface 10008 of the handle assembly 2202. The surface 10008 extends in a first plane defined by coordinates X1 and Y1 of a first set of Cartesian coordinates representing the handle assembly 2202. The screen 2251 is positioned within the first plane. In some instances, the screen 2251 may be positioned within a plane which extends parallel to the first plane and/or any suitable plane in a fixed relationship relative to the first plane. For the purposes of convenience herein, it will be assumed that the first set of Cartesian coordinates representing the handle assembly are aligned with the screen 2251 and, thus, referred to as a screen set of Cartesian coordinates. The output display 2250 can reside in a second plane defined by coordinates X2 and Y2 of a second, or display, set of Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in FIG. 10, the first plane can be coplanar with the second plane. Moreover, the first, or screen, set of Cartesian coordinates can be aligned with the second, or display, set of Cartesian coordinates, in at least some instances. For example, +X1 can be aligned with or parallel to +X2, +Y1 can be aligned with or parallel to +Y2, and +Z1 can be aligned with or parallel to +Z2. Correspondingly, in such instances, -X1 can be aligned with or parallel to -X2, -Y1 can be aligned with or parallel to -Y2, and -Z1 can be aligned with or parallel to -Z2. As will be described in greater detail below, the second, or display, set of Cartesian coordinates can be realigned with respect to the first, or screen, set of Cartesian coordinates. A certain arrangement of the display Cartesian coordinates can be preferred. For instance, a neutral position of the surgical instrument 2200 can coincide with the +Z1 axis of the screen coordinates being aligned with the +g vector. As will be described in greater detail below, the processor 3008 can tolerate a certain amount of deviation between the screen coordinates at the reference frame without changing the alignment of the display coordinates; however, beyond a certain deviation between the screen coordinates at the reference frame, the processor can change the alignment of the display coordinates relative to the screen coordinates. Referring to FIGS. 11-12D, a module 10010 is configured to change or alter the orientation of the output display 2250 between a plurality of orientations in response to the changes in the position of the handle assembly 2202 which is monitored through input from one or more accelerometers (not shown) that are housed within the handle assembly 2202. As discussed above, and as illustrated in FIG. 12A, the output display 2250 may adopt a first orientation wherein the +X2 and +Y2 vectors of the display set of Cartesian coordinates are aligned, or at least substantially aligned, with the +X1 and +Y1 vectors, respectively, of the screen set of Cartesian coordinates when the surgical instrument is in its neutral position. As illustrated in FIG. 12B, the output display 2250 may adopt a second orientation wherein the +Y2 and +X2 vectors of the display set of Cartesian coordinates are aligned, or at least substantially aligned, with the +Y1 and -X1 vectors, respectively, of the screen set of Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in FIG. 12C, the output display 2250 may adopt a third orientation wherein the +X2 and +Y2 vectors of the display set of Cartesian coordinates are aligned, or at least substantially aligned, with the -X1 and -Y1 vectors, respectively, of the screen set of Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in FIG. 12D, the output display 2250 may adopt a fourth orientation wherein the +X2 and +Y2 vectors of the second set of Cartesian coordinates are aligned, or at least substantially aligned, with the -Y1 and +X1 vectors, respectively, of the screen set of Cartesian coordinates. Other orientations are possible. Referring to FIGS. 11-12D, the processor 3008 is configured to toggle the orientation of the output display 2250 between a plurality of orientations including the first orientation, the second orientation, the third orientation, and/or the fourth orientation to accommodate changes in the position of the handle assembly 2202. The module 10010 includes a hysteresis control algorithm to prevent dithering of the orientation while toggling between the first, second, third, and/or fourth orientations. A hysteresis control algorithm produces a lag between an initial detection of an event that would result in a display orientation change and the processor command to change the display orientation. The hysteresis control algorithm ignores events which would result in a potentially transient orientation and optimally wait to reorient the display until a steady state, or sufficiently steady state, condition has been reached. The processor 3008 can be configured to orient the output display 2250 in the first orientation when an angle between the +Z1 vector of the Z1 axis and the -g vector of the gravity axis g is less than or equal to a maximum angle. The processor 3008 can be configured to orient the output display 2250 in the second orientation when an angle between the +X1 vector of the X1 axis and the +g vector of the gravity axis g is less than or equal to a maximum angle. The processor 3008 can be configured to orient the output display 2250 in the third orientation when an angle between the +Y1 vector of the Y1 axis and the +g vector of the gravity g axis is less than or equal to a maximum angle. The processor 3008 can be configured to orient the output display 2250 in the fourth orientation when an angle between the +X1 vector of the X1 axis and the -g vector of the gravity axis g is less than or equal to a maximum angle. The maximum angle can be any angle selected from a range of about 0 degrees to about 10 degrees. The maximum angle can be any angle selected from a range of about 0 degrees to about 5 degrees. The maximum angle can be about 5 degrees. The maximum angles described above are exemplary and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure. Referring to FIGS. 11-12D the processor 3008 can be configured to orient the output display 2250 in the first orientation when the +Z1 vector of the Z1 axis and the -g vector of the gravity axis g are aligned, or at least substantially aligned with each other. The processor 3008 can be configured to orient the output display 2250 in the second orientation when the +X1 vector of the X1 axis and the +g vector of the gravity axis g are aligned, or at least substantially aligned with each other. The processor 3008 can be configured to orient the output display 2250 in the third orientation when the +Y1 vector of the Y1 axis and the +g vector of the gravity g axis are aligned, or at least substantially aligned with each other. The processor 3008 can be configured to orient the output display 2250 in the fourth orientation when the +X1 vector of the X1 axis and the -g vector of the gravity axis g are aligned, or at least substantially aligned with each other. Referring to FIGS. 11-12D the processor 3008 can be configured to rotate the output display 2250 from the first orientation to the second orientation if the handle 2212 is rotated clockwise about the longitudinal axis LL (FIG.1) by an angle selected from a range of about 80 degrees to about 100 degrees. If the handle 2212 is rotated clockwise about the longitudinal axis LL by less than 80 degrees, the processor 3008 may not reorient the output display 2250, in this example. The processor 3008 can be configured to rotate the display 2250 from the first orientation to the fourth orientation if the handle 2212 is rotated counterclockwise about the longitudinal axis LL by an angle selected from a range of about 80 degrees to about 100 degrees. If the handle 2212 is rotated counterclockwise about the longitudinal axis LL by less than 80 degrees, the processor 3008 may not reorient the output display 2250, in this example. As described above, the operator may use the rocker 3012 to articulate the end effector 2208. The operator may move their finger in a first direction to tilt the rocker 3012 to depress the dome switch 3004A to articulate the end effector 2208 in a clockwise direction to the right; and the operator may move their finger in a second direction, opposite the first direction, to depress the dome switch 3004B to articulate the end effector 2208 in a counterclockwise direction to the left. Depending on the position and/or orientation of the rocker 3012 with respect to the interface 3001 and/or the handle assembly 2202 in a first or neutral position of the handle assembly 2202, the first direction can be an upward direction and the second direction can be a downward direction as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 14A. In such instances, the operator of the surgical instrument 2200 may become accustomed to moving their finger up to articulate the end effector 2208 to the right; and the operator may become accustomed to moving their finger down to articulate the end effector 2208 to the left. In certain instances, however, the operator may change the position of the handle assembly 2202 to a second position such as an upside down position as illustrated in FIG. 14B. In such instances, if the operator does not remember to reverse the direction of movement of their finger, the operator may unintentionally articulate the end effector 2208 in an opposite direction to the direction the operator intended. Referring to FIG. 13, the surgical instrument 2200 comprises a module 10012 which allows the operator to maintain the directions of movement to which a surgeon may have become accustomed with respect to the operation of the surgical instrument 2200. As discussed above, the processor 3008 can be configured to toggle between a plurality of configurations in response to changes in the position and/or orientation of the handle assembly 2202. As illustrated in FIG. 13, the processor 3008 can be configured to toggle between a first configuration of the interface 3001 associated with a first position and/or orientation of the handle assembly 2202, and a second configuration of the interface 3001 associated with a second position and/or orientation of the handle assembly 2202. In certain instances, in the first configuration, the processor 3008 can be configured to command an articulation motor to articulate the end effector 2208 to the right when the dome switch 3004A is depressed and the processor 3008 can be configured to command an articulation motor to articulate the end effector 2208 to the left when the dome switch 3004B is depressed. In the second configuration, the processor 3008 can command an articulation motor to articulate the end effector 2208 to the left when the dome switch 3004A is depressed and the processor 3008 can command an articulation motor to articulate the end effector 2208 to the right when the dome switch 3004B is depressed. In various embodiments, a surgical instrument can comprise one motor to articulate the end effector 2208 in both directions while, in other embodiments, the surgical instrument can comprise a first motor configured to articulate the end effector 2208 in a first direction and a second motor configured to articulate the end effector 2208 in a second direction. Referring to FIGS. 13-14B, the processor 3008 can be configured to adopt the first configuration while the handle assembly 2202 is in the first position and/or orientation and adopt the second configuration while the handle assembly 2202 is in the second position and/or orientation. The processor 3008 can be configured to detect the orientation and/or position of the handle assembly 2202 through input from one or more accelerometers (not shown) which can be housed within the handle assembly 2202. Such accelerometers can detect the orientation of the handle assembly 2202 with respect to gravity, i.e., up and/or down. The processor 3008 can be configured to adopt the first configuration while an angle between a vector D (FIG. 1) extending through the handle assembly 2202 and the gravity vector g is any angle in the range of about 0 degrees to about 100 degrees. The processor 3008 can be configured to adopt the first configuration while the angle between the vector D and the gravity vector g is any angle in the range of about 0 degrees to about 90 degrees. The processor 3008 can be configured to adopt the first configuration while the angle between the vector D and the gravity vector g is less than or equal to about 80 degrees. The processor 3008 can be configured to adopt the second configuration while the angle between the vector D and the gravity vector g is greater than or equal to about 80 degrees. The processor 3008 can be configured to adopt the second configuration while the angle between the vector D and the gravity vector g is greater than or equal to about 90 degrees. The processor 3008 can be configured to adopt the second configuration while the angle between the vector D and the gravity vector g is greater than or equal to about 100 degrees. The reader will appreciate that the described orientations and/or positions of the handle assembly 2202 and their corresponding configurations which are adopted by the processor 3008 are exemplary in nature and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure. The processor 3008 can be configured to adopt various other configurations in connection with various other orientations and/or positions of the handle assembly 2202. Referring to FIG. 15 the surgical instrument 2200 can be controlled and/or operated, or at least partially controlled and/or operated, by input from an operator received through a display such as the display 2250; the display 2250 may comprise a touchscreen adapted to receive the input from the operator which can be in the form of one or more touch gestures. The display 2250 is coupled to a processor such as the processor 3008 which is configured to cause the surgical instrument 2200 to perform various functions in response to the touch gestures provided by the operator. The display 2250 may comprise a capacitive touchscreen, a resistive touchscreen, or any suitable touchscreen. Referring again to FIG. 15, the display 2250 comprises a plurality of icons which can be associated with a plurality of functions that can be performed by the surgical instrument 2200. The processor 3008 is configured to cause the surgical instrument 2200 to perform a function when an icon representing such function is selected, touched, and/or pressed by the operator of the surgical instrument 2200. A memory such as the memory 3010 comprises one or more modules for associating the plurality of icons with the plurality of functions. As illustrated in FIG. 15, the display 2250 includes a firing icon 10014. The processor 3008 is configured to detect a firing input signal when the operator touches and/or presses the firing icon 10014. In response to the detection of the firing input signal, the processor 3008 is configured to activate the motor 2216 to motivate a firing member of the surgical instrument 2200 to fire the staples from the staple cartridge 10006 and/or cut tissue captured between the anvil 10002 and the staple cartridge 10006. As illustrated in FIG. 15, the display 2250 includes an articulation icon 10016 for articulating the end effector 2208 in a first direction such as a clockwise direction; the display 2250 also includes an articulation icon 10018 for articulating the end effector 2208 in a second direction such as a counterclockwise direction. The reader will appreciate that the display 2250 may comprise various other icons associated with various other functions that the processor 3008 may cause the surgical instrument 2200 to perform when such icons are selected, touched, and/or pressed by the operator of the surgical instrument 2200. One or more of the icons of the display 2250 may comprise words, symbols, and/or images representing the function that can be performed by touching or pressing the icons. The articulation icon 10016 may show an image of the end effector 2208 articulated in the clockwise direction. The articulation icon 10018 may show an image of the end effector 2208 articulated in the counterclockwise direction. The firing icon 10014 may show an image of the staples being fired from the staple cartridge 10006. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 16, the interface 3001 of the surgical instrument 2200 comprises a plurality of operational controls such as a closure trigger 10020, a rotation knob 10022, the articulation rocker 3012, and/or a firing input 3017 (FIG. 17). Various operational controls of the interface 3001 of the surgical instrument 2200 may serve, in addition to their operational functions, as navigational controls. The surgical instrument 2200 may comprise an operational mode and a navigational mode. In the operational mode, some or all of the controls of the surgical instrument 2200 are configured to perform operational functions; and in the navigational mode, some or all of the controls of the surgical instrument 2200 are configured to perform navigational functions. The navigational functions performed by some or all of the controls of the surgical instrument 2200 can be related to, associated with, and/or connected to the operational functions performed by the controls. In other words, the operational functions performed by the controls of the surgical instrument 2200 may define the navigational functions performed by such controls. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 16 a processor such as the processor 3008 is configured to toggle between a primary interface configuration while the surgical instrument 2200 is in the operational mode and a secondary interface configuration while the surgical instrument 2200 is in the navigational mode; the processor 3008 is configured to assign operational functions to some or all of the controls of the interface 3001 in the operational mode and assign navigational functions to such controls in the navigational mode. The navigational functions of the controls in the secondary interface configuration are defined by the operational functions of the controls in the primary interface configuration. Referring to FIGS. 16 the operator of the surgical instrument 2200 may activate the navigational mode by opening or activating a navigational menu 10024 in the display 2250. The surgical instrument 2200 may instead comprise a navigational mode button or a switch (not shown) for activating the navigational mode. In any event, the processor 3008 switches the controls of the interface 3001 from the primary interface configuration to the secondary interface configuration upon receiving a navigational mode input signal.

The navigational menu 10024 comprises an articulation category, a firing category, a closure category, a battery category and/or, rotation category. The articulation rocker 3012 is utilized to articulate the end effector 2208, in the operational mode, as described above, and can be utilized to select the articulation category, and/or launch and/or navigate an articulation menu in the navigational mode. The firing input 3017 (FIG. 17) is utilized to fire the staples, in the operational mode, as described above, and can be utilized to select the firing category, and/or launch and/or navigate a firing menu in the navigational mode.

The rotation knob 10022 is utilized to rotate the end effector 2208 relative to the elongate shaft 2204 in the operational mode, and can be utilized to select the rotation category, and/or launch and/or navigate a rotation menu in the navigational mode. Referring primarily to FIGS. 1 and 17, the operation of the surgical instrument 2200 may involve a series or a sequence of steps, actions, events, and/or combinations thereof. As illustrated in FIG. 17, the surgical instrument 2200 includes an indicator system 10030 which is configured to guide, alert, and/or provide feedback to the operator of the surgical instrument 2200 with respect to the various steps, actions, and/or events.

The operation of the surgical instrument 2200 may include various steps including an articulation step, a closure step, a firing step, a firing reset step, a closure reset step, an articulation reset step, and/or combinations thereof. The articulation step involves articulating the end effector 2208 relative to the elongate shaft 2204 to an articulated position; and the articulation reset step involves returning the end effector 2208 to an articulation home state position. The closure step involves transitioning the end effector 2208 to a closed configuration; and the closure reset step involves transitioning the end effector 2208 to an open configuration. The firing step involves advancing a firing member to deploy staples from the staple cartridge 10006 and/or cut tissue captured by the end effector 2208. The firing reset step involves retraction of the firing member to a firing home state position. Referring to FIG. 17, one or more of the indicators 10032 of the indicator system 10030 can be associated with one or more of the various steps performed in connection with the operation of the surgical instrument 2200.

Referring to FIG. 17 the indicators 10032 associated with one of the steps of operation of the surgical instrument 10030 may also be associated with the controls employed in such steps. For example, the articulation indicator 10034 can be associated with the articulation rocker 3012, the closure indicator 10036 can be associated with the closure trigger 10020, the firing indicator 10038 can be associated with the firing input 3017, and/or the firing reset indicator 10044 can be associated with the home state input 3014. Associating an indicator with a control of the interface 3001 may include placing or positioning the indicator on, within, partially within, near, and/or in close proximity to the control to aid the operator in associating the indicator with the control. The reader will appreciate that the above described controls and/or the indicators associated with such controls are exemplary in nature and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure. Various other controls and the indicators associated with such controls are contemplated by the present disclosure. The processor 3008 is configured to activate the indicators 10032 in one or more sequences defined by the order of the steps associated with the indicators 10032. For example, the operator may need to operate the surgical instrument 2200 in a series of steps starting with the articulation step followed by the closure step, and further followed by the firing step. In such example, the processor 3008 is configured to guide the operator through the sequence of steps by activating the corresponding articulation indicator 10034, closure indicator 10036, and firing indicator 10038 in the same order as the order of the steps. In other words, the processor 3008 is configured to first activate the articulation indicator 10034 followed by the closure indicator 10036, and further followed by the firing indicator 10038. The surgical instrument 2200 may comprise a bypass switch (not shown) which is configured to allow the operator to bypass a step that is recommended but not required. In such instances, pressing the bypass switch signals the processor 3008 to activate the next indicator in the sequence. The processor 3008 can be configured to toggle the indicators 10032 between a plurality of indicator configurations to guide, alert, and/or provide feedback to the operator of the surgical instrument 2200. The processor 3008 may provide visual cues to the operator of the surgical instrument 2200 by the toggling of the indicators 10032 between the plurality of indicator configurations which may include activated and/or deactivated configurations. One or more of the indicators 10032 may comprise a light source which can be activated in a first indicator configuration to alert the operator to perform a step associated with the indicators 10032; and the light source can be deactivated in a second indicator configuration to alert the operatorwhen the step is completed. The light source can be a blinking light which can be transitioned by the processor 3008 between a blinking configuration and a non-blinking configuration. The blinking light, in the non-blinking configuration, may be transitioned to solid illumination or turned off. The blinking light, in the blinking configuration, may represent a waiting period while a step is in progress. The blinking frequency of the blinking light may be changed to provide various visual cues. For example, the blinking frequency of the blinking light that represents a waiting period may be increased or decreased as the waiting period approaches its completion. The reader will appreciate that the waiting period can be a forced waiting period and/or a recommended waiting period. In certain instances, forced waiting periods can be represented by a blinking configuration different from recommended waiting periods. The blinking light may comprise a first color representing a forced waiting period and a second color representing a recommended waiting period, wherein the first color is different from the second color. The first color can be a red color and the second color can be a yellow color. In various instances, one or more of the indicators 10032 can be toggled by the processor 3008 between a first indicator configuration representing controls that are available for use in a standard next step of the steps of operation of the surgical instrument 2200, a second indicator configuration representing controls that are available for use in a non-standard next step of the steps of operation of the surgical instrument 2200, and/or a third indicator configuration representing controls that are not available for use in a next step of the steps of operation of the surgical instrument 2200. For instance, when the end effector 2208 of the surgical instrument 2000 is in an open configuration, the articulation indicator 10034 and the closure indicator 10036 can be illuminated indicating to the operator of the surgical instrument 2200 that those two functions, i.e., end effector articulation and end effector closure, are available to the operator at that moment. In such a state, the firing indicator 10038 is not illuminated, indicating to the operator that the firing function is not available to the operator at that moment. Once the end effector 2208 has been placed in a closed and/or clamped configuration, the articulation indicator 10034 is deilluminated indicating to the operator that the articulation function is no longer available at that moment. In such a state, the illumination of the closure indicator 10036 may be reduced indicating to the operator that the closing function can be reversed at that moment. Moreover, in such a state, the firing indicator 10038 can become illuminated indicating to the operator that the firing function is available to the operator at that moment. Once the firing member has been at least partially advanced, the closure indicator 10036 is deilluminated indicating that the closing function cannot be reversed at that moment. When the firing member is retracted back to its unfired position, the illumination of the firing indicator 10038 may be reduced indicating to the operator that the firing member can be readvanced, if needed. Alternatively, once the firing member has been retracted, the firing indicator 10038 is deilluminated indicating to the operator that the firing member cannot be readvanced at that moment. In either event, the closure indicator 10036 is reilluminated after the firing member has been retracted back to its unfired position indicating to the operator that the closing function can be reversed at that moment. The articulation indicator 10034 remains deilluminated indicating that the articulation function is not available at that moment. Once the end effector 2208 has been opened, the firing indicator 10038 is deilluminated, if it hadn't been deilluminated already, indicating to the operator that the firing function is not available at that moment, the closing indicator 10036 remains illuminated or its illumination is reduced indicating to the operator that the closing function is still available at that moment, and the articulation indicator 10034 is reilluminated indicating to the operator that the articulation function is available at that moment. The example provided above is exemplary and other embodiments are possible. The one or more of the indicators 10032 may include a light source that can be toggled by the processor 3008 between a first color in the first indicator configuration, a second color in the second indicator configuration, and/or a third color in the third indicator configuration. The indicators 10032 can be toggled by the processor 3008 between the first indicator configuration, the second indicator configuration, and/or the third indicator configuration by changing the light intensity of the light source or scanning through the color spectrum. The first indicator configuration may comprise a first light intensity the second indicator configuration may comprise a second light intensity and/or the third indicator configuration may comprise a third indicator configuration. In the firing step of operation of the surgical instrument 2200, the firing member can be motivated to deploy the plurality of staples from the staple cartridge 10006 into tissue captured between the anvil 10002 and the staple cartridge 10006, and advance a cutting member (not shown) to cut the captured tissue. The reader will appreciate that advancing the cutting member to cut the captured tissue in the absence of a staple cartridge or in the presence of a spent staple cartridge may be undesirable. Accordingly the surgical instrument 2200 comprises a lockout mechanism (not shown) which can be activated to prevent advancement of the cutting member in the absence of a staple cartridge or in the presence of a spent staple cartridge. Referring to FIG. 18, a module 10046 is employed by an indicator system such as the indicator system 10030 (FIG. 17). The module 10046 comprises program instructions stored in one or more memory units such as the memory 3010, which when executed cause the processor 3008 to employ the indicators 10032 to alert, guide, and/or provide feedback to the operator of the surgical instrument 2200 during the firing step of operation of the surgical instrument 2200. One or more of the indicators 10032 such as the firing indicator 10038 and/or the firing reset indicator 10044 can be toggled by the processor 3008 between the first indicator configuration, the second indicator configuration, and/or the third indicator configuration to alert, guide, and/or provide feedback to the operator of the surgical instrument 2200 during the firing step of operation of the surgical instrument 2200. Referring to FIGS. 17 and 18, the operator of the surgical instrument 2200 may actuate the firing input 3017 to cause the processor 3008 to activate the motor 2216 to motivate the firing member to deploy the plurality of staples from the staple cartridge 10006 into the captured tissue and advance the cutting member to cut the captured tissue. The firing indicator 10038 is set to the first indicator configuration to alert the operator that the firing input 3017 is available for use and/or is one of the standard control options available for completion of the firing step. As illustrated in FIGS. 17 and 18, if the processor 3008 detects that the lockout mechanism is active, the processor 3008 stops the advancement of the cutting member by stopping and/or deactivating the motor 2216. In addition, the processor 3008 is configured to transition the firing indicator 10038 from the first indicator configuration to the third indicator configuration to caution the operator that the firing input 3017 is not available for use. The processor 3008 is also configured to illuminate the display 2250 and display an image of a missing staple cartridge. The processor 3008 also sets the firing reset indicator 10044 to the first indicator configuration to inform the operator that home state input 3014 is available for use to motivate the firing member to retract the cutting member to the firing home state position. The processor 3008 is configured to detect the installation of a new staple cartridge, through the sensors 10035 for example, and in response, return the firing indicator 10038 to the first indicator configuration. As illustrated in FIG. 18, if the operator releases the firing input 3017 before completion of the firing step, the processor 3008 is configured to stop the motor 2216. The processor 3008 also maintains the firing indicator 10038 in the first indicator configuration to alert the operator that the firing input 3017 is available for use as the standard control option available for completion of the firing step of operation of the surgical instrument 2200. The processor 3008 also sets the firing reset indicator 10044 to the second indicator configuration to inform the operator that home state input 3014 is available for use as a non-standard control option available for use to retract the cutting member to the firing home state position if the operator decides to abort the firing step of operation of the surgical instrument 2200. As illustrated in FIG. 18, if the firing input 3017 is re-actuated by the operator, the processor 3008, in response, reactivates the motor 2216 to continue advancing the cutting member until the cutting member is fully advanced. The processor 3008 employs the sensors 10035 to detect when the cutting member is fully advanced; the processor 3008 then reverses the direction of rotation of the motor 2216 to motivate the firing member to retract the cutting member to the firing home state position. The processor 3008 is configured to stop the motor 2216 and/or set the closure reset indicator 10042 to the first indicator configuration if the processor detects that the cutting member has reached the firing home state position. As described herein, a surgical instrument can enter into various operational states, modes, and/or configurations. The instrument may enter into an operational state, mode, and/or configuration that is undesired by the operator who may be unsure as to how to remove the instrument from that undesired state, mode, and/or configuration. The surgical instrument can include a reset button which, when actuated, can place the instrument in a default state, mode, and/or configuration. For instance, the default state, mode, and/or configuration can comprise an operational mode, and not a navigational mode. The default state and/or configuration can comprise a certain orientation of the display output 2250. The reset button is in signal communication with the processor 3008 which places the surgical instrument in the default state, mode, and/or configuration. In certain instances, the processor 3008 can be configured to hold the surgical instrument in the default state, mode, and/or configuration. The surgical instrument can include a lock button which, when actuated, locks the surgical instrument in its default state, mode, and/or configuration. In certain instances, a lock button can lock the surgical instrument in its current state, mode, and/or configuration. The operational state, mode, and/or configuration can be unlocked by actuating the lock button once again. The surgical instrument includes at least one accelerometer in signal communication with the processor 3008 which can determine when the instrument handle is being shaken or being moved back and forth quickly. When such shaking is sensed, the processor 3008 places the surgical instrument into a default operation state, mode, and/or configuration. Referring to FIG. 19 a surgical assembly 10050 includes a surgical instrument such as the surgical instrument 2200 and a remote operating unit 10052. The surgical instrument 2200 comprises a primary interface such as the interface 3001 which resides in the handle assembly 2202, as illustrated in FIG. 1. The interface 3001 may include a plurality of primary controls such as the closure trigger 10020 (FIG. 1), the rotation knob 10022, the articulation rocker 3012, the home state input 3014, and/orthe firing input 3017 (FIG. 17). An operator of the surgical instrument 2200 may manually operate the primary controls of the interface 3001 to perform a surgical procedure. As described above, the operator may actuate the articulation rocker 3012 to activate the motor 2216 to articulate the end effector 2208 between an unarticulated position and an articulated position. The operator may actuate the closure trigger 10020 to transition the end effector 2208 between an open configuration and a closed configuration. The operator may actuate the firing input 3017 to activate the motor 2216 to motivate the firing member of the surgical instrument 2200 to fire the staples from the staple cartridge 10006 and/or cut tissue captured between the anvil 10002 and the staple cartridge 10006. The operator of the surgical instrument 2200 may not be sufficiently close in proximity to the handle assembly 2202 to be able to manually operate the interface 3001. For example, the operator may operate the surgical instrument 2200 together with a robotically-controlled surgical system, which may be controlled from a remote location. In such instances, the operator may need to operate the surgical instrument 2200 from the remote location where the operator operates the robotically-controlled surgical system; the operator may employ the remote operating unit 10052 to operate the surgical instrument 2200 remotely. Various robotic systems, instruments, components, and methods are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 13/118,241, entitled SURGICAL STAPLING INSTRUMENTS WITH ROTATABLE STAPLE DEPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS, now U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0298719, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Referring to FIGS. 19 and 20, the remote operating unit 10052 includes a secondary interface 3001', a display 2250', and/or a power assembly 2206' (or "power source" or "power pack"). The secondary interface 3001' includes a plurality of secondary controls which correspond to the primary controls of the primary interface 3001'. The remote operating unit 10052 may include a remote articulation rocker 3012' corresponding to the articulation rocker 3012. The remote operating unit 10052 may include a remote firing input 3017' corresponding to the firing input 3017 of the surgical instrument 2200. The remote operating unit 10052 may include a remote home state input 3014' corresponding to the home state input 3014 of the surgical instrument 2200. As illustrated in FIG. 19, the remote operating unit 10052, the interface 3001', and/or the plurality of secondary controls may comprise a different shape and/or design from the handle assembly 2202, the interface 3001, and/or the plurality of primary controls. As illustrated in FIG. 20, the remote operating unit 10052, the interface 3001', and/or the plurality of secondary controls may comprise the same, or at least substantially the same, shape and/or design to the handle assembly 2202, the interface 3001, and/orthe plurality of primary controls, respectively. In various instances, as illustrated in FIGS. 19 and 20, the remote operating unit 10052 is coupled to the handle assembly 2202 of the surgical instrument 2200 via an elongate flexible cable 10054 which is configured to transmit various actuation signals to the processor 3008 of the surgical instrument 2200; the various actuation signals are generated by actuating the plurality of secondary controls of the interface 3001'. As illustrated in FIG. 21, the remote operating unit 10052 comprises a transmitter 10056 which is configured to wirelessly transmit the actuation signals generated by the secondary controls of the secondary interface 3001' from the remote operating unit 10052 to the processor 3001 through a receiver 10058 which can be located in the handle assembly 2202. The surgical instrument 2200 and/or the remote operating unit 10052 includes communication activation inputs (not shown). Actuating the communication activation inputs is a precursory step to establishing communication between the surgical instrument 2200 and the remote operating unit 10052; once communication is established, the operator may employ the remote operating unit 10052 to remotely control the surgical instrument 2200. The memory 3010 includes program instructions for a puppet mode, which when executed causes the processor 3008 to respond to the actuation signals generated by the plurality of secondary controls of the secondary interface 3001' in the same, or at least similar, manner to the response of the processor 3008 to the actuation signals generated by the plurality of primary controls of the primary interface 3001. In other words, the responses of the processor 3008 to the actuation signals generated by the plurality of secondary controls can be configured to mimic the responses of the processor 3008 to the actuation signals generated by the plurality of primary controls. Actuation of the remote firing input 3017' may solicit the same, or at least a similar, response from the processor 3008 as the actuation of the firing input 3017; the solicited response may include activation of the motor 2216 to motivate the firing member to fire the staples from the staple cartridge 10006 and/or cut tissue captured between the anvil 10002 and the staple cartridge 10006. Actuation of the remote articulation rocker 3012' may solicit the same, or at least a similar, response from the processor 3008 as the actuation of the articulation rocker 3012; the solicited response may include activation of the motor 2216 to articulate the end effector 2208 relative to the elongate shaft 2204. The processor 3008 can be configured to require input actuation signals from both of the primary controls of the primary interface 3001 and the corresponding secondary controls of the secondary interface 3001' to perform the function solicited by such controls. In such instances, the remote operator of the remote operating unit 10052 may need the assistance of an additional operator who can be employed to manually actuate the primary controls of the primary interface 3001 while the remote operator actuates the secondary controls of the secondary interface 3001'. As described above, an operator may operate the surgical instrument 2200 together with a robotically-controlled surgical system, which may be controlled by a robotic control system from a remote location. The remote operating unit 10052 can be configured to work in tandem with the robotic control system. The robotic control system may include one or more control ports; and the remote operating unit 10052 may comprise connection means for coupling engagement with the control ports of the robotic control system. In such instances, the operator may operate the surgical instrument 2200 through an interface of the robotic control system. The control ports may comprise unique mechanical and/or electrical configurations which may require the use of original equipment manufacturer components to ensure consistent product quality and performance. The remote operating unit 10052 includes various indicators 10032' which are similar in many respects to the indicators 10032 of the handle assembly 2202. The indicators 10032' of the remote operating unit 10052 are employed by the processor 3008 in the same, or at least substantially the same, manner as the indicators 10032 to guide, alert, and/or provide feedback to the operator with respect to the various steps of operation of the surgical instrument 2200. The remote operating unit 10052 may include various feedback devices 2248' which can be similar in many respects to the feedback devices 2248 of the handle assembly 2202. The feedback devices 2248' of the remote operating unit 10052 are employed by the processor 3008 in the same, or at least substantially the same, manner as the feedback devices 2248 to provide sensory feedback to the operator with respect to the various steps of operation of the surgical instrument 2200. Similar to the feedback devices 2248, the feedback devices 2248' may include visual feedback devices, audio feedback devices, tactile feedback devices, and/or combinations thereof. In various instances, as illustrated in FIG. 22, the remote operating unit 10052 can be included or integrated with a first surgical instrument 10060 and can be utilized to operate a second surgical instrument 10062. The first surgical instrument 10060 can reside in a surgical field 10065 and can be manually operated by the operator from within the surgical field 10065; and the second surgical instrument 10062 can reside outside the surgical field 10065. To avoid exiting the surgical field 10065, the operator may use the remote operating unit 10052 to remotely operate the second surgical instrument 10062 from within the surgical field 10065. The second surgical instrument 10062 may be a circular stapler. The entire disclosure of U.S. Patent No. 8,360,297, entitled SURGICAL CUTTING AND STAPLING INSTRUMENT WITH SELF ADJUSTING ANVIL, which issued on January 29, 2013, is incorporated by reference herein. The first surgical instrument 10060 and/or the second surgical instrument 10062 include communication activation inputs (not shown). In such instances, actuating the communication activation inputs are a precursory step to establishing communication between the first surgical instrument 10060 and the second surgical instrument 10062; once communication is established, the operator may employ the remote operating unit 10052 to remotely control the second surgical instrument 10062. In various instances, a surgical system can include modular components that can be attached and/or combined together to form a surgical instrument. The modular components can be designed, manufactured, programmed, and/or updated at different times and/or in accordance with different software and/or firmware revisions and updates. For example, referring primarily to FIGS. 23 and 24, a surgical instrument 100 include includes a first modular component 110, such as a handle and a second modular component 120, such as a shaft 122 and an end effector 124 which are described in greater detail herein. The first modular component 110 and the second modular component 120 can be assembled together to form the modular surgical instrument 100 or at least a portion thereof. Optionally, a different modular component may be coupled to the first modular component 110, such as shaft having different dimensions and/or features than those of the second modular component 120. The surgical instrument can include additional modular components, such as a modular battery. Components of the modular surgical instrument 100 can include a control system that is designed and configured to control various elements and/or functions of the surgical instrument 100. For example, the first modular component 110 and the second modular component 120 can each comprise a control system, and the control systems of each modular component 110,120 can communicate and/or cooperate. The first modular component 110 may have been designed, manufactured, programmed, and/or updated at a different time and/or with different software and/or firmware than the second modular component 120. Referring now to FIG. 25, the assembled surgical system includes a first control system 150' and a second control system 150. The control systems 150', 150 are in signal communication. The second modular component 120 comprises the control system 150 which can include a plurality of control modules 152. The control modules 152 effect a surgical function with and/or by an element or subsystem of the surgical instrument 100. The control modules 152 can effect a surgical function based on a pre-programmed routine, operator input, and/or system feedback. The first modular component 110 also comprises a control system 150' which can include a plurality of control modules 152'. The control system 150' and/or one of the control modules 152' of the first modular component 110 may be different than the control system 150 and/or one of the control modules 152 of the second modular component 120. Though the control systems 150 and 150' can be different, the control systems 150 and 150' can be configured to control corresponding functions. For example, the control module 152(a) and the control module 152(a)' can both issue commands to firmware modules 158 to implement a firing stroke. One of the control systems 150, 150' and/or a control module 152, 152' thereof may include updated software and/or firmware and/or can have a more-recent effective date, as described in greater detail herein. A control module 152, 152' can comprise software, firmware, a program, a module, and/or a routine and/or can include multiple software, firmware, programs, control modules, and/or routines. The control systems 150, 150' can include multiple tiers and/or levels of command. For example, the control system 150 includes a first tier 144 of control modules 152, a second tier 146 of control modules 152, and/or a third tier 148 of control modules 152. Control modules 152 of the first tier 144 are configured to issue commands to the control modules 152 of the second tier 146 and the control modules 152 of the second tier 146 are configured to issue commands to the control modules 152 of the third tier 148. The control systems 150, 150' can include fewer than three tiers and/or more than three tiers. Referring still to FIG. 25, the control module(s) 152 in the first tier 144 comprise high-level software, or a clinical algorithm 154. The clinical algorithm 154 controls the high-level functions of the surgical instrument 100. The control module(s) 152 in the second tier 146 comprise intermediate software, or framework module(s) 156, which control the intermediate-level functions of the surgical instrument 100. The clinical algorithm 154 of the first tier 144 can issue abstract commands to the framework module(s) 156 of the second tier 146 to control the surgical instrument 100. Furthermore, the control modules 152 in the third tier 148 comprise firmware modules 158 which can be specific to a particular hardware component 160, or components, of the surgical instrument 100. For example, the firmware modules 158 can correspond to a particular cutting element, firing bar, trigger, sensor, and/or motor of the surgical instrument 100, and/or can correspond to a particular subsystem of the surgical instrument 100. A framework module 156 issues commands to a firmware module 158 to implement a surgical function with the corresponding hardware component 160. Accordingly, the various control modules 152 of the surgical system 100 can communicate and/or cooperate during a surgical procedure. Referring still to FIG. 25, the control system 150 of the second component 120 corresponds to the control system 150' of the first component 110, and the various control modules 152 of the second component 120 correspond to the control modules 152' of the first component 110. Stated differently, each control module 152 includes a parallel, or corresponding control module 152', and both control modules 152 and 152' are configured to perform identical, similar and/or related functions and/or to provide identical, similar and/or related commands. Referring still to FIG. 25, the control module 152a corresponds to the control module 152a'. For example, the control modules 152a and 152a' can both control the firing stroke of a cutting element; however, control module 152a can be configured to control a first cutting element design or model number and control module 152a' can be configured to control a different cutting element design or model number. In other instances, the control module 152a' can comprise a software program and control module 152a can comprise an updated or revised version of the software program. The first component 110 of the surgical instrument 100 includes a clinical algorithm 154' that is different than the clinical algorithm 154 of the second component 120. Additionally and/or alternatively, the first component 110 includes a framework module 156' that is different than a corresponding framework module 156 of the second component 120, and/or the first component 110 include a firmware module 158' that is different than a corresponding firmware module 158 of the second component 120. Corresponding control modules 152,152' can comprise different effective dates. A person having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the effective date of a control module 152, 152' can correspond to a date that the control module 152,152' was designed, created, programmed, and/or updated. The effective date of a control module can be recorded or stored in the program code of the control module. In certain instances, a control module of the surgical instrument 100 can be outdated. Furthermore, an out-of-date, or less-recently updated, control module may be incompatible with, disjointed from, and/or disconnected from an up-to-date and/or more-recently updated, control module. Accordingly it may be desirable to update out-of-date control modules to ensure proper and effective operation of the surgical instrument 100. In various instances, a modular component of the surgical system includes a predetermined default, or master, control system. In such instances, if the control systems of the assembled modular components are different, the default control system can update, overwrite, revise, and/or replace the non-default control systems. In other words, if corresponding control modules are different, incompatible, or inconsistent the non-default control module can be updated and the default control module can be preserved. For example, if the handle 110 comprises the control system 150', which is the non-default control system, and the shaft 120 comprises the control system 150, which is the master control system, the control system 150' of the handle 110 can be updated based on the control system 150 of the shaft 120. It may be desirable to program a shaft component 120 of the surgical instrument to include the default control system in circumstances where shaft components are more frequently updated and/or modified than handle components. For example, if new generations and/or iterations of shaft components 120 are introduced more frequently than new generations and/or iterations of handle components 110, it may be advantageous to include a default, or master, control system in the shaft component 120 of the modular surgical instrument 100. Various circumstances described throughout the present disclosure relate to updating control modules of a handle component based on control modules of the shaft component; however, a person of skill in the art will readily appreciate that, in other contemplated circumstances, the control modules of the shaft component and/or a different modular component may be updated instead of or in addition to the control modules of the handle component. The surgical instrument 100 (FIGS. 23 and 24) compares the control module(s) 152' at each tier or level in the control system 150' to the control module(s) 152 at each corresponding tier or level in the control system 150. If the control modules 152 and 152' in corresponding tiers are different, a control system 150, 150' updates the non-default control module(s). Referring to FIG. 26, at step 201, the control system 150 and/or the control system 150' can compare the control module(s) 152' of the first tier 144' of the first component 110 to the control module(s) 152 of the first tier 144 of the second component 120. Where the first tiers 144, 144' comprise high-level clinical algorithms 154, 154', respectively, the control system 150 and/or the control system 150' compares the clinical algorithms 154 and 154'. Furthermore, at step 203, if the control modules 152, 152' in the first tiers 144, 144' are different, the control system 150 and/or the control system 150' updates the module(s) 152' of the first tier 144' with the default module(s) 152 of the first tier 144. The control system 150 compares and/or updates a control system and/or control modules and, in other circumstances, the control system 150' can compare and update a control system and/or control modules. One of the control systems 150,150' can be configured to compare and/or update a control system and/or control modules and, in other instances, both control systems 150, 150' can be configured to compare and/or update a control system and/or control modules. At step 205, the control system 150 and/or the control system 150' compares the control modules 152' of the second tier 146' of the first component 110 to the control modules 152 of the second tier 146 of the second component 120. For example, where the second tiers 146, 146' comprise mid-level framework algorithms 156, 156', the control systems 150,150' can compare the framework algorithms 156 and 156'. At step 207, if the modules 152, 152' in the second tiers 146, 146' are different, the control systems 150, 150' update the control modules 152' of the second tier 146' with the default control modules 152 of the second tier 146. Though one or more of the control modules 152' in the second tier 146' can be the same as a corresponding module 152 in the second tier 146, all control modules 152' of the second tier 146' can be updated if any corresponding second tier modules 152,152' are different. In other instances, as described in greater detail herein, only the control module(s) 152' that is/are different than the corresponding module(s) 152 may be updated. At step 209, the control systems 150 and/or the control system 150' compares the control modules 152' of the third tier 148' of the first component 110 to the control modules 152 of the third tier 148 of the second component 120. For example, where the third tiers 148, 148' comprise firmware modules 158, 158', the control system 150 and/or the control system 150' can compare the firmware modules 158 and 158'. If the modules 152, 152' in the third tiers 148,148' are different, the control system 150 and/or the control system 150' can update the control modules 152' of the third tier 148' with the default control modules 152 of the third tier 148 at step 211. Though one or more of the control modules 152' in the third tier 148' can be the same as a corresponding control module 152 in the third tier 148, all modules 152' of the third tier 148' can be updated if any corresponding third tier modules 152, 152' are different. In other instances, only the control module(s) 152' that is/are different than the corresponding control module(s) 152 may be updated, as described in greater detail herein. Referring still to FIG. 26, the first tier control modules 154, 154' can be updated prior to the second tier control modules 156,156' and the second tier control modules 156, 156' can be updated prior to the third tier control modules 158, 158'. In other instances, as described in greater detail herein, the third tier control modules 158, 158' can be updated prior to the second tier control modules 156, 156' and the second tier control modules 156, 156' can be updated before the first tier control modules 154, 154'. As described above, the control system 150 and/or the control system 150' compares the control system 150,150' and/or the control modules 152, 152' thereof prior to updating, replacing and/or overwriting an outdated control module 152, 152' and/or control systems 150, 150'. A reader will appreciate that this step can reduce the instrument startup time when software updates and/or upgrades are unnecessary or unmerited. Alternatively, the comparison steps 201, 205, and 209 could be eliminated, and the control systems 150, 150' may automatically update, replace, revise and/or overwrite the control module(s) 152' of the first modular component 110 and/or specific, predetermined control module(s) 152 of the first modular component 110. The control modules 152,152' can be compared and updated on a tier-by-tier basis and, in other instances, the control systems 150, 150' can be compared and updated on a system-by-system basis. In still other instances, the control modules 152,152' can be updated on a module-by-module basis. For example, referring now to FIG. 27, at step 221, a third tier module 158' of the first control system 150' can be compared to a corresponding third tier module 158 of the second control system 150. The effective date of the third tier module 158' can be compared to the effective date of the corresponding third tier module 158. Moreover, the control system 150 and/or the control system 150' can determine if the effective date of the third tier module 158' postdates the effective date of the third tier module 158. If the third tier module 158' is newer than the third tier module 158 the third tier module 158' can be preserved at step 225. Conversely, if the third tier module 158' is not newer than the third tier module 158, i.e., the third tier module 158 predates the corresponding third tier module 158 or the third tier module 158 and the corresponding third tier module 158' have the same effective date, the third tier module 158' can be updated, replaced, revised, and/or overwritten by the corresponding third tier module 158. Furthermore steps 221 and either 223 or 225 can be repeated for each module 158, 158' in the third tier of the control systems 150, 150'. Accordingly, the modules 158' in the third tier 148' may be updated on a module-by-module basis, and in various instances, only outdated modules 158' can be updated and/or overwritten. Referring still to FIG. 27, after all third tier modules 158, 158' have been compared and possibly updated, the control systems 150, 150' can progress to step 227. At step 227, the control system 150 and/or the control system 150' can confirm that a third tier module 158' of the first control system 150' is connected and/or in proper communication with a second tier module 156' of the control system 150'. For example, in circumstances where the third tier module 158' was updated at step 223, the second tier module 156' may be disconnected from the updated third tier module 158'. If the third tier module 158' is disconnected from the second tier module 156' the second tier module 156' can be updated, replaced, revised, and/or overwritten at step 229. The second tier module 156' can be replaced by the corresponding second tier module 156 of the second control system 150. Conversely, if the third tier module 158' is properly connected and/or in communication with the second tier module 156', the second tier module 156' can be preserved. Furthermore steps 227 and either 229 or 231 can be repeated for each module 158, 158' in the third tier of the control systems 150, 150'. Accordingly, the modules 156' in the second tier 146' may be updated on a module-by-module basis, and in various instances, only disconnected modules 156' can be updated or overwritten. After updating any outdated third tier modules 158' (steps 221 and 223) and ensuring all updated third tier modules 158', if any, are connected to the appropriate second tier module 156' on the first modular component 110 (steps 227, 229, and 231), the control systems 150, 150' can progress to step 233, wherein the first tier module 154' of the first control system 150' can be compared to a corresponding first tier module 154 of the second control system 150. If the first tier modules 154,154' are the same, the updating and/or revising process can be complete. Conversely, if the first tier modules 154,154' are different, the first tier module 154' of the first control system 150' can be updated, replaced, revised, and/or overwritten by the first tier module 154 of the second control system 150. As described herein, the software and/or firmware modules of the modular components 110, 120 can be updated, revised, and/or replaced on a module-by-module, tier-by-tier, and/or system-by-system basis. The updating and/or revision process can be automatic when the modular components are attached and/or operably coupled. Alternatively, an operator of the surgical instrument 100 can initiate or trigger the updating and/or revision process described herein. A modular surgical instrument, such as the modular surgical instrument 100 (FIGS. 23 and 24 can include a microcontroller in signal communication with an engagement sensor and a display. The engagement sensor detects the relative positioning of modular components of the surgical system. Referring again to FIGS. 23 and 24, where the first modular component 110 comprises a handle and the second modular component 120 comprises a shaft an engagement sensor detects whether the shaft 120 is engaged with and/or operably coupled to the handle 110. The shaft 120 can be moveable between engagement with the handle 110 (FIG. 23) and disengagement from the handle 110 (FIG. 24). Referring primarily to FIGS. 28(A) and 28(B), an engagement sensor, such as the engagement sensor 602 is in signal communication with a microcontroller, such as the microcontroller 604, of a surgical system. The engagement sensor 602 detects whether the modular components 110, 120 are engaged or disengaged and communicates the engagement or lack thereof to the microcontroller 604. When the engagement sensor 602 indicates that the shaft 120 is engaged with the handle 110 the microcontroller 604 permits a surgical function by the modular surgical instrument 100 (FIG. 23). If the modular components 110, 120 are operably coupled an actuation of the firing trigger 112 (FIG. 23) on the handle 110 can effect, or at least attempt to effect, a firing motion in the shaft 120. Conversely, if the engagement sensor 602 indicates that the shaft 120 is disengaged from the handle 110, the microcontroller 604 prevents a surgical function. For example, if the modular components 110, 120 are disconnected, an actuation of the firing trigger 612 will not effect, or attempt to effect, a firing motion in the shaft 120. The modular surgical instrument 100 can include a display, such as the display 606 (FIG 28(B)). The display 606 can be integrated into one of the modular components 110, 120 of the surgical instrument 100 and/or can be external to the modular components 110, 120 and in signal communication with the microcontroller 604 of the surgical instrument 100. The microcontroller 604 communicates the information detected by the engagement sensor 602 to the display 606. For example, the display 606 depicts engagement and/or non-engagement of the modular components 110, 120. Moreover the display 606 can provide instructions and/or guidance regarding how to (a) properly attach, couple, and/or engage the disengaged components 110, 120 of the surgical instrument 100, and/or how to (b) properly detach, decouple, and/or disengage the engaged components 110, 120 of the surgical instrument 100. Referring again to FIG. 28(A) the engagement sensor 604 can comprise a Hall Effect switch, and in other instances, the engagement sensor can comprise a different and/or additional sensor and/or switch. The engagement sensor 604 detects the degree of engagement between modular components of a surgical instrument. In instances where the first component comprises the handle 110 and the second component comprises the shaft 120 the handle 110 and the shaft 120 can move between a disengaged position, a partially-engaged position, and an engaged position. The partially-engaged position can be intermediate the disengaged position and the engaged position and there may be multiple partially-engaged positions intermediate the engaged position and the disengaged position. The engagement sensor 604 can include a plurality of sensors, which can detect the partially-engaged position(s) of the components 110, 120. For example, the engagement sensor 606 comprises a plurality of sensors and/or electrical contacts which are staggered along an attachment portion of at least one of the modular components 110, 120. The engagement sensor(s) 604 can comprise a Hall Effect sensor. In certain instances, referring primarily to FIGS. 29(A) and 29(B), the surgical system 100 includes multiple sensors in signal communication with a microcontroller, such as the microcontroller 614. The multiple sensors include a first sensor 612 (FIG. 29(A)), which detects the presence of the first component 120, and communicates the presence of the first component 120 to the microcontroller 614. The first sensor 612 may not detect and/or communicate the degree of engagement between the first component 110 and the second component 120. A second sensor 613 (FIG. 29(A)) can also be in signal communication with the microcontroller 614. The second sensor 613 detects the degree of engagement between the modular components 110, 120. Similar to the control system depicted in FIGS. 28(A) and 28(B), the microcontroller 614 issues commands based on the feedback received from the sensors 612 and 613, and/or is in signal communication with a display to display the feedback and/or otherwise communicate with an operator of the surgical system. For example, the microcontroller 614 can prevent a surgical function until the modular components 110, 120 are in the engaged position, and can prevent a surgical function when the modular components 110, 120 are partially-engaged. Furthermore, the microcontroller 614 can communicate the information detected by the engagement sensor to a display. For example, the display depicts engagement, partial-engagement and/or non-engagement of the modular components 110, 120. Moreover the display can provide instructions and/or guidance regarding how to properly attach, couple, and/or engage disengaged and/or partially-engaged components 110,120 of the surgical instrument. The surgical instrument can include a microprocessor such as the microprocessor 604 (FIGS. 28(A) and 28(B)) or 614 (FIGS. 29(A) and 29(B)) which is in signal communication with a memory chip or memory unit. The microprocessor communicates data and/or feedback detected and/or calculated by the various sensors, programs, and/or circuits of the surgical instrument to the memory chip. Recorded data can relate to the time and/or duration of the surgical procedure, as well as the time and/or duration of various functions and/or portions of the surgical procedure. Additionally or alternatively, recorded data can relate to conditions at the treatment site and/or conditions within the surgical instrument. In certain instances, recordation of data can be automatic and, in other instances, the microprocessor may not record data unless and/or until instructed to record data. For example, it may be preferable to record data during a surgical procedure, maintain or store the recorded data in the memory chip, and/or transfer the recorded data to a secure site. Alternatively, it may be preferable to record data during a surgical procedure and delete the recorded data thereafter. A surgical instrument and/or microcontroller thereof can comprise a data storage protocol. The data storage protocol can provide rules for recording, processing, storing, transferring, and/or deleting data. The data storage protocol can be preprogrammed and/or updated during the lifecycle of the surgical instrument. The data storage protocol can mandate deletion of the recorded data after completion of a surgical function and/or surgical operation and, in other instances, the data storage protocol can mandate deletion of the recorded data after the elapse of a predefined period of time. For example, recorded data can be deleted, in accordance with the data storage protocol, one minute, one hour, one day, one week, one month or one year after the surgical function. The predefined period of time can be any suitable and appropriate period permitted by the circumstances. The data storage protocol can mandate deletion of the recorded data after a predefined number of surgical functions, such as firing strokes. In still other instances, the data storage protocol can mandate deletion of the recorded data when the surgical instrument is powered off. For example, referring to FIG. 31, if the surgical instrument is powered off, the microcontroller can proceed to step 709, wherein the microcontroller can determine if an error or major issue, such as an instrument, component or subsystem failure occurred during the surgical procedure. In various instances, if an error is detected, the microcontroller can proceed to step 713, wherein the data can be stored in the memory chip. Moreover if an error is not detected, the microcontroller can proceed to step 711, wherein the data can be deleted. In other instances, the data storage protocol may not comprise the step 709, and the data storage protocol can continue without checking for a major error or failure. In still other instances, the data storage protocol can mandate deletion of the recorded data after a predefined period of inactivity or stillness of the surgical instrument. For example, if the surgical instrument is set down and/or put into storage, the data storage protocol can mandate deletion of the recorded data after the surgical instrument has been still or idle for a predefined period of time. The requisite period of stillness can be one minute, one hour, one day, one week, one month, or one year. The predefined period of stillness can be any suitable and appropriate period permitted by the circumstances. The surgical instrument can include an accelerometer which can detect movement and stillness of the surgical instrument. Referring again to FIG. 31, when the surgical instrument has not been powered off at step 701, the accelerometer can be set to detect movement of the surgical instrument. If movement is detected at step 703, prior to lapsing of the predefined idle period at step 707, the predefined idle time count can be restarted at step 705. Conversely, if movement is not detected by the accelerometer prior to lapsing of the predefined idle period at step 707, the microprocessor can proceed to step 709. Alternatively, the microprocessor can proceed directly to step 711 or 713, depending on the data storage protocol, without checking for an instrument error or failure. As described herein, the data storage protocol can include one of more default rules for deleting recorded data. In certain instances, however, it may be desirable to override the default rule or procedure. For example, for research and/or development purposes, it may be desirable to store recorded data for a longer period of time. Additionally or alternatively, it may be desirable to store recorded data for teaching and/or investigative purposes. Moreover the data storage protocol may not include an error-checking step and, in such instances, it may be desirable to override the data storage protocol and ensure storage of data when the operator detects or suspects an error and/or anomaly during a surgical procedure. The recovered data can facilitate review of the procedure and/or a determination of the cause of the error. In various instances, a key or input may be required to overcome or override the standard data storage protocol. The key can be entered into the surgical instrument and/or a remote storage device, and can be entered by an operator and/or user of the surgical instrument. In various instances, a surgical system may prompt the user or instrument operator to select either data deletion or data storage for each surgical procedure or function. For example, the data storage protocol may mandate solicitation of instructions from the user, and may command subsequent action in accordance with the user's instructions. The surgical system may solicit instructions from the user upon the occurrence of a particular trigger event, such as powering down of the instrument, the elapse of a predefined period of time, or the completion of a particular surgical function. The surgical system can request input from a user when the surgical instrument is powered down. Referring to FIG. 30, when a user initiates powering off of a surgical instrument at step 801 the surgical system requests data storage instructions from the user. For example, at step 803, a display of the surgical system can ask, "KEEP DATA Y/N?" The microcontroller of the surgical system reads the user input at step 805. If the user requests storage of the data, the microcontroller proceeds to step 809, wherein the data is stored in a memory unit or memory chip of the surgical system. If the user requests deletion of the data, the microcontroller proceeds to step 811, wherein the data is erased. The user may not enter input. In such instances, the data storage protocol can mandate a particular process at step 813. For example, the data storage protocol may mandate "Process I", "Process II", or an alternative process. "Process I" can command the deletion of data at step 813(a), and "Process II" can command the storage of data at step 813(b). The user can provide instructions to the surgical instrument before instruction have been solicited. Additionally or alternatively, a display associated with the surgical system can request instruction from the user prior to initiating the surgical function and/or at different time(s) during instrument use. If data is stored in the memory of the surgical instrument, the data can be securely stored. For example, a code or key may be required to access the stored data. The access key can comprise an identification code. For example, the identification code can be specific to the operator, user, or owner of the surgical instrument. In such instances, only an authorized person can obtain a licensed identification code, and thus, only authorized personnel can access the stored data. Additionally or alternatively, the access key can be specific to the instrument and/or can be a manufacturer's code. The access key can comprise a secure server, and data can be transferred and/or accessed by an approved Bluetooth and/or radio frequency (RF) transmission. In still other circumstances, the access key can comprise a physical key, such as memory key and/or a data exchange port connector, which can be physically coupled to a data exchange port of the surgical instrument. In such instances, the access key can be preprogrammed to obtain access to the secure data, and to securely store and/or transfer the data. An access key can correspond to a specific surgical instrument. In various instances, data extraction from the memory device of a surgical instrument can be restricted by various security measures. The memory device of the surgical instrument can comprise a secure data connection or data exchange port. For example, the data exchange port can have a proprietary geometry or shape, and only authorized personnel can obtain a corresponding port key designed and structured to fit the proprietary geometry or shape. The data exchange port can comprise a mechanical lock, which can comprise a plug, a plurality of pins, and/or a plurality of springs. In various instances, a physical key or extraction device can unlock the mechanical lock of the data exchange port. For example, the physical key can contact the plurality of pins, deform the plurality of springs, and/or bias the plug from a locked orientation to an unlocked orientation to unlock the data exchange port. The data exchange port can comprise at least one connection pin, which can be biased and/or held in a first position. When a physical key is inserted into and/or engages the data exchange port, the physical key can bias the connection pin from the first position to a second position. The first position can comprise a retracted position and the second position can comprise an extended position. Moreover, when the connection pin is moved to the second position, the connection pin can operably interface with a data connection port in the physical key. Accordingly, the data exchange port of the memory device can move into signal communication with the data exchange port of the physical key via the connection pin such that data can be exchanged and/or transferred therebetween. The physical key can comprise a modular component which can be configured to removably attach to the modular surgical instrument. The physical key can replace or mimic a modular component 110, 120 of a surgical instrument 100 (FIGS. 23 and 24). For example, the physical key can attach to an attachment portion of the handle 110 in lieu of a shaft attachment 120 for the transfer of data from a memory device in the handle 120. Additionally or alternatively, the key or extraction device can comprise a security token. The data exchange port can be encrypted and/or the key can provide information or codes to the data exchange port to verify that the key is authorized and/or approved to extract data from the data exchange port. The key can comprise a specialized data reader and data can be transferred via an optical data transmission arrangement. Referring now to FIGS. 32(A)-32(C), before data access is granted to a proposed data reader, the data reader may need to be verified and/or confirmed by the surgical instrument. For example, the proposed data reader can request and read a checksum value of the surgical instrument at step 821. As depicted in the surgical instrument flowchart depicted in FIG. 32(C), the surgical instrument can first receive the proposed data reader request at step 841, and can then send the checksum value to the proposed data reader at step 843. Referring again to FIG. 32(A), at step 823, the proposed data reader can calculate or determine an appropriate return code based on the checksum value provided by the surgical instrument. The proposed data reader can have access to a code table and, if the proposed data reader is appropriately attempting to access the data, the appropriate return code can be available in the code table. In such instances, the proposed data reader can pull or calculate the return code at step 823 and can send the return code to the surgical instrument at step 825. Referring again to FIG. 32(C), upon receiving the return code from the proposed data reader at step 845, the surgical instrument can verify that the return code is correct at step 847. If the code is incorrect, the microprocessor of the surgical instrument can proceed to step 849 and the surgical instrument can be shut down, or access to the stored data can be otherwise denied. However, if the code is correct, the microprocessor can proceed to step 851 and the surgical instrument can provide data access to the proposed data reader. For example, the data can be securely transferred to the data reader at step 851. Thereafter, at step 827 (FIG. 32(A)), the proposed data reader can read the data from the surgical instrument. The transferred data can be encrypted and the data reader may need to decrypt the unintelligible data prior to reading it. Referring primarily to FIG. 32(B), an alternate data extraction security method can be similar to the method depicted in FIG. 32(A) and can also require the consideration of a reader-specific code. Although the reader can read the checksum of the device at step 831 and the return code can be based on the checksum, in various circumstances, the proposed data reader can have a reader-specific code, and the appropriate return code from the code table can be based on the reader-specific code. For example, the proposed data reader can consider the reader-specific code at step 832, and can determine the appropriate return code at step 833 based on the reader-specific code and the code table. The proposed data reader can provide the reader-specific code and the return code to the surgical instrument at step 835. In such instances, referring again to FIG. 32(C), the microcontroller of the surgical instrument can verify the return code and reader-specific code, at step 845. Moreover, if these codes are correct, the surgical instrument can provide access to the proposed data reader. Thereafter, at step 827, the proposed data reader can read the data from the surgical instrument. If one or both of the codes are incorrect, the surgical instrument can prevent the reader from reading the data. For example, the surgical instrument can shut down or otherwise restrict the transfer of data to the reader. Referring now to FIG. 33 a surgical system can comprise a surgical instrument 1600, which can be formed from a plurality of modular components. As described in greater detail herein, a handle component can be compatible with a plurality of different shaft components and the handle component and/or the shaft components can be reusable. Moreover, a microcontroller of the surgical instrument 1600 can include a locking circuit. The locking circuit prevents actuation of the surgical instrument until the locking circuit has been unlocked. The operator can enter a temporary access code into the surgical system to unlock the locking circuit of the microcontroller. The operator can purchase or otherwise obtain the temporary access code for entering into the surgical system. For example, the instrument manufacturer or distributor can offer access codes for sale, and such access codes can be required in order to unlock, and thus use, the surgical instrument 1660. The access code can unlock the locking circuit for a predefined period of time. The instrument manufacturer or distributor can offer different durations of use for purchase, and the user can select and purchase or acquire, a desired or preferable duration of use. For example, the user may acquire ten minutes of use, one hour of use, or one day of use. In other instances, additional and/or different suitable periods of use can be offered for sale or authorization. In various instances, after the acquired period of use expires, the locking circuit can be relocked. In other instances, an access code can unlock the locking circuit for a predefined number of surgical functions. For example, a user may purchase or otherwise obtain a single instrument firing or multiple firings. Moreover, after the user has fired the instrument the purchased or authorized number of times, the locking circuit can be relocked. In still other instances, an access code can permanently unlock the locking circuit. The operator can enter the temporary access code directly into the surgical system via a keypad or other suitable input arrangement. In other instances, the locking circuit can be unlocked by coupling a nonvolatile memory unit to the surgical instrument 1600, wherein the nonvolatile memory unit comprises a preprogrammed access code. The nonvolatile memory unit can be loaded into a battery 1650 of the surgical instrument 1660 Moreover, the nonvolatile memory unit can be reloaded and/or replaced. For example, the user can purchase replacement nonvolatile memory units. Additionally or alternatively, new codes can be purchased and uploaded to the nonvolatile memory unit after the previously-obtained access codes expire or lapse. In various instances, new codes can be loaded onto the nonvolatile memory unit when the battery 1650 is coupled to a power source and/or external computer 1670 In other instances, the temporary access code can be entered into an external or remote access code input, such as a display screen, computer, and/or heads up display. For example, a temporary access code can be purchased via a computer 1660, and can be transmitted to a radio frequency (RF) device 1680 coupled to the computer 1660. The surgical instrument 1600 can comprise a receiver or antenna, which can be in signal communication with the radio frequency device 1680 In such instances, the radio frequency device 1680 can transmit the acquired temporary access code(s) to the surgical instrument 1600 receiver. Accordingly, the locking circuit can be unlocked, and the operator can use the surgical instrument 1600 for the purchased time period and/or number of surgical functions. In various instances, a modular surgical instrument may be compatible with an external display for depicting data and/or feedback from the surgical instrument. For example, the surgical instrument can comprise an instrument display for displaying feedback from the surgical procedure. The instrument display can be positioned on the handle of the instrument. The instrument display can depict a video feed viewed from an endoscope. Additionally or alternatively, the display can detect sensed, measured, approximated, and/or calculated characteristics of the surgical instrument, surgical operation, and/or surgical site. In various instances, it may be desirable to transmit the feedback to an external display. The external display can provide an enlarged view of the duplicated and/or reproduced feedback which can allow multiple operators and/or assistants to simultaneously view the feedback. In various instances, it may be desirable to select the surgical instrument for connection to the external display and, in other instances, the selection of a surgical instrument may be automatic. Referring to FIG. 34, an external display 1700 can depict an end effector 1720 of a surgical instrument and/or the surgical site The external display 1700 can also depict feedback and/or data sensed and/or measured by the surgical instrument. The external display 1700 can duplicate feedback provided on the display of the surgical instrument. The surgical instrument can automatically connect with the external display 1700 and/or a wireless receiver in signal communication with the external, or operating room, display 1700 In such instances, an operator can be notified if multiple surgical instruments are attempting to connect to the external display 1700. As described herein, the operator can select the desired surgical instrument(s) from a menu on the external display 1700 In still other instances, the operator can select the desired surgical instrument by providing an input to the surgical instrument. For example, the operator can issue a command, control sequence, or input a code to select the surgical instrument. The operator may complete a specific control sequence with the surgical instrument to select that surgical instrument. For example, the operator may power on the surgical instrument and, within a predefined period of time, hold down the reverse button for a predefined period of time to select the surgical instrument. When an instrument is selected, the feedback on the selected instrument display can be rebroadcast or duplicated on the external display 1700 The surgical system can include a proximity sensor. For example, the external display and/or wireless receiver can comprise a proximity sensor, which can detect when a surgical instrument is brought within a predefined range thereof. Referring primarily to FIGS. 35 and 36, when the display 1700 and/or wireless receiver detect a surgical instrument, the display can notify the user. The display and/or wireless receiver may detect multiple surgical instruments. Referring to FIG. 35, the display 1700 can include a non-obtrusive notification 1704 which can communicate to the user that a surgical instrument, or multiple surgical instruments, have been detected in the proximity of the display 1700. Accordingly, using the controls for the display 1700, such as a computer the user can click the notification 1704 to open the menu 1706 of instrument selections (FIG. 122). The menu 1706 can depict the available surgical instruments, for example, and the user can select the preferred surgical instrument for broadcasting on the display 1700. For example, the menu 1706 can depict the serial numbers and/or names of the available surgical instruments. The selected surgical instrument can provide feedback to the operator to confirm its selection. For example, the selected surgical instrument can provide auditory or haptic feedback. Additionally, the selected surgical instrument can broadcast at least a portion of its feedback to the external display 1700. The operator can select multiple surgical instruments and the display 1700 can be shared by the selected surgical instruments. Additionally or alternatively, the operating room can include multiple displays and at least one surgical instrument can be selected for each display.

Additionally, it is to be appreciated that the embodiments described herein illustrate example implementations, and that the functional elements, logical blocks, modules, and circuits elements may be implemented in various other ways which are consistent with the described embodiments. Furthermore, the operations performed by such functional elements, logical blocks, modules, and circuits elements may be combined and/or separated for a given implementation and may be performed by a greater number or fewer number of components or modules. As will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading the present disclosure, each of the individual embodiments described and illustrated herein has discrete components and features which may be readily separated from or combined with the features of any of the other several aspects without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Any recited method can be carried out in the order of events recited or in any other order which is logically possible. Unless specifically stated otherwise, it may be appreciated that terms such as "processing," "computing," "calculating," "determining," or the like, refer to the action and/or processes of a computer or computing system, or similar electronic computing device, such as a general purpose processor, a DSP, ASIC, FPGA or other programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein that manipulates and/or transforms data represented as physical quantities (e.g., electronic) within registers and/or memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the memories, registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices. It is worthy of note that some embodiments may be described using the expression "coupled" and "connected" along with their derivatives. These terms are not intended as synonyms for each other. For example, some embodiments may be described using the terms "connected" and/or "coupled" to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact with each other. The term "coupled," however, also may mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other, but yet still co-operate or interact with each other. With respect to software elements the term "coupled" may refer to interfaces, message interfaces, application program interface (API), exchanging messages, and so forth. It should be appreciated that any patent, publication, or other disclosure material, in whole or in part, that is said to be incorporated by reference herein is incorporated herein only to the extent that the incorporated material does not conflict with existing definitions, statements, or other disclosure material set forth in this disclosure. As such, and to the extent necessary, the disclosure as explicitly set forth herein supersedes any conflicting material incorporated herein by reference. Any material, or portion thereof, that is said to be incorporated by reference herein, but which conflicts with existing definitions, statements, or other disclosure material set forth herein will only be incorporated to the extent that no conflict arises between that incorporated material and the existing disclosure material. The disclosed embodiments have application in conventional endoscopic and open surgical instrumentation as well as application in robotic-assisted surgery. Embodiments of the devices disclosed herein can be designed to be disposed of after a single use, or they can be designed to be used multiple times. Embodiments may, in either or both cases, be reconditioned for reuse after at least one use. Reconditioning may include any combination of the steps of disassembly of the device, followed by cleaning or replacement of particular pieces, and subsequent reassembly. In particular, embodiments of the device may be disassembled, and any number of the particular pieces or parts of the device may be selectively replaced or removed in any combination.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that reconditioning of a device may utilize a variety of techniques for disassembly, cleaning/replacement, and reassembly. Use of such techniques, and the resulting reconditioned device, are all within the scope of the present application. By way of example only, embodiments described herein may be processed before surgery. First, a new or used instrument may be obtained and when necessary cleaned. The instrument may then be sterilized. In one sterilization technique, the instrument is placed in a closed and sealed container, such as a plastic orTYVEK bag. The container and instrument may then be placed in a field of radiation that can penetrate the container, such as gamma radiation, x-rays, or high-energy electrons. The radiation may kill bacteria on the instrument and in the container. The sterilized instrument may then be stored in the sterile container. The sealed container may keep the instrument sterile until it is opened in a medical facility. A device also may be sterilized using any other technique known in the art, including but not limited to beta or gamma radiation, ethylene oxide, or steam. One skilled in the art will recognize that the herein described components (e.g., operations), devices, objects, and the discussion accompanying them are used as examples for the sake of conceptual clarity and that various configuration modifications are contemplated. Consequently, as used herein, the specific exemplars set forth and the accompanying discussion are intended to be representative of their more general classes. In general, use of any specific exemplar is intended to be representative of its class, and the non-inclusion of specific components (e.g., operations), devices, and objects should not be taken limiting. With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application. The various singular/plural permutations are not expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity. The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely examples and that in fact many other architectures may be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively "associated" such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as "associated with" each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated also can be viewed as being "operably connected," or "operably coupled," to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated also can be viewed as being "operably couplable," to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and/or physically interacting components, and/or wirelessly interactable, and/or wirelessly interacting components, and/or logically interacting, and/or logically interactable components. Some aspects may be described using the expression "coupled" and "connected" along with their derivatives. It should be understood that these terms are not intended as synonyms for each other. For example, some aspects may be described using the term "connected" to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact with each other. In another example, some aspects may be described using the term "coupled" to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact. The term "coupled," however, also may mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other, but yet still co-operate or interact with each other. In some instances, one or more components may be referred to herein as "configured to," "configurable to," "operable/operative to," "adapted/adaptable," "able to," "conformable/conformed to," etc. Those skilled in the art will recognize that "configured to" can generally encompass active-state components and/or inactive-state components and/or standby-state components, unless context requires otherwise. While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true scope of the subject matter described herein. It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as "open" terms (e.g., the term "including" should be interpreted as "including but not limited to," the term "having" should be interpreted as "having at least," the term "includes" should be interpreted as "includes but is not limited to," etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that when a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or "an" limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to claims containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or "an" (e.g., "a" and/or "an" should typically be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one or more"); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even when a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, and C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, and C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, or C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, or C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that typically a disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms unless context dictates otherwise. For example, the phrase "A or B" will be typically understood to include the possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and B." With respect to the appended claims, those skilled in the art will appreciate that recited operations therein may generally be performed in any order. Also, although various operational flows are presented in a sequence(s), it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently. Examples of such alternate orderings may include overlapping, interleaved, interrupted, reordered, incremental, preparatory, supplemental, simultaneous, reverse, or other variant orderings, unless context dictates otherwise. Furthermore, terms like "responsive to," "related to," or other past-tense adjectives are generally not intended to exclude such variants, unless context dictates otherwise. In summary, numerous benefits have been described which result from employing the concepts described herein. The foregoing description of the one or more embodiments has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or limiting to the precise form disclosed. Modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. The one or more embodiments were chosen and described in order to illustrate principles and practical application to thereby enable one of ordinary skill in the art to utilize the various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
