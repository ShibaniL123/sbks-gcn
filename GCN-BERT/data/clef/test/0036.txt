Step 2
To Compound 159 (20.0 mg, 0.037 mmol) in DMF (1 mL) solution was added potassium carbonate (10.4 mg, 0.075 mmol), the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes. Then methyl iodide (0.005 mL, 0.075 mmol) was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3.5 hours. Water (20 mL) was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (20 mL) and saturated brine (20 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration, the residue was dissolved (20.0 mg) in ethanol (1 mL), and 2 mol/L aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (0.500 mL, 1.00 mmol) was added thereto, and then the mixture was stirred under reflux for 1.5 hours. 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid (1.5 mL) and saturated brine (20 mL) were added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After concentration, the residue was purified by HPLC (0.1% formic acid in water - 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) to obtain Compound I-219 (2.6 mg, 13% yield).
