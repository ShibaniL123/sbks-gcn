TITLE MONOLITHIC MEDICAL DEVICES, METHODS OF MAKING AND USING THE SAME BACKGROUND [001] The invention generally relates to medical devices. [002] Various types of intravascular stents have been used in recent years. An intravascular stent generally refers to a device used for the support of living tissue during the healing phase, including the support of internal structures. Intravascular stents, or stents, placed intraluminally, as by use of a catheter device, have been demonstrated to be highly efficacious in initially restoring patency to sites of vascular occlusion. Intravascular stents, or stents, may be of the balloon-expandable type, such as those of U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,733,665; 5,102,417; or 5,195,984, which are distributed by Johnson & Johnson Interventional Systems, of Warren, N.J., as the Palmaz™ and the Palmaz-Schatz™ balloon-expandable stents or balloon expandable stents of other manufacturers, as are known in the art. Other types of intravascular stents are known as self-expanding stents, such as Nitinol coil stents or self-expanding stents made of stainless steel wire formed into a zigzag tubular configuration. [003] Prior art stents have some functional limitations due to their current design. For example, the prior art stent can collapse when it is bent around a sharp angle. What is needed is an improved stent that is more flexible and can be implanted in tightly bent vessels. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [004] Provided herein are systems, methods and compositions for monolithic medical devices and methods making and using the same. [005] The methods, systems, and apparatuses are set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or can be learned by practice of the methods, apparatuses, and systems.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [027] The foregoing and other features and advantages of the invention are apparent from the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments, read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. The detailed description and drawings are merely illustrative of the invention rather than limiting, the scope of the invention being defined by the appended claims and equivalents thereof. [028] In one aspect, the present invention comprises a monolithic medical device and a method of making monolithic medical devices. [029] Generally speaking, the monolithic device may comprise a covered stent 300, as shown in FIG. 3Α. In one embodiment, the monolithic device can be used to prevent plaque from embolizing downstream during a stent placement. The covered (or webbed) stent 300 comprises of a plurality of scaffolding members 310 and a mesh patterned members 320 webbed between the scaffolding members 310. The mesh patterned member 320 webbed between the scaffolding members 310 surround a lumen 302 and may generally expand from a contracted state to an expanded state. The scaffold members 310 may generally for polygonal shapes, including, but not limited to, squares, rectangles, trapezoids, pentagons, diamond-shapes, hexagons, octagons, circles, ellipses, and the like. The mesh patterned member 320 may general includes a plurality of openings 330 traversing the thickness of the mesh patterned member 320. The mesh patterned members 320 includes a surface on which a pattern of openings 330 is formed. The covered stent 300 can be monolithically constructed out of one starting work-piece tube using subtractive processing. The covered stent made monolithically is favored due the fact that the tedious and often questionable joining/assembly of the two components as historically achieved could possibly be circumvented, in-tum potentially improving quality and performance while reducing overall costs. The monolithically constructed covered stent ensures a secure bond between the scaffolding members 310 and the mesh patterned member 320 webbed between the scaffolding members 310 about the entire length and circumference of the device. [030] FIG. 1 highlights the process flow steps 100 of how the monolithic covered stent may be made according to one embodiment. A start tube is prepared 105, and then photoresist is applied to the start tube 110. The start tube may be a wrought metal, polymer, composite, or ceramic tube, or may be vacuum deposited metal or polymer tube. The start tube may be fabricated by a deposition procedure as disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application serial no. 13/788,081, filed March 7, 2013 or in U.S. Patent Application serial no. 13/099,980, filed 5/3/2011, herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. Alternatively, the monolithic device may be produced from drawn metal or polymer tubing, or wrought tubing, provided that fatigue life is adequate. Radiopaque markers could be added as an interdispersed deposited layer or a ternary alloy deposition (e.g., NiTiTa or NiTiNb) if vacuum deposition is used. Different metal layers may be used to form the monolithic device. The positioning of the layers can be optimized for mechanical, or other reasons. Furthermore, ternary additions to binary Nitinol can be used to strengthen or otherwise alter the material properties, allowing for lower profile devices, enhanced fatigue resistance, etc. These ternary additions can also double as radiopacity enhancers. The stent pattern is then exposed 115 and the stent pattern’s exposed photoresist is developed 120. Methods for UV exposure of the pattern (stent or mesh) can include using contact mask methods, non-contact methods (e.g., DLP pattern projection), or UV laser writing. Then the stent pattern is chemically machined 125, and the photoresist is removed 130. Photoresist is then reapplied 135, and the mesh pattern is exposed 140. The exposed photoresist for the mesh pattern members is developed 142, and the mesh pattern members are chemically machined 144. The final step is to remove the photoresist 146. Photo-chemical machining enables the tiered levels of tube wall material from which the stent scaffold and fine mesh patterned members can be made. Steps 105 through 130 shown in Figure 1 detail how the larger scaffolding patterns of a stent may be chemically machined to achieve a partial through-wall pattern. It is preferred that the photoresist be coated electro-phoretically due to the nature of the coating process that results in uniform and even conformal coatings over complex 3D work-piece geometries. Steps 135 through 146 highlight methods for machining the fine mesh pattem(s) within the cells of the larger stent struts either by using photo-chemical or laser machining. The machining and patterning herewith may use the methods of commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 13/801,173, filed March 13, 2013, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Alternatively, the mesh pattern members may include grooved features along with the openings on at least one surface of the monolithic device. In other embodiments, the pattern may be a plurality of microgrooves imparted onto the luminal and/or abluminal surface of the monolithic device, as is more fully described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 13/654,923, filed October 18, 2012, which is commonly assigned with the present application and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The plurality of microgrooves may be formed either as a post-deposition process step, such as by etching, or during deposition, such as by depositing the stent-forming material onto a mandrel which has a microtopography on the surface thereof which causes the metal to deposit with the microgroove pattern as part of the deposited material. [031] An alternative process 200 is shown in FIG. 2, which comprises the preparation of the start tube 205, and applying a photoresist to the start tube 210. Then, the stent pattern is exposed 215 and the photoresist is developed for the stent pattern 220. The stent pattern is then chemically machined 225, and the photoresist is removed 230. The last step is to laser machine the mesh pattern 240. [032] The processes 100 and 200 previously mentioned include the use of electrophoretically depositable (ED) photoresist, and photochemical machining of a 3D work-piece geometry to make the monolithic medical device. The use of ED photoresist allows for pattern designs that encompass different circumferential planes, which is necessary for the monolithic covered stent to resolve the stent and mesh patterns. Through the methods 100 and 200 disclosed above, a vast assortment of stent and mesh patterns may be formed which enable optimal designs. [033] Although it is preferable that the photoresist be applied to the work-piece tube (or other geometry) electrophoretically using either an anionic or cationic electrophoretic depositable photoresist, the photoresist may be applied using other techniques including but not limited to lamination, spraying, dipping, or Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). Although chemical machining has been initially disclosed as the method for through-resist machining, other selective methods including but not limited to reactive ion etching (RIE), dry etching, electrochemical machining, or photo-activated chemical machining may be used. RIE may utilize Cl or F (or mixtures thereof) based chemistries or others compatible with etching SS, PtCr, Nitinol, SS, CoCr alloys (to include ΜΡ35Ν and L-605). Dry etching may use inert gases such as Ar, Kr, Xe, and the like. [034] As shown in FIG. 3Β, the device 300 includes a plurality of scaffold members 310 and mesh patterned members 320 webbed between the scaffolding members 310. The scaffolding members 310 may include a raised surface feature that includes a thickness Τ above the surface of the mesh patterned members 320. The mesh patterned members 320 may form generally polygonal shapes with the scaffolding members 310 forming the borders thereabout. A plurality of openings 330 may be patterned in a first row 332, a second row 334, and/or a third row 336 in the mesh patterned members 320. The scaffolding members 310 may intersect at points 312 to form larger hinge regions 312 to allow for the expansion of the scaffolding members 310. In one embodiment, the mesh patterned members 320 have a length or a width between at least 0.1 to 50.0 microns in length or width, alternatively between at least 10.0 to 100.0 microns in length or width, or alternatively between at least 1.0 to 1000.0 microns in length or width. The length and/or width of the mesh patterned members 320 may be selected according to the type of pattern and openings employed with the mesh patterned members. [035] An alternative embodiment of the monolithic medical device 400 is shown in FIGS. 4Α-4Β. The monolithic medical device 400 comprises a plurality of scaffold members 410 interconnected by a plurality of mesh patterned members 420. The mesh patterned members 420 may include a plurality of openings 430 throughout the surface of the mesh patterned members 420, and exterior borders 422 around the perimeters of the mesh patterned members 420, as shown in FIG. 4Β. The plurality of openings 430 may generally form a diamond shaped pattern 432. The generally diamond shaped pattern 432 may generally include between at least 4 to 16 openings 430 in a mesh patterned member 420. Generally, the scaffold members 410 include a thickness Τ that is raised from the surface of the mesh patterned members 420, and the scaffold members 410 intersect at hinge regions 412. [036] An alternative embodiment of the monolithic medical device 500 is shown in FIGS. 5Α-5Β. The monolithic medical device 500 may comprise a plurality of scaffold members 510 interconnected by a plurality of mesh patterned members 520. The mesh patterned members 520 may include a plurality of openings 530 in the comer features of the mesh patterned members 520, and a plurality of L-shaped openings 532 traversing the width and length of the mesh patterned members 520. In one embodiment, each comer opening 530 includes at least 2 to 5 L-shaped openings 532 of progressively larger L-shapes. As shown in FIG. 5Β, comer openings 530 adjacent to scaffold members 510 may be a different size. Generally, the scaffold members 510 include a thickness Τ that is raised from the surface of the mesh patterned members 520, and the scaffold members 510 intersect at hinge regions 512. [037] As shown in FIGS. 6Α-6Β, the photoresist and the exposed metal from the metal tube 600 are shown after steps 105 through 120 and steps 205 through 220. The exposed photoresist 610 defines the location of the scaffold members and the exposed metal 620 is shown for locations of the mesh pattern members. FIG. 6C shows the result of steps 125 through 130 and steps 225 through 230, displaying the scaffold members 630 and mesh pattern surface 640 that can be later patterned by laser machining or chemical machining. [038] The monolithic device may be used with any type of cell, which cell has a cellular membrane. Most distinct cell types arise from a single totipotent cell that differentiates into hundreds of different cell types during the course of development. Multicellular organisms are composed of cells that fall into two fundamental types: germ cells and somatic cells. During development, somatic cells will become more specialized and form the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. After formation of the three germ layers, cells will continue to specialize until they reach a terminally differentiated state that is much more resistant to changes in cell type than its progenitors. The ectoderm differentiates to form the nervous system (spine, peripheral nerves and brain), tooth enamel and the epidermis (the outer part of integument). It also forms the lining of mouth, anus, nostrils, sweat glands, hair and nails. The endoderm forms the gastrointestinal tract cells, the respiratory tract cells, the endocrine glands and organ cells, the auditory system cells, and the urinary system cells. The mesoderm forms mesenchyme (connective tissue), mesothelium, non-epithelial blood cells and coelomocytes. Mesothelium lines coeloms; forms the muscles, septa (cross-wise partitions) and mesenteries (length-wise partitions); and forms part of the gonads (the rest being the gametes). [039] The inventive monolithic devices may be intravascular stents, stent-grafts, grafts, heart valves, venous valves, filters, occlusion devices, catheters, sheaths, osteal implants, implantable contraceptives, implantable antitumor pellets or rods, shunts and patches, pacemakers, needles, temporary fixation rods, medical wires or medical tubes for any type of medical device, or other implantable medical devices, as will also be hereinafter described. A pacemaker (or artificial pacemaker, so as not to be confused with the heart's natural pacemaker) is a medical device that uses electrical impulses, delivered by electrodes contacting the heart muscles, to regulate the beating of the heart. The electrodes may be covered by tubing or other material that includes a surface that may require endothelialization and grooves thereon. Earrings and other piercings may benefit from the topographical features, as well as any other implant, whether the implant is an organic, inorganic, mechanical, electrical, or biological device. [040] In some embodiments, such as those discussed above in relation to FIGS. 1-6C the monolithic device is formed from a metal, a polymer, a composite, or a ceramic material. In some embodiments, materials to make the inventive stents are chosen for their biocompatibility, mechanical properties, i.e., tensile strength, yield strength, and their ease of deposition include the following: elemental titanium, vanadium, aluminum, nickel, tantalum, zirconium, chromium, silver, gold, silicon, magnesium, niobium, scandium, platinum, cobalt, palladium, manganese, molybdenum and alloys thereof, such as zirconium-titanium-tantalum alloys, nitinol, and stainless steel. [041] In another aspect, the present invention may comprise a monolithic medical device and a method of using the monolithic medical device. [042] Generally speaking, the monolithic device 700 may comprise a low profile stent that promotes thrombosis of an aneurysm 12 by diverting blood flow through the parent vessel 10, as shown in FIG. 7. As shown in FIG. 8Α, the monolithic device 700 comprises an ultra-dense stent cell pattern 710 including a plurality of structural members 720 that diverts the majority of blood flow without restricting blood flow completely, thus providing the opportunity for the aneurysm to shrink over time. The monolithic device includes an expanded state and a contracted state for delivery. The monolithic device may include an end ring 730 on the proximal and/or distal ends. This monolithic device may alternatively be used as an embolic protection stent cover or in any other application where a low profile, high density pattern is desirable. Alternatively, the monolithic device may be used a liner for a catheter tip, scaffold/indenter for drug-eluting balloons, and vascular stenting, including; vulnerable plaque containment (carotid, coronary), flow diversion, adjunct to coiling (neurological), and vascular perforation. [043] As shown in FIG. 8Β, the expanded monolithic device 700 includes the end ring 730 on either the proximal or distal end or both ends of the device 700. The ultra-dense cell pattern 710 includes a first Z-pattem 740 of the structural members 720 and a second Z-pattem 742 of the structural members 720. The structural members 720 of the first and second Z-pattems 740, 742 form a plurality of peaks 744 and a plurality of troughs 746 along the longitudinal axis 702 of the monolithic device 700. The first and second Z-pattems 740, 742 are interconnected by a plurality of curved interconnecting members 750 that connect a peak 744 of the first Ζ pattern 740 with a trough 746 of the second Ζ pattern 742. Preferably, the curved interconnecting members 750 do not connect adjacent peaks 744 of the first Ζ pattern to adjacent troughs 746 of the second Ζ pattern. In one embodiment, the curved interconnecting members 750 connect a peak 744 of the first Ζ pattern with a trough 746 of the second Ζ pattern that is displaced along the longitudinal axis and at least one trough below the peak 744 along the vertical axis 704 of the monolithic device 700. In other embodiments, the curved interconnecting members 750 may connect a peak 744 of the first Ζ pattern 740 with a trough 746 of the second Ζ pattern 742 that is at least two troughs below the peak 744 along the vertical axis 704 of the monolithic device. This connection of the peak 744 of the first Ζ pattern 740 with a nonadjacent trough 746 of the second Ζ pattern 742 by the curved interconnecting member 750 forms the curved portion of the curved interconnecting member 750. As shown in FIGS. 8B-8C, the second Ζ pattern 742 is connected with a second set of curved interconnecting members 752 at the peak 744 that is angled at an opposite angle or non-parallel angle from the first set of the curved interconnecting members 750. The opposite or non-parallel angle may be between about 10-100 degrees, alternatively, between about 20-90 degrees, alternatively, between about 30-80 degrees. The tight first and second Ζ patterns 740, 742 allow the monolithic device to maintain adequate radial force despite its small size. The interior cell structure 710 could be modified to optimize performance. In some embodiments, the monolithic device 700 may include a radiopaque layer, as more fully discussed below. [044] As shown in FIGS. 8B-8D, the end ring 730 includes an end Ζ pattern 732 comprising a plurality of peaks 734 and a plurality of troughs 736. In one embodiment, a peak 734 of the end ring 730 connects to every other trough 746 of the first Ζ pattern 740, such that the peak 734 of each end Ζ pattern 730 does not connect to adjacent troughs 746 of the first Ζ pattern 740. This connection forms a larger end Ζ pattern 732. In one embodiment, the peak 734 of the end Ζ pattern 732 connects to every third trough 746 of the first Ζ pattern 740, while in other embodiments the peak 734 may connect to every fourth trough 746 of the first Ζ pattern 740. The modified end rings of the stent geometry can prevent cell migration as well as be used for marker placement. Alternatively, the end rings could be modified or eliminated completely from the monolithic device. [045] As shown in FIG. 9, the monolithic device 700 may be bent along its longitudinal axis to conform to the shape or curvature of a blood vessel. After being deployment and bending along its longitudinal axis, the monolithic device 700 is retrievable. The spacing between the curved interconnecting members 750 and 752 is maintained between about least 0.1 and 20 microns, and the spacing between the peaks 744 and the troughs 746 of the first and second Ζ patterns 740, 742 is maintained between about at least 0.1 and 20 microns to permit blood flow therebetween. The monolithic device 700 is able to bend, while the wall thickness of the monolithic device 700 is between about 0.1-100.0 microns. [046] As shown in FIG. 10, the monolithic device 700 may be crimped around a guide wire 790. The crimping may collapse the first Ζ pattern 740, the end ring 730, and the curved interconnecting members 750 to a diameter between about 0.2 and 2.0 mm. After the monolithic device 700 is uncrimped, the monolithic device 700 may expand to a diameter between about 2.0 and 7.0 mm while maintaining adequate radial force and wall apposition. In one embodiment, the wall thickness of the monolithic device 700 is less than about 75 microns. [047] An alternative embodiment of the monolithic device is shown in FIGS. 11A-11C. The monolithic device 800 comprises a dense cell pattern 810 and may include a first Ζ pattern 840, a second Ζ pattern 842, and a plurality of looped interconnecting members 850 connecting the first Ζ pattern 840 and the second Ζ pattern 842. The proximal and/or distal end of the monolithic device 800 may include an end ring 830 in an end Ζ pattern 832 that is connected to the first Ζ pattern 840. The first and second Ζ patterns 840, 842 include a plurality of interconnected peaks 844 and troughs 846. As shown in FIG. 11Β, the peak 844 of the first Ζ pattern 840 is connected to the first end 852 of the looped interconnecting member 850, whereby the first end 852 of the looped interconnected member 850 forms a generally first loop 854 facing the proximal end of the monolithic device 800, while the first loop 854 connects to a second loop 856 that faces in the opposite direction of the first loop 854 and towards the distal end of the monolithic device. The second loop 856 ends at the second end 858 that is connected to the trough 846 of the second Ζ pattern 842. In one embodiment, the first loop 854 fits within the peak 844 of the second Ζ pattern 844, and the second loop 856 fits within the trough 846 of the first Ζ pattern 840. As shown in FIG. 11C, the end ring 830 includes an end Ζ pattern 832, which includes a plurality of interconnected peaks 834 and troughs 836. The peak 834 of the end Ζ pattern 832 connects with the trough 846 of the first Ζ pattern 840, and in one embodiment, the peak 834 of the end Ζ pattern 832 connects with every other trough 846 of the first Ζ pattern 840, or every third trough 846 of the first Ζ pattern 840. Optionally, the end Ζ pattern 832 may include additional peaks 834b and troughs 836b, whereby the peaks 834b are to the troughs 836, as to further extend the distal end. A radiopaque layer 860 of Tantalum may be between two layers of metal for the monolithic device 800. The Tantalum is the white layer 860 that appears as a stripe along the side walls of the stent, as shown in FIG. 11Β. Alternatively, radiopaque layer 860 may comprise another biocompatible radiopaque material. [048] The monolithic device 800 may have a wall thickness between about 0.1-100.0 microns. The monolithic device 800 may be crimped around a guide wire. The crimping may collapse the first Z-pattem, the end ring, and the looped interconnecting members to a diameter between about 0.2 and 2.0 mm. After the monolithic device 800 is uncrimped, the monolithic device 800 may expand to a diameter between about 2.0 and 7.0 mm while maintaining adequate radial force and wall apposition. In one embodiment, the wall thickness of the monolithic device 800 is less than about 75 microns. [049] In some embodiments, such as those discussed above in relation to FIGS. 7-11C, the monolithic device is formed from a material that is a metal, a polymer, a composite, or a ceramic material. In some embodiments, materials to make the inventive stents are chosen for their biocompatibility, mechanical properties, i.e., tensile strength, yield strength, and their ease of deposition include the following: elemental titanium, vanadium, aluminum, nickel, tantalum, zirconium, chromium, silver, gold, silicon, magnesium, niobium, scandium, platinum, cobalt, palladium, manganese, molybdenum and alloys thereof, such as zirconium-titanium-tantalum alloys, nitinol, and stainless steel. [050] In some embodiments, the monolithic device 700 may be fabricated by a procedure, as described in U.S. Application serial no. 13/788,081, filed March 7, 2013 or in U.S. Patent Application serial no. 13/099,980, filed 5/3/2011, herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. In one embodiment, a coating of deposited metal film or polymer is about 0.1 - 100.0 microns in a tube form, which is laser cut using ultra short pulsed femtosecond laser to minimize heat affected zones and recast. The final monolithic device may be heat treated to optimize spring back effects. The stent's one piece construction allows many advantages over many currently available braided stent designs, such as a lower profile, self-expanding, and ease of manufacturing. Alternatively, the monolithic device may be produced from drawn metal or polymer tubing, wrought tubing, provided that fatigue life is adequate. Radiopaque markers could be added as an interdispersed deposited layer if vacuum deposition is used. Different metal layers may be used to form the monolithic device. [051] In some embodiments, the method further comprises the step of patterning at least one surface of the monolithic device. In some embodiments, the patterning comprises laser patterning to impart at least one feature on the at least one surface of the monolithic device. In some embodiments, the pattern is a series of grooves on at least one surface of the monolithic device, preferably the surface that will comprise the inner diameter of the finished stent. In other embodiments, the pattern may be a plurality of microgrooves imparted onto the luminal and/or abluminal surface of the monolithic device, as is more fully described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 13/654,923, filed October 18, 2012, which is commonly assigned with the present application and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The plurality of microgrooves may be formed either as a post-deposition process step, such as by etching, or during deposition, such as by depositing the stent-forming material onto a mandrel which has a microtopography on the surface thereof which causes the metal to deposit with the microgroove pattern as part of the deposited material. [052] The inventive monolithic devices may be intravascular stents, stent-grafts, grafts, heart valves, venous valves, filters, occlusion devices, catheters, sheaths, osteal implants, implantable contraceptives, implantable antitumor pellets or rods, shunts and patches, pacemakers, needles, temporary fixation rods, medical wires or medical tubes for any type of medical device, or other implantable medical devices, as will also be hereinafter described. A pacemaker (or artificial pacemaker, so as not to be confused with the heart's natural pacemaker) is a medical device that uses electrical impulses, delivered by electrodes contacting the heart muscles, to regulate the beating of the heart. The electrodes may be covered by tubing or other material that includes a surface that may require endothelialization and grooves thereon. Earrings and other piercings may benefit from the topographical features, as well as any other implant, whether the implant is an organic, inorganic, mechanical, electrical, or biological device. [053] The monolithic device may be used with any type of cell, which cell has a cellular membrane. Most distinct cell types arise from a single totipotent cell that differentiates into hundreds of different cell types during the course of development. Multicellular organisms are composed of cells that fall into two fundamental types: germ cells and somatic cells. During development, somatic cells will become more specialized and form the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. After formation of the three germ layers, cells will continue to specialize until they reach a terminally differentiated state that is much more resistant to changes in cell type than its progenitors. The ectoderm differentiates to form the nervous system (spine, peripheral nerves and brain), tooth enamel and the epidermis (the outer part of integument). It also forms the lining of mouth, anus, nostrils, sweat glands, hair and nails. The endoderm forms the gastrointestinal tract cells, the respiratory tract cells, the endocrine glands and organ cells, the auditory system cells, and the urinary system cells. The mesoderm forms mesenchyme (connective tissue), mesothelium, non-epithelial blood cells and coelomocytes. Mesothelium lines coeloms; forms the muscles, septa (cross-wise partitions) and mesenteries (length-wise partitions); and forms part of the gonads (the rest being the gametes).
