FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to phosphor compositions, particularly phosphors for use in fluorescent lamps. More particularly, the present invention relates to improving the efficacy of a fluorescent lamp by providing an optimized blend of four or more phosphors for use therein. BACKGROUND Fluorescent lamps typically have a transparent glass envelope enclosing a sealed discharge space containing an inert gas and mercury vapor. When subjected to a current provided by electrodes, the mercury ionizes to produce radiation having primary wavelengths of 185 nm and 254 nm. This ultraviolet radiation, in turn, excites phosphors on the inside surface of the envelope to produce visible light which is emitted through the glass. Generally, a fluorescent lamp for illumination uses a phosphor which absorbs the 254 nm Hg-resonance wave; the phosphor is activated so as to convert ultraviolet light into visible light. In order to improve the color-rendering properties and emission output of fluorescent lamps, efficient illumination of a white color has been recently provided using a three-band type fluorescent lamp which employs a mixture of red, green and blue-emitting phosphors. In such a three-band type phosphor lamp, the emitting colors of the respective phosphors are considerably different from one another. Therefore, if the emitting intensity of any of the three corresponding phosphors is decreased, color deviation occurs, degrading the color-rendering properties of the lamp. For example, LaPO4:Ce3+,Tb3+ (LAP) has been typically used as a green phosphor in combination with other phosphors (i.e., a red and blue phosphor). However, LAP is relatively expensive and can greatly increase the cost of the lamp. Thus, a need exists for a phosphor blend that better matches the eye sensitivity curve, especially while avoiding the use of LAP in the lamp in order to reduce costs. US 2008/0191601 discloses a fluorescent lamp comprising a glass envelope coated with one or more phosphor containing layers and filled with a gas, said fluorescent lamp further comprising means capable of discharging said gas. The composition of said phosphor containing layer is tailored to obtain a special color rendering index higher than 93 for at least printing primary colors cyan, magenta and yellow. The lamp is particularly suitable for inspection of color-printed matter in the graphical industry. WO 2011/0154691 discloses a luminophore composition for low pressure discharge lamps for generating radiation with a color temperature of great than 4800 K having a very good general color rendering index of greater than 90, the luminophore composition including at least one halophosphate luminophore, a luminophore emitting in the red wavelength region, a luminophore emitting in the blue-green wavelength region, a europium-doped luminophore emitting in the blue wavelength region and a Tb-doped luminophore emitting in the green wavelength region, wherein the luminophore composition includes a luminophore emitting in an emission range in the visible region with wavelengths of great than 380 nm and at least one emission band in the near ultraviolet and that the emitted intensity of the luminophore is smaller in the visible region than in the near ultraviolet region. US 5854533 discloses a fluorescent lamp comprising a metameric mixture of a plurality of blends of lamp phosphors for converting ultraviolet radiation to visible illumination, each of said blends of lamp phosphors having a different Spectral Power Distribution and substantially identical color coordinates, the color rendering index (CRI) of said metameric mixture being higher than the CRI of each of said blends of lamp phosphors.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Reference will now be made in detail to present embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The detailed description uses numerical and letter designations to refer to features in the drawings. Like or similar designations in the drawings and description have been used to refer to like or similar parts of embodiments of the invention. As used herein, a "fluorescent lamp" is any mercury vapor discharge fluorescent lamp as known in the art, including fluorescent lamps wherein the discharge generator can include having electrodes, and electrode-less fluorescent lamps wherein the discharge generator includes a radio transmitter adapted to excite mercury vapor atoms via transmission of an electromagnetic signal. Referring to FIG. 1, there is depicted a representative mercury vapor discharge fluorescent lamp 10 comprising an elongated light-transmissive glass tube or envelope 12 (e.g., a soda-lime silicate glass envelope) having a circular cross-section. The low pressure mercury discharge assembly in said lamp includes a pair of spaced conventional electrode structures 18 at each end connected to electrical contacts 22 of a base 20 fixed at both ends of the sealed glass envelope 12. The discharge-sustaining filling in said sealed glass envelope is an inert gas such as argon or a mixture of argon and other inert gases at a low pressure in combination with a small quantity of mercury to provide the low vapor pressure manner of lamp operation. For example, a discharge-sustaining fill gas of mercury and an inert gas can be sealed in the interior volume inside the glass tube 12. The inert gas desirably is argon or a mixture of argon and krypton, but could be some other inert gas or mixture of inert gases. The inert gas and a small quantity of mercury vapor provide the low vapor pressure manner of operation. Preferably, the mercury vapor has a pressure in the range of 4 to 6 millitorr. Disposed on the inner surface of the glass envelope is a phosphor layer comprising a phosphor blend, as described below. As used herein, "disposed" on an inner surface can refer to the phosphor layer being directly on the envelope, or on at least one other layer(s) which are on the envelope. In one embodiment of the invention, the lamp 10 may have a second layer 14 positioned between the phosphor blend layer 16 and the inner surface of the glass envelope 12. This second layer 14 can be, for instance, an ultraviolet reflecting barrier layer as is known in the art. Such a barrier layer can comprise, for example, alpha-alumina particles and/or gamma-alumina particles. The phosphor layer 16 generally includes a phosphor blend of at least one of each of a calcium halophosphor, a blue phosphor having an broad-spectrum emission peak at about 440 nm to about 490 nm (e.g., about 440 nm to about 460 nm), a blue-green phosphor having an emission peak at about 475 nm to about 530 nm (e.g., about 480 nm to about 525 nm), and a red phosphor having an emission peak at about 600 nm to about 650 nm (e.g., about 605 nm to about 625 nm). The phosphor blend is substantially free from other phosphors (i.e., those other phosphors not falling into one of the four phosphor types of calcium halophosphor, blue phosphor, blue-green phosphor, or red phosphor), including in particular LaPO4:Ce3+,Tb3+. As used herein, the term "substantially free" means no more than an insignificant trace amount present and encompasses completely free (e.g., 0 wt. % up to 0.01 wt. %). Calcium halophosphors are generally non-rare earth phosphors that include a halogen (e.g., Cl, F, Br) or a combination of halogens. Particularly suitable calcium halophosphors include fluorapatite (Ca10(PO4)6F2), chlorapatite (Ca10(PO4)6Cl2), and bromapatite (Ca10(PO4)6Br2) or a combination thereof (generally, Ca10(PO4)6(F,Cl,Br)2) doped with antimony (Sb) and/or manganese (Mn). For example, one particularly suitable calcium halophosphor can be Ca10(PO4)6(F,Cl)2:Sb, Mn. The phosphors suitable for use in the embodiments of the present invention include any that are capable of absorbing ultraviolet light and emitting light in the stated region (i.e., blue, blue-green, and red). Although not intended to be limiting, examples of suitable phosphors of each type are listed below. For example, suitable blue phosphors include, but are not limited to, (Ba,Sr,Ca)5(PO4)3(Cl,F,OH):Eu2+, Mn2+, Sb3+; (Ba,Sr,Ca)MgAl10O17:Eu2+,Mn2+; (Ba,Sr,Ca)BPO5:Eu2+, Mn2+; (Sr,Ba)MgAl10O17:Eu2+; (Sr,Ca,Ba)5(PO4)4Cl:Eu2+; (Ba,Ca)5(PO4)3Cl:Eu2+, or a combination thereof. Suitable blue-green phosphors include, but are not limited to, Sr4Al14O25:Eu2+; BaAl8O13:Eu2+; 2SrO-0.84P2O5-0.16B2O3:Eu2+; MgWO4; BaTiP2O8; (Ba,Sr,Ca)MgAl10O17:Eu2+,Mn2+; (Ba,Sr,Ca)5(PO4)3(Cl,F,OH):Eu2+,Mn2+, Sb3+; or combinations thereof. Suitable red phosphors include, but are not limited to, (Y,Gd,La,Lu,Sc)2O3:Eu3+; (Y,Gd,La,In,Lu,Sc)BO3:Eu3+; (Y,Gd,La)(Al,Ga)O3:Eu3+; (Ba,Sr,Ca)(Y,Gd,La,Lu)2O4:Eu3+; (Y,Gd)Al3B4O12:Eu3+; monoclinic Gd2O3:Eu3+; (Gd,Y)4(Al,Ga)2O9:Eu3+; (Ca,Sr)(Gd,Y)3(Ge,Si)Al3O9:Eu3+; Y(V,P)O4:Eu3+; (Y,Gd,La,Lu)3GaO6:Eu3+; (Sr,Mg)3(PO4)2:Sn2+; 3.5MgO-0.5MgF2-GeO2:Mn4+; GdMgB5O10:Ce3+,Mn2+, or combinations thereof. In one particular embodiment, the calcium halophosphor can be Ca10(PO4)6(F,Cl)2:Sb, Mn, the blue phosphor can be barium magnesium aluminate activated by europium (BAM), the blue-green phosphor can be barium magnesium aluminate activated by europium and manganese (BAMn), and the red phosphor can be yttrium oxide activated by europium (YEO). For example, the phosphor blend can be (e.g., can consist essentially of or can consist of) a combination of [Ca10(PO4)6(F,Cl)2:Sb, Mn], barium magnesium aluminate activated by europium, barium magnesium aluminate activated by europium and manganese, and yttrium oxide activated by europium. In one particular embodiment, the phosphor blend may generally contain about 0.1 wt. % to about 10 wt. % of the blue phosphor, about 1 wt. % to about 20 wt. % of the blue-green phosphor, about 20 wt. % to about 45 wt. % of the red phosphor, and about 20 wt. % to about 60 wt. % of the calcium halophosphor in terms of the total weight of phosphors in the phosphor layer. For example, the phosphor blend may generally contain about 1 wt. % to about 5 wt. % of the blue phosphor, about 10 wt. % to about 18 wt. % of the blue-green phosphor, about 30 wt. % to about 35 wt. % of the red phosphor, and/or about 40 wt. % to about 55 wt. % of the calcium halophosphor in terms of the total weight of the phosphors in the phosphor layer. As used herein, the term wt. % (i.e., weight percent) is calculated by dividing the total weight of the dried component by the total weight of the dried layer, multiplied by 100. Thus, the sum of the wt. percent of all the phosphor components in the phosphor blend will be 100%. If other components (binders, etc,) are present in the phosphor blend, such other components are generally not phosphors. However, the relative proportions of the individual phosphors in the phosphor blend may be adjusted such that when their emissions are blended, there is produced visible light of predetermined x and y values of CIE coordinates wherein the x value may be in the range of about 0.25 to about 0.46 (e.g., 0.30 to about 0.40), and said y value may be in the range of about 0.30 to about 0.42. Additionally, the relative proportions of the components are such that the resulting light exhibits an increased luminous efficacy as compared to a tri-component blend formed from a tri-phosphor component blend consisting of one each of a conventional green, red and blue phosphor. The above-described inventive combination of phosphors can result in increased luminosity over conventional tri-phosphor blends due to their increased emission in the spectral regions in which the eye is particularly sensitive. The color correlated temperature (CCT) of the blend can range from about 2500-10000 K, depending on the identity and exact mass fraction of each phosphor in the system. As used herein, the terms "luminosity" and "luminous efficacy" are synonymous. The apparent color of a light source is described in terms of color temperature, which is the temperature of a black body that emits radiation of about the same chromaticity as the radiation considered. A light source having a color temperature of 3000 Kelvin has a larger red component than a light source having a color temperature of 4100 Kelvin. The color temperature of a lamp using a phosphor blend can be varied by changing the ratio of the phosphors. Color quality is further described in terms of color rendering, and more particularly color rendering index (CRI or Ra), which is a measure of the degree to which the psycho-physical colors of objects illuminated by a light source conform to those of a reference illuminant for specified conditions. CRI is in effect a measure of how well the spectral distribution of a light source compares with that of an incandescent (blackbody) source, which has a Planckian distribution between the infrared (over 700 nm) and the ultraviolet (under 400 nm). The discrete spectra which characterize phosphor blends will yield good color rendering of objects whose colors match the spectral peaks, but not as good of objects whose colors lie between the spectral peaks. The color appearance of a lamp is described by its chromaticity coordinates which can be calculated from the spectral power distribution according to standard methods. See CIE, Method of measuring and specifying color rendering properties of light sources (2nd ed.), Publ. CIE No. 13.2 (TC-3, 2), Bureau Central de la CIE, Paris, 1974. The CIE standard chromaticity diagram includes the color points of black body radiators at various temperatures. The locus of black body chromaticities on the x,y-diagram is known as the Planckian locus. Any emitting source represented by a point on this locus may be specified by a color temperature. A point near but not on this Planckian locus has a correlated color temperature (CCT) because lines can be drawn from such points to intersect the Planckian locus at this color temperature such that all points look to the average human eye as having nearly the same color. Luminous efficacy of a source of light is the quotient of the total luminous flux emitted by the total lamp power input as expressed in lumens per watt (LPW or lm/W). In one embodiment of the present invention, a phosphor blend for use in a light source having a color rendering index of at least 85 resulting in improved luminosity over conventional tri-phosphor blends for a given color temperature is provided, such as at least 87 (e.g., about 88 to about 90). The phosphor layers discussed above can be formed by any effective method, including some known procedures including deposition from liquid suspensions and electrostatic deposition. For example, the phosphor can be deposited on the glass surface from a conventional aqueous suspension including various organic binders and adherence promoting agents. Said aqueous suspension is applied and then dried in the conventional manner. The phosphors for use in the present invention may be made by any effective method, including some conventional methods including a ceramic powder method, a liquid phase (flux) method, or a solid state method. Additional additives may be included in the phosphor blend and can include a dispersion vehicle, binder and one or more of various known non-luminescent additives, including, e.g., alumina, calcium phosphate, thickeners, dispersing agents, and certain borate compounds as are known in the art. In the coating procedure typically the various phosphor powders can be blended by weight. The resulting powder can then be dispersed in a water based system (which may contain other additives as are known in the art, including adherence promoters such as fine non-luminescent particles of alumina or calcium pyrophosphate) optionally with a dispersing agent as is known in the art. A thickener may be added, typically polyethylene oxide. The suspension can then be typically diluted with deionized water until it is suitable for producing a coating of the desired thickness or coating weight. The phosphor blend suspension can then be applied as a coating to the inside of the glass tube (preferably by pouring the suspension down the inside of a vertically-held tube or pumping the suspension up into same) and heated by forced air until dry, as is known in the art. After the first thin coat or layer is applied, additionally desired thin coats or layers may be applied in the same manner, carefully drying each coat before the next coat is applied. Accordingly, the thin layers can be built up until the total or cumulative coating thickness is sufficient to absorb substantially all of the UV light produced by the arc. Although not intended to be limiting, this typically corresponds to a thickness of between about 1 and about 25 microns, preferably between 1 and 10 microns, depending on the exact composition of the phosphor blend and the particle size of the phosphors. For example, the phosphor layer can be applied onto the inner surface of the lamp at about 1 mg/cm2 to about 6 mg/cm2, such as about 1 mg/cm2 to about 4 mg/cm2. For convenience, the discussion and examples described herein refer to the use of the phosphor blend layer in Hg-based fluorescent lamps. However, it should be recognized that the inventive concepts include applications relating to other light sources incorporating phosphors as well, such as white LED's, xenon based discharge lamps, and plasma display panels. For example, the material may be used as a phosphor in lamp, in a cathode ray tube, in a plasma display device or in a liquid crystal display. The material may also be used as a scintillator in an electromagnetic calorimeter, in a gamma ray camera, in a computed tomography scanner or in a laser. These uses are meant to be merely exemplary and not exhaustive. In a preferred embodiment, the phosphor is used in a fluorescent light, as described above. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, as can be seen in Figs. 2 and 3, the phosphor blend described herein can be used in a compact fluorescent lamp arrangement. With reference to FIG. 3, a helical compact fluorescent lamp 30 is shown, having a lamp envelope or tube 32 in a coiled double helix configuration. End portions 32a, 32b enter the top portion 36 of the housing member 34; disposed within the end portions 32a, 32b are electrodes 38 which are electrically coupled to a ballast circuit arrangement 40 mounted within housing member 34. With respect to FIG. 2, a compact fluorescent lamp having a fluorescent tube 50, a housing 52 closed by a cap 54 and, according to the example, a screw base 56 is seen in side view. The compact fluorescent lamp is connected electrically to the mains through the base known in the art, and wires coming from the connection portions of the base are connected to a ballast circuit arranged inside the housing 52 and/or to electrodes of the fluorescent tube 50. The phosphor blend can be used as a phosphor layer applied on the inner surface of the lamp envelope 32 or tube 50, as discussed above with respect to Fig. 1. When reciting the chemical formulae for phosphors, the element(s) following the colon represents activator(s). As used herein throughout this disclosure, the term "doped" is equivalent to the term "activated". For purposes of the present disclosure, it should be understood that when a phosphor has two or more dopant ions (i.e. those ions following the colon in the above compositions), this is to mean that the phosphor has at least one (but not necessarily all) of those dopant ions within the material. That is, as understood by those skilled in the art, this type of notation means that the phosphor can include any or all of those specified ions as dopants in the formulation. The various phosphors of any color described herein can have different elements enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas, such as in (Ba,Sr,Ca)MgAl10O17:Eu2+,Mn2+ phosphor. As would be understood by anyone skilled in the art, the notation (A,B,C) signifies (AxByCz) where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ y <1 and 0 ≤z ≤1 and x+y+z=1. For example, (Sr,Ca,Ba) signifies (SrxCayBaz) where 0 ≤x ≤1 and 0 ≤y ≤1 and 0 ≤z ≤1 and x+y+z=1. Typically, but not always, x, y, and z are all nonzero. The notation (A,B) signifies (AxBy) where 0 ≤x ≤1 and 0 ≤ y ≤1 and x+y=1. Typically, but not always, x and y are both nonzero.
