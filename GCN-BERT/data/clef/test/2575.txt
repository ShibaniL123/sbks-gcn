CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Not Applicable STATEMENT RE: FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable BACKGROUND The embodiment disclosed herein relates to a facial cushion for a goggle. In various sports such as motocross, skiing, snowboarding, etc., the participant wears a goggle to prevent dirt, snow and other particulates from disturbing the wearer's eyes so that the wearer may focus on his/her surroundings. Unfortunately, in hot environments such as dessert racing, the goggle provides another layer of insulation which may cause the wearer to sweat. The sweat may roll down the wearer's forehead and eventually drip into the wearer's eyes providing another nuisance which may distract the wearer from enjoying the sport, as well as prevent the wearer from performing at an optimal level. Sweat also increases moisture and may cause fogging on the goggle lens. Additionally, these sports may also require the use of a helmet to protect the participant in the event of a fall. When a helmet is used, the straps of the goggle are strapped around the exterior of the helmet. The lens, frame and cushion are disposed immediately in front of the wearer's eyes. Unfortunately, the sides of the helmet have cushions and are offset away from the wearer's head. This causes the strap to pull outward and lift the left and right end portions of the cushion to gap away from the wearer's face. Dirt, snow and other particulates may enter the space between the goggle and irritate the wearer's eyes. Additionally, the air gap may increase wind circulation within the goggle and cause the wearer's eyes to become dry. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an improved goggle. BRIEF SUMMARY The embodiments disclosed herein address the needs discussed above, discussed below and those that are known in the art. A cushion of a goggle may have an embossed pattern to reduce skin contact of the cushion on the wearer's face. Additionally, the embossed pattern increases the total surface area of a wicking material thereby increasing the rate at which sweat is removed from the wearer's face and evaporated. Moreover, since sweat rolling into the goggle is reduced or eliminated, undesired fogging of the lens of the goggle is also reduced or eliminated. The embossed pattern also creates an air space between the wearer's face and the cushion to facilitate cooling. The cushion may be also have thicker left and right end portions compared to a middle portion so that the cushion maintains contact with the wearer's face even if the helmet 48 causes the goggle frame to open up when worn with a helmet. More particularly, a facial cushion comprising a wicking material is disclosed. The facial cushion may define an interface surface. The interface surface may have a raised surface and a depressed surface. The raised surface may directly contact a wearer's face for wicking sweat away from the wearer's face. The depressed surface may be gapped away from the wearer's face when worn. This provides an air space between the wearer's face and the depressed surface. The raised surface may be higher than the depressed surface about 0.25 mm to about 4.5 mm, and preferably between about 0.25 mm to about 2.5 mm. More particularly, the raised surface may be higher than the depressed surface about 1.5 mm. The interface surface may have a plurality of raised surfaces and depressed surfaces which define a pattern of at least one parallelogram, triangle, square, rectangle, donut, circle, nested triangle, nested parallelogram, nested square, and combinations thereof. Any embossed design or pattern is contemplated regardless of whether the design or pattern repeats. The pattern may define one or more dead air spaces. The raised surface may circumscribe an entire outer periphery of the facial cushion to provide a dead air space. Moreover, the depressed surface may circumscribe an entire inner periphery of the facial cushion. The facial cushion may further comprise a foam padding wherein the foam padding may be attached to the wicking material. In another embodiment, a goggle for use in conjunction with a helmet 48 is disclosed. The goggle may comprise a lens, a flexible frame, an elastic strap and a cushion. The lens may be disposed in front of eyes of a wearer. The flexible frame may be disposed in front of a face of the wearer and circumscribe the eyes of the wearer. The elastic strap may be disposed at opposed left and right end portions of the frame wherein the elastic strap is wrapped around the exterior of the helmet 48 and urges the goggle against the face of the wearer. The cushion may be disposed around a periphery of the flexible frame. Left and right end portions of the cushion may be thicker than a middle portion of the cushion so that the cushion maintains contact with the wearer's face when straps of the goggle are wrapped around an exterior of the helmet. The left and right end portions of the cushion may be thicker compared to the middle portion by about 5 mm or more. The cushion's thickness may gradually increase from the middle portion to the left and right end portions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Referring now to the drawings, a goggle 10 for use during motocross, snowing, skiing, and other sports and activities is shown. A facial cushion 24 of the goggle 10 may be fabricated from a series of layers 12, 28, 30 and 32 which provide comfort, cooling and moisture wicking functions to the wearer. The top layer 12 may provide the primary contact between the cushion and the wearer's face. The top layer may be fabricated from a wicking material to urge the sweat away from the wearer's face to prevent the sweat from entering the wearer's eyes. Moreover, the top layer 12 may be embossed with a pattern that defines a plurality of raised surfaces 14 and depressed surfaces 16. The depressed surfaces 16 do not contact the wearer's face when the goggle 10 is worn so as to form an air space between the top layer 12 of the cushion 24 and the wearer's face. The raised surfaces 14 contact the wearer's face when the goggle 10 is worn. Since the entire area of the top layer 12 does not contact the wearer's face, the total skin contact surface area between the cushion and the wearer's face is lower compared to prior art goggles. The reduction allows air to cool the wearer's face. Moreover, the surface area of the top layer 12 is increased since the surface area of the top layer 12 is the sum of the raised surfaces 14, depressed surfaces 16 and the sidewall surfaces 18. The increased total surface area of the top layer 12 increases moisture wicking and evaporation capabilities. Additionally, the increased moisture wicking and evaporation reduces or eliminates undesired fogging of the lens of the goggle. Additionally, the facial cushion 24 may have a thicker middle portion 42 compared to the opposed distal end portions 44, 46. When the goggle 10 is worn over a helmet 48, the straps are wrapped around the exterior of the helmet 48. The helmet 48 being bulky pulls the opposed distal end portions of the cushion 24 apart. Fortunately, the left and right end portions 44, 46 are thicker at the left and right end portions 44, 46 so that the left and right end portions maintain contact with the wearer's face. More particularly, referring now to FIG. 1, the goggle 10 may comprise a lens 20, a frame 22 and a facial cushion 24. The lens 20 may extend across both eyes of the wearer. However, it is also contemplated that the goggle may be a spectacle having two separate left and right lenses. The frame 22 may extend across the wearer's face and be positionable across the wearer's eyes. The frame 22 is shown as being a single frame for holding a single shield type lens 20 which extends across both eyes of the wearer. However, it is also contemplated that the frame 26 may be bifurcated and provide receptacles for left and right lens for protecting left and right eyes of the wearer. The single shield type lens 20 may also have a dual lens construction. The goggle 10 further comprises straps 26 that wrap around the wearer's head to press the lens 20, frame 22 and cushion 24 against the wearer's face and maintain the goggle 10 in place while the wearer participates in a physical sport. However, it is also contemplated that instead of straps 26, the goggle 10 may have left and right temples which seat onto the wearer's ears. The left and right temples may also have straps that go around the rear of the wearer's head to hold the goggle 10 on the wearer's face. Goggle as used herein refers to all types of eyewear whether a single lens such as that shown in the drawings, or bifurcated lens eyewear, face protection, eye protection, mask, etc. The facial cushion 24 as shown in FIG. 2 may comprise a plurality of stacked layers 12, 28, 30 and 32. Each of the layers 12, 28, 30, 32 may provide one or more different functions. The layers 28, 30, 32 may facilitate shaping of the overall curved shape of the facial cushion 24 and also be compressible to accommodate any mismatch between the curvature of the wearer's face and the formed curvature of the facial cushion 24. One or more of the layers 28, 30, 32 may be rigid and approximate a curved configuration of a wearer's face. Although four layers 12, 28, 30, 32 are shown and described, it is contemplated that the facial cushion 24 may comprise the top layer 12 or the top layer 12 in addition to one or more layers which may serve cushioning and shaping functions. The top layer 12 provides the primary contact between the wearer's face and the goggle 10 facial cushion 24. During use, the straps 26 are wrapped around the person's head or over the helmet 48. The straps 26 being elastic and adjustable in length are cinched down so that the goggle is pressed against the wearer's face. Accordingly, the facial cushion 24 must provide comfort to the wearer. To increase comfort to the wearer, the top layer 12 may be fabricated from a wicking material which transfer sweat and liquid away from the wearer's face. The wicking material may have a high liquid absorption property. By way of example and not limitation, the wicking material may be fleece, polyester, microfiber fabrics, wool, silk, cotton, materials currently known in the art or developed in the future. The top layer 12 may be embossed with a reticulating geometric pattern as shown in FIG. 3 to increase wicking and provide cooling. By way of example and not limitation, the top layer 12 may be attached or adhered to the second layer 28. Other methods of attachment are also contemplated which are known in the art or developed in the future. A planar view of the top layer 12 is shown in FIG. 4 which illustrates the configuration of the emboss made in the top layer 12. Referring now to FIG. 5, the embossed pattern may define a plurality of raised surfaces 14 and a plurality of depressed surfaces 16. These raised and depressed surfaces 14, 16 are joined to each other by sidewall surfaces 18. The raised surfaces 14 are offset from the depressed surfaces 16. In use, when the goggle 10 is worn, the raised surfaces 14 contact the wearer's face; whereas, the depressed surfaces 16 do not contact the wearer's face. An air space 34 is formed between the wearer's skin and the top layer 12, and more particularly, the depressed surface 16. The air space facilitates cooling. Also, the total skin contact area between the top layer 12 is less than the total skin contact area for a flat non-embossed top layer. By way of example and not limitation, the embossed pattern may provide for a reduction in total skin contact area about 35% between an embossed top layer and a flat, non embossed top layer. Other embossed patterns which provide for different % reductions are also contemplated. The emboss pattern made in the top layer 12 also increases the total surface area of the top layer 12. The total surface area of the top layer 12 is equal to the sum of the surface areas of the raised surfaces 14, the depressed surfaces 16 and the sidewall surfaces 18. By increasing the surface area of the top layer 12, the top layer 12 is better able to wick and absorb sweat and water away from the wearer's face. Additionally, the added surface area also increases the rate of evaporation so that the cushion 24 does not retain as much liquid. By way of example and not limitation, the embossed pattern may provide for an increased surface area of the top layer 12 about 35% between an embossed top layer and a flat, non-embossed top layer 12. Other embossed patterns which provide for different % increases are also contemplated. A distance 36 from the raised surface 14 to the depressed surface 16 may be between 0.25 mm and about 4.5 mm, and preferably, between about 0.25 mm and about 2.5 mm. More particularly, the distance 36 may be about 1.5 mm. The height of the raised surfaces 14 is shown as being at a consistent height. However, it is contemplated that the heights of the raised surfaces 14 may vary as desired. Additionally, the depth 36 of the depressed surfaces 16 below the raised surface 14 is shown in FIG. 5 as being consistent throughout the entire top layer 12. However, it is also contemplated that the depth 36 may vary at various areas of the top layer 12. The embossed pattern shown in FIG. 4 is shown as being a series of nested parallelograms with a central depressed surface 16 which is also configured as a parallelogram. Referring now to FIGS. 6-10, alternate embodiments of the embossed pattern are shown. In FIG. 6, the parallelogram pattern is shown. In FIG. 7, a donut pattern is shown. In FIG. 8, a nested triangular pattern in shown. In FIG. 9, a wavy pattern is shown. In FIG. 10, a combination of patterns shown in FIGS. 6, 7, 8 are shown as well as a rectangular pattern. The embossed pattern shown in the figures and described herein is for the purposes of illustration and not limitation. Accordingly, other embossed patterns are also contemplated for use in the facial cushion 24. An outer periphery of the top layer 12 may have a single continuous raised surface 14a (see FIGS. 3 and 4) to seal the air within the goggle 10 and mitigate any particulate from inadvertently entering the space within the goggle 10. The single raised surface 14a is optional. The single raised surface 14a creates a dead air space between the depressed surface 16 and the wearer's face The raised surface 14a may be about 3 mm wide 38 around the outer periphery. At the nose area, the width 40 of the single raised surface 14a may be about 4.5 mm wide. Immediately adjacent the single raised surface 14a, there may be a depressed surface 16a (see FIG. 4). The depressed surface 16a adjacent to the single raised surface 14a may be about 1 mm wide 17 and extend around inner periphery of the single raised surface 14a except for a top portion of the nose area as shown in FIG. 4. The inner periphery of the top layer 12 may be formed with the depressed surface 16 except for the nose area, as shown in FIG. 4. However, it is also contemplated that the depressed surface 16 may be formed along the entire inner periphery. The single raised surface 14a may define a face seal for providing a dead air space between the depressed surface and the wearer's face. The facial cushion 24 may extend beyond an outer periphery 50 of the frame 22, as shown in FIG. 4. The outer periphery 54 of the top layer 12 may extend outside of the outer periphery 50 of the frame 22. Moreover, the inner periphery 52 of the single continuous raised surface 14a may extend outside of the outer periphery 50 of the frame 22 so that the single raised surface 14a is disposed outside of the outer periphery 50 of the frame 22. By way of example and not limitation, the outer periphery 54 of the top layer 12 may extend outside Of the outer periphery of the frame 22 by about 6 mm. The nose area 56 of the facial cushion 24 shown in FIG. 4 must traverse over and across the nose of the wearer. The single raised surface 14a traverses vertically so that the single raised surface 14a is now at the inner periphery of the top layer 12. The single raised surface 14a extends upward and over the bridge of the nose of the wearer. Referring back to FIG. 2, the plurality of stacked layers 12, 28, 30 and 32 may collectively define a thickness 40 of the cushion 24. A thickness 40 of the facial cushion 24 at a middle portion 42 may be less compared to a thickness 40 of the left and right end portions 44, 46. The difference in thickness may be gradual, accelerated or stepped. Preferably, the facial cushion 24 gradually increases in thickness from the middle portion 42 toward the outer left and right end portions 44, 46. The difference in thickness may be attributed to a difference in thickness in any one or combination of the layers 12, 28, 30 and 32. When the goggle 10 is worn in conjunction with a helmet 48, the helmet 48 pulls the straps 26 outward. As shown in FIG. 2, a width 58 of the helmet 48 is generally wider than a width 60 of the goggle's frame. The wide helmet 48 pulls the left and right straps 26 outward and the ends of the goggle frame 22 outward as shown by arrows 56. This also pulls the left and right end portions 44, 46 of the facial cushion 24 outward and causes the left and right end portions 44, 46 of the facial cushion to lift off of the wearer's face in prior art goggles. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the thicker cushion 24 at the left and right end portions 44, 46 accommodates the spreading open of the frame 22 so that the left and right end portions 44, 46 maintain constant contact with the wearer's face despite such pulling open of the goggle frame 22 by the straps 26 and the helmet 48. Air is not allowed to flow under the cushion 24 into the goggle 10 when worn with the helmet 48. Accordingly, this provides for an ergonomic fit. For purposes of illustration and limitation, the total thickness of the cushion 24 at the opposed distal end portions 44, 46 of the cushion 24 may be about 19 mm. The fourth layer 32 may be about 6.5 mm thick. The third layer 30 may be about 2 mm thick. The second layer 28 may be about 10.5 mm thick. One or more of the layers 28, 30, 32 may decrease in thickness toward the middle portion 42 so that the total thickness of the cushion at the middle portion is about 14 mm. Although a 5 thickness mm difference between the middle portion 42 and the distal end portions 44, 46 is illustrated, it is also contemplated that the thickness difference may be greater than about 5 mm or less than 5 mm. The stack of layers 12, 28, 30, 32 may serve different functions. By way of example and not limitation, the second, third and fourth layers 28, 30, 32 may be fabricated from various materials to provide cushion and shape to the facial cushion to provide comfort to the wearer. The flexibility of the goggle 10 may be adjusted by increasing the thicknesses of the second and third layers 28, 30 while decreasing the thickness of the fourth layer 32. Conversely, the comfort of the goggle 10 may be enhanced by increasing the foam cushion layer 32. It is also contemplated that the soft foam cushion which is the fourth layer 32 may be disposed immediately adjacent to the top layer 12. In other words, the top layer 12 may be mounted to a foam cushion instead of the stiff second layer 28. The thickness 40 of the cushion 24 may also vary vertically. By way of example and not limitation, the lower side of the cushion 24 near the mouth of the wearer may be thicker compared to the upper side of the cushion 24 near the forehead of the wearer. Conversely, the upper side of the cushion 24 may be thicker compared to the lower side of the cushion 24. Furthermore, it is also contemplated that the cushion 24 may have a constant vertical cross sectional thickness. The above description is given by way of example, and not limitation. Given the above disclosure, one skilled in the art could devise variations that are within the scope and spirit of the invention disclosed herein, including various ways of forming the stack of layers 12, 28, 30, 32. Further, the various features of the embodiments disclosed herein can be used alone, or in varying combinations with each other and are not intended to be limited to the specific combination described herein.
