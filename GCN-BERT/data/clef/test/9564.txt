RECIPROCATING FOOD RICER Field of the Invention [0001] The present invention relates to a food ricer. More particularly, the present invention relates to a hand-operated food ricer configured with a reciprocating mechanism. Background of the Invention [0002] Mechanical food processors have a very long history in catering environments requiring volume processing of foodstuffs, typically vegetables and fruits. The advent of powered automation, particularly that conferred by the development of inexpensive electrical motors, has resulted in ever more types of food processing devices and their widespread adoption in catering circumstances ranging from ad hoc domestic use to daily industrial use. [0003] Accordingly, a very wide variety of food ricers currently exists for professional use, ranging from relatively small hand-operated devices, for instance as manufactured and sold under the name CF-5 by Sammic UK Limited of Leicester, United Kingdom, or under the name HPC Detachable Block by Metcalfe Catering Equipment Limited of Gwynedd, United Kingdom, to relatively large electrically-powered devices, for instance as respectively manufactured and sold under the names CS-C1 and PC2 by IMC Limited of Wrexham, United Kingdom. [0004] No professional food ricer has yet successfully combined the characteristics of ease of operation and durability, and volume use permitted by, the larger electrically-powered devices, with the simplicity and the dependability associated with hand-operated devices. In particular, no hand-operated professional food ricer has yet been provided, which substantially reduces the compressive forces traditionally required to operate the device for cutting foodstuffs therein. Summary of the Invention [0005] According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a food ricer comprising a body having an inlet and an outlet, each intersecting an internal translation pathway, a food receptacle adapted to translate within the pathway, a food processing means located between the pathway and the outlet, and a reciprocating mechanism operably connecting the food receptacle to a handle. Actuation of the handle causes the reciprocating mechanism to longitudinally translate the food receptacle within the pathway up to and away from the outlet; and each translation of the food receptacle causes foodstuffs located therein to be processed by the food processing means and to exit the outlet. [0006] A continuous and unidirectional rotation of the handle thus imparts a bidirectional alternating movement to the food receptacle, whereby foodstuff located therein is iteratively, thus progressively, processed by the food processing means, in the manner of e.g. a fruit or vegetable being hand-run onto a mandolin sheer. However, the enclosed character of the pathway advantageously removes any cutting hazard for the user, and the reduction ration inherent to the reciprocating mechanism advantageously reduces the amount of physical force required to process the foodstuffs. [0007] In a preferred embodiment, the food processing means and the outlet are preferably arranged so that each translation of the food receptacle away from the outlet causes foodstuffs located in the food receptacle to be processed by the food processing means, and each translation of the food receptacle towards the outlet causes food processed by the food processing means to exit the outlet. [0008] In an alternative embodiment, the food ricer may comprise a second internal pathway located adjacent and substantially parallel to the internal pathway and intersected by the outlet, wherein the food processing means is located between the first and second pathways. [0009] In a further variant of this embodiment, the food ricer may comprise a second food processing means located between the second pathway and the outlet, wherein each translation of the food receptacle towards the outlet causes food processed by the food processing means to be processed by the second food processing means and to exit the outlet. [0010] This embodiment effectively implements double processing of the foodstuffs introduced in the food ricer, advantageously without modifying the user interface of a handle and input movement to that handle, and without adding any substantial amount of physical force to that input movement. [0011] In a preferred embodiment, the body of the food ricer is substantially oblong and has a substantially square cross-section, in order to both facilitate, and reduce costs associated with, all of manufacture, use, maintenance and storage. In a further variant of this embodiment, the inlet and the outlet are preferably opposed to, and substantially aligned with, one another at an extremity of the body. The simplicity of this configuration is again expected to keep material, labour and cost requirements associated with manufacture to a minimum. [0012] In a preferred embodiment, the food ricer is intended to cut, dice and/or otherwise chop vegetables and fruits, whereby the food processing means preferably comprises at least one slicing blade. It will be readily understood by the skilled person that many alternative food processing tools can be adapted for use with the food ricer of the invention, for instance depending on the shape and/or size required for the processed food; indeed the food processing means may be removable and the food ricer may be adapted to use at least one amongst a wide variety of different types of removable food processing means at any given time. [0013] In an alternative embodiment of the food ricer having a second pathway and second food processing means, such second food processing means may comprise a plurality of blades arranged substantially parallel to each other, and this embodiment is considered particularly useful for processing potatoes (and the like) into chips or fries. [0014] In a preferred embodiment, the reciprocating mechanism includes a crank operably connected to at least one link, the handle being operably connected to the crank through the wall of the body and the link being operably connected to an extremity of the food receptacle. By way of technical analogy, this configuration corresponds substantially to the configuration of a piston in a combustion engine, with the food receptacle as the piston, the first pathway as the chamber and the link and the crank as, respectively, the connecting rod shaft and the camshaft. This mechanical configuration is time-proven as robust and providing a very efficient transfer of the forces involved. [0015] The food ricer of the invention is intended for use in professional catering environments, which are subjected to very strict hygiene standards for the welfare of users and customers, and is considered particularly useful for traditional fish and chips restaurants. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, each of the body, the food receptacle, the food processing means and the reciprocating mechanism is made of at least one material selected from the group comprising high-purity ceramics, plastics, and stainless steel materials. [0016] According to another aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a kit of parts for a food ricer, comprising a body having an inlet and an outlet, each intersecting an internal translation pathway; a food receptacle adapted to translate within the pathway; a food processing means located between the pathway and the outlet; and a reciprocating mechanism operably connecting the food receptacle to a handle. [0017] According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a method of processing a foodstuff with a food ricer as described above and as claimed herein, which comprises the steps of actuating the handle until the food receptacle is translated to coincide substantially with the inlet, placing the foodstuff in the food receptacle, then further actuating the handle, thereby causing the foodstuff to be processed by the food processing means and to exit the outlet. [0018] With reference to the embodiment of the food ricer described above as having a second pathway and second food processing means, the method step of causing the foodstuff to be processed by the food processing means preferably further comprises the steps of causing the foodstuff to be processed into a plurality of slices by the first food processing means, and causing each slice to be processed into a plurality of chips by the second food processing means. [0019] Other aspects are as set out in the claims herein.

Detailed Description of the Embodiments [0021] There will now be described by way of example a specific mode contemplated by the inventors. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding. It will be apparent however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without limitation to these specific details. In other instances, well known methods and structures have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the description. [0022] With reference to Figures 1Α to 1D herein, which all relate to a same embodiment of the inventive principles disclosed herein, a food ricer 100 is shown which comprises a body 110 having an inlet 120 and an outlet 130. [0023] The body 110 is substantially oblong in shape and hollow, and has a substantially square cross-section, wherein an internal translation pathway 140 is defined therein by four rectangular walls 1411_4, conventionally consisting of two perpendicular sets of two parallel walls. [0024] In this embodiment, the inlet 120 is a through-aperture in the top wall 1411, which it therefore intersects. The outlet 130 is a through-aperture in the bottom wall 1413, which it therefore intersects likewise, wherein the top and bottom walls 141·ΐ, 1413 are parallel to one another. The inlet 120 and the outlet 130 are substantially aligned in opposition to one another adjacent an extremity of the body 110 distal a handle 150, which is mated to an internal reciprocating mechanism 160 through a lateral wall 1412 perpendicular to the top and bottom walls 141 -i, 1413. [0025] With reference to Figures 2Α to 2D herein, internal features and aspects of configuration of the food ricer 100 are shown, wherein a food receptacle 200, first food processing means 210 and second food processing means 220 are located within the volume bounded by the internal translation pathway 140, and wherein the food receptacle 200 is mechanically articulated to the internal reciprocating mechanism 160. [0026] The food receptacle 200 comprises an upper opening 201 bounded by four lateral walls 202·μ. The four walls 2011_4, conventionally consist of two perpendicular sets of two parallel walls, whereby at least two opposed and parallel walls 2022, 2014 of the receptacle, are respectively parallel and adjacent to opposed and parallel walls 1412, 1414, of the pathway 140. The food receptacle 200 further, opposite the upper opening 201, a bottom 203 having a through-aperture 204 with a dimension adapted to let only a lower portion of foodstuffs in the receptacle 200 projecting underneath the food receptacle 200 at any given time. [0027] The food receptacle 200 is adapted to translate longitudinally, in practice to slide back and forth within the pathway 140 along a plane parallel to a main axis of the body 110, under the action of the reciprocating mechanism 160 actuated by the handle 150, above the first and second food processing means 210, 220. [0028] The first food processing means 210 is secured in position within the translation pathway, which it bisects transversally and substantially intermediate the inlet and outlets 120, 130, defining thus an upper internal translation pathway 140-ΐ within which the food receptacle 200 reciprocates, and a lower internal translation pathway 1402. In this embodiment, the first food processing means 210 is a planar slicing blade, having a cutting edge oriented towards the inlet 120. [0029] The second food processing means 220 is also secured in position within the translation pathway underneath the blade 210, at the outset of the lower pathway 1402 adjacent the outlet 130. In this embodiment, the second food processing means 220 comprises a plurality of chipping blades 220-μ arranged substantially parallel to each other and perpendicular to the slicing blade 210, with each chipping blade having its cutting edge oriented away from the outlet 130. [0030] A lower part of the rear wall 2023 of the food receptacle 200, which is perpendicular to the walls of the receptacle 2022, 2024 parallel to the pathway 140 and facing away from the outlet 120, projects a short distance rearwards, towards the reciprocating mechanism 160, perpendicularly to the main plane of the rear wall 2023 and substantially parallel to the bottom 203. The bottom 203 itself projects correspondingly rearwards past the main plane of the rear wall towards the reciprocating mechanism 160. The resulting volume of rearward-projecting material forms a dogleg extension 180 fixedly connecting the food receptacle 200 to a pushing member 190, located thereunder and longitudinally offset relative thereto, which thus reciprocates in tandem with the food receptacle 200 in the lower internal translation pathway 1402. [0031] An external surface of the rear wall 2023 above the projecting lower part comprises an attachment interface 142 for articulating the food receptacle 200 to the components of the internal reciprocating mechanism 160. In this embodiment the interface 142 is a fixed pivot joint having its course restricted to the vertical dimension, and to which a first extremity 301 of a first longitudinal shaft or link 302 is pivotally secured. A second, longitudinally opposed extremity 303 of the shaft 302 is pivotally secured to a first extremity 304 of a second longitudinal shaft 305, having its pivoting course likewise restricted to the vertical dimension. [0032] The second shaft 305 acts as a crankshaft whereby a second, longitudinally opposed extremity 306 of the second shaft 305 is fixedly secured to a first extremity 307 of a transversal shaft 308, which exits the body 110 through the lateral wall 1412 perpendicular to the top and bottom walls 141·ΐ, 1413 and to a second, longitudinally opposed extremity 309 of which the handle 150 is mated. [0033] Figures 3Α to 3D illustrate a sequence of the successive configurations of the food receptacle 200, pushing member 190 and components of the reciprocating mechanism 160 during a revolution of the handle 150. [0034] The mechanical configuration of the components of the food ricer 100 provides that a continuous and unidirectional rotation of the handle 150 imparts a bidirectional alternating movement to the food receptacle 200, whereby foodstuff located therein is iteratively, thus progressively, processed by the first and second food processing means 210, 220-μ. The food processing means 210, 220-μ and the outlet 130 are arranged so that each translation of the food receptacle 200 away from the outlet 130 causes foodstuffs located in the food receptacle 200 to be processed by the first food processing means 210, and each translation of the food receptacle 200 towards from the outlet 130 causes food to be processed by the second food processing means 220-μ and exit the outlet 130. [0035] With reference to Figure 3Α firstly, a foodstuff 400, in the example a potato, is inserted through the inlet 120 into the food receptacle 200 aligned therewith, whereby an underside portion 401 of the potato protrudes through the aperture 204 and at least partially into the volume defined by the lower internal translation pathway 1402, as symbolised by arrows 500. [0036] Rotation of the handle 150, in the example clockwise as symbolised by an arrow 510, causes the crankshaft 305 to be rotated in the same direction. The extremity 303 of the link 302 is, correspondingly, both pulled by the crankshaft 305 towards the rear of the food ricer 100 and pivoted vertically and upwards therein through its pivoted extremity 304. The opposed first extremity 301 of the link 302 is maintained within the fixed pivot joint 142 of the food receptacle 200, within which it rotates in accordance with the rotation imparted to the opposed extremity 303 by the crankshaft movement, whereby the combination of the food receptacle 200 and the pushing member 190 are translated rearward within their respective translation pathways 140-ΐ, 1402, symbolised by respective arrows 520-ΐ, 5202. [0037] With reference to Figure 3Β next, as the food receptacle 200 continues to be pulled rearwards, the protruding underside portion 401 of the potato 400 is abutted to, then pulled against, the cutting edge of the slicing blade 210. As the pushing member 190 is pulled rearwards correspondingly with the food receptacle 200, a longitudinal void 530 extends into the lower internal translation pathway 1402 between the receding pusher 190 and the fixed chipping blades 220-i_4. As the food receptacle 200 runs its rearward longitudinal course 520ΐ its end wall 202ΐ opposed to the rear wall 2023 eventually reaches the cutting edge of the slicing blade 210 in a vertical plane, whereby the potato portion 401 is fully cut from the potato 400 into a scallop 401 which falls into the void 530 under the force of gravity, as symbolised by an arrow 540. [0038] With reference to Figure 3C next, the food receptacle 200 reaches the end of its rearward course 520-ΐ as the crankshaft 305 reaches the half-way point of its rotation arc. Continued clockwise rotation of the handle 150 causes the crankshaft 305 to continue its rotation and the extremity 303 of the link 302 is, correspondingly, now both pushed by the crankshaft 305 towards the front of the food ricer 100 and pivoted vertically still but and downwards therein through its pivoted extremity 304. The opposed first extremity 301 of the link 302 is still maintained within the fixed pivot joint 142 of the food receptacle 200, within which it rotates in accordance with the rotation imparted to the opposed extremity 303 by the crankshaft movement, whereby the combination of the food receptacle 200 and the pushing member 190 are now translated forward within their respective translation pathways 140-ΐ, 1402, symbolised by respective arrows 550ΐ, 5502. [0039] The potato 400 abuts, and slides over, the topside of the slicing blade 210 during its forward translation within the food receptacle 200, wherein it remains until substantially clear of the blade 210. Likewise, the potato scallop 401 abuts and slides over the bottom wall 1413 of the food sheer body 110 as it is pushed by the pushing member 190 towards the chipping blades 220i_4. As the combination of the food receptacle 200 and the pusher 190 continues to be pushed forward, the void 530 gradually reduces in length, and the potato scallop 401 is eventually abutted to, then pushed against, the respective cutting edges of the chipping blades 220-μ. [0040] With reference to Figure 3D now, as the food receptacle 200 runs its forward longitudinal course 550! its end wall 202-ΐ opposed to the rear wall 2023 eventually abuts the end wall of the slicing blade 210, aligning the food receptacle 200 with the inlet 120. In this position, the underside of the potato 400 in the food receptacle 200 is clear of the slicing blade 210 and a next underside portion 411 of the potato 400 protrudes through the aperture 204 and again at least partially into the volume defined by the lower internal translation pathway 1402, as symbolised by arrows 500. [0041] Likewise, the offset pushing member 190 runs its forward longitudinal course 5502 and its end wall eventually abuts the chipping blades 220-μ, leaving no void 530. At that stage, the potato scallop 401 has been fully sliced into four potato chips 410, which exit the food ricer 100 through the outlet 130 under the force of gravity, as symbolised by an arrow 560. The sequence illustrated in Figures 3Α to 3D may then be repeated by continuing to rotate the handle 150, in the example clockwise, until the entire potato 400 has been processed into potato chips. In practice, the sequence illustrated in Figures 3Α to 3D is expected to be performed uninterruptedly, i.e. the handle 150 continually operated by a user after a fresh potato 400 has been placed into the food ricer 100 until it is fully processed. [0042] It will be readily understood by the skilled reader that many different configurations of the components of the food ricer 100 may be devised, all of which based upon the reciprocating principle disclosed herein. For instance, with reference now to Figures 4Α and 4Β, wherein like numerals have been used to designate like features, an alternative embodiment of a food ricer 101 is shown, respectively in top and side views, which is essentially identical to the food ricer 100 but wherein the slicing blade 210 is located substantially between, and transverse the respective planes of, the inlet 120 and outlet 130, thus substantially underneath the bottom 203 and through-aperture 204 of the receptacle 200 when the receptacle 200 is aligned with the inlet 120 for receiving new foodstuffs therein. [0043] In this configuration, the cutting edge of the slicing blade 210 is facing rearward, away from the inlet and outlets 120, 130, therefore in the same direction as the respective cutting blades of the chipping blades 220-μ. This configuration advantageously allows a shorter pusher member 190, because the dogleg extension 180 between the pusher 190 and the food receptacle 200 does not require a length corresponding to at least the slicing blade 210 with reference to the reciprocating courses 510, 520. Correspondingly, this configuration advantageously allows a shorter body 110 to be used relative to the embodiment shown in Figures 1A to 3D, and which illustrated in Figures 4Α and 4Β by reference to the body of the ricer 100 shown in dotted line therein. [0001] With reference to the description of Figures 3Α to 3D hereinbefore, the alternative embodiment of the food ricer 101 operates according to the same reciprocating principle, wherein a foodstuff may again be inserted through the inlet 120 into the food receptacle 200 aligned therewith, but in this embodiment, the underside of the foodstuff abuts and effectively rests upon the topside of the slicing blade, and against which it will slide over during its rearward translation within the food receptacle in the direction 520ΐ when the handle 150 is rotated 510. [0002] As the food receptacle 200 runs its rearward longitudinal course 520! the underside of the foodstuff in the food receptacle 200 eventually gets clear of the top of the slicing blade 210 and an underside portion thereof will accordingly protrude, under the force of gravity, through the aperture 204 and at least partially into the longitudinal void 530 extending in the lower internal translation pathway 1402 between the receding pusher 190 and the fixed chipping blades 220-μ. [0003] When the food receptacle 200 eventually reaches the end of its rearward course 520-ΐ, the reciprocating motion of the crankshaft 305 will again push it back towards the front of the food ricer 101. As the food receptacle 200 continues to be pushed forward, the protruding underside portion of the foodstuff is abutted to, and then pushed against, the rear-facing cutting edge of the slicing blade 210. As the pushing member 190 is pushed forward correspondingly with the food receptacle 200, it pushes the protruding underside portion against the similarly rear-facing cutting edges of the chipping blades 220-μ. In this embodiment therefore, with reference to the example potato 400 of Figures 3Α to 3D, the scallop 401 is cut off from the main body of the potato 400 at the same time as it is cut into several potato chips 410 by the chipping blades 220-μ. [0004] As the food receptacle 200 eventually runs its forward longitudinal course 550-ΐ, the food receptacle 200 becomes aligned with the inlet 120 again and, in this position, the underside portion is fully cut, both away from the remaining body of foodstuff still in the food receptacle 200 and into discrete sub-portions by the chipping blades 220-m which all exist the food ricer 101 via the outlet 130 under the force of gravity. The underside of the remaining body of foodstuff in the food receptacle 200 again rests upon the topside of the slicing blade 210, and so on and so forth. [0005] The mechanical configuration of the components of the alternative food ricer 101 thus again provides that a continuous and unidirectional rotation of the handle 150 imparts a bidirectional alternating movement to the food receptacle 200, whereby foodstuff located therein is iteratively, thus progressively, processed by the first and second food processing means 210, 220-μ. In this embodiment, the food processing means 210, 220-μ and the outlet 130 are arranged so that each translation of the food receptacle 200 towards the outlet 130 causes foodstuffs located in the food receptacle 200 to be processed by both the first and second food processing means 210, 220-μ and exit the outlet 130. [0006] All of the components shown in Figures 1Α to 4Β and described hereinbefore are manufactured of stainless steel, and are operably connected to one another with such means as for instance stainless steel fasteners, in order to facilitate their comprehensive dismantling after use for comprehensive cleaning and maintenance purposes. It will also be readily understood by the skilled reader that the slicing blade 210 and chipping blades 220^4 are shown and described herein by way of non-limitative example.
