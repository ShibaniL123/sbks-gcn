CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2012-0081403, filed on Jul. 25, 2012 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field The present invention relates to a condensed-cyclic compound and an organic light-emitting device including the condensed-cyclic compound. 2. Description of the Related Art Organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) are self-emitting devices having advantages such as wide viewing angles, good contrast, quick response speeds, high brightness, and good driving voltage characteristics. Additionally, OLEDs can provide multicolored images. A typical OLED has a structure including a substrate on which is sequentially stacked an anode, a hole transport layer (HTL), an emission layer (EML), an electron transport layer (ETL), and a cathode. In this regard, the HTL, the EML, and the ETL are organic thin films formed of organic compounds. The operating principle of an OLED having the above-described structure is as follows. When a voltage is applied between the anode and the cathode, holes injected from the anode move to the EML via the HTL, and electrons injected from the cathode move to the EML via the ETL. The holes and electrons recombine in the EML to generate excitons. When the excitons drop from an excited state to a ground state, light is emitted. There is a demand an emission layer material, and in particular, a material for a blue emission layer, with high color purity and improved lifetime.

The condensed-cyclic compound of Formula 1 above may be used as an emitting material, a hole injecting material, and/or a hole transporting material of an organic light-emitting device.

FIG. 1 is a schematic sectional view of an organic light-emitting device 10 according to an embodiment of the present invention. Hereinafter, a structure of an organic light-emitting device according to an embodiment of the present invention and a method of manufacturing the same will be described with reference to FIG. 1. Referring to FIG. 1, the organic light-emitting device 10 according to the present embodiment includes a first electrode 13, an organic layer 15, and a second electrode 17, which are sequentially stacked on a substrate 11. The substrate 11 may be any substrate that is used in existing organic light-emitting devices. In some embodiments, the substrate 11 may be a glass substrate or a transparent plastic substrate with good mechanical strength, thermal stability, transparency, surface smoothness, ease of handling, and water resistance. The first electrode 13 may be formed by depositing or sputtering a first electrode-forming material on the substrate 11. When the first electrode 13 is an anode, a material having a high work function may be used as the first electrode-forming material to facilitate hole injection. The first electrode 13 may be a reflective electrode or a transparent electrode. Suitable first electrode-forming materials include transparent and conductive materials such as ITO, IZO, SnO2, and ZnO. In some embodiments, the first electrode 13 may be formed as a reflective electrode using magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), aluminum-lithium (Al—Li), calcium (Ca), magnesium-indium (Mg—In), magnesium-silver (Mg—Ag), or the like. The first electrode 13 may have a single-layer structure or a multi-layer structure including at least two layers. For example, the first electrode 13 may have a three-layered structure of ITO/Ag/ITO, but is not limited thereto. The organic layer 15 may be disposed on the first electrode 13. The organic layer 15 may include a hole injection layer (HIL), a hole transport layer (HTL), an emission layer (EML), an electron transport layer (ETL), and an electron injection layer (EIL). The HIL may be formed on the first electrode 13 by vacuum deposition, spin coating, casting, Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition, or the like. When the HIL is formed by vacuum deposition, the vacuum deposition conditions may vary according to the compound used to form the HIL, and the desired structure and thermal properties of the HIL to be formed. For example, vacuum deposition may be performed at a temperature of about 100° C. to about 500° C., a pressure of about 10−8 torr to about 10−3 torr, and a deposition rate of about 0.01 to about 100 Å/sec. However, the deposition conditions are not limited thereto. When the HIL is formed using spin coating, the coating conditions may vary according to the compound used to form the HIL, and the desired structure and thermal properties of the HIL to be formed. For example, the coating rate may be in the range of about 2,000 rpm to about 5,000 rpm, and the temperature at which heat treatment is performed to remove solvent after coating may be in the range of about 80° C. to about 200° C. However, the coating conditions are not limited thereto. For example, as the HIL material, the condensed-cyclic compound of Formula 1, or any known hole injection materials may be used. Non-limiting examples of hole injection materials include N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis-[4-(phenyl-m-tolyl-amino)-phenyl]-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine, (DNTPD), a phthalocyanine compound such as copperphthalocyanine, 4,4′,4″-tris(3-methylphenylphenylamino)triphenylamine (m-MTDATA), 4.4′4″-Tris(N,N-diphenylamino)triphenylamine (TDATA), 4,4′,4″-tris{N,-(2-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino}-triphenylamine (2T-NATA), polyaniline/dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (PANI/DBSA), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS), polyaniline/camphor sulfonicacid (PANI/CSA), and polyaniline)/poly(4-styrenesulfonate (PANI/PSS). The thickness of the HIL may be about 100 Å to about 10,000 Å, and for example, about 100 Å to about 1,000 Å. When the thickness of the HIL is within these ranges, the HIL may have good hole injecting ability without substantially increasing driving voltage. Then, a HTL may be formed on the HIL by vacuum deposition, spin coating, casting, Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition, or the like. When the HTL is formed by vacuum deposition or spin coating, the conditions for deposition or coating may be similar to those for the formation of the HIL, though the conditions for the deposition or coating may vary according to the material used to form the HTL. The HTL may be formed of the condensed-cyclic compound of Formula 1 or any known hole transporting materials. Examples of hole transporting materials include carbazole derivatives such as N-phenylcarbazole, polyvinylcarbazole, and the like; triphenylamine materials such as TPD (N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-[1,1-biphenyl]-4,4′-diamine), NPB(N,N′-di(1-n aphthyl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine, TCTA (4,4′,4″-tris(N-carbazolyl)triphenylamine), and the like. The thickness of the HTL may be about 50 Å to about 1,000 Å, and for example, about 100 Å to about 800 Å. When the thickness of the HTL 14 is within these ranges, the HTL 140 may have satisfactory hole transporting ability without substantially increasing driving voltage. In some embodiments, instead of the HIL and the HTL, a hole injection transport layer may be formed. The hole injection transport layer may contain at least one hole injection layer material and at least one hole transport layer material. The thickness of the hole injection transport layer may be from about 500 Å to about 10,000 Å, and in some embodiments, may be from about 100 Å to about 1,000 Å.
