(1S,3R)-1-(4-Bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (0.280 g, 0.64 mmol) in propionic acid (2.66 mL) was cooled to −17° C. (dry ice/acetone bath). Sodium nitrite (0.044 g, 0.64 mmol) in water (0.53 mL) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was stirred at −17° C. for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was diluted with ice-cold toluene (15 mL) and stirred at 4° C. for 15 minutes. The mixture was then stirred and warmed to room temperature for 45 minutes. The reaction mixture was washed with water (2×15 mL), the combined aqueous phases were washed with EtOAc (2×10 mL), the combined organics washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (1×20 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and the filtrate evaporated to an orange-brown oil. The crude material was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0-40% EtOAc in heptane to afford (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (0.216 g, 75%) as an off-white solid.
