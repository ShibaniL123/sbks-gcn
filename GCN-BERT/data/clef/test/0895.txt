Intermediate 6: 7-Methoxy-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)indolin-2-one
Step A: 5-Bromo-7-methoxyindoline-2,3-dione. To a suspension of 7-methoxyindoline-2,3-dione (1.0 g, 5.6 mmol) in AcOH (5.6 mL) was added bromine (0.35 mL, 6.7 mmol) at 0Â° C. The mixture was allowed to stir at rt for 2 h and was then poured into ice and stirred for 0.5 h. The resulting mixture was filtered and the solids were washed with H2O to afford the title compound as an orange solid (1.3 g, 92%).
