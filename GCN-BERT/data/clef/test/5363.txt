The present invention relates to a process for efficiently producing an aminoalkylsulfonic acid in an industrial scale, and a method of salt exchange for an aminoalkylsulfonate salt. Prior Art Aminoalkylsulfonic acids are useful compounds as intermediate raw materials such as skin cleansing agents consisting of soap and shampoo, surfactants and pH buffers, and drug raw materials. Further, since aminoalkylsulfonic acids are amphoteric compounds having a strongly acidic functional group together with an amine group, it is expected that a fatty acid soap having different - properties can be prepared by neutralizing a fatty acid with taurine or N-methyltaurine, which are a type of said compound, together with a strong alkali such as sodium hydroxide, to form a counterion bond between a carboxyl group of the fatty acid and an amine group of the amphoteric compound. As a method for producing aminoalkylsulfonic acids, the following methods are known; for example, (1) a method for reacting ethyleneimine, sulfurous acid gas and water [see, e.g. JP-B-40-23007 (p. 1), JP-B-47-16807 (p.l), etc.], (2) a method for heating Nmethylaminoethane sulfate salt at 120-210°C [see, e.g. JP-B-46-2087 (p. 1)], (3) a method for oxidation of 2,2-disubstituted thiazolidine with hydrogemperoxide, followed by hydrolysis [see, e.g. JP-A-57-26654 (p.1-2)], (4)'a‘ method for reacting 2-aminoethanol sulfate ester with sodium sulfite [see, e.g. Journal of the Chemical_Socie.ty,_p.4_(.l-94.3.).]., (5) a method for reacting a hydrogen halide salt of 2-halogenoethylamine with a sulfite salt [see, e.g. Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol.58, p.191 (1936)], (6) a method for reacting a sulfite salt in an aqueous solution heated at temperature not lower than 50°C with a halogenated alkylamine [see, e.g. WO 84/00958 (p.5 and 20), JP-A-6023360 (p.l and 3), JP-A-4-149168 (p.1-3), etc.]. However, these methods have the following problems. Namely, the method (1) has problems such as difficult to control of reaction temperature due to generation of an extremely exothermic reaction; low yield due to side reactions such as polymerization of ethyleneimine; and difficult to handle to ethyleneimine and sulfurous acid gas as starting materials in an industrial scale due to toxicities. The method (2) has a problem of difficult to handle production in an_industriaLscale’d-ue to a reaction at high temperature. The method (3) has problems such as use of hydrogen peroxide which is difficult-to-handle in view of safety; and complicated operations. requiring recovery and reuse of ketone type as by-products. The method (4) has problems such as heating for long period due to extremely slow reaction of sulfate esters with sodium sulfite, thereby resulting in low yield due to production of ethanolamine as a by-product by hydrolysis of sulfate esters during the reaction; difficult to separate and recovery monoethanolamine as a by-product. Further, the method (5) and (6) have a problem of difficult to separate and recovery sulfite salts required to be used in excess amount. Furthermore, the following methods are known as methods for producing an aminoalkylsulfonic acid from an aminoalkylsulfate salt: for example, (I) a method for reacting ammonium aminoethanesulfonate with hydrogen chloride, followed by extracting resulting aminoethanesulfonic acid with 95% ethanol and cooling the ethanol aqueous solution to precipitate an objective compound [see, e.g. Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, Vol.39, P.906 (1947)]; and (II) a method for reacting an aqueous solution of sodium aminoethanesulfonate with a mineral acid such as sulfuric acid and hydrogen chloride, followed by concentrating the resulting aqueous solution of aminoethanesulfonic acid to crystallize a part of sodium chloride as impurities at high temperature not lower than 80°C, and dilute the mother liquid with water and cooling to obtain an objective compound as crystal [see, e.g. DE 1122540 (p.3-4 and 13), JP-A-6345717 (p.2-4) etc.]. However, the method (I) has problems'such as an undesirable industrial process due to a large amount of ethanol to be used for extraction; repeated operations, of the extraction to obtain high purity product; complicated treatment to be required for separating ammonium hydrochloride as impurities which is contained in almost the same amount toran objective compound; and undesirable disposal of the impurity in view of environmental conservation.. In addition, the method (II) has problems such as complicated operations to be required for difficult; to separate inorganic substances such as sodium chloride as impurities and a water-soluble aminoalkylsulfonic acid in an aqueous solution; and repeated operations to be required for recovery of filtrate and crystallization because an object compound can be crystallized only partly by this method. Under such circumstances, development of a method for efficiently producing Jiigh„purityaminoalkylsulfonic acid in an industrial scale is required.

Since the aminoalkylsulfonic acid obtained by these methods precipitates as crystal, and the organic acid salt as by-product is dissolved in a reaction solvent, the resulting crystal is recovered by filtration to obtain easily an objective aminoalkylsulfonic acid. Further, when said aminoalkylsulfonic acid is produced in an industrial scale, the above methods (B) and (C) are preferable. However, the aminoalkylsulfonate salt represented by the general formula [1] as the starting material is available more easily in aqueous solution form, therefore, when such a solution is used, the method (C) is more preferable. The aminoalkylsulfonate salt represented by the general formula [1] or an aqueous solution thereof may be a commercially available product or one synthesized suitably in accordance with a common method. When said aminoalkylsulfonate salt is used in aqueous solution form, less water content is preferable in case of obtaining an object product in higher yield, and such amount of water content as not to be solidified is preferable in case of conducting the reaction in an industrial scale. Specifically, water content is generally 5 to 80%, and preferably to 30%, relative to said aminoalkylsulfonate salt. An amount of the water-soluble organic solvent to be used in production of an aminoalkylsulfonic acid represented by the general formula [2] depends on kinds of the aminoalkylsulfonate salt represented by the general formula [1] to be used, and generally 0.5 to times by weight, and preferably 1 to 5 times by weight, relative to said aminoalkylsulfonate salt. When the water-soluble organic solvent are mixed with water, total amount of the water-soluble organic solvent and water is generally 0.5 to 30 times by weight, and preferably 1 to 10 times by weight, relative to the aminoalkylsulfonate salt represented by the general formula [1] to be used. An amount of the organic acid to be used depends on each kinds of said aminoalkylsulfonate salt and a solvent, to be used, and generally 0.5 to 10 times by mole, and preferably 0.8 to 2 times by mole, relative to said aminoalkylsulfonate salt. Reaction temperature is not especially limited, and generally 0 to 200°C, preferably 0 to 110°C, and more preferably 20 to 50°C. Further, reaction temperature may be raised by applying pressure to the reaction system with inert gas such as helium gas, nitrogen gas and argon gas. In this case, pressure to be'applied is, even if applying too high pressure, is not effective to improve reaction efficiency, and generally 1 to kg/cm2, and preferably 2 to 10 kg/cm2. Reaction time depends on reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, kinds of said aminoalkylsulfonate salt to be used, each amount of the organic solvent and the organic acid to be used, and concentrations of these substances, and generally 5 minutes to 5 hours. Further, the aminoalkylsulfonic acid represented by the general formula. [2], obtained by the method for production of the present invention can further be reacted with the hydroxide represented by the general formula [6], in alcohol or water, to produce the aminoalkylsulfonate salt represented by the general formula [1’], the salt of which has been exchanged to an objective salt (including the case when M in the general formula [1J and M’ in the general formula [6] are same). Namely, the method of salt exchange of the present invention can be used for a purification process of the aminoalkylsulfonate salt represented by the general formula [1], when M in the general formula [1] and M’ in the general formula [1’] are same, while the method can also be used for a purification process and a salt exchange process, of the aminoalkylsulfonate salt represented by the general formula [1], when said M and M’ are different from each other. The alcohol to be used in reaction with the hydroxide represented by the general formula [6] includes, for example, methanol, ethanol, glycerin, etc. An amount of the solvent to be used in this reaction depends on kinds of the aminoalkylsulfonic acid to be used, represented by the general formula [2], and generally 0.5 to 30 times by weight, and preferably 1 to 10 times by weight, relative to said aminoalkylsulfonic acid. An amount of the hydroxide to be used, represented by the general formula [6] depends on each kinds of said aminoalkylsulfonic acid and the solvent, and generally 0.5 to 10 times by mole, and preferably 0.8 to 1.2 times by mole, relative to said aminoalkylsulfonic acid. Further, in order to obtain the aminoalkylsulfonate salt represented by the general formula [T] in high purity, it is desirable to be reacted with equimolar ratio of the hydroxide represented by the general formula [6], relative to said aminoalkylsulfonic acid. Reaction temperature is not especially limited, and generally 0 to 100°C, and preferably 20 to 50°C. Reaction time depends on the reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, kinds of said aminoalkylsulfonic acid to be used, amount of the organic solvent to be used, and concentrations of these substances, and generally 5 minutes to 5 hours. Post-treatment after the reaction may be conducted in accordance with common methods generally conducted in this field. The method of salt exchange for the aminoalkylsulfonate salt represented by the general formula [1’], of the present invention can be used, for example, as a purification process for the aminoalkylsulfonate salt represented by the general formula [1] or an aqueous solution thereof as starting material. Thus, the aminoalkylsulfonate salt (e.g. a sodium salt) can be obtained in high purity as aqueous solution form or ciystal thereof by obtaining the aminoalkylsulfonic acid as crystal from said aminoalkylsulfonate salt (a sodium salt) or an aqueous solution thereof according to the method for production of the present invention, followed by reacting with a hydroxide derived from corresponding salt (in this case, sodium hydroxide). Furthermore, if the aminoalkylsulfonate salt (e.g. a sodium salt) is converted to the aminoalkylsulfonic acid according to the method of production of the present invention, and then treated with a hydroxide' derived from a salt different from that of the starting material (e.g. potassium hydroxide), the aminoalkylsulfonate salt having salt type different from that of the starting material (in this case, potassium salt) can be produced. Thus, by using the method for producing the aminoalkylsulfonic acid of the present invention and further conducting salt exchange reaction of the aminoalkylsulfonate salt, the aminoalkylsulfonate salts having various objective salt types can easily be produced from the sodium aminoalkylsulfonates which can be available comparatively easily and are cheap. The method for producing the aminoalkylsulfonic acid of the present invention can efficiently produce the aminoalkylsulfonic acid using cheap reagents, without having such problems accompanied with conventional method as difficult handling due to use of toxic ethyleneimine or sulfurous acid gas, necessity of expensive equipment due to conducting reaction of alkylamines in heated and pressurized condition and necessity of use of hydrogen peroxide which is difficult to handle in view of safety. Further, conventional methods generate by-products such as ketones, ammonium hydrochlorides and monoethanolamine, which make it difficult to separate an objective aminoalkylsulfonic acid. On the contrary, in the method of production of the present invention, since the organic acid salt as by-products are soluble in the reaction solvent, an objective aminoalkylsulfonic acid can easily be obtained as precipitate in high purity without impurities.
