CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 to U.S. Provisional Application Serial Nos. 61/365,297, filed July 16, 2010; 61/386,941, filed September 27, 2010; and 61/391,360, filed October 8, 2010, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to methods and compositions useful for the detection of retroviruses in a subject or sample. BACKGROUND Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is a recently discovered human gammaretrovirus that resembles a xenotropic MLV, but that is distinguishable from xenotropic MLV in the sequence in its envelope (Urisman et al., PLOS pathogens 2(3):e25, 2006; and Dong et al. PNAS 104:1655, 2007). All isolates so far examined are highly homologous to each other (>98% sequence identity) and allow the distinction from xenotropic MLV. The reason for this sequence conservation is not currently understood. The original infectious clone is called XMRV VP62 (GenBank accession no. EF185282). XMRV was originally described in association with prostate cancer and further connections have been suggested (R. Schlaberg et al. PNAS 2009, doi_10.1073_pnas.0906922106), with 6-23% of prostate cancer patients testing positive. In addition, V.C.Lombardi et al. (Science 2009 doi10.1126/ science.1179052) showed a possible association with chronic fatigue syndrome, with 67% of patients testing positive, compared to 3.7% of normals. Overall estimates of the prevalence in the general population from investigators in the USA range from 2-4%. However several recent studies in Europe have failed to detect XMRV in similar frequencies or similar associations (Fischer et al. Journal of Clinical Virology 43: 277-283 2008; Hohn et al. Retrovirology 6:92 2009; FJM van Kuppeveld et al., BMJ 340:c1018 2010). Fischer et al. found 1 of 105 prostate cancer patients and 1 of 70 control subjects to be XMRV positive in a German study. Hohn et al. screened 589 prostate cancer patients in Germany without detecting a single positive. Van Kuppeveld et al. also failed to detect any DNA or RNA positives in 32 chronic fatigue patients or in 42 matched controls in Holland. Recently another paper from Fischer et al. (Emerg Infect Dis. 2010) showed about 10% positivity in RNA derived from sputum of 162 immunosuppressed patients and 2-3% positivity in sputum RNA from 168 normal patients in a German study. The assays did not appear to be different and no explanation was offered for the discrepancies. The inconsistency of results calls into question the reliability of the current testing methods, in particular in DNA amplification. Following the lead of Lombardi et al. all investigators so far have used nested PCR using XMRV sequence based primers, followed by running the sample on a gel and looking for a visible band. This method is known to be variable in sensitivity and depend on the quality of nucleic acid samples. Detection of XMRV RNA has also been described mainly using the method of Dong et al. PNAS 2007, based on that of Urisman et al. 2006. In this assay RNA is prepared from tissue and/or blood, reverse transcribed to cDNA and the cDNA examined by QPCR with XMRV specific primers. As noted this led to inconsistent results (Enserink et al., Science 329:18-19, 2010). Claims of various sensitivities have been made for such tests, but it is not possible to verify any of these and the assays appear to be incompletely characterized. A PCR based diagnostic screening assay for XMRV in human blood has been recently developed (www[.]vipdx.com), using nested PCR and gel detection of the amplification product (Lombardi et al.), with an estimated sensitivity for the nested DNA PCR around 600 proviral copies/test. In addition the report of Lombardi et al. do not show complete concordance of gag and env detection, with positives in gag and negatives for env observed in some subjects. This was attributed to variability in the assay. In all of the assays developed so far great care has been taken to use primers that will differentiate MLV from XMRV, so that only XMRV is detected. Therefore there is a great need for a reliable and validated assay for XMRV DNA and RNA in accessible samples from volunteers or patients in order to determine the real frequencies of positivity and whether there is linkage to disease. In addition a reliable blood screening assay is not available. Recent data suggest that detection of XMRV in many cases is caused by artifacts (Paprotka T., Science, 333, 97 - 101, 2011) or contamination with mouse DNA (Robinson MJ. et al., Retrovirology, 7:108 doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-7-108, 2010). Furthermore, gene therapy vectors based upon MLV are being used including replication competent MLV-based vectors. For example, a replicating retrovirus based on amphotropic MLV and carrying an extra cytosine deaminase gene as a therapeutic agent for cancer including primary brain cancer leading to glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Tai et al., Mol. Ther., 12:842-851 2005; http:(//)oba.od.nih.gov/oba/RAC/meetings/Jun2009/976_Aghi.pdf; WO2010036986) having been used. An exemplary vector is being developed by Tocagen Inc. (San Diego, CA) and is referred to as Toca 511 (clinical trials.gov trial# NCT01156584). Subsequent to Toca 511 administration, patients are dosed with 5-fluorocytosine that is converted in situ to 5-fluorouracil, a potent anticancer compound. As the virus is generally only able to replicate in the tumor, this results in a very specific anti-cancer effect. In order to determine whether there is replication outside the tumor, for safety and/or for correlation with efficacy assays for detection of proviral DNA in the blood and MLV RNA in the plasma are needed. FDA currently requires follow-up on patients undergoing such investigational therapies with an integrating viral vector for 15 years post-treatment (Guidance for Industry - Supplemental Guidance on Testing for Replication Competent Retrovirus in Retroviral Vector Based Gene Therapy Products and During Follow-up of Patients in Clinical Trials Using Retroviral Vectors: FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research November 2006; http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ Guidances/CellularandGeneTherapy/ucm072961.htm). Assays are needed to accomplish this and a generally accepted marker for risk of disease and disease progression in viral diseases in general and retroviral diseases in particular is the levels over time of virus in the blood or in blood cells (Gurunathan S, Habib RE, et al. Vaccine. 2009;27:1997-2015; Low A., Okeoma CM. et al. Virology 2009; 385: 455-463). On the other hand, replication of the virus in the tumor may leak into the periphery and blood stream and so assays that monitor the appearance and levels of viral sequence in the blood as DNA or RNA can be used to determine whether there is an effective treatment and whether there is a need to modify the treatment protocol, for example to readminister the viral vector or to use adjuvants (such as steroids) that will facilitate the viral replication in the tumor.

Similarly, "comprise," "comprises," "comprising" "include," "includes," and "including" are interchangeable and not intended to be limiting. It is to be further understood that where descriptions of various embodiments use the term "comprising," those skilled in the art would understand that in some specific instances, an embodiment can be alternatively described using language "consisting essentially of' or "consisting of." Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. Although any methods and reagents similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice of the disclosed methods and compositions, the exemplary methods and materials are now described. As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "and," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "an oligonucleotide" includes a plurality of such oligonucleotides and reference to "the polynucleotide" includes reference to one or more polynucleotides known to those skilled in the art, and so forth. The detection of XMRV or MLV related retroviruses by nucleic acid amplification techniques in human or animal tissues, blood or plasma/serum is of use for determining prostate cancer and risk thereof, chronic fatigue system and risk thereof, contamination of blood supply and tissue donation material and in following the status of subjects undergoing therapy with an MLV derived therapeutic virus comprising a heterologous genetic sequence such as, for example, an engineered retroviral replicatog virus based on amphotropic MLV (e.g., Toca 511). For example, the methods and compositions of the disclosure can be used to monitor therapy with an retroviral vector comprising sequences with substantial identity to MLV, in determining if recombination takes place between the therapeutic vector and XMRV or other MLV related natural infections, and for determining if a subject carries XMRV or another MLV related naturally occurring virus. Such assays are also useful for screening the blood supply to exclude subjects that are positive for XMRV or other MLV related retroviruses. Such assays also can be used to determine levels of MLV related virus over time, and provide information when it would be useful to start administering antiretroviral therapies that are also active against MLV such as, for example, AZT (Sakuma et al., Virology, 2009; Powell et al., J.Virol., 73:8813-8816, 1999; G.B.Beck-Engeser, PNAS, 2009). Such assays when used with histopathology samples can be used to determine the presence or absence of XMRV or other MLV related retroviruses in a patients stored sample or to determine the epidemiology of the XMRV or MLV related virus. Such assays can also be used to monitor patients to whom therapeutic vectors based on replicating MLV vectors have been administered. These measurements can be used to track the safety of the therapy over time (e.g., to 15 years and beyond) as high persistent levels (greater than 30,000, 100,000 or 300,000 copies/microgram) of MLV in genomic DNA or greater than 30,000 100,000 or 300,000 RNA copies/ml plasma) or increasing levels of these over time, can be used as a signal to more closely monitor for diseases that could be secondary to a therapy using an gene therapy vector comprising MLV or MLV-related sequences, such as leukemia or to start antiretroviral therapy. However, these measurements can also be used to judge the extent of replication of the MLV or MLV-related vector in a target tissue (i.e., efficacy or susceptibility to successful treatment) because of the possibility of "spill" into the circulatory system. Other uses of these assays for clinical monitoring will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Engineered retroviral vectors that can be monitored include those set forth below: Disclosed herein are assays for detection of target molecules, such as target nucleic acids comprising viral RNA or DNA, using a plurality of nucleic acid amplification techniques including, for example: NAAT (J.D. Fox, J.Clin. Virol. 40 Suppl. 1 S15-S23, 2007), PCR, RT-PCR, qPCR and RT-qPCR with "touchdown" modifications to improve sensitivity to single copy/assay; RNA transcription based assays (e.g. analogous to the HIV-1 Aptiva assay, see http:(//)www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/BloodBloodProducts /ApprovedProducts/LicensedProductsBLAs/BloodDonorScreening/InfectiousDisease/ucm1 49922.htm); the "branched DNA" system (see, e.g.,Anastassopoulou et al., Journal of Virological Methods, 91:67-74, 2001); and further variations in NAAT known to those of skill in the art. Also disclosed are methods using NAAT on nucleic acid samples extracted from histologically fixed samples. The assays provided by the disclosure may be used in many embodiments to detect sequence-specific nucleic acids. Disclosed herein are different embodiments of assays using amplification (e.g., PCR) and enzymatic degradation of RNA/DNA heteroduplexes. Generally, the disclosure provides a method of identifying MLV-related viral polynucleotides in a subject or sample. The disclosure utilizes a combination of primers and probes having identity to conserved regions of MLV-related viruses. The primers are used to amplify target polynucleotides in the sample and probes are then used to visualize or detect the amplified products. Typically the probe is detectably labeled for detection (e.g., fluorescently labeled, luminescently labeled, enzyme conjugated, radionucleotide labled and the like). One advantage of the disclosure is that the primer pairs can be used to amplify MLV-related polynucleotides in a sample such as MLV, XMRV or MLV and XMRV polynucleotides. This is advantageous for the detection of XMRV and naturally occurring variants thereof as well as for detecting MLV and naturally occurring variants thereof (including recombinantly engineered MLV vectors). For example, a combination of primers and probes identified herein can be used to identify or detect XMRV in a sample, tissue or subject by using primer pairs having homology to MLV (e.g., primer pairs that share at least 95% sequence identity between and XMRV viral sequence and an MLV viral sequence) and a probe sequence that is specific for XMRV (e.g., the probe only hybridizes to an amplified product under highly stringent conditions). Primers that share such homology between XMRV and MLV are identified in Figure 5 and Table 2. One utility of this general method is to screen blood and tissue supplies for infection. XMRV has been suggested to be associated with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome. In another utility, a subject may be screened prior to undergoing treatment with a recombinant retroviral vector. By identifying subject that may have circulating viral polynucleotides in the tissue a risk of recombination between the inherent viral polynucleotide and the therapeutic viral polynucleotide may be managed. In another general example, a combination of primers and probes identified herein can be used to identify or detect MLV or MLV-related polynucleotides in a sample, tissue or subject by using primer pairs having homology to MLV (e.g., primer pairs that share at least 95% sequence identity between and XMRV viral sequence and an MLV viral sequence) and a probe sequence that is specific for MLV (e.g., the probe only hybridizes to an amplified product under highly stringent conditions). In another embodiment of the general methods described herein, the methods provide useful diagnostics for monitoring patients after delivery of a replication competent MLV-related viral vector. The method can be used to monitor a subject following delivery of the vector on a routine basis (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly) for as long as a treating physician deems necessary.

Any number of different alignment programs can be used to identified regions of identity between any combination of the foregoing MLV-related genomes. Other genomes will be readily identified by using a BLAST algorithm or other similar algorithm to identify sequences having homology/identity to the foregoing sequences. In some embodiments the disclosure relates to a method of detecting MLV-related viruses including XMRV in a sample comprising contacting the sample with a nucleic acid sequence that hybridizes to all or a portion of XMRV nucleic acid sequence under conditions in which a hybridization complex can occur between the detecting nucleic acid sequence and the XMRV nucleic acid sequence. In a related embodiment, the XMRV specific primers are 95% or more identical to SEQ ID Nos:1 and 2, and the probe is 95% or more identical to SEQ ID NO:3 (XMRV gag). In a further related embodiment the XMRV specific primers are 95% or more identical to SEQ ID NOs:4 and 5 and the probe is 95% or more identical to SEQ ID NO:6 (XMRV env). In yet a further embodiment, the method uses a combination of primers and probes (e.g., SEQ ID NO:1, 2, 4 and 5 and probes comprising SEQ ID NO:3 and 6). In another embodiment, the disclosure relates to a method of detecting XMRV or other MLV related nucleic acids in a sample by using primers and probes that are not specific to XMRV but rather are shared between XMRV and other related strains of MLV. In a related embodiment the MLV/XMRV specific primers are SEQ ID NOs:7 and 8 and the probe is SEQ ID NO:9 (Pol 2 primers and probe; other primers and probes are set forth in Table 1, 2, 3, and 4 below). In a further related embodiment, the MLV/XMRV specific primers are SEQ ID NOs:10 and 11 and the probe is SEQ ID NO:12 (pol1 primer and probe). In a further related embodiment, other sequences can be identified that are common to XMRV and MLV (see the BLAST sequence comparison of two genomes of XMRV and MLV, Figure 5, where perfect sequence homologies of 20 or more bases are underlined/highlighted). Such homologous sequences (or shorter runs of homology down to 15 bases) can be used to select primers and probes. Alternatively, primers and probes can be chosen using programs that compare sequences and suggest common primers and probes. Such programs are usually designed to look for related genes in different species, and can be used to design QPCR reagents for molecules such as MLV and XMRV with significant but incomplete homology. An example of such a program is Primaclade http:(//)www.umsl.edu/services/kellogg/primaclade/FAQ.html. An oligonucleotide probe or a primer refers to a nucleic acid molecule of between 8 and 2000 nucleotides in length, or is specified to be about 6 and 1000 nucleotides in length. More particularly, the length of these oligonucleotides can range from about 8, 10, 15, 20, or 30 to 100 nucleotides, but will typically be about 10 to 50 (e.g., 15 to 30 nucleotides). The appropriate length for oligonucleotides in assays of the disclosure under a particular set of conditions may be empirically determined by one of skill in the art. As used herein a primer or probe consisting of at least 95% identity to a reference sequence means that the sequence comprises a sequence that is the same number of oligonucleotides in length, but may differ in nucleotides by 5% from the reference sequence. In addition, a primer or probe consisting of at least 95% identity to a reference sequence and having from 1-10 additional or deleted nucleotides at the 5' and/or 3' end of the oligonucleotide means that the sequence differs by 1 to up to 20 nucleotides in length from the reference sequence and which also differs 5% or less in identity. Accordingly, any primer probe disclosed herein by consist of a reference sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1-21 or sequences set forth in Table 1 and 2); can consist of a sequence that is 95% of greater in identity to a reference sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1-21 or sequences set forth in Table 1 and 2); or can consist of a sequence that is at least 95% identical and has an additional 1-20 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 nucleotides at the 5' and/or 3' end of the reference sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1-21 or sequence set forth in Table 1 and 2). Oligonucleotide primers and probes can be prepared by any suitable method, including direct chemical synthesis and a number of probe systems with derivatized oligonucleotides are available to hybridize to and to detect amplified product, normally by fluorescence change on binding to the probe target. The oligonucleotide primers and probes can contain conventional nucleotides, as well as any of a variety of analogs. For example, the term "nucleotide", as used herein, refers to a compound comprising a nucleotide base linked to the C-1' carbon of a sugar, such as ribose, arabinose, xylose, and pyranose, and sugar analogs thereof. The term nucleotide also encompasses nucleotide analogs. The sugar may be substituted or unsubstituted. Substituted ribose sugars include, but are not limited to, those riboses in which one or more of the carbon atoms, for example the 2'-carbon atom, is substituted with one or more of the same or different Cl, F, --R, --OR, --NR2 or halogen groups, where each R is independently H, C1-C6 alkyl or C5-C14 aryl. Exemplary riboses include, but are not limited to, 2'-(C1-C6)alkoxyribose, 2'-(C5-C14)aryloxyribose, 2',3'-didehydroribose, 2'-deoxy-3'-haloribose, 2'-deoxy-3'-fluororibose, 2'-deoxy-3'-chlororibose, 2'-deoxy-3'-aminoribose, 2'-deoxy-3'-(C1-C6)alkylribose, 2'-deoxy-3'-(C1-C6)alkoxyribose and 2-deoxy-3'-(C5-C14)aryloxyribose, ribose, 2'-deoxyribose, 2',3'-dideoxyribose, 2'-haloribose, 2'-fluororibose, 2'-chlororibose, and 2'-alkylribose, e.g., 2'-O-methyl, 4'-α-anomeric nucleotides, 1'-α-anomeric nucleotides, 2'-4'- and 3'-4'-linked and other "locked" or "LNA", bicyclic sugar modifications (see, e.g., PCT published application nos. WO 98/22489, WO 98/39352; and WO 99/14226). Modifications at the 2'- or 3'-position of ribose include, but are not limited to, hydrogen, hydroxy, methoxy, ethoxy, allyloxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, methoxyethyl, alkoxy, phenoxy, azido, amino, alkylamino, fluoro, chloro and bromo. Nucleotides include, but are not limited to, the natural D optical isomer, as well as the L optical isomer forms (see, e.g., Garbesi (1993) Nucl. Acids Res. 21:4159-65; Fujimori (1990) J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 112:7435; Urata, (1993) Nucleic Acids Symposium Ser. No. 29:69-70). When the nucleotide base is purine, e.g. A or G, the ribose sugar is attached to the N9-position of the nucleotide base. When the nucleotide base is pyrimidine, e.g. C, T or U, the pentose sugar is attached to the N1-position of the nucleotide base, except for pseudouridines, in which the pentose sugar is attached to the C5 position of the uracil nucleotide base (see, e.g., Kornberg and Baker, (1992) DNA Replication, 2nd Ed., Freeman, San Francisco, Calif.). The 3' end of the probe can be functionalized with a capture or detectable label to assist in detection of a target polynucleotide or of a polymorphism. Any of the oligonucleotides or nucleic acids of the disclosure can be labeled by incorporating a detectable label measurable by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, or chemical means. For example, such labels can comprise radioactive substances (e.g.,32P, 35S, 3H, 125I), fluorescent dyes (e.g., 5-bromodesoxyuridin, fluorescein, acetylaminofluorene, digoxigenin), molecular quenchers (e.g. blackhole, molecular beacons), biotin, nanoparticles, and others know tothose skilled in the art. Such oligonucleotides are typically labeled at their 3' and/or 5' ends. A probe refers to a molecule which can detectably distinguish changes in gene expression or can distinguish between target molecules differing in structure. Detection can be accomplished in a variety of different ways depending on the type of probe used and the type of target molecule. Thus, for example, detection may be based on discrimination of activity levels of the target molecule, but typically is based on detection of specific binding. Examples of such specific binding include nucleic acid probe hybridization. Thus, for example, probes can include nucleic acid hybridization probes (including primers useful for polynucleotide amplification and/or detection). Thus, in one embodiment, the detection of the presence or absence of the at least one target polynucleotide involves contacting a biological sample with a probe or primer pair. Typically an oligonucleotide probe or primer pair, where the probe/primers hybridizes with a form of a target polynucleotide in the biological sample containing a complementary sequence, undergoes hybridization using hybridization selective conditions. Such an oligonucleotide probe can include one or more nucleic acid analogs, labels or other substituents or moieties so long as the base-pairing function is retained. The disclosure provides methods and systems for identifying and quantifying the amount of a given nucleic acid sequence in a given sample, usually down to a single copy per sample. Furthermore, the methods and systems of the disclosure provide sequence specific detection useful for differentiating/identifying related genomic sequences and provide a detectable signal when the correct target sequence is present. The disclosure provides various embodiments of the invention. Methods known in the art can be used to quantitatively measure the amount of a nucleic acid present in a sample. Examples of such methods include quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and other NAAT technologies as described above. In one embodiment, a method for detecting a specific viral polynucleotide is provided by the disclosure. Such a method can include the use of primers, probes, enzymes, and other reagents for the preparation, detection, and quantitation of a viral polynucleotide (e.g., by PCR, by Northern blot and the like). The primers listed in SEQ ID NOs: 1-12 are particularly suited for use in profiling using RT-PCR based on a viral polynucleotide. Other primers (sense and antisense) and probes are provided in Table 2. One of skill in the art can readily identity in Table 2, the combinations of primer/probes useful for detection of an MLV, MLV-related or XMRV viral sequence. Although the disclosure provides particular primers and probes, those of skill in the art will readily recognize that additional probes and primers can be generated based upon the polynucleotide sequences provided by the disclosure (see, also, for example, Figure 5). Referring to the primers and probes exemplified herein, a series of primers were designed to amplify portions of a murine retroviral (MLV) genome. The primer/probe sets listed in SEQ ID NOs: 1-12 were designed, selected, and tested accordingly (see Examples). Though a number of detection schemes for detecting amplicons are contemplated, as will be discussed in more detail below, one method for detection of polynucleotide amplicons is fluorescence spectroscopy, and therefore labels suited to fluorescence spectroscopy are desirable for detecting polynucleotide. In a related form of detection the amplicon polynucleotide is detected without a hybridization probe but directly with a fluorophore that binds DNA and fluoresces at a wavelength different from that of the free reagent. An example of such a fluorescent label is SYBR Green, though numerous related fluorescent molecules are known including, without limitation, DAPI, Cy3, Cy3.5, Cy5, CyS.5, Cy7, umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin. In one embodiment of the disclosure, an oligonucleotide primer pair is used to amplify a polynucleotide corresponding to the pol gene of a murine retrovirus. Primers comprising SEQ ID NOs:7 and 8 (forward and reverse primers, respectively) are used to amplify the region of the pol gene. The amplified region can then be detected using a probe (SEQ ID NO:9), which specifically hybridizes to the amplified polynucleotide. The probe can be labeled with any number of detectable labels as described herein. The foregoing primers (SEQ ID NOs:7, 8 and 10, 11) with the appropriate probes (SEQ ID NOs:9 and 12, respectively) can be used to detect the presence of, for example, Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) and Xenotropic Murine Retrovirus (XMRV). As described elsewhere herein identifying the presence of MLV and/or XMRV is useful for the determination of a therapeutic gene delivery and cancer treatment regimen. In another embodiment of the disclosure, an oligonucleotide primer pair is used to amplify a polynucleotide corresponding to the gag gene of a XMRV. Primers comprising SEQ ID NOs:1 and 2 (forward and reverse primers, respectively) are used to amplify the region of the gag gene of XMRV. The amplified region can then be detected using a probe (SEQ ID NO:3) which specifically hybridizes to the amplified polynucleotide. The probe can be labeled with any number of detectable labels as described herein. This combination of primers and probes is useful for specifically identifying the presence of an XMRV infection or contamination. In another embodiment of the disclosure, an oligonucleotide primer pair is used to amplify a polynucleotide corresponding to the LTR of an MLV vector. Primers comprising SEQ ID NOs:16 and 17 (forward and reverse primers, respectively) are used to amplify the region of the LTR of an MLV vector (e.g., Toca511). The amplified region can then be detected using a probe (SEQ ID NO: 18) which specifically hybridizes to the amplified polynucleotide. The probe can be labeled with any number of detectable labels as described herein. This combination of primers and probes is useful for specifically identifying the presence of a retroviral vector during gene delivery monitoring. In another embodiment of the disclosure, an oligonucleotide primer pair is used to amplify a polynucleotide corresponding to a polynucleotide encoding a cytosine deaminase. Primers comprising SEQ ID NOs:19 and 20 (forward and reverse primers, respectively) are used to amplify the region of the a cytosine deaminase delivered using an MLV vector (e.g., Toca511). The amplified region can then be detected using a probe (SEQ ID NO:21) which specifically hybridizes to the amplified polynucleotide. The probe can be labeled with any number of detectable labels as described herein. This combination of primers and probes is useful for specifically identifying the presence of a retroviral vector during gene delivery monitoring. The primers (SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2) and probe (SEQ ID NO:3) can be used to detect the presence of XMRV. As described elsewhere herein identifying the presence of XMRV is useful for the determination of a therapeutic gene delivery, cancer treatment regimen and blood supply screening. In another embodiment of the disclosure, an oligonucleotide primer pair is used to amplify a polynucleotide corresponding to the env gene of a XMRV. Primers comprising SEQ ID NOs:4 and 5 (forward and reverse primers, respectively) are used to amplify the region of the env gene of XMRV. The amplified region can then be detected using a probe (SEQ ID NO:6) which specifically hybridizes to the amplified polynucleotide. The probe can be labeled with any number of detectable labels as described herein. This combination of primers and probes is useful for specifically identifying the presence of an XMRV infection or contamination. The foregoing primers (SEQ ID NOs:4 and 5) and probe (SEQ ID NO:6) can be used to detect the presence of XMRV. As described elsewhere herein identifying the presence of XMRV is useful for the determination of a therapeutic gene delivery, cancer treatment regimen and screening the blood supply. Any of the oligonucleotide primers and probes of the disclosure can be immobilized on a solid support. Solid supports are known to those skilled in the art and include the walls of wells of a reaction tray, test tubes, polystyrene beads, magnetic beads, nitrocellulose strips, membranes, microparticles such as latex particles, glass and the like. The solid support is not critical and can be selected by one skilled in the art. Thus, latex particles, microparticles, magnetic or non-magnetic beads, membranes, plastic tubes, walls of microtiter wells, glass or silicon chips and the like are all suitable examples. Suitable methods for immobilizing oligonucleotides on a solid phase include ionic, hydrophobic, covalent interactions and the like. The solid support can be chosen for its intrinsic ability to attract and immobilize the capture reagent. The oligonucleotide probes or primers of the disclosure can be attached to or immobilized on a solid support individually or in groups of about 2-10,000 distinct oligonucleotides of the disclosure to a single solid support. A substrate comprising a plurality of oligonucleotide primers or probes of the disclosure may be used either for detecting or amplifying targeted sequences. The oligonucleotide probes and primers of the disclosure can be attached in contiguous regions or at random locations on the solid support. Alternatively the oligonucleotides of the disclosure may be attached in an ordered array wherein each oligonucleotide is attached to a distinct region of the solid support which does not overlap with the attachment site of any other oligonucleotide. Typically, such oligonucleotide arrays are "addressable" such that distinct locations are recorded and can be accessed as part of an assay procedure. The knowledge of the location of oligonucleotides on an array make "addressable" arrays useful in hybridization assays. For example, the oligonucleotide probes can be used in an oligonucleotide chip such as those marketed by Affymetrix and described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854; PCT publications WO 90/15070 and 92/10092, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. These arrays can be produced using mechanical synthesis methods or light directed synthesis methods which incorporate a combination of photolithographic methods and solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis. The immobilization of arrays of oligonucleotides on solid supports has been rendered possible by the development of a technology generally referred to as "Very Large Scale Immobilized Polymer Synthesis" in which probes are immobilized in a high density array on a solid surface of a chip (see, e.g.,U.S. Patent Nos. 5,143,854; and 5,412,087 and in PCT Publications WO 90/15070, WO 92/10092 and WO 95/11995, each of which are incorporated herein by reference), which describe methods for forming oligonucleotide arrays through techniques such as light-directed synthesis techniques. In another embodiment, an array of oligonucleotides complementary to subsequences of the target gene (for example yeast cytosine deaminase (CD) or a version of CD optimized for expression in human cells) is used to determine the identity of the target, measure its amount and the like. Hybridization techniques can also be used to identify the viral polynucleotides in a subject or sample and thereby determine or predict cross reactivity, chances of recombination or a treatment regimen using a gene delivery vector comprising a recombinant MLV vector. The hybridization reactions may be carried out in a solid support (e.g., membrane or chip) format, in which, for example, a probe (e.g., SEQ ID NO:3, 6 and/or 9) are immobilized on nitrocellulose or nylon membranes and probed with amplified preparations of nucleic acids obtained, for example, from PCR using primers comprising SEQ ID NO:1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 and/or 14 of the disclosure. Any of the known hybridization formats may be used, including Southern blots, slot blots, "reverse" dot blots, solution hybridization, solid support based sandwich hybridization, bead- based, silicon chip-based and microtiter well-based hybridization formats. Hybridization of an oligonucleotide probe to a target polynucleotide may be performed with both entities in solution, or such hybridization may be performed when either the oligonucleotide or the target polynucleotide is covalently or noncovalently affixed to a solid support. Attachment to a solid support may be mediated, for example, by antibody-antigen interactions, poly-L-Lysine, streptavidin or avidin-biotin, salt bridges, hydrophobic interactions, chemical linkages, UV cross-linking baking, etc. Oligonucleotides may be synthesized directly on the solid support or attached to the solid support subsequent to synthesis. The solid support may be treated, coated or derivatized to facilitate the immobilization of the specific oligonucleotide. Hybridization assays based on oligonucleotide arrays rely on the differences in hybridization stability of short oligonucleotides to perfectly matched and mismatched target variants. Each DNA chip can contain thousands to millions of individual synthetic DNA probes arranged in a grid-like pattern and miniaturized to the size of a dime or smaller. Such a chip may comprise oligonucleotides representative of both a wild-type and variant sequences. Oligonucleotides of the disclosure can be designed to specifically hybridize to a target region of a polynucleotide. As used herein, specific hybridization means the oligonucleotide forms an anti-parallel double-stranded structure with the target region under certain hybridizing conditions, while failing to form such a structure when incubated with a different target polynucleotide or another region in the polynucleotide or with a polynucleotide lacking the desired locus under the same hybridizing conditions. Typically, the oligonucleotide specifically hybridizes to the target region under conventional high stringency conditions. A nucleic acid molecule such as an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide is said to be a "perfect" or "complete" complement of another nucleic acid molecule if every nucleotide of one of the molecules is complementary to the nucleotide at the corresponding position of the other molecule. A nucleic acid molecule is "substantially complementary" to another molecule if it hybridizes to that molecule with sufficient stability to remain in a duplex form under conventional low-stringency conditions. Conventional hybridization conditions are described, for example, in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y. (1989), and in Haymes et al., Nucleic Acid Hybridization, A Practical Approach, IRL Press, Washington, D. C. (1985). While perfectly complementary oligonucleotides are used in most assays for detecting target polynucleotides or polymorphisms, departures from complete complementarity are contemplated where such departures do not prevent the molecule from specifically hybridizing to the target region. For example, an oligonucleotide primer may have a non-complementary fragment at its 5' or 3' end, with the remainder of the primer being complementary to the target region. Those of skill in the art are familiar with parameters that affect hybridization; such as temperature, probe or primer length and composition, buffer composition and salt concentration and can readily adjust these parameters to achieve specific hybridization of a nucleic acid to a target sequence. A variety of hybridization conditions may be used in the disclosure, including high, moderate and low stringency conditions; see for example Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d Edition, 1989, and Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, ed. Ausubel, et al., hereby incorporated by reference. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology--Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes, "Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays" (1993). Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5-10°C lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength, pH and nucleic acid concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium (as the target sequences are present in excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium). Stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M sodium ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30° C for short probes (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60° C for long probes (e.g., greater than 50 nucleotides). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of helix destabilizing agents such as formamide. The hybridization conditions may also vary when a non- ionic backbone, i.e., PNA is used, as is known in the art. In addition, cross-linking agents may be added after target binding to cross-link, i.e., covalently attach, the two strands of the hybridization complex. Methods and compositions of the disclosure are useful for diagnosing or determining the presence of contamination or infection in a sample or subject, respectively. Such tests can be performed using DNA or RNA samples collected from blood, cells, biopsies, tissue scrapings, tissue culture, or other cellular materials. As will be appreciated by those in the art, target polynucleotides can be obtained from samples including, but not limited to, bodily fluids (e.g., blood, urine, serum, lymph, saliva, anal and vaginal secretions, perspiration and semen) of virtually any organism, with mammalian samples common to the methods of the disclosure and human samples being typical. The sample may comprise individual cells, including primary cells (including bacteria) and cell lines including, but not limited to, tumor cells of all types (particularly melanoma, myeloid leukemia, carcinomas of the lung, breast, ovaries, colon, kidney, prostate, pancreas and testes); cardiomyocytes; endothelial cells; epithelial cells; lymphocytes (T-cell and B cell); mast cells; eosinophils; vascular intimal cells; hepatocytes; leukocytes including mononuclear leukocytes; stem cells such as haemopoetic, neural, skin, lung, kidney, liver and myocyte stem cells; osteoclasts; chondrocytes and other connective tissue cells; keratinocytes; melanocytes; liver cells; kidney cells; and adipocytes. Suitable cells also include known research cells, including, but not limited to, Jurkat T cells, NIH3T3 cells, CHO, Cos, 923, HeLa, SiHa, WI-38, Weri-1, MG-63, and the like (see the ATCC cell line catalog, hereby expressly incorporated by reference). Other methods to amplify and identify viral infection or contamination by MLV or XMRV will be recognized in the art and can be utilized in combination with the primers and probes identified herein. For example, one of skill in the art will recognize that Branched DNA, Hybrid Capture Assays, PCR (including RT, nested, multiplex, Real Time), Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, transcription mediated amplification, strand displacement amplification, Ligase Chain Reaction, Cleavase-invader technology and cycling probe technology can be used with the oligonucleotides of the disclosure. A target polynucleotide (e.g., a virus polynucleotide or gene) may be amplified using any oligonucleotide-directed amplification method including, but not limited to, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,188), ligase chain reaction (LCR) (Barany et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:189-93 (1991); WO 90/01069), and oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA) (Landegren et al., Science 241:1077-80 (1988)). Other known nucleic acid amplification procedures may be used to amplify the target region (s) including transcription-based amplification systems (U.S. Pat. No. 5,130,238; European Patent No. EP 329,822; U.S. Pat. No. 5,169,766; WO 89/06700) and isothermal methods (Walker et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:392-6 (1992)). Ligase Chain Reaction (LCR) techniques can be used and are particularly useful for detection of single or multiple (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) nucleotide differences between similar polynucleotides. LCR occurs only when the oligonucleotides are correctly base-paired. The Ligase Chain Reaction (LCR), which utilizes the thermostable Taq ligase for ligation amplification, is useful for interrogating loci of a gene. LCR differs from PCR because it amplifies the probe molecule rather than producing amplicon through polymerization of nucleotides. Two probes are used per each DNA strand and are ligated together to form a single probe. LCR uses both a DNA polymerase enzyme and a DNA ligase enzyme to drive the reaction. Like PCR, LCR requires a thermal cycler to drive the reaction and each cycle results in a doubling of the target nucleic acid molecule. LCR can have greater specificity than PCR. The elevated reaction temperatures permit the ligation reaction to be conducted with high stringency. Where a mismatch occurs, ligation cannot be accomplished. For example, a probe based upon a target polynucleotide is synthesized in two fragments and annealed to the template with possible difference at the boundary of the two primer fragments. A ligase ligates the two primers if they match exactly to the template sequence. In one embodiment, the two hybridization probes are designed each with a target specific portion. The first hybridization probe is designed to be substantially complementary to a first target domain of a target polynucleotide (e.g., a polynucleotide fragment) and the second hybridization probe is substantially complementary to a second target domain of a target polynucleotide (e.g., a polynucleotide fragment). In general, each target specific sequence of a hybridization probe is at least about 5 nucleotides long, with sequences of about 15 to 30 being typical and 20 being especially common. In one embodiment, the first and second target domains are directly adjacent, e.g., they have no intervening nucleotides. In this embodiment, at least a first hybridization probe is hybridized to the first target domain and a second hybridization probe is hybridized to the second target domain. If perfect complementarity exists at the junction, a ligation structure is formed such that the two probes can be ligated together to form a ligated probe. If this complementarity does not exist (due to mismatch), no ligation structure is formed and the probes are not ligated together to an appreciable degree. This may be done using heat cycling, to allow the ligated probe to be denatured off the target polynucleotide such that it may serve as a template for further reactions. The method may also be done using three hybridization probes or hybridization probes that are separated by one or more nucleotides, if dNTPs and a polymerase are added (this is sometimes referred to as "Genetic Bit" analysis). Quantitative PCR and digital PCR can be used to measure the level of a polynucleotide in a sample. Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (digital PCR, dPCR or dePCR) can be used to directly quantify and clonally amplify nucleic acids including DNA, cDNA or RNA. Digital PCR amplifies nucleic acids by temperature cycling of a nucleic acid molecule with a DNA polymerase. The reaction is typically carried out in the dispersed phase of an emulsion capturing each individual nucleic acid molecule present in a sample within many separate chambers or regions prior to PCR amplification. A count of chambers containing detectable levels of PCR end-product is a direct measure of the absolute nucleic acids quantity. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a modification of the polymerase chain reaction and real-time quantitative PCR are useful for measuring the amount of DNA after each cycle of PCR by use of fluorescent markers or other detectable labels. Quantitative PCR methods use the addition of a competitor RNA (for reverse-transcriptase PCR) or DNA in serial dilutions or co-amplification of an internal control to ensure that the amplification is stopped while in the exponential growth phase. Modifications of PCR and PCR techniques are routine in the art and there are commercially available kits useful for PCR amplification. A probe or primer of the disclosure can be associated with a detectable label. A signaling component can include any label that can be detected optically, electronically, radioactively and the like. A nucleic acid analog may serve as the signaling component. By "label" or "detectable label" is meant a moiety that allows detection. In one embodiment, the detection label is a primary label. A primary label is one that can be directly detected, such as a fluorophore. In general, labels fall into three classes: a) isotopic labels, which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes; b) magnetic, electrical, thermal labels; and c) colored or luminescent dyes. Common labels include chromophores or phosphors but are typically fluorescent dyes. Suitable dyes for use in the disclosure include, but are not limited to; fluorescent lanthamide complexes, including those of Europium and Terbium, fluorescein, rhodamine, tetramethylrhodamine, eosin, erythrosin, coumarin, methyl-coumarins, quantum dots (also referred to as "nanocrystals"), pyrene, Malacite green, stilbene, Lucifer Yellow, Cascade Blue™, Texas Red, Cy dyes (Cy3, Cy5, and the like), Alexa dyes, phycoerythin, bodipy, and others described in the 6th Edition of the Molecular Probes Handbook by Richard P. Haugland, hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Such a detectable label may be a radioactive label or may be a luminescent, fluorescent of enzyme label. Indirect detection processes typically comprise probes covalently labeled with a hapten or ligand such as digoxigenin (DIG) or biotin. In one embodiment, following the hybridization step, the target-probe duplex is detected by an antibody- or streptavidin-enzyme complex. Enzymes commonly used in DNA diagnostics are horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. Direct detection methods include the use of fluorophor-labeled oligonucleotides, lanthanide chelate-labeled oligonucleotides or oligonucleotide-enzyme conjugates. Examples of fluorophor labels are fluorescein, rhodamine and phthalocyanine dyes. It will be understood that embodiments of the invention include probes having fluorescent dye molecules, fluorescent compounds, or other fluorescent moieties. A dye molecule may fluoresce, or be induced to fluoresce upon excitation by application of suitable excitation energy (e.g., electromagnetic energy of suitable wavelength), and may also absorb electromagnetic energy ("quench") emitted by another dye molecule or fluorescent moiety. Any suitable fluorescent dye molecule, compound or moiety may be used in the practice of the invention. For example, suitable fluorescent dyes, compounds, and other fluorescent moieties include fluorescein, 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM), 2',4', 1,4,-tetrachlorofluorescein (TET), 2',4',5',7',1,4-hexachlorofluorescein (HEX), 2',7'-dimethoxy-4',5'-dichloro-6-carboxyrhodamine (JOE), 2'-chloro-5'-fluoro-7',8'-fused phenyl-1,4-dichloro-6-carboxyfluorescein (NED) and 2'-chloro-7'-phenyl-1,4-dichloro-6-carboxyfluorescein (VIC), cyanine dyes (e.g., Cy.sup.3, Cy.sup.5, Cy.sup.9, nitrothiazole blue (NTB)), Cys3, FAM.TM., tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA), tetrapropano-6-carboxyrhodamine (ROX), dipyrromethene boron fluoride (Bodipy), dichloro-fluorescein, dichloro-rhodamine, fluorescein thiosemicarbazide (FTC), sulforhodamine 101 acid chloride (Texas Red), phycoerythrin, rhodamine, carboxytetramethylrhodamine, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), an indopyras dye, pyrenyloxytrisulfonic acid (Cascade Blue), 514 carboxylic acid (Oregon Green), eosin, erythrosin, pyridyloxazole, benzoxadiazole, aminonapthalene, pyrene, maleimide, a coumarin, 4-fluoro-7-nitrobenofurazan (NBD), 4-amino-N-[3-(vinylsulfonyl)-phenyl]naphthalimide-3,6-disulfonate) (Lucifer Yellow), DABCYL, DABSYL, anthraquinone, malachite green, nitrothiazole, and nitroimidazole compounds, propidium iodide, porphyrins, lanthamide cryptates, lanthamide chelates, derivatives and analogs thereof (e.g., 5-carboxy isomers of fluorescein dyes), and other fluorescent dyes and fluorescent molecules and compounds. An oligonucleotide according to the methods of the invention may be labeled at the 5' end or the 3' end of at least one subunit of the probe. In embodiments, oligonucleotides may be labeled at both the 5' end and the 3' end. Alternatively, at least one subunit of the probe may be labeled internally, having at least one, and, in embodiments, more than one, internal label. In embodiments, an oligonucleotide may be labeled at an end and may be labeled internally. The oligonucleotides themselves are synthesized using techniques that are also well known in the art. Methods for preparing oligonucleotides of specific sequence are known in the art, and include, for example, cloning and restriction digest analysis of appropriate sequences and direct chemical synthesis, including, for example, the phosphotriester method described by Narang et al., 1979, Methods in Enzymology, 68:190, the phosphodiester method disclosed by Brown et al., 1979, Methods in Enzymology, 68:109, the diethylphosphoramidate method disclosed in Beaucage et al., 1981, Tetrahedron Letters, 22:1859, and the solid support method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,066, or by other chemical methods using a commercial automated oligonucleotide synthesizer. Modified linkages also may be included, for example phosphorothioates. Examples of detection modes contemplated for the disclosed methods include, but are not limited to, spectroscopic techniques, such as fluorescence and UV-Vis spectroscopy, scintillation counting, and mass spectroscopy. Complementary to these modes of detection, examples of labels for the purpose of detection and quantitation used in these methods include, but are not limited to, chromophoric labels, scintillation labels, and mass labels. The expression levels of polynucleotides and polypeptides measured using these methods may be normalized to a control established for the purpose of the targeted determination. Label detection will be based upon the type of label used in the particular assay. Such detection methods are known in the art. For example, radioisotope detection can be performed by autoradiography, scintillation counting or phosphor imaging. For hapten or biotin labels, detection is with an antibody or streptavidin bound to a reporter enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase, which is then detected by enzymatic means. For fluorophor or lanthanide-chelate labels, fluorescent signals may be measured with spectrofluorimeters with or without time-resolved mode or using automated microtitre plate readers. With enzyme labels, detection is by color or dye deposition (p-nitropheny phosphate or 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium for alkaline phosphatase and 3,3'- diaminobenzidine-NiCh for horseradish peroxidase), fluorescence (e.g., 4-methyl umbelliferyl phosphate for alkaline phosphatase) or chemiluminescence (the alkaline phosphatase dioxetane substrates LumiPhos 530 from Lumigen Inc., Detroit Mich, or AMPPD and CSPD from Tropix, Inc.). Chemiluminescent detection may be carried out with X-ray or polaroid film or by using single photon counting luminometers. The methods, compositions, systems and devices disclosed herein find use in the identification and quantization of a target DNA or RNA polynucleotide in a sample, such as in a pool of sequences including one or more target sequences, which may be unrelated polynucleotides. Quantization of specific nucleic acid samples may be achieved by comparing the total signal (fluorescent or otherwise) obtained during the assay with a standard curve of known polynucleotide target concentrations. Specific examples of applications include the detection of pathogenic viruses through the detection of their biomolecules such as DNA or RNA which are indicative of the presence of said targets. Assays having features of the invention may be used to detect and identify the presence of specific DNA sequences and may be used in assays for diagnosis of many types of infection and disease. These assays are suitable for use on cell lysates, and contaminated samples as well. Since many clinical samples are rich with contaminants, it is advantageous that the described assays herein work under these conditions. Although many methods are currently available for DNA extraction and purification from tissues, assays such as those disclosed herein (QIAGEN kits, etc.), which are proficient in analyzing and working with contaminated samples, are very valuable and increases the robustness of the assay. For clinical sample use with the disclosed assays, sample preparation kits may be used. For example, samples suspected of containing pathogenic DNA may be used. Exemplary kits and protocols that can be used include the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit provided by Qiagen. This kit allows DNA isolation from clinical samples in roughly 1 hour. Other methods for sample preparation are available from suppliers such as Promega. Polynucleotides may be prepared from samples using known techniques. For example, the sample may be treated to lyse a cell comprising the target polynucleotide, using known lysis buffers, sonication techniques, electroporation, and the like. Many methods for cell lysis are common knowledge for those trained in the art. The following Examples are provided to illustrate and do not limit the invention.

Example 2: Preparation of genomic DNA from blood and other tissues from mammals including human and canines for PCR testing. The XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus) qPCR assay is performed to quantify DNA. Total DNA extraction from the specimens samples is generated by standard means such as the use of commercially available kits (QIAGEN DNA blood mini kit, QIAGEN DNA Tissue kit, Promega DNA Tissue Kit, Promega DNA Cell Kit). A quantitation curve is established with 8 non-zero samples comprising of serial dilutions of defined copy number of reference plasmid to generate a Ct value versus copy number correlation. Linear regression analysis generates an equation which is used to calculate the copy number in the sample. Quantitative curves generation are shown for XMRV gag (Figure 8), XMRV env (Figure 9), XMRV pol2 (Figure 10). Example 3: Preparation of plasma from humans and dogs for RT-PCR testing. Blood was collected in blood collection tubes, and serum or plasma prepared from the whole blood by conventional means. The XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus) RT-PCR assay is performed to quantify RNA from biological samples, such as whole blood and plasma, without the need for RNA extraction. The assay employs a two-step amplification process with the initial step consisting of the distribution of 2 µL of experimental sample directly into a cDNA reaction mix. Following completion of the reverse transcriptase (RT) cDNA synthesis, a 2 µL aliquot is removed, transferred into a qPCR reaction mix and a qPCR protocol is performed. A quantitation curve is established with 6 non-zero samples comprising of serial dilutions of defined copy number of reference vector to generate a Ct value versus copy number correlation. Linear regression analysis generates an equation which is used to calculate the copy number in the sample. Quantitative curves generation are shown in Figure 15. Example 4: Standardization and Validation of QPCR DNA assays. A series of experiments were performed as outlined below: 1) To optimize the cycling parameters of the quantitative PCR (qPCR) protocol for XMRV detection including primer and probe concentrations and annealing temperature.2) To assess detection sensitivity in spiked human whole blood genomic DNA (gDNA) targeted with the XMRV env, XMRV gag and XMRV pol2 primer/probe sets using qPCR.3) To assess the use of an additional set of three pre-cycling steps (defined as a stage) in the qPCR protocol with respect to detection sensitivity.4) To assess for variance in XMRV detection sensitivity from independent sources of human whole blood.5) To assess for recovery of 22Rv1 XMRV positive control spiked into human whole blood gDNA. Assay Design a. Optimization of cycling parameters for the qPCR protocol. A matrix of primers and probe were made up in various concentration combinations and were used to target the appropriate XMRV plasmid (pUC57 XMRV gag, pET28b XMRV env or pAZ3-emd pol2) containing the gene of interest. The choice of optimal primer concentrations were made based on comparisons of Ct value, standard deviation and relative fluorescence units (RFU). SYBR Green was used for the primer concentration optimization qPCR assay and TaqMan was used for the probe concentration optimization assay. Annealing temperature optimization was carried out by performing a qPCR annealing temperature gradient ranging from 50°C to 65°C. Plasmids specific for the gene of interest were targeted with the appropriate XMRV primer sets. b. Detection sensitivity in human whole blood gDNA spiked with plasmid DNA and targeted with XMRV env, XMRV gag or XMRV pol2 primer/probe sets using qPCR. Genomic DNA extracted from human whole blood was spiked with known copy numbers of plasmid DNA containing the gene of interest. Serial log dilutions of the spiked gDNA were made and qPCR was performed. The samples were targeted with XMRV env (Figure 9), XMRV gag (Figure 8) and XMRV pol2 (Figure 10) primer/probe sets in single qPCR reactions. c. Detection sensitivity in human whole blood gDNA spiked with plasmid DNA and targeted with XMRV env, XMRV gag or XMRV pol2 primer/probe sets using a one-stage qPCR protocol. Human whole blood gDNA was spiked with known copy numbers of plasmid DNA containing the gene of interest. Serial log dilutions of the spiked gDNA were made and a modified version of the qPCR protocol was performed by adding a set of three pre-cycling steps (defined as a one-stage qPCR protocol) to the current qPCR protocol. The samples were targeted with XMRV env (Figure 9), XMRV gag (Figure 8) and XMRV pol2 (Figure 10) primer/probe sets in single qPCR reactions. d. Assessment of XMRV detection sensitivity from human whole blood sourced from healthy donors and spiked with plasmid DNA. Genomic DNA from whole blood from healthy donors were used to spike in known copy numbers of plasmid DNA. Serial dilutions of the gDNA were made to generate 1E3, 1E2, 1E1 and 1E0 copies per reaction. A 0-stage and a 1-stage qPCR protocol were performed. The samples were targeted with XMRV env (Figure 12), XMRV gag (Figure 11) or XMRV pol2 (Figure 13) primer/probe sets in single qPCR reactions. e. 22Rv1 Positive control recovery assessment spiked into human whole blood gDNA. 22Rv1 gDNA (positive for XMRV, E.C. Knouf et al. J.Virol 83:78353-7356 2009) was spiked into purified human whole blood gDNA (pre and post gDNA extraction) at increasing log dilutions (one human whole blood sample control and one TE sample were spiked pre-extraction with 500 ng of 22Rv1 gDNA to yield a final concentration of ~2.5 ng/µL). A 0-stage and a 1-stage qPCR protocol were performed with primers targeting the XMRV gag, XMRV env and XMRV pol sequences. Optimizations (primer concentration and temperature) for Pol primer set were carried out. Both XMRV gag and XMRV env primer sets are XMRV specific whereas the Pol primer sets detect both MLV and XMRV. A qPCR protocol used for all 4 primer sets: BioRad Supermix65.prcl Step 1:95°C 5 minStep 2:95°C 15 secStep 3:65°C 30 sec [repeat step 2-3 44X more times] Figures 6 and 7 show results obtained by the methods and compositions disclosed above. TaqqMan® Gold RT-PCR Kit and TaqMan® PCR universal master mix are obtained from PE Biosystems. RNAeasy® mini kit and QIAamp® viral RNA mini kit are obtained from Qiagen. Various cell culture materials and biological samples to be tested are obtained from vendors or subjects. MLV recombinant isolates comprise the sequences set forth in International Application No. PCT/US09/58512 and published on April 1, 2010 as publication no. WO 2010/036986. Two primer/probe sets for the detection of XMRV were designed as set forth above. One forward primer (FP), one reverse primer (RP), and one probe were used for the detection of XMRV gag and XMRV env. A third set of primer/probe was used for the detection of XMRV and MLV using the primers above that amplify the pol region of XMRV and MLV. The qPCR reaction mixture contains 900 nM primers (both forward and reverse) and 200 nM probe. Concentrations tested to be effective for detection include, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 nM and any ratio between 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 of primer concentrations. The activation of Taq polymerase is achieved at 95°C for 5 minutes is followed by forty-four cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds and annealing and elongation at 65° C for 30 seconds. Example 5: Detection of MLV in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples. Tumors from mice were removed and divided into 2 equal parts. One part of the tumor was formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and the other part of the tumor was frozen at -80°C. The FFPE mouse tumor tissue was cut in half, with one half spiked-in with a known copy number amount of pAZ3-emd and the other half was not spiked-in. A known copy number amount of pAZ3-emd was spiked-in to the frozen fresh mouse tissue and pre-processing incubation buffer. The FFPE and frozen fresh mouse tissues were incubated at 56°C overnight in a pre-processing incubation buffer containing proteinase K and dithiothreitol (DTT). The following day, the mouse tissue was processed on the Maxwell 16 instrument to extract out gDNA as per standard procedure. The extracted gDNA concentration was quantified on the Nanodrop 1000. The extracted DNA was tested for presence of MLV and env2 sequences by qPCR with the results shown in Figure 14. Example 6: XMRV/MLV RT-PCR Assay. The XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus) RT-PCR assay is performed to quantify RNA from biological samples, such as whole blood and plasma, without the need for RNA extraction. The assay employs a two-step amplification process with the initial step consisting of the distribution of 2 µL of experimental sample directly into a cDNA reaction mix. Following completion of the reverse transcriptase (RT) cDNA synthesis, a 2 µL aliquot is removed, transferred into a qPCR reaction mix and a qPCR protocol is performed. A quantitation curve is established with 7 non-zero samples comprising of serial dilutions of defined copy number of reference vector to generate a Ct value versus copy number correlation. Linear regression analysis generates an equation which is used to calculate the copy number in the sample. (Figure 15). Four control samples and one reagent control are used for this assay and are run in parallel with all test samples. The two step reaction requires controls for both the RT procedure and the qPCR procedure. Therefore, a positive, a negative and a non-template control are included for the cDNA synthesis step and a positive, negative and non-template control are included for the qPCR portion of the process. A negative matrix sample (i. e. whole blood) is spiked with a defined quantity of 22Rv1 viral vector (see description under 'Reference Standard'). This control is prepared fresh with each run to determine the efficiency of the cDNA generation in the RT step. 22Rv1 genomic DNA containing the integrated retroviral vector sequences of XMRV provides the best biophysical mimic of the actual amplification target to be screened in patient tissues. A negative matrix sample (i. e. whole blood) is used as a negative RT control as it does not contain any detectable XMRV endogenous sequences. This control is prepared fresh with each run to verify that non-specific products are not generated during cDNA synthesis of the qRT step. Confirmation is obtained upon completion of the qPCR procedure. No amplification is expected. DNA isolated from non-infected U-87 cell is used as a negative control as it does not contain any endogenous sequences detectable by the XMRV primer sets. The 22Rv1 human prostate carcinoma epithelial cell line has been shown to produce high-titer of the human retrovirus XMRV. This cell line was bought from ATCC and propagated in RPMI-1640 Medium containing 10% FBS, Sodium Pyruvate and Glutamax. The cell line was passaged four times before obtaining the supernatant containing the viral vector. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 µm filter and stored at -80°C. Reference vector 22Rv1 was used to spike PBS for generating a quantitation curve. Known copy numbers of vector were serially diluted to generate a Ct value versus copy number correlation. Linear regression analysis generates an equation which was used to calculate the copy number in the sample. Copy number was determined by a titer analysis which measures the number of copies of the viral genome integrated into the genome of target cells (transduction units, TU). The copy number was measured in TU equivalents. Several studies were conducted to determine the appropriate primer sets, the optimal concentration for the reactions and the optimal temperature for the cycling parameters. Specific primer sets were designed and tested for human derived material. The goal of these experiments was to identify primer sets that were XMRV specific and did not present background in test samples. The following primer sets were identified for targeting genes specific for XMRV: 1. XMRV gag XMRV 628F (5'-ACTACCCCTCTGAGTCTAACC-3') (SEQ ID NO:1) XMRV764R (5'-GGCCATCCTACATTGAAAGTTG-3') (SEQ ID NO:2) XMRV gag probe (5'-FAM-CGCATTGCATCCAACCAGTCTGTG-3'-BHQ) (SEQ ID NO:3)2. XMRV env XMRV 6252F (5'-TTTGATTCCTCAGTGGGCTC-3') (SEQ ID NO:4) XMRV6391R (5'-CGATACAGTCTTAGTCCCCATG-3') (SEQ ID NO:5) XMRV env probe (5'-HEX-CCCTTTTACCCGCGTCAGTGAATTCT-3'-BHQ) (SEQ ID NO:6) Two primer probe sets were designed for detection of all MLV related retroviruses and XMRV. 3. MLV Pol 1 pol-F (5'-AACAAGCGGGTGGAAGACATC-3') (SEQ ID NO:7) pol-R (5'-CAAAGGCGAAGAGAGGCTGAC-3') (SEQ ID NO:8) pol probe (5'-HEX-CCCACCGTGCCCAACCCTTACAACC-3'-TAMRA) (SEQ ID NO:9)4. MLV Pol 2 5' Pol2 Primer(CAAGGGGCTACTGGAGGAAAG) (SEQ ID NO: 10) 3' Pol2 Primer:(CTTTCCTCCATGTACCAGACTG) (SEQ ID NO: 11) Pol2 Probe:(5HEX/TATCGCTGGACCACGGATCGCAA/3BHQ_1) (SEQ ID NO:12) Two primer probe sets were designed for detection of amphotropic MLV virus. 5. MLV Env2 5'Env2 primer: 5'-ACCCTCAACCGCCCCTACAAGT-3'(SEQ ID NO: 13) 3'Env2 primer: 5'-GTTAAGCGCCTGATAGGCTC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 14) Env2 probe: 5'-/FAM/CCCCAAATGAAAGACCCCCGCTGACG/BHQ/-3'(SEQ ID NO: 15)6. MLV LTR One primer probe set was designed for detection of MLV in the LTR sequence 5'MLVLTR primer: AGC CCA CAA CCC CTC ACT C (SEQ ID NO: 16) 3' MLVLTR primer TCT CCC GAT CCC GGA CGA (SEQ ID NO: 17) MLVLTR probe: FAM-CCCCAAATGAAAGACCCCCGCTGACG 3BHQ_1 (SEQ ID NO:18)7. Cytosine deaminase gene One primer probe set was designed for detection of the Cytosine deaminase gene 5' yCD2 Primer: (ATC ATC ATG TAC GGC ATC CCT AG) (SEQ ID NO:19) 3' yCD2 Primer: (TGA ACT GCT TCA TCA GCT TCT TAC) (SEQ ID NO:20) yCD2 Probe: (5FAM/TCA TCG TCA ACA ACC ACC ACC TCG T/3BHQ_1) (SEQ ID NO:21). Example 7: Monitoring of GBM patients treated with an MLV vector. Open-label, ascending-dose trial of the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of Toca 511 administered to subjects with recurrent High Grade Glioma (including GBM) who have undergone surgery followed by adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy was carried out (see http[:]//clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01156584? term=tocagen&rank=1 ). Ascending doses of Toca 511(aka T5.0002) were prepared suitable for clinical use (WO2010148203) and delivered via stereotactic transcranial injection into the tumor. The starting dose was 2.6 x 103 TU/g. Subjects meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria received Toca 511 via stereotactic, transcranial injection into their tumor. Approximately three weeks (± 1 week) later subjects underwent a baseline gadolinium-enhanced MRI (Gd-MRI) scan and then began treatment with oral 5-FC at approximately 130 mg/kg/day for 6 days. On the 4th, 5th or 6th day of dosing the trough 5-FC serum concentration was determined and the dose of 5-FC adjusted in subsequent cycles to maintain the trough concentration in the therapeutic range. If tolerated, these 6-day courses of 5-FC were repeated approximately every 4 weeks (± 1 week) until institution of new antineoplastic treatment for tumor progression. Subjects undergo Gd-MRI scanning approximately every 8 weeks. Tumor response are assessed using the Macdonald criteria. A standard dose-escalation algorithm is being followed. Three subjects are evaluated at each of up to four dose levels of Toca 511 (2.6 x 103, 9.5 x 103, 2.5 x 104, and the Maximum Feasible Dose [MFD], not to exceed 1 x 105 TU/g). So far three patients at the lowest dose level have been treated. Two patients 101 and 102 were monitored using qPCR testing of whole blood DNA (MLVLTR Primer probe set) and RT-qPCR using the MLV env2 primer-probe set. In addition, saliva an urine were monitored by DNA qPCR, and antibodies to the vector were measured (ref MLV ELISA Application?). These data are shown in Figure 16. Other primers useful in the methods and composition of the disclosure for detecting XMRV and MLV related viruses include those in Table 1.
