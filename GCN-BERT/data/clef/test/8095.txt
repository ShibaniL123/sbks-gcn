rac-(2R,3S,4R,5R)-tert-butyl 3-cyclopropyl-4-nitro-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylate
(E)-(2-Nitrovinyl)cyclopropane (Core 45C, 0.575 g, 5.08 mmol), (E)-tert-butyl 2-(benzylideneamino)acetate (Core 1A, 0.929 g, 4.24 mmol), silver acetate (1.061 g, 6.35 mmol), and powdered activated 3A sieves in toluene (8 mL) and tetrahydrofuran (8.00 mL) were cooled to 0° C. and treated dropwise with triethylamine (1.5 mL, 10.76 mmol). The mixture stirred from 0° C. to room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was then filtered through diatomaceous earth, and the filter pad was washed with ethyl acetate. The combined filtrates were treated with 40 mL saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution, and the mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel. The mixture was extracted twice with ethyl acetate, and the combined organics were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography, eluting with 0 to 40% ethyl acetate-heptanes, to provide the title compound 0.615 g (44% yield).
