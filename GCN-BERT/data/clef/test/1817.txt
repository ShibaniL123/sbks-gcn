Intermediate 32: 8-Methyl-2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
A microwave vial was charged with 6-iodo-8-methyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (139 mg, 0.43 mmol), methyl 2,2-difluoro-2-(fluorosulfonyl)acetate (0.14 mL, 1.1 mmol), CuI (202 mg, 1.1 mmol), DMPU (0.3 mL, 2.4 mmol), and DMF (2.7 mL). The vial was evacuated under vacuum and backfilled with Na (×3), and then capped and sealed. The reaction was then stirred in a microwave reactor at 130° C. for 30 min. The mixture was cooled to rt and filtered over a pad of Celite®, eluting with MeOH. After concentrating the filtrate in vacuo, the residue was dissolved in a mixture of EtOAc and H2O. The organic layer was washed with sat. aq. NH4Cl, and then the combined aqueous layers extracted with EtOAc (×2). The combined organics were washed with brine (×3), dried over Na2SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a pale yellow oil (79 mg, 69%).
