ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This invention was made with government support under Grants NIH EY06062, EY10291, and HL84388, awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND The development of novel approaches that allow or enhance cellular uptake of a variety of physiologically and therapeutically active agents relies on the elucidation of new molecular tranporter/translocator molecules and methodologies. [Fukati, S. Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 2005, 57, 547; Langel, Ü. Cell-Penetrating Peptides; CRC Press: Boca Raton, Fla., 2002.] In the past several years, strategies to overcome the limiting uptake of the plasma membrane have included peptide vectors, such as Tat peptide and other various arginine rich oligopeptides. [Wender, P. A.; Mitchell, D. J.; Pattabiraman, K.; Pelkey, E. T.; Steinman, L.; Rothbard, J. B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000, 97, 13003; Zhao, M.; Weissleder, R. Med. Res. Rev. 2004, 24, 1.] Arginine-rich HIV-Tat peptide (R49KKRRQRRR57) and its derivatives have been given much attention; primarily because of their high efficiency, short sequence, and capabilities of transporting various types of molecular structures, such as small molecular weight compounds, oligonucleotides, magnetic beads, plasmid DNA, and even a full 129 kDa protein across the membranes of most cell types. [Wender, P. A.; Mitchell, D. J.; Pattabiraman, K.; Pelkey, E. T.; Steinman, L.; Rothbard, J. B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000, 97, 13003; Zhao, M.; Weissleder, R. Med. Res. Rev. 2004, 24, 1.] Studies of short oligomers composed of six to fifteen contiguous arginine residues as well as nonlinear branched peptides containing eight arginine units were shown to cross cell membranes efficiently and outperformed Tat in uptake assays. [Wender, P. A.; Kreider, E.; Pelkey, E. T.; Steinman, L.; Rothbard, J. B.; VanDeusen, C. L. Org. Lett. 2005, 7, 4815.] Although the exact translocation mechanism remains to be understood, it is known that the high arginine content plays an important role for translocation. [Fukati, S. Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 2005, 57, 547.] However, these peptide or peptoid-based molecular transporters are limited by high cost, scalability, solubility, and stability. Therefore, there is significant need for the development of new cell permeable transporter molecules with membrane translocating activity. Efficient intracellular delivery can avoid non-specific effects, reduce toxicity, and allow a reduction in dosage levels. In particular, sufficiently efficient technologies can deliver drugs to the cytoplasm or the nucleus to better target more efficient novel technologies through accumulation of the therapeutic in subcellular locations.

For purposes of this disclosure, the heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, can have hydrogen substituents and/or any permissible substituents of organic compounds described herein which satisfy the valences of the heteroatoms. This disclosure is not intended to be limited in any manner by the permissible substituents of organic compounds. Also, the terms “substitution” or “substituted with” include the implicit proviso that such substitution is in accordance with permitted valence of the substituted atom and the substituent, and that the substitution results in a stable compound, e.g., a compound that does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, etc. “A1,” “A2,” “A3,” and “A4” are used herein as generic symbols to represent various specific substituents.

B. DENDRIMERIC COMPOUNDS Dendrimers can be ideal building blocks for biomedical applications, because of their precise architecture, high loading capacity, tunable solubility, immunogenicity, and bioconjugation capability. [Gillies, E. R.; Fréchet, J. M. J. Drug Discov. Today 2005, 10, 35; Lee, C. C.; MacKay, J. A.; Fréchet, J. M. J.; Szoka, F. C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005, 23, 1517.] The combination of the unique properties of dendrimers with membrane-permeable guanidino groups can lead to a more efficient-synthesis of membrane-permeable carrier molecules possessing high efficiency, for example, for bulk production. The compounds of the invention are desirably based upon a compact, high branching multiplicity dendrimer, for example, the classic Newkome-type dendrimer. [Newkome, G. R.; Behera, R. K.; Moorefield, C. N.; Baker, G. R. J. Org. Chem. 1991, 56, 7162.] Newkome type dendrimers are typically 1→3 C-branched polyamide macromolecules, built from “Behera's Amine” monomer or its derivatives, and can be attached to a variety of starting cores, surfaces, and polymers. It is also understood that the compounds of the invention can be tailored to enhance accumulation in specific sublocations of cells, such as the nucleus, the cytosol, or the mitochondria. Tailoring can be the selection of chemical moieties or groups having an affinity for a targeted subcellular region of a cell, for example an organelle, and the functionalization of the compounds with the selected chemical moieties or groups. Such tailoring of the compound structure can be accomplished using organic synthetic methodology know to those of skill in the art. In one aspect, the invention relates to compounds comprising the structure: and at least one guanidinium residue, wherein m is zero or a positive integer. In certain aspects, m can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 and each residue can be substituted or unsubstituted. In a further aspect, m is 1. In one aspect, the invention relates to compounds comprising the structure: wherein n and o are, independently, zero or a positive integer; wherein R1 and R2 are, independently, hydrogen, oxygen, alkyl, acyl, thioacyl, or carbonyl; wherein R3 is hydrogen, alkyloxycarbonyl, or alkyl; R4 is hydrogen, or alkyloxycarbonyl; wherein R5 and R6 are, independently, hydrogen, or alkyl; and wherein R7 is hydrogen or alkyloxycarbonyl.

C. METHODS OF MAKING DENDRIMERIC COMPOUNDS The disclosed methods typically employ a divergent method to prepare a G-1 dendrimer scaffold with nine end functionalities. Although the Newkome type dendrimer is well known, one of the drawbacks for a broader application of conventional methods is the elaborate synthesis of the monomer. In contrast, the “Behera's amine” gives the most compact, low molecular weight polyamide dendrimer possible; achieving the necessary nine end functionalities in just one generation of dendritic growth. As set forth below and in the Experimental section, following synthesis of the monomer through improved hydrogenation and work-up procedures, the G-1 dendritic nona-acid scaffold can be prepared in high yields (see FIGS. 6A and 6B). In order to introduce the guanidinium groups to the dendrimer exterior as shown in FIG. 1, the nine carboxylic acid groups were first converted into nine protected amine groups, by reaction with, for example, N-Boc ethylendiamine and N-Boc-1,6-diaminehexane through amide coupling reactions. After removal of the protecting groups, the nine free amines can be reacted with a guandinylating reagent [Feiehtinger, K.; Sings, H. L.; Baker, T. J.; Matthews, K.; Goodman, M. J. Org. Chem. 1998, 63, 8432.] to give a guanidinylated dendritic scaffold in high yield. For uptake evaluation and imaging function, a fluorophore can be conjugated to the focal point of the molecular transporter. The attachment of a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) moiety to the guanidinylated scaffold can be achieved with a reduction of the nitro group at the focal point to an amino group via hydrogenation at room temperature in quantitative yields, followed by direct reaction with FITC to form the Boc-protected FITC-labeled guanidino-dendrimer. After deprotection of the Boc-protected guanidine groups, FITC-labeled dendritic molecules can be obtained and further purified by dialysis or HPLC. In one aspect, the invention relates to methods of preparing compounds having the structure: wherein n is an integer from 1 to 9, wherein R3 is hydrogen or alkyl, wherein R4 and R7 are, independently, hydrogen, alkyloxycarbonyl, alkyl, or acyl; wherein R7 is hydrogen, alkyl, or acyl; wherein Y comprises a nitro group, an amine group, an amide group, azide group, or an alkyloxycarbonyl protected amine group or a derivative thereof, the method comprising the steps of providing a first compound comprising the structure: wherein X comprises OH, halogen, or OC(O)-alkyl; coupling the first compound with at least about three molar equivalents of a second compound comprising the structure: wherein G1 is an ester-protecting group; removing the ester-protecting group; reacting the product of step (c) with at least about three molar equivalents of a third compound comprising the structure: wherein G2 is an amine-protecting group; removing the amine-protecting group; and functionalizing the product of step (e) with at least three molar equivalents of a guanidine-providing agent.

In a further aspect, the payload moiety is a pharmaceutically-active group. For example, the pharmaceutically-active group is selected from a small molecular weight drug, a silica nanoparticle, a metal nanoparticle, a protein, a peptide, a linear polymer backbone, a hydrogel, a collapsed nanoparticle, a dendrimers, or a hyperbranched polymeric structure. For example, in various aspects, the pharmaceutically-active group can comprise one or more of superparamagnetic iron oxide particles, doxorubicin, methotrexate, liposome, multiple sclerosis agents, cis-platinum, paclitaxel, hormones, antioxidants, antimicrobials, antibacterial agents, antidepressants, sedatives, antihypertensive drugs, antibodies, a carbohydrate-based drug, cardioprotective εPKC agonist peptide, Fab fragments of the anti-melanoma antibody NRML-05, pan-carcinoma antibody NRLU-10, anti-CEA immunotoxin, liposome drugs, fusogenic, dendritic cell vaccines, VHL tumor suppressor peptide, HER-2, Pro-apotoxic Smac peptide, viralcapsids, and/or bacteria. B. Intracellular Delivery In one aspect, the invention relates to methods of intracellular delivery comprising administering an effective amount of one or more compounds of the invention or one or more compositions of the invention to a subject. The subject is a mammal, for example, a human. In a further aspect, the subject is a cell. The delivery can be, for example, oral, transmucosal, rectal, or subcutaneous administration or, for example, intravenous, intrathecal, intramuscular, intranasal, intraperitonel, or intraocular injection. 2. Pharmaceutical Compositions A pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of the invention or one or more compositions of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for administration in a mammal, for example, a human. The compositions can be, for example, granules, powders, tablets, or capsules. A. Dosage A “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic result or to have an effect on undesired symptoms, but is generally insufficient to cause adverse side affects. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration; the route of administration; the rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of a compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently, single dose compositions can contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any contraindications. Dosage can vary, and can be administered in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several days. Guidance can be found in the literature for appropriate dosages for given classes of pharmaceutical products. B. Carriers A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like), carboxymethylcellulose and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents such as paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It can also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin, which delay absorption. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide, poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. The injectable formulations may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable media just prior to use. Suitable inert carriers can include sugars such as lactose. Desirably, at least 95% by weight of the particles of the active ingredient have an effective particle size in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrometers. E. SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF “BOW-TIE” DENDRITIC MOLECULAR TRANSPORTERS BY ORTHOGONAL AND CLICK APPROACH Disclosed is the synthesis and characterization of “Bow-Tie” dendritic architectures with orthogonally reactive groups, defined composition and functionality, which can be used as multi-drug carries for specific intracellular delivery. Huisgen cycloadditions or so called “click” reactions have been shown to be extremely versatile tools for advanced macromolecular design. However, little attempt has been made to utilize this approach to prepare multifunctional dendritic structures. In the disclosed approach, two orthogonal protected dendritic structures are combined by utilizing the “click” reaction. This strategy allows the controlled deprotection of the trifluoro protecting group to selectively attach the dithiopyridylpropionic acid the periphery of the macromolecule. In a further step, the BOC groups of the second dendritic scaffolds are deprotected to be guanydilated to the ethyl- or hexyl linker of the system. The bow-tie structure is the first of its kind that consists of a molecular transporter part and drug delivery entity on the other. The chemistry applied for the construction is high-yielding and, thus, gives the bow-tie delivery structure in the most straightforward approach. In this fashion, nine drug molecules, for example peptides, genes and oligonucleotides can be transported across cellular membranes. Synthetic Pathway of Acid-labile Azide-linker-Dendron: Synthetic Pathway for Base-labile Alkyne-linker-Dendron: Bifunctional Bow-Tie Synthesis by Click Reaction: Further Functionalization for Synthesis of Cell-Permeable Multi-Drug Carrier Conjugates: In one aspect, the invention relates to compounds comprising the structure: wherein each m is independently zero or a positive integer, and wherein L is a linking moiety comprising optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkoxyl, optionally substituted heteroalkyl, or optionally substituted heteroaryl. In a further aspect, L comprises a structure: wherein each n is independently selected from 0-8. That is, L can comprise the reaction product of a “click” reaction. In a further aspect, the compound can comprise a structure wherein n is an integer from 1 to 9; wherein R3 is hydrogen or alkyl; wherein R4 is hydrogen, or alkyloxycarbonyl, alkyl, or acyl; and wherein R7 is hydrogen or alkyloxycarbonyl. In a yet further aspect, the compound can comprise the structure: wherein n is an integer from 1 to 9; wherein R3 is hydrogen or alkyl; wherein R4 is hydrogen, or alkyloxycarbonyl, alkyl, or acyl; and wherein R7 is hydrogen or alkyloxycarbonyl. In a still further aspect, the compound can comprise the structure: wherein n is an integer from 1 to 9; wherein R3 is hydrogen or alkyl; wherein R4 is hydrogen, or alkyloxycarbonyl, alkyl, or acyl; and wherein R7 is hydrogen or alkyloxycarbonyl. In an even further aspect, the compound can comprise the structure: wherein each n is independently an integer from 0 to 9; wherein R3 is hydrogen or alkyl; wherein R4 is hydrogen, or alkyloxycarbonyl, alkyl, or acyl; and wherein R7 is hydrogen or alkyloxycarbonyl. It is demonstrated that the disclosed transporter (e.g., FD-2, hexyl linker) shows selectivity towards the mitochondria of a cell. (see FIG. 33) The FD-1 shows selectivity towards the cell nucleus (see FIG. 32). A common obstacle in macromolecular drug delivery is the cellular uptake into cell compartments that do not release the drug delivery vector into the cytosol or mitochondria in which the drug becomes effective. Most other delivery pathways into the cell end up in the lysosome and do not get released (endocytosis). The therapeutic efficacy of drug molecules typically depends on its ability to reach desired target tissues, cells and intracellular organelles. The mitochondria play a key role in apoptosis (cancer therapy), familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease), Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), lactic acidosis, strokelike syndrome (MELAS) Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS), myoclonic epilepsy, ragged-red fibers (MERRF), cluster of metabolic diseases (SyndromeX), progressive external ophthalmophlegia (PEO) and antioxidants. By targeting the mitochondria, the disclosed compounds, compositions, and methods can play a role in therapy or prevention of disease processes relating to mitochondria function. When the disclosed transporter is attached to the disclosed nanoparticle, it can enter the cell and also can achieve localization in the entire cell, including the mitochondria. The nanoparticle allows delivering a high drug load and, thus, can facilitate delivery of small and other molecules, such as peptides, nucleotides and such. The structures can be further modified with amines to allow complexation with plasmic DNA and covalent attachment s though covalent approaches. (see FIGS. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29). A nanoparticle with a number of molecular transporter moieties conjugated to the periphery crosses the plasmic membrane and localizes in the cytosol and, particularly, in the mitochondria of the cells. Techniques are disclosed that allow the attachment of the molecular transporter the scaffolds that increase the drug load significantly. Attachment to the “bow-tie” structure and/or the attachment to nanoparticles from intramolecular chain collapse techniques also increase the drug load significantly. The dendritic transporter allows the conjugation of nine bioactive conjugates and the drug load is increased nine fold by attaching a dendric molecule to the focal point of the dendritic molecular transporter (bow-tie). A well-defined macromolecule is designed, that is “clicked” together in a Huisgen type reaction. The deprotection of the basic/acidic protecting groups allows the modification to a delivery system with a short ethyl linker or hexyl linker before guanidylation to maintain uptake into specific subcellular locations. The disulfide linker is only one of the examples of a linker chemistry attached to the drug part of the bow-tie structure. All other linkers presented can be applied as well. The drug load can be increased nine-fold by attaching a dendric molecule to the focal point of the dendritic molecular transporter (bow-tie). A well-defined macromolecule is designed, that is “clicked” together in a Huisgen type reaction. The deprotection of the basic/acidic protecting groups allows the modification to a delivery system with a short ethyl linker or hexyl linker before guanidylation to maintain uptake into specific subcellular locations. Here, the drug load can be increased to a theoretical amount of 100-300 positions to conjugate small molecule drugs, peptides, oligonucleotides and more. The functionalization of the particle with a varied amount of amines allows together with the attachment of transporter allows the development of a gene delivery system. A “drug” can also be conjugated though a disulfide bond in a covalent conjugation approach. For example, proteins can be delivered. (see FIGS. 37, 38, 40, and 41). F. ORGANIC QUANTUM DOTS VIA INTRAMOLECULAR CHAIN COLLAPSE The synthesis and application of polymeric nanoparticles has attracted significant attention due to, in part, the realization that functionalized nanoparticles can be considered as building blocks for a variety of nanotechnological applications, ranging from vectors for drug and DNA delivery systems to templating agents for nanoporous microelectronic materials. Typical strategies for preparing nanoparticles can be broadly classified into two main approaches, top-down approaches—where emulsion polymerization techniques result in particles from 20 to 50 nm—and bottom-up approaches—which either rely on the synthesis of discrete spherical macromolecules such as dendrimers (1-10 nm) or the self-assembly of linear block copolymers into polymeric micelles followed by chemical cross-linking to give nanoparticles with typical dimensions ranging from 20 to 200 nm. As a consequence, the ability to routinely prepare nanoparticles in the 5-20 nm size range is limited. To address this issue, strategies involving the collapse and intramolecular coupling of single-polymer chains to give discrete nanoparticles have been developed. However, typical intramolecular chain collapse strategies can fail to provide resultant nanoparticles with satisfactory functionality. Moreover, these strategies can also fail to provide reactive monomers capable of undergoing the requisite intramolecular chain collapse at desirable temperatures and/or under desirable conditions. In contrast, the disclosed methods and compounds address these shortcomings. 1. Copolymers for Intramolecular Chain Collapse “Organic quantum dots” can be formed from AB-block, ABA-block, and graft-type copolymers via intramolecular chain collapse (see FIG. 7 and FIG. 8). Such organic quantum dots can comprise a functional moiety, e.g. a color-tunable semiconducting block (see FIG. 9, FIG. 10, and FIG. 11). Methods and compositions for preparing copolymers capable of undergoing intramolecular chain collapse are known and described in, for example, Harth et al., “A Facile Approach to Architecturally Defined Nanoparticles via Intramolecular Chain Collapse,” J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2002, 124, 8653-8660, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The field of living free radical polymerizations, where the high degree of control is a result of equilibrium between dormant and reactive propagating radicals, can be useful for developing strategies for nanoparticle formation. In such polymerizations, the reactive radical chain ends are present in extremely low concentrations. This general concept, that is, only the reactive species need to be at ultra-dilute concentrations, can be applied to the formation of nanoparticles by intramolecular coupling. In this case, the linear polymer, which contains numerous latent coupling groups along the backbone, can be added slowly to a heated solvent in which the coupling groups are either thermally or chemically activated. As a consequence, the traditional conditions of ultrahigh dilution typically need only be met for the reactive intermediates and not for the polymers themselves. Following this coupling event, the nanoparticles are typically unreactive to further coupling reaction, which allows their concentration to increase to relatively high levels, (0.1-1.0 M) without intermolecular cross-linking reactions leading to gelation or coupling of individual nanoparticles. The ability to work at 0.1-1.0 M concentrations can be compared to the typically impractical concentration levels (ca. 10−6 M) required for traditional ultrahigh dilution techniques. The nature of the cross-linking group can be important; it can be selectively activated and react rapidly, leading to efficient intramolecular bond formation. It can also be important that this reaction is irreversible and leads to a coupled structure that is subsequently unreactive under the reaction conditions. To fulfill these goals, attention was directed to the benzocyclobutene group (BCB), which has found wide use as a latent Diels-Alder reagent in organic synthesis and in the formulation of thermosetting materials. Upon heating, the benzocyclobutene group, Q1, undergoes ring opening to give a relatively reactive o-quinoid structure, Q2, which primarily reacts via an irreversible dimerization reaction to form the dibenzocyclooctadiene derivative, Q3, as well as a mixture of unidentified oligomeric materials (FIG. 12). The direct result of this chemistry is the selective formation of cross-links from the coupling of two or more benzocyclobutene units. Having identified the benzocyclobutene functionality as the critical coupling group for the preparation of nanoparticles, the desired monomer, 4-vinylbenzocyclobutene, Q4, was prepared from 4-bromobenzocyclobutene, Q5, by initial Grignard formation followed by reaction with N,N-dimethylformamide to give the aldehyde, Q6. Wittig coupling of Q6 with methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide afforded the desired styrene derivative, Q4, in high yield (FIG. 13). The incorporation of the cyclobutene group into the monomer, Q4, did not decrease its stability when compared to styrene, and Q4 proved to be stable to a wide variety of reaction conditions. One key to the success of this intramolecular chain collapse strategy is the minimization or elimination of intermolecular cross-linking between BCB groups on different chains. Since the balance between intramolecular coupling and intermolecular cross-linking can be influenced by the number and placement of BCB units along the polymeric backbone, accurate control of the starting linear polymers structure also can be important. To achieve this and to permit a wide variety of linear polymers to be conveniently prepared, the polymerization of the desired monomer, 4-vinylbenzocyclobutene, Q4, was examined under living free radical conditions. Copolymerization of Q4 with vinyl monomers such as styrene, methyl methacrylate, or n-butyl acrylate in the presence of the R-hydrido alkoxyamine, Q7, proved to be a controlled procedure, leading to random incorporation of the reactive BCB units and low polydispersities for the resulting copolymers, Q8 (FIG. 14). At molecular weights less than 120000 amu the polydispersities for these random copolymers were 1.08-1.16, which increased to 1.19-1.26 for molecular weights above 200000 amu. This increased polydispersity is due, at least on part, to the significantly reduced concentration of initiating groups at these high molecular weights and has been observed previously for both ATRP- and nitroxide-mediated procedures. The BCB-functionalized polystyrene derivatives, Q8, can be readily characterized by standard techniques and incorporation of the BCB units monitored by 1H NMR which showed characteristic aliphatic resonances for the cyclobutene ring at 3.10 ppm. Intramolecular collapse was then examined under traditional ultrahigh dilution techniques. For this, a solution of a 80:20 styrene/BCB random copolymer, Q8 (Mw=95000; PDI=1.11) in dibenzyl ether was heated at a variety of concentrations under N2 for 30 min at 250° C. As can be seen in FIG. 15, at very low concentrations of BCB groups, ca. 5.0×10−5 M (see inset, FIG. 15), intermolecular cross-linking becomes apparent as evidenced by the increase in molecular weight of the product from its base value of 65000 for a discrete nanoparticle due to chain-chain coupling. This ability to readily identify chain-chain coupling has been previously observed for dendrimer chemistry where even minor amounts of intermolecular coupling can be easily detected by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). This ability is due to the molecular weight doubling on chain-chain coupling, and the combination of this feature with the low polydispersity of the initial chains results in a lower limit of ca. 1-2% of intermolecular cross-linking being readily detected as a higher molecular shoulder under standard GPC conditions. At higher concentrations of ca. 9.0×10−3 M crosslinking to a swollen gel occurs very rapidly due to the large number of BCB functional groups along the polymeric backbone. While these concentrations are comparable to results obtained with other traditional ultra-high dilution techniques, the results are in stark contrast to the continuous addition strategy. In this approach, a concentrated solution ([BCB]=0.2 M) of the same starting linear polymer, Q8, is continuously added via a peristaltic pump to a high-boiling solvent, such as dibenzyl ether, heated at 250° C. to give a final BCB concentration of 0.05 M. After addition, the solvent is removed, and the nanoparticles, Q9, are isolated using normal precipitation techniques (FIG. 16). No gelation or intermolecular crosslinking is observed under these conditions, and only after increasing the final concentration of BCB groups to 0.12 M were minor amounts of nanoparticle coupling observed. The ability to successfully conduct these chain-collapse reactions at final BCB concentrations of 0.01-0.1 M represents an increase of 3-4 orders of magnitude when compared to the traditional ultrahigh dilution strategy (FIG. 15). This permits multigram samples to be prepared on a routine basis with standard laboratory equipment, a dramatic improvement compared to previous approaches. One significant feature of the above concentration studies is the reduction in hydrodynamic volume of the random coil linear polymer on intramolecular collapse to give the final nanoparticle. In the above example, the original linear polymer has a molecular weight, Mw of 95000 amu; however, upon reaction the macromolecule decreases in size to give a nanoparticle with an apparent or polystyrene equivalent Mw of 65000 amu. Dynamic light scattering was also employed to follow this decrease in size, and a reduction in the hydrodynamic radius, Rh from 8.7 to 6.6 nm, was observed upon intramolecular collapse. Since essentially no byproducts are produced during this reaction and no molecular weight lost, this decrease can only be due to a change in the architecture of the macromolecule from a random coil to a nanoparticle. Again, this is consistent with dendrimer chemistry where the compact, three-dimensional dendritic structure leads to an apparent molecular weight which is significantly smaller than the actual molecular weight. Further confirmation of the structural change was obtained from NMR studies; of particular note is the observed absence of unreacted BCB units in the final nanoparticles, Q9. As shown in FIG. 17, comparison of the 1H NMR spectra for the starting linear polymer, Q8, and the nanoparticle, Q9, shows the prominent resonance for the aliphatic protons of the cyclobutene group at 3.10 ppm in the former, which completely disappear after collapse, and a broad resonance at 2.0-3.0 ppm is observed. This is consistent with ring opening of the benzocyclobutene group and coupling to give cyclooctane derivatives and higher aliphatic coupled oligomers. A direct consequence of this ring opening is that the BCB groups undergo reaction to give dimers and oligomers that do not undergo any further coupling chemistry. This fulfils one of the requirements discussed above for a successful intramolecular chain collapse reaction and permits the substantial build-up of product in the final reaction mixture. The lack of reactivity can also be demonstrated by repeated thermal cycling of the isolated nanoparticles, which results in no observable change in physical properties such as molecular weight, NMR spectra, and so forth. Formation of the nanoparticles also leads to an increase in the glass transition temperature of the nanoparticles when compared to the starting linear polymers. The BCB functionalized linear polystyrenes, Q8, show Tg's similar to that observed for polystyrene, ca. 100-105° C., while the glass transition temperature for the nanoparticles, Q9, increase by ca. 20° C. to 120-130° C. at 20% BCB incorporation with an associated broadening of the transition. All of the above data is consistent with the intramolecular collapse of a random coil linear polymer to give a single, higher density nanoparticle. One unique feature of being able to tailor the nanoparticle via the starting linear polymer was then examined in detail using three different series of polystyrene derivatives, ca. 44000; 110000; and 230000 amu containing varying levels of BCB incorporation from 1.25 to 30% (Table 1). Under the continuous addition technique described above, conversion of the linear polymers to nanoparticles was a facile process at all molecular weights and percent BCB incorporations studied. At concentrations of up to 0.01-0.1 M, no indication of intermolecular crosslinking was observed, and in each case the GPC trace shifted to lower hydrodynamic volumes. As can be seen in FIG. 18, for the same molecular weight of the starting linear polymer, Q8, a systematic decrease in the hydrodynamic volume of the nanoparticles is observed on increasing the percent of benzocyclobutene groups, which is consistent with an increase in the level of intramolecular coupling and a more globular, three-dimensional structure. A further pertinent feature of FIG. 18 (b-e) is the symmetrical nature/low PDI of the GPC traces for the nanoparticles and the associated lack of higher-molecular weight shoulders. This demonstrates that even at high BCB loadings, ca. 25 mol %, no detectable amount of intermolecular cross-linking is occurring.

In each case, the actual molecular weight of the cross-linked macromolecules is significantly greater than the apparent molecular weight. For example, a 70/30 styrene/BCB random copolymer with an initial molecular weight, Mw=234000 (PDI=1.23) gives a nanoparticle with a polystyrene equivalent molecular weight, Mw=63500 (PDI=1.16) which represents a reduction in hydrodynamic volume of 73%. The actual molecular weight of the final nanoparticle was also determined by light scattering and found to be 230000, which is within experimental error of that of the starting linear polymer which demonstrates that the actual molecular weights of the starting linear polymer and the final nanoparticles are approximately the same. This collapse and associated change in hydrodynamic volume is therefore due to the formation of up to 310 intramolecular links per nanoparticle, assuming that each activated BCB group reacts with one other activated BCB group. Interestingly, all plots are of a similar shape and seem to reach a plateau of between 65 and 75% reduction in apparent molecular weight (FIG. 19). It should also be noted that in the control experiments, heating polystyrene with 0% BCB incorporation resulted in no detectable change in the chromatographic or spectral properties of the polymers. Examination of the data in Table 1 also demonstrates the inherent versatility of this approach in controlling the size of the final nanoparticle. Not only can the size and cross-link density of the nanoparticle be controlled by the level of BCB incorporation, but the molecular weight of the starting linear polymer also plays a key role in determining the hydrodynamic volume of the final nanoparticle. For example, a polystyrene derivative with a 10% incorporation of BCB and a molecular weight, Mw, of 112000 gives a nanoparticle with a Rh of 6.2 nm. Increasing the molecular weight, Mw, of the starting linear polymer to 233000 while still retaining the 10% incorporation of BCB gives a larger nanoparticle with a Rh of 9.5 nm. In turn, a polystyrene derivative with an analogously higher molecular weight of 229000 but with a 25% incorporation of BCB gives a nanoparticle with a Rh of 6.4 nm, very similar to the first example with a lower molecular weight (117000) and level of BCB incorporation (10%). A consequence of this is that the size and physical characteristics of the final nanoparticle can be directly dictated by the structure and functionality of the starting linear polymer. The versatile nature of this intramolecular chain collapse approach to nanoparticles coupled with the ability to prepare a wide variety of linear polymers by living free radical techniques also opens up the possibility of preparing well-defined nanoparticles incorporating functional groups, nonstryrenic monomers, or different macromolecular architectures. As shown in Table 2, starting linear polymers based on methyl methacrylate (MMA) or n-butyl acrylate (n-BuA) can be employed as the backbone polymer with no change in the efficiency of the intramolecular collapse process. For example, copolymerization of an 85:15 mixture of n-butyl acrylate and the vinyl BCB derivative, Q4, in the presence of the alkoxyaminc initiator, 7, proceeds smoothly to give the well-defined random copolymer, Q10, with a molecular weight, Mw of 75000 and a polydispersity of 1.09. Addition of a concentrated solution of Q10 (0.1 M) to dibenzyl ether, heated at 250° C. gives a poly(n-butyl acrylate) nanoparticle, Q11, with an apparent molecular weight, Mw of 33500 and a polydispersity of 1.09. (FIG. 20). The relative selectivity of the thermal procedure used to activate the BCB group also allows other functional groups such as chloromethyl substituents to be introduced into the linear polymer, thereby leading to functionalized nanoparticles.

It should, however, be also noted that this intramolecular collapse procedure is not limited to simple linear random copolymers. Additional structural features can be built into the starting materials, which are then translated into the nanoparticle structure. For example, block copolymers can potentially be used in such an approach, and if the reactive BCB groups are contained in only one of the blocks, novel macromolecular architectures can be prepared in which a controlled number of linear chains, one or two for AB and ABA block copolymers respectively, are attached to the nanoparticle. To test this hypothesis, functionalized poly(styrene)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) AB block copolymers were prepared by living free radical procedures. The alkoxyaminc substituted poly(ethylene glycol) macroinitiator, Q12, was obtained by reaction of the sodium salt of monomethylpoly(ethylene glycol), Q13 (Mn=5000, PDI=1.06), with the chloromethyl substituted alkoxyamine, Q14. The macroinitiator, Q12, was then used to initiate the polymerization of a mixture of styrene and Q4 at 120° C. to give the desired AB block copolymer, Q15, which contains the cross-linking BCB units in the second block only (FIG. 21). Reaction of Q15 under continuous addition conditions then results in the selective intramolecular collapse of the second block to give a novel hybrid linear-nanoparticle architecture, Q16, in which a single water soluble PEG linear chain is attached to a three-dimensional cross-linked polystyrene nanoparticle, similar in structure to that of hybrid dendritic-linear block copolymers. As can be seen in FIG. 22, the effect of intramolecular collapse is clearly evident in the shift of the GPC trace for the starting poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(styrene-co-benzocyclobutene), Q15, (Mw=95000, PDI=1.11) to that of the final hybrid nanoparticle-linear block copolymer, Q16, (Mw=52000, PDI=1.09) and demonstrates the controlled nature of this procedure. The solubility of these hybrid block copolymers were similar to that for the parent polystyrene nanoparticles, which can be due to the relatively small size of the PEG block. 2. Approaches in the Development of 3-D Nanoscopic, Multimodal Vectors Nanoscopic particle design strategies (see, e.g., Huang, H.; Remsen, E. E.; Kowalewski, T.; Wooley, K. L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 3805.) to develop multimodal architectures are still limited, and the understanding of key problems in biology and medicine will be one of the driving forces to implement materials to execute biological functions. See Lui, M.; Fréchet, J. M. J. Pharm. Sci. Technol. Today. 1999, 2, 393. The same care used for these designs can be applied to polymeric nanostructures with applications in imaging and device technologies. First, highly versatile, biocompatible, building blocks from vinyl polymers with pendant amino acids as linear precursors were prepared. The approach mimics and facilitates pathways mediated in nature and allows the construction and investigation of collapsed supramolecular objects as well as nanoparticles with distinct and permanent shapes. These multifunctional nanoparticles are poised to become powerful tools for the targeted drug delivery with ScFv antibodies directed towards radiation-inducted antigens within the microvasculature. See Hallahan, D.; Geng, L.; Qu, S.; Scafone, C.; Giorgio, T.; Donnely, E.; Gao, X.; Claton, J. Cancer Cell. 2003, 3, 63. Lu, S. X.; Cebe, P.; Capel, M. Macromolecules 1997, 30(20), 6243. Multiple functionalities within the polymer backbone allow the attachment of anticancer drugs and the complexation of imaging reagents which engage the catechol units, including MRI reagents and radioactive compounds. As mentioned above, one result of this work is the development of synthetic platforms which hold the potential to be multifaceted in their application. The chemistries, which were applied, provide the opportunities to make pioneering steps towards “organic quantum dots” in the nanoscopic range of 5-15 nm and 60-100 nm. It is also contemplated that the incorporation of lanthanides can make these particles attractive objects to study in terms of their magnetic and fluorescent properties. The synthesis of the multifunctional, biocompatible 3-D nanoparticles began with the preparation of random copolymers with pendant aminoacids. See Hatanaka, K. Y.; Miyahara, S.; Sato, T.; Ono, F.; Uryu, T.; Kuzuhara, H. J. Med. Chem., 1987, 30, 810. Living free radical techniques were applied, such as nitroxide-medicated polymerization (NMP; see Smolders, W.; Monteiro, M. J. Macromolecules, 2004, 12, 34. Hawker, C. J.; Bosman, A.; Harth, E. Chem. Rev. 2001, 101, 12.) as well as Reversible Addition Chain Transfer Fragmentation (RAFT). N-Acryl amino acids gave polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions with polydispersities in the range of 1.15-1.28. The most successful RAFT polymerizations were observed in the presence of 2-cyanopentanoic acid dithiobenzoate as a dithioester chain transfer reagent. See Croce, T., Funk, M.; Adkins, C.; Harth, E. Poly. Prep, ACS Fall 2005. In experiments with NMP techniques, similar control was observed, but the polymerization appeared to be more sensitive towards the selected monomer conformation. The formation of the 3-D structures can be realized with the new vinyl benzosulfone crosslinking units, which result in non-reversible C—C bonds and are powerful alternatives to the well-known benzocyclobutene precursor. See Harth, E.; van Horn, B.; Lee, V. Y.; Germack, D. S.; Gonzales, C. P.; Miller, R. D.; Hawker, C. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 123, 8653. The nanoparticles in the range of 10-14 nm can be functionalized with spacer units to provide the optimum specific binding to expressed neo-antigens and show functionalities for the attachment of fluorophores for the first round of studies. The novel crosslinker was incorporated as well into vinyl polymer backbones growing from a fluorine-based (see McGehee, M.; Heeger, A. Adv. Materials, 200, 1655.) macroinitiator via NMP polymerization. The polystyrene blocks contained 10% crosslinking units and the resulting polymer could be prepared in the targeted MW of 20K (2:1:2). 3. O-Chinodimethane Crosslinking Precursors Benzosulfone derivatives can serve as precursors for o-chinodimethane intermediates to form nanoparticles via an intra-molecular chain collapse process. In a five-step synthesis the sulfone functionality was introduced over the oxidation of sulfides formed by a nucleophilic substitution reaction of 3,4-dimethyl benzobromine. A Heck Reaction can serve as an excellent method to transform the arylbromine derivative into the final vinylbenzosulfone in one step. The compatibility of the novel crosslinker towards living free radical polymer procedures can be confirmed, and the formation of monodisperse nanoparticles demonstrated the feasibility of the new crosslinker. The number and diversity of techniques to create well defined polymeric architectures has led the foundation to built more refined structures with multifaceted, cross disciplinary applications. The fascination to prepare 3-D nanostructures stems from the desire to benefit from the shape and thereby the function in a biological environment or artificial system. In order to control a range of different size dimensions in the nanoscale a number of techniques have been recently successfully investigated and applied. Recently, the synthesis of nanoparticles in the size dimension of 5-10 nm was reported implementing an intramolecular chain collapse process of one linear polymer. The folded linear polymer is locked into the 3-D architecture by covalent crosslinking units incorporated into the polymer. The copolymerized crosslinking units are thermally activated and form a highly reactive o-chinodimethane unit from benzocyclobutene derivatives. However, the copolymerized crosslinking monomer, vinyl benzocyclobutene is not easily accessible and requires a multistep synthesis with over all low yields. In response to the demand to find alternative crosslinking units with the same features but more convenient synthesis, benzothiophen-dioxide derivatives as potential o-chinodimethane precursors were identified. Benzothiophene derivatives are well known structures to from o-chinodimethanes upon heating at 250° C. under the loss of SO2 and can be prepared in a number of different ways described in the literature. In contrast to known benzothiophene derivatives, a novel brome substituted benzothiophen-dioxide derivative was converted into the desired vinylbenzodevivate crosslinking monomer. In order to overcome difficult synthetic steps, a one step procedure was developed in which a modified Heck coupling reaction provides the vinyl derivative in high yields. Additionally, this novel reaction can be applied to the preparation of other monomer and is poised to open up novel opportunities to combine the crucial vinyl functionality to perform living free radical polymerization procedures with demanding moieties for the further utilization of macromolecules. The novel benzosulfone crosslinking unit was proved to be compatible with standard living free radical polymerization conditions. The intramolecular chain collapse process of polystyrene polymers with a variety of crosslinking units gave well defined monodisperse nanoparticles in the 5-10 nm dimension. 4. Compounds A.

Examples FD-1 and FD-2 As examples of the compounds of the invention, two non-peptidic fluorescently labeled Newkome-type dendrimers, differentiated over a varied alkylspacer with guanidine end moieties, were designed and synthesized. The assessment of internalization into mammalian cells using NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) showed that the spacer length at the terminal generation of the dendrimers can affect direction of cargo molecules precisely into specific subcellular compartments (e.g., nucleus or cytosol). Such direction can be particularly advantageous for the controlled intracellular delivery of bioactive cargo molecules into targeted locations. The two exemplary FITC-dendrimer conjugates were found to be highly water soluble and were further investigated for their capability to translocate through the cell membrane. Internalization of FD-1 and FD-2 in mammalian cells was assessed using two different cell lines and a previously described method [Futaki, S.; Nakase, I.; Suzuki, T.; Youjun, Y.; Sugiura, Y. Biochemistry 2002, 41, 7925.] with NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and HMEC (human microvascular endothelial cells) and a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. FIG. 2 shows the time course of uptake of FD-1 and FD-2 into NIH-3T3 Fibroblasts at 37° C. The fluorescence was clearly observed within the cells 2.5 min after the addition of conjugates to the medium, which is comparable to the uptake rate of Tat-peptide. [Futaki, S.; Nakase, I.; Suzuki, T.; Youjun, Y.; Sugiura, Y. Biochemistry 2002, 41, 7925; Vivès, E.; Brodin, P.; Lebleu, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997, 272, 16010.] Furthermore, the extent of internalization increased in an incubation time-dependent manner, and it was observed that after just 10 min, the fluorescence intensity of cells treated with FD-2 was near saturation. However, the fluorescence intensity of cells treated with FD-1 did not approach saturation until the longer time points (45 min-2 hr). Additionally, FD-1 and FD-2 exhibited differential patterns of subcellular localization, as FD-1 appeared to concentrate in the nucleus while FD-2 appeared to concentrate in the cytosol. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the length of the spacer at the terminal generation of the dendrimer can not only control the uptake rate, [Wender, P. A.; Kreider, E.; Pelkey, E. T.; Steinman, L.; Rothbard, J. B.; VanDeusen, C. L. Org. Lett. 2005, 7, 4815.] but also regulate the subcellular localization of the molecule and its putative cargo. For instance, the uptake levels of FD-2 appeared to be generally stronger than those of FD-1 after the same incubation time at the same concentration. Therefore, the dendrimer with a hexyl spacer crosses the cell membrane faster than the molecule with an ethyl chain. On the other hand, the localization patterns can also be controlled by the length of the spacer, FD-1 with the short spacer appeared to be localized everywhere in the cell, but highly concentrated in the nucleus. However, FD-2, with its longer spacer, was observed to reside mainly in the cytosol. These translocation features of guanidinlyated dendritic scaffolds as carriers can be important for intracellular delivery of cargo molecules to specific subcellular compartments (e.g., cytosol or nucleus). For example, a translocation approach that does not saturate the nucleus can be highly attractive as it can be both less cytotoxic and could afford cytosolic-targeted cargos with greater accuracy in delivery, and therefore higher efficacy. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the differential uptake patterns by FD-1 and FD-2 are due to the presence of a hexyl spacing chain in FD-2, resulting in a greater hydrophobicity of the entire conjugate as compared with FD-1. Additionally, the uptake of FD-1 and FD-2 conjugates by HMEC was also conducted. Entry of the two conjugates into HMEC shows a similar internalization pattern to that seen in fibroblasts. In control experiments, cells treated with free FITC and Boc-protected guanidinylated FITC-dendrimer showed no or extremely weak fluorescence, respectively. Therefore, the guanidino groups play an important role in the cell permeability of these molecules, while the length of the spacing chain determines both the differential rate of uptake and subcellular localization patterns. Although the mechanism of Tat translocation remains to be understood, it has been demonstrated that the rate of uptake is not temperature dependent. [Futaki, S.; Nakase, I.; Suzuki, T.; Youjun, Y.; Sugiura, Y. Biochemistry 2002, 41, 7925; Vivès, E.; Brodin, P.; Lebleu, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997, 272, 16010.] This indicates that endocytosis does not play a crucial role in the translocation process. Evaluation of the effect of temperature on the internalization of FD-1 and FD-2 indicated that the two conjugates are able to get into cells not only at 37° C., but also at 4° C., even at a lower dendrimer concentration (1 μM) (see FIGS. 3 and 4 in contrast to control experiments, as shown in FIG. 5). No significant decrease in fluorescence intensity of cells treated with FD-1 or FD-2 was observed, indicating that the uptake process does not occur via endocytosis. 11.
