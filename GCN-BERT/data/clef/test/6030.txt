Process and system for preparing dry milk formulae FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an advanced process for the manufacture of dairy products, preferably for the manufacture of dry milk formulae such as infant milk formulae and other nutritional products for infants, as well as to intermediary products obtainable by said process, uses of said intermediary products and a system for implementing said process. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Human milk is considered the ‘golden standard’ for infant nutrition. Processing animal milk, for example cows’ milk, to more resemble the composition of human milk is known in the art. Such processing is known in the art as ‘humanizing’ animal milk. The process of humanizing animal milk involves changing the ratio of caseimwhey proteins as found in animal milk (e.g. approximately 80:20 for cow’s milk) to the desired ratio for infant nutrition, as found in human milk (preferably between 75:25 and 30:70). In addition, the mineral content of animal milk is typically higher that the content found in human milk. Thus humanization of animal milk requires the reduction of the mineral content. Preparation of products suitable for use in infant nutrition typically involves blending of various individually purified components in the appropriate ratios, either wet or dry. Current manufacturing processes require multiple dairy ingredients from intermediate suppliers, including skim milk or a concentrate thereof (including skim milk powder), demineralised whey or a concentrate thereof (including demineralised whey powder), whey protein concentrates or isolates (normally as powders), and pure grade lactose (typically in powder form) to formulate a nutritionally balanced infant formula. WO 96/08155 describes a process for treating skim milk for the manufacture of cheese and milk powders, wherein whey proteins are removed from skim milk by microfiltration and further treatment includes ultrafiltration. US 5,503,865 discloses a process for treating skim milk, comprising microfiltration or ultrafiltration. The permeate thereof may be demineralised by for example ion exchange and/or electrodialysis in order to make it suitable to be used in baby products. US 4497836 discloses a process wherein whey is subjected to ultrafiltration, and the permeate thereof is subjected to electrodialysis or ion exchange. WO 2001/93689 discloses a process wherein milk serum is subjected to ultrafiltration, and the permeate thereof is subjected to diafiltration. The ultrafiltration retentate is combined with the diafiltration retentate in the production of infant milk formulae, by mixing the combined product with milk powder. ΕΡ 1133238 describes a process wherein animal milk is subjected to microfiltration through a membrane having a porosity of 0.1 - 0.2 micrometer, after which the microfiltration permeate comprising whey proteins is demineralised by electrodialysis. The mineral content of the electrodialyzed microfiltration permeate is very low, and subsequent fortification with minerals and trace elements is required to obtain an infant formula. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The inventors have designed an improved method for the production of dairy products, in particular for the production of dry (milk) powders, preferably dry (milk) powders for use in nutritional infant formulations, in which process more optimal use is made of filtration and separation technologies. In this process, a first liquid composition comprising 70 - 90 wt% casein and 10-30 wt% whey proteins, based on total protein, preferably animal skim milk, and a second liquid composition comprising sweet whey and/or acid whey are first subjected to separation by ultrafiltration, thereby reducing the need for (significant) polyvalent and/or monovalent ion removal from the casein and/or whey protein containing liquid compositions. The present invention thus preferably relates to a process for treating animal skim milk and whey, comprising the steps of ultrafiltrating animal skim milk and ultrafiltrating whey, preferably combined with softening and removal of monovalent ions of the lactose enriched ultrafiltration permeate streams and combining the obtained permeate and retentate streams. Present day manufacturers of dry powder (infant) nutritional compositions largely rely on supply and use of highly purified ingredients, such as purified lactose, demineralized whey proteins and casein proteins to produce said compositions by mixing said ingredients. The present inventors have designed a process of treating animal skim milk and whey for manufacturing a dry (milk) powder that largely circumvents buying such high-grade, pure ingredients from third parties. The advantages of the present process of the invention over such existing methods of producing dry (milk) powders are numerous; e.g. the loss in lactose during the processing of skim milk and whey is reduced, complications related to fouling of membranes are reduced, the use of (externally added) chemicals is reduced and waste water is recycled in the process to a large extent and thus overall the process has a lower environmental impact. More in particular, whereas lactose yield in conventional purification methods for the production of nutritional powders lies around 83-85%, yield can be improved to over 90% in the process of the present invention. More in particular, the present invention relates to a process for treating animal skim milk and whey, preferably for the manufacture of a dry powder, such as a dry powder that can be further processed into an infant milk formula and other nutritional products for infants. The present process involves ultrafiltration of animal skim milk and ultrafiltration of whey followed by mixing of the ultrafiltration retentates, which are enriched in milk proteins and whey proteins respectively. Adding whey to animal skim milk alters the protein composition of the skim milk, allowing the humanizing of skim milk to more resemble the protein composition of human milk. Both animal skim milk and whey typically contain too high levels of polyvalent ions, the content of which needs to be reduced in order to make the animal skim milk a suitable source of nutrients that can be used for feeding human infants. The process according to the present invention employs ultrafiltration for the removal of said polyvalent ions from animal skim milk and whey. As such, neither the animal skim milk nor whey need to be softened to the extent which is ordinarily done in the art. The process according to the invention circumvents the need for using (significantly) softened and/or demineralized whey proteins for the manufacture of dry powder formulations that are suitable for infant nutrition preparation, by ultrafiltration of animal skim milk and whey. In an especially preferred embodiment, the lactose that is removed from both the skim milk and whey as ultrafiltration permeate is softened or even demineralized, meaning the amounts of polyvalent ions and monovalent ions is reduced compared to the incoming material, after which the permeate is used to supplement the resulting dry powder formulations, by adding the demineralized lactose to either before, during or after mixing of the ultrafiltration retentates. As such, the mineral content of the resulting formulae is sufficiently low to enable infant nutrition preparation according to regulatory bodies (e.g. EU directive 91/321/EEC or EU directive 2006/141/EC, US Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Ch 1 part 107). More in particular, the present invention relates to a process for treating animal skim milk and sweet whey and/or acid whey, comprising: (a) ultrafiltration (UF1) of a first liquid composition comprising animal skim milk with 70 - 90 wt% casein and 10 - 30 wt% whey proteins, based on total protein, over a first ultrafiltration membrane having a molecular weight cut-off of 2.5 - 25 kDa using a volume concentration factor of 1.5 - 6 to obtain a retentate (UFR1) and a permeate (UFP1); (b) ultrafiltration (UF2) of a second liquid composition comprising sweet whey and/or acid whey over a second ultrafiltration membrane having a molecular weight cut-off of 2.5 25 kDa using a volume concentration factor of 2 - 15 to obtain a retentate (UFR2) and a permeate (UFP2); and (c) mixing the UF retentate originating from step (a) with the UF retentate originating from step (b) to obtain a mixture of UF retentates.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Process according to the present invention The present invention relates to a process for treating animal skim milk and sweet whey and/or acid whey, comprising: (a) ultrafiltration (UF1) of a first liquid composition comprising animal skim milk with 70 - 90 wt% casein and 10 - 30 wt% whey proteins, based on total protein, over a first ultrafiltration membrane having a molecular weight cut-off of 2.5 - 25 kDa using a volume concentration factor of 1.5 - 6 to obtain a retentate (UFR1) and a permeate (UFP1); (b) ultrafiltration (UF2) of a second liquid composition comprising sweet whey and/or acid whey over a second ultrafiltration membrane having a molecular weight cut-off of 2.5 25 kDa using a volume concentration factor of 2 - 15 to obtain a retentate (UFR2) and a permeate (UFP2); and (c) mixing the UF retentate originating from step (a) with the UF retentate originating from step (b) to obtain a mixture of UF retentates. In alternative wording, the present invention relates to a process for treating animal skim milk and sweet whey and/or acid whey, comprising: (a) ultrafiltration (UF1) of a first liquid composition comprising animal skim milk with 70 - 90 wt% casein and 10 - 30 wt% whey proteins, based on total protein, over a first ultrafiltration membrane having a molecular weight cut-off of 2.5 - 25 kDa to obtain a retentate (UFR1) comprising 35 - 65 wt% proteins and 20 - 50 wt% lactose, based on dry weight, and a permeate (UFP1) comprising 0-5 wt% proteins and 70 - 98 wt% lactose, based on dry weight; (b) ultrafiltration (UF2) of a second liquid composition comprising sweet whey and/or acid whey over a second ultrafiltration membrane having a molecular weight cut-off of 2.5 25 kDa to obtain a retentate (UFR2) comprising 15 - 55 wt% proteins and 35 - 65 wt% lactose, based on dry weight, and a permeate (UFP2) comprising 0-5 wt% proteins and 70 - 98 wt% lactose, based on dry weight; and (c) mixing the UF retentate originating from step (a) with the UF retentate originating from step (b) to obtain a mixture of UF retentates. The process according to the invention uses at least two sources of protein; the first is a liquid composition comprising animal skim milk with 70 - 90 wt% casein and 10 - 30 wt% whey proteins, based on total protein. Preferably, the first liquid composition comprises or is animal skim milk with a 80:20 casein to whey protein content ratio. Preferably, the second liquid composition comprises or is sweet whey and/or acid whey. More preferably the second liquid composition comprises or is sweet whey. In the process according to the invention, the first liquid composition and the second liquid composition are each subjected to ultrafiltration (UF, steps (a) and (b)) to obtain two UF retentates (UFR1 and UFR2) and two UF permeates (UFP1 and UFP2). In a preferred embodiment, any of the first liquid composition, the second liquid composition and the mixture of UF retentates originating from UF of the first and second liquid compositions may be subjected to various processing steps before the final diary product is obtained. In a preferred embodiment, the UFP1 permeate originating from step (a) is first mixed with the UFP2 permeate originating from step (b) (for example by collection in a single collection/storage tank) before removal of polyvalent ions in step (d) takes place. The softened UFP1/UFP2 combined permeate (/.℮. the mixed UFP1/UFP2 permeate that originate from the UF1/UF2 step which contains reduced polyvalent ions levels) is subsequently mixed with the UFR1 retentate that originates from UF1, the UFR2 retentate that originates from UF2, or preferably with the mixture of UF retentates of step (c). In a more preferred option, the UFR1 retentate that originates from (a), the UFR2 retentate that originates from (b), or preferably the mixture of UF retentates of step (c) is first subjected to a concentration step, preferably by reverse osmosis or nanofiltration, after which these more concentrated liquid compositions is/are combined with the softened UFP1/UFP2 combined permeate. An advantage of first mixing the UFP1 permeate that originates from UF1 with the UFP2 permeate that originates from UF2 is that polyvalent ions are removed from a single liquid composition (i.e. the UFP1/UFP2 permeate mixture) instead of that removing polyvalent ions involves removal from two separate liquid compositions. In yet another preferred embodiment, the process of the invention comprises step (j 1) or (j2). Herein, preferably the UF retentate originating from step (a) and/or the UF retentate originating from step (b) is/are subjected to a monovalent ion removal and/or concentrating step, prior to step (c), (℮) or (h), preferably by reverse osmosis and/or nanofiltration. Preferably, said UF retentates are separately subjected thereto. Alternatively, the mixture of UF retentates originating from step (c) is subjected to monovalent ion removal and/or concentration thereof, prior to step (h), preferably by reverse osmosis and/or nanofiltration. Preferably, at least one or both of the UF retentates of step (a) and (b) or the UF retentate of step (c) is/are subjected to at most one or at most two monovalent ion and/or concentration steps. In another preferred embodiment, the UFR1 retentate originating from UF1 is enriched in casein and whey proteins, the UFR2 retentate originating from UF2 is enriched in whey proteins, the mixture of UF retentates of step (c) is enriched in casein and whey protein, the UFP1 and UFP2 permeates originating from UF1 and UF2, respectively, are enriched in lactose. Furthermore, the mixture of UF retentates of step (c) is characterized by a casein to whey protein ratio that is shifted from the 80:20 weight ratio as observed in cows’ skim milk towards higher whey protein levels. Preferably, the casein protein to whey protein weight ratio thereof lies between 75 to 35 and 30 to 70. The process according to the invention provides sufficient removal of polyvalent ions and preferably monovalent ions, by virtue of the ultrafiltration of step (a) and (b) and optionally the softening of step (d), so that all minerals are on or below their required level for infant nutrition. In case the content of a certain mineral is below the required level, preferably that mineral is added. As the level of phosphate and sodium are particularly high in animal skim milk, the process according to the invention is designed as such that the content of phosphate and sodium is sufficiently reduced to enable infant nutrition preparation. Other ions may be removed to a greater extent and preferably are supplemented again to the final product. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention relate to a process for obtaining an infant formula, wherein, irrespective of the combining of the lactose in the softened UF permeate originating from step (d) with any of the UF retentates originating from step (a) and (b), additional supplementation of lactose may be desired to fulfill the requirements for infant nutrition. Ultrafiltration steps (a) and (b) In the process according to the invention, the first and second liquid compositions are subjected to an ultrafiltration step (a) and (b), wherein the liquid and small solutes permeate through the membrane and end up in the UF permeate (UFP1/UFP2), while the UF retentate (UFR1/UFR2) comprise substantially all protein, in a reduced volume when compared to the incoming liquid composition.

Both UFPs are rich in lactose, which is a valuable product for multiple purposes, for example it can optionally be reintroduced into the process at a later stage in a softened form which may also be subjected to a monovalent ion removal step. In an especially preferred embodiment, the lactose comprising UF permeate(s) is/are combined with the UF retentate originating from UF of step (a), with the UF retentate originating from UF of step (b) or with the a mixture of the UF retentates originating from UF of steps (a) and (b). Mixing step (c) In the process according to the invention, the UF retentate originating from UF of step (a) is combined and/or mixed with the UF retentate originating from UF of step (b). The (weight or volume) ratio in which the UF retentate originating from step (a), preferably comprising the protein material originating from animal skim milk, and the UF retentate originating from step (b), comprising whey proteins, are mixed is dependent on the protein composition of the incoming first liquid composition (e.g. animal milk is a nature product and the composition thereof may vary somewhat depending on seasons, or what the animals had been fed) but is mainly determined by the desired protein composition in the resulting dairy product. The skilled person is able to determine the protein composition and concentration of the incoming animal skim milk by methods known in the art, e.g. by the method according to FT001/IDF 20-3 (for total protein, Ν * 6.38), IDF29-1/ISO 17997-1:2004 (for casein) and FT003 (for whey, NCN, non-casein nitrogen * 6.38). In a preferred embodiment, the (weight or volume) ratio in which the UF retentate originating from step (a), is mixed or combined with the UF retentate originating from step (b) lies between 10:1 and 1:10, more preferably In a particularly preferred embodiment, the dry (milk) formula is further processed into a nutritional product for human infants such as infant formulae, weaning infant formulae, follow up milk or formulae, growing-up milk, toddler milk. In this respect, the resulting weight ratio of casein: whey protein after mixing of UF retentates originating from steps (a) and (b) is preferably between 75:25 and 30:70, more preferably between 70 to 30 and 36 to 64, more preferably between 65 to 35 and 45 to 55. The mixing of step (c) may be performed on liquid streams; e.g. the liquid UF retentate originating from step (a) can be mixed with the liquid UF retentate originating from step (b), giving a liquid UF retentate mixture comprising casein and whey proteins. Alternatively, one or both of the UF retentates originating from step (a) and (b) are dried prior to the mixing of step (c), and a liquid and a solid composition are mixed (e.g. by dissolving the solid in the liquid), giving a liquid mixed stream, or two solid streams are mixed (by dry blending), giving a solid mixed stream. In case drying is performed prior to mixing, it is preferred that both the skim milk UFR1 retentate stream and the retentate stream of the mixture comprising casein, sweet whey and/or acid whey are dried prior to mixing, and the resulting solids are dry blended. Preferably, the dried streams are powders. In an especially preferred embodiment, both retentate streams are liquid during mixing and the drying step is performed on the mixed retentate stream after the mixing step. The mixing of step (c) may be accomplished by any means known in the art, such as “in pipe” (i.e. by the joining of two incoming pipes into one single outgoing pipe), in a (balance) tank or vessel, in an agitated vessel or by any industrial mixer or blender known in the art. In case two liquid streams are mixed, dynamic mixing or static mixing may be employed. In case two dried streams (e.g. two powders) are mixed, a dry blender such as a ribbon blender, a paddle blender, a tumble blender and a vertical blender, may be employed. Preferably, the mixing step is performed on two liquid streams, preferably “in pipe” or in a balance tank. The ratio in which the UF retentate originating from step (a) is mixed with the UF retentate originating from step (b) is conveniently influenced by controlling the flow rate of the incoming compositions. Optional further processing steps on the UF retentates prior to or after mixing of step (c) Prior to the mixing of step (c), each of the UF retentates obtained in step (a) and (b) may be subjected to further processing steps, more preferably each of the UF retentates obtained in step (a) and (b) are subjected to further processing steps, prior to subjecting them to mixing in step (c). Such further processing steps include, preferably are limited to, concentrating the liquid composition in step (g) {i.e. increasing the protein/water weight ratio, e.g. via (partial) evaporation or filtration techniques such as nanofiltration or reverse osmosis), drying the liquid composition in step (h), heat treatment in step (i) (e.g. pasteurization (such as HTST, ESL or UHT) or sterilization (dry heat or moist heat) and/or supplementation of additional water or other components. It is especially preferred that the optional further processing steps of each of the UF retentates obtained in step (a) and (b) are limited to concentrating the liquid composition in step (g) {i.e. increasing the protein/water weight ratio, e.g. via (partial) evaporation or filtration techniques such as nanofiltration or reverse osmosis). In a preferred embodiment, the UF retentates originating from step (a) and/or (b) or step (c) is/are concentrated in step (jl) and (j2), respectively, using reverse osmosis (RO) or nanofiltration (NF), preferably nanofiltration, prior to the executing step (c), (℮) and/or (h). The concentration of step (jl) is typically performed over an NF membrane having a molecular weight cut-off of at most 500 Da, preferably at most 300 Da, and of at least 100 Da, preferably at least 150 Da, and typically operates with a VCF of 1.5 - 5, preferably 1.8 3. Alternatively, the VCF of the NF of step (jl) is preferably chosen as such, that the NFR has a total solid content of 5 - 30 %, more preferably 10 - 25 %, most preferably 16 - 20 %. The concentration of step (jl) is preferably performed below 40 °C, more preferably between 3 °C and 30 °C, even more preferably between 5 °C and 20 °C. Nanofiltration may be enhanced with diafiltration, i.e. at least once an additional volume of water is added to the thus treated permeate, and this diluted permeate is subjected to NF again. The NF or RO retentate, preferably the NF retentate, of the concentration of step (jl) of the animal skim milk composition originating from step (a) is a liquid composition typically comprising 30 - 75 wt% proteins (preferably 40 - 65 wt%, more preferable 45 - 60 wt%), 20- 50 wt% lactose (preferably 30 - 38 wt%), 0.1 - 0.5 wt% sodium (preferably 0.15-0.4 wt%), 0.3 - 2 wt% potassium (preferably 0.7 - 1.2 wt%), 0.01 - 0.5 wt% magnesium (preferably 0.05 - 0.2 wt%), 0.5 - 3 wt% calcium (preferably 1.2-2 wt%), 0.05 - 1 wt% chloride (preferably 0.1 - 0.4 wt%), 0.4 - 2.5 wt% phosphate (preferably 0.8 - 1.8 wt%), based on total dry weight of the composition, has a total ash content of preferably 2-13 wt%, more preferably 5-9 wt%, based on total dry weight of the composition, and has a total solid content of 5 - 30 %, more preferably 10 - 25 %, most preferably 16 - 20 %. The NF or RO retentate, preferably the NF retentate, of the concentration of step (jl) of the whey composition originating from step (b) is a liquid composition typically comprising 15 -55 wt% proteins (preferably 25 - 45 wt%, more preferable 30 - 40 wt%), 35 - 65 wt% lactose (preferably 45 - 55 wt%), 0.1-1 wt% sodium (preferably 0.15 - 0.5 wt%), 0.3 - 2 wt% potassium (preferably 0.6 - 1 wt%), 0.01 - 0.5 wt% magnesium (preferably 0.05 - 0.2 wt%), 0.2 - 3 wt% calcium (preferably 1.2-2 wt%), 0.05 - 1 wt% chloride (preferably 0.1 - 0.4 wt%), 0.1 - 1.5 wt% phosphate (preferably 0.4 - 0.8 wt%), based on total dry weight of the composition, has a total ash content of preferably 1-13 wt%, more preferably 5-9 wt%, based on total dry weight of the composition, and has a total solid content of 5 - 30 %, more preferably 10 - 25 %, most preferably 16 - 20 %. In an especially preferred embodiment, both the UF retentate originating from step (a) and the UF retentate originating from step (b) are subjected to concentration step (jl) prior to the mixing of step (c) and the optionally drying of step (h). It is also possible to concentrate the mixture of UF retentates originating from step (c) in step (j2). Preferably, the UF retentate originating from step (a), (b) and/or (c) is/are not subjected to a polyvalent ion removal step after ultrafiltration. Preferably, these UF retentates are not subjected to electrodialysis, ion exchange and/or salt precipitation since a sufficient amount of the polyvalent ions are diverted into the UF permeates. At least one of the UF retentates obtained in step (a), (b) and/or (c), optionally after the concentration of steps (jl) or (j2), may also be dried in step (h) prior to the mixing of step (c). As such, the UF retentate originating from step (a) and the UF retentate originating from step (b) are each dried separately, both preferably into a powder. Alternatively, drying may also occur prior to the mixing of step (c) on only one of the UF retentates, after which the dried UF retentate, preferably in the form of a powder, is mixed with the non-dried UF retentate. In the latter case, an additional drying step is preferably needed to dry the mixture of the UF retentates originating from step (c) in order to obtain a dry (milk) formula. In a preferred embodiment, the mixture of UF retentates originating from step (c) are dried in step (h), and each of the UF retentate originating from step (a) and the UF retentate originating from step (b) are not dried prior to the mixing of step (c). Preferably, the drying of step (h) dries the mixture of UF retentates originating from step (c) into a powder, preferably by spray-drying. When the drying of step (h) occurs after the mixing of step (c), the least amount of drying steps is required; namely only involving the mixture of UF retentates originating from step (c). As alternative to drying, the mixture of UF retentates originating from step (c) may remain liquid, optionally after concentration and/or dilution. This liquid mixed product may also be further processed into liquid nutritional products, preferably products suitable for feeding infants, e.g. as ready-to-use infant formulae. After the mixing of step (c) and optionally the drying of step (h), the process according to the invention yields a dairy product, preferably a dry (milk) formula, preferably in the form of a powder. Preferably, this dry (milk) formula is further processed into a nutritional product suitable for providing nutrition to a human infant, in particular an infant between 0 and 36 months of age. Further processing typically comprises addition of further ingredients as known in the art to the dairy product, in particular one or more selected from vitamins, minerals, lipids, prebiotics, probiotics, lactose. Where appropriate, those ingredients may also be added to a liquid composition (either prior to the drying of step (h), or in case no drying step is performed), such as any of the UF retentate originating from step (a) and (b) and optionally to the softened UF permeate originating from step (d), or even to any of the incoming first and second liquid compositions. The skilled person is well aware of the beneficial ingredients for infant nutrition, and how they are best blended with the protein fraction. The drying of step (h) may be accomplished by any means known in the art, e.g. spray drying, (fluidized) bed drying, drum drying, freeze drying, roller drying, etc. In an especially preferred embodiment, drying is accomplished using spray drying, optionally preceded by partial evaporation of the liquid (e.g. by nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, evaporation). Optional further process steps on the UF permeates Ultrafiltration of the first liquid composition in step (a) and of the second liquid composition in step (b) affords two ultrafiltration permeates (UFP1 and UFP2) that each comprise lactose. In a preferred embodiment, at least one of, preferably both of, these UF permeates is/are further processed and combined in step (℮) with one of the UF retentates originating from step (a) or (b), or to the mixture of the UF retentates originating from step (c). The UF permeate originating from step (a) and from step (b) may be combined prior to further processing, or the further processing is performed on only one of the UF permeates, or each of the permeates separately. Preferably, the UF permeates originating from step (a) and (b) are first combined, after which the combined UF permeates, which are referred to as the “combined UFP1/UFP2” is further processed as described herein. Preferably, the UF permeate originating from step (a), (b) and/or the combined UFP1/UFP2, has undergone further treatment before it is mixed with the UF retentate originating from step (a) and/or (b), or the mixture or UF retentates originating from step (c). Such further treatment preferably comprises subjecting any of these permeates to softening or polyvalent ion removal in optional step (d). Softening of any of the permeates affords a softened UF permeate. It is noted here that the “softened UF permeate” refers to a lactose comprising (preferably lactose enriched) composition that originates from the UF of step (a) and/or (b) as a permeate from which polyvalent and optionally monovalent ions have been removed e.g. by step (f). Softening of at least one of the UF permeates originating from step (a) and/or (b) is preferably accompanied with or followed by the removal of monovalent ions. Removal of monovalent ions of at least one of the UF permeates originating from step (a) and/or (b) is especially preferred in case the dairy product obtained by the process according to the invention is further processed into a nutritional product suitable for infant nutrition. Polyvalent ion removal, monovalent ion removal and/or concentration (e.g. step (d), (f), (g) and (jl)/(J2)) may be accomplished using any technique known in the art, such as electrodialysis, ion exchange, salt precipitation, lactose crystallization, membrane filtration techniques such as nanofiltration, optionally enhanced with diafiltration, or combinations thereof. In the context of the present invention, polyvalent ion removal, optionally combined with monovalent ion removal, also includes the crystallisation of lactose from a liquid UF permeate originating from step (a) and/or (b) and simultaneously keeping (significant amounts of) the polyvalent ions and preferably (significant amounts of) the monovalent ions in solution. The obtained crystalline lactose is regarded to be a softened UF permeate in the context of the present invention, as it originates from the UF of step (a) and has (significant amounts of) the polyvalent ions removed. In an especially preferred embodiment, removal of polyvalent ions of step (d), removal of monovalent ions of step (f) and concentration of step (g) is performed by a combination of steps comprising nanofiltration, salt precipitation and precipitate removal. Preferably, this combination of steps also comprises electrodialysis. More preferably, removal of polyvalent ions is performed in the following order: nanofiltration, salt precipitation and precipitate removal. Preferably, the precipitate removal is followed by a further nanofiltration step (preferably enhanced with diafiltration) or by electrodialysis, most preferably it is followed by electrodialysis. Thus, it is preferred that the process of the invention involves the steps of subjecting the UF permeate originating from step (a), (b) and/or the combined UFP1/UFP2 to nanofiltration, subjecting the nanofiltration retentate to salt precipitation and subsequently removal of the precipitates therefrom (preferably by ultrafiltration), and subjecting the precipitate-depleted composition to electrodialysis (preferably enhanced with diafiltration). Alternatively, it is preferred that the process of the invention involves the steps of subjecting the UF permeate originating from step (a), (b) and/or the combined UFP1/UFP2 to nanofiltration, subjecting the nanofiltration retentate to salt precipitation and subsequently removal of the precipitates therefrom (preferably by ultrafiltration), and subjecting the precipitate-depleted composition to a further nanofiltration step (preferably enhanced with diafiltration). The step of subjecting the UF permeate originating from step (a), and/or of the UF permeate originating from step (b) or of a mixture of the UF permeates originating from step (a) and (b) to nanofiltration, as part of this embodiment, mainly accomplishes monovalent ion removal and concentration. Thus, nanofiltration may be regarded the monovalent ion removal of step (f) combined with the concentration of step (g). Nanofiltration is preferably performed using at least one NF membrane, more preferably at least one spiral wound membrane, wherein the membrane preferably has a molecular-weight cut-off of 10 - 600 Da, more preferably 100 - 400 Da, whereby the VCF is typically chosen such that the total solid content of the NF retentate is in the range of 15 - 35 wt%, preferably in the range of 20 - 25 wt%, most preferably about 22 wt%. NF is preferably operated at a VCF of 2 - 8, more preferably 3-6. NF of step (dl) is preferably performed below 40 °C, more preferably in the range of 3 °C - 30 °C, even more preferably in the range of 5 °C - 20 °C. The NF retentate is subsequently subjected to salt precipitation, which is mainly aimed at removal of polyvalent ions, in particular phosphate ions such as calcium phosphate. It is especially desirably to lower the phosphate content of the incoming animal skim milk and animal whey when the process of the invention is used to manufacture infant nutrition or a base for infant nutrition. The salt precipitation may thus be regarded as part of the polyvalent ion removal of step (d), and can be achieved by creating suitable conditions under which polyvalent ions precipitate from the lactose-enriched liquid. These conditions include addition of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide, pH adjustment to a neutral pH, such as between 6 and 9, preferably between 6.8 and 9.0, and increasing the temperature to between 70 and 90 °C, which is preferably followed by decreasing the temperature to between 5 and 30 °C. Salt precipitation preferably is accomplished by heating the NF retentate to a temperature of 70 °C - 90 °C, preferably of 75 °C - 88 °C, most preferably of 80 °C - 85 °C. At such temperatures, at least part of the calcium phosphate precipitates, which is visible as a white precipitate. Higher temperatures are generally unsuitable, as they may cause undesirable enzymatic browning. Heating may occur by any means known in the art, and is preferably accomplished by steam injection into the NF retentate or by using a heat exchanger (e.g. a plate heat exchanger). Calcium phosphate precipitation may be enhanced, meaning that a greater fraction of the calcium phosphate precipitates, by increasing the pH of the heated NF retentate to a value above 6.5, preferably in the range of 6.8 - 9.0, more preferably in the range of 6.8 - 7.4, and/or by adding other calcium salts such as calcium chloride. The NF retentate typically has a pH of 6.0 - 6.5, and increasing this to above 6.5, preferably in the range of 6.8 - 9.0, more preferably in the range of 6.8 7.4, can be accomplished by addition of a base, preferably an aqueous solution of a metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and/or calcium hydroxide. Preferably, a concentrated solution sodium hydroxide is used, more preferably a 20 - 35 % (w/v) solution of NaOH in water. Only little of the base solution is needed, as the components that may act as buffer are removed by NF. As guidance, typically about 0.1-1 wt% based on the total weight of the NF retentate, preferably 0.3 - 0.5 wt% based on the total weight of the NF retentate, of a solution of about 30 % (w/v) NaOH in water is used. The skilled person is capable to adjust this value for variations in pH of the NF retentate, different types of base and different concentrations. As the calcium content should not necessarily be reduced as much as the phosphate content of the UF permeate originating from step (a), and/or of the UF permeate originating from step (b) or of a mixture of the UF permeates originating from step (a) and (b), in order to prepare infant nutrition with both calcium and phosphate on or below desired values, some additional calcium, preferably in the form of calcium chloride, calcium citrate, calcium lactate, calcium hydroxide, or mixtures thereof, preferably calcium chloride, can be added to the heated NF retentate, which induces the precipitation of more calcium phosphate. Using calcium hydroxide preferably achieves both the pH increase and addition of a calcium salt, but its suitability is slightly hampered by its low solubility. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, a mixture of calcium chloride and sodium hydroxide is added to the NF retentate to enhance calcium phosphate precipitation. As such, the softened UFP will have a phosphate content which is further reduced compared to the calcium content. Suitably, the NF retentate is subsequently cooled to a temperature below 30 °C, preferably in the range of 5 °C - 30 °C, more preferably in the range of 8 °C - 25 °C, most preferably in the range of 8 °C - 15 °C, before the precipitate is removed from the NF retentate. Rapidly cooling the NF retentate is especially preferred, to reduce the chances on undesirable bacterial growth and to minimize the resolubilization of calcium phosphate. Although less preferred, the precipitate may also be removed from the NF retentate at an elevated temperature, for example at a temperature above 25 °C. Subsequently, the precipitates may be removed by any technique known in the art (e.g. centrifugal separation, decantation in a settling tank, filtration, for example microfiltration or ultrafiltration). Preferably, the precipitate removal step is performed by filtration, more preferably by ultrafiltration, which permeates the lactose and soluble minerals and retains the precipitate which predominantly comprises calcium phosphate. The primary aim of this precipitate removal is thus to remove precipitates and not to fractionate any other material, and may thus be regarded as part of the polyvalent ion removal of step (d). Any UF membrane as known in the art may be used, but also a UF bed. Preferably, at least one UF membrane with a molecular-weight cut-off of preferably 1 kDa - 50 kDa, more preferably 5 - 20 Da is used. UF preferably operates at a VCF of 5 - 40, more preferably 7-35, most preferably 10 - 30. Good results are obtained using a VCF of about 10, but lactose yields in the outflowing softened UFP may be further increased without deteriorating the efficacy of process by increasing the VCF to up to 40. Thus, the UF permeate comprises substantially all lactose as originally present in the incoming UF permeate(s) originating from step (a) and/or (b). The NF retentate which has been subjected to precipitate removal (e.g. the UF permeate) is referred to in the context of this embodiment as the precipitate-depleted UF permeate(s). It is preferred that the resulting precipitate-depleted UF permeate(s) is/are further desalted in a further nanofiltration step and/or an electrodialysis step, most preferably in an electrodialysis step. The electrodialysis (ED) step as part of this embodiment may be regarded part of the polyvalent ion removal of step (d) and part of the monovalent ion removal of step (f), and is preferably performed on an incoming flow comprising between 18 and 24 % w/w solids content. ED is preferably operated until the conductivity of the outflowing (lactose enriched) liquid reaches a value below 4 mS, preferably below 2 mS, even more preferably below 1 mS and/or until the ash content reaches a value of below 3 wt%, more preferably below 2 wt%, most preferably below 1 wt%, based on total weight of the outflowing liquid. The skilled person understands how to adjust the electrodialysis settings to achieve this goal. In case a further nanofiltration step is employed, NF is preferable conducted using the parameters (i.e. membrane type and porosity, VCF and temperature) as described above for the NF step on the incoming UF permeate(s) originating from step (a) and/or (b). Preferably, the NF is enhanced with diafiltration, i.e. at least once an additional volume of water is added to the NF permeate, and this diluted thus treated permeate is subjected to NF again. The NF is preferably performed such that the NF retentate has a total solid content of 16 - 28 wt%, preferably 18-22 wt%. The resulting lactose-enriched outflowing liquid of this preferred sequence of steps for the combined removal of polyvalent ions of step (d), removal of monovalent ions of step (f) and concentration of step (g), i.e. the precipitate-depleted UF permeate (preferably obtained as a UF permeate) obtained in the precipitate removal step, the outflowing liquid obtained in the ED step or the NF retentate obtained in the further NF step, preferably the outflowing liquid of the ED step, is referred to as the softened UF permeate in step (d) and can be used in step (℮)· The polyvalent ion removal of step (d) enables the removal of significant amounts of the polyvalent ions. Preferably at least 50 wt%, more preferably at least 70 wt% or at least 80 wt%, most preferably at least 90 wt% of the polyvalent ions are removed. The weight percentage (wt%) of polyvalent ion removal is determined by comparing the total weight of polyvalent ions present after step (b) to the total weight of polyvalent ions present prior to step (d). Likewise, a monovalent ion removal step enables the removal of significant amounts of the monovalent ions. Preferably, at least 20 wt% of the monovalent ions are removed, more preferably at least 35 wt% or at least 50 wt%, most preferably at least 60 wt% of the monovalent ions are removed. Thus, the softened UF permeate preferably comprises at least 20 wt% less monovalent ions, preferably at least 35 wt% less, more preferably at least 50 wt% less, most preferably at least 60 wt% less monovalent ions, when compared to the incoming UF permeate originating from step (a). Each of the UF permeates originating from the UF of step (a) and (b), either separately or as mixture, may undergo further processing steps prior to being subjected to the polyvalent ion removal of step (d). Such optional further processing steps include, preferably are limited to, concentrating the liquid stream (i.e. increasing the lactose/water weight ratio) by any suitable means known in the art (e.g. by (partial) evaporation or filtration techniques such as reverse osmosis), heat treatment (e.g. pasteurization (such as HTST, ESL or UHT) or sterilization (dry heat or moist heat)) and/or supplementation of additional water or other components. Concentration may also be accomplished during the removal of monovalent ions, e.g. during nanofiltration, optionally enhanced with diafiltration. In an especially preferred embodiment, removal of monovalent ions from the UF permeate originating from step (a) and/or (b), or the combined UFP1/UFP2 is performed on any softened permeate originating from step (d) by nanofiltration (NF). Using this sequence of steps, the nanofiltration retentate (NFR) is considered to be the softened UF permeate (as this is enriched in lactose), which may then be combined with any of the UF retentates in step (℮). During the ion exchange of step (d), the polyvalent ions (e.g. Mg2+, Ca2+, PO43") are replaced by monovalent ions (typically Na+, K+, Cf), and during nanofiltration these monovalent ions permeate through the nanofiltration membrane. Preferably, nanofiltration is enhanced with diafiltration, i.e. at least once an additional volume of water is added to this permeate, and this diluted thus treated permeate is subjected to NF again. Conveniently, the NF permeate which comprises monovalent ions and is substantially free of lactose, may be used to regenerate the ion exchange column(s). Nanofiltration of the (softened) UF permeate originating from step (a) and/or step (b), or of the combined UFP1/UFP2, may be performed using a spiral wound membrane having a molecular weight cut-off of at most 500 Da, preferably at most 300 Da, and of at least 100 Da, preferably at least 150 Da, is used. The NF step typically operates with a VCF of 1.1 5, preferably 1.2-4, more preferably at 1.4 to 3. Alternatively, the VCF of the NF step is preferably chosen as such, that the NFR has a total solid content of 14 - 35 %, more preferably 20 - 30 %. The NF step is preferably performed below 40 °C, more preferably between 3 °C and 30 °C, even more preferably between 5 °C and 20 °C. Preferably, nanofiltration is enhanced with diafiltration. One or more additional volumes of water, typically 50 - 100 vol% of the volume of the incoming stream of the NF step (outgoing stream of the ion exchange step), preferably 60 - 80 vol%, are added to the NFR, which is subsequently pushed through the NF membrane together with residual monovalent ions from the NFR. Preferably, at least two additional volumes of water are added to the NFR. An additional advantage of using NF is that large amounts of water can be removed by this cost-effective membrane filtration technique, without the need for evaporation. The composition of the UF permeate originating from step (a) and/or the UF permeate originating from step (b), or the composition of the combined UFP1/UFP2 may vary to a limited extent depending on the exact composition of the first liquid composition (e.g. what type of animal skim milk is used, which animal, seasonal variations). For example, new season bovine milk comprises somewhat higher levels of sodium compared to bovine milk from later in the season. Typically, the UF permeate originating from step (a) and/or the UF permeate originating from step (b), or the combined UFP1/UFP2 prior to softening is a liquid composition typically comprising 70 - 98 wt% lactose (preferably 80 - 92 wt%), 0.2 - 2 wt% sodium (preferably 0.5-1 wt%), 1-5 wt% potassium (preferably 2-3.5 wt%), 0.01 - 0.5 wt% magnesium (preferably 0.05 - 0.2 wt%), 0.1-2 wt% calcium (preferably 0.25 - 1 wt%), 0.5 - 3.5 wt% chloride (preferably 1.2 - 2.5 wt%), 0.2 - 2 wt% phosphorous (preferably 0.5 - 1.5 wt%), based on total dry weight of the composition, has a total ash content of preferably 4-17 wt%, more preferably 7-12 wt%, based on total dry weight of the composition, and preferably has a total solid content of 2 - 15 %, more preferably 3.5 10 %, most preferably 4.5-6 %.

Each of the ions mentioned here is preferably substantially absent from these softened UF permeate after softening or monovalent ion removal. In case the total solid content of any of the softened UF permeate is relatively low, e.g. below 10 % or below 15 %, the softened UF permeate may be concentrated to achieve a total solid content of preferably 10 - 30 %, more preferably 18-28 %, before being combined in step (℮). Concentration may be accomplished by any means known in the art. Preferably, concentration is accomplished using reverse osmosis.

The softened UF permeate originating from step (d), having the above characteristics, is ideally suited to be added to the UF retentate originating from step (a) and/or the UF retentate originating from step (b), or preferably to be added to the mixture of UF retentates originating from step (c), for the preparation of dairy products, preferably (dry) milk formulae, in particular for the preparation of a nutritional product for providing nutrition to infants. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, the softened UF permeate originating from step (d) is combined in step (℮) with the UF retentate originating from step (a) and/or the UF retentate originating from step (b), or to the mixture of UF retentates originating from step (c). Most preferably the softened UF permeate originating from step (d) is combined in step (℮) during or after the mixing of step (c), thus either with the mixture of UF retentates in step (c), or with the mixture of UF retentates originating from step (c). In a preferred embodiment, at least 80 wt%, more preferably at least 90 wt% or even at least 95 wt%, most preferably at least 98 wt% of the lactose that is obtained in the UF permeates originating from step (a) and (b) is combined in step (℮) with the UF retentates originating from step (a) and (b). The lactose content in a liquid composition can readily be determined by skilled person, e.g. enzymatically or by HPLC. The process according to the invention affords residual water at several points, e.g. from the drying step, the optionally as nanofiltration permeates and/or the reverse osmosis permeates. In a preferred embodiment, this residual water, optionally after further purification by e.g. reverse osmosis, is recycled in the process according to the invention, e.g. used to dilute or reconstitute the first liquid composition (preferably the animal skim milk) and/or the second liquid composition comprising sweet whey and/or acid whey starting material, or as diafiltration water. Definitions The term “sweet whey” herein refers to the liquid (whey protein containing) by-product of the cheese manufacture industry which makes use of enzymatic cheese curd formation (e.g. based on casein precipitation using rennet), which material is readily accessible in the commercial market. Typically, whey proteins present in sweet whey include, i.a. beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin, bovine serum albumin, immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and glycomacroprotein Conversely, the term “acid whey” herein refers to the liquid (whey protein containing) by-product of the cheese manufacture industry which makes use of (edible) acids for cheese curd formation (e.g. based on casein precipitation using acids such as citric acid), which material is readily accessible in the commercial market. Typically, whey proteins present in acid whey include, i.a. beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin, bovine serum albumin, immunoglobulins, lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase The term "casein" herein refers to casein or caseinate proteins as found in animal skim milk, such as bovine skim milk, more in particular cows' skim milk. Preferably, casein or caseinate is in substantially intact, non-hydrolyzed form. As used herein, the term “polyvalent ions” refers to ions having a positive or negative charge of two or more. More in particular, this term refers to Mg2+, Ca2+ and polyvalent phosphate anions (e.g. HPO42", PO43"). The term “monovalent ions” refers to ions having a positive or negative charge of one, in particular Na+, K+, Cf. The term “removal of polyvalent ions” means that said polyvalent ions are removed from the UF permeate composition which is subjected to the polyvalent ion removal step (step (d)). Preferably, the term “removal of polyvalent ions” indicates that at least 10 or 20 wt% of the polyvalent ions that are present in said UF permeate (on dry weight basis thereof) is removed, preferably at least 50 wt%, 60 wt%, more preferably 70 wt% or at least 80 wt%, most preferably at least 90 wt%. The weight percentage (wt%) of polyvalent ion removal is determined by comparing the total weight of polyvalent ions present after step (c) to the total weight of polyvalent ions present prior to step (c). Likewise, the term “softening” is used to denote the removal of polyvalent ions. Hence, herein “softening” and “removal of polyvalent ions” is used interchangeably. Analogously, the term “softened” is used to refer to a composition from which polyvalent ions have been removed. “Significant polyvalent ion removal” denotes the removal of at least 70 wt% of the polyvalent ions, preferably at least 85 wt%, more preferably at least 95 wt% or even at least 99 wt% of the polyvalent ions. Polyvalent ion removal or softening may be accompanied with monovalent ion removal, either in the same step or in a separate step. Preferably, polyvalent ion removal refers to removal of at least or all of calcium, magnesium and/or phosphate species to the extent as defined in this paragraph. The term “removal of monovalent ions” means that said monovalent ions are removed from the composition which is subjected to the monovalent ion removal step (preferably a softened UF permeate and/or any UF retentate). In case not indicated otherwise, preferably at least 10 or 20 wt% (on dry weight basis) of the monovalent ions is removed from the composition which was subjected to a monovalent ion removal step, more preferably at least 35 wt% or 50 wt%, most preferably at least 60 wt%. Removal of monovalent ions is particularly preferred in case the process according to the invention aims to manufacture dry powder formulations intended for use as infant nutrition. “Significant monovalent ion removal” denotes the removal of at least 70 wt% of the monovalent ions, preferably at least 85 wt%, more preferably at least 95 wt% or even at least 99 wt% of the monovalent ions. Preferably, monovalent ion removal refers to removal of at least or all of sodium, potassium and/or chloride to the extent as defined in this paragraph. As used herein, the term “enriched” herein refers to the situation wherein the amount of a certain constituent of a (liquid) composition (as wt% based on dry weight) is higher after a process step, when compared to the content of the same ingredient in the (liquid) composition before said process step. Preferably, the dry weight percentage of an ingredient that is enriched has a content in a stream discharged from the process step of at least 110 %, more preferably at least 125%, most preferably at least 150 %, based on the dry weight percentage of said ingredient in the incoming stream of said process step. Exemplary is the ultrafiltration of skim milk, wherein the milk proteins are retained in the retentate while water and small solutes permeate through the ultrafiltration membrane. As such, any UF retentate is enriched in casein and whey proteins, as the content thereof in the retentate, as wt% based on dry weight of the composition, is increased compared to the wt% thereof in skim milk, as less small solutes are present. Likewise, the permeate is enriched in small solutes (e.g. enriched in lactose), as the amount of proteins is significantly reduced in the permeate, and lactose constitutes by far the largest part of the dry weight of the permeate. The “total solid content” of a liquid composition denotes the weight percentage of solids present in the composition, based on the total weight of the composition. Solids include all non-volatiles, typically everything except water. The “volume concentration factor” or “VCF” is the factor at which a liquid composition is concentrated upon filtration, i.e. the total volume of the incoming stream prior to filtration divided by the total volume of the retentate after filtration, irrespective of the total solid content. Thus, when 5 L of a liquid composition is fractionated over an ultrafiltration membrane into a permeate of 4 L and a retentate of 1 L, this UF process operates with a VCF of 5/1 = 5. By a “UF retentate originating from” is meant the liquid retentate composition that is (directly) obtained from ultrafiltration steps (a) and (b). The term also refers to the UF retentates that are mixed in step (c) to obtain the mixture of UF retentates. Irrespective of whether between the obtaining of the UF retentate from step (a) and (b) and the mixing in step (c) or step (℮) or drying in step (h), the UF retentate is subjected to a concentration step, such as reverse osmosis or nanofiltration, the term UF retentate still applies to this UF fraction. Thus, the term UF retentate is meant to denote the (protein enriched) fraction that is processed according to the steps of the invention from the ultrafiltration step up to the point where it is (re)combined with a UF permeate. Similarly, the term “UF permeate originating from” herein means the liquid permeate composition that is (directly) obtained from ultrafiltration steps (a) and (b). The term also refers to the UF permeates that are conveyed as (liquid) compositions from the ultrafiltration step to the polyvalent ion removal module for execution of step (d), or to the monovalent ion removal module for execution of step (f) and/or any optional concentration step or module to eventually obtain the combined permeate/retentate product of step (℮) or to obtain the dry powder in step (h). Irrespective of whether between the obtaining of the UF permeate from step (a) and (b) and the mixing in step (℮) or drying in step (h), the UF permeate is subjected to a processing step (e.g. a polyvalent ion removal step, a concentration step, reverse osmosis and/or nanofiltration), within the context of the present invention the term UF permeate still applies to this UF fraction. Thus, the term UF permeate is meant to denote the (lactose enriched) fraction that is processed according to the steps of the invention from the ultrafiltration step up to the point where it is (re)combined with a UF retentate. In the context of the present invention, a dry formula has a water content of at most 6 wt%, preferably 1-4 wt%, more preferably 2-3 wt%, based on total weight of the composition. The dry formula may be further processed into nutritional products, preferably products suitable for feeding human infants.

The invention will now be illustrated by several examples which are not meant to limit the invention in any manner. EXAMPLES Example 1 400 kg of pasteurized cows’ skim milk with a casein to whey protein weight ratio of 80:20 was subjected to ultrafiltration over a Synder ST3838 UF membrane having a MWCO of 10 kDa. Ultrafiltration was performed at a temperature between 8 and 10 °C, with a transmembrane pressure of 2 bar and a VCF of about 2. The permeate was collected in a flow rate of up to 260 L/h. 208 kg of a UF permeate (UFP1) and 211 kg of a UF retentate (UFR1) was obtained. The compositions of the incoming skim milk and the products of the ultrafiltration are given in table 1. The slight increase in total weight of the final products (UFR1 and UFP1) compared to the incoming skim milk can be attributed to dilution of the plant dead volume during the changeover from product to water during plant flushing. As can be seen from the data of table 1, the UF retentate is enriched in proteins, whereas the UF permeate is enriched in lactose.

Ultrafiltration was performed at a temperature between 10 and 12 °C, and with a transmembrane pressure of 2 bar and a VCF of about 5. The permeate was collected in a flow rate of up to 400 L/h. 818 kg of a UF permeate (UFP2) and 195 kg of a UF retentate (UFR2) was obtained. The compositions of the incoming sweet whey and the products of the ultrafiltration are given in table 2.

The softened UFP was concentrated to a final total solid content of about 20 ℅. 178 kg of a softened UFP concentrate was obtained as a nanofiltration retentate (NFR1), together with 1225 kg of a nanofiltration permeate (NFP1). The compositions of the incoming combined UFP and the products of the nanofiltration are given in table 3.

The permeate was collected in a flow rate of up to 220 L/h. 108 kg of an UFR1 concentrate as nano filtration retentate (NFR2) was obtained, together with 149 kg of a nanofiltration permeate (NFP2). Using nanofiltration, the UFR1 is concentrated to a total solid content of about 18 %. The composition of the NFR2 product of the nanofiltration is given in table 4.

Nanofiltration operated at a temperature between 8 and 20 °C, and with a transmembrane pressure of 2 bar. The permeate was collected in a flow rate of up to 400 L/h. 73 kg of an UFR2 concentrate as nanofiltration retentate (NFR3) was obtained, together with 148 kg of a nanofiltration permeate (NFP3). Using nanofiltration, the UFR2 is concentrated to a total solid content of about 18 %. The composition of the NFR3 product of the nanofiltration is given in table 5.

To this end, the UFR1 concentrate of example 4 (NFR2) is mixed with the UFR2 concentrate of example 5 (NFR3) in a weight ratio of 59 kg:87.62 kg (based on a liquid composition) or in a weight ratio of 10.59 kg: 16.45 kg (based on a dry composition) respectively, to produce a mixture of UFR1 and UFR2. Besides the in table 6 mentioned constituents, the NFR2/NFR3 mixture comprises ΝΡΝ at 2.82 wt% and fat at 3.08 wt%.

Addition of a softened and optionally concentrated UF permeate (which is substantially free from proteins) allows one to increase the amount of lactose to a desired level. The obtained mixture can be spray-dried into a dry milk formula. For instance, addition of suitable amounts of required nutrients and minerals, where needed, allows one to obtain a growing-up formula with a 40:60 casein to whey protein ratio. Alternative mixtures of UFR1 and UFR2 were made to produce other mixtures of UFR1 and UFR2 that comprised a 50:50 and 60:40 casein to whey ratio. Example 7 A softened UFP concentrate was recombined with the mixture of UFR1 and UFR2 to produce a composition with a 60:40 casein to whey protein ratio. The softened UFP concentrate was combined with the mixture of UFR1 and UFR2. The UFR1 concentrate of example 4 (NFR2), the UFR2 concentrate of example 5 (NFR3) and the softened UFP concentrate (NFR1) of example 3 are mixed in a weight ratio of 88.51 kg:43.81 kg:188.77 kg (based on a liquid composition) or in a weight ratio of 15.88 kg:8.23 kg:38.57 kg (based on a dry composition) respectively, to produce a mixture of UFR1, UFR2 and softened UFP. Besides the in table 7 mentioned constituents, the NFR1/NFR2/NFR3 mixture comprises ΝΡΝ at 1.67 wt% and fat at 1.01 wt%. Table 7: Composition of example 7 (in wt% based on total dry weight) component NFR1/NFR2/NFR3 mixture protein 18.8 lactose 74.9 ash 4.2 -Na 0.49 -Κ 0.58 -Cl 0.62 -Ρ 0.56 -Ca 0.55 -Mg 0.05 Combining the softened UFP concentrate with the mixture of UFR1 and UFR2 in other selected weight ratios allows obtaining a mixture which comprises casein to whey proteins in a desired ratio that falls within the claimed range. The addition of the softened and optionally concentrated UF permeate (which is substantially free from proteins) allows to increase the amount of lactose to a higher levels as shown. The obtained mixture can be spray-dried into a dry milk formula. For instance, addition of suitable amounts of required nutrients and minerals, where needed, allows one to obtain a growing-up formula with a 60:40 casein to whey protein ratio. Alternative mixtures where made in a similar fashion to obtain compositions that comprised a 50:50 and 40:60 casein to whey ratio. Example 8 Fractionation of reconstituted skim milk powder (SMP) and reconstituted sweet whey powder (SWP) according to the invention was performed using a combination of unit operations, to prepare three types of infant nutrition base products. Reconstituted SMP and reconstituted SWP were each subjected to UF (step 1), the retentates (UFRs) were subjected to NF (step 2) and the permeates (UFPs) to poly- and monovalent ion removal (step 3). Subsequently, the NF retentates (NFRs) from step 2 and the softened UFPs from step 3 are combined in step 4. The compositions of SMP and SWP are given in table 8. Each step of the process operated in steady state conditions for 4 - 10 h, during which an acceptable average flux was achieved throughout the entire production sequence. Concentration factors for the membrane filtration steps are given in “mass concentration factor” (MCF), which are calculated in the same way as a VCF, but using weight instead of volume. It can be assumed that MCF = VCF, since all densities are close to that of water (1000 kg/m3) and all solids present in the incoming stream end up in the retentate and permeate streams. Over time, slight variations were observed for the MCFs. Here below, the MCF range is given or the deviation from the given value was less than 10 % at all times.

The reconstituted skim milk feed material (-2800 kg) at a total solids content of 8.64 % w/w solid, pH of 6.9 at 5.8 °C, was fractionated using a mass concentration factor of 2, while the reconstituted sweet whey feed material (-3500 kg) at a total solids content of 6.1 % w/w solid, pH of 6.63 at 6.8 °C was fractionated using a mass concentration factor of 5.5 The macronutritional and mineral distribution of the liquid retentate and permeate streams from UF1 and UF2 are presented in table 9. The permeates were collected with an average flux of 10.54 kg/m2/h (for SM) and 20.21 kg/m2/h (for SW).

For concentration and demineralisation of - 500 kg of UFR1 (pH 6.82 at 6 °C) to 26 % w/w solids content, NF1 used two NF membranes in series; while for concentration and demineralisation of - 640 kg UFR2 (pH 5.88 at 6.5 °C) to 28 % w/w solids content a single NF membrane was used in NF2. NF1 operated within a mass concentration factor range of 1.8 - 2.2 while NF2 operated within a mass concentration factor range of 2.6-3. Both NF1 and NF2 were operated within the temperature range of 13-14 °C. The permeates were collected with an average flux of 1.64 kg/m2/h (for UFR1) and 9.64 kg/m2/h (for UFR2). The macronutritional and mineral distribution of the liquid retentate and permeate streams from NTT and NF2 are presented in table 10. The process yielded for NFR1 and NFR2 milk protein concentrate (MPC50) and whey protein concentrate (WPC35) powders respectively.

For concentration and demineralisation -1000 kg of UFP1 (pH 5.9 at 6.9 °C) was concentrated to 22 % w/w solids content. For concentration and demineralisation -1000 kg of UFP2 (pH 5.6 at 6 °C) was concentrated to 22 % w/w solids content. For concentration of both UFP1 and UFP2, NF3 operated within a mass concentration factor range of 3.5 - 4 at a temperature of 10 °C. Average permeate fluxes amounted to 9.73 kg/m2/h (for UFP1) and 10.9 kg/m2/h (for UFP2). The macronutritional and mineral distribution of the liquid retentate and permeate streams from NF3 are presented in table 11. Post concentration and demineralisation of UFP1 and UFP2 by NF3, both retentates were subsequently indirectly heated to 82 °C using an indirect plate heat exchanger feeding a 250 L jacketed stainless steel vessel. Once the retentate from NF3 was in the storage vessel the pH was adjusted to 7.2 (at 82 °C) using a 30 % w/w NaOH solution, causing the precipitation of calcium salts primarily of phosphate and citrate. The precipitated solution was held at 82 °C for 20 minutes to maximise the precipitation reaction followed by cooling to 20 °C using an indirect plate heat exchanger feeding a second 250 L jacketed stainless steel vessel. The precipitated material was removed from the NF3 retentate stream (post precipitation) by UF3 using two 3838 10 kDa ultrafiltration membranes in series (Synder Filtration). UF3 operated within a mass concentration factor of 10 at a temperature of 20 °C. The macronutritional and mineral distribution of the liquid retentate streams from UF3 are presented in table 12. The process according to the invention yielded ~50 % demineralisation in the UF3 retentates compared to UFP1 and UFP2 on a dry matter basis. The liquid retentate streams from UF3 were combined in a stainless steel vessel at 40 °C. The compounded batch (65 kg total mass) constituted the UFR3 from skim milk and the UFR3 from sweet whey in a mass ratio of 20:80 respectively. The batch was subsequently demineralised using a pilot electrodialysis plant (PI EDR-Y, MemBrain). The endpoint of the demineralisation was determined based on the relationship between conductivity of the demineralised lactose and the ash content therein (endpoint: conductivity < 1 mS; ash content < 0.75 wt% based on dry matter). Once the endpoint of the demineralisation was reached, the demineralised lactose concentrate stream was cooled to 5 °C followed by determination of total solids content of the ED product as 16.62 % w/w.

As such the lactose concentrate solution produced in step 3 (ED product) was used as the liquid stream to which the NFR1 and NFR2 were added, giving the desired (legally required) content and ratio of protein (casein/whey) and lactose for first-stage infant milk (IF), follow on milk (FO) and growing up milk (GUM). The streams were blended in the ratios mentioned in table 13. At this stage the liquid concentrate stream comprising demineralised lactose (from ED product), MPC (from NFR1) and WPC (from NFR2) was pre-heated to 50 °C followed by dosing of oil and GOS to meet the nutritional requirements. The liquid concentrate infant formula streams were then heated treated at 85 °C for 5 min in an indirect tubular heat exchanger (Mircothermics), homogenised downstream from the heat treatment at first and second stage pressures of 125 and 25 bar respectively (at 60 °C), followed by evaporation to 55 % w/w solids content in a single effect falling film evaporator, operating at 55 °C; and spray drying using a single stage spray dryer equipped with 2 fluid nozzle atomisation operating at an inlet and outlet temperature of 175 °C and 90 °C respectively. The nutritional composition of the IF, FO and GUM powders produced is outlined in Table 14. Note that all components mentioned in table 14, except for the fat and part of the carbohydrates (GOS) originate from the skim milk and sweet whey starting materials. All components in table 14 are either within the acceptable ranges for that component, or are below those acceptable ranges. For those components who’s content is below acceptable, fortification would be required to increase their content to within acceptable ranges. It is important to note that none of the mentioned components, not even the polyvalent ions, are present above their acceptable range, which would be unacceptable as taking out is impossible, while adding one or a few components may happen straightforward. The possibility of preparing different infant nutritional products, all according to legal standards, demonstrates the versatility and flexibility of the process according to the invention.
