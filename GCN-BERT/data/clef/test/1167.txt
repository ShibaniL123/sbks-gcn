Step 3: 7-bromo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro(2,2,3,3-d4)-1,4-benzoxazepin-5-one
To a suspension of sodium hydride (350 mg, 1.30 equiv) in DMA (20 mL) was slowly added a solution of 5-bromo-2-[2-bromo(d4)ethoxy]benzamide [Example 5, Step 2] (2.2 g, 6.73 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in DMA (5 mL). The resulting solution was stirred for 3 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of D2O (5 mL). The resulting solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (3Ã—50 mL). The organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product was purified by SiO2 chromatography eluted with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (3:2) to afford 400 mg (24%) of 7-bromo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro(2,2,3,3-d4)-1,4-benzoxazepin-5-one as a yellow solid.
