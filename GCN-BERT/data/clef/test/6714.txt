Example 3A
2-tert-Butyl 4-ethyl 5-[(ethylcarbamoyl)amino]-3-methylthiophene-2,4-dicarboxylate
6.0 g (21.0 mmol) of 2-tert-butyl 4-ethyl 5-amino-3-methylthiophene-2,4-dicarboxylate (Example 1A) were dissolved in 300 ml of dichloromethane and 6.82 g (42.1 mmol) of CDI and 11.7 ml (84.1 mmol) of triethylamine were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 2 days, after which 42 ml (84.1 mmol) of a 2 M solution of ethylamine in THF were added. After stirring at RT for a further 2 h, the mixture was evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. The remaining residue was purified by MPLC (Biotage cartridge with 340 g of silica gel, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 10:1-5:1). After evaporation of the product fractions and drying of the residue under high vacuum, 6.98 g (93% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
