5-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-N-(1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)-4-methoxypyridin-2-amine
DMF (1 mL) and DIPEA (0.022 ml, 0.13 mmol) were added sequentially to a flask charged with N-(azetidin-3-yl)-5-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-4-methoxypyridin-2-amine (22 mg, 0.050 mmol). 1-Fluoro-3-iodopropane (9 mg, 0.05 mmol) in DMF (0.1 mL) was then added. After 2 hours, the reaction was diluted with saturated aqueous sodium chloride, and the mixture was extracted in EtOAC (3Ã—). The combined organic layers were washed with water and dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude film was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 2 to 10% MeOH in DCM, to give 5-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-N-(1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)-4-methoxypyridin-2-amine (9.0 mg, 36%) as a dry film.
