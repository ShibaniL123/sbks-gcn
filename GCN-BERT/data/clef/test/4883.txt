The present application claims the priority of Chinese patent application No. 201210572660.8, filed on 26 Dec. 2012, to the Patent Office of the People's Republic of China, and titled “Freeze-dried excipient and preparation method thereof”, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the formula of a freeze-dried forming preparation and the preparation method thereof, and particularly to the formula of the freeze-dried forming preparation containing only a binder and an active ingredient but no matrix forming agent (such as amino acids, sugars, sugar alcohols and inorganic salts etc.) and the preparation method thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The technique for shaping by freeze-drying refers to a shaping technique comprising: injecting a flowable liquid, semisolid or solid containing an active ingredient into which a matrix forming agent and a binder are added, or a flowable liquid, semisolid or solid containing a binder and a matrix forming agent in itself into a mould and then shaping by freeze-drying. The formulation prepared by the shaping technique by freeze-drying is referred as a freeze-dried forming preparation. Since this type of formulation is prepared using a freeze-drying process, the degradation of the thermosensitive ingredient can be avoided. Besides, the formulation may have a fast disintegration and dissolution rate due to a great amount of micropores and channels produced by water sublimation, so that it is suitable for application in a plurality of fields, such as oral disintegrating tablets, immediate release tablets, chewable tablets and special cosmetics. Conventional freeze-dried forming preparation is composed of two parts, a matrix and an active ingredient, in which the matrix comprises a matrix forming agent and a binder. The matrix forming agent is mostly selected from the group comprising sugars, sugar alcohols, amino acids having 2 to 12 carbon atoms and inorganic salts (such as sodium phosphate, and aluminum silicate etc.) and so on (See Chinese patent CN200580013010.8). When sugars, sugar alcohols, or inorganic salts (such as sodium phosphate, and aluminum silicate etc.) are used as the matrix forming agent, collapse or complete collapse of the skeleton structure ingredient may occur, since the moisture in the air can be easily absorbed by the sugars, sugar alcohols, or inorganic salts (such as sodium phosphate, and aluminum silicate etc.) during manufacture. In addition, bad feelings due to heavy hygroscopicity, such as sticky to hand, may also happen when the package is opened by the user. Besides, it also has many disadvantages, such as prolonged disintegration etc. Although the hygroscopicity can be reduced when amino acids are used as the matrix forming agent, it can not be solved fundamentally. In addition, the cost of the production process is still a problem. Accordingly, there is still a demand for a freeze-dried forming preparation without a matrix forming agent. However, due to the technical limitation and traditional concept, there is no report on the freeze-dried forming preparation prepared using an active ingredient and a binder only. Specific description for this respect can be found in patent 200580013010 and patent 200410038822. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The technical problem intended to be solved in the present invention is to provide a simplified formulation containing only a binder and an active ingredient, but no matrix forming agent in the system. The matrix forming agent includes, but not limited to, sugars (such as maltose, and trehalose etc.), sugar alcohols (such as mannitol, and sorbitol), amino acids having 2 to 12 carbon atoms (such as glycine, alanine, and glutamic acid etc.), inorganic salts (such as sodium phosphate, and aluminium silicate etc.) and so on. After a great amount of experiments, the inventors have found that a qualified freeze-dried forming preparation can be obtained using a binder and an active ingredient only, but no matrix forming agent system by controlling the ratio between the binder and the active ingredient. On this basis, other adjuvants, such as antioxidant, flavoring agent and essence, transdermal absorption enhancer, and pH adjusting agent etc, can be added. By avoiding the use of a matrix forming agent, favorable effects, such as reduced risk for moisture absorption, simplified process, reduced cost, and enhanced unit drug loading, can be achieved. The present invention will be described in detail below. The freeze-dried forming preparation provided in the present invention comprises only two parts: a binder and an active ingredient, wherein the ratio by weight between the binder and the active ingredient is in the range from 1:100 to 100:1. It has been demonstrated by the experiments that qualified freeze-dried forming preparation can not be prepared beyond this range. The ratio by weight between the binder and the active ingredient can be further preferably in the range from 1:90 to 90:1, 1:80 to 80:1, 1:70 to 70:1, 1:60 to 60:1, 1:50 to 50:1, 1:40 to 40:1, and 1:30 to 30:1, and more preferably, 1:20 to 20:1, 1:10 to 10:1, 1:9 to 9:1, 1:8 to 8:1, and 1:7 to 7:1, and most preferably, 1:6 to 6:1, and 1:5 to 5:1. The freeze-dried forming preparation provided in the present invention can further comprise other adjuvants, for example, antioxidant, flavoring agent and essence, transdermal absorption enhancer, and pH adjusting agent etc. The other adjuvants can be present in the amount of 0.1-5%, and preferably, 0.1-3%, based on the total content of the obtained freeze-dried forming preparation. The active ingredient can be water-soluble or water-insoluble. The active ingredient can be selected from the combination of one or more of chemical medicine ingredients, traditional Chinese medicine ingredients, natural extracts, bioactive ingredients and beneficial ingredients for skin care.
