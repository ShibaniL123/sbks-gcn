115.12: N-[(S)-2-(5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-propyl]acetamide (compound 115)
0.1 ml (0.8 mmol) of triethylamine and 68 mg (0.7 mmol) of acetic anhydride are added at −10° C. to a solution containing 391 mg (0.6 mmol) of 3-((S)-2-amino-1-methylethyl)-5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-1-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione in 3.2 ml of tetrahydrofuran. The mixture is hydrolysed after 5 minutes at −10° C. with water and diluted with ethyl acetate. The aqueous phase is extracted three times with ethyl acetate, the organic phase is washed with 1N soda and then with brine. After drying over magnesium sulphate, the solution is filtered and then concentrated. The precipitate is taken up in ethyl acetate and stirred for 24 hours at room temperature. 190 mg (44%) of N-[(S)-2-(5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-propyl]acetamide is obtained in the form of a white solid with a melting point of 200° C.
