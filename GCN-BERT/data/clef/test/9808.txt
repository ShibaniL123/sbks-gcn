BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS For a further understanding of the nature, objects, and advantages of the present invention, reference should be had to the following detailed description, read in conjunction with the following drawings, wherein like reference numerals denote like elements and wherein: FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention; FIG. 2 is a side view of the preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention; FIG. 3 is a sectional view taken along lines 3-3 of FIG. 1; FIG. 4 is a side sectional view of the preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention; FIG. 5 is a fragmentary perspective view of the preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention; FIG. 6 is a partial cutaway perspective view of the preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention illustrating an alternate support for the cabinet in the form of a burner; FIG. 7 is a partial cutaway perspective view of the preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention illustrating an alternate support for the cabinet in the form of a burner; FIG. 8 is a perspective view of another embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention; and FIG. 9 is a perspective exploded view of another embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIGS. 1-5 show the preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention designated generally by the numeral 10. Smoker apparatus 10 provides an elongated vertically extended cabinet 11 having an open front 12 that allows a user to obtain access to a plurality of vertically spaced apart shelves 21 that are contained within cabinet 11. The open front 12 can be closed during use with front door 13 which has a closure latch 30. The cabinet 11 has a bottom panel 16, a top panel 17, side panels 18, 19, rear panel 20 and a plurality of legs 15. A vent pipe 14 can be attached to the upper end portion of cabinet 11, such as to top panel 17. An air intake valve 49 can be mounted to the lower end portion of cabinet 11 (see FIG. 1). In an alternate embodiment (FIGS. 6-7), the legs 15 are replaced with a burner frame 31 that has its own base 32 and legs 33. In the alternate embodiment, the cabinet 11 does not have legs 15 but rests upon the burner frame 31 which also supplies heat via its burner element 37 as will be described more fully hereinafter. At the lower end portion of cabinet 11 there is provided a specially configured slide bracket 29 that supports a pair of containers or pans including an upper water container or pan 22 and a lower wood chips container or pan 23. The wood chips pan 23 is preferably provided with a perforated lid 24 having perforations 46 that are sized and shaped to enable smoke to be emitted from the burning chips of wood that are placed in pan 23 and ignited with a flame so that during use the chips of wood smoulder and generate smoke as is desirable. The bottom panel 16 provides an opening 28. A burner element 25 is positioned immediately below opening 28 so that heat generated by burner element 25 rises upwardly via opening 28 to the bottom of wood chips pan 23. Heat further rises upwardly and heats the water contained in water pan 22 and the food to be smoked. The burner element 25 can be supplied with a gaseous fuel product such as butane or propane via a fuel supply hose 26 and known regulator that can be attached to a commercially available butane or propane containing cannister. Control knob 39 and valve 27 enables the flow of fuel to burner 25 to be opened or closed, enabling the heat generated by burner element 25 to be controlled. In the preferred embodiment, there is a side door 40 attached to side panel 19 that is preferably much smaller than the front door 13. Door 40 can be a part of side panel 18 or 19 (see FIG. 2). The smaller door 40 is of a size that when opened, allows a user to slide either pan 22 or 23 laterally through the opening 45 in side wall 18 or 19 that is exposed when the side door 40 is opened (see arrows 47, 48 in FIG. 5). Each of the pans 22, 23 is supported by a rail or slide part of the bracket 29. The slide bracket 29 features a plurality of vertically extended specially shaped bars 44 that extend between a lower rail or slide 43 and an upper rail or slide 41. The upper pan 22, preferably a water pan, has a pan shoulder or flange 42 that engages rail 41 so that the pan 22 slides upon rail 41 at the flange 42. The lower rail 43 is positioned inwardly of the upper rail 41 as shown. This enables the lower rail 43 to support the underside of wood chips pan 23 as shown. As an optional under carriage, burner frame 31 can be substituted in place of legs 15 (see FIGS. 6-7). In that regard, the burner frame 31 has a rectangular or square base 32 comprised of a plurality of connected lower beams, legs 33 that extend upwardly from base 32 and corners 34 that are defined by the legs 33 and upper beams 38. A wind guard 35 is supported by a plurality of grates 36. A burner element 37 is contained within wind guard 35. The upper beams 38 can be vertically extended or ell shaped in cross section so that when the cabinet 11 is placed upon burner frame 31, the upper beams 38 restrict lateral movement of the cabinet 11. Thus the upper beams 38 can be vertically extended flat bars, for example or ell shaped angle bars having vertical 51 and horizontal 50 sections. If angle bars are used for upper beams 38, the cabinet 11 can rest upon the horizontal section of the angle bar, wherein the bottom panel 16 of the cabinet 11 engages the horizontal portion 50 of the upper beam 38. FIGS. 8 and 9 show an additional embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention, designated generally by the numeral 10A. Smoker apparatus 10A in FIGS. 8 and 9 provides a cart 66 that has two burners. One burner can be a burner frame 31 with burner element 37 as with the embodiment of FIGS. 6 and 7. As with the embodiment of FIGS. 6 and 7, the cabinet 11 nests upon the burner frame 31. FIG. 8 shows the cabinet 11 resting upon burner frame 31. FIG. 9 shows the cabinet 11 lifted vertically from frame 31 as indicated by arrow 64. In the embodiment of FIGS. 8 and 9, the frame 31 is part of a cart 66. The cart 66 provides a pair of feet 52 and a pair of wheels 53. The frame 31 is attached to a pair of legs 57 that extend upwardly from bottom shelf 58. Frame 31 can be attached to legs 57 using welding for example. At a position next to the lower end of frame 31, the cart 66 provides bottom shelf 58. At a position near the top of burner frame 31, cart 66 provides middle shelf 59. Above the shelves 58, 59 is provided an upper burner 65 that includes a burner element 60 surrounded by wind guard 61, the wind guard being supported by grate members 62. In the embodiment of FIGS. 8 and 9, there can be four grate members 62, each one extending along a radial line from a leg 54 or 57 toward the center of burner element 60. Thus, the cart 66 provides an upper burner 65 that includes the same basic burner elements as the burner frame 31 of FIGS. 6-7 and 8-9. The cart 66 has legs 54 that extend upwardly from feet 52 and that connect with burner top 63 and handles 55 as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9. The arrangement of FIGS. 8 and 9 enables a cook to prepare certain food items for smoking within cabinet 11 and other food items to be cooked upon upper burner 65 when placed upon burner top 63. Burner top 63 can be open so that a pot or other item to be used for cooking can be placed directly upon grate members 62. Alternatively, burner top 63 can be covered with a mesh or like covering that enables items to be warmed or slow cooked. The following is a list of parts and materials suitable for use in the present invention.
