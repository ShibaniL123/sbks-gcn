(9)Preparation of 5-chloro-N4-(2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)-N2-(6-methyl-5-(1,2,3,6-tetrahy dropyridine-4-yl)chroman-8-yl)pyrimidine-2,4-diamine
Tert-butyl 4-(8-amino-6-methylchroman-5-yl)-3,6-dihydropyridine-1(2H)-carboxylate (78mg, 0.23 mmol), 2,5-dichloro-N-(2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)pyrimidin-4-amine (78 mg, 0.23 mmol), and p-toluene sulfonic acid (39 mg, 0.23 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL tertiary amyl alcohol. After reacting at 120Â°C for 12 h, the resultant mixture was cooled to room temperature, and 20mL ethyl acetate was added. The resultant mixture was washed with10 mL saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and the organic phase was dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. After column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate=1:1), the final product(70 mg, yield: 56%) was obtained.
