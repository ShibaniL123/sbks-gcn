TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a prophylactic or therapeutic drug for hepatic fibrosis. More particularly, the present invention relates to a prophylactic or therapeutic drug for hepatic fibrosis containing a CBP/β-catenin inhibitor. BACKGROUND ART Hepatic fibrosis is a condition in which production of fiber tissues called extracellular matrix composed of collagen and glycoconjugates is promoted in the process of repairing hepatocytes necrotized by various hepatic disorders such as viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatopathy, autoimmune hepatopathy, metabolic hepatopathy and the like, and these fiber tissues are gradually accumulated along with the progression of the disease. Particularly, after infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), persistent infection occurs easily and chronic hepatitis is developed. Chronic hepatitis progresses to hepatic fibrosis, in which production of matrix exceeds decomposition and absorption thereof, and accumulation of fiber tissues continues, and gradually progresses to cirrhosis in which liver becomes hard due to fiber tissues. Cirrhosis is a terminal stage symptom of chronic hepatitis, and highly frequently develops hepatocyte cancer. There is no radical cure except for liver transplantation, and development of a treatment method inducing defibrosis in the stage of hepatic fibrosis before developing cirrhosis is urgently needed. Patent documents 1, 2 and the like disclose liver fibrosis inhibitors containing a hydroquinone derivative, proanthocyanidin and the like as an active ingredient. These known documents disclose only studies for a suppressive action on liver fibrosis at a cellular level and for an acute cirrhosis model induced by chemical substances such as carbon tetrachloride and the like, and verification using a model showing slow and sustained progression from chronic hepatitis to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, which is caused by hepatitis virus, has not been performed. DOCUMENT LIST Patent Documents patent document 1: JP-A-2009-256226 patent document 2: JP-A-2009-242374 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention The present invention aims to provide a prophylactic or therapeutic drug for hepatic fibrosis having a superior prophylactic or therapeutic effect, particularly a prophylactic or therapeutic drug for hepatic fibrosis caused by hepatitis virus. Means of Solving the Problems In view of the above-mentioned problem, the present inventors have conducted intensive studies of the establishment of an appropriate animal model of hepatic fibrosis caused by hepatitis virus. As a result, they have succeeded in establishing a viral chronic hepatitis model mouse that expresses a hepatitis virus protein at an optional time, and develops chronic hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis and then cirrhosis.

Hepatic fibrosis to be the target in the prophylaxis or treatment of the present invention is preferably one caused by viral hepatitis. The pathogenic virus of viral hepatitis is not particularly limited, and hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis E virus and the like can be mentioned. Of these, an embodiment wherein hepatic fibrosis is developed via hepatitis C caused by hepatitis C virus is preferable. The “treatment of hepatic fibrosis” means complete cure of the pathology of hepatic fibrosis, as well as suppression of the progression or exacerbation of the symptoms to prevent progression of the pathology, even though it may not be a complete cure, or improvement of a part of or whole pathology to lead to the direction of cure.

(CBP/β-Catenin Inhibitor) β-catenin acts as a mediator of Wnt signal transduction, binds to a transcription factor Tcf/Lef (T cell factor/Lymphocyte enhancing factor), promotes expression of various genes (cyclin D1, c-Myc etc.) relating to Wnt signal transduction, and controls growth and differentiation of the cells (He et al., 1998 Science 281 1509-1512: Kolligs et al., 1999 Mol. Cell. Biol. 19, 5696-5706: Crawford et al., 1999, Oncogene 18, 2883-2891: Shtutman et al., 1999, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 11, 5522-5527: Tetsu and McCormick, 1999 Nature, 398, 422-426). CBP (cyclic AMP reactive element binding protein (CREB) binding protein) directly interacts with β-catenin in the CREB binding domain, and promotes transcription activation of Tcf/Lef (Ken-Ichi Takemaru and Randall T. Moon, 2000 J. Cell. Biol., 149, 2, 249-254). The CBP/β-catenin inhibitor is not particularly limited as long as it inhibits interaction of CBP and β-catenin, and an embodiment wherein it inhibits binding of β-catenin and CBP and, as a result, suppresses gene expression by β-catenin complex is preferable. While CBP/β-catenin inhibition can be measured by a binding assay known per se (radiobinding assay etc.), reporter assay method and the like, it can be preferably confirmed by measuring the gene expression of Wnt signal transduction by the reporter assay method described in WO 2009/148192.

(Hepatic Fibrosis Model Mouse) The present inventors produced, as an animal model capable of accurately evaluating chronic hepatitis C in human, a transgenic mouse (Cre/loxP/HCV-MxCreTg mouse) capable of switching expression of HCV gene at an optional time by mating a transgenic (Cre/loxP/HCV-Tg) mouse introduced with an HCV gene by the Cre/loxP system, and a transgenic (Mx-Cre-Tg) mouse capable of expressing IFN-inducible Cre. When polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)) is administered to this Tg mouse, IFNα-inducible Cre enzyme is expressed, which loops out a neomycin resistance gene sandwiched between loxP sequences, whereby HCV protein can be expressed at an optional time. That is, since the switching expression system was established, expression of HCV gene no longer occurred in the developmental stage, and an immune reaction state similar to HCV infection was successfully produced. The HCV protein in the liver, which was expressed by the administration of Poly(I:C) to the model mouse was not completely eliminated and sustained expression for 600 days or longer was confirmed. Morphologically, hepatocyte swelling, fat denaturation, glycogene denaturation, turbulence of hepatocyte cord, fibrosis, hepatocyte cancer and lymphoma and the like were observed. Therefore, the Cre/loxP/HCV-MxCre Tg mouse is a pathology model capable of accurately evaluating the pathology from hepatitis C to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and to liver cancer. (Pharmaceutical Preparation Containing CBP/β-Catenin Inhibitor) The CBP/β-catenin inhibitor of the present invention can be administered to human or animal (e.g., mammals such as mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, cat, dog, bovine, sheep, monkey and the like) as a pharmaceutical preparation (e.g., injection, capsule, tablet, powder, granule and the like) formulated by a conventional method. For example, it is preferably administered at a dose in the amount of the active ingredient of about 0.01-1000 mg/kg (body weight) per day, preferably about 0.1-500 mg/kg (body weight) per day, in one to several portions. The dose thereof, administration method and administration frequency may vary as appropriate depending on the symptom, age and the like. For example, for formulation into injection, carriers such as distilled water, saline and the like may be used and, for formulation into capsule, tablet, powder, granule, excipients such as starch, lactose, sucrose, calcium carbonate and the like, binders such as starch paste, gum arabic, gelatin, sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose and the like, lubricants such as magnesium stearate, talc and the like, disintegrants such as starch, agar, crystalline cellulose, calcium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium alginate and the like, and the like can be used. The content of the active ingredient in a preparation can vary between 1-99 wt %. For example, the dosage form of tablet, capsule, granule, powder and the like preferably contain 5-80 wt % of the active ingredient, and injection preferably contains 1-10 wt % of the active ingredient. While the administration method is not particularly limited, oral administration, intravenous administration, intravenous sustained administration, intraperitoneal administration and the like can be mentioned. Also, an embodiment wherein an osmotic pressure pump filled with the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is, for example, subcutaneously embedded for administration in a sustained manner is preferable. EXAMPLES The present invention is explained in more detail in the following by referring to Examples, which are not to be construed as limitative in any way. Example 1 Production of Hepatic Fibrosis Model Mouse R6CN2 HCV cDNA (nt 294-3435) and whole genome HCV cDNA (nt 1-9611) were cloned from blood samples collected from patients (#R6) affected with chronic active hepatitis. The infection of the blood samples was measured according to the method reported in a known document (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 6037-6041). R6CN2HCV and R6CN5HCV transgenic mice were crossed with Mx1-Cre transgenic mouse (purchased from Jackson Laboratory) to produce R6CN2HCV-MxCre transgenic mouse and R6CN5HCV-MxCre transgenic mouse, which were named CN2-29(+/−)/MxCre(+/−) mouse and RzCN5-15(+/−)/MxCre(+/−) mouse, respectively. The expression of Cre in the liver of these mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [Poly(I:C)] (purchased from GE Healthcare UK Ltd. (Buckinghamshire, England)). That is, 300 μL of poly(I:C) solution (1 mg/mL phosphate buffered saline [PBS]) was intraperitoneally injected, after lapse of 2 months from birth, 3 times at 48 hr intervals. HCV gene expression can be induced in almost all hepatocytes by performing this poly(I:C) administration operation once. The expression persists for not less than 600 days, and a hepatic fibrosis animal model that shows from chronic hepatitis to liver fibrosis could be established. The all animal care and experiment procedures were performed according to the guideline established by Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science Subcommittee on Laboratory Animal Care. Example 2 Treatment Effect of CBP/β-Catenin Inhibitor A CBP/β-catenin inhibitor was intraperitoneally administered to the CN2-29(+/−)/MxCre(+/−) mouse obtained in Example 1, and whether the CBP/β-catenin inhibitor has a treatment effect on hepatic fibrosis was examined by histological staining of the hepatic tissues collected from the model mouse. (1) Preparation and Administration of CBP/β-Catenin Inhibitor A CBP/β-catenin inhibitor was dissolved in commercially available PBS (pH 7.6), and the pH was adjusted again to 7.6 with an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution to give a 40 mg/ml CBP/β-catenin inhibitor solution. This solution (250 μl) was filled in an osmotic pressure pump (ALZET mini-osmotic pump model 2006) and embedded subcutaneously in the back of mouse, whereby a CBP/β-catenin inhibitor was administered at 0.15 μl/hr for 42 days in a sustained manner. For the control group, commercially available PBS (pH7.6) was similarly filled in an osmotic pressure pump and administered as a vehicle by embedding same subcutaneously in the back of mouse. The schedule of production of a model and administration of a CBP/β-catenin inhibitor is shown in FIG. 1. The CBP/β-catenin inhibitor used in this Example was as described below: 4-(((6S,9S)-1-(benzylcarbamoyl)-2,9-dimethyl-4,7-dioxo-8-(quinolin-8-ylmethyl)octahydro-1H-pyrazino[2,1-c][1,2,4]triazin-6-yl)methyl)phenyl dihydrogen phosphate (hereinafter to be simply referred to as “CBP/β-catenin inhibitory compound”). The CBP/β-catenin inhibitory compound is the compound described in Example 1-7 of WO 2009/148192, and can be synthesized by the method described in the document. A CBP/β-catenin inhibitory action of the CBP/β-catenin inhibitory compound has been confirmed by the reporter assay method described in the document. (2) Histological Staining Autopsy was performed on day 42 from the administration of the CBP/β-catenin inhibitory compound of (1), the liver was removed and histologically searched. As for staining, the whole image of the tissue was stained and observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE staining), and fiber was stained and observed by silver staining and Azan staining. Hematoxylin-eosin staining is the most basic and important general staining method for pathological tissues, and aims to grasp the whole image of a tissue structure at a light microscopic level. Using each staining solution of hematoxylin and eosin, dyeing in different colors is performed as follows. livid to light blue by hematoxylin: cell nuclei, calcareous parts, cartilaginous tissue, bacteria, mucosa. red to dark red by eosin: cytoplasm, interstitial tissues, various fibers, erythrocytes, keratinocytes. Silver staining aims to stain reticular fiber which is one of the binding tissue fibers. Azan staining is a staining method to dye in different colors for collagenous fibers (dark blue) and muscle fibers (blue). Specific method is as described below. A tissue sample was fixed with 4% para-formaldehyde in PBS, embedded in paraffin and sliced (thickness 4 μm). The obtained section was subjected to hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE), silver staining and Azan staining. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed according to the method described in a handbook of histopathological staining (Kiyoyuki Takahashi, Igaku-Shoin). Silver staining was performed according to the method described in a handbook of histopathological staining (Kiyoyuki Takahashi, Igaku-Shoin). Azan staining was performed according to the method described in a handbook of histopathological staining (Kiyoyuki Takahashi, Igaku-Shoin). The results are shown in FIG. 2 (HE staining), FIG. 3 (silver staining) and FIG. 4 (Azan staining). The CBP/β-catenin inhibitory compound improved hepatic lobule structure of chronic hepatitis C model mouse (Cre/loxP/HCV-MxCre Tg mouse) by administration for 42 days, thus showing a defibrosing action (FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4). Liver tissue abnormally grown due to chronic hepatitis and having no hepatocyte cord structure was normalized to take a cord-like form by the administration of a CBP/β-catenin inhibitory compound (FIG. 2). Due to chronic hepatitis, liver fibrosis was promoted and reticular fiber was strongly stained by silver impregnation (FIG. 3, left). Staining of reticular fiber was weakened and normalized by the administration of a CBP/β-catenin inhibitory compound (FIG. 3, right). Similarly, promoted liver fibrosis due to chronic hepatitis and strong staining of collagenous fibers by Azan staining were normalized by the administration of a CBP/β-catenin inhibitory compound and the staining was weakened (FIG. 4). From the above results, it was clarified that a CBP/β-catenin inhibitor has a defibrosing action on chronic hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis.
