The present invention relates rain water harvesting from Railway Platforms shades and other places. More particularly it related to the a system and method of rain water harvesting from Railway Platform shades and other similar places having long and wide roofs. Background of invention The water received by railway platform shades could be either directly taken in to tank in line with the platform which could act a s a reservoir which will supply water to the railway station, railway quarters and people staying in the vicinity of the railway stations. Excess water can always be drained to nearby wells or bore wells. Same principle could be applied to all bus stations, offices, godowns, schools colleges; institutes wherein the topmost floor or surface exposed to atmosphere have very large surfaces which receive rain water.. Water from overhead tanks could be a source of supply to railway station taps, loft tanks railway quarters population adjacent to railway stations farms. Bottling plant could be installed near railway stations to prepare mineral water which could be either supplied to local city population or transported by railways to various cities all over the country. Water also could be distributed by railway tankers wherever they are needed in the country. The novel concept provided by the inventor of the present invention is not practiced anywhere in the word. It would solve the water problem totally all over to a great extent. Any method of rainwater harvesting wil reduce the sea level and will invrease the underground water level in a short period of time may be in 3-5 years and may probably permanently. Rain falls in balconies most of which does not reach the ground. Rain water would be collected from one balcony to another by way of either cement pipe or fiber glass, plastic pipes. The lowest balconies are connected to either a reservoir or drained to bore wells. During heavy rains a generator could be run by the heavy force of heavy rain falling from a height of 100 feet to generate electricity. The generated electricity could be of use to the society particularly when the electricity supply from service provider is off during thunder storm. This creates a small underground tank which is a great source of water throughout the year. This will reduce the necessity for large dams and lakes which are costly. This can from an underground lake for the city. Rain water harvesting is one of the important methods to overcome the problem of scarcity of water. However it is observed that this important means has been totally neglected and its potential is not property exploited. The local authorities have now decided to give its due importance to the rain water harvesting and have now started linking the sanctions to the provisions of rain water harvesting systems or giving tax incentives. It is observed that most of the housing complexes do not have provisions for rain water harvesting. Rain water falling on the large sheds of the railway platforms having very large rain collection area and terraces on high buildings is often seen flowing to drains. The great potential of harvesting this water needs to be recognized and used for supply of water. This will reduce the burden on common sources of water at least in the rainy season. The object of the present invention is to provide a system for rain water harvesting using these large railways platform shades, and large terraces of tall buildings. Still another object is to provide a method of rain water harvesting for collecting the rain water which otherwise goes to drains and using it at times in the year when the water supply is scanty. Still another object is to increase the underground water level. Yet another object is to provide a process that saves rain water which otherwise would have gone waste so that the use of water from common sources like dams, rivers are avoided and the saved water could be used in the scarcity months like April to June. Brief Description of the Drawings: FIG. 1 shows the schematic representation of the rain water harvesting system using railway sheds. Fig. 2 shows the schematic representation of the rain water harvesting system using high building with large terrace areas. Detailed description of the drawings: Referring to figure 1 the system of the present invention comprises connecting the slanting edges of the large sheds of the railway platforms exemplified by platform (1), (2), (3) with colleting means exemplified by pipes, interconnecting the collecting means of each of the individual platforms to form a network converging in to overhead tanks, the said overhead tanks connected to storages supplying the water to users. Referring to fig. (2) the system for rain water harvesting from high buildings having large terraces exposed to the sky comprises, connecting the large terrace (4) areas, the balconies of all the flats on all the stories exemplified by (1), (2), (3) to a network of pipes so converge the said network to as to a fan (6) for forcing the said rain water collected to bore wells (5) or to generators (7) for producing electricity. Working of the invention The rain water falling on the tanks which are closed at the top are modified as shown in the present inventions wherein the top lateral walls of the tank (1) are extended or manufactured to have a funnel shaped structure to increase the area through which the water is collected in the tank, the increased area collects more water allowing the same to be collected in the tank. This extra water otherwise goes to drains. By increasing the area of collecting rain water about 40% more water is collected in the rainy season. Advantages of the present invention: 1. The present invention provides a system to use large railway platform shades or large terrace areas for enlarging the surface exposed to rains of the tanks in the housing complexes, corporation storage tanks for collecting, storing and using the harvested rain water without any use of power, electricity thus saving electricity for 3/4 months. 2. The existing water storage tanks may also be modified to increase the rain collecting area. 3. The storage extended is also provided with conventional filtering unit to obtain rain water harvesting with clean water. 4. The device and the process provided by the present invention results in saving 30-40% of water at sources likes lake, dams, wells borewells which will be available during the shortage months of April to June every year. 1.
