Polymer blend for Metal Plating Description The present invention relates to polymer blends for metal plating, in particular for electroplating, metal-plated polymer blends and their uses e. g. for automotive applications. The need for automotive exterior chromed applications with excellent surface appearance and good scratch/scuff resistance is well known. Typical exterior chrome applications (e.g. grilles/wheel covers) require no surface defects such as pits, scratches upon initial factory installation and over ten years field performance without delamination, blisters or cracks. The trend in the auto industry is to continue to use (co)polymers such as Acrylonitrile- Butadiene-Styrene (ABS) and blends made from ABS and Polycarbonate (ABS+PC) for chrome plating. WO 99/65991 discloses a thermoplastic molding composition and a molded article comprising the composition which surface is coated with an electrolessly deposited metallic material. The composition comprises 51 to 90 parts by weight (pbw) of an ar- omatic polycarbonate, up to 30 pbw of a rubber free styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer (SAN), 5 to 30 pbw of a first graft copolymer and 1 to 15 pbw of a second graft copolymer, and a wax added to said resin. US 4,847,153 discloses a metal plated molded part prepared from a thermoplastic molding composition comprising a blend of a polycarbonate (20 to 95, preferably 30 to 80 phr, in all examples 52 wt.-%), an ABS graft polymer and an elastomeric rubber. Molded discs were coated with layers of metals by electroless plating. JP-A 2010-159457 discloses a method for direct electroplating of plastics, in particular of PC/ABS-blends. The PC/ABS-plastic material contains not less than 50% of polycarbonate. JP-A 201 1 -236263 describes an ABS+PC resin composition for metal-plating and a plated resin product. The resin composition is composed of graft copolymers A1 and A2 based on diene rubbers, a SAN-copolymer and a polycarbonate resin. The content of the polycarbonate resin is between 20 and 70 mass%, preferably between 35 and 65 mass%. WO 2013/1 15903 discloses a thermoplastic polycarbonate blend composition with improved electroplate adhesion. The composition comprises 40 to 75 wt.%, preferably 45 to 55 wt.%, of a polycarbonate resin, 40 to 48 wt.% of a first impact modifier (ABS graft copolymer) and 1 to 7 wt.% of a second impact modifier (methacrylate butadiene sty- rene = MBS). Molded plaques were produced and electroplated. The properties of the finished chrome-plated parts according to the state of the art such as surface quality, impact resistance, and scratch/scuff resistance are not yet satisfying for the original equipment manufacturers or end use customers. Thus, there is a need for metal plateable plastics with improved properties as afore mentioned. Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide (co)polymer blends for metal plating, in particular electroplating, which are metal-plateable, in particular chrome- plateable, and deliver a high initial quality and a maximum long term quality. A further object of the invention is to provide metal-plated molded articles which have an improved plating grade, good adhesion and thermal cycling adherence while still maintaining superior mechanical properties. An important pre-condition is the benign processing behavior, it is important to the processor that the "temperature window" of processing is broad. A first aspect of the invention is a thermoplastic molding composition comprising (or consisting of) components A) to C): A) 20 to 55 wt.% of at least one graft rubber copolymer (A), obtained by emulsion polymerization of styrene and acrylonitrile in a weight ratio of 95:5 to 50:50, sty- rene and/or acrylonitrile being able to be partially or completely replaced by [al- pha]-methylstyrene, methyl methacrylate or N-phenylmaleimide or mixtures thereof, in the presence of at least one polymer latex (a) of a conjugated diene; B) 20 to 55 wt.% of at least one rubber free vinyl copolymer of 50 to 99 percent (B1 ) and 1 to 50 percent (B2), the percent values being relative to the weight of the copolymer, where (B1 ) is at least one member selected from the group consisting of styrene, omethyl styrene, nucleus-substituted styrene, and methyl methacry- late and where (B2) is at least one member selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, maleic anhydride, N-alkyl-substituted maleic imide and N-aryl-substituted maleic imide; C) 25 to 45 %, preferred 25 to 34% by weight of at least one aromatic polycarbonate; and wherein the sum of components A), B) and C) totals 100% by weight.

The invention also relates to the use of the thermoplastic molding composition as described above for covering surfaces, in particular for electroplating. The invention also relates to a shaped article comprising the thermoplastic molding composition as described above, where the surface preferably is coated with an elec- troplated metal. The Use of the metal-plated shaped article for automotive applications is also one aspect of the invention.

In addition, the composition of the invention may contain one or more additives D, such as plasticizers, waxes, antioxidants, plating additives, silicone oil, stabilizers, flame- retardants, fibers, mineral fibers, mineral fillers, dyes, pigments and the like. Said additives D may optionally be present in the polymer composition in low amounts such as 0.1 to 5 parts by weight, preferably 0.1 to 3 parts by weight, per 100 parts resin of the total of components A, B, and C. Furthermore the polymer composition as afore-mentioned can optionally comprise one or more other rubber-free thermoplastic polymers E, such as polyesters and polyam- ides. Said polymers E can be added in amounts of 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, per 100 parts resin of the total of components A, B, and C. According to one embodiment of the invention, it is preferred that no further thermoplastic polymer E is present. Component A The average particle size d50 of the graft rubber copolymer (A) is generally from 50 to 700 nm, preferably from 60 to 600 nm, and particularly preferably from 70 to 500 nm. The particle size distribution of the graft rubber copolymer (A) can be mono-, bi-, or poly-modal. The particle size distribution can be determined by standard methods. According to one embodiment, the particle size distribution of the graft rubber copolymer (A) is bimodal, and the first maximum of the particle size distribution lies within the range from 80 to 150 nm, and the second maximum of the particle size distribution lies within the range from 200 to 500 nm. According to a further embodiment, the particle size distribution of the graft rubber copolymer (A) is tri-modal, and the first maximum of the particle size distribution lies within the range from 80 to 150 nm, and the second and third maximum of the particle size distribution lies within the range from 200 to 500 nm. To achieve a bi-, tri- or polymodal particle size distribution of the graft polymer (A), it is possible to prepare, separately from one another in the usual manner, two or more different graft polymers A1 ), A2) etc. differing in their mean particle size, and to mix said graft polymers A1 ), A2) etc. in the desired mixing ratio. As an alternative for achieving bi-, tri- or poly-modal particle size distributions of the graft polymer (A), between the preparation of the polymer latex (a), and the grafting of the graft co-monomers on said polymer latex as graft base, an agglomeration step can be carried out by use of an agglomeration copolymer, in order to adjust the particle sizes and particle size distributions in a controlled manner. The person skilled in the art is aware of various processes for partial or complete agglomeration of the graft (B1 ), see EP-A 1 305 345, EP-A 029 613, EP-A 007 810, DE-A 12 33 131 , DE-A 12 58 076 and DE-A 21 01 650. A suitable graft rubber copolymer (A) prepared by aid of an agglomeration copolymer and the corresponding agglomeration process are disclosed in WO 2008/020012 (in particular: pages 3, line 31 to page 4, line 8 and pages 13, line 27 to page 15, line 33). The polymer latex (a) is usually produced by emulsion polymerization of a conjugated diene, preferably butadiene and/or isoprene, more preferably butadiene. In the context of this invention butadiene means 1 ,3-butadiene. Optional, but preferred is the emulsion polymerization according to the so-called seed polymerization technique, in which first of all a finely particulate polymer, preferably a butadiene, a butadiene/styrene or a styrene polymer, is produced as seed latex and is then polymerised further with diene monomers into larger particles (see for example in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Makromolekulare Stoffe, Part 1 , p. 339 (1961 ), Thieme Verlag Stuttgart). In this connection the process is preferably carried out using a seed batch process or a continuous seed flow process. As co-monomers there may be used up to 50 wt. % (referred to the total amount of monomer used for the butadiene polymer production) of one or more monomers co- polymerisable with butadiene and/or isoprene, preferably butadiene. Examples of suitable monomers include: chloroprene, acrylonitrile, styrene, [alpha]-methyl styrene, C C4-alkylstyrenes, CrC8-alkyl acrylates, CrC8-alkyl meth-acrylates, alkylene glycol di- acrylates, alkylene glycol dimethacrylates, divinyl benzene; butadiene is preferably used alone or mixed with up to 20 wt. %, preferably with up to 10 wt. %, of styrene and/or acrylonitrile. Also styrene derivatives like alpha-methylstyrene, as well as alkyl- (meth)acrylates on N-phenylmaleinimide are examples for comonomers. In gerenal, all radically copolymerizable monomers are suitable. The amount has to be carefully selected, so that the resulting rubber latex still has rubber like properties (i.e. functions as impact modifier) at room temperature, preferably also down to -40 °C. As seed latex polymers there are preferably used butadiene polymers such as poly- butadiene, butadiene/styrene copolymers, butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers, or polymers obtained from the aforementioned monomers. In principle there may also be used other finely particulate latex polymers, for example polystyrene or styrene copolymers, poly(methyl methacrylate) or methyl methacrylate copolymers, as well as polymers of other vinyl monomers. Preferred seed latex polymers are polybutadiene latices. In this context, seed latices with a mean particle diameter d50 of 10 to 220 nm, preferably 20 to 210 nm, more preferably 30 to 200 nm, even more preferably 80 to 150 nm, are used in the production of the polymer latex (a). When using seed latices with mean particle diameters d50 above 80 nm, preferably above 90 nm and particularly preferably above 100 nm, the seed latices themselves may also preferably be produced by seed polymerization. For this purpose there are preferably used seed latices with mean particle diameters d50 of 10 to 60 nm, preferably 20 to 50 nm. According to one embodiment of the invention two or more graft rubber polymers (A1 ), (A2), (A3) etc. are used as component (A), which are different in the mean particle diameter d5o of the polymer latex (a) of the conjugated diene. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the graft rubber polymer (A) is a mixture of graft rubber polymer (A1 ), graft rubber polymer (A2), and optionally graft rubber polymer (A3). The graft rubber polymer (A1 ) is obtained by emulsion polymerization of styrene and acrylonitrile in a weight ratio of 95:5 to 50:50, styrene and/or acrylonitrile being able to be partially or completely replaced by [alpha]-methylstyrene, methyl methacrylate or N- phenylmaleimide or mixtures thereof, in the presence of a polymer latex (a1 ) of butadiene having a mean particle diameter d50 of 230 to 330 nm, preferably 240 to 320 nm and particularly preferably 250 to 310 nm. The polymer latex (a1 ) has a mean particle diameter d50 of 230 to 330 nm, preferably 240 to 320 nm and particularly preferably 250 to 310 nm. The gel content of (a1 ) is 30 to 80 wt. %, preferably 40 to 75 wt. % and particularly preferably 45 to 70 wt. %. The gel content is measured by standard methods. The graft rubber polymer (A2) is obtained by emulsion polymerization of styrene and acrylonitrile in a weight ratio of 95:5 to 50:50, styrene and/or acrylonitrile being able to be partially or completely replaced by [alpha]-methylstyrene, methyl methacrylate or N- phenylmaleimide or mixtures thereof, in the presence of a polymer latex (a2) of butadiene having a mean particle diameter d50 of 340 to 480 nm, preferably 350 to 470 nm, and particularly preferably 360 to 460 nm. The polymer latex (a2) has a mean particle diameter d50 of 340 to 480 nm, preferably 350 to 470 nm, and particularly preferably 360 to 460 nm. The gel content of (a2) is 50 to 95 wt. %, preferably 55 to 90 wt. %, and particularly preferably 60 to 85 wt. %. The graft rubber polymer (A3) is obtained by emulsion polymerization of styrene and acrylonitrile in a weight ratio of 95:5 to 50:50, styrene and/or acrylonitrile being able to be partially or completely replaced by [alpha]-methylstyrene, methyl methacrylate or N- phenylmaleimide or mixtures thereof, in the presence of a polymer latex (a3) of butadiene having a mean particle diameter d50 of 10 to 220 nm, preferably 20 to 210 nm, particularly preferably 30 to 200 nm, more preferably 80 to 150 nm. The butadiene polymer latex (a3) has a mean particle diameter d50 of 10 to 220 nm, preferably 20 to 210 nm, particularly preferably 30 to 200 nm, and more preferably 80 to 150 nm. The gel content of (a3) is 30 to 98 wt. %, preferably 40 to 95 wt. %, and particularly preferably 50 to 92 wt. %. The seed latex, preferably a butadiene polymer (PB) latex, has a mean particle diameter d50 of 10 to 60 nm, preferably 20 to 50 nm. The gel content of the seed latex is 10 to 95 wt. %, preferably 20 to 90 wt. %, and particularly preferably 30 to 85 wt. %. The mean particle diameter d-50 may be determined by ultracentrifuge measurements (see W. Scholtan, H. Lange: Kolloid Z. & Z. Polymere 250, p. 782 to 796 (1972)), the specified values for the gel content referring to the determination according to the wire cage method in toluene (see Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Makromolekulare Stoffe, Part 1 , p. 307 (1961 ), Thieme Verlag Stuttgart). The gel contents of the butadiene polymer latices may in principle be adjusted in a manner known per se by employing suitable reaction conditions (e.g. high reaction temperature and/or polymerization up to a high conversion, as well as optionally the addition of crosslinking substances in order to achieve a high gel content, or for example low reaction temperature and/or termination of the polymerization reaction before too high a degree of crosslinking has occurred, as well as optionally the addition of molecular weight regulators, such as for example n-dodecyl mercaptan or t-dodecyl mercaptan in order to achieve a low gel content). As emulsifiers there may be used conventional anionic emulsifiers such as alkyl sulfates, alkyl sulfonates, aralkyl sulfonates, soaps of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, as well as alkaline dispropor- tionated or hydrogenated abietinic acid or tall oil acid, and preferably emulsifiers are used containing carboxyl groups (e.g. salts of Ci0-Ci8 fatty acids, disproportionated abietinic acid, emulsifiers according to DE-OS 36 39 904 and DE-OS 39 13 509). The preparation of the graft rubber polymers (A1 ), (A2) and (A3) may be carried out in any appropriate manner by separate grafting of the butadiene polymer latices (a1 ), (a2) and (a3) in separate reactions or by joint grafting of arbitrary mixtures selected from the butadiene polymer latices (a1 ), (a2) and (a3) during one reaction or two reactions or three reactions. In this connection the graft polymerization(s) may be carried out according to any suitable processes but is/are preferably carried out in such a way that the monomer mixture is continuously added to the butadiene polymer latex (a1 ) and/or to the butadiene polymer latex (a2) and/or to the butadiene polymer latex (a3) and/or to arbitrary mix- tures selected from the butadiene polymer latices (a1 ), (a2) and (a3), and is polymerised. In this connection special monomer/rubber ratios are preferably maintained and the monomers are added in a manner known per se to the rubber. In order to produce the components (A1 ), (A2) and (A3) according to the preferred embodiment of the invention, preferably 15 to 50 parts by weight, particularly preferably 20 to 40 parts by weight, of a mixture of styrene and acrylonitrile that may optionally contain up to 50 wt. % (referred to the total amount of the monomers used in the graft polymerization) of one or more monomers, are polymerised in the presence of 50 to 85 parts by weight, preferably 60 to 80 parts by weight (in each case referred to solids) of the butadiene polymer latex (a1 ) and/or of the butadiene polymer latex (a2) and/or of the butadiene polymer latex (a3) and/or arbitrary mixtures selected from the butadiene polymer latices (a1 ), (a2), and (a3). The monomers used in the graft polymerization are preferably mixtures of styrene and acrylonitrile in a weight ratio of 95:5 to 50:50, particularly preferably in a weight ratio of 80:20 to 65:35, wherein styrene and/or acrylonitrile may be wholly or partially replaced by copolymerisable monomers, preferably by [alpha]-methylstyrene, methyl methacry- late or N-phenylmaleimide. In principle arbitrary further copolymerisable vinyl monomers may additionally be used in amounts of up to ca. 10 wt. % (referred to the total amount of the monomers). In particular preferred as graft monomers are mixtures of styrene and acrylonitrile alone in a weight ratio of 95:5 to 50:50, particularly preferably in a weight ratio of 80:20 to 65:35. In addition molecular weight regulators may be used in the graft polymerization, preferably in amounts of 0.01 to 2 wt. %, particularly preferably in amounts of 0.05 to 1 wt. % (in each case referred to the total amount of monomers in the graft polymerization stage). Suitable molecular weight regulators are for example alkyl mercaptans such as n- dodecyl mercaptan, t-dodecyl mercaptan; dimeric [alpha]-methylstyrene; terpinolene.

Redox systems consist as a rule of an organic oxidising agent and a reducing agent, in which connection heavy metal ions may in addition be present in the reaction medium (see Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Vol. 14/1 , pp. 263 to 297). The polymerization temperature is in general 25°C to 160 °C, preferably 40°C to 90° C. Suitable emulsifiers are mentioned above.

In addition to the polycondensation process mentioned above, other processes for the preparation of the polycarbonates of the invention are polycondensation in a homoge- neous phase and transesterification. The suitable processes are disclosed in the incorporated herein by reference US-Patents 3,028,365; 2,999,846; 3,153,008 and 2,991 ,273. The preferred process for the preparation of polycarbonates is the interfa- cial polycondensation process. Other methods of synthesis in forming the polycarbonates of the invention such as disclosed in US 3,912,688, may be used. Suitable polycarbonate resins are available in commerce, for instance, Makrolon® FCR, Makrolon 2600, Makrolon 2800 and Makrolon 3100, all of which are bisphenol based homopolycarbonate resins differing in terms of their respective molecular weights and characterized in that their melt flow indices (MFR) per ASTM D-1238 are about 16.5 to 24, 13 to 16, 7.5 to 13.0 and 3.5 to 6.5 g/10 min., respectively. These are products of Bayer MaterialScience. A polycarbonate resin suitable in the practice of the invention is known and its structure and methods of preparation have been disclosed, for example, in US-Patents 3,030,331 ; 3,169,121 ; 3,395,1 19; 3,729,447; 4,255,556; 4,260,731 ; 4,369,303; and 5,227,458. As already mentioned above, in addition, the composition of the invention may advan- tageously contain usual additives (D) such as plasticizers, waxes, antioxidants, plating additives, silicone oil, stabilizers, flame-retardants, fibers, mineral fibers, mineral fillers, dyes, pigments and the like. The preparation of the inventive polymer composition follows conventional procedures which are well known in the art. Usually, however, they are extrusion blended or compounded in a high intensity blender such as a Banbury Mixer or twin-screw extruder. The inventive thermoplastic molding composition can be formed into shaped articles by a variety of means such as injection molding, extrusion, compression forming, vacuum forming, blow molding etc. well established in the art. One further subject of the invention is the use of the inventive polymer blend for electroplating. A further subject of the invention is a metal-plated shaped article comprising the aforementioned inventive polymer blend. The surface of the shaped article is at least partially or preferably totally coated with one or more electroplated metal. The metal-plated shaped article is obtainable by usual processes for metal plating of polymer blends such as a i) conventional electroplating process or ii) a direct plating process. Such processes have been already described and are known in the art. A suitable conventional electroplating process i) usually comprises the following steps: i1 ) providing of a substrate made from the (inventive) polymer blend, 12) optionally cleaning/rinsing, 13) etching, 14) activation, 15) acceleration, 16) electroless chemical metal plating (e.g. nickel), 17) deposition of one or more metal layers (e.g. copper, nickel, chromium) by electroplating. A suitable direct plating process ii) usually comprises the following steps: N1 ) providing of a substrate made from the inventive polymer blend, N2) optionally cleaning/rinsing, N3) etching, N4) activation, N5) deposition of one or more metal layers by electroplating (e.g. copper, nickel, chromium). For the preparation of the metal-plated shaped article the conventional electroplating process is preferred. The etching process is carried out by use of usual etching reagents such as a system based on chromic acid. For the activation and acceleration step commonly used agents for this purpose can be used. Pd/Sn-solutions for activation are preferably used. The thickness of the single layers is in the range of from 0.1 to 50 μηη. The chemical deposited layer, if present, is usually a thin layer in the range of from 0.1 to 0.5 μηη. The top layer is preferably a copper, nickel or chromium layer. In automotive applica- tions the top layer is usually a chromium layer. A further subject of the invention is the use of the afore-mentioned inventive metal- plated - in particular chromium-plated - shaped article comprising the inventive polymer composition for automotive applications, in particular exterior applications such as au- tomotive front grilles and wheel covers. The metal-plated polymer blend shows an improved adhesion between the metal layer and the plastic material. Furthermore the plating grade and thermal cycling adherence of the inventive polymer blend is improved and the mechanical properties are excellent. The invention is further described by the following examples and claims.

The copolymer contains 75.5 weight % styrene and 24.5 weight % acrylonitrile. Molding compositions Each of the exemplified compositions (see Table 1 ) contained 0.2 parts by weight of butyl stearate per 100 parts by weight resin of the total of components A, B, and C. An extrusion process physically blended the components of the polymer blends of each example. This was carried out in a commercially available 34 mm Leistritz twin-screw extruder (24: 1 L : D screw; 250 revolutions per minute; at 260°C). A commercial antioxidant having no criticality in the present context was included in the compositional makeup at a level of 0.1 % by weight. The die temperature was 260°C. The extruded material is passed through a water bath and pelletized. The pelletized material is then injection molded into specimens for testing. A part of the specimens was directly tested in a multi axial impact test according to DIN EN ISO 6603-2. Melt flow (MVR 220 °C / 10 kg) was measured according to ISO 1 133. Peel strength was measured according to ASTM-D 903. The "Temperature range possible for molded plaques" was determined by step-wise increasing injection molding temperature, beginning at 170 °C, by 10 °C. Samples were taken at each step and the optical quality of the sample was determined by a collective of 5 persons. Scales of optical assessments were: 1 = glossy, defect free surface; 2 = glossy surface but with small defects; 3 = partly glossy and significant defects; 4 = incomplete filling of the mold. Once a specimen scored between 1 and 2, the related injection molding temperature was approved as being suitable for molding. Another part of the specimens was metal plated: Plated plaques tested for the peel test according to DIN 53494 were prepared under the following electroplating bath conditions: Chromic acid etching 9 minutes at 68.4°C Activator: 3 minutes at 24.6°C pretreatment: colloidal Accelerator: 3 minutes at 50.4°C pretreatment: colloidal Chemical Nickel: 10 minutes at 63.9°C Pre-Nickel: 10 minutes at 50.7°C Copper: 60 minutes at 20°C current density: 3 A/dm2 The copper layer had a thickness of 40 μ Plated plaques tested for the multi axial impact test according to DIN EN ISO 6603-2 were prepared under the following electroplating bath conditions: Chromic acid etching: 9 minutes at 67.9°C Activator: 3 minutes at 25.5°C pretreatment: colloidal Accelerator: 3 minutes at 50.2°C pretreatment: colloidal Chemical Nickel: 10 minutes at 64.1 °C Pre-Nickel: 10 minutes at 51.3°C Copper: 30 minutes at 20°C current density: 3 A/dm2 Bright Nickel: 10 minutes at 53.3°C current density: 3 A/dm2 Table 1 shows the composition (in weight percent) of the polymer blends tested and the corresponding mechanical data obtained by the afore-mentioned tests.
