Methyl-d3 (R)-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenylsulfonyloxy)-acetate (II-1)
10.2 g of methyl-d3 (R)-o-chloromandelate was dissolved in 50 mL of anhydrous methylene chloride, into which 65.6 g of triethylamine and catalytic amount of DMAP was added, stirred, and cooled to 0Â°C. 50 mL anhydrous methylene chloride solution of 12.2 g p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride was dropwise added at the same temperature to react for 4 hours at a constant temperature. 100 mL of water was added into the reaction solution, stirred, allowed to stand still to separate the liquid. The aqueous phase was extracted for three times with 150 mL of methylene chloride and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate after combining the organic phases. The methylene chloride was dried out under reduced pressure after removing the desiccant by filtration to obtain 20.9 g of oily crude product in dark red. The resultant substance was recrystallized with methanol to give 15.8 g of solid product (11-1), with a yield of 81.3%.
