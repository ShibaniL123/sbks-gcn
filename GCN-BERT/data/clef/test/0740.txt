RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application is filed under 35 U.S.C. §371 as the U.S. national phase of International Application PCT/US2011/023657 filed Feb. 3, 2011, which designated the U.S. and claims priority to the U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/301,042, filed on Feb. 3, 2010, by Mark E. Hediger, and entitled “MULTIPLE SUBSTITUTED FLUOROMETHANES AS SELECTIVE AND BIOACTIVE ISOSTERES”, the entire disclosure of both of which, including the drawings, is hereby incorporated by reference herein. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The disclosure herein relates to substituted trifluoromethanes and difluoromethanes that are useful mimics of biological phosphate. The disclosure further relates to compositions containing the substituted fluoromethane functionality and the processes of preparing and methods of identifying and utilizing such compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE Biological phosphate fulfills a central role in energy-transduction manifolds as well as biosynthetic and cellular signaling pathways in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In spite of this fundamental role for phosphorylated biomolecules in cellular processes, significant limitations are encountered by those studying these pathways due to the unique charged nature of both the intermediates and the mimics historically employed as molecular probes of these processes (Knowles, J. R. Ada Doisy Lecture, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1985). The paradox surrounding phosphate remains: The unique anionic character of biological phosphate and the controlled lability of this functional group remain the crux of cellular energetics and regulation; nonetheless, these very molecular properties are the essence of the challenges faced by those seeking to understand a multitude of cellular processes at the molecular level as well as those endeavoring to impact clinical outcomes. Through integrated design considerations disclosed herein, these mechanistic chemistries, biophysical properties and mimicries of biological phosphorylation may serve as the three-fold basis of a fundamental approach towards small molecule interrogations of these biological processes and the resultant medical interventions. A novel, specific and physiologically stable mimic of this key biological switch would greatly enhance multiple approaches towards a more complete understanding of cellular processes surrounding phosphorylated intermediates and compounds. Such a specific biological probe would serve as a powerful research tool at the molecular level and as a potential gateway entry into the fields of diagnostic reporters and pharmaceuticals at the level of the entire organism. Multiple techniques for evaluation of such an appropriate probe would be enhanced by the unique atomic characteristics of a well-designed and specific mimic. Increased bioavailabilities may directly correspond with enhanced sensitivities in diagnostic settings, while higher potencies and greater selectivities at specific targets and receptors may be realized in clinical pharmaceutical applications. The transient, selective and site-specific covalent attachment of a phosphate group to various biological molecules is one of the most (if not the) fundamental mechanisms of cellular regulation at the molecular level (Dzeja, P. P. and Terzic, A. J Exp Bio 206: 2039 (2003)). The potential of this isosteric replacement to positively impact clinical outcomes in the context of cell signaling processes, energetic transformations, ion channel regulation, cell cycle regulation, lipid metabolism, saccharide metabolism and processing, cytoskeletal regulation, DNA and RNA analoging as well as nearly all other biologically relevant phosphate binding events is a fundamental extension of the isostere's molecular design. Furthermore, impact upon the structural role phosphorous plays in bone and tooth development, metabolism and degradation processes is a further contemplated application of the disclosure. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Disclosed herein are substituted fluoromethanes; pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the same; processes for preparing these fluoromethanes; and methods of using the same in alleviating infection and parasitism. Also disclosed are methods for identifying substituted fluoromethanes for modulating the activity of receptors and enzymes that bind and/or modify phosphate containing ligands and substrates.

Pharmaceutical Preparations In another aspect, disclosed herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of any one of Formula I or II and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, or diluent. As used herein, a “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount of a compound that elicits the desired biological or medicinal response in a subject. As used herein, a “pharmaceutical composition” refers to a mixture of a compound of this invention with other chemical components such as diluents, carriers or other excipients. A pharmaceutical composition may facilitate administration of the compound to a subject. Many techniques of administering a compound exist are known in the art, such as, without limitation, orally, intramuscularly, intraocularly, intranasally, parenterally, intravenously and topically. Pharmaceutical compositions will generally be tailored to the specific intended route of administration. As used herein, a “carrier” refers to a compound that facilitates the incorporation of a compound into cells or tissues. For example, without limitation, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a commonly utilized carrier that facilitates the uptake of many organic compounds into cells or tissues of a subject. As used herein, a “diluent” refers to an ingredient in a pharmaceutical composition that lacks pharmacological activity but may be pharmaceutically necessary or desirable. For example, a diluent may be used to increase the bulk of a potent drug whose mass is too small for manufacture or administration. It may also be a liquid for the dissolution of a drug to be administered by injection, ingestion or inhalation. A common form of diluent in the art is a buffered aqueous solution such as, without limitation, phosphate buffered saline that mimics the composition of human blood. The compounds of this invention can be administered to a subject per se, or in a pharmaceutical composition where they are mixed with other active ingredients as, for example, in a combination therapy, or suitable carriers or excipient(s). Techniques for formulation and administration of the compounds of the instant application may be found in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,” Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 18th edition, 1990. Suitable routes of administration may, without limitation, include oral, rectal, transmucosal, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intraperitoneal, intranasal, intraocular injections or as an aerosol inhalant. Alternatively, one may administer the compound in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the compound directly into the area of pain or inflammation, often in a depot or sustained release formulation. Furthermore, one may administer the drug in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with a tissue-specific antibody. The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the organ. The pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be manufactured procedures well-known in the art, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or tabletting processes. Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present disclosure thus may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations, which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. Any of the well-known techniques, carriers, and excipients may be used as suitable and as understood in the art; e.g., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, above. For injection, the agents disclosed herein may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated readily by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds disclosed herein to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by mixing one or more solid excipient with pharmaceutical combination disclosed herein, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses. Pharmaceutical preparations, which can be used orally, include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present disclosure are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, e.g., gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances, which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents, which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly, concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt. A pharmaceutical carrier for the hydrophobic compounds disclosed herein is a co-solvent system comprising benzyl alcohol, a nonpolar surfactant, a water-miscible organic polymer, and an aqueous phase. A common co-solvent system used is the VPD co-solvent system, which is a solution of 3% w/v benzyl alcohol, 8% w/v of the nonpolar surfactant Polysorbate 80™, and 65% w/v polyethylene glycol 300, made up to volume in absolute ethanol. Naturally, the proportions of a co-solvent system may be varied considerably without destroying its solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of the co-solvent components may be varied: for example, other low-toxicity nonpolar surfactants may be used instead of Polysorbate 80™; the fraction size of polyethylene glycol may be varied; other biocompatible polymers may replace polyethylene glycol, e.g., polyvinyl pyrrolidone; and other sugars or polysaccharides may be used. Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for hydrophobic drugs. Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also may be employed, although usually at the cost of greater toxicity. Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various sustained-release materials have been established and are well known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the therapeutic reagent, additional strategies for protein stabilization may be employed. Many of the compounds used in the pharmaceutical combinations disclosed herein may be provided as salts with pharmaceutically compatible counterions. Pharmaceutically compatible salts may be formed with many acids, including but not limited to hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic, lactic, tartaric, malic, succinic, etc. Salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous or other protonic solvents than are the corresponding free acids or base forms. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the methods disclosed herein include compositions where the active ingredients are contained in an amount effective to achieve its intended purpose. More specifically, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount of compound effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of disease or prolong the survival of the subject being treated. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage for the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. (See e.g., Fingl et al. 1975, in “The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics”, Ch. 1 p. 1). Typically, the dose range of the composition administered to the patient can be from about 0.5 to 1000 mg/kg of the patient's body weight, or 1 to 500 mg/kg, or 10 to 500 mg/kg, or 50 to 100 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. The dosage may be a single one or a series of two or more given in the course of one or more days, as is needed by the patient. Note that for almost all of the specific compounds mentioned in the present disclosure, human dosages for treatment of at least some condition have been established. Thus, in most instances, the methods disclosed herein will use those same dosages, or dosages that are between about 0.1% and 500%, or between about 25% and 250%, or between 50% and 100% of the established human dosage. Where no human dosage is established, as will be the case for newly-discovered pharmaceutical compounds, a suitable human dosage can be inferred from ED50 or ID50 values, or other appropriate values derived from in vitro or in vivo studies, as qualified by toxicity studies and efficacy studies in animals. Although the exact dosage will be determined on a drug-by-drug basis, in most cases, some generalizations regarding the dosage can be made. The daily dosage regimen for an adult human patient may be, for example, an oral dose of between 0.1 mg and 500 mg of each ingredient, preferably between 1 mg and 250 mg, e.g. 5 to 200 mg or an intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular dose of each ingredient between 0.01 mg and 100 mg, preferably between 0.1 mg and 60 mg, e.g. 1 to 40 mg of each ingredient of the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof calculated as the free base, the composition being administered 1 to 4 times per day. Alternatively the compositions disclosed herein may be administered by continuous intravenous infusion, preferably at a dose of each ingredient up to 400 mg per day. Thus, the total daily dosage by oral administration of each ingredient will typically be in the range 1 to 2000 mg and the total daily dosage by parenteral administration will typically be in the range 0.1 to 400 mg. Suitably the compounds will be administered for a period of continuous therapy, for example for a week or more, or for months or years. Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active moiety, which are sufficient to maintain the modulating effects, or minimal effective concentration (MEC). The MEC will vary for each compound but can be estimated from in vitro data. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. However, HPLC assays or bioassays can be used to determine plasma concentrations. Dosage intervals can also be determined using MEC value. Compositions should be administered using a regimen, which maintains plasma levels above the MEC for 10-90% of the time, preferably between 30-90% and most preferably between 50-90%. In cases of local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be related to plasma concentration. The amount of composition administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device, which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may for example comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration. The pack or dispenser may also be accompanied with a notice associated with the container in form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use, or sale of pharmaceuticals, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency of the form of the drug for human or veterinary administration. Such notice, for example, may be the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prescription drugs, or the approved product insert. Compositions comprising a compound disclosed herein formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier may also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition. III. Activity of the Compounds In another aspect, disclosed herein is a method of modulating the activity of a phosphoenolpyruvyl transferase (PEPT) enzyme, comprising: contacting the PEPT enzyme with a compound of any one of Formulae I or II as described herein. In some embodiments, the method further comprises the step of detecting a change in the activity of the enzyme, and/or comparing the activity of the enzyme after the contacting to the activity of the enzyme before the contacting. In some embodiments, the compound of any one of Formulae I or II is a competitive inhibitor of the PEPT enzymes. In other embodiments, the compound of any one of Formulae I or II is an un-competitive inhibitor of the PEPT enzymes. In yet other embodiments, the compound of any one of Formula I or II is a non-competitive inhibitor of the PEPT enzymes. In still other embodiments, the compound of any one of Formulae I or II is a mixed inhibitor of the PEPT enzymes. As used herein, to “modulate” the activity of an PEPT enzyme means either to activate it, i.e., to increase its cellular function over the base level measured in the particular environment in which it is found, or deactivate it, i.e., decrease its cellular function to less than the measured base level in the environment in which it is found and/or render it unable to perform its cellular function at all even in the presence of a natural binding partner. A natural substrate partner is an endogenous molecule that is a substrate for the enzyme. As used herein, to “detect” changes in the activity of a PEPT enzyme refers to the process of analyzing the result of an experiment using whatever analytical techniques are best suited to the particular situation. In some cases simple visual observation may suffice, in other cases the use of a microscope, visual or UV light analyzer or specific bioassays may be required. The proper selection of analytical tools and techniques to detect changes in the activity of PEPT enzymes are well-known and will be apparent to those skilled in the art based on the disclosures herein. As used herein, a “competitive inhibitor” refers to a compound that binds to an enzyme in preference over a substrate to form an enzyme-inhibitor complex that modulates the pharmacological response associated with that particular enzyme. As used herein, “uncompetetive inhibitor” refers to a compound that has an affinity for an enzyme-substrate complex to form an enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex that modulates the pharmacological response associated with that particular enzyme. As used herein, “non-competetive inhibitor” refers to a compound that reduces the maximum rate of an ezymatic reaction without changing the apparent binding affinity of the substrate thus modulating the pharmacological response associated with that particular enzyme. As used herein, “mixed inhibitor” refers to a compound that binds to an enzyme or enzyme-substrate complex that changes both the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate and reduces the maximal rate of an enzymatic reaction thus modulating the pharmacological response associated with that particular enzyme. In some embodiments, the above enzyme is contacted with the compound of any one of Formula I or II in vivo, e.g., when the enzyme is in a tissue or in an animal. In other embodiments, the above enzyme is contacted with the compound of any one of Formula I or II in vitro, e.g., in an assay, or when the enzyme is in an intact cell or in a plurality of cells. In some embodiments, the compound of any one of Formulae I or II selectively modulates the PEPT enzyme activity relative to other enzymes that utilize phosphoenolpyruvate as a substrate. In some embodiments, the other enzymes that utilize phosphoenolpyruvate comprise the Krebs cycle enzymes. Throughout the present disclosure, the PEPT enzyme can be selected from the group consisting of a bacterial PEPT enzyme, a fungal PEPT enzyme, a plant PEPT enzyme, a trypanosomal PEPT enzyme, a protozoan PEPT enzyme or any other non-mammalian organism expressing the PEPT enzyme. In another aspect, disclosed herein is a method of alleviating bacterial, fungal or trypanosomal infection or parasitism in a subject, comprising: identifying a subject in need thereof; and administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of any one of Formulae I or II. In some embodiments, the subject is a patient.

EXAMPLES The following examples are provided by way of illustration only and are not intended, nor should they be construed, as limiting the scope of this disclosure in any manner whatsoever. Example 1 Computational Chemistry The isostere disclosure was analyzed using ab initio calculations with density functional theory employing the B3LYP functional and the 6-31G* basis set (Yoo, H. Y. and Houk, K. N. JACS 119: 2877 (1997)). This method is known to provide excellent geometries and electrostatic potentials. Phosphorylated tyrosine (phosphorylated 4-hydroxy phenylalanine) is known to play a key role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. A series of phospho-tyrosine analogues was computationally analyzed in order to obtain a deeper physiochemical understanding of the trifluoromethyl isostere and its coupling by various linkages to the parent phenyl ring. These calculations pointed to the remarkably and extremely similar shapes of the constant electron density surfaces in the case of the phenyl-linker-trifluoromethyl compounds as compared to the native phosphate. Overall electrostatic potentials are not identical due to the inherent charge of the phosphate group at physiological pH. These calculations clearly establish the trifluoromethyl functionality as a viable isostere for phosphate. The desired neutrality of the isostere is clear in these calculations while the overall lack of charge does not impact the constant electron density surface in comparison to the naturally occurring phosphate. The energetics of solvation was examined across a wider set of trifluoromethyl analogues. The calculated dipole moments in aqueous solution for these compounds are presented along with the values for the neutral, monoanionic, and dianionic phenyl phosphates. In no case examined is the isostere found to be ionic. These results are presented in Table 1.

Dipole calculations analogous to those performed in the context of phospho-tyrosine were performed on the phosphorylated portion of the herbicide Glyphosate® [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine, CAS1017-83-6] along with a set of trifluoromethyl-containing analogues. The ionics of the glyphosate molecule are well-known and these dipole calculations verify the similarity of the isostere to the phosphate. As in the case of the phospho-tyrosine analogues, the trifluoromethyl isostere was not ionized under any conditions explored by this calculation. These results are presented in Table 2.

Bromoacetic acid (2.78 g) was dissolved in water (10 ml), and the pH was adjusted to 9 with 1M aqueous KOH. This solution of bromoacetic acid was added in portions with stirring to the solution of the amine over 1 hour. The pH of the mixture was kept at 8-9 by addition of 1M KOH. The solution was left overnight at room temperature. In the morning the pH was 6.7; the solution was adjusted again to pH 9.5 with 1M KOH and the solution kept at pH 8.5-9 as above. After 1.5 hours, the reaction mixture was concentrated under vacuum (˜30 mL), and the pH was adjusted again to 9. After 3 hours the solution was heated to 65° C. for 4 hours, cooled and left in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, the pH was 7.2, and there was some precipitate. The pH was adjusted to 6 by addition of 2 M aqueous HBr, and the precipitate dissolved. A 0.1 ml aliquot was dried to a solid under vacuum, re-evaporated from D2O, and dissolved in 0.7 ml D2O. 1H NMR and 13C NMR showed the product as a mixture of Im and In in a ratio of 3:1. The reaction mixture was analyzed by LC-MS. Approximately 1/50 of the solution was mixed with 1/10 of its volume 2M TEAA, and was injected on Gemini C18 20×250 mm column, and eluted with a gradient from 0 to 5% acetonitrile for 45 min at 10 ml/min. The target compound eluted late, and, after evaporation, 5 mg pure Im was obtained. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness to leave 8.07 g of solid. Sublimation A 0.44 g sample of this solid was loaded in a sublimation apparatus, dried overnight under high vacuum at room temperature and sublimed by gradual increase from room temperature to 170° C. Sublimation began at approximately 85° C., and was fast above 100° C. The sublimate was dissolved in water/MeOH, and the solution evaporated to give 89.1 mg of pure Im. The residue was acidified with trifluoroacetic acid to approximately pH 2, evaporated to dryness, and resublimed. The sublimate consisted of 67 mg of Im, and the residue contained pure In. Large-Scale Sublimation The remaining solid (6.52 g) was sublimed as above. The flask was heated gradually to 150° C., and held at 150° C. for 30 minutes. The sublimate was dissolved in water/MeOH (˜5.8 mL). An aliquot (0.3 mL) was evaporated to a semi-solid that solidified on standing to give 81.3 mg of Im. The balance of the sample was concentrated in the same manner to yield 4.80 g of Im as a white powder. Characterization of Im: 1H NMR: (D2O) δ 3.79 (s, 2H), 3.87 (q, 2H). 13C NMR: (D2O) δ 46.52 (four line pattern), 48.85, 121.99 (four line pattern), 169.81. 19F NMR: (D2O) δ −68.82 (t, 3F).

Compound Io ((3,3,3-Trifluoro-propylamino)-acetic acid)) Trifluoropropylamine (0.46 g) was added with cooling to 98% formic acid (10 mL). Glyoxylic acid (0.78 g) was added, and the mixture was heated in a 50° C. water bath. After 16 hours, an aliquot (50 μl) was evaporated under vacuum, and the residue evaporated twice from 1 ml of D2O. 1H NMR showed ˜10% unreacted amine and 90% of the formylated adduct. Additional glyoxylic acid hydrate (0.078 g) was added, and the reaction mixture was heated at 75° C. in a water bath. After 2 hours an aliquot (50 μl) was evaporated and the residue evaporated from D2O. 1H NMR showed less amine present. After an additional 2.5 hours, the reaction mixture was evaporated, and the residue evaporated from water (5 ml), to give 1.15 g of clear oil. The oil was dissolved in 1M aqueous HCl (8.1 mL), and the solution was heated at 95° C. for 2.5 hours. The 1H NMR showed ca. 85% conversion to the deformylated product, Io. After refluxing for another 1.5 hours, the reaction mixture was left at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was evaporated to a semisolid. This material was dissolved in MeOH (˜5 ml) and left in a freezer overnight. This suspension of crystals was reduced to ˜2-3 mL, and diethyl ether (˜10 ml) was added. This suspension was left at room temperature for 30 minutes and the crystalline precipitate was centrifuged and washed with 10 ml diethyl ether. The crystals were dried at high vacuum to give Io (0.88 g) as a white solid. A larger scale preparation was performed to give Io (3.10 g) as a white powder. This process was developed from a similar approach (Kihlberg, J. et al Acta Chem Scan B 37: 911-916 (1983)).
