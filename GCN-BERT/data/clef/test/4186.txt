BINDING FUNCTION 3 (BF3) SITE COMPOUNDS AS THERAPEUTICS AND METHODS FOR THEIR USE TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to therapeutics, their uses and methods for the treatment of various indications, including various cancers. In particular the invention relates to therapies and methods of treatment for cancers such as prostate cancer. BACKGROUND Androgens are known to mediate their effects through the androgen receptor (AR). Androgens play a role in a wide range of developmental and physiological responses, for example, male sexual differentiation, maintenance of spermatogenesis, and male gonadotropin regulation (R. K. Ross, G. A. Coetzee, C. L. Pearce, J. K. Reichardt, P. Bretsky, L. N. Kolonel, B. E. Henderson, E. Lander, D. Altshuler & G. Daley, Eur Urol 35, 355-361 (1999); A. A. Thomson, Reproduction 121, 187-195 (2001); N. Tanji, K. Ao & M. Yokoyama, ArchAndrol 47, 1-7 (2001)). Also, androgens are associated with the development of prostate carcinogenesis. Induction of prostatic carcinogenesis in rodent models has been associated with androgens (R. L. Noble, Cancer Res 37, 1929-1933 (1977); R. L. Noble, Oncology 34, 138-141 (1977)) and men receiving androgens in the form of anabolic steroids are reported to have a higher incidence of prostate cancer (J. T. Roberts & D. M. Essenhigh, Lancet 2, 742 (1986); J. A, Jackson, J. Waxman & A. M. Spiekerman, Arch Intern Med 149, 2365-2366 (1989); P. D. Guinan, W. Sadoughi, H. Alsheik, R. J. Ablin, D. Alrenga & I. M. Bush, Am J Surg 131, 599-600 (1976)). Furthermore, prostate cancer does not develop if humans or dogs are castrated before puberty (J. D. Wilson & C. Roehrborn, J Clin Endocrinol Metab 84, 4324-4331 (1999); G. Wilding, Cancer Surv 14, 113-130 (1992)). Castration of adult males causes involution of the prostate and apoptosis of prostatic epithelium (E. M. Bruckheimer & N. Kyprianou, Cell Tissue Res 301, 153-162 (2000); J. T. Isaacs, Prostate 5, 545-557 (1984)). This dependency on androgens provides the underlying rationale for treating prostate cancer with chemical or surgical castration (i.e. androgen ablation). Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of male cancer-related death in Western countries (Damber, J. E. and Aus, G. Lancet (2008) 371:1710-1721). Numerous studies have shown that the androgen receptor (AR) is central not only to the development of prostate cancer, but also the progression of the disease to the castration resistance state (Taplin, M. E. et al. J. Clin. Oncol. (2003) 21:2673-8; and Tilley, W. D. et al. Cancer Res. (1994) 54:4096- 4102). Thus, effective inhibition of human AR remains one of the most effective therapeutic approaches to the treatment of advanced, metastatic prostate cancer. The AR possesses a modular organization characteristic of all nuclear receptors. It is comprised of an N-terminal domain, a central DNA binding domain, a short hinge region, and C-terminal domain that contains a hormone ligand binding pocket and the Activation Function-2 (AF2) site (Gao, W. Q. et al. Chem. Rev. (2005) 105:3352-3370). The latter represents a hydrophobic groove on the AR surface which is flanked with regions of positive and negative charges -"charge clamps" that are significant for binding AR activation factors (Zhou, X. E. et al. J. Biol. Chem. (2010) 285:9161-9171). Recent studies have identified a novel site on the AR called Binding Function 3 (BF3) that is involved into AR transcriptional activity. It has been proposed a small molecule bound to the BF3 site could cause the AR protein to undergo an allosteric modification that prevents AR interactions with co- activators. Importantly, the BF3 site is located near, but distinct from, the ligand-binding site that is normally targeted by conventional anti-androgen drugs. Chemicals such as flufenamic acid (FLUF), thriiodothyronine (T3) and 3,3',5 -triiodo thyroacetic acid (TRIAC), can bind to the BF3 cleft, inhibit AF2 interactions and interfere with AR activity (Estebanez- Perpina, E. et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A (2007) 104:16074-16079). While these compounds revealed the importance of the BF3 site, they have shown a low potency (IC50 > 5θμΜ) and were found to bind non-specifically to the AR. The activation of AR follows a well characterized pathway: in the cytoplasm, the receptor is associated with chaperone proteins that maintain agonist binding conformation of the AR (Georget, V. et al. Biochemistry (2002) 41:11824-11831). Upon binding of an androgen, the AR undergoes a series of conformational changes, disassociation from chaperones, dimerization and translocation into the nucleus (Fang, Y. F. et al. J. Biol. Chem. (1996) 271:28697-28702; and Wong, C. I. et al. J. Biol. Chem. (1993) 268:19004-19012) where it further interacts with co-activator proteins at the AF2 site (Zhou, X. E. et al. J. Biol. Chem. (2010) 285:9161-9171). This event triggers the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and other factors to form a functional transcriptional complex with the AR. Notably, the current anti-androgens such as bicalutamide, fiutamide, nilutamide and MDV3100, all target this particular process. However, instead of affecting the AR-cofactor interaction directly, these anti-androgens act indirectly, by binding to the AR ligand binding site. Thus, by preventing androgens from binding they also prevent conformational changes of the receptor that are necessary for co-activator interactions. While treatment with these AR inhibitors can initially suppress the prostate cancer growth, long term hormone therapy becomes progressively less effective (Taplin, M. E. et al. J. Clin. Oncol. (2003) 21:2673-8; and Tilley, W. D. et al. Cancer Res. (1994) 54:4096-4102). Factors that make the AR less sensitive to conventional anti-androgens include resistance mutations at the ligand binding site that can even lead AR antagonists to act as agonists further contributing to cancer progression (Chen, Y. era/. Lancet Oncol. (2009) 10:981-991). Androgens also play a role in female cancers. One example is ovarian cancer where elevated levels of androgens are associated with an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer (K.J. Helzlsouer, et al, JAMA 274, 1926-1930 (1995); R J. Edmondson, et al, Br J Cancer 86, 879-885 (2002)). The AR has been detected in a majority of ovarian cancers (H. A. Risch, J Natl Cancer Inst 90, 1774-1786 (1998); B. R Rao & B. J. Slotman, Endocr Rev 12, 14-26 (1991); G. M. Clinton & W. Hua, Oz'f Rev Oncol Hematol 25, 1-9 (1997)), whereas estrogen receptor-alpha (ERa) and the progesterone receptor are detected in less than 50% of ovarian tumors.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The BF3 site is an attractive target for direct inhibition of the AR co-activation. In silico computational drug discovery methods were used to conduct a virtual screen of ~4 million purchasable lead-like compounds from the ZINC database (Irwin, J. et al. Abstracts of Papers Am. Chem. Soc. (2005) 230:111009) to identify potential BF3 binders. The in silico methods included large-scale docking, in-site rescoring and consensus voting procedures. It will be understood by a person of skill that COOH and NR2 may include the corresponding ions, for example carboxylate ions and ammonium ions, respectively. Alternatively, where the ions are shown, a person of skill in the art will appreciate that the counter ion may also be present. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the point of covalent attachment of the moiety to the compounds as described herein may be, for example, and without limitation, cleaved under specified conditions. Specified conditions may include, for example, and without limitation, in vivo enzymatic or non-enzymatic means. Cleavage of the moiety may occur, for example, and without limitation, spontaneously, or it may be catalyzed, induced by another agent, or a change in a physical parameter or environmental parameter, for example, an enzyme, light, acid, temperature or pH. The moiety maybe, for example, and without limitation, a protecting group that acts to mask a functional group, a group that acts as a substrate for one or more active or passive transport mechanisms, or a group that acts to impart or enhance a property of the compound, for example, solubility, bioavailability or localization. In some embodiments, compounds of Formula I or Formula II above may be used for systemic treatment of at least one indication selected from the group consisting of: prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, hair loss, acne, hirsutism, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary disease, precocious puberty and age-related macular degeneration. In some embodiments compounds of Formula I or Formula II may be used in the preparation of a medicament or a composition for systemic treatment of an indication described herein. In some embodiments, methods of systemically treating any of the indications described herein are also provided. Compounds as described herein may be in the free form or in the form of a salt thereof. In some embodiment, compounds as described herein may be in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, which are known in the art (Berge S. M. et al., J. Pharm. Sci. (1977) 66(i):i-i9). Pharmaceutically acceptable salt as used herein includes, for example, salts that have the desired pharmacological activity of the parent compound (salts which retain the biological effectiveness and/or properties of the parent compound and which are not biologically and/or otherwise undesirable). Compounds as described herein having one or more functional groups capable of forming a salt may be, for example, formed as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Compounds containing one or more basic functional groups maybe capable of forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt with, for example, a pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be derived from, for example, and without limitation, acetic acid, adipic acid, alginic acid, aspartic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, butyric acid, cinnamic acid, citric acid, camphoric acid, camphorsulfonic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, diethylacetic acid, digluconic acid, dodecylsulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, glucoheptanoic acid, gluconic acid, glycerophosphoric acid, glycolic acid, hemisulfonic acid, heptanoic acid, hexanoic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, isonicotinic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, 2-napthalenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulphonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, nicotinic acid, nitric acid, oxalic acid, pamoic acid, pectinic acid, 3-phenylpropionic acid, phosphoric acid, picric acid, pimelic acid, pivalic acid, propionic acid, pyruvic acid, salicylic acid, succinic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, tartaric acid, thiocyanic acid or undecanoic acid. Compounds containing one or more acidic functional groups may be capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable base, for example, and without limitation, inorganic bases based on alkaline metals or alkaline earth metals or organic bases such as primary amine compounds, secondary amine compounds, tertiary amine compounds, quaternary amine compounds, substituted amines, naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines or basic ion-exchange resins. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be derived from, for example, and without limitation, a hydroxide, carbonate, or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation such as ammonium, sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese or aluminum, ammonia, benzathine, meglumine, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, isopropylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, 2-diethylaminoethanol, dicyclohexylamine, lysine, arginine, histidine, caffeine, hydrabamine, choline, betaine, ethylenediamine, glucosamine, glucamine, methylglucamine, theobromine, purines, piperazine, piperidine, procaine, N- ethylpiperidine, theobromine, tetramethylammonium compounds, tetraethylammonium compounds, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline, N-methylpiperidine, morpholine, N- methylmorpholine, N-ethylmorpholine, dicyclohexylamine, dibenzylamine, N,N- dibenzylphenethylamine, i-ephenamine, Ν,Ν'-dibenzylethylenediamine or polyamine resins. In some embodiments, compounds as described herein may contain both acidic and basic groups and may be in the form of inner salts or zwitterions, for example, and without limitation, betaines. Salts as described herein may be prepared by conventional processes known to a person skilled in the art, for example, and without limitation, by reacting the free form with an organic acid or inorganic acid or base, or by anion exchange or cation exchange from other salts. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that preparation of salts may occur in situ during isolation and purification of the compounds or preparation of salts may occur by separately reacting an isolated and purified compound. In some embodiments, compounds and all different forms thereof (e.g. free forms, salts, polymorphs, isomeric forms) as described herein may be in the solvent addition form, for example, solvates. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent in physical association the compound or salt thereof. The solvent may be, for example, and without limitation, a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent. For example, hydrates are formed when the solvent is water or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is an alcohol. In some embodiments, compounds and all different forms thereof (e.g. free forms, salts, solvates, isomeric forms) as described herein may include crystalline and amorphous forms, for example, polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs, conformational polymorphs, amorphous forms, or a combination thereof. Polymorphs include different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability and/or solubility. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various factors including recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate. In some embodiments, compounds and all different forms thereof (e.g. free forms, salts, solvates, polymorphs) as described herein include isomers such as geometrical isomers, optical isomers based on asymmetric carbon, stereoisomers, tautomers, individual enantiomers, individual diastereomers, racemates, diastereomeric mixtures and combinations thereof, and are not limited by the description of the formula illustrated for the sake of convenience. In some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions as described herein may comprise a salt of such a compound, preferably a pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable salt. Pharmaceutical preparations will typically comprise one or more carriers, excipients or diluents acceptable for the mode of administration of the preparation, be it by injection, inhalation, topical administration, lavage, or other modes suitable for the selected treatment. Suitable carriers, excipients or diluents (used interchangeably herein) are those known in the art for use in such modes of administration. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated by means known in the art and their mode of administration and dose determined by the skilled practitioner. For parenteral administration, a compound may be dissolved in sterile water or saline or a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle used for administration of non-water soluble compounds such as those used for vitamin K. For enteral administration, the compound may be administered in a tablet, capsule or dissolved in liquid form. The tablet or capsule may be enteric coated, or in a formulation for sustained release. Many suitable formulations are known, including, polymeric or protein microparticles encapsulating a compound to be released, ointments, pastes, gels, hydrogels, or solutions which can be used topically or locally to administer a compound. A sustained release patch or implant may be employed to provide release over a prolonged period of time. Many techniques known to one of skill in the art are described in Remington: the Science & Practice of Pharmacy by Alfonso Gennaro, 20th ed., Lippencott Williams & Wilkins, (2000). Formulations for parenteral administration may, for example, contain excipients, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, or hydrogenated naphthalenes. Biocompatible, biodegradable lactide polymer, lactide/glycolide copolymer, or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers may be used to control the release of the compounds. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for modulatory compounds include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes. Formulations for inhalation may contain excipients, for example, lactose, or may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or maybe oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops, or as a gel. Compounds or pharmaceutical compositions as described herein or for use as described herein may be administered by means of a medical device or appliance such as an implant, graft, prosthesis, stent, etc. Also, implants may be devised which are intended to contain and release such compounds or compositions. An example would be an implant made of a polymeric material adapted to release the compound over a period of time. An "effective amount" of a pharmaceutical composition as described herein includes a therapeutically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount. A "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result, such as reduced tumor size, increased life span or increased life expectancy. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the subject, and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the subject. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the compound are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A "prophylactically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result, such as smaller tumors, increased life span, increased life expectancy or prevention of the progression of prostate cancer to an androgen-independent form. Typically, a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, so that a prophylactically effective amount may be less than a therapeutically effective amount. It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. For any particular subject, specific dosage regimens may be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions. Dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and do not limit the dosage ranges that may be selected by medical practitioners. The amount of active compound(s) in the composition may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the subject. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It may be advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. In some embodiments, compounds and all different forms thereof as described herein may be used, for example, and without limitation, in combination with other treatment methods for at least one indication selected from the group consisting of: prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, hair loss, acne, hirsutism, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary disease, precocious puberty and age-related macular degeneration. For example, compounds and all their different forms as described herein may be used as neoadjuvant (prior), adjunctive (during), and/or adjuvant (after) therapy with surgery, radiation (brachytherapy or external beam), or other therapies (eg. HIFU). In general, compounds as described herein should be used without causing substantial toxicity. Toxicity of the compounds as described herein can be determined using standard techniques, for example, by testing in cell cultures or experimental animals and determining the therapeutic index, i.e., the ratio between the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the LD100 (the dose lethal to 100% of the population). In some circumstances however, such as in severe disease conditions, it maybe appropriate to administer substantial excesses of the compositions. Some compounds as described herein may be toxic at some concentrations. Titration studies may be used to determine toxic and non-toxic concentrations. Toxicity may be evaluated by examining a particular compound's or composition's specificity across cell lines using PC3 cells as a negative control that do not express AR. Animal studies may be used to provide an indication if the compound has any effects on other tissues. Systemic therapy that targets the AR will not likely cause major problems to other tissues since anti-androgens and androgen insensitiviry syndrome are not fatal. Compounds as described herein may be administered to a subject. As used herein, a "subject" may be a human, non-human primate, rat, mouse, cow, horse, pig, sheep, goat, dog, cat, etc. The subject may be suspected of having or at risk for having a cancer, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer or endometrial cancer, or suspected of having or at risk for having acne, hirsutism, alopecia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary disease, precocious puberty, or age-related macular degeneration. Diagnostic methods for various cancers, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer or endometrial cancer, and diagnostic methods for acne, hirsutism, alopecia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary disease, precocious puberty, or age-related macular degeneration and the clinical delineation of cancer, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer or endometrial cancer, diagnoses and the clinical delineation of acne, hirsutism, alopecia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary disease, precocious puberty, or age-related macular degeneration are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Definitions used include ligand-dependent activation of the androgen receptor (AR) by androgens such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or the synthetic androgen (R1881) used for research purposes. Ligand-independent activation of the AR refers to transactivation of the AR in the absence of androgen (ligand) by, for example, stimulation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway with forskolin (FSK). Some compounds and compositions as described herein may interfere with a mechanism specific to ligand-dependent activation (e.g., accessibility of the ligand binding domain (LBD) to androgen) or to ligand-independent activation of the AR, Various alternative embodiments and examples of the invention are described herein. These embodiments and examples are illustrative and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. MATERIALS AND METHODS In silico screening Ten million commercially available compounds from the ZINC12.0 structural libraries (Irwin, J.J. and Shoichet, B. K. ZINC— a free database of commercially available compounds for virtual screening. J Chem Inf Model 2005, 45, 177-182) were imported into a molecular database using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) version 2007.09 (MOE, Chemical Computing Group, Inc., 2008, www.chemcomp.com). These structures were energy minimized using an MMFF94X force field, exported in SD format and rigidly docked into the BF3 site of the protein structures 4HLW with Glide software (Friesner, R.A. et al. Glide: a new approach for rapid, accurate docking and scoring. 1. Method and assessment of docking accuracy. J Med Chem. 2004, 25, 739-49). About 2 million molecules that had a GlideScoreo 5.0 were then re-docked into the same BF3 binding cavity using the electronic high- throughput screening (eHiTS) docking module (Zsoldos, Z. et al. eHiTS: a new fast, exhaustive flexible ligand docking system. J Mol Graph Model 2007, 26, 198-212). From this, 500,000 structures with eHiTS docking scores 03.0 threshold were identified. They were scored by the LigX™ module of the MOE to account for the receptor/ligand flexibility. The pKi binding affinity was scored after energy minimization to select the ligands that showed the best binding characteristics defined mainly by the energy of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The virtual hits were scored using Molecular Mechanics, the Generalized Born model and Solvent Accessibility (MM-GB/SA) method with 0PLS_2005 and GB/SA in MacroModel™ to calculate the free energies of the optimal chemical poses (Maestro, Schrodinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2008. www.schrodinger.com). The root mean square deviation (RMSD) was calculated between the Glide poses and the eHiTS poses to evaluate the docking consistency and thus to establish the most probable binding pose for a given ligand. Finally, very large and very small molecules were penalized based on a heavy atom count. With this information, a cumulative scoring of five different predicted parameters (RMSD, heavy atoms count, LigX, Macromodel, pKi) was generated where each molecule receive a binary 1.0 score for every 'top 10% appearance'. The final cumulative vote (with the maximum possible value of 5) was then used to rank the training set entries. Based on the cumulative score 5000 compounds were selected and subjected to visual inspection. After this final selection step 200 compounds were selected out of which 150 chemical substances could be readily purchased in sufficient purity and quantity.

Then, the solids were dissolved in mixture of Toluene / EtOH (4.5: 2.0, 0.11 M) and purged with vacuum/N2 one more time. Then, a solution of K2C03 (3.oeq) in H20 (1.8 M) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated overnight at 95 °C with oil bath. The reaction mixture was filtered on plug of celite. The filtrate was was poured with water and was extracted with AcOEt (x3). The organic layers were combined, washed with brine, dried over Na2S04 and evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was taken up in DCM/TFA (5: 5) for 2 h at r.t.. The solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was then neutralized with saturated NaHC03 solution and extracted with AcOEt (x2). The organic layers were washed, dried and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was precipitate in DCM or purified by automated combi- flash to afford the good compound. • 2-(iH-indol-3-yl)-4-methylquinoline VPC Number LabBook Code IC50 (eGFP) = 5.6 13 547 CA 2-69 F6-11 (yield = 62 %) IC5o (PSA) = No Data MS (ESI+) m/z = 259 1243 tR (HPLC) = 3 20 min [(M+H)+] Mp = 168-180 °C HRMS (ESI+): calculated for Cl8H15N2 m/z = 259.1230; found, 259.1237 Ή NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-de): 5 (ppm) = 11.63 (s, lH, H14), 8.90 - 8.85 (m, lH, H20), 8.32 (d, J = 2.8 Hz, lH, ¾), 8.04 - 7.98 (m, 2H, H3, 6), 7-94 (d, J = 0.9 Hz, lH, H9), 7.71 (ddd, J = 8.3, 6.9, 1.4 Hz, lH, H2), 7-53 - 7-44 (m, 2H, Hli l7), 7.24 - 7.16 (m, 2H, Hl8, 19), 2.71 (d, J = 0.8 Hz, 3H, H12).

Rapid, non-destructive, cell-based screening assays for agents that modulate growth, death, and androgen receptor activation in prostate cancer cells. Prostate 2007, 67, 416-426). Briefly, stably transfected eGFP-expressing LNCaP human prostate cancer cells (LN-ARR2PB-eGFP) containing an androgen responsive probasin-derived promoter (ARR2PB) were grown in phenol red free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% CSS. After 5 days, the cells were plated into a 96-weU plate (35,000 cells/well) with 0.1 nM of the synthetic androgen R1881 and increasing concentrations (0-100 μΜ) of compound. The cells were incubated for three days and the fluorescence was then measured (excitation 485 nm, emission 535 nm). The viability of these cells was assayed by MTS cell proliferation assay (CellTiter 961™ Aqueous One Solution Reagent, Promega™). Structure Solution and Refinement The ternary complex structure was solved by molecular replacement using the Phaser program (McCoy, A.J. et al. Phaser crystallographic software. J Appl Crystallogr 2007, 40, 658-674) and the coordinate of an apo-protein structure of AR-testosterone complex (Protein Data Bank entry 2AM9) as the search model. The structures were refined with iterative cycles of manual density fitting with COOT and refinement with Refmac (Murshudov, G.N. et al. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method. Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 1997, 53, 240-255). The extra density of testosterone was clearly observed at the initial refinement step. A characteristic electron density of the compound was observed at the BF3 binding site. Heterologous Expression of Androgen Receptor The AR ligand binding domain was expressed and purified as previously described (Estebanez-Perpina, E. et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA(2007) 104:16074 - 16079). eGFP Cellular AR Transcription Assay: AR transcriptional activity was assayed as previously described.21 Briefly, stably transfected eGFP-expressing LNCaP human prostate cancer cells (LN-ARR2PBeGFP) containing an androgen-responsive probasin-derived promoter (ARR2PB) were grown in phenol-red-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% CSS. After 5 days, the cells were plated into a 96-weU plate (35,ooocells/well) with o.inM R1881 and increasing concentrations (o-ioouM) of compound. The cells were incubated for 3 days, and the fluorescence was then measured (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 535 nm). The viability of these cells has been assayed by the MTS cell proliferation assay (CellTiter 961 Aqueous One Solution Reagent, Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Prostate Surface Antigen assay: The evaluation of PSA excreted into the media was performed in parallel to the eGFP assay using the same plates (see above description). After the cells were incubated for 3 days ΐ5θμ1 of the media was taken from each well, and added to 150 ul of PBS. PSA levels were then evaluated using Cobas e 411 analyzer instrument (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EXAMPLES Example 1 - Virtual screen for potential BF3 binders Using a previously described (Axerio-Cilies, P. et al. Inhibitors of Androgen Receptor Activation Function-2 (AF2) Site Indentified Through Virtual Screening. J Med Chem 2011 54(i8):6i97-205), consensus-based in silico methodology we conducted a virtual screen of ~io million purchasable chemical substances from the ZINC database to identify BF3- specific binders (also one NCI compound). The screening method used a combination of large-scale docking, ligand-based QSAR modeling, pharmacophore search, molecular field analysis, molecular-mechanic and molecular dynamic simulations (Cherkasov, A. et al. Progressive docking: a hybrid QSAR/docking approach for accelerating in silico high throughput screening. J Med Chem. 2006, 49, 7466-7478; Cherkasov, A. et al. 'Inductive' charges on atoms in proteins: comparative docking with the extended steroid benchmark set and discovery of a novel SHBG ligand. J Chem Inf Model 2005, 45, 1842-1853; and Santos- Filho, O.A. and Cherkasov, A. Using molecular docking, 3D-QSAR, and cluster analysis for screening structurally diverse data sets of pharmacological interest. J Chem Inf Model 2008, 48, 2054-2065). The results from each stage of this multi-parametric approach were compiled and the compounds were ranked using a consensus scoring procedure. The highest ranked compounds were visualized and initial candidates, predicted to have a high potential for binding to the BF3 pocket, were selected for empirical testing. Example 2 - Cell-based testing All compounds were screened for their ability to inhibit AR transcriptional activity using a non-destructive, cell-based eGFP screening assay (Tavassoli, P. et al. Rapid, nondestructive, cell-based screening assays for agents that modulate growth, death, and androgen receptor activation in prostate cancer cells. Prostate 2007, 67, 416-426). In this assay, the expression of eGFP is under the control of an androgen responsive probasin- derived promoter and can quantify AR transcriptional activity. From the compounds tested, 7 showed sub-μΜ IC50 values in the eGFP assay. Compounds that exhibited non-specific cellular toxicity were removed from further analysis. The most potent molecules had IC50's ranging in from 0.11 to 50uM range (TABLE 3). Some compounds were also tested in the PSA assay (TABLE 3).
