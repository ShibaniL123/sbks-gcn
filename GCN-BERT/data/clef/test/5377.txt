It is also proposed that the spring-loaded control element is arranged in a stationary guide and the control element is connected to the actuating element via a coupling element. It is also proposed that both end positions of the actuating element are designed as on and off position. In addition, it is proposed that the control is mounted in translation. Alternatively, it is provided that the control is mounted in rotation. An advantageous arrangement is that the arrangement for latching is designed as a link element in the control, in which a stationary mounted locking element such as a hook, is engaged and the locking element via a positive connection the force of the spring - first spring - receiving and the locking element on an associated spring - second spring - held in guide tracks of the sliding element and is performed depending on the direction of movement of the control element, wherein a guide rail, the blocking element supplies a stop of the sliding element and is another track to release the locking element, and that the overload cut-off the blocking element in an additional degree of freedom from the stop of the sliding element by the spring of the control against the force of the spring of the locking element is lifted out, and the additional degree of freedom of the blocking element substantially transverse to the direction of force of the spring of the control runs and the additional degree of freedom of the locking element by the switching element of the unit for torque detection is releasable. A simple construction is created in that the locking element is formed of a wire in the form of a hook having at one end an eyelet for stationary storage and have on the other hand an angled end for engaging the link element. For this purpose, it is further proposed that the blocking element in the region of the articulation having the associated spring urging the bent end in the link element. It is further provided that the electric switch as main switch of the floor care appliance is located. A further embodiment is that the on and off position is assigned a dedicated switch for circular toggle. In the drawing, an embodiment of the invention is shown schematically.

If upright a cleaner head 1 via a pivoting connecting element 3 is connected as a connection piece with an attachable filter housing 2. The cleaner head 1 has an electric drive 4 for a brush roller 5 via a drive train 6.7, while for a not-shown suction fan. In powertrain 6, 7 a unit 8 is arranged for torque detection. Here, a lever 10 is operated at a torque threshold is exceeded on a pivotable lever 9 via a trigger mechanism and operated by transmission elements 13 with a spring-loaded switching element or control element 14 an electric switch 11 for switching off the drive 4. Herein, the swingable lever 9 is triggered on an eddy current disc, the lever 9 carries a magnet. Of course, other controls of the lever arm 10 are possible. The switch 11 is also connected in parallel by an exterior actuator 12 with an on and off position at the outer part of the cleaner head 1, wherein on the spring-loaded switching element 14 and a coupling element 16, the switching position of the switch 11 when switching off above a torque threshold by overload on the actuating element 12 and transmits the A-position can be set again. The control element 14 as the control rod is arranged on a fixed slide guide 23, which is acted upon by an associated spring 15, the control element 14 is adjustable by the spring 15 toward an off position of the switch 11. The control element 14 is connected for connection with the exterior actuating element 12 via the coupling element 16 and thus the pivotally mounted actuating element 12 connected to the control 14 and an on and off position be transferred to the switch 11. To perform the above-mentioned switching movements, has the control 14 a corresponding control cam 17 for switch 11 as a rocker switch, the position of the control element 14 to the input or off of the drive 4 performs. The guided control element 14 is adjusted by the spring 15 in the off position of the main switch 11 and is connected via the coupling element 16 with the external operating member 12. The off position is limited by a locking assembly formed as a gate element 18 of the control element 14 in which a stationary mounted locking element with its angled end 20 engages in the form of a hook element 19 in the link element 18 and limited. To this end, the hook member 19 fixed for storage over an eyelet 21 and by a 22 spring loaded and held engages with its angled end 20 into a guide path of the sliding element 18. In a single location, which can be adjusted via the actuator 12, the control 14 is moved against the force of spring 15 and kept the hook member 19 on a guideway in the crank member 18 by a stop. In these shifting movements, the hook element 19 is held on the associated switching element 10 in the link element 18 with their guideways. When a safety shutdown, the switching element 10 is the guideways of the link element 18 free so that the hook member 19 jumps out of the gate element 18 and thus the control element 14 is set in an off position by the spring 15. Therefore also the actuating element is set in the off position. For uprights with a safety shutdown of the drive via a torque sensing the brush roller at overload is envisaged that a mechanical trigger element by transmission elements an electrical switch for the power switch for switching off the drive torque above a threshold operated. Here, the switch is also connected in parallel by an outboard actuator with an on and off position by a spring-loaded control and a coupling element, the throw of the switch in shutdown due to overload the actuator can be adjusted by the spring-loaded control in an off position.
