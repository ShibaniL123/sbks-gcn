EXAMPLE 10
Preparation of (S)-4-((1-(4,8-dichloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one
50 mg (0.113 mmol) of (S)-4-((1-(8-chloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one prepared in Example 5 was dissolved in 2 mL of acetic acid, to which 17 mg (0.124 mmol) of N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) was added, followed by stirring at 50Â° C. for 15 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered under reduced pressure. Saturated sodiumbicarbonate aqueous solution was added thereto, followed by neutralization. Dichloromethane and water were added thereto, followed by extraction. The extracted organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: dichloromethane/methanol, 30/1 -dichloromethane/methanol, 10/1) to give 25 mg of the target compound (S)-4-((1-(4,8-dichloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one as a pale yellow solid (0.052 mmol, yield: 46%).
