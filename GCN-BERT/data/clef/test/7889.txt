FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE This disclosure relates to systems, apparatus, and methods for documenting a code blue scenario in which a subject is undergoing resuscitation. BACKGROUND Patient safety is one of the most important challenges facing today's healthcare. There are approximately 2.5 million deaths in the U.S. each year, about a third of which occur in acute care hospitals. Unless there are “do-not-resuscitate” advanced directives in place, patients who die in a hospital most likely have undergone one or more resuscitation attempts known as “code blue.” Code blue is used by hospitals to describe a scenario in which a patient with cardiac or respiratory arrest requires stat medical intervention (i.e., resuscitation). Medical errors occur in healthcare every day. In code blue scenarios, medical errors may be likely to occur, which can cost lives. Common errors in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may include slow chest compression rates, shallow chest compression depths, hyperventilation, long pauses in CPR before shock delivery, delivery of electrical defibrillation for nonshockable rhythms, medication errors, failure to follow resuscitation guidelines (e.g., advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS), pediatric advanced life support (PALS), and/or other guidelines), and/or other errors. Studies have found conventional paper-based documentation practices of code blue scenarios may be inaccurate, often misreporting intervention delivery times, missing their delivery entirely, and/or making other documentation errors. Paper-based code blue records may commonly have missing time data, include use of multiple timepieces for recording time data during the same event, and convey a wide variation in coherence and precision of clocking devices. For example, the documentation of time in emergency events has been shown to vary significantly, by as much as nineteen minutes, depending on which clocking devices are used. Furthermore, incomplete and inaccurate documentation of code blue scenarios are frequently a source for medicolegal disputes. SUMMARY Exemplary implementations may provide complete and accurate documentation of code blue scenarios, which may facilitate quality improvement of resuscitation in practice, enhance in patent safety, and protect healthcare professionals against lawsuits. Some implementations provide an electronic apparatus for complete documentation of code blue scenarios. This apparatus may be referred to as a “BlueBox.” According to one implementation, the apparatus may include a five by ten centimeter elongated patch configured to be placed next to the mid-sternum on the left. Other configurations are contemplated. The apparatus may be configured to provide complete capture of all code blue events including vital signs of a subject (e.g., a patient or other individual undergoing resuscitation), cardiac rhythm, verbal orders, execution of the orders, chest compression, cardioversion/defibrillation, procedures, medications, labs, and/or other events. The apparatus may enhance the safety of subjects undergoing CPR. The apparatus may provide electronic code blue records that can be useful for electronic medical record (EMR) documentation, education, and quality improvement. The apparatus may include multiple sensors embedded in a micro-electronics platform. The sensors may include electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors, one or more accelerometers (e.g., a tri-axial accelerometer), a temperature sensor, an impendence sensor, one or more acoustic sensors, one or more sensors configured for detecting oxygen saturation (SpO2) (e.g., pulse oximeter sensors), and/or other sensors. In some implementations, all of the sensors may be integrated into a volume with a four centimeter diameter and eight millimeter thickness. Vital signs and audio information may be simultaneously recorded with corresponding time stamps. Security measures may be implemented to protect the recorded information. An enclosure and contact surface of the apparatus may be designed to withstand pressure from chest compressions and/or voltages from cardioversion and defibrillation. An “electronic code blue sheet” user interface may be provided to display the code blue events recorded by the apparatus. In accordance with some implementations, the user interface may be provided by an app suitable for one or more platforms including Apple iOS™ platform, Android™ platform, Microsoft Windows™, and/or other platforms. The app may retrieve information recorded by the apparatus via a wireless connection, and automatically display the code blue events chronologically with time stamps, in some implementations. The user interface may provide zoomable views of the vital signs. The user interface may facilitate playback of the audio information. In some implementations, a trained transcriptionist may annotate additional events, such as procedures and medications, based on the voice recordings. This annotation may be performed automatically with the aid of voice recognition technology, in some implementations. The electronic code blue sheet may be exported (e.g., as a portable document file (PDF) and/or other electronic document formats) so that the code blue sheet can be printed for paper medical record, or for uploading to EMR. One aspect of the disclosure relates to an apparatus configured for documenting a code blue scenario when adhered to the chest of a subject undergoing resuscitation. The apparatus may comprise an enclosure and a sensor bank. The enclosure may be configured to withstand compressive forces applied to the subject's chest during resuscitation of the subject such that components disposed within the enclosure are protected from mechanical damage. The sensor bank may be at least partially disposed within the enclosure. The sensor bank may be configured to provide signals conveying information associated with a code blue scenario. The information may include vital signs of the subject during resuscitation and audio information from an environment surrounding the subject during resuscitation. Another aspect of the disclosure relates to a system configured for documenting code blue scenarios. The system may comprise one or more physical processors configured to receive information from an apparatus configured for documenting a code blue scenario when adhered to the chest of a subject undergoing resuscitation by sensing and transmitting information associated with the code blue scenario. The information may include vital signs of the subject during resuscitation and audio information from an environment of the subject during resuscitation. The one or more physical processors may be disposed at a location other than the apparatus. The one or more processors may be further configured to execute computer program instructions. The computer program instructions may comprise a code blue documentation component configured to provide code blue documentation that conveys information related to the vital signs of the subject during resuscitation and the audio information from the environment of the subject during resuscitation. Yet another aspect of the disclosure relates to a method for documenting code blue scenarios. The method may comprise receiving, using one or more physical processors, vital sign information associated with vital signs of a subject during resuscitation in a code blue scenario. The vital sign information may be received from an apparatus configured to be adhered to the chest of the subject when the code blue scenario begins. The method may comprise receiving, using one or more physical processors, audio information from an environment surrounding the subject during resuscitation. The audio information may be received from the apparatus. The method may comprise providing, using one or more physical processors, code blue documentation that conveys information related to the resuscitation performed on the subject. The code blue documentation may be based on both the vital sign information and the audio information. These and other features, and characteristics of the present technology, as well as the methods of operation and functions of the related elements of structure and the combination of parts and economies of manufacture, will become more apparent upon consideration of the following description and the appended claims with reference to the accompanying drawings, all of which form a part of this specification, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding parts in the various figures.

FIG. 6 illustrates a method for documenting code blue scenarios, in accordance with one or more implementations. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 illustrates a system 100 configured for documenting code blue scenarios, in accordance with one or more implementations. The system 100 may provide complete documentation for code blue scenarios, which may be useful for EMR integration, medical education, quality improvement, medicolegal purposes, and/or other purposes. The system 100 may provide standardized code blue documentation that is complete and operator-independent, thus improving quality of care and protecting patient safety. According to some implementations, system 100, with its capacity to capture most or all events in code blue scenarios, may provide much needed assurance to healthcare professionals who lead code blue teams (e.g., anesthesiologists, intensivists, emergency physicians, and/or other healthcare professionals). Components of system 100 may continuously record important vital parameters of a subject undergoing CPR, procedures such as chest compression and defibrillation, and all verbal communications among the code blue team members such as orders, responses, medications, lab results, and/or other verbal communications. Proper documentation of code blue scenarios may facilitate detailed reviews of CPR events for quality improvement, thus enhancing patent safety. Proper documentation may protect healthcare professionals against lawsuits which might otherwise be due to incomplete or inaccurate documentation. Properly documenting care in a patient's medical records is essential and, in the event of a lawsuit, provides evidence that the care that was provided met professional standards. If there is no documentation, there's no evidence. In one exemplary implementation, system 100 may include an apparatus shaped as a disk having a diameter of four centimeter diameters and a thickness of one centimeter, housed in a ten by five centimeter patch shaped as a big Band-Aid. The apparatus may be configured to be placed on the left mid chest, over the fourth intercostal space between the left sternal border and left nipple, at the beginning of a code blue scenario. There may be no control buttons or other mechanisms on the apparatus. Instead, the apparatus may power on and begin recording responsive to a protective cover being removed. This may be achieved using a magnetic switch, according to some implementations. The apparatus may power off and stop recording responsive to the apparatus being removed from the subject. The apparatus may be configured to prevent unauthorized removal of any internal memory and/or tampering with recorded information. As depicted in FIG. 1, system 100 may include an apparatus 102, a personal computing platform 104, a server 106, and/or other components. The apparatus 102 may be configured for documenting a code blue scenario when adhered to the chest of a subject undergoing resuscitation.

For example, in some implementations, the position may be at a different location of the subject or covering a different shape or size area on the subject than that depicted in FIG. 2. Referring again to FIG. 1, apparatus 102 may include an enclosure 108. The enclosure 108 may be configured to withstand compressive forces applied to the subject during resuscitation such that components disposed within enclosure 108 are protected from mechanical damage (e.g., breaking or otherwise becoming unable to operate properly due to receipt of compressive forces). The enclosure 108 may be configured to withstand electrical conditions (e.g., high voltages) resulting from defibrillation being performed on the subject such that component disposed within enclosure 108 are protected from electrical and/or magnetic damage (e.g., shorting or otherwise becoming unable to operate properly due to exposure to certain electrical conditions). The enclosure 108 may have an adhesive applied to an external portion of enclosure 108 to facilitate removably adhering to the subject's chest. The apparatus 102 may be prepared with a removable cover or film (not depicted) that protects the adhesive on enclosure 108, and exposes the adhesive when removed.

At an operation 602, an indication may be received conveying that a protective cover has been removed from an apparatus (e.g., apparatus 102) configured to be adhered to the chest of a subject when the code blue scenario begins. In some implementations, operation 602 may be performed by processor(s) 116. At an operation 604, electrical power may be provided to the apparatus. Operation 604 may be performed by power supply 110, according to some implementations. According to various implementations, the electrical power may be provided responsive to the protective cover being removed and/or the apparatus being applied to the subject. At an operation 606, electronic storage (e.g., electronic storage 114) disposed within the apparatus may be queried to determine whether information associated with a code blue scenario is stored in the electronic storage. In some implementations, operation 606 may be performed by processor(s) 116. If the determination in operation 606 is positive, method 600 may proceed to an operation 608. If the determination in operation 606 is negative, method 600 may proceed to an operation 610. At operation 608, a sensor bank (e.g., sensor bank 112) disposed in the apparatus begins providing signals conveying information associated with the code blue scenario, which form a basis for code blue documentation. At an operation 612, an indication may be received conveying that the protective cover has been reapplied to the apparatus. In some implementations, operation 612 may be performed by processor(s) 116. At an operation 614, electrical power ceases to be provided to the apparatus. According to various implementations, the electrical power may cease to be provided responsive to the protective cover being reapplied to the apparatus and/or the apparatus being placed into a container. At an operation 616, the apparatus may be physically stored as a medical record. Looking back to operation 610, a determination may be made as to whether the apparatus is communicatively coupled with a personal computing platform (e.g., personal computing platform 104). In some implementations, operation 610 may be performed by processor(s) 116 in conjunction with communications interface 118. If the determination in operation 610 is negative, method 600 may proceed to operation 614. If the determination in operation in operation 610 is positive, method 600 may proceed to operation 618. At operation 618, information associated with the signals provided by the sensor bank may be transmitted from the apparatus to the personal computing platform. In some implementations, operation 618 may be performed by processor(s) 116 in conjunction with communications interface 118. At an operation 620, the personal computing platform may display a graphical user interface (e.g., graphical user interface 500) presenting code blue documentation. Operation 620 may be performed by processor(s) 144, according to some implementations. At an operation 622, user annotations may be received by the personal computing platform and implemented in the code blue documentation. Operation 622 may be performed by processor(s) 144, according to some implementations. At an operation 624, the code blue documentation may be finalized based on one or both of the information received from the apparatus and/or user annotations. Operation 624 may be performed by processor(s) 144, according to some implementations. At an operation 626, the code blue documentation may be exported in an electronic document format (e.g., PDF). Operation 626 may be performed by processor(s) 144, according to some implementations. At an operation 628, the code blue documentation may be presented for review of quality, educational purposes, and/or other purposes. Operation 628 may be performed by processor(s) 144, according to some implementations.
