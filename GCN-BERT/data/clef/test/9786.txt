FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of amorphous rosuvastatin calcium, substantially free of alkali metal impurities, via ammonium salts of rosuvastatin as intermediary compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Rosuvastatin is generic name for (+)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-(N-methyl-N-methylsulfonylamino)pyrimidin-5-yl]-(3R,5S)-dihydroxy-(E)-heptenoic acid administered in the therapy as its calcium salt as commercial drug, and illustrated in Formula 1 hereinafter, which compound is an inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase), useful in the treatment of hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Rosuvastatin and the synthesis of rosuvastatin calcium was first described in patent EP-B-521 471; in the last two steps of the whole synthesis provided by hydrolysis of methyl ester of rosuvastatin (methyl rosuvastatin) in polar solvent, e.g. ethanol, in the presence of a base, e.g. sodium hydroxide, following by isolation of sodium salt of rosuvastatin and converting said sodium salt of rosuvastatin with a water soluble calcium salt under aqueous conditions to calcium salt of rosuvastatin. The process for the preparation of the intermediates described in EP-B-521 471 patent is incorporate herein by reference. WO 2005/023778 describes a process for the preparation of rosuvastatin calcium by conversion of C1 to C4 alkyl ester of rosuvastatin, preferably tert-butyl ester of rosuvastatin with a base, preferably sodium hydroxide, in the presence of a C1 to C4 alcohol, preferably ethanol, to a solution of rosuvastatin salt, e.g. its sodium salt and converted said salt into rosuvastatin calcium by adding a source of calcium to said solution. A novel crystalline form of rosuvastatin calcium can be prepared by crystallization of amorphous form of rosuvastatin calcium from a mixture of: (i) water and acetonitrile in the ratio of 1:1 by volume; (ii) water and acetone in the ratio of 1:1 by volume; or water, methanol and methyl tert-butyl ether in the ratio of 1:1:1 by volume, what is described in WO 2000/042024. WO 01/60804 discloses certain novel amine salt with rosuvastatin, which may be prepared by addition of an appropriate amine or base to a solution of rosuvastatin acid in acetonitrile or ethyl acetate. Certain novel amine salts of rosuvastatin, preferably its crystalline methylammonium salt, may be used in the preparation of amorphous calcium salt of rosuvastatin, which process comprises sequential reaction of the crystalline methylammonium salt of rosuvastatin with sodium hydroxide, followed by a water soluble calcium salt, such as calcium chloride, under aqueous conditions. An approach is disclosed in WO 2005/051921 where rosuvastatin calcium salt is purified by conversion into isopropylammonium or cyclohexylammonium salt and back to calcium salt. It is well known that alkali metal salts of organic acids are often hygroscopic what may cause problems at isolation. Indeed the isolation of sodium salt of rosuvastatin, which can be an intermediate in preparing rosuvastatin calcium salt, might be unrepeatable in yield and physical state what depends on the reaction conditions and evaporation of solvents, which is difficult to control. International publication WO 2005/23778 tried to avoid said problems without isolating rosuvastatin sodium salt by extraction of impurities from its aqueous solution into water immiscible solvent, but by using C1 to C4 alcohols as reaction medium a risk of conversion into specific impurities still existed. Namely, it is known that β-hydroxy acids in alcoholic alkali solution are submitted to dehydration what may lead after realkoxylation into special side products (see FIG. 1, Scheme 1, wherein R and R1 independently denotes C1 to C5 alkyl group), O-alkyl derivatives of rosuvastatin, e.g. O-ethyl rosuvastatin. Therefore a need for an efficient process for preparing pure amorphous rosuvastatin calcium, without any significant amounts of side products and in having the exact stoichimetric content without other alkali metal cation, still exists. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In a general aspect of the invention there is provided a pure amorphous form of rosuvastatin calcium of Formula 1 having a purity of more than 99.5%, preferably a purity of more than 99.8%, more preferably a purity of more than 99.9% as determined by HPLC area percentage, and free from any traces of alkali metal impurities. In a first aspect the present invention provides a process for producing pure amorphous calcium salt of rosuvastatin, substantially free of alkali metal impurities, e.g. sodium cation impurity, which comprises: a) hydrolysis of C1 to C5 alkyl esters of rosuvastatin or rosuvastatin lactone with an organic nitrogen base in the presence of water, optionally containing aprotic solvent,b) converting thus obtained rosuvastatin salt of an organic nitrogen base with a source of calcium to obtain rosuvastatin calcium,c) isolating the pure amorphous calcium salt of rosuvastatin. The starting ester may be methyl ester of rosuvastatin, preferably tert-butyl ester of rosuvastatin (tert-butyl rosuvastatin). An organic nitrogen base is selected from the group consisting of guanidines, amidines, amines, quaternary ammonium hydroxides, unsubstituted or C1 to C6 alkyl substituted piperazines, morpholines, thiomorpholines, imidazolidines or adamantans. Any aprotic solvent in step a) may be used, preferably tetrahydrofuran. Any appropriate source of calcium may be used, preferably calcium chloride, calcium hydroxide, calcium acetate and calcium palmitate. The process according to the invention may be performed in a solutions of an intermediary salts of rosuvastatin with organic nitrogen bases. Said salts are novel compounds, e.g. amine salts of rosuvastatin, not described in the prior art. In another aspect of the invention rosuvastatin salts of an organic nitrogen bases may be isolated, optionally purified, e.g. by recrystallization, and used as intermediates in the preparation of the pure amorphous rosuvastatin calcium salt. The desired pure amorphous rosuvastatin calcium salt is substantially free from any traces of alkali metal salt impurities, e.g. from sodium cation, containing in intermediary rosuvastatin sodium salt obtained according to prior art processes. Further is desired pure rosuvastatin calcium free of any O-alkyl derivatives of rosuvastatin, e.g. free of O-ethyl derivative of rosuvastatin, which may be obtained as side product according to prior art processes, performed in C1 to C4 alcoholic medium. Amorphous rosuvastatin calcium prepared by the process according to the invention has at least 99.5% of chromatographic purity; moreover when using very pure starting C1 to C5 rosuvastatin ester more than 99.8% purity, even more, in some cases more than 99.9% of chromatographic purity of desired rosuvastatin calcium may be obtained. The term “chromatographic purity” means purity as determined by area percentage HPLC (“High Pressure Liquid Chromatography”). In another aspect of the invention the amorphous rosuvastatin calcium may be prepared by conversion of the novel intermediary ammonium salts of rosuvastatin with the source of calcium. Intermediary ammonium salts of rosuvastatin may be obtained by contacting rosuvastatin free acid with an appropriate amine according to the procedure which comprises: a) hydrolysis of C1 to C5 alkyl ester of rosuvastatin or rosuvastatin lactone with an alkali metal hydroxide in a mixture of an aprotic solvent and water,b) washing the reaction mixture with water immiscible solvent,c) acidifying aqueous solution of rosuvastatin alkali salt with an acid,d) extraction of the resulted aqueous solution of rosuvastatinic acid into a water immiscible organic solvent,e) adding an appropriate amine to the obtained extract containing rosuvastatinic acid to convert said rosuvastatinic acid into ammonium salt of rosuvastatin,f) converting ammonium salt of rosuvastatin with a source of calcium to obtain rosuvastatin calcium,g) isolation of amorphous rosuvastatin calcium. The water immiscible solvent used in above steps b) and d) is selected from the group consisting of C2 to C5 alkyl esters, e.g. acetate esters, preferably ethyl acetate (AcOEt), isopropyl acetate (i-Pr acetate) and iso-butyl acetate, ethers, chlorinated hydrocarbons and cyclic hydrocarbons. As acid for acidifying aqueous solution of rosuvastatin alkali salt in step c) of above process e.g. hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid may be used. The term “rosuvastatinic acid” (“rosuvastatin free acid”) means (+)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-(N-methyl-N-methylsulfonylamino)pyrimidin-5-yl]-(3R,5S)-dihydroxy-(E)-6-heptenoic acid. By using sodium hydroxide in step a) for cleavage of starting rosuvastatin esters according to above procedure purification and isolation of various isolable intermediary rosuvastatin salts with an appropriate amine may be performed after which the content of sodium cation impurity may be lowered, e.g. by washing the reaction mixture of step b) by water immiscible solvents, in the desired rosuvastatin calcium salt to less than 0.1% of sodium by weight. Some of the novel ammonium salts of rosuvastatin were prepared in well defined forms, preferably as tert-octylammonium salt of rosuvastatin, which may be isolated in highly pure crystalline form and may be valuable as analytical standard for HPLC and other analyses. The above described process of the first aspect of the invention by means of organic nitrogen bases cleavage of rosuvastatin C1 to C5 esters or lactone can be successfully applied for the preparation of other in the art known statins, preferably atorvastatin. And in final aspect of the invention provides for a pharmaceutical formulation comprising rosuvastatin calcium prepared according to above described process and a method of treatment of hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, comprising the step of administering said pharmaceutical formulation to the mammal in need thereof. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Further advantages of the invention are apparent by reference to the detailed description when considered in conjunction with the figures, wherein: FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a reaction scheme for the preparation of a rosuvastatin salt; FIG. 2 is an X-ray powder diffraction diagram for a rosuvastatin salt prepared in accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure; and FIG. 3 is an X-ray powder diffraction diagram for a rosuvastatin salt prepared in accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to find a novel process for the preparation of pure amorphous rosuvastatin calcium, substantially free of sodium cation impurities or other alkali metal cation impurities and other impurities as well, which would avoid the use of alcohols, e.g. C1 to C4 alcohols as a reaction medium and the use of alkali metal hydroxides, e.g. sodium hydroxide, thus eliminating O-alkyl rosuvastatin impurities (see FIG. 1, Scheme 1), e.g. O-ethyl rosuvastatin derivative and obtaining rosuvastatin calcium free of any traces of sodium cation impurity or alkaline metal cation impurities, which may be present as impurities in rosuvastatin calcium, prepared according to the prior art processes. Thus, the term “substantially free” means that the desired obtained amorphous rosuvastatin calcium is free of any traces of alkali metal impurities, e.g. sodium metal impurity. Further is the object of the present invention to find a novel process which would enable easy and simple preparation and optionally isolation of intermediary novel rosuvastatin salt with organic nitrogen bases, e.g. novel ammonium salts of rosuvastatin, in good quality, and which would enable simple and easy conversion of said novel intermediary compounds to desired commercial amorphous rosuvastatin calcium. We have unexpectedly and surprisingly found that above problem has been solved by hydrolysis of starting C1 to C5 alkyl esters of rosuvastatin (Formula 2) or rosuvastatin lactone (Formula 3), where instead of using C1 to C4 alcohols as protic solvent medium and strong inorganic alkali bases, e.g. sodium hydroxide, known in the prior art processes, hydrolysis take place in an aqueous solution of organic nitrogen bases. Namely, hydrolysis of starting C1 to C5 rosuvastatin esters in the presence of strong inorganic base, e.g. sodium hydroxide, according to the prior art processes, may result to incomplete conversion to desired rosuvastatin calcium. The consequence of incomplete conversion usually manifests in the presence of residual alkali metals, e.g. sodium cation, in the desired product. After using sodium hydroxide as a strong inorganic base, various amounts of residual sodium are found in the desired rosuvastatin calcium. Residual sodium cation may be removed from rosuvastatin calcium by specific method, for instance the rosuvastatin calcium salt can be retreated by vigorous stirring in aqueous suspension, preferably by ultraturrax (Ultra-Turrax® is brand name of IKA Werke GmbH & Co., Staufen, Germany for dispersion making device with high speed rotation unit). Such methods eliminate sodium in a great extent, but none of the methods completely removes sodium from the desired rosuvastatin calcium. The present invention provides the use of aqueous solution of organic nitrogen bases for cleavage of starting C1 to C5 alkyl ester of rosuvastatin or rosuvastatin lactone. Strong organic nitrogen bases selected from the group consisting of guanidines and amidines can be a method of choice. We have surprisingly found that also weak bases such as numerous amines if dissolved in water or in the mixtures of water and aprotic solvents, successfully cleft starting rosuvastatin esters if higher temperature is used. Moreover, we found out that by elevating temperature to 100° C. desired product did not neither degrade in considerable extent nor lead to appearance of corresponding amides of rosuvastatin. According to the first aspect of the invention C1-C5 alkyl esters of rosuvastatin or rosuvastatin lactone, where alkyl denotes methyl, ethyl, n-proply, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl, amyl or tert-amyl group, more preferably tert-alkyl esters, most preferably tert-butyl ester of rosuvastatin, are cleft in the solutions of organic nitrogen bases and water, optionally containing organic aprotic solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran. The organic nitrogen base used according to the process of the invention is selected from the group consisting of: a) guanidines of the formula: wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 independently denotes a hydrogen atom, a straight chain or branched chain C1-C6 alkyl group or cyclic C1-C6 alkyl group or each pair of R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 independently denotes a C1-C6 alkylene group connection which forms a ring; b) amidines of the formula: wherein each of R1, R2, R3, and R4 independently denotes a hydrogen atom, a straight chain or branched chain C1-C6 alkyl group or cyclic C1-C6 alkyl group or each pair of R1, R2, R3, and R4 independently denotes a C1-C6 alkylene group connection which forms a ring; c) amines of the formula: wherein each of R1, R2 and R3 independently denotes a hydrogen atom, a straight chain or branched chain C1-C6 alkyl group or cyclic C1-C12 alkyl group, unsubstituted or substituted on one or more C-members of the alkyl chain with a radical selected from the group consisting of hydroxy, C1-C6 alkoxy, amino, C1-C6 alkylamino, di-C1-C6 alkylamino, phenyl, pyridinyl, C1-C6 alkylamino or each pair of R1, R2 and R3 independently denotes C1-C6 alkylene connection which forms a ring; d) quaternary ammonium hydroxides of formula [in-line-formulae]NR1R2R3R4+OH−[/in-line-formulae]wherein each of R1, R2, R3 and R4 independently denotes a hydrogen atom, a straight chain or branched chain C1-C6 alkyl group or cyclic C1-C6 alkyl group or each pair of R1, R2, R3 and R4 independently denotes C1-C6 alkylene group connection which forms a ring; e) unsubstituted or C1-C6 alkyl N-substituted piperazines, morpholines, thiomorpholines, imidazolidines or adamantans. A process for preparing ammonium salts of rosuvastatin by hydrolysis of C1 to C5 alkyl esters of rosuvastatin or rosuvastatin lactone with amines of above formula in the presence of water is shown on the following Scheme 2. wherein in Formula 2 R denotes C1 to C5 alkyl group and R1, R2 and R3 denotes radicals as denoted in above formula of amines. According to the process of the invention a preferred organic nitrogen base used from the guanidine group is N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylguanidine, from the amidine group 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN) and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), from the amine group n-propylamine iso-propylamine, N-methylcyclohexylamine, dicyclohexylamine, N-methyl-iso-propylamine, N,N-di-iso-propylamine, tert-butylamine, tert-octylamine (2,4,4-trimethylpent-2-ylamine), sec-butylamine and diethylamine. According to the first aspect of the invention are starting C1 to C5 esters of rosuvastatin or rosuvastatin lactone, hydrolysed with organic nitrogen bases in the presence of water, optionally containing aprotic organic solvent (water content is more than 50% by volume, preferably more than 75% by volume). The hydrolysis is carried out at temperatures from 0° to 120° C. By said hydrolysis using strong organic nitrogen bases, e.g. guanidines and amidines is preferred temperature from 20° to 70° C., more preferred from 40° to 60°. By said hydrolysis using weak bases, e.g. amines, is the preferred temperature from 80° to 110° C., more preferred from 95° to 105° C., most preferred from 98° to 100° C. The hydrolysis of starting rosuvastatin esters according to the invention by applying volatile amines (boiling point bellow 120° C.) is carried out in tightly closed vessels at increased pressures. In another aspect of the invention a novel intermediary ammonium salts of rosuvastatin may be isolated directly from the hydrolysis mixture by evaporation to dryness, optionally following by treatment with suitable solvent to induce solidification of the corresponding salt, which is further collected, e.g. by filtration. The choice of a solvent for solidification depends on physico-chemical properties of particular salt and can be selected but not limited from nitriles, esters, ethers or hydrocarbons. For example, solid isopropylammonium salt of rosuvastatin from acetonitrile and N-methylcyclohexylammonium salt of rosuvastatin from tert-butyl methyl ether are isolated by this manner. In another aspect of the invention ammonium salts of rosuvastatin may be converted into rosuvastatin calcium salt without previous isolation of intermediary ammonium salt of rosuvastatin from the solution. Aqueous solution of rosuvastatin salt with an appropriate amine obtained after hydrolysis step is optionally washed by water immiscible solvents and further converted with calcium source to precipitate the desired pure amorphous rosuvastatin calcium. The water immiscible solvents are selected from the group consisting of esters, ethers, chlorinated hydrocarbons or cyclic hydrocarbons, preferably more user-friendly solvents, e.g. C2-C5 acetate esters, e.g. ethyl acetate or cyclic hydrocarbons. The source of calcium ion is selected from the group consisting of calcium halogenide, preferably calcium chloride, and another calcium source, e.g. calcium nitrate or calcium hydroxide, calcium salt of C1-C20 alkanoic acid, preferably calcium palmitate, calcium pivalate or calcium acetate. In an another aspect of the invention the novel intermediary ammonium salts of rosuvastatin may be prepared from rosuvastatin free acid by the reaction with an appropriate amine. The rosuvastatin free acid is prepared from a starting C1 to C5 ester of rosuvastatin or rosuvastatin lactone by reacting it with a suitable base, e.g. sodium hydroxide, in the presence of an aprotic solvent, optionally diluted with water, and subsequent addition of an acid, e.g. phosphoric acid or hydrochloric acid, to the solution of rosuvastatin sodium salt, thus obtaining rosuvastatin free acid. The strong inorganic base used in the hydrolysis step may be sodium hydroxide or other alkali metal hydroxide, and the reaction is proceeded in the presence of water or in the presence of a mixture of aprotic solvents and water, such as a mixture of water and tetrahydrofuran, optionally under increased pressure. The obtained solution of rosuvastatin alkaline salt is optionally washed by water immiscible solvents selected from the group consisting of esters, ethers, chlorinated hydrocarbons or cyclic hydrocarbons, preferably from more user-friendly solvents such as acetate esters, cyclic hydrocarbons or alkanes, more preferably from ethyl acetate. The aqueous phase containing rosuvastatin alkaline salt is subsequently treated by a strong inorganic acid, preferably by phosphoric acid or hydrochloric acid. Resulting rosuvastatinic acid (rosuvastatin free acid) is then extracted into water immiscible solvent and the obtained organic phase is converted to the ammonium salt of rosuvastatin by contacting with an appropriate amine. For the purpose of unification of water immiscible organic solvents, if said solvent is used to wash the reaction mixture, the same organic solvent may be used, for example an ester, preferably isopropyl acetate, for the reaction with an amine. In a further procedure the organic extract (above mentioned solution of rosuvastatinic acid in water immiscible solvent, e.g. isopropyl acetate) is treated with an appropriate amine to obtain the corresponding ammonium salt of rosuvastatin. Alternatively, if said salt remains dissolved it can be precipitated by an addition of an antisolvent selected from other unpolar solvents, such as esters, ethers or hydrocarbons, optionally after concentration of the solution. In another alternative, the extracting solvent can be completely removed to isolate the solid ammonium salt of rosuvastatin or if oily further treated with suitable solvent to induce solidification of the corresponding salt, which is finally collected, e.g. by filtration. The solvent for the isolation of solid ammonium salt of rosuvastatin in all these alternatives strictly depends on solubility and physical properties of particular salt, but the preferred media are C2-C5 acetate esters and ethers, most preferred iso-propyl acetate and tert-butyl methyl ether. According to this described aspect of the invention the following solid ammonium salts of rosuvastatin in good quality may be isolated: N-methylcyclohexylammonium salt (99.6% area by HPLC),cyclohexylammonium salt (99.71% area);dicyclohexylammonim salt (99.82% area);pyrrolidinium salt (99.71% area);piperidinium salt (99.77% area);morpholinium salt (99.51% area);1-adamantylammonium salt (99.75% area);tert-octylammonium salt (99.87% area). Some of the isolated solid ammonium salts of rosuvastatin are good crystalline products, and can be isolated substantially pure. A characteristic example is tert-octylammonium salt of rosuvastatin, which can be isolated in two different pseudopolymorphs and be because of its purity conveniently used as an analytical standard. From acetonitrile, optionally after washing with hexane an anhydrous crystalline form is isolated having diffraction angles in X-ray powder analysis, shown in Table 3, that is the invention is embodied in crystalline tert-octylammonium salt of rosuvastatin having X-Ray powder diffraction pattern characteristic with peaks at 8.0, 15.0, 17.7, 18.4, 18.8, 20.3, and 23.4±0, 2° 2θ and/or m.p. around 121° C. From a mixture of acetonitrile and water a crystalline monohydrate is isolated having diffraction angles in X-ray powder analysis, shown in Table 4. The invention is embodied in crystalline monohydrate of tert-octylammonium salt of rosuvastatin having X-Ray powder diffraction pattern with characteristic peaks at 8.6, 16.5, 18.6, 19.1, and 19.7±0, 2° 2 Theta. Especially recrystallized anhydrous tert-octylammonium salt of rosuvastatin has stable defined structure, therefore is more suitable for use as an analytical standard than amorphous calcium salt with its hygroscopic properties and calcium assay variation. After determination of precise contain of rosuvastatin, for example by NMR or titration, the substance can be used as weighing standard compound in HPLC analyses of rosuvastatin. The formed ammonium salts of rosuvastatin can be converted into rosuvastatin calcium salt by adding a source of calcium ions to said ammonium salt of rosuvastatin, preferably calcium acetate or calcium hydroxide, using water as a solvent. The following examples illustrate the invention, but do not limit it in any way: Analytical data in examples were achieved by the following hardware: Melting points were determined in Kofler hot stage microscope and differential dynamic calorimeter Mettler Toledo DSC822e Powder X-ray diffraction spectra of the sample was recorded on Siemens D-5000 with reflexion technique: CuKα radiation, range from 2° to 37° 2 Theta, step 0.04° 2 Theta, integration time 1 sec. The accuracy in the difractograms is believed to be ±0.2, preferably ±0.1 2 Theta.
