Step 2: 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one was dissolved in 1:1 acetonitrile/pyridine mixture (10 mL/10 mL) and excess triethylamine (4 mL) was added. The mixture was cool under ice-bath and a solution of furan-2-yl-acetyl chloride in acetonitrile (5 mL) was slowly added. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature overnight (15 hrs). The reaction was quenched with water (20 mL) and concentrated to minimum. The crude was extracted with 8:2 dichloromethane/isopropanol (2×400 mL) mixtures, washed with sat. NH4Cl (2×400 mL), and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The concentrated residue was then purified by flash chromatography over silica with CH2Cl2/MeOH (95:5). The solid was then sonicated in minimum amount of dichloromethane and the precipitated solid was collected by filtration to give 2-(furan-2-yl)-N-(4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)acetamide (0.423 g, 68%) as a beige solid.
