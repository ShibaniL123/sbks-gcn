FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to dishwashing systems, or more specifically, dishwashing conveyor systems. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Dishwashers have been in use for many years in both home and commercial use, having origins dating to the early 1800s. Dishwashers for home use typically employ a container having one or more strainer baskets for holding the dishes while one or more arms are used to spray wash and rinse solutions on the dishes. Commercial dishwashers may have an alternate design using a linear conveyor system that conveys dishes through a series of spray headers directing high temperature wash and rinse solutions towards the dishes. These conveyor designs typically occupy much more area than a home model, however, deeming them impractical for home use. The present invention features a compact portable dishwasher conveyor system for automatically cleaning dishes. Any feature or combination of features described herein are included within the scope of the present invention provided that the features included in any such combination are not mutually inconsistent as will be apparent from the context, this specification, and the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art. Additional advantages and aspects of the present invention are apparent in the following detailed description and claims. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention features a portable dishwasher conveyor system for automatically cleaning dishes comprising a horizontal counter top with a sink located therein. In some embodiments, the system comprises a conveyor frame located on the counter top. In some embodiments, the system comprises a continuous conveyor belt located over a plurality of rollers on the conveyor frame. In some embodiments, a plurality of drag bars is sequentially located on a belt exterior surface. In some embodiments, the system comprises a motor located on the conveyor frame having an externally toothed drive gear located on a rotating motor shaft for powering the conveyor belt. In some embodiments, the system comprises a pair of “U” shaped spray bars located on the conveyor frame. In some embodiments, the spray bars comprise a plurality of spray bar nozzles located on each spray bar inside surface thereon. In some embodiments, the spray bars are located at a bar angle from one another. In some embodiments, the system comprises a transparent cover located on the conveyor frame. In some embodiments, the system comprises an adjustable conveyor member located on a frame posterior end adapted to angularly adjust to a downward slope for conveying dishes into the sink.
