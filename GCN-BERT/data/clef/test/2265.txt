Method A: Achiral Synthesis, followed by chiral separation The achiral synthesis of N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-l-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-l-sulfonamide has been described previously, (see US published patent application US 2008/0058340 Al), and is summarized below in scheme 1. The product is obtained as a racemic mixture of the (R) and (S) enantiomers, which are separated via chiral HPLC. BHC 093080 FC-Text Scheme 1: Achiral synthesis ofN-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-l-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-1 -sulfonamide Method Β: Synthesis from chiral starting materials [0030] Schemes 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a show synthetic routes by which (R)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-1 -(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-1 -sulfonamide could be prepared, and are discussed below. [0031] Schemes 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b and 6b show synthetic routes by which (S)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-1 -(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-1 -sulfonamide could be prepared, and are discussed below. BHC 093080 FC-Text [0032] Method Β, Route I: A cyclopropyl group is introduced across the alkene of diol-protected 4-iodopent-4-ene-l,2-diol, to form the protected 3-(l-iodocyclopropyl)propane-l,2-diol derivative, which is then sulfonylated. Coupling with 5,6-difluoro-A'-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenyl)-3-methoxybenzene-1,2-diamine and final deprotection yields (R)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-l-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-l-sulfonamide, (S)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-l-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-l-sulfonamide or the racemic mixture, depending on the starting material employed. [0033] Method Β, Route II: In a slightly different approach to route A above, the cyclopropanation reaction may be affected after coupling with the diaryl amine. Diol protected 4-iodopent-4-ene-l,2-diol is converted to the sulfonyl chloride and then coupled with 5,6-difluoro-A/'-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenyl)-3-methoxybenzene-l,2-diamine. The amine functionalities are protected, as necessary, the alkene converted to the cyclopropyl group and finally any remaining protecting groups removed as required to yield (R)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-l-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-l-sulfonamide, (S)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-l-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-l-sulfonamide or the racemic mixture, depending on the starting material employed. [0034] Both of these routes require as starting material, a diol-protected 4-iodopent-4-ene-l,2-diol, which may be prepared according to the following scheme: Scheme 3α: (R)-diol-protected 4-iodopent-4-ene-l,2-diol lodination HO, HO Scheme 3b: (S)-diol-protected4-iodopent-4-ene-l,2-diol [0035] Starting material, glycidol is available commercially as the (R) enantiomer, the (S) enantiomer or the (R/S)-(+/-)- mixture. The alcohol can be protected, for example by reaction with ‘butyldimethylsilyl chloride, or other suitable protecting group. Alternatively, the TBS protected glycidol is available commercially as the (R) enantiomer, the (S) enantiomer or the (R/S)-(+/-)-racemic mixture. Coupling with a protected acetylene, followed by deprotection and iodination with a reagent such as 9-iodo-9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-I-BBN), provides 4-iodopent-4-ene-l,2-diol, which is then diol-protected. Note that although there is no inversion of stereochemistry during this synthesis, starting with (R)-(+)-glycidol will result in the formation of (S)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-BHC 093080_FC-Text 4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-l-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-l-sulfonamide; starting with (S)-()-glycidol will result in the formation of (R)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-1 -(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-1 -sulfonamide. [0036] Method Β, Diol protected l-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-l-sulfonyl chloride: In some embodiments, the diol protected l-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-l-sulfonyl chloride intermediate is used. 1,2 Diol protecting groups are well known in the art such as, though not limited to 1,3-dioxolane, 2-methyl-l,3-dioxolane, 2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolane, 2-'butyl-1,3-dioxolane, 2-phenyl-l,3-dioxolane, 1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]decane, di-para-methoxybenzyloxymethyl ether, di-'butyldimethylsilyl ether, and the like: ηο-.·Α HO' 1,2 Diol Protecting Groups rx f A γυΤ "7' < 0-^ ' O '-' ΡΜΒΜ-0-^ A \ ο..,Α ρ,.Λ .ο,Λ .ο,.Λ λ-ο-..Α TBDMS-0..A TBDMS-O^ HO HO 1,2 Diol Protecting Groups >=C> TBDMS-0 TBDMS-0 [0037] Synthetic schemes for the preparation of 1 -((2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl)cyclopropane-1 sulfonyl chloride are provided below: Route i: BH3xSMe2 ΗΟ,, ,/s^OEt J ° PyH+ OTs' \ OMe 'OMe i) 'BuLi, Et2G ► ll) \ 0,,./Ν/δθ2℮1 V* BH3xSMe2 Pyl-T OTs' jnr ν OMe 'OMe i) ‘BuLi, Et20 ii) SO2OI2 \ 0^^S02CI )C^ Ρ-., OEt [>Ti(OiPr)2 [>Ti(OiPr)2 Br2 / PPh3 Pyridine, DCM Br2 / PPh3 Pyridine, DCM BHC 093080 FC-Text Route ii: HO/,./x^OEt i) Reduce PPh3, Im, l2 y Οΐ,./Ν/1 Na2S03 v p„ (/ss/S03Na Protect ΑΑ DCM ΑΑ EtOH HO,,.^-s^OEt i) I ΕΚΤ¾ ° '•) Br\,SiMe3 O. if HO' i) Br2 X ΡΜ℮ NMe2CH2l i) ‘BuLi Mg HO' ΗΟ/. _^\^SiMe3 ϋ)№ΟΜ℮ ΗΟ,.

Conversion of the sulfonate to the sulfonyl chloride provides the sulfonyl chloride derivative, l-(2-hydroxy-3-protected-hydoxypropyl)cyclopropane-l-sulfonyl chloride, which is then coupled with 5,6-difluoro-/V'-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenyl)-3-methoxybenzene-l,2-diamine. Removal of any residual protecting groups, as required, yields (R)N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-l-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-l- sulfonamide, (S)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-l-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-l-sulfonamide or the racemic mixture, depending on the starting material employed.

The amine groups are protected as required, using suitable protecting groups, such as, but not limited to propyl, di-propyl, para-methoxybenzyl, di- para-methoxybenzyl, cyclic groups, and the like: BHC 093080_FC-Text [0040] Amine protected /V-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)cyclopropanesulfonamide is coupled with protected glycidol, which after final removal of protecting groups, as required, yields (R)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-l(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-l-sulfonamide, (S)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-l-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-l-sulfonamide or the racemic mixture, depending on the glycidol employed.

The alcohol can be protected, for example by reaction with ‘butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBS-C1), or other suitable protecting group. Alternatively, the TBS protected glycidol is available commercially as the (R) enantiomer, the (S) enantiomer or the (R/S)-(+/-)-racemic mixture. Coupling with a protected acetylene, (≡-Ρϋ2) followed by deprotection and iodination with a reagent such as 9-iodo-9-borabicyclo[3.3. l]nonane (9-1-ΒΒΝ), provides 4-iodopent-4-ene-l,2-diol, which is then diol-protected. A cyclopropyl group is introduced across the alkene of diol-protected 4-iodopent-4-ene-l,2-diol, to form the protected 3-(l-iodocyclopropyl)propane-l,2-diol derivative, which is then sulfonylated. Note that although there is no inversion of stereochemistry, starting with (R)-(+)-glycidol will result in the formation of (S)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-l-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-l-sulfonamide; starting with (S)-(-)-glycidol will result in the formation of (R)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-l-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane-l-sulfonamide.

Alternatively, the disulfane can be reduced to the sulfide, which is then oxidized to the sulfonate and converted to the sulfonyl chloride (route ϋ-℮): II. PROTECTING GROUPS [0052] In the reactions described, it may be necessary to protect reactive alcohol and/or amine functional groups. Protecting groups are used to block some or all alcohol and/or amine functional groups to prevent them from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. In some embodiments, wherein more than one protective group is required, each protective group is removable by a different means. In other embodiments, wherein more than one protective group is required, multiple protective groups are removable by BHC 093080 FC-Text the same means. In some embodiments, wherein more than one protective group is required, a single protecting group maybe used to protect multiple functionalities (eg a cyclic group). Protective groups can be removed by treatment with acid, base, a nucleophile, hydrogenolysis or by exposure to UV light or a combination thereof. For example, groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and /-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile; groups such as methyl, ethyl and acetyl are base labile and groups such as /-butyl carbamate and benzyl are hydrolytically removed. Another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react. Other protecting groups, plus descriptions of techniques applicable for adding and removing protecting groups are described in "Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis" by Greene & Wuts, 3rd edition, 1999, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY, incorporated herein by reference. [0053] In some embodiments, intermediates comprising a protected alcohol are required. Alcohol protecting groups are well known to those of skill in the art of organic chemistry, and are well described in the literature (see for example "Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis" by Greene & Wuts, 3rd edition, 1999, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY; Chapter 2 - "Protection for the Hydroxyl Group, Including l,2-andl,3-Diols"). Examples of alcohol protecting groups include, but are not limited to substituted methyl ethers, such as methoxymethyl, benzyloxymethyl, p-methoxybenzyloxymethyl, /-butoxymethyl, tetrahydropyranyl, methoxycyclohexyl, methoxytetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrofuranyl; substituted ethyl ethers, such as ethoxyethyl, /-butyl, allyl, propargyl; substituted benzyl ethers such as p-methoxybenzyl, picolyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl; silylethers, such as trimethylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl, /-butyldimethylsilyl, tribenzylsilyl, triphenylsilyl; esters, carbonates, sulfonates and the like. [0054] In some embodiments, intermediates comprising protected 1,2-diols are required. 1,2-Diol protecting groups are well known to those of skill in the art of organic chemistry. Examples of 1,2-diol protecting groups include, but are not limited to 1,3-dioxolane, 2-methyl-l,3-dioxolane, 2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolane, 2-'butyl-l,3-dioxolane, 2-phenyl-l,3-dioxolane, l,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]decane, di-para-methoxybenzyloxymethyl ether, di'butyldimethylsilyl ether, and the like: 1,2 Diol Protecting HO Groups ΡΜΒΜ-0/..
