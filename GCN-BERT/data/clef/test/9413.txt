FIELD Embodiments of the invention relate generally to systems, devices, and methods for treating tremor, and more specifically relate to system, devices, and methods for treating tremor by stimulation of a peripheral nerve. BACKGROUND Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder, affecting an estimated 10 million patients in the U.S., with growing numbers due to the aging population. The prevalence of ET rises with age, increasing from 6.3% of the population over 65, to above 20% in the population over 95. ET is characterized by an involuntary oscillatory movement, typically between 4-12 Hz. It can produce oscillations in the voice and unwanted movements of the head and limbs. Tremor in the hands and forearm is especially prevalent and problematic because it makes it difficult to write, type, eat, and drink. Unlike Parkinson's tremor, which exists at rest, essential tremor is postural and kinetic, meaning tremor is induced by holding a limb against gravity or during movement, respectively. Disability with ET is variable, and ranges from embarrassment to the inability to live independently when tasks such as writing and self-feeding are not possible due to the uncontrolled movements of the hand and arm. Despite the high prevalence and high disability in many patients with ET, there are insufficient treatment options to address tremor. The drugs used to treat tremor (e.g., Propanolol and Primidone) have been found to be effective in reducing tremor amplitude by only 50% in only 60% of patients. These drugs have side effects that can be severe and are not tolerated by many patients with ET. An alternative treatment is surgical implantation of a stimulator within the brain using deep brain stimulation (DBS), which can be effective in reducing tremor amplitude by 90%, but is a highly invasive surgical procedure that carries significant risks and cannot be tolerated by many ET patients. Thus, there is a great need for alternative treatments for ET patients that reduce tremors without the side effects of drugs and without the risks of brain surgery. Tremor is also a significant problem for patients with orthostatic tremor, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's Disease. A variety of neurological disorders include tremor such as stroke, alcoholism, alcohol withdrawal, peripheral neuropathy, Wilson's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome and fragile X syndrome, as well as brain tumors, low blood sugar, hyperthyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, insulinoma, normal aging, and traumatic brain injury. Stuttering or stammering may also be a form of tremor. The underlying etiology of tremor in these conditions may differ from ET; however, treatment options for some of these conditions are also limited and alternative treatments are needed. ET is thought to be caused by abnormalities in the circuit dynamics associated with movement production and control. Previous work has shown that these circuit dynamics may be temporarily altered by cooling, topical analgesics and vibration. Previous work reported that electrical stimulation using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) did not improve tremor (Munhoz 2003). It was therefore surprising to discover in our clinical study that circuit dynamics associated with ET can be altered by peripheral nerve simulation resulting in a substantial reduction in the tremor of individuals with ET. The present invention is a novel peripheral stimulation device to send signals along the sensory nerves to the central nervous system in order to modify the abnormal network dynamics. Over time, this stimulation normalizes the neural firing in the abnormal network and reduces tremor. While DBS stimulates the brain directly, our peripheral stimulation influences the abnormal brain circuit dynamics by sending signals along the sensory nerves that connect the periphery to the brain. This approach is non-invasive and expected to avoid DBS's surgical risks and associated problems with cognitive, declarative and spatial memory dysarthria, ataxia or gait disturbances. The peripheral nerve stimulation may effectively treat tremors by dephasing, overriding or obscuring the abnormal brain circuit dynamics. Overriding, obscuring or training the brain to ignore the abnormal brain circuit dynamics follows on hypotheses for the mechanisms of traditional DBS. Perhaps the technology most closely related to our approach is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). High-frequency TENS (50 to 250 Hz) is commonly used to treat pain, with the hypothesis that excitation of large, myelinated peripheral proprioceptive fibers (A-beta) blocks incoming pain signals. While the inconsistent clinical results achieved using TENS for pain control have led many to question its use for treatment of pain, it is well documented that surface electrical stimulation excites A-beta neurons. A-beta neurons communicate proprioceptive sensory information into the same brain circuits that are abnormal in diseases including ET and Parkinson's disease. Without being limited by any proposed mechanism of action, this has led us to propose that neurostimulation could be used to excite A-beta nerves and thereby improve tremor. This proposal is particularly surprising because a previous study by Munhoz et al. failed to find any significant improvement in any of the tremor parameters tested after application of TENS. See Munhoz et al., Acute Effect of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation on Tremor, Movement Disorders, 18(2), 191-194 (2003).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Definition of Terms As used herein, the terms “stimulating” and “stimulator” generally refer to delivery of a signal, stimulus, or impulse to neural tissue of the targeted region. The effect of such stimulation on neuronal activity is termed “modulation;” however, for simplicity, the terms “stimulating” and “modulating,” and variants thereof, are sometimes used interchangeably herein. The effect of delivery of the signal to the neural tissue may be excitatory or inhibitory and may potentiate acute and/or long-term changes in neuronal activity. For example, the effect of “stimulating” or “modulating” a neural tissue may comprise one or more of the following effects: (a) depolarizing the neurons such that the neurons fire action potentials, (b) hyperpolarizing the neurons to inhibit action potentials, (c) depleting neurons ion stores to inhibit firing action potentials (d) altering with proprioceptive input, (e) influencing muscle contractions, (f) affecting changes in neurotransmitter release or uptake, or (g) inhibiting firing. “Proprioception” refers to one's sensation of the relative position of one's own body parts or the effort being employed to move one's body part. Proprioception may otherwise be referred to as somatosensory, kinesthetic or haptic sensation. A “proprioceptor” is a receptor providing proprioceptive information to the nervous system and includes stretch receptors in muscles, joints, ligaments, and tendons as well as receptors for pressure, temperature, light and sound. An “effector” is the mechanism by which the device modulates the target nerve. For example, the “effector” may be electrical stimulation of the nerve or mechanical stimulation of proprioceptors. “Electrical stimulation” refers to the application of electrical signals to the soft-tissue and nerves of the targeted area. “Vibrotactile stimulation” refers to excitation of the proprioceptors, as by application of a biomechanical load to the soft-tissue and nerves of the targeted area. Applying “thermal stimulation” refers to induced cooling or heating of the targeted area. Applying “chemical stimulation” refers to delivery of either chemical, drug or pharmaceutical agents capable of stimulating neuronal activity in a nerve or in neural tissue exposed to such agent. This includes local anesthetic agents that affect neurotransmitter release or uptake in neurons, electrically excitable cells that process and transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. The “cloud” refers to a network of computers communication using real-time protocols such as the internet to analyze, display and interact with data across distributed devices. Clinical Study We evaluated the method of using peripheral nerve stimulation to alter the circuit dynamics associated with ET in a clinical study. A device 100 that delivers transcutaneous electrical nerve simulation (TENS) using surface electrodes 102 positioned on the palmar side of the wrist was used to stimulate the median nerve 104 with square waves at a frequency of 150 Hz with a pulse width of 300 microseconds for 40 minutes, as illustrated in FIG. 1. Wires 106 were used in this embodiment to connect the device 100 to the electrodes 102. It was surprising to discover that the tremor was reduced because previous work reported that peripheral nerve stimulation using TENS did not improve tremor (Munhoz 2003, referenced above). This electrical stimulation effectively reduced the tremor in subjects with tremors ranging in severity from mild to severe. Kinetic tremors were evaluated using a widely used measure of kinetic tremor: the Archimedes Spiral drawing task of the Fahn Tolosa Marin test. Postural tremors were evaluated by measuring the angular velocity of gyroscopes worn on the back on the hand. Three patients, represented as subject A, B and C in FIG. 2, show spirals drawn by subjects with mild, moderate and severe ET before and after stimulation. The postural tremor reductions were 70%, 78% and 92%, respectively, in the subjects with mild, moderate and severe tremor. Postural tremor could also be reduced with electrical stimulation, and this effect was maintained up to 45 minutes after the end of treatment. FIGS. 3A-3C shows the effect on wrist flexion-extension as determined from gyroscopic data in subject B from FIG. 2 as a representative example. Fifteen minutes of treatment reduced the tremor amplitude from 0.9 degrees (FIG. 3A) to 0.2 degrees (FIG. 3B). This reduction in tremor amplitude was maintained through 40 minutes of treatment. A measurement taken 20 minutes after treatment showed the tremor amplitude continued to be reduced and was maintained at 0.2 degrees (FIG. 3C). The tremor reduction was variable between subjects. Some subjects did not respond to therapy, as shown in FIG. 4. Great therapeutic results were achieved by reducing the tremor in subjects with ET through the application of electrical stimulation. The stimulation was able to reduce tremor during the treatment, immediately after the treatment, and up to twenty minutes after treatment. To enable chronic use and allow patients with ET to integrate the treatment into their lives, it is important to make the system convenient to use and effective over a long duration. The following innovations and devices achieve this goal. Device Location The device stimulates the sensory nerves in order to modify the abnormal network dynamics. Over time, this stimulation normalizes the neural firing in the abnormal network and reduces tremor. Preferentially, the stimulated nerve is a nerve that carries sensory proprioceptive information from the limb affected by the tremor. The nerve may be modulated directly, such as by electrical stimulation anywhere along or adjacent to a nerve carrying proprioceptive information. Alternatively, the target nerve may be modulated indirectly, such as by excitation of the proprioceptors that stimulate the target nerve. FIG. 5 shows access points to nerves carrying proprioceptive information from a limb or vocal cords or larynx. These access points can include, but are not limited to, the fingers (510), the hand (520), the wrist (530), the lower arm (540), the elbow (550), the upper arm (560), the shoulder (570), the spine (580) or the neck (590), foot, ankle, lower leg, knee, or upper leg. Nerves affecting proprioception can include, for example, the median, ulnar, radial, or other nerves in the hand, arm, and spinal area, or along muscle or within joints. These regions target to the nerves may include the brachial plexus, medial nerves, radial nerves, and ulnar, dermal, or joint space nerves. These regions may also target the musculature including muscles of the shoulder, muscles of the arm, and muscles of the forearm, hand, or fingers. Muscles of the shoulder may include, by non-limiting example, the deltoid, teres major and supraspinatus. Muscles of the arm may include the coracobrachialis and triceps brachii. Muscles of the forearm may include the extensor carpi radialis longus, abductor pollicis longus, extensor carpi unlarnis, and flexor carpi ulnaris. In a preferred location, the device interfaces with the dermal surface of the tremulous upper extremities of the user and applies neuromodulatory signals to the nerve bundles selected from the group consisting of the brachial plexus, medial nerves, radial nerves, and ulnar nerves or the excitable structures in the musculature of the upper extremities on the skin or within a joint. Proprioceptors can be found for example in muscles, tendons, joints, skin, and the inner ear. Criteria defining candidate nerves for direct modulation include the location of the tremor to be reduced and the proximity of the nerve to the skin's surface, high density of proprioceptive fibers, and distance from excitable pain receptors or muscles. The median nerve targeted at the wrist and the ulnar nerve targeted at the elbow rank high by these criteria. Criteria defining candidate location for indirect proprioceptive modulation include the density and type of proprioceptors. Pacinian corpuscles provide information about touch; Muscle spindles provide information about changes in muscle length by triggering action potentials in the muscle spindle afferent nerve when mechanically-gated ion channels open due to muscle stretching; Golgi tendon organs provide information about muscle tension. These structures may also be stimulated to alter circuit dynamics and reduce tremor. The device targets the specific nerves that synapse on the abnormal brain circuit. This synapse may be either direct, or through multiple relay synapses. FIGS. 6A and 6B shows a set of representative nerves that transmit proprioceptive information into the olivo-cerebello network, a network that is abnormal in ET. These nerves include the (610) distal branches and main branches of the (620) median nerve and (630) ulnar nerve, as well as the (640) distal branches and main branches of the (650) radial nerve. In preferred embodiments, this device targets the nerves inputting proprioceptive information from the hand, wrist and forearm. In another embodiment, the combination of any parts described here within, may be used to affect the nerves associated with voice tremor, including but not limited to branches of the vagus nerve such as the superior laryngeal nerve or the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Device Components: Various Embodiments FIGS. 7A-7D are conceptual diagrams illustrating some embodiments of a tremor altering system 700. System 700 includes a housing 720, one or more effectors 730, one or more controls 740 in electrical communication with the effector 730, and one or more power sources 750. The housing 720 can, in some embodiments, include an interface 760. The interface facilitates the coupling of the effector to the patient. For example, the interface can provide a physical, electrical, chemical, thermal or magnetic connection between the device and the patient's nerve. The housing 720 can also, in some embodiments, include a sensor 780 to detect the tremor, memory 770, display 790, and processor 797. The device in this embodiment may include a processor 797 coupled to the effector which could perform computations and control of other components. The device may also include a digital library stored on the processor 797 or memory 770 which could contain preloaded modulation protocols. The device could include a controls module 740 that communicates with the processor 797 and could be used by the user to control stimulation parameters. The controls allow the user to adjust the operation of the device. For example, the controls can be configured to turn the device on, turn the device off, adjust a parameter of the effector, such as the intensity. The device may include a sensor 780 connected to the processor 797 which may detect information of predefined parameters and transmits said parameter information to the processor 797. The device may include a data storage unit 770 connected to the sensor 780 and processor 797; and a power supply 750 may be connected to the processor. The device may further contain a display or indicators 790 to communicate with the user and report on the status of the device. Indicators are preferably a light-emitting diode (LED) or some visual indicator but can alternatively be an audio indicator. The information may include the battery power or the stimulation status. The device might not have an Effector 730. It may be a diagnostic non-therapeutic device. In a preferred embodiment, the Interface Unit 704 would be worn on the tremoring limb to track the tremor over time. Providing feedback to the user of the device can make them aware of their tremor and allow monitoring over time. Even without therapeutic stimulation this biofeedback can help some individuals reduce their tremor. Alternatively, the device might not have a Sensor 780. It may be a therapeutic non-diagnostic device. In order to make the device small and simple, many of these components could be housed in a separate unit. Processing, controlling and possibly sensing may be done remotely in a Decision Unit 702, making the Interface Unit 704 that provides the therapeutic contact with the patient compact, simple, and flexible for a variety of applications (FIGS. 7B-7D). This Decision Unit 702 may be a new device designed for this application, or it may be integrated into an existing technology such as a smartphone. This would allow the system to be robust handheld form-factor with a reduced cost and size. In a preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 7B, the Interface Unit 704 is an implant; the Effector 730 provides electrical stimulation of the nerves; the instruction set and power are transmitted wirelessly from an external device. Alternatively, the implanted Interface Unit 704 may be powered with an on-board battery. Alternatively, the implanted Interface Unit 704 may contain a sensor 780 for direct detection of the tremor or neuromuscular activity detected by electroneurography (ENG) or electromyography (EMG). In the preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 7C, the Interface Unit 704 is worn on the surface of the body; the Effector 730 provides electrical stimulation of the underlying nerves or vibrotactile stimulation of nearby proprioceptors. The sensor 780 could include motion sensors including accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers. In the preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 7D, one or more sensor units 780, sensing motion, temperature, etc. may be worn at different locations in the body. The effector 730 and decision unit 702 are a separate entity worn at a different location on the body than the sensors 780. This is useful if stimulation of a nerve occurs in a location where tremor is not as easily or accurately measured. For instance, a stimulation device 700 placed on the underside of the wrist for reducing hand tremor is highly effective. However, measuring tremor of the hand from the wrist using accelerometer or gyroscopes could prove more difficult; a sensor unit placed separately on the palm or backside of the hand in a glove or worn as a ring on one of the digits would show greater sensitivity towards hand tremor since it is located beyond wrist joint. Effectors: General The effector may function to modulate the neural tissue in the upper extremity region at which stimulation is directed. For example, the effector can modify neuronal signals in the nerves and/or modify the flow or content of proprioceptive information. The effectors may be delivered transcutaneously or subcutaneously. One or more effectors can be used to influence the nerves. In some embodiments, the effector can be excitatory to the nerve. In other embodiments, the effector can be inhibitory to the nerve. In some embodiments, the system can be used to excite the nerve during some portions of the treatment and inhibit the nerve during other portions of the treatment. Effector: Electrical Stimulation In some embodiments, the effector may be an electrical stimulator. Electrical effectors can include an electrode, an electrode pair, an array of electrodes or any device capable of delivering an electrical stimulation to a desired location. Electrical stimulation may be transcutaneous or subcutaneous. For example, transcutaneous electrical stimulation may be achieved with electrodes placed on the surface of the skin while subcutaneous electrical stimulation may be achieved with an implanted electrode positioned close to a nerve. The stimulation parameters may be adjusted automatically, or controlled by the user. The stimulation parameters may include on/off, time duration, intensity, pulse rate, pulse width, waveform shape, and the ramp of pulse on and off. In one preferred embodiment the pulse rate may be approximately 50 to 5000 Hz, and a preferred frequency of about 50Hz to 300 Hz, or 150 Hz. A preferred pulse width may range from 50 to 500 μs (micro-seconds), and a preferred pulse width may be approximately 300 μs. The intensity of the electrical stimulation may vary from 0 mA to 500 mA, and a preferred current may be approximately 1 to 6 mA. These preferred settings are derived from the clinical study described above that provided a valuable reduction in tremor sustained for a time period. We note that the electrical stimulation can be adjusted in different patients and with different methods of electrical stimulation; thus, these preferred settings are non-limiting examples. The increment of intensity adjustment may be 0.1 mA to 1.0 mA. In one preferred embodiment the stimulation may last for approximately 10 minutes to 1 hour. In one preferred embodiment, the electrodes may be in contact with the user at the surface of the skin above one or more nerve(s) that may include the medial, radial, and ulnar nerves. The electrode may be in the configuration where there is an electrode pair, in which one electrode is proximal (closer to the elbow) and another is distal (closer to the hand). The electrodes may be in communication with the opposing electrode. The electrode pair may have a polarity of positive or negative charge in which electrical current passes. The effector may include two electrodes, each with positive or negative polarity, or an electrode array may include multiple electrode pairs, where each pair is independently programmed or programmed dependently in relation to the other pairs of electrodes. As an example, the program can allow cyclic stimulation of different nerves at different times, such as ulnar, then median, then radial, or any combination thereof. Electrical stimulation may be designed to suppress tremors by interfering with proprioceptive input, inducing compensatory muscle contractions, or by a combination of both methods. The electrodes may be substituted by any equivalent material capable of conducting electrical signals through the stimulator interface with the dermal surface of the upper extremity. The electrodes may be attached to a control unit 740 which could apply electrical stimulation via the electrodes to the soft tissue and nerves in the region where the electrode are placed and the region immediately surrounding. In another variation of the embodiment, several electrodes can be placed to a combination of targeted regions. A function generator connected to and controlled by the processor may function to modulate electrical stimulation parameters. The function generator is preferably an arbitrary waveform generator that uses direct digital synthesis techniques to generate any waveform that can be described by a table of amplitudes. The parameters are selected from a group including but not limited to frequency, intensity, pulse width or pulse duration, and overall duration. The outputs preferably have a power limit set by the maximum output voltage. In a preferred embodiment, the digitally stored protocols cycle through various stimulation parameters to prevent patient acclimation. Variation of electrical stimulation is achieved by the function generator. Optimizing Stimulation: Dephasing In a preferred embodiment, the stimulation is designed to dephase synchronicity in the brain. The concept of dephasing the abnormal circuit follows on recent work showing neural retraining reduces the network's propensity to fall into an abnormal rhythm. Interestingly, movement disorders are often associated with abnormal periodic synchronous firing in brain circuits. In Parkinson's disease, this circuit is in the basal ganglia. In ET, it is the olivo-cerebellar circuit. These anomalous oscillations are thought to drive the tremor, as supported by numerous studies showing that the tremor observed in the hand and forearm muscles is synched with pathological rhythmic discharges in the brain. Recent DBS studies have shown that low-voltage phase-shifted bursts on adjacent pairs of electrodes (called Coordinated Reset) can reduce synchronization in abnormal brain networks and that this reduces Parkinsonian tremors. The application of Coordinated Reset theory to treat tinnitus supports the concept of using synaptic excitation to retrain neural networks. The device disclosed herein offers several advantages over high-frequency TENS stimulation, including using lower power (leading to extended battery life, less discomfort from motor recruitment and contraction, less discomfort from sensory excitation), less suppression of firing in activity in adjacent nerves (by depletion or other mechanisms), and maintaining longer-lasting effects such that the device only need be used intermittently to train or maintain training of the neural circuit dynamics. The device stimulates sets of nerves in such a way that it targets neural subpopulations to reduce synchronization of the population. For example, this may be achieved by stimulating different fingers on the hand. FIG. 8A is a diagram showing a preferred embodiment of the device, in which (810) anode and (820) cathode electrode pairs on the fingers are used to excite the branches of the proprioceptive nerves (the median, radial and ulnar nerves) in each finger. This arrangement of anode (distal) and cathode (proximal) is designed to induce a nerve pulse traveling towards the brain. The unique stimulation pattern on each finger will send a unique signal to a specific subpopulation of neurons in the brain because of the somatotopic organization of the brain, in which signals from different adjacent or nearby body parts synapse at nearby locations in the brain. In an alternative embodiment, the anode and cathode position may be reversed to inhibit the passage of sensory impulses towards the brain (antidromic collision). FIG. 8B shows an alternate arrangement, in which there is only a (830) single electrode on the finger and the (840) second electrode is positioned on the wrist. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the fingers represent only one possible set of targets and different locations may similarly be used target adjacent subpopulations of neurons. In the alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 8C, the electrodes are positioned on different locations on the wrist to target the (850) median, (860) ulnar and (870) radian nerves. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the input may also be positioned on other locations or branches of the nerves that input into the abnormal brain circuit. The location may be on the same or opposite side of the limb with tremors. The location may be on the surface of the skin, crossing the skin, or implanted. FIG. 8D illustrates various stimulation sites which can be subjected to stimulation that is delayed or offset by a predetermined fraction or multiple of the tremor period, T, as shown for example in FIG. 9. The device uses stimulation schemes designed to dephase, override or obscure the abnormal network. FIG. 9A is a conceptual diagram showing a sample excitation scheme to dephase brain regions receiving sensory input from two sites. For example, the two sites could be two of the fingers shown in FIGS. 8A-8D. The stimulation at site 2 is delayed after site 1 by time T/2, where T is the period of the native tremor. For example, if the tremor is at 8 Hz the period is 125 ms and the stimulation of site 2 would be delayed by 62.5 ms. The stimulation is designed to reset the phase of the neuron, which may be implemented using high frequency stimulation (above 100 Hz) or a DC pulse. FIG. 9B is a conceptual diagram showing a sample excitation scheme to dephase brain regions receiving sensory input from four sites, with subsequent sites delayed by T/4. In another embodiment, the stimulation at different locations is variable in parameters other than timing such as frequency or pulse width, or a combination of these. These variations are similarly designed to retrain the brain by dephasing, overriding or obscuring the abnormal network dynamics. In yet another embodiment, the stimulation may occur at a single location but vary in parameters over time. For example, it may vary in frequency every few seconds or turn on and off. In yet another embodiment, the stimulation is constant and at a single location. In preferred embodiments of these, the location is at the median nerve close to the wrist. Optimizing Stimulation: Sub-Sensory Stimulating at intensities below the sensory threshold will avoid the discomfort (tingling, numbness, pain) that can be associated with peripheral nerve stimulation. Because the exact electrode position, size and surface contact have a large effect on the stimulation level and the anatomical structures that receive the stimulation, the sensory threshold may needed to be calibrated for each patient and even for each session. This calibration may be done by the user manually setting the stimulation parameters or otherwise indicating their sensory threshold. Another possible mechanism is for the device to automatically sweep through a range of stimulation parameters and the patient chooses the most comfortable set of parameter values. Another possible mechanism is for the patient to choose from among a set of previously chosen parameter values that provided effective and comfortable stimulation. In some embodiments, the electrode pad can include a topical analgesic, such as Lidocaine, to reduce the discomfort from stimulation, thereby increasing the sensory threshold tolerated by the patient. In some embodiments, the topical analgesic can be delivered using a controlled release formation to provide pain relief for the duration the electrode pad is to be worn, which can be days, weeks or months. Such a method may provide more comfort or greater therapeutic effect, due to greater stimulation intensity and/or synergistic effects with the topical analgesic, which can reduce tremor in some patients. Optimizing Stimulation: High Frequency Alternatively or additionally, the stimulation waveform may be very high frequency, typically in the kHz and above, such that the stimulation is not felt by the user, or it is felt very little. Very high frequency stimulation is thought to make a conduction blockade. However, prior to the blockade there is an onset response including a strong depolarization of the nerve. To effectively implement very high frequency stimulation without causing discomfort for the patient, it would be preferable to eliminate this onset response. This can be done by cooling the nerve during the initial stimulation. Motor nerves are generally excited by stimulation at about 15 Hz and below, while sensory nerves are generally excited by stimulation at about 50 Hz and above. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to specifically stimulate above the 15 Hz threshold of motor neuron stimulation to avoid causing muscle contraction. Optimizing Stimulation: Triggered Alternatively or additionally, triggering the stimulation to the phase of the tremor can improve effectiveness. The goal of such stimulation is to break the rhythmic entrainment of motor units. More effective treatment may permit stimulating at lower levels to achieve similar therapeutic benefits with less discomfort. Essential tremor is essentially a problem of feedback in a resonant circuit. Stimulation timed off-phase from the tremor may reduce the tremor by altering the circuit dynamics, for example by shifting the gains on the feedback loop. As shown in FIG. 10B, bursts of high-frequency stimulation may be timed to occur when the wrist is at its maximum flexion or extension (FIG. 10A). In example (FIG. 10C), the bursts have been shifted to a random phase. The position of the hand (FIG. 10A) may determine the optimal stimulation duty cycle and timing, such as (FIG. 10B) stimulating off-resonance with the maximum tremor deviation or (FIG. 10C) using bursts of variable temporal delays to avoid resonance with the tremor. Alternatively or additionally, the stimulation may be chaotic or variable. The goal of chaotic, random or variable stimulation is to prevent habituation and reduce resonance in the circuit. For example, this may be implemented by varying the stimulation frequency over time and/or by superimposing higher and lower frequency components, as illustrated in FIG. 11. Alternatively or additionally, the stimulation may be high frequency alternating current. This has been shown to block action potentials as they transmit along axons and could adjust circuit dynamics. In some embodiments, the stimulation parameters as described above can be cycled according to a predetermined order to determine the optimal stimulation parameter. In some embodiments, the effectiveness of the stimulation parameters can be monitored over time to determine whether a particular set of stimulation parameters is losing effectiveness. In some embodiments, when the effectiveness of a particular set of stimulation parameters has been reduced by a predetermined amount, the stimulation parameters can be altered or cycled according to a predetermined order. For example, if stimulation is being triggered to the phase of the tremor, the stimulation can be delivered with random or variable temporal delays, or if the stimulation was using a set amplitude and/or frequency, the stimulation can be changed to a chaotic, random or variable modality to prevent or disrupt habituation. In some embodiments, the random or variable type stimulation parameters can be utilized according to a predetermined routine, such as daily for a predetermined number of hours, or weekly for a predetermined number of days, or at some other predetermined interval including time of day. Effector: Vibrotactile Stimulation The effector may be mechanical excitation of the proprioceptors by means including vibrotactile or haptic sensation. The mechanical stimulation might include force, vibration and/or motion. The effector induces action potentials in the target nerves by exciting the Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) or Pacinian corpuscles. Mechanical effectors can include, for example, small motors; piezoelectrics; one or more vibrotactile units comprised of a mass and an effector to move the mass such that a vibratory stimulus is applied to the body; an eccentric mass mounted on a shaft such that a vibratory stimulus is produced when the shaft is rotated; or an ultrasonic motor but can alternatively be a magnetorheological fluid (MRF) effector or electroactive polymer (EAP) effector. The vibratory stimulus is optimally 250 Hz, corresponding to the optimal sensitivity of the Pacinian corpuscles (also known as lamellar corpuscles). The Pacinian corpuscles are the nerve endings in the skin that sense touch and vibration. Deformation of the corpuscle opens pressure-sensitive sodium ion channels to cause action potentials. Alternatively, the vibration may be below 50 Hz to excite the Meissner's corpuscles (also called tactile corpuscles) in the fingers that are sensitive to light touch. This mechanical-type stimulator may function to reduce tremor through several methods. One method may be to transmit proprioceptive signals to the brain that obscure or modify the driving proprioceptive signal transmitted from the tremulous muscles. Another method may be impedance control. Joint impedance may altering co-contracting muscles through transcutaneous neurostimulation, affecting the stiffness of muscles and consequently muscle contractions. Another method may be the generation of compensatory muscle contractions, through neurostimulation, that oppose the tremulous contractions. The stimulator is preferably affixed firmly against the dermal surface, for example through an elastic or Velcro band . Effectors: Chemical, Thermal & Other The examples herein have primarily described the stimulation as electrical or vibrotactile. However, stimulation may alternately be achieved using other effectors that may offer significant benefit in terms of patient comfort, portability, safety or cost. In another variation of the embodiment, the effector may be a neuromodulating chemical that either raises or lowers neurons firing thresholds. The chemical used in the invention may be a topical anesthetics including, but not limited to the “caine” family. The “caine” family of anesthetics may include but are not limited to benzocaine, bupivacaine, butacaine, carbisocaine, chloroprocaine, ciprocaine, dibucaine, etidocaine, heptacaine, levobupivacaine, lidocaine, lidocaine hydrochloride, mepivacaine, mesocaine, prilocaine, procaine, propanocaine, ropivacaine, and tetracaine. Other chemical families may include those of menthol family, or alpha-hydroxy sanshool from Szechuan peppercorn, or capsaicin, all of which are known to influence peripheral sensory nerves. FIG. 12 shows a chemical stimulator that may deliver chemical stimulus transdermally through a patch or could be delivered by microinjection. The preloaded protocols may preferably be predetermined compositions of the one or more chemicals. The topical anesthetics in this invention may be known for other indications and the recommended doses for simulation have been tested and approved for treatment of other indications. For example, the topical anesthetic lidocaine may be administered at 2-10% by weight. Alternatively, lidocaine may be administered in conjunction with other anesthetics. As seen in FIG. 12, the two neuromodulating chemicals are mixed to provide a tailored composition. The chemical stimulator may be administered as a composition comprising lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5% by weight. Alternatively, the chemical stimulator could be administered as a composition comprising lidocaine 0.1-5% and prilocaine 0.1-5% by weight. The chemical stimulator may be alpha hydroxy sanshool from Szechuan peppercorn. The alpha hydroxy sanshool may be contained in an excipient or carrier. The excipient may include gels, creams, oils, or other liquid. If the method of delivery is a transdermal patch, the formulation of the chemical agent may preferably be a cream or gel. The composition can be selected by the user through the control module 740 (of FIG. 7). If the method of delivery is microinjection, the formulation may preferably be a solution. In some embodiments, the effector can be a temperature effector 732 (of FIG. 7) that induces cooling or heating. The effector may modulate neuronal firing by directly cooling the nerve or indirectly by cooling adjacent muscle, skin or other component of the arm. A temperature effector can include, for example, piezoelectrics (e.g. Peltier cooling tiles), circulating fluid, compressed expandable gas, cooled or warmed solid material or evaporative material. One example of a cooling effector can be as disclosed in U.S. Publication No. 2010/0107657, which is incorporated herein by reference. Heating or cooling may be applied as a patch that adheres to the dermal surface, by attachment to affix the stimulator to the dermal surface, such as an armband, or by an implant. In an embodiment with a thermal stimulator, the preloaded protocols may preferably be predetermined temperatures of stimulation and associated durations of stimulation. Preferably, a preloaded protocol may call for thermal cooling for the duration of 15 minutes and cooling temperatures in the range of 15-25° C. The duration of stimulation may be preprogrammed to (but is not limited to) approximately 5 minutes to 30 minutes. The maximum length of stimulation should be well tolerated by the user and not cause any muscular or neurological damage. Temperature sensors may function to detect the effective cooling temperature in an embodiment where the stimulator is a thermal stimulator. Effective cooling or heating temperature may be the temperature felt by the user, and this is not necessarily the same as the applied temperature. If the temperature sensors determine that the effective temperature reaches a threshold, which may range from 5 degrees C. greater or less than the applied temperature for a particular protocol, the processor 797 (from FIG. 7) may modify said protocol to cool or heat more than originally programmed to compensate for the discrepancy between effective and intended cooling. The invention may alternatively apply other effectors including acoustic (using ultrasonic excitation for exciting sensory nerves at the fingertips), vibratory, tactile, luminescent (e.g. light exposure in optogenetically modified nerves), magneticically (e.g. by rapidly switching RF fields) or a combination of mechanisms. Form Factors: General Wearable Stimulator Referring to FIG. 14A-E, the system 700 from FIG. 7 can be non-invasive, fully implantable, or partially implantable. For example, a non-invasive embodiment can include a non-invasive housing such as a sleeve 1400, or a patch 1410, or a glove. In such non-invasive embodiments, the interface of the housing is in communication with an external part of the patient. In some embodiments, one or more of the system components can be implanted 1420. For example, an effector and/or at least a portion of the housing interface can be implanted in the patient at a point of contact while the power source is external to the patient. A non-invasive system housing can facilitate in maintaining the interface and/or effector in close proximity to the patient. The sleeve can cover a long stretch of arm or be a narrow band. The sleeve can cover at least a portion of the circumference of any part of a limb or the sleeve may cover the full circumference of any part of the limb. The function of the sleeve may be to maintain the position of the external device relative to the implant. The purpose of maintaining the position may include achieving good power transfer, reliable communication or other purposes. The housing may be made of any material suitable to achieve the desired properties. For example, the housing material may be flexible and/or stretchable material, polymer or fabric. The housing can include fasteners such as Velcro, laces, toggles and/or ties to secure the device to the patient. The housing can include multiple layers and/or pockets configured to hold various components of the system as disclosed herein. The system may be positioned by the patient with or without the assistance of a caregiver. In some embodiments, the system may have assistive mechanisms to position it on the arm, such as pressure-responsive snaps and/or self-aligning magnets. In some embodiments, such as sleeve 1400, the system may be slipped on (similar to a sports sleeve) over the end of a limb or wrapped around the arm or self-wrapped around the arm (similar to a snap-band). In some embodiments, the housing may be in the form of a patch 1410. For example, a housing patch 1410 can be secured to the patient's skin using a removable or degradable adhesive. The patch may be worn for a variety of times, including but not limited to patches worn only during the period of stimulation and patches left in place for several days, weeks, or months. The patch may also be attached mechanically, chemically, or electrically. Such embodiments include but are not limited to staples, strings, or magnets that secure the patch in a desired place. In some embodiments, the non-invasive system can include an interface, which is in communication with the patient, but where the housing is not attached to the patient. For example, the system can be an external device with which the patient interacts. For example, the housing might be an open or closed tube-like structure in which the patient can place a limb. As illustrated in FIG. 14D, another example includes an external device that resembles a pad 1430 or support structure, such as a wrist pad or support, over which a patient can place at least a portion of a limb. In one embodiment, the housing 1450 may have the configuration of a wristwatch as shown in FIG. 14H-L worn on the wrist or arm of the user. The housing 1450 may contain an interface 1452 separated, partially separated, or connected to the housing, and which may interact with the user. The interface 1452 may connect to the housing 1450 and be disposable after use for a period of time. The electrodes 1454 of the interface may be arranged in strips and may be arranged in anode/cathode pairs. Other electrode configurations as described herein may also be used. The period of time may be after a single use, or after multiple uses over the period of minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months. The interface itself may be the entire portion that is the wristband or may be a portion of the wristband or be attached to the wristband. The wristband itself can be part of the interface or be part of the housing, or both. In one example, the wristband with or without the interface may snap around the wrist, by including a feature of elastic material that is slightly curved so that when moved, the wristband wraps into a circular shape around the wrist. In another example, there is a temperature sensitive material, like nitinol, that has shape memory, so that when the device comes into contact with skin, the wristband with or without the interface may change shape to wrap around the patient's wrist. In another example, the wristband with or without the interface has one or more metal wires inside or outside the wristband that retains a new shape when moved to allow the user to place the device on the wrist and add force to shape the wristband onto the user's unique anatomy. In another example, the wristband with or without the interface wraps partially or completely around the wrist. This wrap may be in the same axis, or may be a spiral wrap. The disposable or non-disposable interface may be connected to the housing in a number of different ways, including but not limited to snapping features, velco, pressfit, magnets, temperature, adhesive, that may or may not include self aligning features. The connection may be in one or more multiple dimensions or axes. As an example, FIGS. 14J-14L show one potential embodiment where there is a self aligning piece, that can be a magnet, that connects the interface to the body in 3 dimensions. The circular shape of the aligning piece may allow the first dimensional alignment in one plane. The bar shape portion of the aligning piece, which can be offset from the circular feature of the aligning piece, may align the interface in the proper axis. The overall shape of the aligning piece can align the interface in the final dimension, which in this particular example of embodiment is the depth. The housing can have a matching feature of this shape for which the connection can connect to. It is possible that the connection feature can be reversed and the aligning piece be placed on the housing, and the matching feature of shape be placed on the interface. These connections of the aligning piece can possibly have or not have magnets on one, both or none of the housing or interface components. Alternatively, the external device may be an object not worn on the body. For example, it may have the form factor of a cellphone and the patient would carry the device around in their pocket, bag, hand or other ways that cellphones are transported and supported, such as on a tabletop. It may be designed to sit on a furniture surface in the location where the patient wants their tremor controlled, such as at the dining room table, in the kitchen, or in their dressing room. As shown in FIG. 14M, another preferred embodiment of the invention may comprise a stimulation device with one or more electrodes 1460 applied along the spine. The stimulation device may function to stimulate the release of neurotransmitters and reduce tremor through neuromodulation of the nerves located along the spine. Stimulation may affect the release and uptake of neurotransmitters, thereby affecting the nerves innervating the tremulous regions. The electrodes are preferably placed on the dermal surface at the cervical spine roots, preferably from C1 to C8 but most preferably between C5 and C8. The electrodes are preferably patch electrodes. The operating unit is preferably affixable to the user and the leads connecting the electrodes to the operating unit are preferably magnetized for easy connection. The operating unit may be connected to and controlled by the processor. Since the electrodes are preferably placed along the spine (back side of the user), a detached and portable controls module may be more convenient for a user to operate. In one embodiment the electrodes may be placed on either side of the spine around C2 to C8 region of the neck and shoulders. The electrodes may be placed approximately 100 cm to 1 cm away from the spine, and may be placed 200 cm to 5 cm apart from each other. The stimulation parameters may include a phase duration of between 500 and 30 μseconds, which may preferably be 300-60 μseconds (micro-seconds). The pulse rate may range from 10 Hz to 5000 Hz, and the preferable range may be 50 Hz to 200 Hz, or 150 Hz. The cycle time may be continuous, or may range from 5 seconds to 1 hour. The preferable cycle time may be approximately 5 seconds to 20 seconds, or 10 seconds. The duration of electrical stimulation may range from 5 minutes to 24 hours per day. The preferable range may include 30 minutes to 60 minutes repeated approximately 10 times per day, or the preferable range may be approximately 40 minutes to 1 hours per day and repeated once per week to once every day. The amplitude (which may be used interchangeably with intensity) may range from 0.1 mA to 200 mA, and a preferable range may include 1 mA to 10 mA. The length of time the user may use the device before having an effect on the user's tremor may be one day to one month, or may preferably range from 2 days to 4 days. Form Factors: For Electrical Stimulation Conventional TENS devices are often difficult to position, bulky and uncomfortable. The innovations below are solutions to make it easy to quickly apply, adjust a simulator to control ET and to enable patients to use it discretely and comfortably. With a conventional TENS device, it is difficult to properly size and position the sticker electrodes to optimally target the desired nerve. Smaller electrodes increase the current density at the target nerve, but with smaller pads it is more likely they will miss the nerve, and higher current density from smaller electrodes can cause discomfort. Larger pads are easier to position, but need more power and are more likely to unintentionally stimulate adjacent tissues. The following innovations resolve these challenges and achieve consistent, effective, comfortable, and safe stimulation. Instead of using only a single electrode as the cathode and a single electrode as the anode, the device may contain an array of electrodes 1500, as illustrated in FIG. 15A-15C. Although the electrodes are shown individually on the patient's skin for the sake of clarity, in practice the array of electrodes can be integrated into a sleeve, flexible pad or substrate, or other form factor as described herein. An appropriate combination of electrodes would be selected each time the device is repositioned or based off the detected stimulation needs. The stimulation may use single electrodes as the anode and cathode, or may use a combination of electrodes to shape the simulation field. The electrode selection may be automatic based on feedback from sensors in the device (see below). Alternatively, the electrode selection may be done manually by the user. For example, the user may cycle through the electrode combinations until they find the combination that provides optimal tremor reduction or achieves a surrogate for the correct placement such as tingling in the 1st (index) and 2nd finger as occurs with median nerve sensory stimulation. FIG. 15A illustrates a two dimensional array of discrete electrodes 1500. Alternatively, some of the electrodes can be combined into linear rows, such that the two dimensional array is formed from a plurality of rows of electrodes. FIG. 15B illustrates a linear array of electrodes 1500 which can be worn as bands, as shown, or patches, pads, sleeves, and the like. FIG. 15C illustrates a housing 1502 that can be used to hold the array of electrodes 1500. Alternatively, electrical stimulation from a poorly positioned electrode may be redirected to the target nerve by modifying the conduction pathway between the electrode and the target nerve. For example, a conduction pathway enhancer 1600, which can be made from a conductive material, can be placed on the patient's skin, embedded into the skin, implanted, or a combination of the above, in order to enhance the conduction of the electrical stimulus from the electrode 1602 to the target nerve 1604, as illustrated in FIGS. 16A-16D. The conduction pathway enhancer may be placed over the nerve and/or across the nerve. For example, in one embodiments, a tattoo of conductive ink may direct off-target stimulation towards the median nerve. A tattoo more conductive than adjacent structures (i.e. blood vessels, nerves) will provide the path of least resistance and redirect the current. To place or position the conductive tattoo, the target nerve is first positively identified. Then the conductive tattoo is placed over the target nerve. As illustrated in FIGS. 16A-16D, the conductive tattoo may include a plurality of conductive stripes that cross the nerve. In some embodiments, the stripes can be parallel to each other and cross the nerve transversely. In other embodiments, the stripes can be formed into a star or cross hatch pattern with a center located over the nerve. In other embodiments, a stripe can also be placed over and parallel to the nerve (not shown). For user adoption, a wearable device should be discrete and comfortable. In the preferred embodiment shown in FIGS. 14B and 14F, for example, the effector is electrical and the skin patch has a single electrode or plurality of electrodes electronics printed onto a flexible substrate in a predetermined pattern to make a “second-skin”, similar to a bandaid. For optimal comfort and surface adhesion, the mechanical characteristics such as the elasticity and stiffness should be matched to the skin. The circuitry and wiring for surface electrical stimulation may be printed or etched into a flexible material such that the device conforms to the body or to tissue within the body. For example, it may be copper printed on a flexible substrate such as plastic. In another embodiment as illustrated in FIG. 14G, the device may be positioned on the surface of the body but containing a transcutaneous penetrating elements 1470 to improve influence on the nerves. These elements may be microneedles, used for improvement of stimulation and/or drug delivery. In some embodiments, the transcutaneous penetrating elements can form a microelectrode array that is placed on the skin surface and penetrates through the skin. The microelectrode array can function like microneedles, and can both improve signal transmission from the electrode to the nerve and to improve the permeability of the skin to improve topical drug delivery. Sensors: Types of Sensors The device or system may include sensors. Sensors for monitoring the tremor may include a combination of single or multi-axis accelerometers, gyroscopes, inclinometers (to measure and correct for changes in the gravity field resulting from slow changes in the device's orientation), magnetometers; fiber optic electrogoniometers, optical tracking or electromagnetic tracking; electromyography (EMG) to detect firing of tremoring muscle; electroneurogram (ENG) signals; cortical recordings by techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) or direct nerve recordings on an implant in close proximity to the nerve. FIGS. 17A-17B show representative positions of motion sensors on the (1710) hand or (1720) wrist. Other tracking locations may include the fingers or other body parts. The data from these tremor sensors is used measure the patient's current and historical tremor characteristics such as the amplitude, frequency and phase. These sensors may also be used to determine activities, such as to distinguish involuntary movements (e.g. tremor) from voluntary movements (e.g. drinking, writing) or the presence and absence of the tremor relative to the time of day or other detected activities such as sleep/wake cycles. The device may also include sensors to provide performance and usage data, including when the device was worn (e.g. from temperature sensors), the device's location (e.g. from GPS), battery level, or video recording. In another embodiment, the sensor is a temperature sensor to measure the temperature of a cooled limb. In another embodiment, the sensor includes video recording. In another embodiment, sensors from existing hardware such as a smartphone are used. For example, the tremor may be measured using the accelerometers on a smartphone or engaging the patient in a tremor-inducing writing task by analyzing a line traced on a smartphone screen. Sensors: Algorithms to Extract Tremors Algorithms will be used to extract information about tremors from the stream of data provided by the sensors. The tremor may be identified based off its time-domain signal, frequency-domain signal, amplitude, or firing pattern (e.g. bursts, spikes). For example, in FIG. 18A-18B, the frequency analysis of the spectral power of gyroscopic motion data indicates that the tremor is centered at approximately 6.5 Hz (see the maximum power in the lower plot). Motion data can be taken as each raw sensor channel or by fusing the raw signals of multiple sensors. As one example, multi-axis accelerometer data can be combined into a single numerical value for analysis. The algorithm will extract motion data in the 4 to 12 Hz range to remove motions that are not attributable to the tremor. This may be done using any combination of notch filters, low pass filters, weighted-frequency Fourier linear combiners, or wavelet filters. As each patient has a dominant tremor frequency, this range may be narrowed based on specific knowledge of the patient's tremor or tremor history. For example, for a patient with a 6 Hz tremor an analysis algorithm may extract only motion data in the 5 to 7 Hz range. Alternatively, if a patient is known to have a tremor that flexes and extends the wrist by a maximum of 5-degrees then an analysis algorithm would determine that a measured motion of 45-degree wrist flexion is likely due to intentional gross movement rather than tremor. Alternatively, the algorithm will sample the motion data by identifying time periods likely to correspond to postural holds or kinetic fine motor tasks. Once the appropriate motion data has been extracted, the algorithm will analyze key characteristics of the tremor including the amplitude, center frequency, frequency spread, amplitude, phase, and spectral power. Sensor fusion techniques can also be used to analyze different aspects of the tremor. For example, a multi-axis accelerometer and gyroscope attached to the backside of the hand could be combined to reduce noise and drift and determine an accurate orientation of the hand in space. If a second pair of multi-axis accelerometer and gyroscope were also used on the wrist, the joint angle and position of the wrist could be determined during the tremor. This could isolate what excitations of which nerves are causing damping of the different muscle groups controlling the tremor. ET patients have two components of their tremor. Kinetic tremors are present during intentional movement and have a major impact on quality of life because they impact a person's ability to accomplish daily tasks like drinking, eating writing and dressing. Postural tremors are present during static positions held against gravity. They can be embarrassing, though are less impactful on quality of life. Postural tremors typically present earlier in the disease course and are thought to drive kinetic tremors. Both components are typically in the range of 4 to 12 Hz, with older patients experiencing lower frequency tremors. Detecting postural and kinetic tremors is more challenging than detecting resting tremors. Resting tremors are present in other movement disorders including Parkinson's disease and can be easily identified by analyzing tremors present only while the limb is at rest. Extracting kinetic tremors from motion data is challenging because it is necessary to separate the motion due to tremor from the motion due to the task. Identifying postural tremors may be easier than kinetic tremors since accelerometer/gyroscopic data during kinetic tasks are corrupted by the motion involved in the task. It is thought that postural tremors may drive the kinetic tremors because people often have postural tremors earlier in life than kinetic tremors and they are about the same frequency. The correlation of postural and kinetic tremors we discovered in our clinical study, as illustrated in FIG. 19, supports this theory of using postural tremor data to analyze or treat kinetic tremors. Sensors: Data Storage & Usage As shown in FIG. 20, the stimulation device 2000 can contain hardware, software and firmware to record and transmit data such as the tremor characteristics, stimulation history, performance, usage and/or control of the device to a data portal device 2002, such as a smartphone, cell phone, tablet computer, laptop computer, desktop computer or other electronic device using a wireless communication protocol, such as Bluetooth. Data recorded using the device used the ET patients can be stored on a smartphone that transmits it to a cloud-based database/server 2004, or the device used by the ET patients may directly transmit data to a cloud-based database/server 2004, enabling many activities including tracking tremors, optimizing stimulation, sharing with caregivers and physicians, and building community. The data may provide information to the controller, real-time feedback to the patient, caregivers and/or clinicians, or may store the data to provide historical data to the patient, caregivers and clinicians. The data stored on the cloud 2004 can be viewed on multiple platforms 2006 by multiple users 2008. In addition, the data on the cloud 2004 can be pooled and analyzed by a computing device 2010. Patients are generally monitored for tremor every few months, or perhaps annually, when they visit their physician. This monitoring is typically highly subjective. Further, tremor severity can be dramatically affected by many factors, including sleep patterns, emotional status, previous physical activity, caffeine intake, food, medications etc. Such infrequent and inaccurate monitoring limits the ability of patients, their caregivers and physicians to understand the severity and progression of a patient's ET and the effects of various treatments and behaviors. These factors can interact with the effects of the stimulation provided by the device, and it can be difficult to detect these interactions. These interactions could be identified to optimize the therapy and help patients better understand how their behavior affects their tremor. In one embodiment shown in FIG. 21A, the tremor is 2100 monitored using sensors that may be IMUs, electrodes, or any of the other sensors previously discussed. The monitoring may be continuous or during discrete time periods. The data from these sensors is 2110 analyzed to identify changes in the tremor characteristics (amplitude, frequency etc.) over time. The results are recorded and 2120 displayed to the user. The 2110 analysis and/or 2120 display may be done on the stimulation device itself or by communicating either the raw or analyzed data to a secondary device such as a smartphone or computer. In another embodiment, 2101 behavioral data may also be collected such that the analysis may examine the relationship between the tremor history and the user's behaviors. Behavioral data may include consumption of caffeine, alcohol, medications and anxiety levels. The system can then alert the patient of the interactions between the behaviors and the tremor. In another embodiment in which the device is therapeutic (i.e. if it has an effector), the 2102 stimulation history may be collected such that the analysis may examine the relationship between the stimulation history and the tremor characteristics. The embodiment shown in FIG. 21B adds a 2140 upload to the cloud. The order of 2140 upload and 2110 analysis may be swapped such that the analysis is done on-board prior to upload (not shown). Use of the cloud enables the results to be 2120 displayed to the user on a variety of networked devices including smartphone, tablets, laptops and desktop computers; to other users such as 2150 physicians or caregivers; or for 2160 pooled analysis across multiple patients. FIG. 21C shows some of the potential uses of the pooled data, including 2170 connecting patients to similar patients based on features such as their tremor characteristics, geography, age and gender or 2180 improving the stimulation algorithms. FIG. 21D shows how the data monitoring and analysis shown in FIGS. 21A-C may be used in a closed loop to adjust the stimulation parameters. In this way, the algorithms detect interactions between the variables to optimize the therapy. The device may contain closed-loop control of the stimulation to adaptively respond to detected tremor or activity levels. The device enables sensation of tremor through an activity sensor, data logging and systematic adjustment of the stimulation parameters to achieve an optimal tremor reduction. FIG. 26A is a control diagram showing the basic components of this detection and response system. The (2650) target defines the intended profile. For example, in ET patient this profile may be absence of tremor and in a PD patient this profile may be absence of tremor or rigidity. The (2670) error between the (2650) target and (2660) detection is fed into the (2680) controller, which modifies the (2690) output. The (2680) controller may include a processor and memory. In addition to the error and measurements, the (2680) controller algorithms may also input the history of measurements, stimulation and activity into its algorithms. The output (2690) modifies the stimulation. If the effector is electrical, this may include modifying the waveform, frequency, phase, location and/or amplitude of the stimulation. In the preferred embodiment (FIG. 15), the device contains an array of small electrodes and the output modifies the selection of which electrodes to use as the anode and cathode. The effect of the modifications are then (2660) detected by the measurement device and the process repeats. The (2660) detection and/or (2690) output modification may occur continuously in real-time, with periodic delays between predefined times (e.g. hourly or daily), or in response to a user-generated signal such as a pre-defined sequence of movements or a button press. Alternatively, the controller may alert the patient to manually modify the stimulation parameters. This closed loop may be used for automatic self-calibration. FIG. 26B illustrates a control diagram showing the basic components of this detection and response system, which is similar to the description shown in FIG. 26A, but now with internally and externally located components. The control could also take into account other patterns in behavior, more like a feed-forward controller 2640. For example, typical patterns in eating times could cause the effector to fire more actively at particular times to reduce tremor for those activities. Also, the person could indicate in a schedule, based upon their activities for the day if they would like increased treatment at certain periods of time, for example if they had aspeech or other anxiety causing events. This type of information could also be obtained and learned over time by the control unit. Other data such as sleep, food intake, particularly alcohol and caffeine consumption, exercise history, emotional status, particularly levels of anxiety, and medication usage collected through other mobile technologies and applications, such as Azumio, Jawbone, Fitbit, etc., which may be integrated into the cloud-based patient database, as illustrated in FIGS. 20 and 21. The user can be prompted to enter such data, such as taking a photo of a meal to determine food uptake using an imaging processing application. The database will combine discrete events (e.g., time and amount of caffeine intake) with time series data (e.g., tremor measurements). Algorithms will examine the relationship between patient behaviors, stimulation, and tremor. These will optimize stimulation and alert the patient of the behaviors that influence tremor. This will allow for individually optimized treatment for tremor and feed forward into the system. In some embodiments, the user may be prompted at predetermined times by the device or cell phone to perform a specific task, which may be tailored to the type of tremor afflicting the patient, such as holding the arm out in a specific posture for ET, or placing the arm in a rest position for Parkinson's. During this time, the sensors can record the tremors. In some embodiments, the patient may additionally or alternatively be instructed to consume caffeine or to record the time period that has elapsed since they last consumed caffeine. This data may be used to determine how caffeine affects tremor, the efficacy of the treatment protocol and stimulation parameters, the duration of the effectiveness, and the like. In some embodiments, the patient can be prompted at a predetermined amount of time after stimulation, such as 10, 20, 30, and/or 60 minutes after stimulation. The time can be adjusted depending on measured duration of the tremor reduction following stimulation. The device will have on-board data logging and may transmit this information to an external data portal device, such as a smartphone or internet-enabled charge & sync station. This transmission may be wireless or direct. The external device will have greater storage capacity and allow transmission to a database in the cloud. The external device may analyze this data on-board and present information on a screen or using indicators such as LED lights, or the data may be shown on the stimulation device itself The data in the cloud will be viewable on multiple platforms including smartphones, tablets and computers. The data will be viewable by multiple people including the user, his or her physicians, caregivers or family members. This will provide a much more comprehensive picture of a patient's tremor and enable optimization of treatment. In some embodiments, users viewing the data can also add comments and notes to the data, which can be tagged with the identity of the user making the comment or note, and the time the comment or note was made. In some embodiments, the ability to make annotations can be restricted to the health care providers, such as the patient's physician, and the patient. In some embodiments, access to the data is restricted to the health care providers and the patient. Access can be limited by requiring users to set up a secure username and password to access the data. In some embodiments, the patient can also provide others, such as family and friends, with access to the data. Algorithms For Optimization Our data indicate that stimulation using a TENS device is highly effective in some patients, somewhat effective in other patients, and ineffective in others. However, optimization of the simulation parameters (simulation intensity, frequency, waveform, duty cycle, phasing etc.) enables the device to achieve the greatest tremor reduction with the most comfort in each patient and allows the device to adjust over time in response to changes in the circuit dynamics, device positioning, patient state, etc. FIG. 22 shows a decision algorithm/controller for device. In one embodiment, the optimization algorithm starts by initializing one or more parameters 2200, which may include stimulus amplitude, expected frequency, on-time duration, off-time duration, and expected stimulation effect delay time. Next, a sensor detects 2202 and records tremor characteristics, including tremor amplitude, frequency, phase, and other characteristics described herein. The detected tremor characteristics 2202 are compared with desired target tremor characteristics 2204, which may be no tremor or a reduced tremor. The comparison step 2206 can determine the error or difference between the detected tremor characteristics and the target tremor characteristics, and determine whether tremor or reduced tremor is present 2208, or in other words, whether the detected tremor meets or exceeds the target conditions. If no tremor is detected, or more generally, if a predetermined target tremor condition is not exceeded, then the algorithm loops back to the detection step 2202. If a tremor is detected, or more generally, if a predetermined target tremor condition is exceeded, then stimulation can be turned on 2210. Once the stimulation has exceeded the set on-time duration 2212, then the stimulation is turned off 2214, and the algorithm proceeds back to the detection step 2202. While stimulation is on, the device can upload the recorded data 2218 to the cloud or another device for further processing. Once the stimulation has been turned off 2214, the algorithm can monitor the off-time duration 2216, and can continue to upload data 2218 once the off-time duration has elapsed. Alternatively, data can be uploaded even before the off-time has elapsed. User-reported events 2220, which can include caffeine or alcohol intake, feelings of anxiety, and other events that may affect tremor, can also be entered into the system and sent to the cloud. The data can be processed by a controller 2222 which can optimize the stimulation parameters using various algorithms, including machine learning algorithms. Once the parameters are optimized, the new stimulation parameters are set 2224. A report 2226 can also be sent to the patient that can highlight or correlate various behaviors identified in the user-reported events with measured tremors. In one embodiment, the stimulation algorithm is designed to optimize the therapeutic “on”-time. The optimization algorithm may find the best solution for outputs including but not limited to controlling tremor during specific tasks, at specific times of day, in specific location or simply to optimize the overall daily minimization of tremor. The algorithm may be self-calibrating to adjust stimulation parameters including but not limited to the frequency, amplitude, pulse width, electrode selection for cathode and anode and/or timing of turning the stimulation on and off. The algorithm may respond user input or may be entirely pre-programmed. The algorithm may be a learning algorithm to tailor the stimulation over time to adjust in real-time to a patient's tremor or patient-defined needs. The stimulation may be triggered on or off in response to inputs including but not limited to user input (e.g. turning the device on or and off), timing since previous use, time of day, detection of tremor (e.g. by accelerometers), electrical recordings, or algorithms based on the previously described or other inputs. As an example, the user can use voice activation to turn the device off to utilize the therapeutic window (i.e., the time of tremor reduction after stimulation is turned off) to provide a time interval of steadiness needed for intentional movements. In another example, the user bites down or uses the tongue muscle detected by an external device placed inside or outside the oral cavity, which will signal to turn off the stimulation and allow the user steadiness of the arm to enable execution of intention actions with steadiness. In some embodiments, the system and algorithm can detect the type of tremor, such as differentiating between a postural tremor and kinetic tremor, based on an analysis of the tremor parameters and the measured activity of the patient. In some embodiments, the stimulation parameters may be determined in part based on the type of tremor detected. In some embodiments, the system can be controlled by an event trigger. Event triggers can include defined movements, temperature, voice activation, GPS location, or based on data received by a sensor or any combination thereof. For example, the device can be turned on or off during an intentional movement, such as, before a tremor has started or ended respectively. In another example, the device is turned on or off when a specified temperature is reached. The system may act to achieve a desired tremor suppression profile. For example, the control may activate the device during a period of desired tremor suppression; prior to a period of desired tremor suppression, with effects lasting beyond the use of the device; and/or in response to detection of the tremor. Optimization Based on Community Data At present, the time course of tremors is poorly understood. While creating a database for a single patient will improve our ability to reduce tremor in that patient, combining individual patient data into a database that includes recordings from many patients enables more powerful statistical methods to be applied to identify optimal stimulation parameters. In some embodiments, data from patients suffering from the same type of tremor can be combined. In some embodiments, the tremor data from each patient can include searchable and sortable metadata that allow the collection of data in the database to be sorted, searched and/or reorganized on demand. The metadata can include type of tremor (tremor amplitude, tremor frequency, temporal presence of tremor etc.), name, age, race, sex, location, time, food and drink consumption (particularly for caffeine and alcohol), activity history (exercise, sleep etc.), medications, past treatments, and current treatments. The systems described above with respect to FIGS. 20 and 21 can be adapted to data from many patients going into a database, and the algorithms can operate on the massive set of data. Community Building Individuals with ET feel isolated by the disability associated with their tremor. As a result, they are highly motivated to meet other people with ET. There is an active and growing set of support groups that organize meetings and enable patients with ET talk about their issues and discuss possible solutions. Attending these meetings can be challenging because some patients with ET have difficulty driving. Also, the individuals within a particular physical location who attend a support group may have symptoms that are different from each other, and they lack the ability to identify other patients that are most like each other. Algorithms can help individuals find members of the ET community that have similar profiles. For example, algorithms can characterize patients based their age, tremor severity, tremor features, success with treatment, treatment type, medication type, location (based on address or GPS), and other characteristics. This will help them communicate with each other and to share information from the central community website that is customized to a particular individual with ET or a caregiver. For example, system can identify patients within a geographical location or identify other patients within a predetermined distance from a particular patient. Patients may have the option of joining an online ET community and making their location searchable on the system. The system may identify to a patient existing ET community support groups within a predetermined distance. Other Processor, Library, Data Storage The processor 797, as illustrated in FIGS. 7A-7D for example, may function to operate on data, perform computations, and control other components of the tremor reduction device. It may preferably be a microprocessor with peripherals or a microcontroller. For example, the processor could receive input from the user via the controls module 740 and could control the execution of stimulation as selected by the user. In another embodiment, the processor 797 could execute predefined stimulation protocols selected by the user. These stimulation protocols could be found in the digital library of stimulation protocols 798, which may be loaded in the processor 797 or stored in external memory, like an EEPROM, SD card, etc. The processor 797 can also receive information from the sensors 780 and process that information on board and adjust the stimulation accordingly. The selection of the processor is determined by the degree of signal processing it needs to do and the number and type of peripherals it needs to control. Communication with peripherals can be executed by any of the well-known standards such as USB, UART, SPI, I2C/TWI, for example. The processor may also communicate wirelessly with other device components using Bluetooth, Wifi, etc. The processor may be on board the device, or the tremor data be transmitted via a wireless link between the processing unit and the stimulation unit. In an embodiment with an electrical stimulator 730, the preloaded protocols 798 may be electrical stimulation or a sequence of electrical stimulations. Electrical stimulation or electrical signal refers to an electrical pulse or pattern of electrical pulses. The electrical stimulation may include parameters such as pulse frequency, amplitude, phase, pulse width, or time duration of electrical stimulation. These parameters may be predefined or controlled by the user. The data storage unit 770 may function to store operational statistics about the device and usage statistics about the device, preferably in NAND flash memory. NAND flash memory is a data storage device that is non-volatile, which does not require power to retain the stored information, and can be electrically erased and rewritten to. In some cases, it may be beneficial to have this memory be removeable in the form of a micro-SD card. Power The effector may be electrically coupled to one or more power sources, as illustrated in FIGS. 7A-7D for example. The power source 750 functions to power the device. The power source 750 may be connected to the processor 797 and provide energy for the processor to run. The power source may preferably be rechargeable and detachable as this allows the device to be reused. The power source may preferably be a battery. Several different combinations of chemicals are commonly used, including lead-acid, nickel cadmium (NiCd), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), lithium ion (Li-ion), and lithium ion polymer (Li-ion polymer). Methods of recharging the battery are preferably attaching to a wall socket or other powered device, solar power, radio frequency, and electrochemical. An alternative source of power is ultracapacitors. Ultracapacitors may be divided into three different families—double-layer capacitors, pseudocapacitors, and hybrid capacitors. Ultracapacitors may preferably be made with nanoporous material including activated charcoal, graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbide-derived carbons, carbon aerogel, solid activated carbon, tunable nanoporous carbon, and mineral-based carbon. Ultracapacitors provide an advantage of faster charging than batteries as well as tolerance of more charge and discharge cycles. Batteries and ultracapacitors could alternatively be used in conjunction as the tolerance of ultracapacitors to a large number of charge-discharge cycles makes them well suited for parallel connections with batteries and may improve battery performance in terms of power density. Alternatively, the power source may harness energy from the body. In some embodiments the power can be harnessed by kinetic motion, by thermal energy, and/or by sound. The power source may alternatively include a plug to an external source, such as a general appliance. In one embodiment, a special charging station or dongle could be used to recharge the device. The benefit of the special charging station is that it could also facilitate the upload of data from the device to the web via Wifi or another communication protocol. Implants In some embodiments, at least a portion of the system is implantable. An implanted stimulator may offer greater control and comfort than surface stimulation because it is located closer to the nerve and avoids exciting cutaneous afferents. The method of stimulating peripheral nerves to control hand tremors introduces specific requirements for an appropriate implanted stimulator. First, the implant should be small to minimize the invasiveness of the procedure used to position the implant and make it appropriate for implantation. Second, because the stimulation may be responsive to the detected tremor or user input, the implant should be capable of receiving communication from an external device. Third, the device should tolerate variability in the positioning of the external device. Any number of the system components disclosed herein can be implanted. In some embodiments, the housing, interface, effector and power source are implanted and the controller is external to the patient. In such embodiments, the controller, may be, for example, in wireless communication with the effector. In other embodiments, the power source is external to the patient. The device may be implanted subcutaneously, partially implanted, or may be transcutaneous (passing through the skin), may be on the surface of the skin or may not be in contact with the body. It may be an assembly of these devices, such as a surface component that communicates with or powers an implanted component. If it is implanted, the device may be implanted in or around nerves, muscle, bone, ligaments or other tissues. In one embodiment, the implant is positioned in or near the carpal tunnel to influence the nerves passing through the carpal tunnel. In another embodiment, the implant is positioned on or near the median nerve in the upper arm between the biceps. In another embodiment, the implant is positioned on or near the median, radial or ulnar nerve in the forearm or wrist. In another embodiment, the implant is positioned on or near the brachial plexus to influence the proprioceptive nerves passing from the arm toward the central nervous system. The implanted portions may be placed or delivered intravascularly to affect nerves in the area within range of the implant's effect. In one example, a device is placed in or through the subclavian artery or vein to affect the nerves of the brachial plexus. As shown in FIG. 23, a preferred embodiment of a controllable device for a user to reduce essential tremor comprises electrodes 2310 made from biocompatible materials implanted at least partially sub-dermally to stimulate targeted nerves; an external operating unit 2320, which contains a user controls interface, connected by leads to the implanted electrode 2310. The device may contain further elements which may include a processor 797 that performs computations and controls other components; a processor controlled function generator; a digital library 799 stored on the processor or memory which contains preloaded modulation protocols; a sensor 780 connected to or in communication with the processor 797 which detects predefined parameters and transmits that parameter information to the processor; a data storage unit 770 connected to the sensor and processor; and a power supply 750. In this embodiment, the implanted electrodes 2310 may function to provide direct electrical stimulation to the targeted nerves. Since the electrodes are implanted at least partially into the body and will remain an extended period of time (preferably several years), the electrodes may be made of material that has suitable electrical properties and is biocompatible. The electrode 2310 material is preferably selected from a group including silicones, PTFE, parylene, polyimide, polyesterimide, platinum, ceramic, and gold, or of natural materials such as collagen or hyaluronic acid. The electrodes 2310 can be of varying shape and size but importantly contact the nerves of interest. Electrode shapes include planar shanks, simple uniform microwires, and probes that taper to a thin tip from a wider base. The electrode may have a proximal end and a distal end. The distal end, may contact the nerves, and be adapted to deliver neural stimulation pulses to the selected nerves. The proximal end of the lead may be adapted to connect to the external operating unit run by a processor 797. In a variation of the embodiment, there may be multiple leads connected to different nerve bundles. In another variation, there may be wireless communication with the implant as shown in FIGS. 24A-24D. The implant 2400, which can be a microelectrode or microstimulator, can be inserted proximate the nerve using needle insertion. The needle 2402 can be inserted into the patient next to or near the target nerve 2404, and then the implant can be ejected from the needle. The implant 2400 can be in communication with, transfer and receive data with, and be powered by an externally located device 2406, such as a decision unit described herein. In one embodiment, the Interface may be an implanted nerve cuff. The cuff may either fully or partially encircle the nerve. The cuff may be attached to the nerve by means of closing butterfly arm electrodes. In another embodiment, the Interface may be a nerve abutment. The abutment may be in close proximity to the nerve or may lie along the nerve. The function of the cuff may be to provide good contact or close proximity between the device and the nerve. In another embodiment, the Interface may be anchored on the nerve or sheath around the nerve. For example, the device may be wrapped around, tied to, clamped to, tethered with small barbs to or chemically fused to the nerve or nerve sheath. The function of the cuff, coil, abutment or anchor is to provide good contact or close proximity between the device and the nerve. Some of these embodiments are depicted in FIGS. 25A-25F. For example, FIGS. 25A-25C illustrate an embodiment of a coil electrode interface, which can be a multi-coil electrode, as shown, or a single coil electrode. In some embodiments, the coil electrode 2500 can be made of a shape memory material, such as nitinol, and can have a relaxed, straight configuration before insertion and implantation, and a coiled configuration after exposure to body temperature. FIGS. 25D and 25E illustrate embodiments of butterfly cuff type electrodes 2510, which may at least partially encircle the nerve. As in other embodiments, the interface can include single or multiple electrodes, and can be fabricated from a shape memory material to have an open configuration during delivery and a closed configuration wrapped around the nerve after implantation. FIG. 25F illustrates an embodiment of an interface having a linear array of electrodes 2520 that can abut against and lie along the nerve. The method of inserting the implant may involve local or general anesthesia. The implant may be delivered through one or more punctures in the skin, such as a needle or suture, or it may be an open incision made in the skin to access the target area, or it could include both methods. In one embodiment, the device may be implanted by threading all or part of the device around the nerve and or surrounding tissue, such as blood vessels or tendons. In one embodiment, the implant may include two electrodes positioned along a vascular pathway. The pathway may be along the palmar arch and the electrodes may be positioned in the brachial and axillary arteries. The fluid column between the electrodes may carry electricity and stimulate adjacent nerves. The electrodes may be either internal to the vascular pathway, like a stent, or external to the vascular pathway similar to a vascular wrap. In one embodiment, the device may be an implant capable of two-way communication with an external device. The embodiment may contain memory. The external “listener” device may also be a power source. The implant could communicate information such as its power reserves or usage history to the “listener”. In another embodiment, the device is an implant capable of sensing activity on the nerve or adjacent nerves and reporting this information to the listener. In another embodiment, the device or devices used to place the device may use ultrasound for guidance. Ultrasound may be used to measure proximity to blood vessels, nerves or other tissues, or to characterize the type and location of adjacent tissues. In another embodiment, the electrodes for stimulation may be injected as a liquid. In another embodiment, the electrodes may be flexible and delivered in a viscous medium like hyaluronic acid. In another embodiment, the electrodes may be made of nitinol that takes its shape at 37 degrees Celsius. This would permit injecting or inserting the electrodes in one configuration, such as an elongated configuration to fit in a needle, and then would take their form when warmed to body temperature. Some of these examples are depicted in FIG. 25. The implant may contain the necessary components for uni-directional or bi-directional communication between the implant, an external power transmission, a communication system, and/or electronics to store programmable stimulation parameters. The device may contain a wireless micromodule that receives command and power signals by radiofrequency inductive coupling from an external antenna. If the effector is electrical, the incoming communication channel may include information including the stimulation frequency, delay, pulsewidth and on/off intervals. Transcutaneous charging or powering reduces the implant size by eliminating the need for a large power source (e.g. battery) and eliminates the need to replace the power source with repeat surgeries. An external component may be used to wirelessly power the internal component, such as by radiofrequency (RF) power transfer. For example, the external device may emit RF power that the internal component receives with a resonant coil. The power may be transmitted at a variety of wavelengths, including but not limited the radiofrequency and microwave spectrums, which range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz. Alternatively, the internal device may contain a battery. The external device may be worn or carried on the body, or it may be in the nearby surroundings such as on a nearby table or wall. It may be portable or fixed. The device may contain a capacitative energy storage module electrode that stimulates when it discharges. The electronics may be significantly simplified if the powering itself drives the stimulation profile. The capacitor blocks direct current while allowing alternating current to pass. When the capacitor reaches its dielectric breakdown, it discharges and releases a stimulation pulse. The implant may also sense the tremor directly, such as by using electroneurography (ENG) or electromyography (EMG) signals or an accelerometer or a combination of the above. In this case, the implant may include multiple electrodes since microelectrodes and macroelectrodes are preferable for sensing and stimulating, respectively. The device may also include an outgoing communication channel to communicate the detected events. Various embodiments of a tremor altering device and methods for using it have been disclosed above. These various embodiments may be used alone or in combination, and various changes to individual features of the embodiments may be altered, without departing from the scope of the invention.
