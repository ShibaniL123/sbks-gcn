135.3: 5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-(2-methanesulphonyl-ethyl)-1-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (compound 135)
A mixture containing 71 mg (0.06 mmol) of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate in 311 mg (9.2 mmol) of hydrogen peroxide is added to a solution containing 240 mg (0.4 mmol) of 5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-1-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-3-(2-methylsulphanyl-ethyl)-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione in 4.8 ml of ethanol. After stirring at room temperature for 46 hours, 5 ml of dichloromethane is added and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for a further 48 hours. It is then hydrolysed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate and the product is extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase is washed twice with 10% aqueous solution of sodium thiosulphate and once with water, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product is chromatographed on silica gel eluted with a dichloromethane/methanol mixture 97/3, the white solid obtained is taken up in 2 ml of ethyl acetate and stirred slowly at room temperature for 16 hours. The suspension obtained is filtered and rinsed once with 2 ml of diethyl ether, then dried under vacuum. 150 mg (59%) of 5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-(2-methanesulphonyl-ethyl)-1-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a white solid with a melting point of 212Â° C.
