FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to a functional sweetener and orally ingestible compositions containing same. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Nutrition usually focuses on the relationship between food and human health from the perspective of ensuring all essential nutrients are adequately supplied and utilized to optimize health and well being. As diseases typically related to nutritional deficiency were managed, there has been a recognition that many nutrients have health benefits beyond basic nutrition. Accordingly, functional ingredients have been identified as playing a key role in an individual's overall health. “Functional ingredients” offer potential health benefits beyond basic nutrition when incorporated into foods, beverages, and other orally ingested products. Such ingredients have been shown to help reduce the risk of or manage a number of health concerns, including cancer, heart and cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal health, menopausal symptoms, osteoporosis, and vision. Since 1993, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved numerous health claims for the labeling of food products with information related to the health benefits of functional food (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, A Food Labeling Guide (2000)). Functional Food Health Benefit Potassium Reduced risk of high blood pressure and Diets low in sodium stroke Plant sterol and stanol esters Reduced risk of coronary heart disease Soy protein Fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber Diets low in dietary saturated fat and cholesterol Calcium Reduced risk of osteoporosis Fruits, vegetables, and fiber- Reduced risk of cancer containing grain products Diets low in dietary fat Folate Reduced risk of neural tube birth defects Dietary sugar alcohol Reduced risk of dental caries (cavities) Although not yet approved by the FDA for the purposes of labeling, numerous other functional foods are believed to provide health benefits beyond those listed above, such as reduced inflammation. Functional ingredients generally are classified into categories such as carotenoids, dietary fiber, fatty acids, flavonoids, isothiocyanates, phenols, plant sterols and stanols (phytosterols and phytostanols); polyols; prebiotics/probiotics; phytoestrogens; soy protein; sulfides/thiols; amino acids; proteins; vitamins; and minerals. Functional ingredients also may be classified based on their health benefits, such as cardiovascular, cholesterol-reducing, and anti-inflammatory. Health trends also have promoted an increased use of non-caloric high-potency sweeteners in consumer diets. Although natural caloric sweetener compositions, such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose, provide the most desirable taste to consumers, they are caloric. Numerous natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners are non-caloric; however, they exhibit sweet tastes that have different temporal profiles, maximal responses, flavor profiles, mouthfeels, and/or adaptation behaviors than that of sugar. For example, the sweet tastes of natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners are slower in onset and longer in duration than the sweet taste produced by sugar and thus change the taste balance of a food composition. Because of these differences, use of natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners to replace a bulk sweetener, such as sugar, in a food or beverage, causes an unbalanced temporal profile and/or flavor profile. In addition to the difference in temporal profile, high-potency sweeteners generally exhibit (i) lower maximal response than sugar, (ii) off tastes including bitter, metallic, cooling, astringent, licorice-like taste, etc., and/or (iii) sweetness which diminishes on iterative tasting. It is well known to those skilled in the art of food/beverage formulation that changing the sweetener in a composition requires re-balancing of the flavor and other taste components (e.g., acidulants). If the taste profile of natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners could be modified to impart specific desired taste characteristics to be more sugar-like, the type and variety of compositions that may be prepared with that sweetener would be expanded significantly. Accordingly, it would be desirable to selectively modify the taste characteristics of natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners. It also would be desirable to improve the taste of ingestible compositions that include functional ingredients to promote their use and the resulting health benefits. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Generally, this invention addresses the above described need by providing a functional sweetener composition having improved temporal profile and/or flavor profile and a method for improving the temporal profile and/or flavor profile of a functional sweetener composition. In another particular embodiment, this invention provides a functional sweetened composition comprising a sweetenable composition in combination with a functional sweetener composition having an improved temporal profile and/or flavor profile, and a method for improving the temporal profile and/or flavor profile of the functional sweetened composition. In particular, this invention improves the temporal profile and/or flavor profile by imparting a more sugar-like temporal profile and/or flavor profile. More particularly, this invention comprises a functional sweetener composition or a functional sweetened composition comprising at least one fatty acid; at least one high-potency sweetener; and at least one sweet taste improving composition. Objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms and abbreviations used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Reference now will be made in detail to the presently proffered embodiments of the invention. Each example is provided by way of explanation of embodiments of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment, can be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover such modifications and variations within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. Embodiments of this invention include functional sweetener compositions and functional sweetened compositions comprising at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one sweet taste improving composition, and at least one functional ingredient. Also embodied in this invention are methods for making functional sweetener compositions and functional sweetened compositions. I. Functional Ingredients In a particular embodiment, a sweetener composition comprises at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one sweet-taste improving composition, and at least one functional ingredient. The functional ingredient desirably comprises at least one fatty acid. Fatty acids (including long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids), and especially omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids, are nutrients required in the human diet. However, omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids are not synthesized in human body, but are found in natural sources such as the oil of certain plants and animals, including fishes, walnuts, lingonberries, hemp, flax, chia, perilla, purslane, and algae. Since essential fatty acids such as omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids are not synthesized by the body, they, and their health benefits, must be obtained through food or dietary supplement. Therefore, omega-3 fatty acids have been used as beneficial functional ingredients for various compositions, including beverages. In addition, long chain omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) are known to enhance cognitive function and maintain cardiovascular health, among other health benefits (See, e.g., von Schacky, C., “Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,” Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care 7, no. 2 (March 2004): 131-6, and Simopoulos, A. P., “Essential Fatty Acids in Health and Chronic Disease,” American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 79, no. 3 (March 2004): 523-4). Furthermore, consumer trends indicate demand for products containing long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are increasing. An additional health consideration is the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 (particularly linoleic acid to alpha-linolenic acid) fatty acids intake. Recently, it has been found that the ingested ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is important to maintaining cardiovascular health. As a consequence of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids competing for the same metabolic enzymes, the omega-6:omega-3 ratio will significantly influence the ratio of resultant eicosanoids (i.e., hormones) (e.g., prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes) and will alter a body's metabolic function. In particular, it is recommended that the omega-6:omega-3 ratio ingested be between about 5:1 and about 1:1. As used herein, “fatty acid” refers to any straight chain monocarboxylic acid and includes saturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, long chain fatty acids, medium chain fatty acids, short chain fatty acids, fatty acid precursors (including omega-9 fatty acid precursors), and esterified fatty acids. As used herein, “long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid” refers to any polyunsaturated carboxylic acid or organic acid with a long aliphatic tail. As used herein, “omega-3 fatty acid” refers to any polyunsaturated fatty acid having a first double bond as the third carbon-carbon bond from the terminal methyl end of its carbon chain. In particular embodiments, the omega-3 fatty acid may comprise a long chain omega-3 fatty acid. As used herein, “omega-6 fatty acid” any polyunsaturated fatty acid having a first double bond as the sixth carbon-carbon bond from the terminal methyl end of its carbon chain.

II. Natural and/or Synthetic High-Potency Sweeteners The sweetener compositions provided also comprise at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener. As used herein the phrases “natural high-potency sweetener”, “NHPS”, “NHPS composition”, and “natural high-potency sweetener composition” are synonymous. “NHPS” means any sweetener found in nature which may be in raw, extracted, purified, or any other form, singularly or in combination thereof and characteristically have a sweetness potency greater than sucrose, fructose, or glucose, yet have less calories. Non-limiting examples of NHPSs suitable for embodiments of this invention include rebaudioside A, rebaudioside B, rebaudioside C, rebaudioside D, rebaudioside E, rebaudioside F, dulcoside A, dulcoside B, rubusoside, stevia, stevioside, mogroside IV, mogroside V, Luo Han Guo sweetener, siamenoside, monatin and its salts (monatin SS, RR, RS, SR), curculin, glycyrrhizic acid and its salts, thaumatin, monellin, mabinlin, brazzein, hernandulcin, phyllodulcin, glycyphyllin, phloridzin, trilobtain, baiyunoside, osladin, polypodoside A, pterocaryoside A, pterocaryoside B, mukurozioside, phlomisoside I, periandrin I, abrusoside A, and cyclocarioside I. NHPS also includes modified NHPSs. Modified NHPSs include NHPSs which have been altered naturally. For example, a modified NHPS includes, but is not limited to, NHPSs which have been fermented, contacted with enzyme, or derivatized or substituted on the NHPS. In one embodiment, at least one modified NHPS may be used in combination with at least one NHPS. In another embodiment, at least one modified NHPS may be used without a NHPS. Thus, modified NHPSs may be substituted for a NHPS or may be used in combination with NHPSs for any of the embodiments described herein. For the sake of brevity, however, in the description of embodiments of this invention, a modified NHPS is not expressly described as an alternative to an unmodified NHPS, but it should be understood that modified NHPSs can be substituted for NHPSs in any embodiment disclosed herein. In one embodiment, extracts of a NHPS may be used in any purity percentage. In another embodiment, when a NHPS is used as a non-extract, the purity of the NHPS may range for example from about 25% to about 100%. According to other embodiments, the purity of the NHPS may range from about 50% to about 100% from about 70% to about 100%; from about 80% to about 100%; from about 90% to about 100%; from about 95% to about 100%; from about 95% to about 99.5%; from about 96% to about 100%; from about 97% to about 100%; from about 98% to about 100%; and from about 99% to about 100%. Purity, as used here, represents the weight percentage of a respective NHPS compound present in a NHPS extract, in raw or purified form. In one embodiment, a steviolglycoside extract comprises a particular steviolglycoside in a particular purity, with the remainder of the stevioglycoside extract comprising a mixture of other steviolglycosides. To obtain a particularly pure extract of a NHPS, such as rebaudioside A, it may be necessary to purify the crude extract to a substantially pure form. Such methods generally are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. An exemplary method for purifying a NHPS, such as rebaudioside A, is described in the co-pending patent application No. 60/805,216, entitled “Rebaudioside A Composition and Method for Purifying Rebaudioside A,” filed on Jun. 19, 2006, by inventors DuBois, et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly described, substantially pure rebaudioside A is crystallized in a single step from an aqueous organic solution comprising at least one organic solvent and water in an amount from about 10% to about 25% by weight, more particularly from about 15% to about 20% by weight. Organic solvents desirably comprise alcohols, acetone, and acetonitile. Non-limiting examples of alcohols include ethanol, methanol, isopranol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol, and isobutanol. Desirably, the at least one organic solvent comprises a mixture of ethanol and methanol present in the aqueous organic solution in a weight ratio ranging from about 20 parts to about 1 part ethanol to 1 part methanol, more desirably from about 3 parts to about 1 part ethanol to 1 part methanol. Desirably, the weight ratio of the aqueous organic solvent and crude rebaudioside A ranges from about 10 to about 4 parts aqueous organic solvent to 1 part crude rebaudioside A, more particularly from about 5 to about 3 parts aqueous organic solvent to 1 part crude rebaudioside A. In an exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A is carried out at approximately room temperature. In another embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the step of heating the rebaudioside A solution to a temperature in a range from about 20° C. to about 40° C., or in another embodiment to a reflux temperature, for about 0.25 hours to about 8 hours. In another exemplary embodiment, wherein the method for purifying rebaudioside A comprises the step of heating the rebaudioside A solution, the method further comprises the step of cooling the rebaudioside A solution to a temperature in the range from about 4° C. to about 25° C. for about 0.5 hours to about 24 hours. According to particular embodiments, the purity of rebaudioside A may range from about 50% to about 100%; from about 70% to about 100%; from about 80% to about 100%; from about 90% to about 100%; from about 95% to about 100%; from about 95% to about 99.5%; about 96% to about 100%; from about 97% to about 100%; from about 98% to about 100%; and from about 99% to about 100%. According to particularly desirable embodiments, upon crystallization of crude rebaudioside A, the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition comprises rebaudioside A in a purity greater than about 95% by weight up to about 100% by weight on a dry basis. In other exemplary embodiments, substantially pure rebaudioside A comprises purity levels of rebaudioside A greater than about 97% up to about 100% rebaudioside A by weight on a dry basis, greater than about 98% up to about 100% by weight on a dry basis, or greater than about 99% up to about 100% by weight on a dry basis. The rebaudioside A solution during the single crystallization step may be stirred or unstirred. In an exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the step of seeding (optional step) the rebaudioside A solution at an appropriate temperature with high-purity crystals of rebaudioside A sufficient to promote crystallization of the rebaudioside A to form pure rebaudioside A. An amount of rebaudioside A sufficient to promote crystallization of substantially pure rebaudioside A comprises an amount of rebaudioside A from about 0.0001% to about 1% by weight of the rebaudioside A present in the solution, more particularly from about 0.01% to about 1% by weight. An appropriate temperature for the step of seeding comprises a temperature in a range from about 18° C. to about 35° C. In another exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the steps of separating and washing the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition may be separated from the aqueous organic solution by a variety of solid-liquid separation techniques that utilize centrifugal force, that include, without limitation, vertical and horizontal perforated basket centrifuge, solid bowl centrifuge, decanter centrifuge, peeler type centrifuge, pusher type centrifuge, Heinkel type centrifuge, disc stack centrifuge and cyclone separation. Additionally, separation may be enhanced by any of pressure, vacuum, and gravity filtration methods, that include, without limitation, the use of belt, drum, nutsche type, leaf, plate, Rosenmund type, sparkler type, and bag filters and filter press. Operation of the rebaudioside A solid-liquid separation device may be continuous, semi-continuous or in batch mode. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition also may be washed on the separation device using various aqueous organic solvents and mixtures thereof. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition can be dried partially or totally on the separation device using any number of gases, including, without limitation, nitrogen and argon, to evaporate residual liquid solvent. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition may be removed automatically or manually from the separation device using liquids, gases or mechanical means by either dissolving the solid or maintaining the solid form. In still another exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the step of drying the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition using techniques well known to those skilled in the art, non-limiting examples of which include the use of a rotary vacuum dryer, fluid bed dryer, rotary tunnel dryer, plate dryer, tray dryer, Nauta type dryer, spray dryer, flash dryer, micron dryer, pan dryer, high and low speed paddle dryer and microwave dryer. In an exemplary embodiment, the step of drying comprises drying the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition using a nitrogen or argon purge to remove the residual solvent at a temperature in a range from about 40° C. to about 60° C. for about 5 hours to about 100 hours. In yet another exemplary embodiment, wherein the crude rebaudioside A mixture comprises substantially no rebaudioside D impurity, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the step of slurrying the composition of substantially pure rebaudioside A with an aqueous organic solvent prior to the step of drying the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. The slurry is a mixture comprising a solid and an aqueous organic or organic solvent, wherein the solid comprises the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition and is only sparingly soluble in the aqueous organic or organic solvent. In an embodiment, the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition and aqueous organic solvent are present in the slurry in a weight ratio ranging from about 15 parts to 1 part aqueous organic solvent to 1 part substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. In one embodiment, the slurry is maintained at room temperature. In another embodiment, the step of slurrying comprises heating the slurry to a temperature in a range from about 20 to about 40° C. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition is slurried for about 0.5 hours to about 24 hours. In still yet another exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the steps of separating the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition from the aqueous organic or organic solvent of the slurry and washing the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition followed by the step of drying the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. If further purification is desired, the method of purifying rebaudioside A described herein may be repeated or the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition may be purified further using an alternative purification method, such as the column chromatography. It also is contemplated that other NHPSs may be purified using the purification method described herein, requiring only minor experimentation that would be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art. The purification of rebaudioside A by crystallization as described above results in the formation of at least three different polymorphs: Form 1: a rebaudioside A hydrate; Form 2: an anhydrous rebaudioside A; and Form 3: a rebaudioside A solvate. In addition to the at least three polymorph forms of rebaudioside A, the purification of rebaudioside A may result in the formation of an amorphous form of rebaudioside A, Form 4. The aqueous organic solution and temperature of the purification process influence the resulting polymorph and amorphous forms in the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. FIGS. 1-5 are exemplary powder x-ray diffraction (XRPD) scans of the polymorph and amorphous forms of rebaudioside A: Form 1 (hydrate), Form 2 (anhydrate), Form 3A (methanol solvate), Form 3B (ethanol solvate), and Form 4 (amorphous), respectively. The material properties of the three rebaudioside A polymorph and amorphous forms are summarized in the following table: TABLE 1 Rebaudioside A Polymorph and Amorphous Forms Form 1 Form 2 Form 3 Form 4 Polymorph Polymorph Polymorph Amorphous Rate of Very low Intermediate High High dissolution (<0.2%/60 (<30%/5 (>30%/5 (>35.0%/5 in H2O at minutes) minutes) minutes) minutes) 25° C. Alcohol <0.5% <1% 1-3% <0.05% content Moisture >5% <1% <3% 6.74% content The type of polymorph formed is dependent on the composition of the aqueous organic solution, the temperature of the crystallization step, and the temperature during the drying step. Form 1 and Form 3 are formed during the single crystallization step while Form 2 is formed during the drying step after conversion from Form 1 or Form 3. Low temperatures during the crystallization step, in the range of about 20° C. to about 50° C., and a low ratio of water to the organic solvent in the aqueous organic solvent results in the formation of Form 3. High temperatures during the crystallization step, in the range of about 50° C. to about 80° C., and a high ratio of water to the organic solvent in the aqueous organic solvent results in the formation of the Form 1. Form 1 can be converted to Form 3 by slurrying in an anhydrous solvent at room temperature (2-16 hours) or at reflux for approximately (0.5-3 hours). Form 3 can be converted to Form 1 by slurrying the polymorph in water at room temperature for approximately 16 hours or at reflux for approximately 2-3 hours. Form 3 can be converted to the Form 2 during the drying process; however, increasing either the drying temperature above 70° C. or the drying time of a substantially pure rebaudioside A composition can result in decomposition of the rebaudioside A and increase the remaining rebaudioside B impurity in the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition.

III. Sweet Taste Improving Compositions The sweetener composition also comprises a sweet taste improving composition, non-limiting examples of which include carbohydrates, polyols, amino acids and their corresponding salts, polyamino acids and their corresponding salts, sugar acids and their corresponding salts, nucleotides, organic acids, inorganic acids, organic salts including organic acid salts and organic base salts, inorganic salts, bitter compounds, flavorants and flavoring ingredients, astringent compounds, proteins or protein hydrolysates, surfactants, emulsifiers, flavonoids, alcohols, polymers, other sweet taste improving taste additives imparting such sugar-like characteristics, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, a single sweet taste improving composition may be used in combination with a single natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener. In another embodiment of the present invention, a single sweet taste improving composition may be used in combination with one or more natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweeteners. In yet another embodiment, one or more sweet taste improving compositions may be used in combination with a single natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener. In a further embodiment, there may be a plurality of sweet taste improving combinations used in combination with one or more natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweeteners. In a particular embodiment, combinations of at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and at least one sweet taste improving composition suppress, reduce, or eliminate undesirable taste and impart sugar-like characteristics to the sweetener. As used herein, the phrase “undesirable taste” includes any taste property which is not imparted by sugars, e.g. glucose, sucrose, fructose, or similar saccharides. Non-limiting examples of undesirable tastes include delayed sweetness onset, lingering sweet aftertaste, metallic taste, bitter taste, cooling sensation taste or menthol-like taste, licorice-like taste, and/or the like. In one embodiment, a sweetener composition exhibits a more sugar-like temporal and/or sugar-like flavor profile than a sweetener composition comprising at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, but without a sweet taste improving composition is provided. As used herein, the phrases “sugar-like characteristic,” “sugar-like taste,” “sugar-like sweet,” “sugary,” and “sugar-like” are synonymous. Sugar-like characteristics include any characteristic similar to that of sucrose and include, but are not limited to, maximal response, flavor profile, temporal profile, adaptation behavior, mouthfeel, concentration/response function behavior, tastant and flavor/sweet taste interactions, spatial pattern selectivity, and temperature effects. These characteristics are dimensions in which the taste of sucrose is different from the tastes of natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners. Whether or not a characteristic is more sugar-like is determined by expert sensory panel assessments of sugar and compositions comprising at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, both with and without a sweet taste improving composition. Such assessments quantify similarities of the characteristics of compositions comprising at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, both with and without a sweet taste improving composition, with those comprising sugar. Suitable procedures for determining whether a composition has a more sugar-like taste are well known in the art. In a particular embodiment, a panel of assessors is used to measure the reduction of sweetness linger. Briefly described, a panel of assessors (generally 8 to 12 individuals) is trained to evaluate sweetness perception and measure sweetness at several time points from when the sample is initially taken into the mouth until 3 minutes after it has been expectorated. Using statistical analysis, the results are compared between samples containing additives and samples that do not contain additives. A decrease in score for a time point measured after the sample has cleared the mouth indicates there has been a reduction in sweetness perception. The panel of assessors may be trained using procedures well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In a particular embodiment, the panel of assessors may be trained using the Spectrum™ Descriptive Analysis Method (Meilgaard et al, Sensory Evaluation Techniques, 3rd edition, Chapter 11). Desirably, the focus of training should be the recognition of and the measure of the basic tastes; specifically, sweet. In order to ensure accuracy and reproducibility of results, each assessor should repeat the measure of the reduction of sweetness linger about three to about five times per sample, taking at least a five minute break between each repetition and/or sample and rinsing well with water to clear the mouth. Generally, the method of measuring sweetness comprises taking a 10 mL sample into the mouth, holding the sample in the mouth for 5 seconds and gently swirling the sample in the mouth, rating the sweetness intensity perceived at 5 seconds, expectorating the sample (without swallowing following expectorating the sample), rinsing with one mouthful of water (e.g., vigorously moving water in mouth as if with mouth wash) and expectorating the rinse water, rating the sweetness intensity perceived immediately upon expectorating the rinse water, waiting 45 seconds and, while waiting those 45 seconds, identifying the time of maximum perceived sweetness intensity and rating the sweetness intensity at that time (moving the mouth normally and swallowing as needed), rating the sweetness intensity after another 10 seconds, rating the sweetness intensity after another 60 seconds (cumulative 120 seconds after rinse), and rating the sweetness intensity after still another 60 seconds (cumulative 180 seconds after rinse). Between samples take a 5 minute break, rinsing well with water to clear the mouth.

For example, non-limiting combinations of the natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and sweet taste improving compositions include: 1. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and at least one carbohydrate;2. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and at least one polyol;3. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and at least one amino acid;4. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and at least one other sweet taste improving additive;5. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one carbohydrate, at least one polyol, at least one amino acid, and at least one other sweet taste improving additive;6. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one carbohydrate, and at least one polyol;7. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one carbohydrate, and at least one amino acid;8. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one carbohydrate, and at least one other sweet taste improving additive;9. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one polyol, and at least one amino acid;10. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one polyol, and at least one other sweet taste improving additive;11. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one amino acid, and at least one other sweet taste improving additive;12. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one carbohydrate, at least one polyol, and at least one amino acid;13. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one carbohydrate, at least one polyol, and at least one other sweet taste improving additive;14. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one polyol, at least one amino acid, and at least one other sweet taste improving additive; and15. at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one carbohydrate, at least one amino acid, and at least one other sweet taste improving additive. These fifteen major combinations further may be broken down into further combinations in order to improve the overall taste of the natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener or the orally ingestible compositions comprising the natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener. As explained above, the sweet taste improving composition is selected from the group consisting of polyols, carbohydrates, amino acids, other sweet taste improving additives, and combinations thereof. The other sweet taste improving additives useful in embodiments of this invention are described hereinabove. In one embodiment, a single sweet taste improving composition may be used with a single natural or synthetic high-potency sweetener and at least one functional ingredient. In another embodiment of the present invention, a single sweet taste improving composition may be used with one or more natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweeteners and at least one functional ingredient. In yet another embodiment, one or more sweet taste improving compositions may be used with a single natural or synthetic high-potency sweetener and at least one functional ingredient. In a further embodiment, there may be a plurality of sweet taste improving compositions used in combination with one or more natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweeteners and at least one functional ingredient.

For example, the at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener may be in a pure, diluted, or concentrated form as a liquid (e.g., solution), solid (e.g., powder, chunk, pellet, grain, block, crystalline, or the like), suspension, gas state, or combinations thereof may be contacted with the at least one sweet taste improving composition which may be in a pure, diluted, or concentrated form as a liquid (e.g., solution), solid (e.g., powder, chunk, pellet, grain, block, crystalline, or the like), suspension, gas state, or combinations thereof and with the at least one functional ingredient which may be in pure, diluted, or concentrated form as a liquid (e.g., solution), solid (e.g., powder, chunk, pellet, grain, block, crystalline, or the like), suspension, gas state, or combinations thereof before all are contacted with an orally ingestible composition. In yet another embodiment, when there are more than one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, more than one sweet taste improving composition, or more than one functional ingredient, each component of the functional sweetener composition may be added simultaneously, in an alternating pattern, in a random pattern, or any other pattern. IV. Tabletop Functional Sweetener Compositions In a particular embodiment of the present invention, the functional sweetener compositions comprise a tabletop functional sweetener composition comprising at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener in combination with: (i) at least one functional ingredient; (ii) at least one bulking agent; and (iii) optionally at least one sweet taste improving composition and/or anti-caking agent with improved temporal and/or flavor profile. In accordance with particular embodiments, suitable “bulking agents” include maltodextrin (10 DE, 18 DE, or 5 DE), corn syrup solids (20 or 36 DE), sucrose, fructose, glucose, invert sugar, sorbitol, xylose, ribulose, mannose, xylitol, mannitol, galactitol, erythritol, maltitol, lactitol, isomalt, maltose, tagatose, lactose, inulin, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyols, polydextrose, cellulose and cellulose derivatives, fructooligosaccharides, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Additionally, in accordance with still other embodiments of the invention, granulated sugar (sucrose) or other caloric sweeteners such as crystalline fructose, other carbohydrates, or sugar alcohols can be used as a bulking agent due to their provision of good content uniformity without the addition of significant calories. In one embodiment, a bulking agent may be used as a sweet taste improving composition. As used herein the phrase “anti-caking agent” and “flow agent” refer to any composition which prevents, reduces, inhibits, or suppresses at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener molecule from attaching, binding, or contacting to another natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener molecule. Alternatively, anti-caking agent may refer to any composition which assists in content uniformity and uniform dissolution. In accordance with particular embodiments, non-limiting examples of anti-caking agents include cream of tartar, calcium silicate, silicon dioxide, microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel, FMC BioPolymer, Philadelphia, Pa.), and tricalcium phosphate. In one embodiment, the anti-caking agents are present in the tabletop functional sweetener composition in an amount from about 0.001 to about 3% by weight of the tabletop functional sweetener composition. Tabletop functional sweetener compositions are embodied and packaged in numerous different forms and it is intended that the tabletop functional sweetener compositions of the present invention may be of any form known in the art. In accordance with particular embodiments, non-limiting examples include powder form, granular form, packets, tablets, sachets, pellets, cubes, solids, and liquids. In an embodiment, a tabletop functional sweetener composition comprises a single-serving (portion control) packet comprising a dry-blend of a functional sweetener formulation. Dry-blend formulations generally may comprise powder or granules. Although the tabletop functional sweetener packet may be of any size, an illustrative non-limiting example of conventional portion control tabletop sweetener packets are approximately 2.5 by 1.5 inches and hold approximately 1 gram of a sweetener composition having a sweetness equivalent to 2 teaspoons of granulated sugar (˜8 g). The amount of natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener in a dry-blend tabletop functional sweetener formulation will vary due to the varying potency of different natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweeteners. In a particular embodiment, a dry-blend tabletop functional sweetener formulation may comprise a natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener in an amount from about 1% (w/w) to about 10% (w/w) of the tabletop functional sweetener composition. Solid tabletop functional sweetener embodiments include cubes and tablets. A non-limiting example of conventional cubes are equivalent in size to a standard cube of granulated sugar, which is approximately 2.2×2.2×2.2 cm3 and weigh approximately 8 g. In one embodiment, a solid tabletop sweetener is in the form of a tablet or any other form known to those skilled in the art. A tabletop functional sweetener composition may also be embodied in the form of a liquid, wherein the NHPS is combined with a liquid carrier. Suitable non-limiting examples of carrier agents for liquid tabletop functional sweeteners include water, alcohol, polyol, glycerin base or citric acid base dissolved in water, and mixtures thereof. Due to the varying potencies of the different high-potency sweeteners, the amount of high-potency sweetener in a liquid tabletop functional sweetener formulation will also vary. The sweetness equivalent of a tabletop functional sweetener composition for any of the forms described herein or known in the art may be varied to obtain a desired sweetness profile. For example, a tabletop functional sweetener composition may comprise a sweetness comparable to that of an equivalent amount of standard sugar. In another embodiment, the tabletop functional sweetener composition may comprise a sweetness of up to 100 times that of an equivalent amount of sugar. In another embodiment, the tabletop functional sweetener composition may comprise a sweetness of up to 90 times, 80 times, 70 times, 60 times, 50 times, 40 times, 30 times, 20 times, 10 times, 9 times, 8 times, 7 times, 6 times, 5 times, 4 times, 3 times, and 2 times that of an equivalent amount of sugar. In one embodiment, the tabletop functional sweetener composition may also be formulated for targeted uses, for example, in beverage, food, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, herbal/vitamins, tobacco, and in any other products which may be sweetened. For example, a tabletop functional sweetener composition for baking may be formulated having additional protecting agents such as encapsulants. Other forms will be readily apparent to those skilled in the tabletop sweetener art. Commonly used methods for making powder or granulated functional sweetener formulations for packets include fluid bed agglomeration processes. Other methods for making tabletop sweetener compositions are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Those skilled in the art appreciate that the amount of natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and amount and types of sweet taste improving composition, bulking agent, and/or anti-caking agent can be modified in order to tailor the taste of the tabletop sweetener composition to a desired profile and end use. Specific embodiments of tabletop sweetener compositions and methods of making tabletop functional sweetener compositions are disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/805,209, filed on Jun. 19, 2006, by DuBois, et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Generally, the amount of natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener present in a sweetened composition varies widely depending on the particular type of sweetened composition and its desired sweetness. Those of ordinary skill in the art can readily discern the appropriate amount of sweetener to put in the sweetened composition. In a particular embodiment, the at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener is present in the sweetened composition in an amount in the range of about 1 to about 5,000 ppm of the sweetened composition and the at least one sweet taste improving composition is present in the sweetened composition in an amount in the range of about 0.1 to about 100,000 ppm of the sweetened composition. In accordance with particular embodiments, suitable amounts of natural high-potency sweeteners for sweetenable compositions comprise amounts in the range from about 100 ppm to about 3,000 ppm for rebaudioside A; from about 50 ppm to about 3,000 ppm for stevia; from about 50 ppm to about 3,000 ppm for stevioside; from about 50 ppm to about 3,000 ppm for mogroside IV; from about 50 ppm to about 3,000 ppm for mogroside V; from about 50 ppm to about 3,000 ppm for Luo Han Guo sweetener; from about 5 ppm to about 300 ppm for monatin, from about 5 ppm to about 200 ppm for thaumatin; and from about 50 ppm to about 3,000 ppm for mono-ammonium glycyrrhizic acid salt hydrate. In accordance with particular embodiments, suitable amounts of synthetic high-potency sweeteners for sweetenable compositions comprise a range from about 1 ppm to about 60 ppm for alitame; from about 10 ppm to about 600 ppm for aspartame; from about 1 ppm to about 20 ppm for neotame; from about 10 ppm to about 500 ppm for acesulfame potassium; from about 50 ppm to about 5,000 ppm for cyclamate; from about 10 ppm to about 500 ppm for saccharin; from about 5 ppm to about 250 ppm for sucralose; from about 1 ppm to about 20 ppm for N—[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-α-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester; from about 1 ppm to about 20 ppm for N—[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-3-methylbutyl]-L-α-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester; and from about 1 ppm to about 20 ppm for N—[N-[3-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl]-L-α-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester.

Specific combinations of sweet taste improving compositions are disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/739,302 and 60/739,124. In particular embodiment, the at least one functional ingredient may require special processing in order to be incorporated into the functional sweetened composition. This is particularly relevant when the functional sweetened composition is aqueous and the at least one functional ingredient is hydrophobic. Techniques of incorporating hydrophobic compositions into aqueous solutions are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, non-limiting examples of which include homogenization, encapsulation, emulsions, and addition of stabilizers, gums, and the like. In a particular embodiment, the process for producing a substantially stable dispersion of the at least one functional ingredient in an aqueous functional sweetened composition comprises mixing the at least one functional ingredient with the aqueous orally ingestible composition to form a first dispersion of particles, heating the first dispersion of particles, and homogenizing the heated first dispersion particles to obtain an aqueous functional sweetened composition comprising particles of the at least one functional ingredient ranging in size from about 0.1 micron to about 50 microns. This method is disclosed further in U.S. application Ser. Nos. 10/458,692 and 11/315,206, filed on Oct. 24, 2003, and Dec. 23, 2005, respectively, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The functional sweetener compositions and orally ingestible compositions containing the same are useful for providing healthy benefits beyond basic nutrition. For example, such benefits may be cardiovascular, including the lowering of cholesterol levels in the blood and preventing or treating heart disease (e.g., atherosclerosis, restenosis, and thrombosis). The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which are not to be construed in any way as imposing limitations upon the scope thereof. On the contrary, it is to be clearly understood that resort may be had to various other embodiments, modifications, and equivalents thereof which, after reading the description therein, may suggest themselves to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention and/or the scope of the appended claims. Unless otherwise specified, %'s are by weight. Example Set A Example A1 A model diet beverage having a fatty acid, a high-potency sweetener, and a sweet taste improving composition may be prepared. The fatty acid can be microalgae DHA oil (from Martek Bioscience, Boulder, Colo.). The high potency sweetener may be rebaudioside A. The sweet taste improving composition may comprise erythritol. Additional components of the model beverage include dl-limonene-99 (>99% dl-limonene) as a dispersing agent. The model diet beverage formula, without the fatty acid and dispersing agent, is listed in Table 2 below. TABLE 2 Model Diet Beverage Composition Ingredient Weight (grams) DI water 964.679 Citric acid 1.881 Sodium benzoate 0.60 Vitamin C 0.34 Rebaudioside A 2.5 Erythritol 30.0 An emulsion comprising the fatty acid and the dispersing agent in a ratio of 1:1 can be prepared using the following procedure. First, a mucilage can be prepared with a liquid medium comprising a solution of water, sodium benzoate, ascorbic acid, and citric acid. To form the mucilage, a 600 ml beaker can be filled with water. The beaker can be placed under a propeller based agitator. Sodium benzoate can be added to the mixing vortex. After 3 minutes, ethylenediaminetetraacetate acid disodium salts can be added to the mixing vortex. After another 3 minutes, ascorbic acid can be added to the mixing vortex. After 3 minutes, citric acid can be added to the mixing vortex. After another 3 minutes, an emulsifier, which is modified gum arabic (e.g., Ticamulsion™, from TIC Gums, Belcamp, Md.), can be slowly added to the mixing vortex to minimize air incorporation. Agitation can be continued for 1 hour. The resulting emulsifier solution can be rested overnight to allow the solution to foam, separate, and allow coarse debris to settle. Next, a pre-emulsion can be made from the emulsifier solution. The emulsifier solution can be filtered through a 100 mesh screen. The filtered emulsifier solution can then be placed under the propeller based agitator. The oil blend comprising the fatty acid and the dispersing agent can be slowly added to the mixing vortex to produce a coarse emulsion. The coarse emulsion can then be transferred to a high shear mixer such as a Polytron PT3100 or a Pri Sci 250. The mixer can be set at a setting of 4 and the coarse emulsion can be mixed for 2 minutes to yield a pre-emulsion. The pre-emulsion can then be placed in a vacuum chamber and de-gased for 3 minutes. The pre-emulsion can then be homogenized. Prior to producing the final emulsion, deionized water can be passed through a Nanomizer and the plunger speed can be adjusted to achieve a homogenization pressure of 31 MPa (4500 psi). The pre-emulsion can be homogenized twice at 31 MPa in the Nanomizer while the plunger speed can be adjusted as necessary to achieve the desired homogenization pressure. The pre-emulsion can then be placed in a vacuum chamber for 3 minutes for de-aeration and the head space can be purged with nitrogen. This pre-emulsion, having 15% by weight emulsifier and 15% by weight of the fatty acid and the dispersing agent blend, can then be mixed into the model diet beverage. Example A2 An orange flavored beverage with 32 mg of DHA per 200 ml can be produced. Emulsion concentrates can be made in a 75 gram batch using the formulation in Table 3 and the method of Example A1. Then, 1.5 g of the emulsion concentrates can be added to 198.5 g of water or carbonated water to yield the orange flavored beverage with DHA.

Example F A solution of rebaudioside A (>97% pure by HPLC) was prepared in double distilled water (12.5 gm in 50 mL, 25% concentration) by stirring the mixture at 40° C. for 5 minutes. An amorphous form of rebaudioside A was formed by immediately using the clear solution for spray drying with the Lab-Plant spray drier SD-04 instrument (Lab-Plant Ltd., West Yorkshire, U.K.). The solution was fed through the feed pump into the nozzle atomizer which atomized it into a spray of droplets with the help of a constant flow of nitrogen/air. Moisture was evaporated from the droplets under controlled temperature conditions (about 90 to about 97° C.) and airflow conditions in the drying chamber and resulted in the formation of dry particles. This dry powder (11-12 g, H2O 6.74%) was discharged continuously from the drying chamber and was collected in a bottle. The solubility in water at room temperature was determined to be >35.0%. Example Set G Sensory evaluation of the samples prepared in Example Set G was carried out under the following protocol, similar to that described hereinabove. In this test protocol, none of the samples were swallowed. All samples were expectorated and the mouth was rinsed with water after the tasting. Immediately upon sensing maximal sweetness, the sample was expectorated, the mouth was rinsed with water and the rate of sweetness decay (“Sweetness Linger”) was measured, where attention was focused on the sweetness 3-4 min after the water rinse. After sample tasting was complete, a salty oyster cracker was chewed followed by a water rinse, and at least 5 minutes followed before tasting the next sample. The sweetness linger was rated by a panel of experts in the sensory evaluation of foods and beverages using the following scale: 0=no sweetness linger, 1=very slight sweetness linger, 2=slight sweetness linger, 3=moderate sweetness linger, 4=moderately high sweetness linger, 5=high sweetness linger. The “Sweetness Linger” rating for sucrose observed by this protocol is defined as 0. The Sweetness Linger of a 500 ppm of REBA control sample is defined as 5. Experimental samples were tasted by the same protocol, always allowing sufficient time between samples to ensure re-equilibration of the sensory system. Re-tasting of control samples during the course of the experiment was allowed and encouraged. The comparison taste test was performed between two controls and addition of sweet taste improving additive on the onset and/or sweetness linger. Control Samples REBA is a natural non-caloric sweetener with a very clean flavor profile (i.e., only sweet) and an acceptable sweetness onset rate but with a sweetness which lingers quite noticeably more than that of carbohydrate sweeteners.
