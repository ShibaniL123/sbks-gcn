CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/257,521 filed Mar. 15, 2013 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. TECHNICAL FIELD This disclosure relates to a putter used in the sport of golf. BACKGROUND One of the most important aspects of the game of golf is putting. A wide variety of putters have been developed over the years in an effort to provide every golfer with the putter that has the desired feel and, hopefully, produces the desired result as more one putts. Conventional putters include a putter head attached to the lower end of a shaft and a grip that is provided on the upper end of the shaft. Putter heads may be one of many types of blades or one of many widely varied types of mallets. Putters generally are provided with a shaft that is of a fixed length with a grip provided at the upper end of the shaft or provided at the upper end with an auxiliary or intermediate grip provided below the grip at the upper end. There are four accepted putting styles that are currently in use that are normally used with one of three different length putters. A standard length putter used in the standard putting style has a shaft that is approximately 800 mm to 900 mm and may be shorter for women or children or longer for taller men. A belly putter is used in the belly putting style and generally has a shaft of 950 mm to 1100 mm in length and is designed to be anchored against the stomach of a golfer. A long putter is used in the long putting style and has a shaft that is longer than 1100 mm and is designed to be anchored at the chest or chin of a golfer. A golfer using “side-saddle” putting style also may utilize the long putter. Putters are generally purchased in standard combinations of the head shaft and grip and are not adjustable or convertible in any way. If a golfer, after purchasing a standard length putter, wishes to try a belly putter or a long putter, he must purchase a completely different putter. The loft (vertical face angle) and lie angle (toe up/toe down) of the putter head are normally fixed and cannot be adjusted or calibrated. Golfers may change their putting stance so that the golf ball is struck by the putter head either forward in the stance, in the middle of the stance, or in the back of the stance. The putter face becomes more positively lofted toward the front of the putting stance and more negatively lofted toward the rear of the putting stance. The loft is determined based upon where the golf ball is to be struck by the putter or putter head. Conventional putters do not have a loft angle adjustment mechanism. Golfers may wish to stand closer to or further from the golf ball. As the point of contact of the putter head with the golf ball moves further from the golfer's feet, the lie angle of the shaft relative to the ground increases. If it is desired to strike the ball with a putter head at a location closer to the golfer's feet, the lie angle is reduced and the shaft extends upwardly at a more vertical angle. With a conventional putter, it is not possible to change the loft angle or lie angle of the putter head relative to the shaft. The putter head is normally attached to the shaft with the blade of the putter square to the direction that the ball is to be stroked. Some golfers may want to stroke the golf ball with an open-face or a closed-face or compensate for a defect in their putting stroke. However, conventional putters do not permit adjustment of the putter head relative to the shaft and grip to provide an open or closed face. This disclosure is directed to solving one or more of the above problems and other problems associated with conventional putter designs as summarized below. SUMMARY According to one aspect of this disclosure, an under the arm putter is disclosed that allows a golfer to use a long putter using a putting stance for a traditional or standard sized putter. Lodging a long putter under the armpit allows a golfer to put with a normal stance while obtaining the benefits of a long putter or belly putter preventing them from breaking their wrists while putting. According to one aspect of the present invention, an adjustable and convertible putter is provided that may be adapted for use with any of the conventional putting styles or with an underarm putting style. The putter has a head connected to the shaft with an adjustable connector that permits the lie angle and the loft angle to both be adjusted within a wide range of angular orientations. The lie angle of the putter may be adjusted to move the toe up or down. The angular orientation of the face of the putter may be adjusted to change the loft of the putter face which allows the putter to lie on the ground in a functional manner with the appropriate loft whether the putter is positioned in the front of a player's stance, the middle of the stance, or in the back of a putter's stance. The adjustable connector also allows the putter face to be adjusted to a square, open or closed orientation. According to another aspect of the invention, a connector assembly may be provided at an intermediate location on the shaft. A first portion of the connector assembly may be assembled to the lower portion of the shaft with a second portion of the connector assembly being attached to an upper portion of the shaft. The upper portion of the shaft may be provided in a length appropriate for an underarm putter, a belly putter, or a long putter. According to another aspect of the invention, the shaft may be interchanged and used with different types of putter heads. For example, if a golfer wishes to convert from a two ball putter to a mallet putter, but continues to use the same shaft and putting style (belly, standard, long putter, etc.), the shaft may be easily disconnected from one putter head and reconnected to a different putter head. According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the adjustable and convertible putter disclosed may be used as a standard putter, a belly putter, a traditional long putter, an under the arm long putter, or as a side saddle putter. With each different length and address position, the lie and loft angles may be different but with the present invention both angles may be adjusted with a single adjustment mechanism to the exact position desired by the golfer. Depending upon the position of the ball relative to the golfer's feet at address being centered, forward, or rearward, it may be necessary to adjust the loft angle (vertical face angle) of the putter head relative to the shaft. Depending on the how far the golfer chooses to stand away from the ball at address, it may be necessary to adjust the lie angle (toe up/toe down) of the putter head relative to the shaft. The putter head may also be rotated relative to the shaft to turn the head from a square position to an open or closed position. Further, according to the present invention, the shaft may be used and combined with different heads to allow a golfer to convert from a mallet putter to a two ball putter or from one mallet putter to another, or one type of putter to another as desired. According to a further aspect of this disclosure, a putter is disclosed that comprises a shaft with a grip provided on at least an upper end of the shaft. A head is connected to the shaft by a connector that includes a first part attached to the shaft and a second part connected to the head. The first part and the second part define a ball joint connection between the shaft and the head that are configured to connect the head to the shaft in a range of angular orientations to permit a lie angle and a loft angle of the head to be adjusted and fixed in a selected orientation relative to the shaft. The first part of the connector may comprise a ball end including a cylindrical stub shaft adapted to be attached to a lower end of the shaft and a spherical lower portion. The second part of the connector may further comprise a receptacle that defines a partially spherical surface and a threaded locking member that may be loosened to change an angular orientation of the head relative to the shaft and tightened to fix the angular orientation of the head relative to the shaft. The receptacle may further comprise an adapter having a plurality of fingers on an upper end that have an outer surface that form a frustum of a cone with an increasing diameter in a vertical direction. The head defines an opening that receives the adapter. A lower portion may define a threaded opening that receives the threaded locking member. The threaded locking member may be used to loosen the engagement of the fingers on the ball end by extending the adapter out of the opening.

A golfer 24 is shown in phantom line with the grip 12 of the underarm putter 10 disposed in the armpit 26 of the golfer 24. Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, a ball end 30 is provided on the shaft. A cylindrical stub shaft 32 extends from the ball end 30 and is received in the lower end of the shaft 16. An adapter is generally indicated by reference numeral 36 and defines a ball seat 38 that is a concave, partially spherical surface within the adapter 36. A plurality of fingers 40 are provided on the upper end of the adapter 36. An outer surface 42 of the fingers, in combination, form a frustum of a cone with an increasing diameter in the vertical direction. A threaded opening 44 is defined by a lower portion 46 of the adapter 36. A receptacle 48 is defined within the putter head 18. The receptacle 48 is partially defined by a tapered wall 50 that receives the outer surface 42 of the fingers 40 when the adapter 36 is assembled to the putter head 18. A cylindrical wall 52 partially defines the receptacle 48 and receives the lower portion 46 of the adapter 36 when the adapter 36 is assembled to the putter head 18. A countersink 56 is defined in the putter head 18 and extends upwardly from the bottom of the putter head 18. A screw 58, including a threaded shaft 60 and a head 62, is inserted through the countersink 56 and into the threaded opening 44 defined by the adapter 36. The screw 58 is tightened to draw the adapter 36 into the putter head 18 until the screw 58 is tightened against a shoulder 64 created by the countersink 56. As the screw 58 is tightened, the outer surface 42 of the fingers 40 are drawn downwardly into the receptacle 48 so that the fingers are forced into engagement with the ball end 30 by the tapered wall 50 thereby locking the shaft 16 to the putter head 18. To adjust the lie angle or loft angle of the putter head 18 relative to the shaft 16, the screw 58 is simply loosened and the shaft is repositioned at the desired angular orientation, and the screw 58 is then tightened. The putter head 18 may also be rotated relative to the shaft when the screw 58 is loosened and then may be locked into a particular open or closed orientation by tightening the screw 58. Referring specifically to FIG. 3, the putter head 18 is shown securely attached to the shaft 16.
