Example 4
Synthesis of 3-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)pyridine 1-oxide
In the same manner as that of Example 1, (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol (34 mg, 97 µmol), 3-carboxypyridine 1-oxide (40 mg, 0.29 mmol), triethylamine (70 µL, 0.50 mmol), and HATU (125 mg, 0.33 mmol) were reacted. To the reaction solution, a 2 N solution of ammonia in methanol was added to terminate the reaction, then the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was directly subjected to column chromatography (silica gel, 25g) using a 0.1 N solution of ammonia in methanol and chloroform (concentration gradient, 0 to 50%) as the elution solvent, and thereby purified. The obtained syrup was dissolved in methanol, then powdered by adding tert-butyl methyl ether to the solution, and then collected by filtration to obtain the title compound (14 mg, 31%) as weakly brown amorphous substance.
