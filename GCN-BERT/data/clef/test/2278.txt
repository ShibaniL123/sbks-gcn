Electronic Muscle Stimulation Apparatus and Method The present invention relates to electronic muscle stimulators. Such devices can be used for muscle rehabilitation, muscle strengthening as well as wrinkle reduction, slimming, shaping, detox applications, and toning. They operate by way of electrodes applied on the skin that apply an electric current, prompting activation of muscles local to the electrode. Electronic muscle stimulators are typically comprised of a control console to which is connected a body applicator manifold from which a number of electrodes extend for placement on a subject requiring treatment. Effective electronic muscle stimulation requires correct placement of the electrodes. In this connection, when an operator of such a known device is ready to apply the electrodes, they have generally had to rely on either printed electrode placement charts and diagrams, or pre-stored placement diagrams which are displayed when required. In the former case, these require the operator to select the correct chart in order to proceed with the relevant treatment. This is time consuming and there are moreover a limited number of such charts that are available, thereby restricting the available electrode layout configurations. Where pre-stored placement diagrams are displayed on a screen, the operator can be guided through the correct placement of such electrodes. However, in order to cover all possible eventualities of electrode placement, a vast number of placement charts would be required. As such, the actual number of charts that are stored in such an arrangement is limited to a practical number, meaning that many placements are less than optimal for a required application. The present invention seeks to alleviate such problems with known arrangements. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an electronic muscle stimulation apparatus for executing different programs of muscle stimulation, the apparatus comprising:- a graphical user interface having a display and a data input means for entering subject specific data; processing means; memory; and a plurality of electrodes for application on a subject; wherein said memory holds historical data corresponding to a plurality of predetermined electrode placement configurations appropriate to different muscle stimulation programs; wherein said processing means determines a subject electrode placing configuration based on said historical data modified to take into account subject specific data, said display showing said subject electrode placing configuration; and wherein said display shows an order of application of said electrodes. In this way, the present invention provides apparatus that can efficiently determine an electrode placement configuration that is tailored to an individual. Preferably, said electrodes each have a respective indication means providing an indication of when it is their turn to be applied. The electrodes can in this regard be accurately positioned on the subject in an optimal manner for ensuring the subject's comfort and minimising the risk of the electrodes becoming tangled. Conveniently, subject specific data comprises one or more of subject gender, subject height, subject weight, and subject age. The subject specific data may comprise the subject body mass index (BMI). Preferably, the subject specific data comprises a selection from a specific program of stimulation, said graphical user interface allowing a program selection from a plurality of different programs of stimulation. Conveniently, the subject specific data comprises a subject body area selection, said graphical user interface allowing up to five separate body areas, or all the body areas to be selected. The subject specific data further may comprise a subject priority body area selection, said graphical user interface allowing up to two body areas to be prioritised. The provision of such subject specific data allows the apparatus to modify the electrode layout configuration for an individual. Preferably, said processing means determines the number of electrodes to be allocated to each selected body area from a predetermined number of electrodes, wherein the electrodes are initially allocated equally between the selected body areas, subject to an even number of electrodes being allocated to each selected body area, with any remaining electrodes from said predetermined number of electrodes being allocated to any selected priority body areas. In this regard, the processing means divides the number of available electrodes by the selected body areas. If this is not an even number, the processing means will reduce the number of available electrodes until an even number for each selected body area is attained. In this connection, there are preferably six back body areas and five front body areas that can be selected. Conveniently, electrodes are allocated with a specific order of application, such that electrodes designated for application to the subject's back are together and fall before those designated for application to the subject's front. This ensures that a subject does not have to turn several times in the application of the electrodes. Examples of the present invention will now be described with reference to the following drawings, of which:- Figure 1 shows a perspective view of apparatus according to the present invention; Figure 2 shows schematically the main components of apparatus according to the present invention; Figure 3 shows a flow diagram schematically setting out the steps according to the present invention; and Figures 4 to 9 show displays from apparatus according to the present invention. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the apparatus comprises a control console 1 housing a power supply 2, a display 3, for example a touch screen, and a main processor memory and communications circuit 4. Power is supplied through mains power supply 5. The control console is provided within a trolley on wheels so that it can be readily positioned in proximity to a subject to be treated. The control console is furthermore in communication with a body applicator unit 6 that includes a controller and communications processor 7, an output circuit and isolating transformers 8, an LED driver circuit 9, and a number of electrodes 10. Figure 3 shows a flow diagram setting out various steps of the present invention relating to the allocating of electrodes and Figures 4 to 9 show representative displays from the display 3 at different stages of the method. In use of the device, the touch screen 3 of the general console is used to input data relating to the subject. An example input display screen is provided at Figure 4 where data specific to the user is inputted, in this case it is shown that the gender of the user needs to be chosen. The subject weight, subject height and subject age can of course be inputted in a similar fashion. Further data that can be inputted includes the type of treatment program, the areas to be treated, and any desired priority areas. This is shown as step 20 in Figure 3. The process of selecting a specific treatment is shown in Figures 5 to 9. Figures 5 and 6 show views from the graphical user interface of how the type of treatment can be selected, initially from various general types of treatment, for example body bio-stimulation, face bio-stimulation, body ultrasound, face ultrasound, micro current and multi treatment. Figure 6 shows a more specific choice on the type of treatment can be selected from, for example, slimming and shaping, toning, detox, sport and training, therapeutic and multi body. A yet further more preferred element of the type of treatment can be selected as shown in Figure 7 where a choice can be made between instant inch lost, slimming and weight loss, anti cellulite, lipolysis and post natal slimming. Figure 8 then shows where instant inch loss has been chosen. At this stage, up to five body areas may be selected and of these, up to two may be prioritised for extra attention. The touch display allows the body areas to be selected by simply touching the area on the screen, an area being prioritised by selecting it twice. Selected areas are for example numbered in blue, whereas prioritised areas may be numbered in red. Selecting an area three times causes it to be de-selected. Figure 9 shows where and in what order the electrodes, provided within pads, in this case biopads, should be positioned on the subject's body. The methodology of how the display at Figure 9 is arrived at, is described in Figure 3. In the present case, this is controlled through embedded software in the apparatus. From this initial data input at step 20, the main processor is able to calculate the body mass index (BMI) of the subject and thereby to determine the relevant body type, namely endomorph, ectomorph or mesomorph. This is identified as step 21. At step 22, a calculation is made as to how many electrodes are to be allocated to each selection area. Initially, an even number of electrodes up to the maximum allowed per area is allocated. At step 23 it is identified whether any electrodes are left to allocate and if the answer to this is "no" then the method progresses to step 26. If however, there are still electrodes which are yet to be allocated, these are then allocated to any priority areas indicated at step 20 at step 24. At step 25, it is determined whether all electrodes have been allocated or whether all areas are in fact now full. Should there still be electrodes unallocated then the method loops back to step 24 as shown. The method then progresses to step 26, where individual area layouts are reviewed based on the number of electrodes allocated, the treatment required, the gender and the body type identified previously. At step 27 electrode numbers are then allocated based on predefined body area order so that, for example, any electrodes to be attached to the back of the subject are given lower numbers, so that for example the subject only has to turn once if electrodes are being applied to both their front and back. It will be understood that the calculating and determining steps are carried out by the main processor within the control console, and this communicates with the body applicator 6 in order to drive the LED driver circuit. In this connection each electrode includes an identifier allowing it to be identified as the next electrode that needs to be applied to a certain area as indicated on the display 3 of the control console 4. Such identifiers may be flashing LED lights on respective electrodes. The main processor carries out its calculating and determining steps by way of an algorithm. This itself can be broken down into a number of steps. The first of these is that the variables are initialised, in other words, the current electrode array as well as a priority array are both zeroed. Then from the user data which has been provided, selected priority data is stored in the priority array. The algorithm cycles through all the body areas to find which area has been given priority and stores this to a top-of-priority array list. Then predefined default values are set to temporary arrays for numbering sequence and priority area based on user selection. Subsequently, an electrode layout treatment array is selected as are parameters based on user selections. In other words, the electrode layout required is determined for current treatment and its parameters depending on gender selection, body type selection and treatment selection. It will be understood that different types of treatment can be provided by the apparatus. In order to determine the positioning of the electrodes, the priority area array based on the user selection and temporary array are collated so that an electrode allocation array is created by combining the default priority areas predefined in the software and priority areas selected by the user. A calculation is then made of the number of electrodes to be allocated and ones that remain based on the number of areas that have been selected. In this respect, the number of electrode channels is divided by the number of areas selected for a particular treatment (the number of electrode allocations divided by area must be an even number in proportion). If it is not then the allocation is reduced to an even number and the number of electrodes that are unallocated is increased. A comparison is then made of a calculated number of electrodes to the actual number of electrodes available within the layout. In this connection, the selected areas are considered in turn and a comparison is made between the layout information stored for the particular area and the calculated number of electrodes for that area. If there is a difference then an electrode layout using fewer electrodes is used. Then any electrodes that are left over are carried over back into the process to be allocated to priority areas. In this regard, the priority areas are reconsidered and it is determined if any remaining electrodes can be distributed amongst these areas by using layout information stored. If any electrodes still remain, the non-priority areas are reconsidered and it is determined whether the remaining electrodes can be distributed amongst these, again using stored layout information. Finally, the allocated electrode layouts are copied into the current electrode layout array and electrodes are allocated numbers, for example, with the lower numbers allocated to the back areas of the body such that a user need only turn over once if electrodes are to be attached both to their front and back. It will be understood that variants of the above features are possible within the scope of the invention, as is defined by the appended claims. 1.
