IMIDE-BASED MODULATORS OF PROTEOLYSIS AND ASSOCIATED METHODS OF USE CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [001] This application is a International PCT Application that claims the benefit of, and priority to, U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/979,351, filed April 14, 2014, entitled “IMIDE-BASED MODULATORS OF PROTEOLYSIS AND ASSOCIATED METHODS OF USE”, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE [002] In compliance with 37 C.F.R. § 1.52(e), sequence listing information in Computer Readable Form is being submitted herewith in .txt format, file name: Sequence_Listing_ST25.txt; size 2 KB; created on: April 14, 2015 using PatentIn-3.5, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.” FIELD OF THE INVENTION [003] The description provides imide-based compounds, including bifunctional compounds comprising the same, and associated methods of use. The bifunctional compounds are useful as modulators of targeted ubiquitination, especially with respect to a variety of polypeptides and other proteins, which are degraded and/or otherwise inhibited by bifunctional compounds according to the present invention. BACKGROUND [004] Most small molecule drugs bind enzymes or receptors in tight and well-defined pockets. On the other hand, protein-protein interactions are notoriously difficult to target using small molecules due to their large contact surfaces and the shallow grooves or flat interfaces involved. E3 ubiquitin ligases (of which hundreds are known in humans) confer substrate specificity for ubiquitination, and therefore, are more attractive therapeutic targets than general proteasome inhibitors due to their specificity for certain protein substrates. The development of ligands of E3 ligases has proven challenging, in part due to the fact that they must disrupt protein-protein interactions. However, recent developments have provided specific ligands which bind to these ligases. For example, since the discovery of nutlins, the first small molecule E3 ligase inhibitors, additional compounds have been reported that target E3 ligases but the field remains underdeveloped. [005] One E3 ligase with therapeutic potential is the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor. VHL comprises the substrate recognition subunit/E3 ligase complex VCB, which includes elongins B and C, and a complex including Cullin-2 and Rbx1. The primary substrate of VHL is Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1 Į), a transcription factor that upregulates genes such as the pro-angiogenic growth factor VEGF and the red blood cell inducing cytokine erythropoietin in response to low oxygen levels. We generated the first small molecule ligands of Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) to the substrate recognition subunit of the E3 ligase, VCB, an important target in cancer, chronic anemia and ischemia2, and obtained crystal structures confirming that the compound mimics the binding mode of the transcription factor HIF-1Į, the major substrate of VHL. [006] Cereblon is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CRBN gene. CRBN orthologs are highly conserved from plants to humans, which underscores its physiological importance. Cereblon forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1), Cullin-4A (CUL4A), and regulator of cullins 1 (ROC1). This complex ubiquitinates a number of other proteins. Through a mechanism which has not been completely elucidated, cereblon ubquitination of target proteins results in increased levels of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10). FGF8 in turn regulates a number of developmental processes, such as limb and auditory vesicle formation. The net result is that this ubiquitin ligase complex is important for limb outgrowth in embryos. In the absence of cereblon, DDB1 forms a complex with DDB2 that functions as a DNA damage-binding protein. [007] Thalidomide, which has been approved for the treatment of a number of immunological indications, has also been approved for the treatment of certain neoplastic diseases, including multiple myeloma. In addition to multiple myeloma, thalidomide and several of its analogs are also currently under investigation for use in treating a variety of other types of cancer. While the precise mechanism of thalidomide’s anti-tumor activity is still emerging, it is known to inhibit angiogenesis. Recent literature discussing the biology of the imides includes Lu et al Science 343, 305 (2014) and Krönke et al Science 343, 301 (2014). [008] Significantly, thalidomide and its analogs e.g. pomolinamiode and lenalinomide, are known to bind cereblon. These agents bind to cereblon, altering the specificity of the complex to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3), transcription factors essential for multiple myeloma growth. Indeed, higher expression of cereblon has been linked to an increase in efficacy of imide drugs in the treatment of multiple myeloma. [009] An ongoing need exists in the art for effective treatments for disease, especially hyperplasias and cancers, such as multiple myeloma. However, non-specific effects, and the inability to target and modulate certain classes of proteins altogether, such as transcription factors, remain as obstacles to the development of effective anti-cancer agents. As such, small molecule therapeutic agents that leverage or potentiate cereblon’s substrate specificity and, at the same time, are“tunable” such that a wide range of protein classes can be targetted and modulated with specificity would be very useful as a therapeutic. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0010] The present disclosure describes bifunctional compounds which function to recruit endogenous proteins to an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for degradation, and methods of using the same. In particular, the present disclosure provides bifunctional or proteolysis targeting chimeric (PROTAC) compounds, which find utility as modulators of targeted ubiquitination of a variety of polypeptides and other proteins, which are then degraded and/or otherwise inhibited by the bifunctional compounds as described herein. An advantage of the compounds provided herein is that a broad range of pharmacological activities is possible, consistent with the degradation/inhibition of targeted polypeptides from virtually any protein class or family. In addition, the description provides methods of using an effective amount of the compounds as described herein for the treatment or amelioration of a disease condition, such as cancer, e.g., multiple myeloma. [0011] As such, in one aspect the disclosure provides novel imide-based compounds as described herein. [0012] In an additional aspect, the disclosure provides bifunctional or PROTAC compounds, which comprise an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase binding moiety (i.e., a ligand for an E3 Ubquitin Ligase or“ULM” group), and a moiety that binds a target protein (i.e., a protein/polypeptide targeting ligand or“PTM” group) such that the target protein/polypeptide is placed in proximity to the ubiquitin ligase to effect degradation (and inhibition) of that protein. In a preferred embodiment, the ULM is a cereblon E3 Ubiquitin Ligase binding moiety (i.e., a “CLM”). For example, the structure of the bifunctional compound can be depicted as: [0013] The respective positions of the PTM and CLM moieties as well as their number as illustrated herein is provided by way of example only and is not intended to limit the compounds in any way. As would be understood by the skilled artisan, the bifunctional compounds as described herein can be synthesized such that the number and position of the respective functional moieties can be varied as desired. [0014] In certain embodiments, the bifunctional compound further comprises a chemical linker ("L"). In this example, the structure of the bifunctional compound can be depicted as: where PTM is a protein/polypeptide targeting moiety, L is a linker, and CLM is a cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase binding moiety. [0015] In certain preferred embodiments, the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase is cereblon. As such, in certain additional embodiments, the CLM of the bifunctional compound comprises chemistries such as imide, amide, thioamide, thioimide derived moieties. In additional embodiments, the CLM comprises a phthalimido group or an analog or derivative thereof. In still additional embodiments, the CLM comprises a phthalimido-glutarimide group or an analog or derivative thereof. In still other embodiments, the CLM comprises a member of the group consisting of thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and analogs or derivatives thereof. [0016] In certain embodiments, the compounds as described herein comprise multiple CLMs, multiple PTMs, multiple chemical linkers or a combination thereof. [0017] In an additional aspect, the description provides therapeutic compositions comprising an effective amount of a compound as described herein or salt form thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The therapeutic compositions modulate protein degradation in a patient or subject, for example, an animal such as a human, and can be used for treating or ameliorating disease states or conditions which are modulated through the degraded protein. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic compositions as described herein may be used to effectuate the degradation of proteins of interest for the treatment or amelioration of a disease, e.g., cancer. In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of ubiquitinating/ degrading a target protein in a cell. In certain embodiments, the method comprises administering a bifunctional compound as described herein comprising an CLM and a PTM, preferably linked through a linker moiety, as otherwise described herein, wherein the CLM is coupled to the PTM and wherein the CLM recognizes a ubiquitin pathway protein (e.g., an ubiquitin ligase, preferably an E3 ubiquitin ligase such as, e.g., cereblon) and the PTM recognizes the target protein such that degradation of the target protein will occur when the target protein is placed in proximity to the ubiquitin ligase, thus resulting in degradation/inhibition of the effects of the target protein and the control of protein levels. The control of protein levels afforded by the present invention provides treatment of a disease state or condition, which is modulated through the target protein by lowering the level of that protein in the cells of a patient. [0018] In an additional aspect, the description provides a method for assessing (i.e., determining and/or measuring) a CLM’s binding affinity. In certain embodiments, the method comprises providing a test agent or compound of interest, for example, an agent or compound having an imide moiety, e.g., a phthalimido group, phthalimido-glutarimide group, derivatized thalidomide, derivatized lenalidomide or derivatized pomalidomide, and comparing the cereblon binding affinity and/or inhibitory activity of the test agent or compound as compared to an agent or compound known to bind and/or inhibit the activity of cereblon. [0019] In still another aspect, the description provides methods for treating or emeliorating a disease, disorder or symptom thereof in a subject or a patient, e.g., an animal such as a human, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a composition comprising an effective amount, e.g., a therapeutically effective amount, of a compound as described herein or salt form thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the composition is effective for treating or ameliorating the disease or disorder or symptom thereof in the subject.

Additional objects and advantages associated with the compositions, methods, and processes of the present invention will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the instant claims, description, and examples. For example, the various aspects and embodiments of the invention may be utilized in numerous combinations, all of which are expressly contemplated by the present description. These additional advantages objects and embodiments are expressly included within the scope of the present invention. The publications and other materials used herein to illuminate the background of the invention, and in particular cases, to provide additional details respecting the practice, are incorporated by reference. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0022] The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated into and form a part of the specification, illustrate several embodiments of the present invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention. The drawings are only for the purpose of illustrating an embodiment of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention. Further objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures showing illustrative embodiments of the invention, in which: [0023] Figure 1. Illustration of general principle for PROTAC function. (A) Exemplary PROTACs comprise a protein targeting moiety (PTM; darkly shaded rectangle), a ubiquitin ligase binding moiety (ULM; lightly shaded triangle), and optionally a linker moiety (L; black line) coupling or tethering the PTM to the ULM. (B) Illustrates the functional use of the PROTACs as described herein. Briefly, the ULM recognizes and binds to a specific E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, and the PTM binds and recruits a target protein bringing it into close proximity to the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase. Typically, the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase is complexed with an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating protein, and either alone or via the E2 protein catalyzes attachment of ubiquitin (dark circles) to a lysine on the target protein via an isopeptide bond. The poly-ubiquitinated protein (far right) is then targeted for degration by the proteosomal machinery of the cell. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0024] The following is a detailed description provided to aid those skilled in the art in practicing the present invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art may make modifications and variations in the embodiments described herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. All publications, patent applications, patents, figures and other references mentioned herein are expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety. [0025] Presently described are compositions and methods that relate to the surprising and unexpected discovery that an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase protein, e.g., cereblon, ubiquitinates a target protein once it and the target protein are placed in proximity by a bifunctional or chimeric construct that binds the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase protein and the target protein. Accordingly the present invention provides such compounds and compositions comprising an E3 Ubiquintin Ligase binding moiety (“ULM”) coupled to a protein target binding moiety (“PTM”), which result in the ubiquitination of a chosen target protein, which leads to degradation of the target protein by the proteasome (see Figure 1). The present invention also provides a library of compositions and the use thereof. [0026] Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. The terminology used in the description is for describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. [0027] Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise (such as in the case of a group containing a number of carbon atoms in which case each carbon atom number falling within the range is provided), between the upper and lower limit of that range and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range is encompassed within the invention. The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may independently be included in the smaller ranges is also encompassed within the invention, subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range. Where the stated range includes one or both of the limits, ranges excluding either both of those included limits are also included in the invention. [0028] The following terms are used to describe the present invention. In instances where a term is not specifically defined herein, that term is given an art-recognized meaning by those of ordinary skill applying that term in context to its use in describing the present invention. [0029] The articles "a" and "an" as used herein and in the appended claims are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. By way of example, "an element" means one element or more than one element. [0030] The phrase "and/or," as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be understood to mean "either or both" of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Multiple elements listed with "and/or" should be construed in the same fashion, i.e., "one or more" of the elements so conjoined. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the "and/or" clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to "A and/or B", when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as "comprising" can refer, in one embodiment, to A only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc. [0031] As used herein in the specification and in the claims, "or" should be understood to have the same meaning as "and/or" as defined above. For example, when separating items in a list, "or" or "and/or" shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally, additional unlisted items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary, such as "only one of' or "exactly one of," or, when used in the claims, "consisting of," will refer to the inclusion of exactly one element of a number or list of elements. In general, the term "or" as used herein shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e., "one or the other but not both") when preceded by terms of exclusivity, such as "either," "one of," "only one of," or "exactly one of." [0032] In the claims, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as "comprising," "including," "carrying," "having," "containing," "involving," "holding," "composed of," and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to. Only the transitional phrases "consisting of' and "consisting essentially of' shall be closed or semi-closed transitional phrases, respectively, as set forth in the United States Patent Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, Section 2111.03. [0033] As used herein in the specification and in the claims, the phrase "at least one," in reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element selected from anyone or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase "at least one" refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a nonlimiting example, "at least one of A and B" (or, equivalently, "at least one of A or B," or, equivalently "at least one of A and/or B") can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc. [0034] It should also be understood that, in certain methods described herein that include more than one step or act, the order of the steps or acts of the method is not necessarily limited to the order in which the steps or acts of the method are recited unless the context indicates otherwise. [0035] The terms "co-administration" and "co-administering" or“combination therapy” refer to both concurrent administration (administration of two or more therapeutic agents at the same time) and time varied administration (administration of one or more therapeutic agents at a time different from that of the administration of an additional therapeutic agent or agents), as long as the therapeutic agents are present in the patient to some extent, preferably at effective amounts, at the same time. In certain preferred aspects, one or more of the present compounds described herein, are coadministered in combination with at least one additional bioactive agent, especially including an anticancer agent. In particularly preferred aspects, the co-administration of compounds results in synergistic activity and/or therapy, including anticancer activity. [0036] The term“compound”, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, refers to any specific chemical compound disclosed herein and includes tautomers, regioisomers, geometric isomers, and where applicable, stereoisomers, including optical isomers (enantiomers) and other steroisomers (diastereomers) thereof, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives (including prodrug forms) thereof where applicable, in context. Within its use in context, the term compound generally refers to a single compound, but also may include other compounds such as stereoisomers, regioisomers and/or optical isomers (including racemic mixtures) as well as specific enantiomers or enantiomerically enriched mixtures of disclosed compounds. The term also refers, in context to prodrug forms of compounds which have been modified to facilitate the administration and delivery of compounds to a site of activity. It is noted that in describing the present compounds, numerous substituents and variables associated with same, among others, are described. It is understood by those of ordinary skill that molecules which are described herein are stable compounds as generally described hereunder. When the bond is shown, both a double bond and single bond are represented within the context of the compound shown. [0037] The term“Ubiquitin Ligase” refers to a family of proteins that facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin to a specific substrate protein, targeting the substrate protein for degradation. For example, cereblon is an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase protein that alone or in combination with an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme causes the attachment of ubiquitin to a lysine on a target protein, and subsequently targets the specific protein substrates for degradation by the proteasome. Thus, E3 ubiquitin ligase alone or in complex with an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme is responsible for the transfer of ubiquitin to targeted proteins. In general, the ubiquitin ligase is involved in polyubiquitination such that a second ubiquitin is attached to the first; a third is attached to the second, and so forth. Polyubiquitination marks proteins for degradation by the proteasome. However, there are some ubiquitination events that are limited to mono-ubiquitination, in which only a single ubiquitin is added by the ubiquitin ligase to a substrate molecule. Mono-ubiquitinated proteins are not targeted to the proteasome for degradation, but may instead be altered in their cellular location or function, for example, via binding other proteins that have domains capable of binding ubiquitin. Further complicating matters, different lysines on ubiquitin can be targeted by an E3 to make chains. The most common lysine is Lys48 on the ubiquitin chain. This is the lysine used to make polyubiquitin, which is recognized by the proteasome. [0038] The term“patient” or“subject” is used throughout the specification to describe an animal, preferably a human or a domesticated animal, to whom treatment, including prophylactic treatment, with the compositions according to the present invention is provided. For treatment of those infections, conditions or disease states which are specific for a specific animal such as a human patient, the term patient refers to that specific animal, including a domesticated animal such as a dog or cat or a farm animal such as a horse, cow, sheep, etc. In general, in the present invention, the term patient refers to a human patient unless otherwise stated or implied from the context of the use of the term. [0039] The term“effective” is used to describe an amount of a compound, composition or component which, when used within the context of its intended use, effects an intended result. The term effective subsumes all other effective amount or effective concentration terms, which are otherwise described or used in the present application. Compounds and Compositions [0040] In one aspect, the description provides compounds comprising an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase binding moiety (“ULM”) that is a cereblon E3 Ubiquitin Ligase binding moiety (“CLM”). In one embodiment, the CLM is coupled to a chemical linker (L) according to the structure: (I) L-CLM wherein L is a chemical linker group and CLM is a cereblon E3 Ubiquitin Ligase binding moiety. The number and/or relative positions of the moieties in the compounds illustrated herein is provided by way of example only. As would be understood by the skilled artisan, compounds as described herein can be synthesized with any desired number and/or relative position of the respective functional moieties. [0041] The terms ULM and CLM are used in their inclusive sense unless the context indicates otherwise. For example, the term ULM is inclusive of all ULMs, including those that bind cereblon (i.e., CLMs). Further, the term CLM is inclusive of all possible cereblon E3 Ubiquitin Ligase binding moieties. [0042] In another aspect, the present invention provides bifunctional or multifunctional PROTAC compounds useful for regulating protein activity by inducing the degradation of a target protein. In certain embodiments, the compound comprises a CLM coupled, e.g., linked covalently, directly or indirectly, to a moiety that binds a target protein (i.e., protein targeting moiety or“PTM”). In certain embodiments, the CLM and PTM are joined or coupled via a chemical linker (L). The CLM recognizes the cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase and the PTM recognizes a target protein and the interaction of the respective moieties with their targets facilitates the degradation of the target protein by placing the target protein in proximity to the ubiquitin ligase protein. An exemplary bifunctional compound can be depicted as: (II) PTM-CLM [0043] In certain embodiments, the bifunctional compound further comprises a chemical linker (“L”). For example, the bifunctional compound can be depicted as: (III) PTM-L-CLM wherein PTM is a protein/polypeptide targeting moiety, L is a linker, and CLM is a cereblon E3 ligase binding moiety. [0044] In certain embodiments, the compounds as described herein comprise multiple PTMs (targeting the same or different protein targets), multiple CLMs, one or more ULMs (i.e., moieties that bind specifically to another E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, e.g., VHL) or a combination thereof. In any of the aspects of embodiments described herein, the PTMs, CLMs, and ULMs can be coupled directly or via one or more chemical linkers or a combination thereof. In additional embodiments, where a compound has multiple ULMs, the ULMs can be for the same E3 Ubiquintin Ligase or each respective ULM can bind specifically to a different E3 Ubiquitin Ligase. In still further embodiments, where a compound has multiple PTMs, the PTMs can bind the same target protein or each respective PTM can bind specifically to a different target protein. [0045] In another embodiment, the description provides a compound which comprises a plurality of CLMs coupled directly or via a chemical linker moiety (L). For example, a compound having two CLMs can be depicted as: (IV) CLM-CLM or (V) CLM-L-CLM [0046] In certain embodiments, where the compound comprises multiple CLMs, the CLMs are identical. In additional embodiments, the compound comprising a plurality of CLMs further comprises at least one PTM coupled to a CLM directly or via a chemical linker (L) or both. In certain additional embodiments, the compound comprising a plurality of CLMs further comprises multiple PTMs. In still additional embodiments, the PTMs are the same or, optionally, different. In still further embodiments, wherein the PTMs are different the respective PTMs may bind the same protein target or bind specifically to a different protein target. [0047] In additional embodiments, the description provides a compound comprising at least two different CLMs coupled directly or via a chemical linker (L) or both. For example, such a compound having two different CLMs can be depicted as: (VI) CLM-CLM’ or (VII) CLM-L-CLM’ wherein CLM’ indicates a cereblon E3 Ubiquitin Ligase binding moiety that is structurally different from CLM. In certain embodiments, the compound may comprise a plurality of CLMs and/or a plurality of CLM’s. In further embodiments, the compound comprising at least two different CLMs, a plurality of CLMs, and/or a plurality of CLM’s further comprises at least one PTM coupled to a CLM or a CLM’ directly or via a chemical linker or both. In any of the embodiments described herein, a compound comprising at least two different CLMs can further comprise multiple PTMs. In still additional embodiments, the PTMs are the same or, optionally, different. In still further embodiments, wherein the PTMs are different the respective PTMs may bind the same protein target or bind specifically to a different protein target. In still further embodiments, the PTM itself is a ULM or CLM (or ULM’ or CLM’). [0048] In a preferred embodiment, the CLM comprises a moiety that is a ligand of the cereblon E3 Ubiquitin Ligase (CRBN). In certain embodiments, the CLM comprises a chemotype from the“imide” class of of molecules. In certain additional embodiments, the CLM comprises a phthalimido group or an analog or derivative thereof. In still additional embodiments, the CLM comprises a phthalimido-glutarimide group or an analog or derivative thereof. In still other embodiments, the CLM comprises a member of the group consisting of thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and analogs or derivatives thereof. [0049] In additional embodiments, the description provides the compounds as described herein including their enantiomers, diastereomers, solvates and polymorphs, including pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms thereof, e.g., acid and base salt forms.

[0077] In certain embodiments, e.g., where q is greater than 2, Aq is a group which is connected to a ULM or ULM’ moiety, and A1 and Aq are connected via structural units of A (number of such structural units of A: q-2). [0078] In certain embodiments, e.g., where q is 2, Aq is a group which is connected to A1 and to a ULM or ULM’ moiety. [0079] In certain embodiments, e.g., where q is 1, the structure of the linker group L is–A1–, and A1 is a group which is connected to a ULM or ULM’ moiety and a PTM moiety.

In certain embodiments, the linker is substituted with an aryl, phenyl, benzyl, alkyl, alkylene, or heterocycle group. In certain embodiments, the linker may be asymmetric or symmetrical. [0083] In any of the embodiments of the compounds described herein, the linker group may be any suitable moiety as described herein.

[0084] Although the CLM (or ULM) group and PTM group may be covalently linked to the linker group through any group which is appropriate and stable to the chemistry of the linker, in preferred aspects of the present invention, the linker is independently covalently bonded to the CLM group and the PTM group preferably through an amide, ester, thioester, keto group, carbamate (urethane), carbon or ether, each of which groups may be inserted anywhere on the CLM group and PTM group to provide maximum binding of the CLM group on the ubiquitin ligase and the PTM group on the target protein to be degraded. (It is noted that in certain aspects where the PTM group is a ULM group, the target protein for degradation may be the ubiquitin ligase itself). In certain preferred aspects, the linker may be linked to an optionally substituted alkyl, alkylene, alkene or alkyne group, an aryl group or a heterocyclic group on the CLM and/or PTM groups. Exemplary PTMs [0085] In preferred aspects of the invention, the PTM group is a group, which binds to target proteins. Targets of the PTM group are numerous in kind and are selected from proteins that are expressed in a cell such that at least a portion of the sequences is found in the cell and may bind to a PTM group. The term“protein” includes oligopeptides and polypeptide sequences of sufficient length that they can bind to a PTM group according to the present invention. Any protein in a eukaryotic system or a microbial system, including a virus, bacteria or fungus, as otherwise described herein, are targets for ubiquitination mediated by the compounds according to the present invention. Preferably, the target protein is a eukaryotic protein. In certain aspects, the protein binding moiety is a haloalkane (preferably a C1-C10 alkyl group which is substituted with at least one halo group, preferably a halo group at the distal end of the alkyl group (i.e., away from the linker or CLM group), which may covalently bind to a dehalogenase enzyme in a patient or subject or in a diagnostic assay. [0086] PTM groups according to the present invention include, for example, include any moiety which binds to a protein specifically (binds to a target protein) and includes the following non-limiting examples of small molecule target protein moieties: Hsp90 inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, HDM2 & MDM2 inhibitors, compounds targeting Human BET Bromodomain-containing proteins, HDAC inhibitors, human lysine methyltransferase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, nuclear hormone receptor compounds, immunosuppressive compounds, and compounds targeting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), among numerous others. The compositions described below exemplify some of the members of these nine types of small molecule target protein binding moieties. Such small molecule target protein binding moieties also include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, enantiomers, solvates and polymorphs of these compositions, as well as other small molecules that may target a protein of interest. These binding moieties are linked to the ubiquitin ligase binding moiety preferably through a linker in order to present a target protein (to which the protein target moiety is bound) in proximity to the ubiquitin ligase for ubiquitination and degradation. [0087] Any protein, which can bind to a protein target moiety or PTM group and acted on or degraded by an ubiquitin ligase is a target protein according to the present invention. In general, target proteins may include, for example, structural proteins, receptors, enzymes, cell surface proteins, proteins pertinent to the integrated function of a cell, including proteins involved in catalytic activity, aromatase activity, motor activity, helicase activity, metabolic processes (anabolism and catrabolism), antioxidant activity, proteolysis, biosynthesis, proteins with kinase activity, oxidoreductase activity, transferase activity, hydrolase activity, lyase activity, isomerase activity, ligase activity, enzyme regulator activity, signal transducer activity, structural molecule activity, binding activity (protein, lipid carbohydrate), receptor activity, cell motility, membrane fusion, cell communication, regulation of biological processes, development, cell differentiation, response to stimulus, behavioral proteins, cell adhesion proteins, proteins involved in cell death, proteins involved in transport (including protein transporter activity, nuclear transport, ion transporter activity, channel transporter activity, carrier activity, permease activity, secretion activity, electron transporter activity, pathogenesis, chaperone regulator activity, nucleic acid binding activity, transcription regulator activity, extracellular organization and biogenesis activity, translation regulator activity. Proteins of interest can include proteins from eurkaryotes and prokaryotes including humans as targets for drug therapy, other animals, including domesticated animals, microbials for the determination of targets for antibiotics and other antimicrobials and plants, and even viruses, among numerous others. [0088] In still other embodiments, the PTM group is a haloalkyl group, wherein said alkyl group generally ranges in size from about 1 or 2 carbons to about 12 carbons in length, often about 2 to 10 carbons in length, often about 3 carbons to about 8 carbons in length, more often about 4 carbons to about 6 carbons in length. The haloalkyl groups are generally linear alkyl groups (although branched-chain alkyl groups may also be used) and are end-capped with at least one halogen group, preferably a single halogen group, often a single chloride group. Haloalkyl PT, groups for use in the present invention are preferably represented by the chemical structure–(CH2)v-Halo where v is any integer from 2 to about 12, often about 3 to about 8, more often about 4 to about 6. Halo may be any halogen, but is preferably Cl or Br, more often Cl. [0089] In another embodiment, the present invention provides a library of compounds. The library comprises more than one compound wherein each composition has a formula of A-B, wherein A is a ubiquitin pathway protein binding moiety (preferably, an E3 ubiquitin ligase moiety as otherwise disclosed herein) and B is a protein binding member of a molecular library, wherein A is coupled (preferably, through a linker moiety) to B, and wherein the ubiquitin pathway protein binding moiety recognizes an ubiquitin pathway protein, in particular, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, such as cereblon. In a particular embodiment, the library contains a specific cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase binding moiety bound to random target protein binding elements (e.g., a chemical compound library). As such, the target protein is not determined in advance and the method can be used to determine the activity of a putative protein binding element and its pharmacological value as a target upon degradation by ubiquitin ligase. [0090] The present invention may be used to treat a number of disease states and/or conditions, including any disease state and/or condition in which proteins are dysregulated and where a patient would benefit from the degradation of proteins.

For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents may also be added. [00198] Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions as described herein may be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These can be prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating excipient, which is solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols. [00199] The pharmaceutical compositions as described herein may also be administered topically. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs. Topical application for the lower intestinal tract can be effected in a rectal suppository formulation (see above) or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-acceptable transdermal patches may also be used. [00200] For topical applications, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one or more carriers. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. In certain preferred aspects of the invention, the compounds may be coated onto a stent which is to be surgically implanted into a patient in order to inhibit or reduce the likelihood of occlusion occurring in the stent in the patient. [00201] Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream containing the active components suspended or dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2- octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. [00202] For ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with our without a preservative such as benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum. [00203] The pharmaceutical compositions as described herein may also be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents. [00204] The amount of compound in a pharmaceutical composition as described herein that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host and disease treated, the particular mode of administration. Preferably, the compositions should be formulated to contain between about 0.05 milligram to about 750 milligrams or more, more preferably about 1 milligram to about 600 milligrams, and even more preferably about 10 milligrams to about 500 milligrams of active ingredient, alone or in combination with at least one other compound according to the present invention. [00205] It should also be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating physician and the severity of the particular disease or condition being treated. [00206] A patient or subject in need of therapy using compounds according to the methods described herein can be treated by administering to the patient (subject) an effective amount of the compound according to the present invention including pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or polymorphs, thereof optionally in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent, either alone, or in combination with other known erythopoiesis stimulating agents as otherwise identified herein. [00207] These compounds can be administered by any appropriate route, for example, orally, parenterally, intravenously, intradermally, subcutaneously, or topically, including transdermally, in liquid, cream, gel, or solid form, or by aerosol form. [00208] The active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent in an amount sufficient to deliver to a patient a therapeutically effective amount for the desired indication, without causing serious toxic effects in the patient treated. A preferred dose of the active compound for all of the herein-mentioned conditions is in the range from about 10 ng/kg to 300 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 100 mg/kg per day, more generally 0.5 to about 25 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient/patient per day. A typical topical dosage will range from 0.01-5% wt/wt in a suitable carrier. [00209] The compound is conveniently administered in any suitable unit dosage form, including but not limited to one containing less than 1mg, 1 mg to 3000 mg, preferably 5 to 500 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form. An oral dosage of about 25-250 mg is often convenient. [00210] The active ingredient is preferably administered to achieve peak plasma concentrations of the active compound of about 0.00001-30 mM, preferably about 0.1-30 M. This may be achieved, for example, by the intravenous injection of a solution or formulation of the active ingredient, optionally in saline, or an aqueous medium or administered as a bolus of the active ingredient. Oral administration is also appropriate to generate effective plasma concentrations of active agent. [00211] The concentration of active compound in the drug composition will depend on absorption, distribution, inactivation, and excretion rates of the drug as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. It is to be noted that dosage values will also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition. The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at varying intervals of time. [00212] Oral compositions will generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They may be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound or its prodrug derivative can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. [00213] The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a dispersing agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to material of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. In addition, dosage unit forms can contain various other materials which modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example, coatings of sugar, shellac, or enteric agents. [00214] The active compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be administered as a component of an elixir, suspension, syrup, wafer, chewing gum or the like. A syrup may contain, in addition to the active compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and colorings and flavors. [00215] The active compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can also be mixed with other active materials that do not impair the desired action, or with materials that supplement the desired action, such as erythropoietin stimulating agents, including EPO and darbapoietin alfa, among others. In certain preferred aspects of the invention, one or more compounds according to the present invention are coadministered with another bioactive agent, such as an erythropoietin stimulating agent or a would healing agent, including an antibiotic, as otherwise described herein. [00216] Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, subcutaneous, or topical application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The parental preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. [00217] If administered intravenously, preferred carriers are physiological saline or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). [00218] In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. [00219] Liposomal suspensions may also be pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). For example, liposome formulations may be prepared by dissolving appropriate lipid(s) (such as stearoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine, stearoyl phosphatidyl choline, arachadoyl phosphatidyl choline, and cholesterol) in an inorganic solvent that is then evaporated, leaving behind a thin film of dried lipid on the surface of the container. An aqueous solution of the active compound are then introduced into the container. The container is then swirled by hand to free lipid material from the sides of the container and to disperse lipid aggregates, thereby forming the liposomal suspension. Therapeutic Methods [00220] In an additional aspect, the description provides therapeutic compositions comprising an effective amount of a compound as described herein or salt form thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The therapeutic compositions modulate protein degradation in a patient or subject, for example, an animal such as a human, and can be used for treating or ameliorating disease states or conditions which are modulated through the degraded protein. [00221] The terms“treat”,“treating”, and“treatment”, etc., as used herein, refer to any action providing a benefit to a patient for which the present compounds may be administered, including the treatment of any disease state or condition which is modulated through the protein to which the present compounds bind. Disease states or conditions, including cancer, which may be treated using compounds according to the present invention are set forth hereinabove. [00222] The description provides therapeutic compositions as described herein for effectuating the degradation of proteins of interest for the treatment or amelioration of a disease, e.g., cancer. In certain additional embodiments, the disease is multiple myeloma. As such, in another aspect, the description provides a method of ubiquitinating/ degrading a target protein in a cell. In certain embodiments, the method comprises administering a bifunctional compound as described herein comprising, e.g., a CLM and a PTM, preferably linked through a linker moiety, as otherwise described herein, wherein the CLM is coupled to the PTM and wherein the CLM recognizes a ubiquitin pathway protein (e.g., an ubiquitin ligase, preferably an E3 ubiquitin ligase such as, e.g., cereblon) and the PTM recognizes the target protein such that degradation of the target protein will occur when the target protein is placed in proximity to the ubiquitin ligase, thus resulting in degradation/inhibition of the effects of the target protein and the control of protein levels. The control of protein levels afforded by the present invention provides treatment of a disease state or condition, which is modulated through the target protein by lowering the level of that protein in the cell, e.g., cell of a patient. In certain embodiments, the method comprises administering an effective amount of a compound as described herein, optionally including a pharamaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, adjuvant, another bioactive agent or combination thereof. [00223] In additional embodiments, the description provides methods for treating or emeliorating a disease, disorder or symptom thereof in a subject or a patient, e.g., an animal such as a human, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a composition comprising an effective amount, e.g., a therapeutically effective amount, of a compound as described herein or salt form thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, adjuvant, another bioactive agent or combination thereof, wherein the composition is effective for treating or ameliorating the disease or disorder or symptom thereof in the subject. [00224] In another aspect, the description provides methods for identifying the effects of the degradation of proteins of interest in a biological system using compounds according to the present invention. [00225] In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of treating a human patient in need for a disease state or condition modulated through a protein where the degradation of that protein will produce a therapeutic effect in that patient, the method comprising administering to a patient in need an effective amount of a compound according to the present invention, optionally in combination with another bioactive agent. The disease state or condition may be a disease caused by a microbial agent or other exogenous agent such as a virus, bacteria, fungus, protozoa or other microbe or may be a disease state, which is caused by overexpression of a protein, which leads to a disease state and/or condition [00226] The term“disease state or condition” is used to describe any disease state or condition wherein protein dysregulation (i.e., the amount of protein expressed in a patient is elevated) occurs and where degradation of one or more proteins in a patient may provide beneficial therapy or relief of symptoms to a patient in need thereof. In certain instances, the disease state or condition may be cured.

[00235] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is used throughout the specification to describe, where applicable, a salt form of one or more of the compounds described herein which are presented to increase the solubility of the compound in the gastic juices of the patient's gastrointestinal tract in order to promote dissolution and the bioavailability of the compounds. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases and acids, where applicable. Suitable salts include those derived from alkali metals such as potassium and sodium, alkaline earth metals such as calcium, magnesium and ammonium salts, among numerous other acids and bases well known in the pharmaceutical art. Sodium and potassium salts are particularly preferred as neutralization salts of the phosphates according to the present invention. [00236] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" is used throughout the specification to describe any pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug form (such as an ester, amide other prodrug group), which, upon administration to a patient, provides directly or indirectly the present compound or an active metabolite of the present compound. General Synthetic Approach [00237] The synthetic realization and optimization of the bifunctional molecules as described herein may be approached in a step-wise or modular fashion. For example, identification of compounds that bind to the target molecules can involve high or medium throughput screening campaigns if no suitable ligands are immediately available. It is not unusual for initial ligands to require iterative design and optimization cycles to improve suboptimal aspects as identified by data from suitable in vitro and pharmacological and/or ADMET assays. Part of the optimization/SAR campaign would be to probe positions of the ligand that are tolerant of substitution and that might be suitable places on which to attach the linker chemistry previously referred to herein. Where crystallographic or NMR structural data are available, these can be used to focus such a synthetic effort. [00238] In a very analogous way one can identify and optimize ligands for an E3 Ligase, i.e. ULMs/CLMs. [00239] With PTMs and ULMs (e.g. CLMs) in hand one skilled in the art can use known synthetic methods for their combination with or without a linker moiety. Linker moieties can be synthesized with a range of compositions, lengths and flexibility and functionalized such that the PTM and ULM groups can be attached sequentially to distal ends of the linker. Thus a library of bifunctional molecules can be realized and profiled in in vitro and in vivo pharmacological and ADMET/PK studies. As with the PTM and ULM groups, the final bifunctional molecules can be subject to iterative design and optimization cycles in order to identify molecules with desirable properties. [00240] Some non-limiting exemplary methods to generate the CLMs as described herein are summarized as shown below. 2 83 [00241] As shown in representative reaction 1, dimethyl phthalate derivatives can be condensed with glutamine (racemate or enantiomer) or glutamine analogs then further reacted with agents such as carbonyl diimidazole to form 2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3- dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3-dione derivatives. [00242] Alternatively as shown in representative reaction 2, the intermediate phthalimide produced in the initial condensation described above may be separately prepared and/or isolated and then reacted with dehydrating agents such as trifluoroacetamide, POCl3 or acetic anhydride to form the desired 2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H- isoindole-1,3-dione derivatives. The same type of intermediate phthalimide can also be reacted with Lawesson’s reagent prior to the dehydration step to provide thio analogs such as that shown in representative reactions 8 and 9. [00243] Protected examples of 2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole- 1,3-dione derivatives such as the N1-BOC species shown in representative example 3 can be deprotected to reveal the target 2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3- dione derivatives by using, in this case, reagents such as TFA or silica. [00244] Phthalic anhydrides such as that shown in representative example 4 can be ring-opened by reaction with amines such as 3-aminopiperidine-2,6-dione to form an intermediate carboxylate species, that on treatment with carbonyldiimidazole and benzotriazole will form the target 2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3- dione derivatives. Alternatively, the two components may be combined in the presence of acetic acid to provide desired product as shown in representative reaction 13. [00245] In an analogous reaction, anhydride derivatives like those shown in representative reaction 5 may be reacted with amines (ammonia in the example shown) then carbonyldiimidazoleto form the desired 2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H- isoindole-1,3-dione derivatives. [00246] Where phthaloyl chlorides are available, direct condensation with glutamine (racemate or enantiomer) or glutamine analogs is possible, followed by further reaction with agents such as carbonyl diimidazole to form 2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H- isoindole-1,3-dione derivatives as shown in representative reaction 6. [00247] o-Bromobenzamides can be reacted with a source of CO such as the acid chloride shown in representative reaction 7 in the presence of a palladium catalyst and associated phosphine ligand to produce the desired 2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro- 1H-isoindole-1,3-dione derivatives. Alternatively CO gas itself may be used in conjunction with rhodium (II) catalysts and silver carbonate to provide the desired products. [00248] 2-(2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidin-5-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3- dione, and 5-(1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-2-yl)-1,3-diazinane-2,4,6-trione derivatives can be prepared by analogous means to some of the methods described above for 2-(2,6- dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3-dione derivatives. In representative reactions 20 and 21, a phthalic anhydride can be reacted with 5-amino-1,2,3,4- tetrahydropyrimidine-2,4-dione or 5-amino-1,3-diazinane-2,4,6-trione derivatives, respectively, in the presence of acetic acid to form the desired products. [00249] Alternatively, 5-(1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-2-yl)-1,3-diazinane- 2,4,6-trione derivatives can be prepared by reaction of 5-amino-1,3-diazinane-2,4,6-trione derivatives with phthalic acid mono tert-butyl esters in the presence of Hünig’s base, a carbodiimide and benzotriazole as shown in representative reaction 12. Similar conditions can be employed for the preparation of 2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H- isoindole-1,3-dione derivatives from phthalic acid mono tert-butyl esters as shown in representative reaction 14. [00250] Compounds such as 3-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-1,2,3,4- tetrahydroquinazoline-2,4-dione can be prepared from anthranilic acid derivatives by reaction of 3-aminopiperidine-2,6-diones with a carbodiimide as in representative reaction 16. The intermediate benzamide product may be isolated (or separately produced) and further reacted with a carbodiimide to produce 3-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazoline- 2,4-dione derivatives as shown in representative reaction 15. [00251] 3-(2,6-Dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,3-benzoxazine-2,4-dione analogs can be prepared by activation of salicylic acids with chloroformates then condensation with 3-aminopiperidine-2,6-diones as shown in representative reaction 17. [00252] 3,3ǦDichloroǦ2,1 6 -b-enzoxathioleǦ1,1Ǧdiones as shown in representative reaction 18 can be prepared by reaction of 2-sulfobenzoic acids with POCl3 and PCl5. These compounds can be reacted with amino derivatives to produce, for example, desired 2-(2,6- dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1Ǌ6,2-benzothiazole-1,1,3-trione derivatives. [00253] As shown in representative reaction 19, anions of saccharin derivatives can be alkylated with electrophiles such as the 3-bromo-3-methylpiperidin-2-one to produce targeted 2-(3-methyl-2-oxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1Ǌ6,2-benzothiazole-1,1,3-trione derivatives. [00254] Analogs of 2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1Ǌ6,2-benzothiazole- 1,1,3-trione may also be prepared by reaction of methyl 2-[(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3- yl)sulfamoyl]benzoate with strong bases such as sodium hydride (see representative reaction 20). [00255] Deprotonation of 2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-1,3,dione derivatives with sodium ethoxide then reaction with electrophiles such as 3-bromopiperidin-2,6-dione affords 3-(2-methyl-1,3-dioxo-1H-inden-2-yl)piperidine-2,6-dione as shown in representative reaction 21. [00256] Preparation of N1-substituted compounds such as 2-[1-(benzyloxy)-2,6- dioxopiperidin-3-yl]-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,4-dione (representative reaction 22) can be achieved by reaction of 2-(1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-2-yl)pentanedioic acid with N- benzylhydroxylamine and with trifluoroacetic anhydride. [00257] In turn molecules such as 2-[1-(benzyloxy)-2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl]-2,3- dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,4-dione (representative reaction 23) maybe subject to benzyl removal under hydrogenation conditions to yield N1-hydroxy analogs such as 2-(1-hydroxy- 2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3-dione. [00258] In representative reaction 24, methyl 1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-2- carboxylate (and analogs) is reacted with 3-aminopiperidin-2-one to provide 2-(2- oxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3-diones. [00259] The same amine can also be reacted with phthalic anhydride derivatives in the presence of a Lewis acid such as zinc bromide and trimethylsilyl ether to yield the same type of product as shown in representative reaction 25. Intermediate products from this reaction if isolated or otherwise prepared (representative reaction 26) can be pushed to full cyclization through use of a dehydrating agent. [00260] The isomeric derivatives such as 2-(6-oxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H- isoindole-1,3-dione shown in representative reaction 27 are attainable through reaction of phthalic acid with 5-aminopiperidin-2-one. [00261] Preparation of N1-substituted compounds such as 2-(1-benzyl-2,6- dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,4-dione (representative reactions 28 and 29) can be achieved through multiple routes. For example the anhydride (2-(2,6-dioxooxan-3-yl)- 2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3-dione) can be condensed with 3-aminopiperidine-2,6-dione in the presence of DMAP and carbonyldiimidazole (representative reaction 28), or 2-(2,6- dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3-dione derivatives can be alkylated with electrophiles such as benzyl bromide in the presence of base as shown in representative reaction 29. [00262] In some instances, protecting group strategies and/or functional group interconversions (FGIs) may be required to facilitate the preparation of the desired materials. Such chemical processes are well known to the synthetic organic chemist and many of these may be found in texts such as“Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis” Peter G. M. Wuts and Theodora W. Greene (Wiley), and “Organic Synthesis: The Disconnection Approach” Stuart Warren and Paul Wyatt (Wiley).

EXAMPLES A. Assays 1. CRBN assay - Cloning, expression and purification of human CRBN and DDB1 [00266] The proceedure is standard to one versed in the art, as typified by the description in Lopez-Girona et al. (Cereblon is a direct protein target for immunomodulatory and antiproliferative activities of lenalidomide and pomalidomide, A Lopez-Girona, D Mendy, T Ito, K Miller, A K Gandhi, J Kang, S Karasawa, G Carmel, P Jackson, M Abbasian, A Mahmoudi, B Cathers, E Rychak, S Gaidarova, R Chen, P H Schafer, H Handa, T O Daniel, J F Evans and R Chopra, Leukemia 26: 2326-2335, 2012). [00267] The cDNAs for the CRBN and DDB1 genes can be amplified by PCR using Pfusion (NEB) as the polymerase and the following primer sequences: [00268] CRBN can be cloned into pBV-ZZ-HT-LIC, pBV-GST-LIC, pMA-HT-LIC, and DDB1 into pBV-notag-LIC, using ligation-independent cloning 26. For cloning into the mammalian vector pMA-HT-LIC, the CRBN-Flag-Reverse oligo adds a C-terminal FLAG tag for immunodetection. The DDB1-Rev adds a StrepTag 27. A ZZ-tag 28 is necessary to achieve high expression of soluble CRBN; without it, the His-CRBN expressed at low level, while a GST-CRBN results in aggregated protein. Recombinant baculovirus of ZZ-His- CRBN and DDB1-StrepTag (ST) are generated and amplified using Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system from Invitrogen in Sf9 insect cells. ZZ-His-CRBN and DDB1-ST are co- expressed in High Five (Tni) insect in 10L wave bags at 27 ºC using un-supplemented ESF921 media from Expression Systems. Cells are harvested 48 hours post infection by centrifugation and paste re-suspended in PBS plus5X Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). [00269] All subsequent protein purification steps are carried out at 4 ºC. Frozen cells are thawed, resuspended in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT ) plus 20 mM imidazole and protease inhibitors, lysed and centrifuged to yield a clear supernatant. The CRBN-DDB1 is purified on a ÄKTA-xpress system (GE Healthcare) using a Nickel-Sepharose and S200 Sephacryl chromatography. The complex is then further purified using anion exchange chromatography on an 8 ml MonoQ column and a second pass on a S-200 gel filtration. CRBN-DDB1 is identified by SDS- PAGE and the CRBN-DDB1 containing fractions were pooled and stored at -70 ºC. 2.
