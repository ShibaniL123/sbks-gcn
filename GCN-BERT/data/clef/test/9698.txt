Example 16. Preparation of PAG-6
A 100 mL flask was charged with 1,1-difluoro-2-oxo-2-(phenylamino)ethane-1-sulfonyl fluoride (SM-1) (1.36 g, 5.34 mmol, 1.0 eq.), 2-Hydroxy-2'-trifluoromethylacetophenone (SM-8) (1.09 g, 5.34 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and THF (27 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −50° C. n-BuLi (1.6 M, 3.3 mL, 5.34 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added dropwise to the mixture over 10 minutes. The mixture was stirred for 3 hours at −50° C. to 10° C. 1N HCl (27 mL) was added to the final reaction mixture and then AcOEt (81 mL) was added. The upper layer was separated and washed with 1N HCl (27 mL) and brine (27 mL). The solution was subsequently dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. Solvents were removed in an evaporator and the crude product was purified by column chromatography (hexane/AcOEt) twice and recrystallization (hexane/CHCl3, 50° C. to 0° C.) to obtain the target PAG as pale yellow solid (0.32 g) in 13.7% yield.
