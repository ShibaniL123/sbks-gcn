Step 2
Methyl 2-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoro-acetamido)-2H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate
Methyl 4-amino-2-methyl-2H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate (3.00 g, 19.3 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), trifluoroacetic anhydride (4.47 g, 21.3 mmol) was added dropwise under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes, and quenched with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (30 mL), and extracted with dichloromethane (50 mL x 2). The organic phases were combined, washed with brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to give methyl 2-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoro-acetamido)-2H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate (4.2 g, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 86%. MS-ESI calcd. [M + H]+ 252, found 252.
