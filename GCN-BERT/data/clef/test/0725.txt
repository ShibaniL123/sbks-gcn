The inventors have found that the glycerol carbonic esters, when they are brought into contact with plants ■■■■ especially but not exclusively with the parts of plants above the soil -- on the one hand do not impair the growth and development of the plants and on the other hand even have numerous advantages as agricultural inputs. In particular they do not damage the cuticle of the leaves of the plants and do not cause burning of the plants when they are applied to the parts of plants above the soil. The glycerol carbonic esters are suitable for application to plants and comply with environmental protection and conservation standards. They are not in themselves toxic to human or animal health. They are biodegradable, they do not present any risk of accumulating in the soil and of contaminating or damaging the environment when they are applied to plants and/or introduced into the soil - for example by being washed in by rainwater or by watering ■■■■ and by runoff. The glycerol carbonic esters can be "biosourced", that is to say obtained from inexpensive and renewable natural resources - especially from plant resources. They therefore have a low cost price and can be applied economically in the open field to plants. Furthermore, they have properties of supplementing and improving the efficiency of active substances. As such, they can allow the doses of such active substances which are to be applied to plant crops and in the environment to be reduced and contribute to the conservation of that environment. In an embodiment of a method for the treatment of plants according to the invention there is applied to plants a treatment composition comprising at least one glycerol carbonic ester and optionally a "phyto-acceptable" excipient, that is to say an excipient which is compatible with its application to plants and is acceptable to plants.

At least one glycerol carbonic ester - especially such a treatment composition - can be applied to plants at the stage of seeds, or to plants at the stage of plantlets, that is to say to a young plant that has only a limited number of leaves, or to juvenile plants -- especially to plants at a stage preceding flowering, ■■■■ or to plants during flowering (before, during or after pollination), or to plants after fertilization, or to plants during fruiting. It is also possible to apply at least one glycerol carbonic ester - especially such a treatment composition - in the plant cultivation substrate - for example in the soil ■■■■ so as to permit contact of at least one glycerol carbonic ester -- especially of such a treatment composition - with the underground parts -- especially, for example, the roots, the rhizomes, the tubers ■■■■ of the plants.

The invention accordingly relates in particular to a method for the treatment of plants comprising the application of at least one glycerol carbonic ester in association with at least one plant nutritive agent. The application of at least one glycerol carbonic ester can be carried out separately from the application of at least one other such active (especially nutritive) agent ■■■■ in particular with distinct treatment compositions applied simultaneously or, on the contrary, in succession. Advantageously and according to the invention, the application of at least one glycerol carbonic ester can be carried out at the same time as the application of at least one other such active (in particular nutritive) agent - in particular by application of the same treatment, especially nutritive, composition.

Nutritive treatment / fertilization Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of at least one glycerol carbonic ester - especially at least one glycerol carbonic ester of formula (I), (I'), (VIII), (IX) or (X) - in a nutritive treatment, in particular for controlling the growth and/or the of plants, especially by fertilization and/or by application to the plants. Accordingly, the invention relates to a nutritive treatment method for plants. The invention relates in particular to a nutritive treatment method for plants which comprises applying at least one glycerol carbonic ester -- especially a nutritive composition. According to the invention, a nutritive composition is applied to plants in any of their stages of growth and/or development. Advantageously and according to the invention, there is applied in contact with plants a nutritive composition comprising at least one glycerol carbonic ester and at least one solid in the divided state comprising at least one compound chosen from the group formed of nutritive elements of plants. Advantageously, a nutritive composition comprising at least one glycerol carbonic ester and at least one nutritive treatment agent for plants other than a glycerol carbonic ester is applied .

A nutritive composition according to the invention can be in any form appropriate to its administration in contact with plants and/or their substrate, especially in the form of granules, powder, liquid solution or suspension for spreading or spraying, or the like. The invention relates in particular to the use of at least one glycerol carbonic ester especially of a nutritive composition comprising at least one glycerol carbonic ester - for the nutritive treatment of plants by direct application to parts of the plants above the soil and/or to underground parts of the plants. Advantageously, a nutritive composition comprising at least one glycerol carbonic ester and at least one nutritive element of plants other than a glycerol carbonic ester is applied. The nutritive composition according to the invention is advantageously chosen to be able to permit the release of at least one nutritive element through the cuticle of plants. Advantageously and according to the invention, the nutritive composition is applied to at least a part of the plants that is above the soil - especially to at least a part of the foliage of the plants. A nutritive composition according to the invention is suitable in particular for application to the parts of the plants that are above the soil. For example, a liquid nutritive composition is applied by fogging (by means of an atomizer). In particular, the nutritive composition according to the invention can be applied especially to vegetable plants or to ornamental plants in cultivation. The nutritive composition according to the invention can thus be used especially in horticulture. The inventors have observed that a nutritive composition comprising at least one glycerol carbonic ester surprisingly improves the assimilation of nutritive elements by the plant. Without being bound by this possible explanation, this assimilation may arise owing to the fact that a glycerol carbonic ester allows the interactions of droplets of the nutritive composition that are formed on the surface of parts above the soil -- especially on the surface of the leaves - of plants to be controlled. Such a nutritive composition appears to reduce the value of the contact angle formed on the surface of vine leaves, on the surface of soya leaves and on the surface of rape leaves, in comparison with a nutritive composition without glycerol carbonic ester. Advantageously and according to a variant, the invention relates to a fertilization method in which at least one glycerol carbonic ester is applied as a conditioner for the cultivation substrate ■■■■ for example the soil. Advantageously and according to the invention there is applied a fertilizing nutritive composition which is chosen to promote the assimilation of mineral elements by the roots and to improve the growth and the root development of the plants. It is also possible, for example, to use such a fertilizing nutritive composition on plants during the taking of cuttings therefrom or during repotting of the plants. The invention extends in particular to a fertilizing nutritive composition comprising at least one glycerol carbonic ester - especially at least one glycerol carbonic ester of formula (I), (I'), (VIII), (IX) or (X) -- and at least one microorganism chosen from the group formed of mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobacteria.

Such a nutritive treatment (by direct application and/or fertilization) of plants allows the nutritive elements necessary for their development and for their growth to be supplied to said plants, with a view to obtaining an optimum production yield given the quality of the soil, the climate, the genetic potential of said plants and the supply of water -- and optimum nutritional and organoleptic qualities. Advantageously there is applied a nutritive composition comprising at least one glycerol carbonic ester and at least one nutritive element - especially at least one mineral nutritive element useful in the development and/or the growth of the plants. Advantageously there is applied a nutritive composition according to the invention comprising at least one glycerol carbonic ester in a dosage chosen to satisfy the nutritional requirements of the plants. In particular, a nutritive composition according to the invention is applied to plants in order to compensate for a nutritional deficiency of said plants in terms of macroelements (for example nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), in terms of meso-elements (for example calcium, sulfur, magnesium) or in terms of oligoelements (for example manganese, copper, iron, boron, molybdenum, zinc, nickel, selenium, silicon or sodium). Advantageously, it is possible to apply a nutritive composition according to the invention to a plant having a deficiency of at least one nutritive element in order to compensate for that deficiency. In this case, at least one glycerol carbonic ester is advantageously applied in association with at least one nutritive agent chosen to compensate for said deficiency. It is possible to apply the nutritive composition according to the invention in any possible form, for example in the form of a powder, in the form of granules especially in the form of microgranules -, in the form of a liquid solution or in the form of a concentrated suspension of said nutritive agent, or the like. In one embodiment of the invention, there is first prepared a concentrated colloidal suspension of at least one solid in the divided state comprising at least one nutritive element of plants in a liquid phase comprising at least one glycerol carbonic ester, and then said concentrated colloidal suspension is diluted in water to form a nutritive composition for application for the treatment of plants.

Such an adjuvant is miscible with water and can be diluted in water extemporaneously prior to application to plants. The invention extends also to a plant treatment composition comprising at least one glycerol carbonic ester - especially at least one glycerol carbonic ester of formula (I), (Τ), (VIII), (IX) or (X) - and at least one active agent, other than a glycerol carbonic ester, chosen from the group formed of agents that act upon the germination of seeds, fertilizing agents and nutriments. A plant treatment composition can optionally comprise a phyto-acceptable excipient other than a glycerol carbonic ester. The invention relates also to a method for the treatment of plants, to uses of glycerol carbonic esters as an input in agriculture, to a concentrated colloidal suspension and to a plant treatment composition comprising at least one glycerol carbonic ester, characterized in combination by all or some of the features mentioned hereinabove or hereinbelow. Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon reading the following description and the implementation examples of the invention, which are given without implying any limitation and in which: - Figure 1 is a graphic representation of the change in the foliar manganese content of soya plants in cultivation after application of nutriti ve compositions comprising at least one cyclic glycerol carbonic ester according to the invention and manganese carbonate; - Figure 2 is a graphic representation of the change in the foliar manganese content of soya plants in cultivation after application of nutritive compositions comprising at least one cyclic a/a'-acylated glycerol carbonic ester according to the invention and manganese carbonate; - Figure 3 is a graphic representation of the change in the foliar manganese content of soya plants in cultivation after application of nutritive compositions comprising at least one linear glycerol carbonic ester according to the invention and manganese carbonate; - Figure 4 is a mass spectrum performed on a reaction medium obtained by carrying out a process of oligomerization of the a/a'-acetylated glycerol carbonic ester (ECG-C2) as described in Example 13. According to the present invention, at least one glycerol carbonic ester, with the exception of the dicyclic glycerol carbonate having 5 ring members, is used as an input in agriculture. It can be a cyclic glycerol carbonic ester or a linear glycerol carbonic ester. A cyclic glycerol carbonic ester can be a glycerol carbonate having a ring with 6 ring members. The cyclic glycerol carbonate (CAS 931-40-8) having 5 ring members, or 4-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-dioxolan-2-one, is described, for example, in FR 2 733 232. The cyclic a/a'-acylated glycerol carbonic esters of the general formula (VIII) can be obtained by any suitable method. In particular, for a use according to the invention, a cyclic a/a'-acylated glycerol carbonic ester of formula (VIII) can be obtained, for example, by a synthesis process in which an acylation of a cyclic glycerol carbonic ester is carried out. For example, such an acylation is carried out by adding cyclic glycerol carbonic ester, dropwise and with stirring, to a liquid medium comprising a quantity of at least one fatty acid (for example, without implying any limitation, heptanoic acid, nonanoic acid, undecylenic acid or oleic acid) and 4-methylbenzenesulfonic acid (CAS no. 6192-52-5, para-toluenesulfonic acid, ΑρΤs) brought to a temperature of approximately 11 Q°C, under a pressure of approximately 800 hPa. The reaction mixture obtained is maintained with stirring at 110°C and under 900 hPa for approximately 3 hours. In this manner there are synthesized, for example, the cyclic a/a'-heptanoylated glycerol carbonic ester (ECG-Cy), the cyclic cx/a'-nonanoylated glycerol carbonic ester (ECG-Cg), the cyclic a/a'-undecylenoylated glycerol carbonic ester (ECG-C11:]), the cyclic a/a'-oleylated glycerol carbonic ester (ECG-Cisu). It is also possible to obtain such a cyclic a/a'-acylated glycerol carbonic ester of formula (VIII) by adding an anhydride to cyclic glycerol carbonate in the presence of an ion exchange resin. For example, the cyclic ct/a'-acetylated glycerol carbonic ester, or glycerol carbonate acetate (ECG-C2) is obtained by adding acetic anhydride to glycerol in the presence of an ion exchange resin as catalyst and while maintaining the temperature of the reaction medium at 5Q°C, with mechanical stirring for approximately 4 hours. The glycerol carbonate acetate is purified by the thin film technique at a temperature of 170°C and under reduced pressure. Linear a/a'-acylated glycerol carbonic esters and linear p-acylated glycerol carbonic esters can be obtained by a particular process which is derived from the general process described hereinbelow. Linear a/a'-acylated glycerol carbonic esters -- especially oligomers of linear a/a'acylated glycerol carbonic esters ■■■■ of the general formula (X) are obtained by synthesis starting from at least one cyclic a/a'-acylated. glycerol carbonic ester of the general formula (VIII), at least one organic initiator chosen from the group formed of hydroxylated organic compounds - especially polyols, in particular glycerol -, and at least one metal catalyst chosen, for example, from the group formed of zinc sulfate (ZnS04), zinc stearate (Ζη((Τ8Η35Ο2)2), iron sulfate (FeS04), ferric phosphate (FePQ4), manganese sulfate (MnSCL), zinc oxide (ΖηΟ), calcium carbonate (Ca2C03), sodium carbonate (Na2C03) and sodium sulfate (NajSO^. In such a synthesis process, the cyclic a/a'-acylated. glycerol carbonic esters of formula (VIII), the organic initiator and the metal catalyst are mixed in a reactor which is hermetically sealed and brought to a temperature of from 150°C to 220°C and so as to place the liquid mixture under a pressure, named autogenic pressure, which is greater than or equal to atmospheric pressure. In such a synthesis process, the polymerization of the cyclic a/a'-acylated glycerol carbonic esters of the general formula (VIII) and the formation of linear a/a'-acylated glycerol carbonic esters of the general formula (X) are controlled by monitoring the autogenic pressure generated by heating of the hermetically sealed reaction medium. The mean molar masses of the linear acylated glycerol carbonic esters which are obtainable by the above process are described in Table 1 below, EXAMPLE 1 ■■■■ Synthesis of cyclic a/a'-acylated glycerol carbonic esters The synthesis of cyclic oc/a'-acylated glycerol carbonic esters, in particular of cyclic a/a'-heptanoic glycerol carbonic ester (ECG-C7), cyclic a/a'-nonanoic glycerol carbonic ester (ECG-C9), cyclic a/a'-undecylenoic glycerol carbonic ester (ECG-Cn-j) and cyclic a/a'-oleic glycerol carbonic ester (ECG-C.g.]), is carried out by esterification of the cyclic a/a'-hydroxylated glycerol carbonate with a corresponding fatty acid. 1.64 mol of fatty acid and 0.0078 mol of 4-methylbenzenesulfonic acid (CAS no. 6192-52-5, para-toluenesulfonic acid, ApTs) are placed in a 500 ml reactor equipped with a stirring device, a device for placing under reduced pressure and a "Dean-Stark" device for removing the water that forms. The temperature of the mixture is brought to a temperature of 110°C under reduced pressure of 800 hPa for a period of 15 minutes. 0.84 mol of cyclic a/a'-hydroxylated glycerol carbonate is then added dropwise to the reactor with mechanical stirring at 800 revolutions per minute (rpm) over a period of 15 minutes. The reactor is placed in an oil bath brought to a temperature of 110°C with mechanical stirring (800 rpm) for 3 hours. EXAMPLE 2 -- Purification of cyclic a/a'-acylated glycerol carbonic esters The reaction mixture is diluted in 150 ml of ethyl ether, and the mixture obtained is placed in a 1 liter separating funnel. The mixture is washed in succession with 4 volumes of water saturated with NaCl until the aqueous phase is neutral. The washed organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate and then separated from the hydrated magnesium sulfate by filtration. The ether of the organic phase is removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. A mass of dry product of 277 g is obtained. The cyclic a/a'-acylated glycerol carbonic ester is separated from the excess fatty acids by thin film distillation under reduced pressure (0.6 hPa) at a temperature that is below the boiling point of the fatty acid under that reduced pressure and below 155°C. The cyclic a/a'-acylated glycerol carbonate is obtained, the purity of which, evaluated by gas phase chromatography, is from 85% to 95%. EXAMPLE 3 -- Synthesis of the cyclic a/a'-acetylated glycerol carbonic ester (ECG~C2) 472 g of cyclic glycerol carbonate (4-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-di.oxolan-2-one, CAS 931-40-8) and 4 g of Lewatit Κ2431 resin are placed in a 2-liter three-necked glass flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a "Dean-Stark" device for removing the water that forms, containing a coolant and placed in an oil bath. 6 mol of acetic anhydride are added dropwise to the reactor in order to control and maintain the temperature of the reactor at 50°C, with mechanical stirring at 800 rpm for 4 hours. The excess acetic anhydride is removed by evaporation at a temperature of 60°C and under reduced pressure of 55 hPa. The linear a/a'-acetylated glycerol carbonicester is purified by the thin film technique carried out in an evaporator/separator at a temperature of 170°C and under reduced pressure of 0.33 hPa. The cyclic a/a'acetylated glycerol carbonic ester is obtained, the purity of which, evaluated by gas phase chromatography, is from 85% to 98%. The chemical structures of the cyclic a/a'-acylated glycerol carbonic esters synthesized in Examples 1, 2 and 3 are confirmed by mass spectrometry, by proton NMR, by i3C NMR and by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The purity of the cyclic a/a'-acylated glycerol carbonic esters and the molecular ion mass are given in Table 1 below.

The results are presented in Figure 3 (OECG-Cn:i) is identified by a star (*))• EXAMPLE 24 - Synthesis of cx/a'-oleylated glycerol oligomers (OECG-€is:i) by oligomerization of the cyclic a/a'-oleylated glycerol carbonic ester (ECG-C3g:i) 10 g of ECG~Ci8;i as obtained in Examples 1 and 2, 50 mg of zinc sulfate (ZnSCL) as catalyst and 0.7 g of glycerol as organic initiator are brought into contact in a reactor, which is hermetically sealed. The reaction mixture is then heated in the hermetically sealed reactor to reach a temperature of 200°C under autogenous pressure, and then the pressure is returned to atmospheric pressure and the temperature of 200°C is maintained for 2 hours at atmospheric pressure. The rate of conversion of ECG-Cjg:] is 97%, Analysis by gel-permeation chromatography shows the formation of oligomers of number-average molecular mass 3724 g/mol, 1787 g/mol, 1169 g/mol, 613 g/mol and 94 g/mol. EXAMPLE 25 - Use of a nutritive composition comprising glycerol oligomers (OECG-Cis:i) for the cultivation of soya A composition comprising oligomers (OECG-Cisu) as described in Example 24, glycerol, water and manganese carbonate (MnC'CL) in the form of a solid in the divided state, the solid particles of which have a mean size of approximately 2 μΐη, are mixed. The proportions by mass are approximately 0,625% OECG-Cig:i, approximately 22.915% glycerol, approximately 15.84% water and approximately 58.33% M11CO3. A concentrated colloidal suspension of M11CO3 which is stable over time and the M11CO3 particles of which do not settle is obtained. The concentrated colloidal suspension is diluted in water, and the diluted nutritive composition is applied to the soya crop by spraying at a rate of 500 grams of manganese carbonate per hectare of crop. This nutritive composition does not cause burning on the soya leaves. Such a nutritive composition permits an increase in the foliar manganese content from the first day following application, then an increase in the foliar manganese content up to four days after application, reaching a maximum value of 230 ppm, and a decline in the foliar manganese content to a value of less than 100 ppm eight days after application. The results are presented in Figure 3 (OECG-Cisn is identified by a cross (Χ)). Such a nutritive composition therefore permits delayed release of the manganese. EXAMPLE 26 ■■■■ Comparative test of an adjuvant according to the invention with the composition MANTRAC 500 on foliar MnC03 absorption A powder of manganese carbonate (MnCCL, CAS 598-62-9) having a mean particle size of substantially approximately 2 μΐη is prepared by grinding. A concentrated colloidal suspension comprising 58.7% of this powder in a liquid composition comprising 1,5% glycerol carbonate acetate (ECG-C2, as described in Example 3 and in Table 1), 39.5% glycerol, 7.5% water and 1% jojoba oil, the indicated percentages being percentages by mass. The concentrated colloidal suspension is diluted in water to form a treatment composition (Μη385) according to the invention which is suitable for applying, by spraying on the cultivated surface area, a quantity of manganese carbonate of 385 g per hectare of cultivated surface area. There are also prepared: - a concentrated colloidal suspension as described in Example 4, and this concentrated colloidal suspension is diluted in water to form a nutritive composition (Μη457) according to the invention which is suitable for applying, by spraying, a quantity of manganese carbonate of 457 g per hectare of surface area; and - a concentrated colloidal suspension as described in Example 7, and this concentrated colloidal suspension is diluted in water to form a nutritive composition (Μη509) according to the invention which is suitable for applying, by spraying, a quantity of manganese carbonate of 509 g per hectare of culti vated surface area. The nutritive compositions Μη385, Μη457 and Μη509 according to the invention are applied by spraying to plots of 4 parcels having a surface area of 16 m" cultivated with winter common wheat (variety "Quality", ARVALIS). There are also prepared in parallel: - on a plot of 4 16 m2 parcels, a crop of winter common wheat treated by spraying with water, as negative control; and - on a plot of 4 16 m2 parcels, a crop of winter common wheat treated with M11CO3 on its own (without adjuvant according to the invention) at a rate of 500 g per hectare, as control treatment; and - on a plot of 4 16 m2 parcels, a crop of winter common wheat treated, by way of comparison, with a formulation of MANTRAC 500 at a rate of 500 g of MnC03 per hectare. The results obtained in the case of the control treatment with MnC03 on its own (without adjuvant according to the invention) do not differ from the results obtained with the negative control. The manganese content retained in the leaves of treated common wheal: is measured one day (D+l), seven days (D+7), 14 days (D+14) and 21 days (D+21) after application. To that end, the leaves are removed and washed three times with water to remove the manganese carbonate that has not been absorbed by the plant, and the manganese absorbed into the leaves is then assayed. The results are given in Table 2 below and are expressed in ppm (pg of manganese per gram of leaf). Table 2 D+l D+7 D+14 D+21 MnC03 on its own 84.83 +/-28.01 74.83 +/-19.14 112.50+/-45.35 95.43 +/-5.95 MANTRAC 500 228.07 +/-139.40 171.75 +/-13.38 157.55 +/-60.81 188.00 +/-38.16 Μη385 192.00 +/-58.92 138.75 +/-20.71 164.25 +/-27.18 153.00 +/-39.61 Μη457 211.00 +/-49.79 163.25 +/-44.66 177.25 +/-41.02 177.00 +/-18.25 Μη509 329.00 +/-55.87 204.25 +/-44.62 180.75 +/-67.31 210.33 +/-29.50 It is observed that the application of Μη509 allows the foliar Μη content to be increased relative to MANTRAC 500 at D+l, D+7, D+14 and D+21. Μη509 treatment allows a foliar MnCQ3 content to be obtained that is greater than the foliar MnC03 content obtained in the case of treatment with MANTRAC 500. The use of ECG-C2 further allows a foliar MnC03 content to be obtained that is substantially equivalent to the foliar MnC03 content obtained with MANTRAC 500 but with an application of MnC03 (Μη457) at a rate of 457 g of MnC03 per hectare. The kinetics of daily MnC03 assimilation in the leaves are measured. For the composition Μη509, a daily assimilation of manganese which increases starting from the day of treatment and continues until at least 21 days after application is observed. By comparison, the daily assimilation by the common wheat treated with the composition Μη509 is twice the daily assimilation by the common wheat treated with the composition MANTRAC 500. Treatment of a cereal in cultivation with the nutritive MnC03 composition according to the invention by foliar application therefore allows the foliar manganese content of treated cereals to be increased as compared with those same cereals in cultivation treated with a composition not in accordance with the invention (MANTRAC 500) comprising the same quantity of manganese (500 g/1), in particular 1 day after the treatment, 7 days after the treatment and 21 days after the treatment. EXAMPLE 27 - Effect of the foliar application of a nutritive MnCCL composition according to the invention on the nutrition of the wheat with macroelements (Ntota!, Ctotah Ρ, Κ, Ca, Mg) and with microelements (Fe, Cu, Ζη, Β) A concentrated colloidal suspension comprising 58.7% manganese carbonate powder (having a mean particle size of substantially approximately 2 μ,ηΐ) is prepared in a liquid composition comprising 1.5% glycerol carbonate acetate (ECG-C2, as described in Example 3 and in Table 1), 39.5% glycerol, 7,5% water and 1% jojoba oil as described in Example 26. This concentrated colloidal suspension is diluted in water to form a nutritive composition according to the invention, which is applied to a wheat crop. Statistical analysis, named principal component analysis, of the kinetic measurement of the foliar manganese, macroelement and microelement contents 1 day (D+l), 7 days (D+7), 14 days (D+14) and 21 days (D+21) after application of the nutritive manganese composition makes it possible to show' the effect of the nutritive composition according to the invention on the overall nutrition of the plant. Table 3 below' gives the values of the correlation coefficients of the foliar manganese content relative to the values of the foliar contents of the various macroelements and microelements. Values close to 1 reflect a synergy in the improvement in the overall nutrition of the plant when the manganese deficiency in the wheat is removed. The negative values reflect an antagonistic effect of removing the manganese deficiency on the nutrition.

EXAMPLE 28 - Foliar application of an MnCCL suspension according to the invention on the nitrogen nutrition of wheat The change in the foliar nitrogen content in the days following treatment of parcels of wheat treated by foliar application of a negative control (CNNT) and of the treatment compositions MANTRAC500, Μη385, Μη457 and Μη509 of Example 26 is analyzed. The negative control (CNNT) shows a continuous reduction in the foliar nitrogen content. This reduction corresponds to nitrogen remobilization during leafing of the plant, in particular during the phase of grain filling. MANTRAC500 treatment brings about an increase in the nitrogen content in the leaves up to 7 days after treatment, then a reduction in foliar nitrogen owing to nitrogen mobilization into the grains. Μη385 treatment allows the foliar nitrogen content to be maintained for 13 days after treatment, followed by a reduction in foliar nitrogen. Μη457 treatment causes an increase in the nitrogen content in the leaves up to 11 days after treatment, followed by a reduction in foliar nitrogen. Μη509 treatment allows the foliar nitrogen content to he maintained for 11 days after treatment by delaying the phase of foliar nitrogen remobilization.

Each of the chosen parcels receives a treatment by fogging with one of the treatment compositions Tj, T2, T3, Τ4, T5 and T6 described in Table 5 below. Each manganese-deficient soya crop parcel is treated with 100 ml of pulp (Tl5 T2, T3, T4, Τ5 and Τ℮) comprising 4 g of manganese (MnS04 and/or MnCQ3) corresponding to a treatment dose of 500 g/ha of manganese. Table 5 Treatment composition Manganese applied (in g/ha) Treatment composition ml of stock solution in 100 ml Τΐ Water 0 T2 400 (MnC03) Example 26 10 T3 500 (MnC03) Example 4 8 T4 500 (MnC03) 80 (MnS04) Example 6 6,9 T5 600 (MnC03) Example 7 6,7 T6 500 (MnC03) Example 15 8 For each analysis of the foliar manganese content at D0, Dj, D2, D3, D6 and D9, the soya leaves removed are washed once with a 2% solution of acetic acid in demineralized water and then twice with demineralized water. The leaves are then dried for 48 hours at a temperature of 75°C. Three analyses are carried out in parallel. The nutritive compositions T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6 permit rapid magnanese assimilation from application of the treatment and for one to two days following application of the treatment. Application of composition T2 (ECG-C2 and jojoba oil, MnCOs at 400 g/ha) shows sustained and increasing manganese assimilation, which increases from 130 ppm to 160 ppm between the second and the ninth day following the treatment. Compositions T3, T4 and T5 (ECG-C2) show a strong and temporary initial (first and second days) assimilation, followed by renewed assimilation around the seventh and eighth day following the treatment. Composition T6 (OECG~C2) shows moderate and temporary intitial (first day) assimilation, but a renewal of assimilation which is at a maximum at four days and is sustained until the ninth day after the treatment. The choice of the glycerol carbonic esters and the quantity of solid in the divided state applied to the plants allow the assimilation profile of the solid in the divided state in the plants to be modulated. EXAMPLE 30 - Treatment of barley seeds The seeds of a plant chosen, for example, from the group formed of maize, barley, rape and a forage plant such as Ray grass are treated. To that end, barley seeds (variety Orjoie, RAGT) having a weight of 17.1 g per 300 grains are chosen. The seeds are coated/film-coated with a composition comprising oligomers (OECG-C2) as described in Example 14 at a rate of a maximum quantity of 1 liter of oligomer composition per tonne of seeds. The seeds and the oligomer composition are mixed, and the mixture is left to dry. The germinating power of the barley seeds treated with the composition comprising oligomers (OECG-C2) at a rale of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 liter/tonne of seeds is analyzed, and the value of the germinating power obtained under each of those conditions is compared with the value of the germinating power of "control" seeds treated with the same quantity of water. The germinating power, expressed as the percentage of grains that have germinated after five days, obtained with treatments of 0.1 liter/tonne, 0.25 liter/tonne, 0.5 liter/tonne (90.1%) and 1 liter/tonne is greater by 3.6% to 7,3% than the value of the germinating power of the "control" (82.8%). EXAMPLE 31 - Treatment of maize seeds. Maize seeds (PR33V15, Pioneer) having a weight of 60.7 g per 200 grains are chosen. The seeds are coated/film-coated with a composition comprising oligomers (OECG-C2) as described in Example 14 at a rate of a maximum quantity of 1 liter of oligomer composition per tonne of seeds. The seeds and the oligomer composition are mixed, and the mixture is left to dry. The germinating power of the maize seeds treated with the composition comprising oligomers (OECG-C2) at a rate of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 liter/tonne of seeds is analyzed, and the value of the germinating power obtained under each of those conditions is compared with the value of the germinating power of "control" seeds treated with the same quantity of water. The germinating power, expressed as the percentage of grains that have germinated after five days, obtained with treatments of 0.1 liter/tonne, 0.25 liter/tonne and 0.5 liter/tonne (90.1%)) is greater by 1.3% to 1.6% than the value of the germinating power of the "control". EXAMPLE 32 -- Analysis of the vegetative development of the parts of plants above the soil and of the root parts of plants grown from seeds Maize and barley seeds previously treated by coating/film-coating with a composition comprising oligomers (OECG-C2) as described in Examples 30 and 31 are cultivated on sand. After 15 days' growth, the parts above the soil (leaves) and the root parts of the plantlets are separated and weighed. Treatments with 0.1 liter/tonne and 0,25 liter/tonne lead to an increase of 29% and 11%, respectively, in the total mass (parts above the soil and root parts) of the plantlets and of 40% and 23%' of the mass of the root parts relative to the "control" plantlets. EXAMPLE 33 -- Synergistic effect of a composition according to the invention comprising oligomers (OECG-C2) and a mineral nutritional supplement Maize seeds are coated/film-coated as described in Example 31 with a composition comprising manganese (SeedFlow Μη) at a rate of 3 liters/tonne of seeds and the composition comprising oligomers (OECG-C2) at a rate of 0,25 liter/tonne of seeds. An increase in the germinating power of the seeds treated with manganese and the composition of oligomers (OECG-C2) of 3% relative to the germinating power of seeds treated with the manganese composition or with the composition of oligomers is observed. EXAMPLE 34 - Synergistic effect of a composition according to the invention comprising oligomers (OECG-C2) and a endomycorrhizal fungus Barley seeds are coated/film-coated as described in Example 30 with the composition comprising oligomers (OECG-C2) and an endomycorrhizal fungus. An increase in the germinating power of the seeds treated with the endomycorrhizal fungus relative to "control” seeds and an increase of approximately 2% in the germinating power of the seeds treated with the endomycorrhizal fungus and with the composition comprising oligomers (OECG-C2) relative to the germinating power of the seeds treated with an endomycorrhizal fungus alone is observed. EXAMPLE 35 - Stimulation of photosynthesis A nutritive composition (Mn/OECG-Cn:i) comprising oligomers (OECG-Cn:i) and manganese carbonate as described in Examples 22 and 23 is applied to soya plants by spraying, at a rate of 500 grams of manganese carbonate per hectare of crop. Immediately after application of the nutritive composition, the chlorophyll fluorescence is measured on leaves of soya plants that have received the nutritive composition and, by way of control, on leaves of soya plants that have not received the nutritive composition. An increased photosynthetic efficiency value (0.836) is observed for the treatment with the nutritive composition (Mn/OECG-Cil:i), as compared with the photosynthetic efficiency value (0.831) of the control not treated with the oligomer. EXAMPLE 36 -- Stimulation of photosynthesis A nutritive composition (Mn/OECG-Ci8:i) comprising oligomers (OECG-Ci8:i) and manganese carbonate as described in Examples 24 and 25 is applied to soya plants by spraying, at a rate of 500 grams of manganese carbonate per hectare of crop. Immediately after application of the nutritive composition, the chlorophyll fluorescence is measured on leaves of soya plants that have received the nutritive composition and, by way of control, on leaves of soya plants that have not received the nutritive composition. An increased photosynthetic efficiency value (0.848) is observed for the treatment with the nutritive composition (Mn/OECG-Ci8:i), as compared with the photosynthetic efficiency value (0.831) of the control not treated with the oligomer.
