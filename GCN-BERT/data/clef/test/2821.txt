1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-(N-{(R)-α-[N-{(S)-1-[N-((S)-1-carboxyethyl)carbamoyl]ethyl}carbamoyl]benzyl}carbamoylmethoxy)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-(N-{(R)-α-[N-((S)-1-{N-[(S)-1-(t-butoxycarbonyl)ethyl]carbamoyl} ethyl)carbamoyl]benzyl} carbamoylmethoxy)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine (Method 26; 34 mg, 0.041 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of DCM:TFA (3:1,4 ml). The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 hours. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The product was purified by preparative HPLC using a MeCN/0.1 M ammonium acetate buffer gradient (5/95 to 100/0) as eluent to give the title compound 23 mg (72%). NMR (500 MHz, CD3OD) 0.81 (bt, 6H), 0.88-1.54 (m, 16H), 1.56-1.71 (m, 2H), 2.11 (s, 3H), 3.8-4.2 (m, 2H), 4.33-4.42 (m, 2H), 4.66 (ABq, 2H), 5.55 (s, 1H), 6.61 (s, 1H), 7.07 (t, 1H), 7.22 (brd, 2H), 7.28-7.43 (m, 6H), 7.48 (d, 2H); m/z 782.1.
