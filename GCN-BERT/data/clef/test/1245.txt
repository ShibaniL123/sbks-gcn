CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to, and is a continuation-in-part of, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/577,377 filed 19 Dec. 2014, entitled “Method and Portable Apparatus for Exercising the Upper Extremities,” and the entire specification thereof is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The invention relates generally to methods of exercise and exercising apparatuses, particularly apparatuses and methods for exercising a person's upper body, and specifically to a therapeutic apparatus and method for exercising the arms and upper body which can be selectively adjusted to offer the user adjustable resistance exercise. 2. Background Art It is known to provide devices for exercising a person's upper body. Examples of known devices in this field of endeavor include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,588,102; U.S. Pat. No. 6,306,064; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2003/0092536; U.S. Pat. No. 6,217,494; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,531,729. The known devices, however, generally suffer from drawbacks due to complexity, lack of versatility, and lack of portability. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE There is disclosed an upper-body exercise apparatus and methods for using the apparatus. The apparatus is simple to make and use, and is advantageously portable and versatile. The apparatus may be fabricated, for example, from rigid metal, plastic, or composite tubing. The apparatus has two principal components that are mutually engagable in either of two configurations, depending upon the type of exercise sought to be performed. A base portion is temporarily and releasably connectable to an extension portion. The base portion and the extension portion may be connected in a very general zig-zag configuration to be manipulated manually in a manner somewhat similar to the pedaling of a bicycle. The base portion and the extension portion can then be disconnected and then reconnected in a generally U-shaped configuration to be manipulated manually in a manner somewhat suggestive of two-handed rowing or cranking motion. The apparatus configuration thus can be selectively switched back and forth between the pedal configuration and the crank configuration. The apparatus includes two or three grips rotatably mounted upon selected portions of the base and extension portions. The invention includes an adjustable grip resistance subassembly, whereby a hand grip's resistance to rotation relative to its respective supporting member can be regulated and adjusted by a user. Further, there is disclosed a subassembly for gauging a hand grip's resistance to rotation. Gauging a hand grip's resistance to rotation permits a user to see and monitor the magnitude of the grip's rotary resistance, and to repeatedly re-set the apparatus to a selected desired resistance to rotation. The invention includes a methods of using the apparatus by grasping it in a variety of manners and revolving it about itself in one or more positions and orientation in space relative to the user's body. The method includes revolving the apparatus around itself while maintaining it in a single orientation, as well as revolving it around itself while also moving its position relative to the user. The method includes use of the apparatus by two users.

DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT There is disclosed hereby a method and apparatus for exercising the upper portions of the human body. Succinctly described, the apparatus of the invention includes a “zigzag” configured rod that has rotatable grips on three parallel sections of thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the apparatus can alternatively be configured or re-configured in a U-shape. The user, with or without the assistance of another person (who would grasp the central grip), grasps two “end” grips and rotates the device around its central section to perform a wide variety of exercises. The exercises are beneficial for the arms and upper body. The apparatus according to the invention is portable, and is contemplated for use in lieu of conventional known upper extremity “bike” type devices. The apparatus is light weight and easily transported. The apparatus offers beneficial versatility of use to permit a wide variety of range of motion (ROM) exercises for strengthening and endurance, promoting variety of methods of use. Previous known devices in the general field of endeavor involve bicycle-pedal-like cranks that are rotatably mounted in a cumbersome frame, which is then secured (often temporarily) to a table top or other supporting surface. An advantage of the present system is its portability and versatility compared to frame-mounted devices. With most upper extremity bikes the patient-use holds onto the pedals and then rotates the pedals either forward or reverse to move his or her arms in fixed-location circles. The presently disclosed apparatus is an improved alternative because, among other benefits, it better works a patient's strength and endurance; users of known upper extremity bikes can simply hold on and “go through the motions.” Also, it need not be mounted upon a table or other surface. Attention is invited to FIG. 1, showing the upper extremity exerciser apparatus 10. The principal components of the apparatus may be fabricated from any suitable lightweight, durable, material, such as fabricated tubes or rods of plastic, polymer composite, aluminum alloy, or the like. As seen in FIG. 1, the apparatus 10 preferably includes a base portion 12 and an extension portion 14. Each portion 12, 14, may be fabricated from lightweight tubes (or alternatively, solid rods) in the general configurations shown; the tubes may have, for example, a diameter of from about 1.2 cm to about 3.0 cm, preferably about 1.3 cm (0.5 inch). When assembled for use, the apparatus 10 has an overall length (i.e., from side-to-side as seen in FIGS. 3 and 4) of from about 38 cm (15 inches) to about 56 cm (22 inches), although this is by way of preferred example rather than by way of limitation. In its simplest version, the apparatus 10 is configured solely in the zig-zag pedal configuration seen in FIG. 3. In such an embodiment, the base portion 12 and the extension portion 14 are integrated into one unit, i.e., they are fabricated separately but are then permanently secured together or, alternatively, are fabricated unitarily such as from a single bent/molded/formed rod or tube. Optionally but preferably, the base portion 12 and the extension portion 14 are releasably connected together to permit their arrangement or re-arrangement into the U-shaped crank configuration depicted in FIG. 4. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the base portion 12 has an outer base portion 18 and an inner base portion 20 joined by an angled intermediate base portion 22. The three base portions 18, 20, 22 preferably are integrated, as fabricated from a molded or bent rod or tube, but alternatively could be assembled (e.g., by welding adhesives, or the like) from component parts. The extension portion 14 similarly has a relatively abbreviated inner extension portion 24 joined to an outer extension portion 26 by an angled intermediate extension portion 28. The extension portion 14 also preferably is integral, such as a single segment of rigid pipe or tube bent or molded into the shape indicated. There is a generally cylindrically tubular left hand grip 30 rotatably mounted upon the outer base portion 18, and a cylindrically tubular middle hand grip 31 rotatably mounted upon the base inner portion 20. A similar right hand grip 32 is mounted for rotation upon the outer extension portion 26. Any means known in the art for providing coaxial rotation, while preferably limiting axial shifting, may be used. Separate ball bearing or bushing assemblies may be provided (e.g., or one or more bearings 68, 69, as disclosed hereinafter having reference to FIGS. 15 and 16), or there may simply be provided between each grip 30, 31, 32 and its respective base or extension portion (18, 20, 26) a long-lasting lubrication and/or a slippery sleeve element (e.g. a TEFLON® sleeve or the like). Regardless of the selected means for providing the connection between each hand grip 30, 31, 32 and its respective base or extension portion, each hand grip surrounds circumferentially its respective supporting member (base or extension portion), and is free to rotate coaxially around it with minimal axial/longitudinal shifting of the grip relative to its supporting portion. The grips 30, 31, 32 are adapted to be grasped by a user's hand, and thus preferably have an axial length slightly greater than the lateral width of a grasping human hand (e.g. about 11 cm (about 4.5 inches)). The axial length of each base and extension portion 18, 20, 26 that mounts a grip 30, 31, 32 accordingly is at least as long as its corresponding hand grip. The grips 30, 31, 32 are provided with exterior gripping surfaces composed of any suitable composition known in the art for providing a comfortable and reliable (non-slip) contact with a user's grasping hand. Grips 30, 31, 32 may each have an outside diameter of, say, between about 2.0 cm (about 0.75 inch) and about 4.0 cm (about 1.5 inches). Tubular grips typically have inside diameters just larger than the outside diameter of the corresponding base or extension portion, but to allow the provision of rotary connection means radially between the grip and base/extension portion as needed. Attention is invited to FIGS. 2-4, especially FIG. 2. The base portion 12 is configured such that the intersecting axes of the base intermediate portion 22 and base inner portion 20 define an included angle α (alpha). Likewise, although not expressly labeled in FIG. 2, the extension portion 14 is shaped so that the intersecting axes of the extension intermediate portion 28 and extension outer portion 26 also define an angle. Very preferably, but not necessarily, the intersecting axes of the extension intermediate portion 28 and the extension outer portion 26 define an angle equal to angle α, that is, substantially equal to the angle defined between the base intermediate portion 22 and base inner portion 20. The base portion 12 is so shaped that the axis of the base outer portion 18 is substantially parallel to the axis of the base inner portion 20 (although these portions are axially offset from one another by the conjoined base intermediate portion 22). Similarly, the extension portion 14 is so shaped that the axis of the extension outer portion 26 is substantially parallel to the axis of the short stub (if any) of the optional but preferable extension inner portion 24. Accordingly, an angle β defined between the base outer portion 18 and the base intermediate portion 22 can be characterized as supplementary to the angle α (i.e., (β=180°−α), and the angle defined between the extension inner portion 24 and the extension intermediate portion 28 likewise can also be characterized as supplementary to angle α. In a preferred embodiment of the apparatus, angle α preferably is between 75° and 85°, and most preferably is about 80°. Notwithstanding the foregoing, simple embodiments of the apparatus may feature an angle α of approximately 90°. Thus, the portions of the apparatus 10 optionally may define only right angles between the intermediate portions 22, 28 and their respective outer and inner portions 18, 20 and 24, 26. FIGS. 1 and 2 are exploded views of apparatus 10 to show that the base portion 12 is releasably engagable with the extension portion 14. While temporarily engaged and interconnected for use, the base portion 12 and the extension portion 14 are immobile in relation to each other, and function as a single unit. The extension inner portion 24, if present, is temporarily connectable, for example by a telescopic insertion, with the base inner portion 20. In an alternative embodiment, there is no extension inner portion embodied, the extension portion 14 comprising merely an outer extension portion 26 and an intermediate extension portion 28; in such an embodiment, the base inner portion 20 is releasably connectable directly to the intermediate extension portion 28. The connection between the base portion 12 and extension portion 14 is by any suitable temporary, releasable connection mode known in the art for attaching/detaching the free ends of tubes or rods axially or angularly. For example, there may be provided a threaded screw engagement between the base portion 12 and the extension portion 14. For instance, a screw may penetrate the extension portion 14, e.g., the inner extension portion 24 is absent and a screw or bolt means penetrates approximately diametrically the inner end of the intermediate extension portion 28 laterally, for releasable/loosable screwed engagement axially into the inner end of the inner base inner portion 20. Other suitable screwed connections will suffice. Another example means for releasably connecting the base portion to the extension portion may be by a well-known spring-loaded detent or catch assembly; one or two spring-biased connection buttons 40 may be disposed on the extension inner portion 24 for engagement into a pair of connection holes 41 defined at appropriate places in the free end of the base inner portion 20. Only one connection hole 41 is seen in the drawing figures; a second hole preferably is defined in the base inner portion diametrically opposite from the hole seen in the drawing, to permit the extension portion 14 to be connected with the base portion 12 in either of two relative positions, as to be explained further herein. The extension inner portion 24 is insertable into the open end of the base inner portion 20, which induces the refraction of the connection button(s) against the bias of their spring(s); when the button(s) 40 are in registration with the connection holes 41, the buttons are urged into the connection holes by the action of spring bias to provide a releasable junction of the extension portion 14 with the base portion 12. Manual depression of the buttons against the spring bias allows the extension portion to be disconnected from the base portion 12. The aspect of the invention is the preferable ability, by whatever means, including those described above or equivalents known in the art, for a user to detach or loosen the extension portion 14 relative to the base portion 12 so to permit a user selectively to arrange and rearrange the apparatus in either a pedal configuration or a crank configuration, as shall now be described. Combined reference to FIGS. 1-4 shows that the apparatus 10 can be selectively arranged in either of two working configurations. By detaching and reattaching the extension portion 14 from and to the base inner portion 20, the relative positions of the base portion 12 and extension portion 14 can be adjusted. FIG. 3 depicts the apparatus 10 in the zig-zag “pedal configuration,” while FIG. 4 shows the apparatus configured in the U-shaped “crank configuration.” In the pedal configuration of FIG. 3, the respective axes of the base outer portion 18, the base inner portion 20, and the extension outer portion 26 are mutually parallel, but no two of these have their axes aligned; only the base inner portion 20 and the extension inner portion 24 (if employed) are in coaxial registration with their axes aligned. In contrast, when the apparatus 10 is in the crank configuration seen in FIG. 4, the axis of the base inner portion 20 is parallel to the extension outer portion 26, and the axis of the base outer portion 18 is aligned with the axis of the extension outer portion 26, while the base inner portion 20 and the extension inner portion 24 also are coaxially connected. Referring to FIGS. 2-4, it is seen that the apparatus 10 thus can be switched back and forth between the pedal configuration and the crank configuration. If the apparatus 10 initially is in the pedal configuration of FIG. 3, the extension portion 14 simply can be disconnected from the base portion 12, rotated 180 degrees, and re-connected to the base portion to arrange the apparatus in the crank position of FIG. 4. In a preferred embodiment, therefore, the means for releasably connecting the free end of the extension inner portion 24 to the free end of the base inner portion 20 permits the extension portion 14 to be connected to the base portion 12 in either of the respective two use configurations of FIGS. 3 and 4, and then be disconnected and then reconnected in the other use position. A significant advantage of the apparatus is its versatility of use. The apparatus 10 is used in either the pedal configuration or the crank configuration. If desired, a patient-user can readily switch back and forth between these configurations during the course of a single exercise or therapy session. Furthermore, the apparatus is adapted for use either by a single user alone, or by a patient in cooperative use with a physical therapist or assistant. Because the apparatus 10 need not and is not encumbered by any frame or support components, it can be placed in nearly any position, relative to the user(s) bodies, for use. And the apparatus 10 can be situated in practically any orientation in three-dimensional space for use. The methodological versatility provided is thus nearly limitless. Attention is invited to FIGS. 5-7, showing a user utilizing the upper extremity exerciser apparatus 10 to execute a variety of upper extremity exercises. FIGS. 5-7 illustrate the apparatus 10 assembled and used in the “pedal configuration.” The user is depicted in a standing position, but it is noted that he alternatively could be seated, kneeling, crouching, or even lying on his back, etc. The user holds the apparatus 10 by grasping the grips 30 and 32. With his arms in front and palms facing generally down, the user pedals the apparatus by revolving the respectively offset axes of the base outer portion 18 and of the extension outer portion 26 around the central co-axis of the inner portions 20, 24. The revolutions can be in either direction (forward and backward, i.e., clockwise or counterclockwise about the axes of the inner portions 20, 24), and the direction of revolution can be in one direction only, or can be repeatedly reversed. Additionally, it is to be understood that while the drawing figures show the user practicing methods while his palms/wrists are facing downward, the user's grasp upon either or both grips 30 and/or 32 can be with the palm(s)/wrist(s) facing upward; with the knuckles of either or both hand thus directed upward, the character of the user's grasp is altered subtly, modestly but significantly altering the character of her muscular activity and broadening the workout. The type of grasp (upper- or lower-facing) can be changed or alternated during a workout session, and for either or both hands. Such a method of use works on the range of motion for the user's joints in the wrists, elbows, shoulders, and shoulder girdle, and strengthens associated muscle groups. During this “horizontal mid-center” method of use illustrated in FIG. 5, the co-axis of the inner portions 20, 24 is held generally horizontal (e.g., parallel to the floor), and may be maintained in a single position in space for a selected interval of time. In FIG. 5, the apparatus 10 is held at about the height of the user's bust/chest. Significantly, the user can also perform similar “pedaling” exercises closely related to that described immediately above, but with the apparatus 10 moved to a different location in space. For example, with the co-axis of the inner portions 20, 24 maintained generally horizontal, the user may practice the “horizontal upper-center” method of use shown in FIG. 6. The user of this method also pedals (in either rotary direction) the apparatus by revolving the axes of the base outer portion 18 and the extension outer portion 26 around the co-axis of the inner portions 20, 24; in this version of the method of use, the co-axis of the inner portions 20, 24 is held at, for example, about the height of the user's face, although it could be held even higher. For example, the versatility of the invention permits the user to tip his head forward, and to situate the apparatus above and slightly behind his head to “pedal” it at that location, to work yet a different collection of joints and muscles. This practice improves the range of motion for the user's joints in the wrists, elbows, shoulders, and shoulder girdle, and strengthens associated muscle groups. However, owing to the fact that the apparatus 10 is held at a height relatively greater than that seen in FIG. 5, the joints, muscles, and muscle groups/pairs are subjected, collectively as well as individually, to a “horizontal upper-center” workout different in type and degree to the workout received by using the apparatus 10 in the horizontal mid-center method of FIG. 5. In a similar mode, the co-axis of the inner portions 20, 24 can be held horizontal and lowered to practice a “horizontal lower-center” method of use shown in FIG. 7. The user of this method also pedals (in either rotary direction (clockwise and/or counterclockwise)) the apparatus by revolving the axes of the base outer portion 18 and extension outer portion 26 around the central co-axis of the inner portions 20, 24. The co-axis of the inner portions 20, 24 is held at, for example, about the height of the user's waist, although it could be held even lower. Again, this practice improves the range of motion for the user's joints in the wrists, elbows, shoulders, and shoulder girdle, and strengthens associated muscle groups. However, owing to the fact that the apparatus 10 is held at a height relatively greater than that seen in FIG. 5, the joints, muscles, and muscle groups/pairs are subjected, collectively as well as individually, to a “horizontal lower-center” workout different in type as well as degree to the workout received by using the apparatus 10 in either of the methodologies of FIG. 5 or 6. The method of the invention includes moving the apparatus 10 amongst and between the various spatial positions seen in FIGS. 5-7. Thus the user, while continuously pedaling the apparatus and substantially maintaining the horizontality of the co-axis of the inner portions 20, 24, may move the apparatus 10 in front of her torso in an up-and-down manner. While the revolving of the outer portions 18, 26 is continued, the user can translate the apparatus alternately between the horizontal upper-center position (FIG. 6) and the horizontal lower-center position (FIG. 7), or between any number of intermediate height positions. The method according to the invention includes operating the apparatus 10, in the pedal configuration, while the co-axis of the inner portions 20, 24 is oriented substantially vertically. Referring to FIG. 8, the user is depicted in a standing position; it is again noted that he alternatively could be seated, kneeling, crouching, etc. FIG. 8 shows a “vertical mid-left” method of use, with the central co-axis maintained toward the left side of the user's torso. The user holds the apparatus 10 by grasping the grips 30 and 32. With his arms in front of his torso and with his lower arms (i.e., radius and ulna bones) approximately parallel to the floor/ground, the user pedals the apparatus—again by revolving the respectively offset axes of the base outer portion 18 and of the extension outer portion 26 around the central co-axis defined by the inner portions 20, 24. As seen in FIG. 8, the co-axis of the connected inner portions 20, 24 is oriented substantially vertically (i.e., if the user is standing or seated), while the vertically oriented, but laterally offset, axes of the outer portions 18, 26 revolve around the central co-axis. And again, the revolutions can be in either direction (forward and backward, i.e., clockwise or counterclockwise about the axes of the inner portions 20, 24). The direction of revolution can be in one direction only, or can be repeatedly reversed. Such a method of use works on the range of motion for the user's joints in the wrists, elbows, shoulders, and shoulder girdle, and strengthens associated muscle groups. During the “vertical mid-left” method of use illustrated in FIG. 8, the co-axis of the inner portions 20, 24 is held generally vertical (e.g., perpendicular to the floor) and may be maintained in a single position in space for a selected or predetermined and measured interval of time. In FIG. 8, the apparatus 10 is held at about the height of the user's chest, toward the left side of the user's torso. Significantly, the user can also perform similar “pedaling” exercises closely related to that described immediately above, but with the apparatus 10 moved to a different location in space. For example, with the co-axis of the inner portions 20, 24 maintained generally vertical, the user may practice the “vertical mid-right” method of use shown in FIG. 9, with the co-axis of the inner portions held toward the right side of the user's torso. The methodology is generally the same as that of the vertical mid-left method of FIG. 8, except that the apparatus 10 is held toward the right side of the user's torso. FIG. 10 shows the user practicing a similar “vertical mid-center” method of use. The methodology is generally the same as that of the vertical mid-left method of FIG. 8 and the vertical mid-right method of FIG. 9, except that the apparatus 10 is held at about the center of the user's torso. It is understood that the user can practice the methods of FIGS. 8-10 with either hand, right or left, being the “upper” hand and the other the “lower” hand. (The user's right hand is the upper hand in FIGS. 8-10, but the method includes the inverse, whereby the user's left hand is upper.) One hand is above the other, and the method includes having the left hand grip the upper end of the apparatus 10. Moreover, it is to be understood that the user can reverse hand positions (left for right) during an exercise session, alternating left hand and right hand as the upper hand. It again is to be recognized that the user may practice these vertically oriented methods with his palms/wrists facing either forward (away from the user's torso) or backward (toward the user's torso). The user's grasp upon either or both grips 30 and/or 32 can be with the palm(s)/wrist(s) facing outward or inward. In FIG. 8, for example, the right hand is in a palm-out position, while the left hand is in a palm-in position. In FIGS. 9 and 10, both hands are in the palm-in position. During the practice of the methods, either hand can be in either type of position to grasp the respective grips 30, 32 of the apparatus. The position of the user's hands upon the grips of the apparatus affects the character of the user's grasp and the motions of her arms, altering the character of her muscular activity and broadening the workout. The type of grasp (out-facing or in-facing) can be changed or alternated during a workout session, and for either or both hands. The method of the invention includes moving the apparatus 10 amongst and between the various spatial positions seen in FIGS. 8-10. The user, while continuously pedaling the apparatus and substantially maintaining the verticality of the co-axis of the inner portions 20, 24, may move the apparatus 10 in front of her torso in a side-to-side manner. While the revolving of the outer portions 18, 26 is continued, the user can translate the apparatus alternately between the vertical mid-left position (FIG. 8) and the vertical mid-right position (FIG. 10), or between any number of intermediate lateral side-to-side positions. The vertically oriented usages of the apparatus seen in FIGS. 8-10 works on the both internal and external rotation of both the user's shoulders, each in two different planes. The method of the invention also includes using the apparatus 10 while it is assembled in the U-shaped “crank configuration” seen in FIG. 4. The apparatus 10 in the crank configuration generally is used in a front-and-center spatial position as suggested by FIG. 11. The user can utilize the apparatus 10 in the crank configuration in either a solo mode or with the assistance of a therapist or assistant. The user may be sitting or standing. Whether the user is alone or accompanied by a second person such as a therapist, the method involves the user executing a cranking or rowing type of motion. In this rowing motion, the coaxially aligned outer portions 18, 26 of the apparatus 10 revolve around the central co-axis defined by the conjoined inner portions 20, 24. This arrangement is seen in FIG. 11. When the user is accompanied and assisted by a second person, the rowing action involves steadily holding the conjoined inner portions 20, 24 at a substantially fixed position in 3-D space while the user moves the outer portions 18, 26 about the immobile axis of revolution defined by the inner portions. Attention is invited to FIG. 12 in this regard. In the method, the second person (e.g., therapist) firmly grasps the middle hand grip 31 on the base inner portion 20 of the apparatus, and holds the apparatus as steadily as possible so as to maintain the axis of rotation 45 at a generally fixed position in space. (The axis of rotation 45 ordinarily is oriented horizontally as seen in the figure, but alternatively may be oriented vertically.) The user grasps the grips 30, 32 in his left and right hands, and cranks or “rows” the apparatus 10 by moving the co-axis of the outer portions 18 and 26 around the axis of revolution 45 as indicated by the directional arrow in FIG. 12. Of course, the direction of revolution can be either forward or backward, and the user can alternately reverse the direction of revolution during a therapeutic session. The therapist occasionally during a therapy session can relocate in 3-D space (or in relation to the user) the position or orientation of the apparatus's axis of revolution 45. This method well-works the user's shoulder joint and shoulder girdle. FIG. 13 shows a mode for practicing the invention by a solo user manipulating the apparatus 10 in the pedal configuration. In this version of the method, one or more interchangeable ballast weights 50 of selected weight are attached to or suspended from the middle hand grip 31 of the base inner portion 20. The suspension can be by any appropriate means, such as by placing a conventional cuff weight around and on the middle hand grip 31, or alternatively by disposing a fabric sling assembly around the base inner portion 20 so to hang down with one or ballast weights 50 in or on the sling. A preferred version of the solo-operator mode of FIG. 13 features an axis of revolution 46 defined by the axes of the conjoined inner portions 20, 24 of the apparatus 10 in the pedal configuration. To practice the solo method of FIG. 13, the user holds her arms out in front of her (preferably but not strictly necessarily straight out (i.e. horizontally)), and pivots her arms up and down to revolve the outer portions 18, 26 of the apparatus so to cause the inner portions 20, 24 (with the ballast weight 50 thereupon) to rotate around the axis 46, as suggested by the directional arrow of FIG. 13. The weight 50 helps mildly to stabilize the apparatus in motion. Moreover and importantly, the weight force is against gravity, thus amplifying the exercise of the user's upper extremities as she holds the apparatus in position in front of her body (preferably with arms substantially parallel to the floor). The user must exercise many muscles of the arms and shoulder to maintain the position and motion of the apparatus 10 about the axis 46; the exercise is particularly effective if the user holds her arms in a straight horizontal position. It is noted that the apparatus 10 can be used to practice a method in which the apparatus is configured in the pedal configuration (FIG. 3), but practiced by two persons, such as a patient and therapist. In this version of the method, there is no placement of a weight 50 on the mid hand grip 31; rather, the middle hand grip 31 of the apparatus (in the pedal position) is grasped by the therapist (in the manner indicated by FIG. 12). The user-patient can thus “pedal” the apparatus in the manner suggested by FIG. 13, but with the second person's grasp lending stability to the position and operation. The angled relations between the intermediate portions 22 and 28 of the apparatus 10 and the respective inner portions 20, 24 and outer portions 18, 26 facilitate the practice of the methods of the invention illustrated by FIGS. 11-13. When the apparatus 10 is in either the U-shaped crank configuration or the zigzag pedal configuration, the configuration having the angle α promotes the practice of the invention by two persons. The angle α, as described and explained hereinabove, removes laterally the right and left outer hand grips 30 and 32 a modest distance away from the mid hand grip 31. This provides a clearance for the presence of the therapist's lower arm and hand—a clearance not provided when there is a right angle of ninety degrees defined by the intersections of the inner and outer portions of the base portion 12 and extension portion 14 with their respective intermediate portions 22 and 28. This is an advantage over many known “bike” type exercisers. Attention is advanced to FIG. 14, depicting a specialized method of use in which the apparatus remains in the pedal configuration. The apparatus 10 is held in the user's hands at a tilted or angled position, with the co-axis of the inner portions 20, 24 skewed relative to both the vertical and the horizontal. The user, while grasping the two outer grips 30, 32, counter-pivots his wrists relative to each other in a pivoting wobbling-like manner to cause the conjoined inner portions 20, 24 of the apparatus to simultaneously pitch and yaw. The user's knuckles bob to and fro, as suggested by the directional arrows in FIG. 14. The activity results in the opposite ends of the base inner portion 20 to revolve in two generally circular paths, as also indicated by directional arrows in FIG. 14. The user can execute this sort of eccentric rotary motion in ether a backward (clockwise) or forward (counterclockwise) direction, but the exercise can be executed by most individuals only while the hands/fists are in a palms-down position as seen in the figure. Propelling the apparatus 10 in this manner, primarily with wrist action, especially while periodically reversing and re-reversing the direction of rotation, improves wrist flexion and extension, as well as radial and ulnar flexion and extension. Further, propelling the apparatus in this mode also works on pronation and supination of the forearms at the radioulnar joint. Lower arm muscle groups are unconventionally exercised. In various and certain exercises and therapies, it may be desirable to adjust the resistance to rotation presented by the apparatus 10 to the user(s). An alternative embodiment of the present apparatus 10 thus optionally but preferably may feature adjustability of the resistance to rotation of a hand grip (e.g., 30 and/or 32) around an associated base portion 18 or extension portion 26. Thus a left hand grip 30 is rotatably disposed on the outer base portion 18, there being a resistance to rotation of the left hand grip relative to the outer base portion; similarly, there preferably is a resistance to rotation of the right hand grip 32 relative to the outer extension portion 26. In the following description of an adjustable grip resistance embodiment of the apparatus 10, a version having a right hand grip 32 with an adjustable resistance to rotation around an outer extension portion 26 of the apparatus is described. But it is to be understood, with example reference to FIG. 1, that alternative embodiments of the apparatus may also have a left hand grip 30 with adjustable resistance to rotation around its corresponding outer base portion 18. It is contemplated that most alternative embodiments of the apparatus 10 having adjustable grip resistance will have a left hand grip 30 with adjustable rotation resistance around the outer base portion 18, and a right hand grip 32 with adjustable rotation resistance around its associated outer extension portion 26. Ordinarily, the middle hand grip 31 remains freely (non-adjustably) rotatable around the base inner portion 20; nevertheless it is within the scope of the invention to provide one, two, or all three grips 30, 31, 32 with adjustable resistance to rotation about their respective supporting base or extension members 18, 20, and/or 26. Thus, there is disclosed means whereby the force or torque required to rotate a particular grip, for example left hand grip 32 upon its supporting member, e.g. extension portion 26, can be selectively adjusted and temporarily set prior to use of the apparatus, thereby to customize the grip's resistance to rotation. The resistance may be customized to a particular user/patient, or to a particular type of exercise, a selected limb (arm, leg), or the like, all according to the user's or therapist's choice or judgment. In the embodiment disclosed hereafter, the adjustment is not strictly step-wise or incremental; rather, the resistance to rotation is infinitely adjustable between two outer limits, allowing the resistance to be fine-tuned to the user's choice. FIGS. 15 and 16 provide views of an adjustable grip resistance assembly for an embodiment of the apparatus 10 having an adjustable grip resistance assembly. The elements of the assembly include, and are disposed upon, a supporting member 60 which, depending upon the selected variation on the apparatus 10, is one of the supporting base or extension members 18 or 20 or 26. As used herein, including the claims, the term “supporting member” refers to the outer base portion 18 or the outer extension portion 26 (or, in an unusual alternative embodiment, the base inner portion 20). The illustrations of FIGS. 15 and 16 suppose that the supporting member is an outer extension portion 26 as seen in FIG. 1. The supporting member 60 in this alternative embodiment preferably is a solid aluminum rod. In this disclosure, the “distal” end of the supporting member 60 refers to the free end of the member to the right side of FIGS. 15 and 16, and “distal” or “distally” refers to a direction facing or toward the distal end. The “proximate end” of the supporting member is to the left, and would in one embodiment be connected to the base inner portion 20 by means of the intermediate extension portion 28. “Proximal” or “proximately” herein refers to the direction opposite “distal” as described above. The longitudinal central axis of supporting member 60 defines a central axis 61. Nearly all the components of the adjustable grip resistance assembly are arranged coaxially about this central axis 61, and the bearings 68, 69 and thumb screw 76 are disposed for rotation about the axis 61. Arranged on the supporting member 60 are a shaft collar 62, a resistance washer 66, a first bearing 68 and a second bearing 69. The shaft collar 62 may be about 0.5 inch in axial thickness, preferably is fabricated from machined aluminum, and has a threaded set screw hole 65 defined radially therein. The resistance washer 66 (e.g., approximately 0.1 inch in axial thickness) preferably is composed of a tough, durable, resilient polyelastomer. The bearings 68, 69 preferably are composed of polyethylene, and have a smooth low-friction contact with the supporting member. The first bearing 68 may have an axial extent of about 1.5 inches, and the second bearing 69 may have an axial extent of approximately 2.0 inches. (All dimensions herein are offered by way of illustrative example, not necessary description.) Unless affected by a bearing's contact with the shaft collar 62 (or, more preferably, the friction washer 66 on or adjacent the shaft collar), the bearings 68, 69 freely rotate around the supporting member or, stated differently, the supporting member can rotate freely within the bearings, the inside diameters of the bearings only slightly exceeding the outside diameter of the support member. The hand grip 86 is concentrically disposed exteriorly on the bearings 68, 69 (FIG. 15). The grip 86 may be covered with a resilient padding (not shown in FIGS. 15 and 16) for user comfort. Proceeding further along the member 60, toward the proximate end, are a spin lock 70 with roll pin 71, a wave spring washer 74, a thumb screw 76, and a dial member 80. The spin lock 70 may be composed of durable polyethylene, even the same material as comprising the bearings, and have an axial dimension of about 0.3 inch. The pin 71 may be a conventional steel roll pin. The wave spring washer 74 preferably is stainless spring steel and has an axial extent of about 0.08 to about 0.1 inch; it is not truly disk-shaped, but rather is mildly warped in one or two dimensions (relative to its central axis) so to serve as a “wave shaped” compression spring between the thumb screw 76 and the spin lock 70. Compression of the spring washer 74 biases the spin lock 70 toward the second bearing 69 while the washer 74 presses against the thumb screw 76. Small convex bumps may be defined on the distal face of the spring washer 74 for contact against the thumb screw. The action of the spring washer maintains a minimal but constant axial compression amongst the various components of the assembly, so that maximum compressive pressure (and thus resistance to rotation) is not achieved until the maximum reading (e.g., indicia “9”) is obtained at the window 89 in the dial member 80, as explained further hereafter. The thumb screw 76 may be fashioned, for example, from machined aluminum, and is about 0.4 inch in axial thickness. The dial member 80, approximately 0.23 inch thick, may be fabricated from a rigid durable metal alloy or plastic. As seen in FIGS. 15 and 16, the dial member 80 is axially adjacent to the thumb screw 76, with a slight (up to, e.g., about 0.375 inch) gap between them (depending upon the adjusted position of the thumb screw). It is observed that the foregoing components (except the roll pin 71, but including the shaft collar 62, resistance washer 66 and the bearings 68, 69) preferably are generally annular in their radial cross sections, and each defines axially there-through a respective central aperture through which the member 60 can be smoothly inserted. The tubular hand grip 86 (which may correspond to the right hand grip 32 of FIG. 1), between about 4 and about 5 inches long, is securely affixed to and around the bearings 68, 69, as with small screws, suitable adhesive, or the like. The grip 86 may be composed of nylon or other suitable material. When the apparatus is completely assembled, the bearings 68, 69 are contained concentrically within the interior of the tubular grip 86 (FIG. 16). A length (e.g., approximately 0.5 inch) of the distal end of the supporting member 60 is threaded (for example with an ½″-13 thread along threaded portion 63) for screwed engagement with the complementarily threaded interior of the central aperture of the thumb screw 76. When fully assembled, the components of the adjustable grip resistance assembly are maintained in axial position (with only a minor amount of longitudinal “play”) upon the supporting member 60. The proper axial positions are maintained by means (at the proximate end) of a conventional set screw (not shown) disposed through a set screw hole 65 in the shaft collar 62, for screwed engagement against the supporting member 60 to temporarily set the axial location of the shaft collar 62, also to prevent the collar from rotating upon the supporting member. Axial positions of the components also are maintained by means (at the distal end) of a terminal screw 88 (or suitable equivalent) that is disposed through a central attachment hole in the dial member 80 and screwed into a central, axial, hole 81 in the distal end of the supporting member 60, as suggested in FIG. 15. The foregoing elements can be installed initially on the supporting member 60, and are arranged in the order shown. It is observed that, for the sake of clarity of illustration, FIG. 15 shows various of the components of the variable resistance subassembly in a partially exploded (axially) depiction; in use, adjacent ones of the axially arranged elements are either in mutual contact or nearly so. However, FIG. 15 has an imaginary break through the grip member 86 and supporting member 60, and between the two bearings 68, 69, to signal that the grip 86 optionally may have an axial length different (e.g., slightly longer) from the combined axial lengths of the two bearings. Moreover, the inner faces of the bearings 68, 69, which are in confronting relation, may or may not be in contact with each other; because the grip 86 is fixedly secured to both bearings, the bearings 68, 69 rotate together as a functional unit with the grip 86 regardless whether the bearings are in mutual contact. Thus, the unit defined by the grip 86 and the bearings may have any suitable selected axial length. The shaft collar 62 can be situated upon the supporting member 60, with its distal face toward the proximal face of the resistance washer 66, and is releasably secured in location by means of a conventional set screw. The resistance washer 66 also is slipped into position along the supporting member 60, with its distal face in contact with the proximate face of the first bearing 68. The resistance washer 66 preferably is securely anchored to the shaft collar 62, as with a high-strength bonding agent such as LOCTITE® 420 adhesive, or other suitable adhesive such as an epoxy. Such installation is facilitated by sliding the shaft collar and the resistance washer over, around, and along the supporting member 60, with the supporting member disposed through central apertures through the collar 62 and washer 66. The diameters of the central apertures in the shaft collar 62 and in the resistance washer 66 preferably are slightly greater than the outside diameter of the member 60. The shaft collar 62 when fully installed does not rotate on the supporting member 60, there being a set screw (not shown, but according to knowledge in the art) tightened down against the surface of the supporting member by being screwably turned through the threaded, radially oriented, set screw hole 65. Due to frictional forces, the resistance washer 66 is not prone to rotation about the supporting member 60; most preferably, because the resistance washer is permanently adhered to the shaft collar 62, and the shaft collar is set against rotary motion, the resistance washer cannot rotate about the axis of the supporting member 60. The first and second bearings 68 and 69 may then be installed in that order upon the supporting member 60. The first and second bearings 68, 69 with grip 86 thereon may then be slid upon the supporting member 60 by sliding the member through the central apertures in the bearings, which apertures have diameters only slightly greater than the outside diameter of the supporting member. In the fully assembled apparatus, the distal face of the second bearing 69 may contact the spin lock 70. Properly situated, the bearings 68, 69 are freely and smoothly rotatable on the supporting member 60 and around its axis. The spin lock 70 is non-rotatably situated on the supporting member, and may be installed by sliding it along the supporting member. The spin lock 70 has a central aperture whose diameter is slightly greater than the outside diameter of the supporting member. Placement of the spin lock 70 involves sliding its keyway 92 over the roll pin 71. Roll pin 71 is securely situated at an axial location on the support member 60 (e.g., is inserted tightly into a radial hole in the support member) so as to extend a short distance (e.g., 0.01 inch) radially outward from the surface of the support member. The longitudinal keyway 92 along the central aperture 94 through the spin lock 70 slidably engages with the roll pin 71 in a manner to be described further, so as to prevent the spin lock from being rotatable upon the support member 60 about its longitudinal axis. The roll pin 71 is located axially along the supporting member such that when the apparatus is fully assembled for use, there is a predetermined distance between the distal face of the spin lock 70 and the proximate face of the dial member 80. The wave spring washer 74, whose central aperture has a diameter just greater than the outside diameter of the supporting member 60, may then be slipped onto and along the supporting member and into contact with the proximate side of the thumb screw 76. The installed wave spring washer 76 may, but need not, rotate somewhat upon the supporting member 60. Properly assembled for use, the wave spring washer 74 is in contact with both the distal face of the spin lock 70 and the proximate face of the thumb screw 76, while there is a rotary sliding contact, or more often a small gap, between the distal face of the thumb screw and the proximate face of the dial member 80 (which is secured in position by the terminal screw 88). The axial size of the gap between the dial member 80 and the thumb screw 76 depends upon the axial position of the thumb screw, as it is screwably movable axially along the support member threaded portion 63. The thumb screw 76 is screwed into position by threading it onto the member threaded portion 63; the thumb screw 76 has, along its axial length and circumferentially around its central aperture, screw threads complementary to the threads 63 along the distal end of the supporting member 60. Thus the member 60 has an outside diameter nearly equal to the diameter of the central aperture through the thumb screw 76. Properly installed in the finished assembly, the thumb screw 76 does not rotate relative to the supporting member, except in accordance with its movement when being screwed closer to, or farther away, from the dial member 80 and along the threads 63. The dial member is installed next to the thumb screw 76. The dial member 80 is secured onto the distal end of the supporting member 60 (FIG. 16) by means of turning the terminal screw 88 into the member screw hole 81. Properly installed in the finished assembly, the dial member does not rotate relative to the supporting member 60. The spin lock 70 and roll pin 71 serve to prevent the rotary motion of the second bearing 69 (with grip 86 thereon) from inducing unwanted rotation of the thumb screw 76 (via the intermediate wave spring washer 74). During the practice of the invention, the grip 86 is grasped in a user's hand, while the supporting member 60 rotates with respect to the grip; the grip is fixed to the bearings 68, 69, and the interior surfaces of bearings are smooth so to slide freely against the exterior of the support member. Accordingly, as the user moves the overall apparatus 10 in any of the ways described previously hereinabove, the supporting member 60 and the bearings 68, 69 rotate coaxially in relation to each other. However, in the absence of a spin lock 70, rotary movement of the second bearing 69 tends to impart undesirable rotary motion in the thumb screw 76 (as thumb screw is screwably/unscrewably movable along the threads 63). Inadvertent axial shifting of the thumb screw 76 is to be avoided, as deliberate rotation of the thumb screw is the mode for regulating and setting the grip's resistance to rotation (to be described further). Special reference is invited to FIGS. 17A and 17B, as well as FIG. 16. The roll pin 71 is secured on/into the supporting member 60 so to have a short length thereof, for example between about 0.0125 inch and about 0.009 inch, protruding radially from the exterior surface of the supporting member. The roll pin 71 is disposed at a predetermined location along the length of the supporting member 60, an appropriate distance from the distal end of the supporting member, so to be engagable with the spin lock 70 is at its proper place along the axis of the supporting member. The spin lock 70 has an inner wall defining its axial central aperture 94. As best seen in FIGS. 17A and 17B, a keyway 92 is defined longitudinally in the inner wall of the spin lock 70, in communication with the central aperture 94. The keyway 92 preferably opens to the distal side of the spin lock and has a blind proximal end, as indicated in FIGS. 17A-B; alternatively the keyway 92 may run the full axial length of the spin lock 70, so to open to both the proximal and the distal sides of the spin lock. When the spin lock 70 is properly installed upon the supporting member 60, the roll pin 71 extends into and engages with the keyway 92. The engagement of the roll pin 71 with the recess of the keyway 92 prevents the spin lock 70 from being able to rotate relative to the supporting member. However, because the keyway 92 has a longitudinal extent, the pin 71 can slide axially along the keyway, thus permitting the spin lock 70 to shift a short distance, to or fro, axially along the support member 60. Yet the arcuate extent of the keyway 92 corresponds generally to, or slightly exceeds, the diameter of the roll pin; this close engagement effectively prevents the spin lock 70 from rotating on the supporting member 60 and around their co-axis 61. In the operation of the apparatus, therefore, the second bearing 69 may freely and deliberately rotate in relation to the supporting member, and may have incidental rubbing contact with the nearby spin lock 70; but such contact does not impart any rotary motion to the spin lock 70. The thumb screw 76 thereby is protected from inadvertent undesirable rotary motion due to the rotation of the second bearing 69. Rotation of the second bearing during operation of the apparatus thus does not actuate the thumb screw 76. The adjustable grip resistance assembly provides a selectively adjustable resistance to the rotation of the hand grip 86 with respect to the supporting member 60. This is accomplished by controllably adjusting a friction force transmitted between the shaft collar 62 and the first bearing 68; in the preferred embodiment, the friction force is directly between the resistance washer 66 and the bearing. The thumb screw 76, by virtue of being screwed onto the member threads 63 near the distal end of the supporting member 60, can be moved longitudinally along the member 60 to the extent of the threads 63. For example, clockwise (as seen in FIG. 15) rotation of the thumb screw 76 shifts, with fine graduation, the thumb screw toward the proximate end of the member 60, i.e., toward the shaft collar 62; counterclockwise rotation moves the thumb screw distally along the threads 63, that is, “backs it off” axially toward the dial member 80. Regulation of the rotational resistance of the grip 86 is accomplished by the user's deliberate turning of the thumb screw 76. In the completed assembly, the shaft collar 62 is in intimate contact with or connected to the resistance washer 66, which abuts the first bearing 68 which abuts the second bearing 69, which in turn is in direct contact with the spin lock 90. As previously mentioned, in the completed assembly, the spring washer 74 is in contact with both the second bearing 69 and the thumb screw 76, and ordinarily is slightly compressed between them. Due to this serial chain of contiguous contacts among the elements of the assembly, screwed movement of the thumb screw 76 axially toward the collar 62 compresses the resistance washer 66 (between the collar 62 and the first bearing 68), thereby increasing the friction between the resistance washer 66 and the first bearing 68. Contrariwise, screwed movement of the thumb screw 76 axially away from the collar 62 reduces the resistance compression of the washer 66, thereby decreasing the friction between the washer and the first bearing 68. Because the resistance washer 66 undergoes little or no rotation, frictional drag between it and the first bearing 68 increases resistance to the bearing's rotation on the supporting member 60, and thus also the ability of the grip 86 to rotate relative to the supporting member. Similarly, the lesser the frictional drag between the bearing 68 and the washer 66, the more freely the supporting member 60 can rotate in relation to both the bearings and the surrounding grip 86. Thus, controllably rotating the thumb screw 76 toward the shaft collar 62 gradually increases the grip's rotation resistance, and counter-rotating the thumb screw 76 away from the collar and toward the dial member 80 gradually decreases, potentially to zero, the grip's rotation resistance. By selectively turning the thumb screw 76, the user or the user's therapist can regulate the ability of the supporting member 60 and the grip 86 to rotate coaxially in relation to one another. In a preferred embodiment, there is means provided for gauging the hand grip's resistance to rotation. Gauging the resistance to rotation permits the user to see and monitor the magnitude of the grip's rotary resistance, and to repeatedly re-set the apparatus to a selected desired resistance. The gauging means nevertheless allows the resistance to be controllably varied and temporarily established between selected settings. As explained previously, the magnitude of rotational resistance of the bearings 68, 69 and grip 86 in coaxial relation to the supporting member 60 is a function of the thumb screw's axial location along the axis 61, which is in turn determined by the user's controlled manipulation of the thumb screw 76. Thus, the rotational position of the thumb screw 76, relative to the axis 61, correlates directly to the rotary friction between the resistance washer 66 and the proximate bearing 68. A gauging means accordingly may include elements for visually monitoring and determining the rotary position of the thumb screw 76. Such a gauging or measuring means may include an operational relationship between the thumb screw 76 and the dial member 80. In this regard, attention is invited to FIGS. 16 and 18, illustrating that the thumb screw 76 has a plurality (for preferred example, nine) indicator labels 84 arranged (e.g., radially arrayed) on its distal face. FIG. 18 offers a view of the distal face of the thumb screw, and shows nine indicator labels 84 with indicia thereon. The labels 84 preferably are disposed equidistantly in a spoke-like circular arrangement, concentric to the axis 61, similar to the numbers on the face of a clock. Each indicator label 84 displays an appropriate insignia or mark, such as a number or letter; the numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.) or letters (e.g., A, B, C, etc.) are sequentially arranged (e.g., counterclockwise) on the face of the thumb screw 76. The total number of indicator labels 84 is at least three, and preferably about nine; their angular arrangement depends on their number; for example, nine labels 84 are separated by forty-degree angular intervals. The dial member 80 defines there through a window aperture 89. The window aperture 89 is offset from the central axis 61 (and thus from the center of the circular dial member 80) a distance approximately equal to the distances the labels 84 are located from the same axis 61. While the dial member 80 is secured by the terminal screw 88 in place upon the member 60, and does not rotate, the thumb screw 76 is rotatable about the central axis 61. Controlled rotation of the thumb screw 76 may bring any one of the indicator labels 84, e.g. one-by-one sequentially, into registration (axial alignment) with the window aperture 89, whereby a registration of any particular one of the indicator labels with the window aperture corresponds to a magnitude of the resistance to rotation. By rotating (or counter-rotating) the thumb screw 76 through 360 degrees, the user consequently can bring any selected one of the labels 84 into registration (axial alignment) with the window aperture 89. Such a registration corresponds to, and thus indicates, a particular magnitude of frictional resistance to rotation presented to the user by the apparatus 10. It may be desirable to calibrate after initial assembly, and perhaps occasionally as needed thereafter, the cooperative gauging function of the thumb screw 76 and window aperture 89. Calibration may be accomplished with the apparatus assembled. A possible calibration routine is here summarized. The thumb screw 76 is rotated to back it off till it obtains the distal end of the shaft threads 63, where it contacts the dial member 80 which is secured in pace by the terminal screw 88. So located a maximum distance distally from the shaft collar 62, the thumb screw does not compress the resistance washer, and the assembly is in the “minimal resistance” position. The terminal screw 88 is then loosened slightly, and the dial member 80 is rotated about the axis 61 until the “zero” one of the labels 84 (e.g., the indicia numeral “0”) is registered with, and visible through, the window aperture 89. With the thumb screw 76 in this zero- or minimal-resistance home position, and with the zero indicator label aligned with the window aperture 89, the terminal screw 89 is tightened down to the end of the member 60 and secured. When the thumb screw 76 is fully “unscrewed” along the threads 63, a zero indicator label 84 accordingly shows through the window aperture to indicate that the assembly is in the minimal resistance position. With the various components of the adjustable grip resistance assembly so arranged serially along the supporting member 60, and slipped toward the dial member 80 so each component contacts its adjacent component(s), the shaft collar 62 is released by loosening its set screw. The coaxial components of the adjustable grip resistance assembly are moved distally into mutual contact, and a 30,000th-inch (approximately) feeler blade (not shown) is placed between the resistance washer 66 and the first bearing 68. The shaft collar 62 is pressed against the feeler blade, and then secured in position upon the supporting member 60 by tightening its set screw. The feeler blade is then removed to complete the calibration of the assembly's gauging function. The longitudinal slack in the assembly (with the shaft collar so secured) provided by the temporary presence of the feeler blade permits the thumb screw 76 to be rotated to move toward the shaft collar 62, thereby to increase the assembly's resistance to rotation. In a preferred embodiment, the thumb screw 76 and complementary shaft threads 63 are configured such that a 360-degree tightening rotation of the thumb screw increases the resistance to rotation from minimum to maximum, while conversely a 360-degree counter-rotation decreases the resistance from maximum to minimum. The wave disc spring washer 74 distributes or relieves some pressure that would otherwise be imposed upon the bearing 69, so that the assembly's rotary resistance does not obtain its maximum prior to the maximum indicator label being visible at the dial 80. During a complete rotation of the thumb screw 76, it moves between its minimal-resistance home position and its maximum-resistance position. And during such a rotation, the different indicator labels 84 appear and disappear sequentially from view through the window aperture 89. Thus each particular indicator label indicia (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9) corresponds to a rotary (and thus also axial) position of the thumb screw 76, which is determinative of the magnitude of the assembly's relative resistance to rotation. The user thus can monitor the resistance to rotation offered by the apparatus. By observing which indicator label 84 is visible (completely or partially) through the window aperture 89 in the dial member 80, a user can evaluate the level (relative magnitude) of resistance. This permits the resistance to be selected and temporarily set by the user according to therapeutic or training dictates, and permits a user to consistently but repeatedly re-set the resistance to a desired level between usages.
