BACKGROUND 1. Field Aspects described herein relate generally to methods and apparatuses for securing a wearable item to an article. 2. Discussion of Related Art Wearable devices, such as activity trackers and other devices that may be adhered on to a person, are gaining increasing popularity. An activity tracking device, for example, is an apparatus used to monitor and/or track fitness-related metrics, such as distance traveled, calories burned, heart rate, type of activity performed and quality of sleep. Such devices may be synchronized to a computer or smart phone for longer term data tracking. It may be desirable to be able to secure the wearable device(s), or other wearable item(s), to a person in a manner that is easy and reliable. Holders for wearable devices, such as holsters or armbands for mounting or otherwise wearing mobile devices have been used for this purpose. Some holders include a single lever coupled to a coiled spring, for providing a biasing force to the lever. Such holders typically have a receptacle for receiving a mobile device or identification card. To mount the holder on to an article of clothing, the lever is pulled back to allow insertion of an edge of the clothing and the lever is then released, so as to clamp down on to the fabric via the coiled spring. SUMMARY The inventors have recognized that it would be beneficial to be able to secure a wearable item to a variety of different types of graspable articles (e.g., garments, clothing, bags, suitcases, brief cases, etc.) at various locations, in a simple, convenient manner. For example, embodiments of a clip, or securing apparatus, with a wearable item mounted thereon, may be able to be secured to a relatively thick article (e.g., coats, thick fabrics, heavy garments, boots, etc.) or a relatively thin article (e.g., blouses, thin fabrics, t-shirts, light garments, etc.), alternately, and in a manner that is easy and repeatable. For various embodiments described herein, the securing apparatus may be able to suitably hold on to a thick, rigid article, and may also be able to hold securely on to a thin, more flexible article, without concern that the apparatus will fall off or otherwise detach. In various embodiments, a securing apparatus may have a mounting portion, constructed for a wearable item (e.g., activity tracker) to be mounted thereon. For example, the mounting portion may have a receptacle for receiving a complementary structure of the wearable item. Or vice versa, the wearable item may have a receptacle structured to receive the mounting portion of the securing apparatus. The securing apparatus may also include a securing portion, having a first securing member and a second securing member, for receiving and coupling with an edge of a graspable article, such as a garment. In various embodiments, the stiffness of the first securing member may suitably vary from the stiffness of the second securing member. In some embodiments, the securing members are cantilevers, each having an anchored end and a deflecting end. In some cases, the securing members may be connected to one another. For example, the anchored end of one of the cantilevers may be connected to the deflecting end of another cantilever. Accordingly, the cantilevers of a securing portion of an apparatus may be configured to suitably deflect from respective equilibrium positions upon insertion of the graspable article into the securing portion. In an illustrative embodiment, a securing apparatus is provided. The securing apparatus includes a receiving portion constructed and arranged to receive a wearable item; and a securing portion adapted to receive and couple with an edge of a graspable article. The securing portion includes a first securing member having a first stiffness and a second securing member having a second stiffness, wherein the first stiffness is greater than the second stiffness. In another illustrative embodiment, a securing apparatus is provided. The securing apparatus includes a receiving portion constructed and arranged to receive a wearable item; and a securing portion adapted to receive and couple with an edge of a graspable article. The securing portion includes a first cantilever and a second cantilever, the first cantilever connected to the second cantilever, wherein at least one of the first cantilever and the second cantilever is configured to deflect upon insertion of the graspable article into the securing portion. In yet another illustrative embodiment, a method of securing a wearable item to a graspable article is provided. The method includes coupling the wearable item to a receiving portion of a securing apparatus; and inserting an edge of the graspable article into a securing portion of the securing apparatus such that at least one of a first cantilever and a second cantilever of the securing portion deflects upon insertion of the graspable article into the securing portion, wherein a stiffness of the first cantilever is greater than a stiffness of the second cantilever. Various embodiments provide certain advantages. Not all embodiments of the present disclosure share the same advantages and those that do may not share them under all circumstances. Further features and advantages of the present disclosure, as well as the structure of various embodiments are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure relates to a clip or other securing apparatus for securing a wearable item to a person. In various embodiments, the securing apparatus is able to accommodate entry of a variety of different types of graspable articles (e.g., relatively thin and/or thick articles) at various locations thereof, and be firmly secured thereto, in a repeated manner. This is in contrast with conventional clips where, upon repeated attachment to relatively thick articles, a portion of the clip may have a tendency to experience plastic deformation. As a result, the ability for a conventional clip to firmly hold a relatively thinner article may then be limited. Though, for embodiments described herein, the securing apparatus may be lightweight, yet structured so as to be able to hold, in multiple instances, relatively thick articles within a securing portion thereof, without compromising the ability for the securing apparatus to be firmly secured to relatively thin articles. That is, after substantial use of an embodiment of a securing apparatus to hold relatively thick, rigid articles, a user may still use the securing apparatus to suitably hold on to a relatively thin article without fear of the apparatus falling off. A wearable item, such as an activity tracker, electronic device, fashion piece (e.g., jewelry or other accessories), or other suitable item, may be appropriately mounted to the securing apparatus. In some embodiments, the securing apparatus includes a first securing member and a second securing member. The first and second securing members may act in cooperation to receive and/or couple with an edge region of a graspable article. In various embodiments, the stiffness of the first securing member may be different than the stiffness of the second securing member; although, in other embodiments, the stiffness of the first securing member is about equal to the stiffness of the second securing member. For more embodiments, more than two securing members having varying levels of stiffness may be employed. The securing apparatus, and various portions thereof, may be formed of any suitable material, or combination of materials. For example, the securing apparatus may include metal, stainless steel, plastic, etc. In some embodiments, the securing members of the apparatus are formed of the same material; in other embodiments, the securing members of the apparatus are formed of different materials. In some embodiments, one or more of the securing members may be structured as cantilevers that may be connected or otherwise coupled to one another. As described herein, a cantilever is a structure, such as a beam, that is anchored to a support at only one end. Accordingly, a cantilever has an anchored end and a deflecting end. When bearing a load, a cantilever transmits force to the support to which it is anchored. Upon application of a load to the cantilever, in general, minimum deflection of the cantilever occurs at the anchored end, while maximum deflection of the cantilever generally occurs at the deflecting end. In some cases, an anchored end may be affixed to a support structure that provides a foundation about which the deflecting end may bend or otherwise deflect. It can be appreciated that, for various embodiments of the present disclosure, an anchored end of a cantilever may itself translate from one location to another. That is, it is not required for the anchored end of a cantilever, or other securing member, to be completely fixed at a particular point in space. The structure to which the anchored end of a cantilever is attached or otherwise connected may itself be prone to bending or other movement. For example, the anchored end of one cantilever may be attached to the deflecting end of another cantilever. Accordingly, the anchored end of the cantilever, whether or not subject to an external load, may move along with any such movement of the deflecting end of the other cantilever. It can also be appreciated that a graspable article may be refer to any suitable article to which embodiments of a securing apparatus may be secured. For example, a graspable article may be a piece of clothing, garment, race bib, shoe, sock, suit, coat, jacket, or may be the flap of a bag, a strap, the brim of a hat, etc. The graspable article may be made of any suitable material, such as fabric, plastic, metal, non-woven materials, etc., having any suitable thickness. Referring now to the figures, FIG. 1 depicts an illustrative embodiment of a clip 100 having a first cantilever 110 and a second cantilever 120. The first cantilever 110 forms the bottom surface on the outside of the clip 100, and encloses the second cantilever 120, which is located on the inside of the clip 100. The first cantilever 110 extends from an anchored end 112, located at the rear R of the clip, toward a deflecting end 114, located at the front F of the clip. That is, maximum deflection of the first cantilever 110 is able to occur at the front F of the cantilever and minimum deflection occurs at the rear R of the cantilever. The second cantilever 120 extends from an anchored end 122, located at the front F of the clip, toward a deflecting end 124, located at the rear R of the clip. Here, maximum deflection of the second cantilever 120 is able to occur at the front R of the cantilever and minimum deflection occurs at the front F of the cantilever. As shown, the deflecting end 114 of the first cantilever 110 and the anchored end 122 of the second cantilever 120 are attached at the front F of the clip 100. In this embodiment, the first and second cantilevers 110, 120 are both made up of a sheet metal. In some embodiments, the deflecting end 114 of the first cantilever 110 is welded to the anchored end 122 of the second cantilever 120. For instance, the first cantilever 110 and the second cantilevers 120 may be separately formed (e.g., cast, shaped, dimensioned) and then affixed to one another via a welded attachment (e.g., laser weld). Though, it can be appreciated that the first and second cantilevers 110, 120 may be formed and attached in any suitable manner. For example, the entire clip 100 or securing apparatus may be formed as a single monolithic part and then appropriately shaped. In some embodiments, a bridge or other additional connecting structure may be provided between cantilevers, providing a coupled attachment. In some embodiments, cantilevers are attached together via an adhesive, a fastening device arrangement, or the like. As discussed above, maximum deflection of the second cantilever 120 is able to occur at the deflecting end 124, located at the rear R of the clip 100, and the second cantilever 120 is minimally deflected at the anchored end 122, located at the front F of the clip 100. As further discussed above, for various embodiments, the anchored end 122 of the second cantilever 120 may be able to move in space along with the deflecting end 114 of the first cantilever 110, as it deflects. In various embodiments, the relative stiffness of the first cantilever 110 and the second cantilever 120 may vary appropriately. For example, the stiffness of the first cantilever 110 may be greater than the stiffness of the second cantilever 120. That is, the amount of force required to deflect the first cantilever 110 a certain amount (e.g., in a downward direction) is greater in comparison to the amount of force required to deflect the second cantilever 120 the same amount (e.g., also in the downward direction). In the embodiment of FIG. 1, as discussed above, the first and second cantilevers 110, 120 are formed of the same material. The first cantilever 110 is wider and longer than the second cantilever 120 and, thus, has a greater amount of material in comparison to the second cantilever 120. By virtue of this difference in the amount of material, the first cantilever 110 exhibits a greater degree of stiffness than the second cantilever 120. Though, in some embodiments, the cantilever(s), or securing member(s), of the apparatus are not formed of the same material. In such cases, one of the materials may be intrinsically stiffer than the other, contributing to overall stiffness of the cantilever(s), or other securing members. The first cantilever 110 optionally has an opening 111 therethrough which allows access to the second cantilever 120 and/or other aspects of the clip 100. For example, it may be desirable for the second cantilever to be deflected further downward, or upward, relative to the first cantilever. Such an opening 111 may allow the position of the second cantilever 120 to be suitably adjusted. In addition, as discussed above, the stiffness of the first cantilever 110 may vary from the stiffness of the second cantilever 120. Thus, the presence of the opening 111 may allow for the relative difference in stiffness between the cantilevers to be closer or further than would otherwise be the case without the opening. As shown, the clip 100 includes, at its rear R, a connecting portion 130 and a mounting portion 140. The connecting portion 130 bridges the anchored end 112 of the first cantilever 110 with the mounting portion 140. In this embodiment, the connecting portion 130 forms a C-shaped arrangement with the mounting portion 140 and the first cantilever 110. The mounting portion 140 may be configured and arranged to receive a wearable item 200, such as an activity tracker or other suitable device. The mounting portion 140 may include any suitable structure that accommodates attachment and/or coupling of the wearable item 200 thereto. For example, the mounting portion 140 may have a structure that is complementary to a corresponding structure of the wearable item 200. In some embodiments, the mounting portion 140 may include one or more plates, leaves, rods, sheets, protrusions, or other suitable structure, that extend from the body of the clip and which can be inserted into a complementary recess of the wearable item. Or, the mounting portion 140 may include a recess, receptacle, or other suitable receiving structure, to which a complementary portion of the wearable item may be placed and/or coupled. In some embodiments, the wearable item may be coupled to the clip via a fastening device, such as a bolt, screw, hook and loop fastener, adhesive material, snap/interference fit arrangement, etc. Or, the wearable item and mounting portion of the clip may be coupled through a sliding, slotted arrangement. In this embodiment, the mounting portion 140 includes a sheet plate that extends outward from the connecting portion 130 so as to engage with or otherwise be coupled to the wearable item 200. As shown, the wearable item 200 has a slotted arrangement that includes a recess with an overhanging ledge. The recess and ledge are shaped so as to suitably receive and allow the sheet plate of the mounting portion 140 to slide and be secured therein. In some embodiments, the slotted arrangement includes a retaining feature, such as a ribbed structure for holding the mounting portion 140 in place upon insertion. Alternatively, the slotted arrangement may be configured such that the wearable item and the mounting portion of the clip may slide back and forth freely relative to one another. As discussed above, a clip or other securing apparatus may be constructed so as to accommodate insertion of various types of graspable articles, for example, relatively thin or thick garments. The clip may have a securing portion that includes a cantilever located on the inside of the clip and another cantilever located on the outside of the clip. In some cases, the cantilever located on the inside of the clip may have a lower stiffness in comparison to the cantilever located on the outside of the clip. In some embodiments, a relatively thin garment or similar material may be inserted into the securing portion of the clip. The lower stiffness cantilever, located on the inside of the clip, may be deflected downward to accommodate entry of the graspable article between the cantilever and the mounting portion of the clip. Though, when a relatively thick garment, or similar material, is inserted into the securing portion of the clip, both cantilevers may be deflected downward to accommodate entry of the garment therein. As further shown in FIG. 1, the clip 100 may be moved in a direction, indicated by the straight arrow, so as to be secured to a graspable article 10. That is, the graspable article 10 enters through the front F into a securing portion of the clip 100, toward the rear R, so as to be firmly positioned between the cantilevers 110, 120 and the wearable item 200. As further shown in the figures, the second cantilever 120 may include protrusions 126a, 126b for gripping and securing the graspable article within the securing portion of the clip 100, upon entry. In some embodiments, and as shown, the protrusions may be constructed such that a graspable article may easily slide overhead upon entry into the clip, yet may resist exit of the graspable article therefrom. For example, as shown in FIGS. 2-4, looking from the front, the protrusions may have a slanted surface that involves a gradual incline from the front toward the rear, accommodating entry of the graspable article. Though, looking from the rear, the protrusions may include a wall that provides a more abrupt resistance to movement of the graspable article toward the front F. Alternatively, the protrusions may be constructed as bumps that provide the same resistance to movement overhead regardless of the direction in which the graspable article is pulled or otherwise moved. FIGS. 2-3 depict an illustrative embodiment showing the insertion of an edge of a relatively thin graspable article 12 into a securing portion of the clip 100. FIG. 2 shows the thin garment 12 prior to entry into the securing portion, at the front F of the clip 100. Upon entry, a user moves the thin garment 12 inward toward the rear R of the clip 100. In some embodiments, the user may hold the clip 100 steady and pull the thin garment 12 inward so as to appropriately engage with the protrusions 126a, 126b of the second cantilever 120. In some embodiments, the user pulls open the first cantilever 110 to deflect downward, out of its equilibrium position, bringing the second cantilever 120 therewith. This creates a larger opening through which the garment 12 may be inserted, as both the first and second cantilevers 110, 120 are pulled downward, away from the mounting portion 140 and wearable item 200. Once the thin garment 12 is suitably in place, the first cantilever 110 is released so as to return back to its initial substantially non-deflected equilibrium state. Although, for thicker garments discussed below, the first cantilever 110 may remain in a slightly or substantially deflected state, away from its equilibrium position. As shown in FIG. 3, the second cantilever 120 remains in a slightly or substantially deflected state, away from its equilibrium position. The degree to which the second cantilever 120 remains deflected depends on the thickness and material (e.g., rigidity) of the garment. At this stage, the second cantilever 120 provides a biasing force that effectively pins the garment 12 against the mounting portion 140 of the clip 100 or the wearable item 200. The protrusions 126a, 126b of the second cantilever 120 provide additional structure for concentrating compressive forces provided by the second cantilever 120 against the garment, allowing for the garment to be firmly held in place. In accordance with various embodiments, upon appropriate insertion of the garment, or other graspable article, into the securing portion of the clip 100, each of the cantilevers 110, 120 may provide respective biasing force(s) upon the garment, depending on the degree of deflection from the natural equilibrium position(s). For example, if the second cantilever 120 is deflected downward, and the first cantilever 110 remains in its non-deflected, equilibrium position, the biasing force provided by the second cantilever 120 may be greater in comparison than the biasing force of the first cantilever 110. Though, if the first and second cantilevers 110, 120 are deflected a substantially similar degree, the relative amount of biasing force produced by each cantilever on the garment will depend on the respective stiffness of each cantilever. That is, as the stiffness of the cantilever(s) increases, for a given degree of deflection, the biasing force provided from the cantilever(s) to the graspable article also increases. Accordingly, in some cases, depending on the particular arrangement of the clip and garment to which the clip is secured, the biasing force acting upon the garment from the first cantilever 110 may be greater than the biasing force acting upon the garment from the second cantilever 120, or vice versa. As an example, for the instance shown in FIG. 3, the second cantilever 120 is deflected downward by the relatively thin garment 12, while the first cantilever 110 remains in a non-deflected, equilibrium position. In this case, the garment 12 is sufficiently thin such that the first cantilever 110 does not deflect outward. Accordingly, the first cantilever 110 provides little to no biasing force acting upon the garment 12, however, the second cantilever 120, by virtue of its deflection downward away from its equilibrium position, provides an appropriate biasing force upon the garment 12. On the other hand, FIG. 4 shows an illustrative embodiment where the edge of a relatively thick garment 14 is inserted into the securing portion of the clip. In this embodiment, both the first and second cantilevers 110, 120 are deflected downward so as to accommodate the presence of the thick garment 14. Here, the stiffness of the first cantilever 110 is greater than the stiffness of the second cantilever 120. As a result, the biasing force provided by the first cantilever 110 may be comparatively greater than the biasing force provided by the second cantilever 120. Similar to that with respect to the relatively thin garment 12, upon entry, a user may move the thick garment 14 inward from the front F of the clip 100 toward the rear R. For example, the user may hold the clip 100 while pulling the thick garment 14 inward, so as to appropriately engage with the protrusions 126a, 126b of the second cantilever 120. Alternatively, as is the case with the thinner garment 12, the user may pull the first cantilever 110 downward, so as to provide a comparatively larger opening to accommodate insertion of the garment 14. Once the opening provided by the first cantilever 110 is sufficiently large, the garment 14 may be inserted therein. When the thick garment 14 is in place, the first cantilever 110 is released so as to clamp back against the garment 14, toward its equilibrium position. Though, as shown in FIG. 4, the garment 14 is thick and rigid enough such that both the first cantilever 110 and the second cantilever 120 remain in a deflected state. Here, both the first and second cantilevers provide respective biasing forces that result in fixation of the garment 14 within the securing portion of the clip. That is, the garment 14 may be suitably secured between the first and second cantilevers 110, 120 and the mounting portion 140 of the clip 100. Further, the protrusions 126a, 126b of the second cantilever 120 may provide additional structure for concentrating compressive force of the second cantilever 120 against the garment, resulting in a more secure hold of the garment in place. As discussed above, conventional clips constructed to be secured to graspable articles often include a single clamping mechanism, for example, a single C-shaped lever having a certain stiffness. However, with repeated use, particularly when the lever is frequently bent back so as to be secured to thick, rigid materials, it may be possible for the lever to eventually deform plastically. When such permanent deformation occurs, the elastic restoring force that may be provided by the lever is effectively lessened, diminishing the ability for the lever to achieve an adequate hold on the article of interest. Further, when plastically deformed to a certain degree, the equilibrium position of the lever may be altered. Such an occurrence may further reduce its capacity to secure thinner articles thereto. That is, with overuse, a conventional clip may be prone to undesirable distortion, limiting the ability for the clip to be secured to certain types of graspable articles (e.g., very thin fabric). As a result, when secured to thinner types of articles, the clip may be prone to falling therefrom. Aspects of various embodiments described herein overcome this issue by the manner in which multiple securing members are constructed. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, the first cantilever 110 may be pulled downward so that the clip may suitably receive the relatively thick garment 14. The second cantilever 120 may also be deflected so as to accommodate further entry of the garment 14 into the clip. Though, due to the construction of the second cantilever 120 relative to the first cantilever 110, overall deflection of the second cantilever 120 may be limited. That is, even if the first cantilever 110 is deflected significantly (e.g., due to extreme thickness and rigidity of the garment 14, or overuse), the rear region of the first cantilever 110 may act as a back stop to limit excessive deflection of the second cantilever 120. Thus, the second cantilever 120 may be protected from undesirable plastic deformation thereof. Accordingly, in this embodiment, even if the first cantilever 110 becomes plastically deformed, the second cantilever 120 is still able to receive and suitably secure relatively thinner graspable articles. FIG. 5 depicts an illustrative embodiment of how a wearable item may be mounted on to a securing apparatus. As discussed above, and as shown, the wearable item 200 has a recess 210 shaped to receive the mounting portion 140 of the clip 100, as indicated by the dashed arrow. The recess is flanked by overhanging ledges 220 that form a slotted arrangement through which the mounting portion, having a sheet plate configuration may slide. The wearable item 200 may also include a protrusion 212, which may be suitably shaped to engage with an opening 142 formed in the mounting portion 140. In some embodiments, the protrusion 212 may have appropriate dimensions so as to fit within the opening 142, such that the wearable item 200 and the mounting portion 140 may be even more firmly secured. For example, the width of the protrusion 212 may complement that of the opening 142. Further, one or more edges of the protrusion 212 may be slightly slanted so as to be able to facilitate sliding into the opening 142, upon entry of the wearable item. Conversely, the edge(s) on the opposite side of the protrusion 212 may be shaped so as to resist removal of the wearable item 200 therefrom. It can be appreciated that other arrangements for mounting a wearable item on to a clip may be possible. For example, appropriate fasteners may be used to affix the wearable item to the clip. Other arrangements are also described herein. FIG. 6 depicts another illustrative embodiment of a clip 100 with a wearable item 200 mounted thereon. In this embodiment, the clip 100 includes first and second cantilevers 110, 120, each having a different stiffness. Similar to the embodiment of FIGS. 1-5, the first cantilever 110 extends around the outside of the clip 100 and the second cantilever 120 is located on the inside of the clip 100, relative to the first cantilever 110. Also similar to other embodiments described herein, the clip 100 includes a connecting portion 130 which serves as a bridge between the first cantilever 110 and the mounting portion 140. An additional connecting portion 132 may be provided between the first and second cantilevers 110, 120. Rather than the deflecting end 114 of the first cantilever 110 and the anchored end 122 of the second cantilever 120 being directly attached (e.g., via a welded attachment), the first cantilever 110 and the second cantilever 120 may be connected via a connecting portion 132 (e.g., curved bridge structure). FIG. 7 shows how the wearable item 200 may be mounted on to the clip 100. The recess 210 of the wearable item 200 is shaped so as to receive the mounting portion 140 of the clip 100. Here, similar to other embodiments described herein, the mounting portion 140 has a sheet plate configuration that extends forward from the connecting portion 130. In some embodiments, the width between walls 214 of the recess 210 may be as wide or slightly wider than the corresponding width of the mounting portion 140 of the clip 100. The wearable item 200 includes protrusions 212, shown as pegs, which may be fitted for insertion into corresponding holes of the clip 100, as indicated by the dashed lines. In some embodiments, additional features may be provided so that the wearable item 200 may be firmly mounted to the clip 100. For example, the mounting portion 140 may have ribbed and/or snap fit features that resist removal of the wearable item therefrom. For example, upon insertion of the protrusions 212 of the wearable item 200 into corresponding holes of the mounting portion 140 of the clip 100, an interference fit may be established between the protrusions 212 and the holes. Other such features for securing the wearable item to the clip may be employed. The manner in which the clip 100 secures to a graspable article may be similar to other embodiments described herein. For example, the securing portion of the clip 100 may include the first and second cantilevers 110, 120. A graspable article, such as an edge of a garment, may be inserted into the securing portion of the clip 100 at the front F. At this point, the graspable article may be pulled further into the clip 100 toward the rear R, causing deflection of the second cantilever 120 downward. Or, the first cantilever may be pulled downward so as to create more space for insertion of the graspable article therein. In some embodiments, upon deflection of the second cantilever 120 downward away from the device 200, the protrusions 212 of the wearable item 200 through the mounting portion 140 may be exposed. Accordingly, as the second cantilever 120 provides a biasing force back upward toward the device 200, the protrusions 212 of the device 200 may provide additional structure(s) for gripping of the graspable article therebetween. The combined biasing force provided by the second cantilever 120, and/or the first cantilever 110, against the protrusions 212 may result in a suitably secure hold on the article. Clips or securing apparatuses in accordance with embodiments described herein may suitably accommodate and grip a wide variety graspable articles. While the manner in which various embodiments of the present disclosure may function may be similar, it can be appreciated that the structure and/or arrangement of such apparatuses may differ. For example, in further embodiments of the present disclosure, a clip or other securing apparatus may be constructed so as to have a suitable wireframe structure. FIGS. 8-13 depict various illustrative embodiments of a wireframe-type clip 100 having a first cantilever 110 and a second cantilever 120. The clip 100 includes a connecting portion 130 located between the anchored end 112 of the first cantilever 110 and the mounting portion 140. The clip 100 further includes another connecting portion 132 located between the deflecting end 114 of the first cantilever 110 and the anchored end 122 of the second cantilever 120. As discussed above, the structure of the illustrative embodiments of FIGS. 8-13 appears different than that of the embodiments of FIGS. 1-7, though, the various components may provide function(s) similar to and in accordance with embodiments described herein. For example, a garment, or other graspable article, may enter into the securing portion of the clip 100 at the front F, and may move toward the rear R, so as to provide a secure hold on the article. The garment may be pulled into the clip 100, resulting in deflection of one or both of the first and second cantilevers 110, 120 downward away from the respective equilibrium position(s). In some cases, a user may pull the first cantilever 110 outward, so as to provide a suitably sized opening to accommodate insertion of the edge of the garment. When appropriate, the first cantilever 110 may be released so as to return closer toward its equilibrium position. Though, due to the presence of the garment, depending on the thickness and rigidity of the garment, the first cantilever 110 and/or the second cantilever 120 may remain in a deflected state, providing respective biasing force(s) against the garment. Similar to other embodiments described herein, the clip 100 may be suitably structured so as to accommodate and be secured to both thin and thick articles. For example, when the clip 100 is secured to a relatively thin garment, the second cantilever 120 may be deflected downward so as to provide an appropriate biasing force against the garment, with only limited or marginal deflection of the first cantilever 110, if at all. As a result, for such cases, the biasing force provided by the second cantilever 120 may be greater than the biasing force provided by the first cantilever 110. When the clip 100 is secured to a relatively thick garment, both the first and second cantilevers 110, 120 may exhibit substantial downward deflection, each providing a corresponding biasing force against the garment. In these instances, the biasing force provided by the first cantilever 110 may be greater than the biasing force provided by the second cantilever 120, for example, due to the stiffness and/or amount of deflection of the first cantilever 110. With repeated use, it may be possible for the first cantilever 110 to exhibit a certain degree of plastic deformation. Though, for arrangements such as those described herein, the ability to secure relatively thin garments remains uncompromised. It can be appreciated that securing members other than cantilevers may be used. In some embodiments, a securing member may include a spring-loaded lever, such as a bar, plate, rod, or other structural support, coupled to a coiled spring (e.g., wrap spring). For example, a first securing member may include a lever coupled to a coiled spring and a second securing member may include a cantilever, or vice versa. Alternatively, a securing member may include an actuator (e.g., pneumatic, electromagnetic, etc.) that imparts a suitable force upon the graspable article, when appropriate, for securing the article thereto. Other types of securing members may be possible, as appreciated by those of skill in the art. For various embodiments described herein, any type of securing member(s) may be employed. It can be appreciated that the use of two securing members is not a required aspect of the present disclosure. In various embodiments, more than two securing members (e.g., cantilevers, actuators, etc.) may be employed in any suitable configuration. For instance, securing members may be positioned in various orientations that are suitable for holding down or otherwise securing a graspable article to the clip. As an example, for a rather thick garment, upon insertion into the securing portion of the clip, two or more securing members, each having a relatively high stiffness, may be positioned so as to be able to grip multiple respective edges of the garment. For example, the securing members may grip the garment at edges located opposite one another, or adjacent to one another, resulting in a firm hold on the garment. Even more securing members, each having a comparatively lower stiffness, may also be provided, and may further engage with the garment upon insertion into the securing portion of the clip. The additional securing members may also be appropriately positioned so as to hold on to the garment at various locations. As discussed herein, the wearable item 200 may be affixed, coupled or otherwise secured to the mounting portion 140 of the clip 100 by any suitable manner. In some embodiments, the wearable item 200 may include a receptacle 210 shaped and dimensioned to be complementary to the mounting portion 140. For example, a portion of the mounting portion 140 of the clip may be inserted or slid into the receptacle 210 of the wearable item. Alternatively, the mounting portion 140 may configured to suitably clasp the receptacle of the wearable item. Or, reverse arrangements may be possible. For instance, the mounting portion of the clip may be a receptacle to which a portion of the wearable item is attached or coupled. As illustratively shown in FIGS. 8-10, the mounting portion 140 may include a substantially straight rod or arm that may be inserted into a complementary receptacle 210. In this embodiment, the receptacle 210 is a recess for receiving a suitably shaped rod. The rod and the recess may be suitably shaped and dimensioned. In some embodiments (not shown in the figures), the rod may be coupled to the wearable item via one or more attachment members of the receptacle. For example, the rod may include one or more protrusions or tabs, and the recess may include one or more trenches that are complementary in size and shape with the protrusion(s) or tab(s), suitable for forming a coupled interface therebetween. In some embodiments, more rods/arms may be employed, with one or more complementary recessed features. As further shown in the illustrative embodiment of FIGS. 11-13, the mounting portion 140 may include curved rods or arms, located on opposite sides of the clip 100, that are shaped to fit into a complementary receptacle 210 of a wearable item 200. Here, the receptacle may include an arcuate recess or groove for receiving the curved rods. In this embodiment, to mount the wearable item 200 to the clip 100, the curved rods may be spread slightly apart so as to achieve clearance for entry into the complementary receptacle. When suitably positioned, the rods are released so as to return back toward their equilibrium position. Accordingly, the biasing force provided by the curved rods clamp against the surface of the grooves, securing the wearable item 200 in place with the clip 100. In some embodiments, the receptacle 210 includes holes within which ends of the mounting portion 140 (e.g., curved rod) may enter and be optionally hidden from view. In some embodiments, such holes may extend through to the other side of the wearable item, for example, to allow for the attachment of one or more accessories. Such accessories may include a cord or necklace-type connection. In some embodiments, one or more of the securing members of the clip 100 may be suitably shaped so as to provide access to a portion of the wearable item. For example, as shown in FIGS. 8-13, the wearable item 200 may include a slot 230 that may allow for the wearable item to be opened or closed upon appropriate rotation or manipulation thereof. For example, a coin or similarly shaped item may be inserted into the slot 230 and, upon appropriate twisting, the wearable item 200 may be opened or closed. The wearable item may be opened and closed, for example, to replace batteries which may be contained therein.
