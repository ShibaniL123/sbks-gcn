Intermediate 6: 4-chloro-5-methylsulfonylisoindoline
Step 1: 4-chloro-5-aminoisoindolin-1-one
To a solution of 5-aminoisoindolin-1-one (2.96 g, 20 mmol) in chloroform (50 mL) was added N-chlorosuccinimide (2.67 g, 20 mmol), and stirred under reflux for 2 hours. The resulting mixture was evaporated, concerntrated and then purified by silica gel column chromatography to give 4-chloro-5-aminoisoindolin-1-one (2.58 g). Yield: 70%.
