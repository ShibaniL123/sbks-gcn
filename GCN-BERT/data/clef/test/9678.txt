Comparative Example 18: Synthesis of (S)-3-aminoquinuclidine.dinitrate
2-propanol solution (23.73 g) containing (S)-3-aminoquinuclidine (2.93 g: 23.2 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and 70% nitric acid (4.31 g: 47.2 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain (S)-3-aminoquinuclidine.dinitrate (5.71 g: 22.6 mmol, yield=98%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 140° C.
