FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the fields of eukaryotic cell culture and tissue engineering, and provides methods and a combination for eukaryotic cell culture and preparation, wherein a polymer of a spider silk protein is used as a cell scaffold material. BACKGROUND Spider silks are nature's high-performance polymers, obtaining extraordinary toughness due to a combination of strength and elasticity. Spiders have up to seven different glands which produce a variety of silk types with different mechanical properties and functions. Dragline silk, produced by the major ampullate gland, is the toughest fiber, and on a weight basis it outperforms man-made materials, such as tensile steel. The properties of dragline silk are attractive in development of new materials for medical or technical purposes. Dragline silk consists of two main polypeptides, mostly referred to as major ampullate spidroin (MaSp) 1 and 2, but e.g. as ADF-3 and ADF-4 in Araneus diadematus. These proteins have molecular masses in the range of 200-720 kDa. The genes coding for dragline proteins of Latrodectus hesperus are the only ones that have been completely characterized, and the MaSp1 and MaSp2 genes encode 3129 and 3779 amino acids, respectively (Ayoub N A et al. PLoS ONE 2(6): e514, 2007). The properties of dragline silk polypeptides are discussed in Huemmerich, D. et al. Curr. Biol. 14, 2070-2074 (2004). Spider dragline silk proteins, or MaSps, have a tripartite composition; a non-repetitive N-terminal domain, a central repetitive region comprised of many iterated poly-Ala/Gly segments, and a non-repetitive C-terminal domain. It is generally believed that the repetitive region forms intermolecular contacts in the silk fibers, while the precise functions of the terminal domains are less clear. It is also believed that in association with fiber formation, the repetitive region undergoes a structural conversion from random coil and α-helical conformation to β-sheet structure. The C-terminal region of spidroins is generally conserved between spider species and silk types. The N-terminal domain of spider silks is the most conserved region (Rising, A. et al. Biomacromolecules 7, 3120-3124 (2006)). WO03/057727 discloses expression of soluble recombinant silk polypeptides in mammalian cell lines and animals. The obtained silk polypeptides exhibit poor solubility in aqueous media and/or form precipitates. Since the obtained silk polypeptides do not polymerise spontaneously, spinning is required to obtain polymers or fibers. WO07/078239 and Stark, M. et al. Biomacromolecules 8, 1695-1701, (2007) disclose a miniature spider silk protein consisting of a repetitive fragment with a high content of Ala and Gly and a C-terminal fragment of a protein, as well as soluble fusion proteins comprising the spider silk protein. Fibers of the spider silk protein are obtained spontaneously upon liberation of the spider silk protein from its fusion partner. The small fusion unit is sufficient and necessary for the fiber formation. Hedhammar, M. et al. Biochemistry 47, 3407-3417, (2008) study the thermal, pH and salt effects on the structure and aggregation and/or polymerisation of recombinant N- and C-terminal spidroin domains and a repetitive spidroin domain containing four poly-Ala and Gly rich co-blocks. In vitro studies on the biocompatibility of recombinant spider silk are so far few, and the materials studied vary a lot in amino acid sequence, mode of production and format. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In a first aspect, the invention provides a method for the cultivation of eukaryotic cells, comprising providing a sample of eukaryotic cells to be cultured;applying said sample to a cell scaffold material; andmaintaining said cell scaffold material having cells applied thereto under conditions suitable for cell culture. The cell scaffold material comprises a polymer of a spider silk protein. In a second aspect, the invention provides a method for the preparation of eukaryotic cells, comprising: providing a sample of eukaryotic cells;applying said sample to a cell scaffold material;maintaining said cell scaffold material having cells applied thereto under conditions suitable for cell culture; andpreparing a sample of cells from said cell scaffold material. The cell scaffold material comprises a polymer of a spider silk protein. It has been found by the present inventors that a cell scaffold material comprising a polymer of a spider silk protein provides a beneficial environment for the cultivation of eukaryotic cells in a variety of different settings. Furthermore, this environment enables the establishment of cultures of cells that are otherwise very difficult, very costly or even impossible to culture in a laboratory, and for the establishment of cell-containing materials useful for tissue engineering and/or transplantation. In some embodiments thereof, the cultivation or preparation methods may be performed in conditions comprising maintaining the cell scaffold material having cells applied thereto in a serum-free medium. The possibility to culture cells in a serum-free medium affords a cost-efficient and controlled alternative to the use of serum-containing media and/or media containing specific growth factors or extracellular matrix (ECM) components. This type of culture media is often very expensive, sometimes even prohibitively so, and heterogeneous. In a third aspect, the invention provides a combination of eukaryotic cells and a cell scaffold material comprising a polymer of a spider silk protein. Such a combination according to the invention may be presented in a variety of different formats, and tailored to suit the needs of a specific situation. It is contemplated, for example, that the inventive combination may be useful as a cell-containing implant for the replacement of cells in damaged or diseased tissue. In some embodiments of the methods and combination presented herein, the eukaryotic cells are mammalian cells, for example human cells. In other embodiments, the eukaryotic cells are non-mammalian cells, such as insect or yeast cells.

Furthermore, in an embodiment, cells forming sporadic tissue, in particular connective tissue, are not included, since the role of connective tissue is considered to be fulfilled by the spider silk protein in this embodiment. For example, the main tissue of the heart is the myocardium, while sporadic are the nerves, blood, connective etc. Below follows a non-limiting listing of examples of organ systems, whose main tissue cells may be useful in the methods or combination disclosed herein.

Various different embodiments of the methods or combination disclosed herein may employ any sub-group or sub-listing of cells, or even individual cell types, from the above general listings of cell types and organ and tissue systems. In a more specific embodiment, said mammalian cells are selected from the group consisting of stem cells and cells from islets of Langerhans (e.g. beta cells). In a more specific embodiment, said cells are selected from embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, amniotic stem cells and progenitor cells, and may in particular be selected from embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. In yet a specific embodiment, said cells are embryonic stem cells. In yet a specific embodiment, said cells are adult stem cells selected from the group consisting of hematopoietic, neural, mesenchymal, mammary, endothelial, epithelial and olfactory stem cells, in particular selected from the group consisting of hematopoietic, neural and mesenchymal stem cells. In yet a specific embodiment, said cells are progenitor cells selected from the group consisting of neural progenitor cells, mesenchymal progenitor cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells. In yet a specific embodiment, the mammalian cells are neural stem cells (interchangeably denoted neural cortical stem cells), which may be provided as single cells or in the form of at least one neurosphere. In yet a specific embodiment, the mammalian cells are insulin-producing beta cells, which may be provided as single cells or in the form of at least one islet of Langerhans. In yet a specific embodiment, the mammalian cells are somatic cells, for example selected from the group consisting of hepatocytes, fibroblasts, keratinocytes and endothelial cells. The cell scaffold material used in the context of the present disclosure comprises a polymer of a spider silk protein or polypeptide, also denoted “spidroin”. In one of the embodiments of the cell scaffold material, said spidroin consists of from 140 to 600 amino acid residues and comprises a repetitive fragment of from 70 to 300 amino acid residues derived from the repetitive fragment of a spider silk protein; a C-terminal fragment of from 70 to 120 amino acid residues derived from the C-terminal fragment of a spider silk protein; and optionally an N-terminal fragment of from 100 to 160 amino acid residues derived from the N-terminal fragment of a spider silk protein. The spidroin consists of from 140 to 600 amino acid residues, preferably from 280 to 600 amino acid residues, such as from 300 to 400 amino acid residues, more preferably from 340 to 380 amino acid residues. The small size is advantageous because longer spider silk proteins tend to form amorphous aggregates, which require use of harsh solvents for solubilisation and polymerisation. The protein fragments are covalently coupled, typically via a peptide bond. In specific preferred embodiments, the spidroin for use in the cell scaffold material is selected from the group of proteins defined by the formulas NT-REP-CT and REP-CT. The (optional) NT fragment has a high degree of similarity to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of spider silk proteins. As shown in FIG. 1, this amino acid sequence is well conserved among various species and spider silk proteins, including MaSp1 and MaSp2. See also the following Table 1: TABLE 1 Spidroin NT fragments GenBank Code Species and spidroin acc. no.

Thus, the NT fragment according to the invention can be selected from any of the amino acid sequences shown in FIG. 1 or sequences with a high degree of similarity. A wide variety of N-terminal sequences can be used as spidroin in the cell scaffold material disclosed herein. Based on the homologous sequences of FIG. 1, the following sequence constitutes a consensus NT amino acid sequence: (SEQ ID NO: 8) QANTPWSSPNLADAFINSF(M/L)SA(A/I)SSSGAFSADQLDDMSTIG (D/N/Q)TLMSAMD(N/S/K)MGRSG(K/R)STKSKLQALNMAFASSMA EIAAAESGG(G/Q)SVGVKTNAISDALSSAFYQTTGSVNPQFV(N/S)E IRSLI(G/N)M(F/L)(A/S)QASANEV. The sequence of the NT fragment has at least 50% identity, preferably at least 60% identity, to the consensus amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:8, which is based on the amino acid sequences of FIG. 1. In a preferred embodiment, the sequence of the NT fragment has at least 65% identity, preferably at least 70% identity, to the consensus amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:8. In preferred embodiments, the NT fragment has furthermore 70%, preferably 80%, similarity to the consensus amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:8. A representative NT fragment in a protein for use in the cell scaffold material disclosed herein is the Euprosthenops australis sequence SEQ ID NO:6. According to an embodiment, the NT fragment has at least 80% identity to SEQ ID NO:6 or any individual amino acid sequence in FIG. 1. For example, the NT fragment has at least 90%, such as at least 95% identity, to SEQ ID NO:6 or any individual amino acid sequence in FIG. 1. The NT fragment may be identical to SEQ ID NO:6 or any individual amino acid sequence in FIG. 1, in particular to Ea MaSp1. The NT fragment contains from 100 to 160 amino acid residues. It is preferred that the NT fragment contains at least 100, or more than 110, preferably more than 120, amino acid residues. It is also preferred that the NT fragment contains at most 160, or less than 140 amino acid residues. A typical NT fragment contains approximately 130-140 amino acid residues. The REP fragment has a repetitive character, alternating between alanine-rich stretches and glycine-rich stretches. The REP fragment generally contains more than 70, such as more than 140, and less than 300, preferably less than 240, such as less than 200, amino acid residues, and can itself be divided into several L (linker) segments, A (alanine-rich) segments and G (glycine-rich) segments, as will be explained in more detail below. Typically, said linker segments, which are optional, are located at the REP fragment terminals, while the remaining segments are in turn alanine-rich and glycine-rich. Thus, the REP fragment can generally have either of the following structures, wherein n is an integer: L(AG)nL, such as LA1G1A2G2A3G3A4G4A5G5L; L(AG)nAL, such as LA1G1A2G2A3G3A4G4A5G5A6L; L(GA)nL, such as LG1A1G2A2G3A3G4A4G5A5L; or L(GA)nGL, such as LG1A1G2A2G3A3G4A4G5A5G6L. It follows that it is not critical whether an alanine-rich or a glycine-rich segment is adjacent to the N-terminal or C-terminal linker segments. It is preferred that n is an integer from 2 to 10, preferably from 2 to 8, also preferably from 4 to 8, more preferred from 4 to 6, i.e. n=4, n=5 or n=6. In some embodiments, the alanine content of the REP fragment is above 20%, preferably above 25%, more preferably above 30%, and below 50%, preferably below 40%, more preferably below 35%. It is contemplated that a higher alanine content provides a stiffer and/or stronger and/or less extendible fiber. In certain embodiments, the REP fragment is void of proline residues, i.e. there are no Pro residues in the REP fragment. Turning now to the segments that constitute the REP fragment, it is emphasized that each segment is individual, i.e. any two A segments, any two G segments or any two L segments of a specific REP fragment may be identical or may not be identical. Thus, it is not a general feature of the spidroin that each type of segment is identical within a specific REP fragment. Rather, the following disclosure provides the skilled person with guidelines how to design individual segments and gather them into a REP fragment, which is a part of a functional spider silk protein useful in a cell scaffold material. Each individual A segment is an amino acid sequence having from 8 to 18 amino acid residues. It is preferred that each individual A segment contains from 13 to 15 amino acid residues. It is also possible that a majority, or more than two, of the A segments contain from 13 to 15 amino acid residues, and that a minority, such as one or two, of the A segments contain from 8 to 18 amino acid residues, such as 8-12 or 16-18 amino acid residues. A vast majority of these amino acid residues are alanine residues. More specifically, from 0 to 3 of the amino acid residues are not alanine residues, and the remaining amino acid residues are alanine residues. Thus, all amino acid residues in each individual A segment are alanine residues, with no exception or with the exception of one, two or three amino acid residues, which can be any amino acid. It is preferred that the alanine-replacing amino acid(s) is (are) natural amino acids, preferably individually selected from the group of serine, glutamic acid, cysteine and glycine, more preferably serine. Of course, it is possible that one or more of the A segments are all-alanine segments, while the remaining A segments contain 1-3 non-alanine residues, such as serine, glutamic acid, cysteine or glycine. In an embodiment, each A segment contains 13-15 amino acid residues, including 10-15 alanine residues and 0-3 non-alanine residues as described above. In a more preferred embodiment, each A segment contains 13-15 amino acid residues, including 12-15 alanine residues and 0-1 non-alanine residues as described above. It is preferred that each individual A segment has at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably 95%, most preferably 100% identity to an amino acid sequence selected from the group of amino acid residues 7-19, 43-56, 71-83, 107-120, 135-147, 171-183, 198-211, 235-248, 266-279, 294-306, 330-342, 357-370, 394-406, 421-434, 458-470, 489-502, 517-529, 553-566, 581-594, 618-630, 648-661, 676-688, 712-725, 740-752, 776-789, 804-816, 840-853, 868-880, 904-917, 932-945, 969-981, 999-1013, 1028-1042 and 1060-1073 of SEQ ID NO:10. Each sequence of this group corresponds to a segment of the naturally occurring sequence of Euprosthenops australis MaSp1 protein, which is deduced from cloning of the corresponding cDNA, see WO2007/078239. Alternatively, each individual A segment has at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably 95%, most preferably 100% identity to an amino acid sequence selected from the group of amino acid residues 143-152, 174-186, 204-218, 233-247 and 265-278 of SEQ ID NO:3. Each sequence of this group corresponds to a segment of expressed, non-natural spider silk proteins, which proteins have the capacity to form silk fibers under appropriate conditions. Thus, in certain embodiments of the spidroin, each individual A segment is identical to an amino acid sequence selected from the above-mentioned amino acid segments. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is envisaged that A segments according to the invention form helical structures or beta sheets. Furthermore, it has been concluded from experimental data that each individual G segment is an amino acid sequence of from 12 to 30 amino acid residues. It is preferred that each individual G segment consists of from 14 to 23 amino acid residues. At least 40% of the amino acid residues of each G segment are glycine residues. Typically the glycine content of each individual G segment is in the range of 40-60%. It is preferred that each individual G segment has at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably 95%, most preferably 100% identity to an amino acid sequence selected from the group of amino acid residues 20-42, 57-70, 84-106, 121-134, 148-170, 184-197, 212-234, 249-265, 280-293, 307-329, 343-356, 371-393, 407-420, 435-457, 471-488, 503-516, 530-552, 567-580, 595-617, 631-647, 662-675, 689-711, 726-739, 753-775, 790-803, 817-839, 854-867, 881-903, 918-931, 946-968, 982-998, 1014-1027, 1043-1059 and 1074-1092 of SEQ ID NO:10. Each sequence of this group corresponds to a segment of the naturally occurring sequence of Euprosthenops australis MaSp1 protein, which is deduced from cloning of the corresponding cDNA, see WO2007/078239. Alternatively, each individual G segment has at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably 95%, most preferably 100% identity to an amino acid sequence selected from the group of amino acid residues 153-173, 187-203, 219-232, 248-264 and 279-296 of SEQ ID NO:3. Each sequence of this group corresponds to a segment of expressed, non-natural spider silk proteins, which proteins have the capacity to form silk fibers under appropriate conditions. Thus, in certain embodiments of the spidroin in the cell scaffold material, each individual G segment is identical to an amino acid sequence selected from the above-mentioned amino acid segments. In certain embodiments, the first two amino acid residues of each G segment are not -Gln-Gln-. There are the three subtypes of the G segment. This classification is based upon careful analysis of the Euprosthenops australis MaSp1 protein sequence (see WO2007/078239), and the information has been employed and verified in the construction of novel, non-natural spider silk proteins. The first subtype of the G segment is represented by the amino acid one letter consensus sequence GQG(G/S)QGG(Q/Y)GG (L/Q)GQGGYGQGA GSS (SEQ ID NO:11). This first, and generally the longest, G segment subtype typically contains 23 amino acid residues, but may contain as little as 17 amino acid residues, and lacks charged residues or contain one charged residue. Thus, it is preferred that this first G segment subtype contains 17-23 amino acid residues, but it is contemplated that it may contain as few as 12 or as many as 30 amino acid residues. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is envisaged that this subtype forms coil structures or 31-helix structures. Representative G segments of this first subtype are amino acid residues 20-42, 84-106, 148-170, 212-234, 307-329, 371-393, 435-457, 530-552, 595-617, 689-711, 753-775, 817-839, 881-903, 946-968, 1043-1059 and 1074-1092 of SEQ ID NO:10. In certain embodiments, the first two amino acid residues of each G segment of this first subtype according to the invention are not -Gln-Gln-. The second subtype of the G segment is represented by the amino acid one letter consensus sequence GQGGQGQG(G/R)Y GQG(A/S)G(S/G)S (SEQ ID NO:12). This second, generally mid-sized, G segment subtype typically contains 17 amino acid residues and lacks charged residues or contain one charged residue. It is preferred that this second G segment subtype contains 14-20 amino acid residues, but it is contemplated that it may contain as few as 12 or as many as 30 amino acid residues. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is envisaged that this subtype forms coil structures. Representative G segments of this second subtype are amino acid residues 249-265, 471-488, 631-647 and 982-998 of SEQ ID NO:10; and amino acid residues 187-203 of SEQ ID NO:3. The third subtype of the G segment is represented by the amino acid one letter consensus sequence G(R/Q)GQG(G/R)YGQG (A/S/V)GGN (SEQ ID NO:13). This third G segment subtype typically contains 14 amino acid residues, and is generally the shortest of the G segment subtypes. It is preferred that this third G segment subtype contains 12-17 amino acid residues, but it is contemplated that it may contain as many as 23 amino acid residues. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is envisaged that this subtype forms turn structures. Representative G segments of this third subtype are amino acid residues 57-70, 121-134, 184-197, 280-293, 343-356, 407-420, 503-516, 567-580, 662-675, 726-739, 790-803, 854-867, 918-931, 1014-1027 of SEQ ID NO:10; and amino acid residues 219-232 of SEQ ID NO:3. Thus, in preferred embodiments of the spidroin in the cell scaffold material, each individual G segment has at least 80%, preferably 90%, more preferably 95%, identity to an amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NO:11, SEQ ID NO:12 and SEQ ID NO:13. In an embodiment of the alternating sequence of A and G segments of the REP fragment, every second G segment is of the first subtype, while the remaining G segments are of the third subtype, e.g. . . . A1GshortA2GlongA3GshortA4GlongA5Gshort . . . . In another embodiment of the REP fragment, one G segment of the second subtype interrupts the G segment regularity via an insertion, e.g. . . . A1GshortA2GlongA3GshortA4GshortA5Glong . . . . Each individual L segment represents an optional linker amino acid sequence, which may contain from 0 to 20 amino acid residues, such as from 0 to 10 amino acid residues. While this segment is optional and not critical for the function of the spider silk protein, its presence still allows for fully functional spider silk proteins and polymers thereof which form fibers, films, foams and other structures. There are also linker amino acid sequences present in the repetitive part (SEQ ID NO:10) of the deduced amino acid sequence of the MaSp1 protein from Euprosthenops australis. In particular, the amino acid sequence of a linker segment may resemble any of the described A or G segments, but usually not sufficiently to meet their criteria as defined herein. As shown in WO2007/078239, a linker segment arranged at the C-terminal part of the REP fragment can be represented by the amino acid one letter consensus sequences ASASAAASAA STVANSVS and ASAASAAA, which are rich in alanine. In fact, the second sequence can be considered to be an A segment according to the definition herein, whereas the first sequence has a high degree of similarity to A segments according to this definition. Another example of a linker segment has the one letter amino acid sequence GSAMGQGS, which is rich in glycine and has a high degree of similarity to G segments according to the definition herein. Another example of a linker segment is SASAG. Representative L segments are amino acid residues 1-6 and 1093-1110 of SEQ ID NO:10; and amino acid residues 138-142 of SEQ ID NO:3, but the skilled person will readily recognize that there are many suitable alternative amino acid sequences for these segments. In one embodiment of the REP fragment, one of the L segments contains 0 amino acids, i.e. one of the L segments is void. In another embodiment of the REP fragment, both L segments contain 0 amino acids, i.e. both L segments are void. Thus, these embodiments of the REP fragments according to the invention may be schematically represented as follows: (AG)nL, (AG)nAL, (GA)nL, (GA)nGL; L(AG)n, L(AG)nA, L(GA)n, L(GA)nG; and (AG)n, (AG)nA, (GA)n, (GA)nG. Any of these REP fragments are suitable for use with any CT fragment as defined below. The CT fragment of the spidroin in the cell scaffold material has a high degree of similarity to the C-terminal amino acid sequence of spider silk proteins. As shown in WO2007/078239, this amino acid sequence is well conserved among various species and spider silk proteins, including MaSp1 and MaSp2. A consensus sequence of the C-terminal regions of MaSp1 and MaSp2 is provided as SEQ ID NO:9. In FIG. 2, the following MaSp proteins are aligned, denoted with GenBank accession entries where applicable: TABLE 2 Spidroin CT fragments Species and spidroin Entry Euprosthenops sp MaSp1 Cthyb_Esp (Pouchkina-Stantcheva, N N & McQueen-Mason, S J, ibid) Euprosthenops australis MaSp1 CTnat_Eau Argiope trifasciata MaSp1 AF350266_At1 Cyrtophora moluccensis Sp1 AY666062_Cm1 Latrodectus geometricus MaSp1 AF350273_Lg1 Latrodectus hesperus MaSp1 AY953074_Lh1 Macrothele holsti Sp1 AY666068_Mh1 Nephila clavipes MaSp1 U20329_Nc1 Nephila pilipes MaSp1 AY666076_Np1 Nephila madagascariensis MaSp1 AF350277_Nm1 Nephila senegalensis MaSp1 AF350279_Ns1 Octonoba varians Sp1 AY666057_Ov1 Psechrus sinensis Sp1 AY666064_Ps1 Tetragnatha kauaiensis MaSp1 AF350285_Tk1 Tetragnatha versicolor MaSp1 AF350286_Tv1 Araneus bicentenarius Sp2 ABU20328_Ab2 Argiope amoena MaSp2 AY365016_Aam2 Argiope aurantia MaSp2 AF350263_Aau2 Argiope trifasciata MaSp2 AF350267_At2 Gasteracantha mammosa MaSp2 AF350272_Gm2 Latrodectus geometricus MaSp2 AF350275_Lg2 Latrodectus hesperus MaSp2 AY953075_Lh2 Nephila clavipes MaSp2 AY654293_Nc2 Nephila madagascariensis MaSp2 AF350278_Nm2 Nephila senegalensis MaSp2 AF350280_Ns2 Dolomedes tenebrosus Fb1 AF350269_DtFb1 Dolomedes tenebrosus Fb2 AF350270_DtFb2 Araneus diadematus ADF-1 U47853_ADF1 Araneus diadematus ADF-2 U47854_ADF2 Araneus diadematus ADF-3 U47855_ADF3 Araneus diadematus ADF-4 U47856_ADF4 It is not critical which specific CT fragment is present in the spider silk protein in the cell scaffold material. Thus, the CT fragment can be selected from any of the amino acid sequences shown in FIG. 2 and Table 2 or sequences with a high degree of similarity. A wide variety of C-terminal sequences can be used in the spider silk protein. The sequence of the CT fragment has at least 50% identity, preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 65% identity, or even at least 70% identity, to the consensus amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:9, which is based on the amino acid sequences of FIG. 2. A representative CT fragment is the Euprosthenops australis sequence SEQ ID NO:7. Thus, in one embodiment, the CT fragment has at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, such as at least 95%, identity to SEQ ID NO:7 or any individual amino acid sequence of FIG. 2 and Table 2. For example, the CT fragment may be identical to SEQ ID NO:7 or any individual amino acid sequence of FIG. 2 and Table 2. The CT fragment typically consists of from 70 to 120 amino acid residues. It is preferred that the CT fragment contains at least 70, or more than 80, preferably more than 90, amino acid residues. It is also preferred that the CT fragment contains at most 120, or less than 110 amino acid residues. A typical CT fragment contains approximately 100 amino acid residues. The term “% identity”, as used herein, is calculated as follows. The query sequence is aligned to the target sequence using the CLUSTAL W algorithm (Thompson et al, Nucleic Acids Research, 22:4673-4680 (1994)). A comparison is made over the window corresponding to the shortest of the aligned sequences. The amino acid residues at each position are compared, and the percentage of positions in the query sequence that have identical correspondences in the target sequence is reported as % identity. The term “% similarity”, as used herein, is calculated as described above for “% identity”, with the exception that the hydrophobic residues Ala, Val, Phe, Pro, Leu, Ile, Trp, Met and Cys are similar; the basic residues Lys, Arg and His are similar; the acidic residues Glu and Asp are similar; and the hydrophilic, uncharged residues Gln, Asn, Ser, Thr and Tyr are similar. The remaining natural amino acid Gly is not similar to any other amino acid in this context. Throughout this description, alternative embodiments according to the invention fulfill, instead of the specified percentage of identity, the corresponding percentage of similarity. Other alternative embodiments fulfill the specified percentage of identity as well as another, higher percentage of similarity, selected from the group of preferred percentages of identity for each sequence. For example, a sequence may be 70% similar to another sequence; or it may be 70% identical to another sequence; or it may be 70% identical and 90% similar to another sequence. In some more specific embodiments of the methods or combination disclosed herein, the spider silk protein of the cell scaffold material comprises a spidroin selected from the group consisting of 4RepCT, RGD-4RepCT, RGE-4RepCT, IKVAV-4RepCT, YIGSR-4RepCT, NT4RepCTHis, 5RepCT, 8RepCT, 4RepCTMa2, NT8RepCT and NTNT8RepCT (see list of appended sequences below). In an even more specific embodiment, the spidroin is 4RepCT (SEQ ID NO:2) List of Appended Sequences SEQ ID NO: 1 4Rep 2 4RepCT 3 NT4Rep 4 NT5Rep 5 NT4RepCTHis 6 NT 7 CT 8 consensus NT sequence 9 consensus CT sequence 10 repetitive sequence from Euprosthenopsaustralis MaSp1 11 consensus G segment sequence 1 12 consensus G segment sequence 2 13 consensus G segment sequence 3 14 5RepCT 15 8RepCT 16 4RepCTMa2 17 NT8RepCT 18 NTNT8RepCT 19 RGD-4RepCT 20 RGE-4RepCT 21 IKVAV-4RepCT 22 YIGSR-4RepCT In one embodiment of the methods or combination as disclosed herein, said spider silk protein comprises a cell-binding motif. In connection with the cultivation of certain cells in certain situations, the presence of a cell-binding motif has been observed to improve or maintain cell viability, and the inclusion of such a motif into the cell scaffold material as a part of the spider silk protein is thought to provide additional benefits. In some embodiments, the cell-binding motif is an oligopeptide coupled to the rest of the spider silk protein via at least one peptide bond. For example, it may be coupled to the N-terminal or the C-terminal of the rest of the spider silk protein, or at any position within the amino acid sequence of the rest of the spider silk protein. With regard to the selection of oligopeptidic cell-binding motifs, the skilled person is aware of several alternatives. Said oligopeptide may for example comprise an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of RGD, RGE, IKVAV (SEQ ID NO:23), YIGSR (SEQ ID NO:24), EPDIM (SEQ ID NO:25) and NKDIL (SEQ ID NO:26). RGD, IKVAV and YIGSR are general cell-binding motifs, whereas EPDIM and NKDIL are known as keratinocyte-specific motifs that may be particularly useful in the context of cultivation of keratinocytes. The coupling of an oligopeptide cell-binding motif to the rest of the spider silk protein is readily accomplished by the skilled person using standard genetic engineering or chemical coupling techniques. Thus, in some embodiments, the cell-binding motif is introduced via genetic engineering, i.e. forming part of a genetic fusion between nucleic acid encoding the “wild-type” spider silk protein and the cell-binding motif. As an additional beneficial characteristic of such embodiments, the cell-binding motif will be present in a 1:1 ratio to the monomers of spider silk protein in the polymer making up the cell scaffold material. The polymer in the cell scaffold material used in the methods or combination described herein may adopt a variety of physical forms, and use of a specific physical form may offer additional advantages in different specific situations. For example, in an embodiment of the methods or combination, said cell scaffold material is in a physical form selected from the group consisting of film, foam, fiber and fiber-mesh. In the context of the present invention, the terms “cultivation” of cells, “cell culture” etc are to be interpreted broadly, such that they encompass for example situations in which cells divide and/or proliferate, situations in which cells are maintained in a differentiated state with retention of at least one functional characteristic exhibited by the cell type when present in its natural environment, and situations in which stem cells are maintained in an undifferentiated state. Furthermore, as is evident from the above disclosure, it is contemplated that cells may be provided in the form of single cells, or as part of a cellular structure or “micro-organ”. Cultivation of cells in the form of a cellular structure or “micro-organ” may entail maintenance of the entire structure in combination with the cell scaffold material.

EXAMPLES Example 1 Hematopoietic and Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Recombinant Spider Silk Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which are known to be extremely sensitive to unfavorable influences from their direct microenvironment, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which have been shown to adhere and grow on a variety of biodegradable natural and synthetic scaffolds, were cultured on recombinant spider silk matrices comprising 4RepCT as described above. HSC could be cultured on 4RepCT foam and maintained their ability to differentiate as well as their phenotype when compared to HSC:s cultured on Falcon 1008 plastic and retronectin-coated plates. MSC showed similar cell count and differentiation as compared to controls when grown on 4RepCT fibers, and retained their ability to differentiate into cells of mesodermal lineage, such as bone, cartilage and fatty cells, when grown on 4RepCT films and foams. Materials and Methods Expression of Recombinant Spider Silk Proteins The recombinant spider silk protein 4RepCT (SEQ ID NO:2) was produced as previously described (Hedhammar et al (2008), supra). Briefly, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Merck Biosciences) with the vector for 4RepCT expression were grown at 30° C. in Luria-Bertani medium containing kanamycin to an OD600 of 0.8-1 and then induced with isopropyl 13-D-thiogalactopyranoside and further incubated for up to 3 h at room temperature. Thereafter, cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) supplemented with lysozyme and DNaseI. After complete lysis, the supernatants from centrifugation at 15,000 g were loaded onto a column packed with Ni SEPHAROSE™ (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The column was washed extensively before elution of bound proteins with 300 mM imidazole. Fractions containing the target proteins were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). 4RepCT was released from the tags by proteolytic cleavage using a thrombin:fusion protein ratio of 1:1000 (w/w) at room temperature for 1-2 h. To remove the released HisTrxHis tag, the cleavage mixture was loaded onto a second Ni SEPHAROSE™ column and the flowthrough was collected. The protein content was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm. Scaffold Preparation Purified 4RepCT proteins were allowed to self-assemble into fibers as described in Stark et al (2007), supra. The fibers were then cut into smaller pieces before being used for culturing in non-tissue culture treated Falcon dishes (Falcon 1008). Films were prepared by coating of Falcon 1008 dishes with 0.5-2.0 ml protein solution and air drying to allow formation of a thin layer at the bottom of the dishes. In addition, some Falcon 1008 dishes were coated with foam, obtained after vigorous mixing of the protein solution, and allowed to air dry for 24 hours to form a 3D matrix on the bottom of the dishes. Dishes with fibers, films or foams were sterilized by exposure to 280 Gy γ-radiation, delivered by a 137Cs source (Gammacell, Atomic Energy of Canada, Ottawa, Canada). Hematopoietic Stem Cell Isolation and Culture Healthy Balb/c mice were killed and femurs removed. Bone marrow (BM) cells were flushed from femora with Hanks' balanced salt solution buffered with 10 mM HEPES buffer (HH; GIBCO). BM cells were either used directly or after lineage depletion with a lineage cell depletion kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions and cultured for 4 days, at 3×105 and 5×104 cells/dish, respectively, in serum-free DMEM (Wognum et al (2000), Hum Gene Ther 11:2129-2141), supplemented with murine stem cell factor (mSCF, 100 ng/ml; Immunex, Seattle, Wash.) and mIL-3 (30 ng/ml; Genentech, San Francisco, Calif.). Measurement of Surface Antigens Murine bone marrow cells, before and after culture in the presence of 4RepCT, were collected for phenotypic analysis. Briefly, cells were washed twice with Hanks' buffered HEPES solution (HHBS) containing 0.5% (vol/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma, St Louis, Mo.), 0.05% (wt/vol) sodium azide, and 0.45% (wt/vol) glucose (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) (HBN) and resuspended in 50 μl HBN containing 2% (vol/vol) normal, heat-inactivated mouse serum to prevent nonspecific binding of the monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and subsequently incubated for 30 minutes with MoAbs raised against the following surface markers: c-kit, sca-1, CD4, CD8, CD11b and B220 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). Cells were washed twice in HBN and dead cells were excluded from analysis based on propidium iodine (PI, Sigma) staining. Cell samples were measured using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer, and 10,000 list mode events were collected and analyzed using the Cellquest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). In Vitro Clonogenic Progenitor Assays 5×104 murine BM cells or 1×103 lineage depleted BM cells (lin−/−) were plated in Falcon 1008 (35 mm diameter) Petri dishes in 1 ml of serum-free semi-solid methylcellulose culture medium containing 0.8% (wt/vol) methylcellulose (METHOCEL™ A4M Premium grade, Dow Chemical Co, Barendrecht, The Netherlands) in enriched DMEM, 1% (wt/vol) BSA, 0.3 mg/ml human transferrin, 0.1 μmol/l sodium selenite, 1 mg/l nucleosides (cytidine, adenosine, uridine, guanosine, 2′-deoxycytidine, 2′-deoxyadenosine, thymidine and 2′-deoxyguanosine; Sigma), 0.1 mmol/l β-mercaptoethanol, 15 μmol/l linoleic acid, 15 μmol/l cholesterol, 10 μg/ml insulin, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Granulocyte/macrophage colony formation (CFU-GM) was stimulated by addition of 10 ng/ml mIL-3, 100 ng/ml mSCF, and 20 ng/ml GM-CSF and scored at day 8-10 of culture. Burst-forming erythroid (BFU-E) growth was induced by 100 ng/ml mSCF and 4 U/ml human erythropoietin (hEPO; Behringwerke, Marburg, Germany) and counted after 8-10 days, whereas colony-forming unit erythroid (CFU-E) growth was stimulated with hEPO alone and counted after 2 days. Megakaryocyte progenitor cells (CFU-Meg) were stimulated in 0.275% agar cultures supplemented with 100 ng/ml mSCF, 10 ng/ml mIL-3m, and 10 ng/ml mTPO (Genentech, San Francisco, Calif.). Colonies were dried after 10 days and stained for acetyl cholinesterase positive cells, and enumerated. Mesenchymal Stem Cell Isolation and Culture Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) were purchased from Lonza (Verviers, Belgium). Cells were cultured in complete medium-1 (CM-1) consisting of 54% DMEM-LG, 36% MCDB-201, 10% FCS, 1 mM L-Glutamin and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Reyes et al (2001), Blood 98:2615-2625). Cells were trypsinized and subcultured when confluence reached 80-90%, and medium was refreshed every 3-4 days. Murine mesenchymal stem cells (mMSC) were obtained by flushing the femurs of Balb/c mice with HH. Full BM cells were cultured in the presence of DMEM-LG supplemented with 10% FCS, 1 mM L-Glutamin and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (CM-2). Adherent cells were subcultured and passaged once weekly. Medium was changed every 3-4 days. Differentiation Assays For adipogenic differentiation, MSC:s were cultured in the presence of adipogenic medium consisting of DMEM-LG, 10% FCS, 1 μM dexamethasone, 60 μM indomethacine, 500 μM isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) for 21 days and stained with Oil Red 0 (Sigma, St Louis, USA). For osteogenic differentiation, MSC:s were maintained for 21 days in osteogenic medium consisting of DMEM-LG, 10% FCS, 100 nM dexamethasone, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate and 0.2 mM ascorbic acid (Sigma, St. Louis, USA). Cells were stained with Alizarin Red S (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) to confirm presence of calcium phosphate deposits. For chondrogenic differentiation, 2.5×105 cells were spun down in a 15 ml polypropylene tube and the spontaneously formed three-dimensional pellet was cultured for 21 days in chondrogenic medium consisting of DMEM-HG (Gibco) with 100 nM dexamethasone, 10 ng/ml TGFβ3 (Peprotech, USA), 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 50 mg/ml ITS+Premix (Becton Dickinson, USA). Sections of the pellet were prepared for histological studies and stained with Alcian Blue for confirmation of chondrocytic lineage. Results Stem Cell Expansion and Differentiation in the Presence of 4RepCT Fibers In three separate experiments, performed in duplicate, the expansion of murine bone marrow cells in presence or absence of small pieces of 4RepCT was investigated. Results are displayed in Table 3, which shows the effect of 4 day culture in the presence of 4RepCT on expansion of murine bone marrow (BM) cells in serum-free medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml mSCF and 30 ng/ml mIL-3. Cells counted were colony forming units-erythrocyte (CFU-E); burst-forming unit-erythrocyte (BFU-E); colony forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM); and colony forming unit-megakaryocyte (CFU-Meg). No significant differences were found between cell numbers and amount of colonies formed after culture for 4 days in the presence of 4RepCT fibers in comparison to control wells.

All experiments were done in duplicates. 1Colonies per 1 × 105 BM cells 2Cells × 105 S.I.: stimulation index in comparison to day 0 values Murine MSC:s were maintained in culture medium until subconfluence and then trypsinized. 1×105 mMSC were cultured in 6-well plates in presence or absence of 1 cm pieces of 4RepCT fibers for 7 days and then trypsinized and counted. Control wells showed a 5.7-fold expansion after 7 days, whereas cells cultured in the presence of 4RepCT expanded 4.0-fold. However, only cells remaining in the culture dishes were trypsinized, and cells growing on the fibers were not included in the total cell count, thus leading to an underestimation of the actual number of cells present in each well. To prevent excretion of inhibitory signals due to contact inhibition in dense near-confluent cultures, after 7 days, 14 days and 21 days, the fibers were carefully removed from the culture dishes, rinsed once with PBS and transferred to a fresh well containing culture medium only. Cells arising in these culture dishes were thus all derived from a single source, i.e. the recombinant spider silk threads (FIG. 3). Human MSC:s were maintained in culture medium under similar conditions as the mMSC:s. Fibers were transferred to fresh culture dishes once weekly (FIG. 4). At day 21 of culture, 4RepCT fibers were removed. The remaining hMSC:s, which covered the surface of the culture wells and were derived from the recombinant spider silk fibers, were trypsinized and tested for their capacity to differentiate into adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineage (FIG. 5). All tests were done in triplicate. Cells derived from the 4RepCT fibers displayed a comparable differentiation capacity compared with hMSC:s from the same passage cultured in the absence of 4RepCT. Expansion and Differentiation on 4RepCT-Coated Tissue Culture Plates Murine bone marrow cells were lineage depleted (lin−/−) and cultured on culture dishes covered with 4RepCT foam in serum-free medium containing mSCF and mIL-3. Expansion of lin−/− BM cells and colony forming unit numbers, after 4 days of culture, were compared with cultures of lineage negative cells cultured on non-tissue culture treated dishes (35 mm, Falcon 1008) and Falcon 1008 dishes coated with recombinant fibronectin fragment CH-296 (Retronectin: RN; Takara Shuzo, Otzu, Japan) at a concentration of 10 μg/cm2. Results are shown in Table 4, for the number of in vitro burst-forming unit-erythrocyte (BFU-E); colony forming unit-granulocyte/-macrophage (CFU-GM); and colony forming unit-megakaryocyte (CFU-Meg).

Data are expressed as absolute cell numbers × 105. S.I.: stimulation index in comparison to day 0 values 1×105 senescent hMSC:s were plated onto non-tissue culture treated dishes (35 mm, Falcon 1008), tissue culture treated dishes (35 mm, Falcon 3001), tissue culture treated 6-well plates (Falcon) and dishes coated with 4RepCT film or foam (35 mm, Falcon 1008), and cultured until almost confluent. Cells were then maintained for 21 days in control medium, adipogenic differentiation medium or osteogenic differentiation medium. Results are displayed in FIGS. 6 and 7 for adipogenic differentiation and osteogenic differentiation, respectively. Cells cultured in the presence of adipogenic medium showed, independently of the coating of the dishes, a similar degree of adipogenic differentiation, having rounded cells containing multiple lipid vesicles divided equally over the surface of the dishes. In contrast, the senescent hMSC:s were no longer able to differentiate into osteogenic lineage despite regular medium changes with osteogenic differentiation medium, when cultured under any of the control conditions (FIG. 7A), but interestingly showed some patchy Alizarin Red S staining in the film and foam coated plates (FIG. 7B, upper left and right, respectively). This staining could not be attributed to staining of the 4RepCT itself, as plates coated with either 4RepCT film or foam, containing no cells, did not show any positive Alizarin Red S areas (FIG. 7B, lower left and right, respectively). Example 2 Human Embryonic Stem Cells on Recombinant Spider Silk The experiment shows the feasibility of culturing human embryonic stem cells on a recombinant spider silk material. Materials and Methods Standard six-well tissue culture plates were prepared. In the plates, three wells contained RGD-4RepCT film and the remaining three wells were empty. The 4RepCT film with the cell-binding motif RGD was prepared essentially as described in Example 1. The tissue culture plates were kept dry at room temperature until further use. In preparation for the experiment, the tissue culture plates were UV irradiated for 30 minutes in a Class II microbiological safety cabinet. The three empty wells in each plate were then coated with CELLstart™ CTS™ (Invitrogen; cat no A10142-01), as per manufacturer's protocol. Human embryonic stem cells (RCM-1, De Sousa et al, Stem Cell Res 2:188-197; Roslin Cells, Edinburgh, UK) were cultured on CELLstart™ with the serum and feeder free medium STEMPRO® hESC SFM—Human Embryonic Stem Cell Culture Medium (Invitrogen; cat no A1000701), as per manufacturer's protocol. The cells were passaged at a ratio of 1:6 from a 90% confluent well using STEMPRO® EZPassage™—Disposable Stem Cell Passaging Tool (Invitrogen; cat no 23181-010) as per manufacturer's protocol. Wells were washed with PBS, and medium was placed in all wells and preincubated prior to cell seeding. Cells at passage 64 were seeded into all wells of all plates at the recommended density, and care was taken not to disturb cells after seeding. All wells were cultured with STEMPRO® hESC SFM as per manufacturer's protocol. Incubation was done in a standard culture incubator at 37° C., 5% CO2 in air, at 95% humidity. Cells were observed daily and 100% medium exchanged every 48 hours. All medium was pre-equilibrated to incubator conditions for two hours prior to exchange feeding. At the end of study, wells were stained with Sigma-Aldrich: Alkaline Phosphatase (AP), Leukocyte (Sigma-Aldrich; Ref 86R-1 KT, Lot 019K4349) as per manufacturer's protocol. Results Selected images from the cell culture experiments are presented as FIGS. 8-12. All control wells showed the characteristics and morphology as would be expected with this hESC line under the control culture conditions employed. The RGD-4RepCT films were successful in sustaining cell attachment and expansion. Even though the growth was much slower than that seen in the control wells, this is thought to be a consequence of the cell line adapting to the new matrix. Cells showed, on initial cell plating, some adherence to the matrix, but non-adherent cells took on the appearance of Embryoid Body (EB) structures, which are seen when hESC:s are placed into non-adherent or low cluster plates to specifically derive EB structures for lineage and differentiation analysis. However, these EB like masses of cells did eventually adhere to the matrix, and from these “clumps”, cells were seen to grow and expand, suggesting adaptation to the new matrix. The cells of this study are continually grown and fed, and are expected to continue to expand. It is furthermore expected that the cells will be capable of passaging and expansion and can then be subsequently assessed for their pluripotency and differentiation status. The positive alkaline phosphatase staining indicates that the cells still exhibit undifferentiated stem cell characteristics. Example 3 Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells on Recombinant Spider Silk Background Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can be either feeder-dependent (i.e. they need to be cultured on a layer of mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MEFs) or feeder-independent (usually cultured on gelatin). mESCs need to be cultured with LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) present in the culture medium in order to remain undifferentiated. Their differentiation status (or maintenance of “sternness”) can be determined by staining of alkaline phosphatase activity (AP), since pluripotent cells express AP and thus stain positive, or by determination of the transcription of a set of differentiation markers (genes). Procedure Feeder-dependent mESCs (R1) in passage 17 were thawed and plated onto a layer of MEFs (irradiated, 1 day culture) in a 60 mm Petri dish in DM EM with glutamax (Invitrogen, cat no 31966-021) supplemented with 20% heat inactivated, ES-cell qualified FBS (Invitrogen, cat no 16141-079) and 5×105 units/ml of LIF (Chemicon, ESG 1107). After 2 days, cells were harvested and seeded onto different 4RepCT scaffolds prepared as described in the Examples herein (foam and fiber mesh of 4RepCT and foam and fiber mesh of RGD-4RepCT), as well as onto controls (MEFs or gelatin) in 12-well plates. The split ratio was 1:7. Medium was changed every day, and cells were split every second day (MEFs or gelatin) or every fourth day (4RepCT scaffolds). Longer split intervals were used for cells grown on scaffolds since they proliferated slower. To evaluate whether cells had maintained pluripotency or not, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 min and then stained for alkaline phosphatase activity (kit from VECTOR Laboratories) at the end of each passage (p19, p20 and p21), or after 3 days for cells on scaffolds in passage 21 (2 days for cells on gelatin or MEFs). Thus, cells that were maintained on scaffolds had been cultured for 4+4+3=11 days in total at the end of p21, whereas cells maintained on gelatin or MEFs had been cultured for 2+2+2=6 days in the end of p21. Micrographs were taken in an inverted microscope. Results mESCs grown on gelatin started to differentiate and lose morphology, whereas cells grown on MEFs showed maintained rounded colony morphology and stemness also after 3 passages. mESCs exhibited a lower degree of binding to both foam and fiber mesh compared to the binding to MEFs, as indicated by a lower number of colonies on all scaffold types compared to MEFs. The number of colonies growing on the scaffolds was approximately the same as the number of colonies growing on gelatin. Once bound to the scaffold material, cells grew and formed colonies on foam and fiber mesh, although some colonies tended to show a less smooth shape as compared to MEFs. Colonies looked similar to those on gelatin. After 4 days without split on foam and fiber mesh, colonies were very large and had partly started to differentiate (i.e. lose their AP positivity). In the third passage (p21), cells were allowed to grow on respective scaffold material for 3 days. Colonies maintained their AP positivity on foam, but showed signs of differentiation on fiber mesh. On 4RepCT foam, colonies were both more numerous and larger, as compared to on RGD-4RepCT foam (FIG. 13). With reference to FIG. 13, cells were stained for AP activity at day 3 (foam and mesh) and at day 2 (control and gelatin) of the 3rd passage on respective substrate (cell passage 21). Cells growing on 4RepCT (WT) foam showed a maintained stemness, as indicated by AP staining (dark grey colonies) similar to that seen for mESCs on MEFs (control). On the contrary, mESCs growing on fiber mesh showed a weaker staining, which is a sign of differentiation. Colonies on RGD4RepCT foam were smaller but AP positive, indicating less proliferation but maintained stemness. The differentiation seen in colonies on foam and fiber mesh after 4 days culture without split could be the result of colonies being overgrown and too large, but it could also be due to lack of factors secreted by MEFs, which the cells are dependent on to maintain their pluripotency. This is supported by the observation that cells maintained on gelatin without MEFs had also started to differentiate (already after 2 days). On fiber mesh, the cells started to differentiate after 3 days, at a point when colonies are still of sizes comparable to colonies on MEFs after 2 days. Conclusion mESCs show binding and proliferation on 4RepCT and RGD-4RepCT foam and fiber mesh. After 4 days, the mESCs on 4RepCT and RGD4RepCT foam and fiber mesh started to differentiate, possibly due to the large size of the colonies. However, when these cells were re-seeded onto newly prepared scaffolds and grown for 3 days, they maintained their stemness on 4RepCT and RGD-4RepCT foam, and the size of the colonies were similar to those seen on MEFs after two days. Slower growth was observed on RGD-4RepCT foam compared to 4RepCT foam. Cells maintained for 2 days on gelatin started to differentiate and mESCs on MEFs will also start to differentiate after 4 days due to large (overgrown) colonies. On 4RepCT foam, attachment, growth and maintained stemness were improved compared to gelatin. The results are surprising, since mESCs are normally dependent on factors provided by the MEFs to keep their stemness Example 4 Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) on Recombinant Spider Silk Materials and Methods Preparation of Wells Containing Scaffolds and Positive Control Wells 4RepCT, IKVAV-4RepCT and RGD-4RepCT were recombinantly produced and purified in analogy to the description in Hedhammar et al (2008), supra. One fraction of the protein solutions obtained was purified from lipopolysaccharides (Ips) as described in Hedhammar et al (2010), Biomacromolecules 11:953-959. The protein solutions were sterile filtered (0.22 μm) before being used to prepare scaffolds (film, foam or fibers) as described in Example 1. Half of the scaffolds were made from protein solutions depleted of lipopolysaccharides. Fibers were sterilized through autoclaving for 15 minutes at 121° C. in distilled water at 2.8 bar before being put into the cell culture plates. Scaffolds were prepared in hydrophobic 6-well cell culture plates (Sarstedt). As positive control, wells coated with poly-L-ornitine and fibronectin (PORN) were used. Representative schematics of the 6-well plates with “wild-type” 4RepCT are given below: Film, 4RepCT Film, 4RepCT Film, 4RepCT Coated, positive control Film, 4RepCT, lps Film, 4RepCT, lps Film, 4RepCT, lps depleted depleted depleted Coated, positive control Foam, 4RepCT Foam, 4RepCT Foam, 4RepCT Coated, positive control Foam, 4RepCT, lps Foam, 4RepCT, lps Foam, 4RepCT, lps depleted depleted depleted Coated, positive control Fiber-mesh, 4RepCT Fiber-mesh, 4RepCT Fiber-mesh, 4RepCT Coated, positive control Fiber-mesh, 4RepCT, Fiber-mesh, 4RepCT, Fiber-mesh, 4RepCT, lps depleted lps depleted lps depleted Coated, positive control In addition, similar plates were prepared by exchanging the “wild-type” 4RepCT scaffold with scaffolds made from IKVAV-4RepCT and RGD-4RepCT, respectively, making a total of 9 experimental plates. Two wells of a tenth six-well plate to serve as control plate were prepared using the following protocol: Addition of 2 ml of poly-L-ornithine solution to each wellIncubation over night in cell culture incubator at 37° C.Removal of poly-L-ornithine solution by aspirationWashing twice with PBS 1×Addition of 2 ml fibronectin solution per wellIncubation for 2-4 h in cell culture incubatorWashing twice with PBS 1× The remaining four wells of the plate were not coated, i.e. cells were seeded directly onto the polystyrene plastic surface. Thus, the control plate can be schematically represented as: Coated, Empty Empty positive control Coated Empty Empty positive control The above described material was used for culturing of NSCs in an undifferentiated state for 48 hours, whereupon the cells were differentiated into astrocytes. In addition, for a detailed investigation of neural stem cell (NSC) characteristics, a series of cell culture plates with 4RepCT films was prepared as follows: 3 six-well polystyrene plates (Sarstedt) with 4RepCT film in five of the six wells in each plate. The empty well and one additional well were coated with fibronectin and poly-L-ornithine according to the above. These plates were used for growing the NSCs in an undifferentiated state for 48-96 hours, after which the cells were differentiated into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons (cf below).Control plate: 1 six-well polystyrene plate (Sarstedt). The first row was coated with fibronectin and poly-L-ornithine according to the above, the second row was coated with BSA (bovine serum albumin), and the third row was left uncoated.Seven 35-mm polystyrene plates (Sarstedt) with 4RepCT film are prepared to specifically and accurately analyze the proliferation (cell division) rate and proportion of cell death.

NSC:s were cultured in 1 ml/962 mm2 of serum-free DMEM:F12 medium, enriched with N2 supplement and grown on poly-L-ornithine/fibronectin coated cell culture dishes. Cells were maintained in a proliferative state using 10 ng/ml FGF2 until reaching 80% of confluence, and passaged twice before use in experiments. After the second passage, cells were plated at 150000 cells/cm2 and allowed to proliferate for 48 h. To determine if the cells had remained undifferentiated, they were stained with nestin. To induce differentiation of NSCs, FGF2 was withdrawn from the cultures and fresh medium added along with either specific recombinant growth factors or small molecules to induce specific differentiation. For astrocytic differentiation, 10 ng/ml recombinant CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic factor) was added. CNTF and other factors of the interleukin-6 family (e.g., CT-1, LIF) induce a rapid (within 48 hours) and efficient (>>50%) differentiation of cortical NSCs into cells with an astrocytic morphology and positive for the archetypical astrocyte marker GFAP (Hermanson et al (2002), Nature 419:934-939), and it has recently been shown by calcium imaging techniques that these cells are functional astrocytes (Andersson et al (2011), Mol Cell Neurosci, Epub 14 Jan. 2011). For neuronal differentiation, either 0.5-1.0 mM valproic acid (VPA) or 10 ng/ml recombinant BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4) and 10 ng/ml Wnt3a were administered after FGF2 withdrawal. VPA induces a rapid (within 72 hours) differentiation of NSCs into 10-30% of early, electrophysiologically non-responsive cells with neuronal morphology, which are positive for the neuronal marker antibody TuJ1. Gene expression analysis of VPA-induced differentiated cells suggests that they initiate a differentiation program towards inhibitory (GABAergic) neurons. BMP4+Wnt3a induce a slow (5-14 days; herein 7 days) differentiation of NSCs into 10-30% of mature, electrophysiologically active cells with neuronal morphology, which are positive for all pan-neuronal markers, including TuJ1 (Leão et al (2010), PLoS One 5:e13833). Gene expression and physiological analysis of BMP4+Wnt3a-induced differentiated cells suggest that they initiate a differentiation program towards excitatory (glutamatergic) neurons. BMP4+Wnt3a treatment also results in increased astrocytic differentiation contributing to the mature phenotype of the neuronal cells, as compared to cells differentiated using VPA. For oligodendrocytic differentiation, 50 ng/ml of thyroid hormone (T3) was added. T3 induces an enhanced differentiation (1-20%) into cells with oligodendrocyte morphology, which are positive for most archetypical oligodendrocyte characteristic proteins (e.g. MBP) within 4-7 days. Although the differentiation is less efficient than that resulting from other protocols, it should be noted that the number of oligodendrocytic cells in control cultures (only FGF2 withdrawal) is very low, such as <<1%. Immunocytochemistry For immunocytochemistry, cultures were washed once with PBS and fixed using 10% formalin (Sigma) for 20 min. Next, cells were washed 3×5 min with PBS+0.1% Triton X100. The primary antibody was incubated over night at 4° C., (antibody dilution 1:500 in PBS+0.1% Triton X100+BSA 0.1%). Next, plates were washed 6×5 min with PBS+0.1% Triton X100, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibody. The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-smooth muscle actin (SMA) from Sigma (1:1000); rabbit polyclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from DAKO (1:500); mouse TuJ1 (to detect neurons) from CoVance (1:500), and rat anti-MBP (MAB386) from Chemicon (1:250) followed by appropriate species specific Alexa-488 and Alexa-594 conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes; 1:500). Nuclei were visualized using Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Fluorescent and brightfield images were acquired using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 mot plus/Axiocam MRm camera with Axiovision software. Proliferation Assay Cells were fixed with 10% formalin 15 min after the addition of 50 μM 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU; Invitrogen) followed by immunocytochemistry according to the supplier's recommendations. Cell Death Assay A Live/Dead kit (Invitrogen) was used to differentiate between living and dead cells attached to the scaffolds. Plates were rinsed twice with pre-warmed PBS (37° C.) before proceeding with the assay according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The assay enabled identification of live cells (green color) and dead cells (red color). Results Experiments on Proliferation and Viability of Neural Stem Cells when Grown and Expanded on Fiber-Mesh, Foam or Film, and Potential to Differentiate into Astrocytes, Neurons and Oligodendrocytes. Unless Otherwise Stated, all Experiments were Performed in Triplicates (n=3). After 48-72 h, NSCs proliferated normally on foam and film. In wells were a part of the plastic was exposed next to the film and foam, cells only grew on the films and foams. The morphology was indistinguishable from control cultures (poly-L-ornithin and fibronectin). When stained with nestin (48 h post seeding), the appearance of NSCs on 4RepCT film was indistinguishable from that of cells growing on poly-L-ornithin and fibronectin (FIG. 14). In wells with silk scaffolds that had been coated with fibronectin and poly-L-ornithine, the cells grew all over the plate wells, which is expected since also the plastic surface of the well is coated. No obvious or significant differences were seen at any stage beyond 48 hours in proliferation or cell death between NSCs grown on 4RepCT films compared to control. Also, no obvious difference was seen between NSCs grown on 4RepCT foam structures compared to control (n=1). In wells with BSA coating, the cells had not attached and were dying within 5 days, as expected. NSCs remained morphologically indistinguishable from stem cells in control cultures in the presence of FGF2 when grown on 4RepCT film and foam structures. They were viable (85% as determined by Live/Dead staining), proliferating (28% as determined by the EdU assay, controls 20-30%) and remained in an undifferentiated state, and no significant differences compared to control cultures (using poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin) were detected (FIGS. 14, 16 and 17). To test whether the NSCs remained multipotent with regard to differentiation capacity, a series of protocols to test differentiation into various neural lineages (e.g., neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) were applied as described in detail in the Methods section above. When NSCs grown on 4RepCT films were treated with CNTF as described in Methods, they differentiated rapidly and efficiently into cells with astrocytic morphology expressing the archetypical marker protein GFAP with no significant difference in efficiency, proliferation or cell death compared to control cultures (poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin) (FIG. 15) When NSCs grown on 4RepCT films were treated with BMP4+Wnt3a as described in Methods, they differentiated into cells with neuronal morphology positively stained with the archetypical antibody TuJ1 with no significant difference in efficiency, proliferation or cell death compared to control cultures (poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin) (FIG. 14). When NSCs grown on 4RepCT films were treated with VPA as described in Methods, they differentiated into cells with neuronal morphology positively stained with the archetypical antibody TuJ1. Whereas no significant difference in proliferation or cell death compared to control cultures were detected, a slightly lower efficiency in differentiation was observed (around 10-50% differentiated cells compared to control numbers). It has previously been observed that VPA-mediated differentiation is affected by substrate, likely due to the fact that the small molecule VPA, which, in contrast to recombinant growth factors, acts intracellularly, gets attached to and degrades on the substrate. Nevertheless, VPA-mediated neuronal differentiation of NSCs was indeed observed on 4RepCT films. When NSCs grown on 4RepCT films were treated with T3 as described in Methods, they differentiated efficiently into cells with oligodendrocyte morphology expressing the archetypical marker protein MBP with no significant difference in efficiency, proliferation or cell death compared to control cultures (n=2). It was observed that the MBP staining suggested a possibly less mature morphology than the cells differentiated under control conditions. It should be noted, however, that oligodendrocyte maturation is complex and that such an observation thus needs careful and extended analysis before becoming conclusive (FIG. 15). No significant differences in morphology, proliferation, viability, or differentiation capacity in any experiment were observed upon comparison between scaffolds made from the 4RepCT protein which had and had not been Ips depleted. Further, no obvious negative differences in morphology, proliferation, or viability were seen in NSCs grown on IKVAV-4RepCT or RGD-4RepCT (n=1). Example 5 Islets of Langerhans (A) and Single Beta Cells, Alone (B) or in Combination with Other Cells (C), on Recombinant Spider Silk Scaffolds Background Transplantation of the islets of Langerhans is one of the most promising approaches to finding a widely applicable treatment of severe type 1 diabetes. Unfortunately, currently available procedures suffer from low efficacy due to loss of function and survival of the pancreatic cells (Alejandro et al (2008), Transplantation 86:1783-1788). The low success rates are incompletely understood, but prior to transplantation, during islet isolation, the environment surrounding the cells is disrupted, which leads to a loss of vascularization and innervations and to altered interactions with the extracellular matrix. This has been implicated as a major cause of the limited survival and function (van der Windt et al (2007), Xenotransplantation 14:288-297; Kilkenny and Rocheleau (2008), Mol Endocrinol 22:196-205). The endocrine parts of the pancreas, unlike the exocrine part, do not produce a basement membrane of their own but rather depend on their surrounding environment, indicating again that the right niche might be of importance (Otonkoski et al (2008), Diabetes Obes Metab 10 Suppl 4:119-127). Another major obstacle to islet transplantation is the limited availability of beta cells due to shortage of donors. Beta cells, unlike many other cell types, have so far not been possible to propagate in vitro, since efforts to expand them result in dedifferentiation (Beck et al (2007), Tissue Eng 13:589-599). Thus, the establishment of an environment which is optimized for islets and beta cells is necessary, both for the study and propagation of pancreatic islets and islet-cells (beta cells), and for the design of an artificial islet/beta cell carrier for transplantation. In order to accomplish this, a highly versatile biomaterial is needed as a scaffold. Recently, success in producing a recombinant spider silk protein under physiological conditions was reported by the inventors' research group. Polymers of the protein can yield a strong and highly versatile material that can adopt various physical forms, e.g. three-dimensional fiber-meshes, foams or films. The stability of such “scaffolds” allows retrieval of cells for subsequent transplantation. Moreover, the scaffolds can be functionalized with specific cell binding motifs, suitable for adherence of e.g. beta cells. These properties make the protein an excellent candidate for the production of scaffolds that mimic the natural cell environment and thus provide support for islets of Langerhans and individual beta cells after isolation. Subsequent to transplantation, it is important that the islets are well adopted into the host environment, for example with proper vascularization. At the same time, negative host immune responses, e.g. instant inflammatory reaction, should be avoided. The formation of new capillaries requires endothelial cells, and of course these cells readily tolerate contact with blood. Mesenchymal stem cells can up-regulate the expression of important growth factors in endothelial cells and also produce proteases, and can thereby create pathways for new capillaries (Zacharek, A. et al. Neurosci Lett 404, 28-32 (2006)). The experiments described herein indicate that a personalized islet environment can be built up by using a functionalized silk scaffold, which allows adherence and combined growth of islet cells, endothelial cells (cf Example 6) and mesenchymal stem cells (cf Example 1). Experimental Material Recombinant spider silk protein, 4RepCT (SEQ ID NO:2), prepared essentially as described in Hedhammar et al (2008), supra, in the form of scaffold structures prepared as described in Example 1. The material was used in the original form 4RepCT, or in the form of variants modified by the incorporation of different cell-binding motifs related to the extracellular matrix, for example RGD, IKVAV, and YIGSR, or by the incorporation of the tripeptide RGE. In other variants, the spidroin N-terminal domain (NT) and a C-terminal His-tag were included, yielding a protein designated NT4RepCTHis (SEQ ID NO:5). Islets of Langerhans (human and rodent)Cells from human and mouse islets, e.g beta cellsEndothelial cellsMesenchymal stem cells Experimental Methods Cell Isolation Human islets of Langerhans were isolated at the Division of Clinical Immunology at Uppsala University, Sweden, by using a modified semi-automated digestion-filtration method and were thereafter cultured in CMRL-1066 medium with supplements and 10% human serum (Johansson et al (2008), Diabetes 57:2393-2401). Rodent islets of Langerhans were isolated by collagenase treated pancreata, digested by a continuous mechanic shaking, separated from exocrine tissue, and thereafter cultured in RPM I-1640 medium with supplements and 10% FBS (Nyqvist et al (2005), Diabetes 54:2287-2293). Single cells were prepared from islets from 10 months old obese mice or from islets from human donors. The single cells were isolated according to an accutase digestion protocol. In brief, 200 islets were pooled and washed twice with 1×PBS. Thereafter, 1 ml accutase was added to the islets. The islet-accutase suspension was incubated in 37° C. for 10-15 min with two steps of mild shaking, after which islet single cells were washed twice with 1×PBS and then plated and cultured on different variants of 4RepCT scaffolds in various physical forms, and without and with various peptide motifs. Cell Culture Human islets (20 islets/well) in combination with 4RepCT scaffolds were cultured in CMRL-1066 with supplement (Johansson et al, supra). Rodent islets (10 islets/well) and single islet cells in combination with 4RepCT scaffolds were cultured in supplemented RPMI-1640 medium (Nyqvist et al, supra). Commercially available, human microvascular endothelial cells were obtained and maintained in culture according to the provider's instructions in a well-known manner. Commercially available, human mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow were obtained and maintained in culture according to the provider's instructions in a well-known manner. Cell culture plates (hydrophobic plastic) were used as control for islets (as islets usually are cultured floating free in these plates). Tissue-culture treated plastic was used as control for growth of single cells. Adherence Assay A number (10-25) of islets were plated onto normal culture plastics as control and onto different variants of 4RepCT scaffolds and cell-binding motifs. Specific islet medium was used, and 4RepCT and islets were cultured for 5 days. During this time, adherent islets were counted every day. Medium change was performed on day 2 and insulin release was studied on day 5. Thereafter, the islets within 4RepCT scaffolds were cultured for up to 2 weeks, whereupon islet survival was analyzed. In one experiment using islets from a human donor, the islets were cultured for 12 weeks. Assessment of Function and Survival of Islets and Islet Cells Signal transduction, both in the individual islets and the islets' cells, both human and rodent, was studied subsequent to culture of the intact islets or islet cells under different growth, function and survival promoting conditions, and for different periods of time, in the various 4RepCT-based scaffolds. Islet cell growth, function and survival were monitored with the help of various fluorescent dyes and biosensors for specific steps in the signal transduction pathway. Several key events were tested: glucose metabolism, cytoplasmic concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), proliferation, and apoptosis/necrosis. It is also possible to test for example ATP production, exocytosis, and stimulus-induced insulin gene transcription. In Vivo Transplantation Islet and 4RepCT transplantation (e.g. into the anterior chamber of the eye) is done according to the method developed in P. O. Berggren's laboratory (Speier et al (2008), Nat Protoc 3:1278-1286; Speier et al (2008), Nat Med 14:574-578). In this way, the cornea is used as a window to study cell survival, function and integration in a living organism, under both physiological and diabetic conditions. Results A) Culturing of Islets The use of 4RepCT, both the wild type and variants modified by incorporation of different extracellular matrix related cell-binding motifs (e.g. RGD, RGE, IKVAV and YIGSR), may define an optimal environment for maintaining pancreatic islet function and survival after isolation. Islets were isolated from human pancreata (N=7) and mouse pancreata (N=10). The islets were cultured for from 3 h to 3 days in their specific medium and serum. Thereafter, they were plated onto different variants of 4RepCT (fiber, foam and film with incorporated peptidic motifs; none (wild-type; WT), RGD, RGE, IKVAV and YIGSR). Islets were also plated on NT4RepCTHis. Islets adhered spontaneously to the 4RepCT variants, as shown in FIG. 18A (human) and FIG. 18B (mouse). Empty culture plates (hydrophobic plastic) were used as control. From these results, a preferential adherence to the foam scaffold structure was observed, as compared to film and fiber (FIG. 19). Therefore, all tests of adherence and function were continued on foam scaffolds. Adhered islets were counted every day after plating until day 5. Islets adhered in different numbers, as shown in FIG. 20 (human islets, n=3 except for RGE where n=2; all experiments done in triplicates) and FIGS. 21A-B (mouse islets, n=4 (A) and n=1 (B); experiments done in triplicates). A comparison between different motifs was also performed, and a significant increase in adhesion was seen for 4RepCT comprising the motif RGD on days 2, 4 and 5 (FIG. 21A). Islets also adhered to NT4RepCTHis in an increased manner compared to the control (FIG. 21B). Islets in contact with 4RepCT were glucose challenged, and insulin release was measured on day 5. The results are shown in FIGS. 22A-F. Insulin was released from mouse islets cultured on 4RepCT (FIG. 22A-B; n=6; experiments done in duplicates). Mouse islets also released insulin when cultured on NT4RepCTHis (FIG. 22D; n=1; experiment done in triplicates). Human islets released insulin after glucose stimulation when cultured on 4RepCT (FIG. 22E; n=3; experiments done in triplicates). Not all islets adhered to the foam scaffolds, and therefore the adhered islets' insulin release function on days 2 and 5 was tested in separate experiments (FIG. 22C (mouse), FIG. 22F (human)). The glucose stimulated insulin release by the islets is similar after culturing in the wells coated with the 4RepCT scaffolds, with or without peptide motifs, and the control wells. This indicates that islets cultured with the 4RepCT scaffolds maintain their function. Also, islets cultured on NT4RepCTHis exhibited maintained function (FIG. 22D). The measured insulin release at the initial basal glucose (black bars) is higher in a few mouse experiments on 4RepCT scaffolds with or without peptide motifs, and this is believed to be a result of exposure to the initial culture medium, which is difficult to wash away from the scaffolds, and of a high variability between these experimental islets. The stimulation index (Stimulated insulin/Basal insulin) is measured separately in each well and shows that all islets on scaffolds responded to glucose by releasing insulin equally well as the control (FIG. 22B). The human islets cultured on 4RepCT scaffolds (with and without peptide motifs) showed a low basal insulin level regardless of cell-binding motif, and exhibited a satisfactory stimulated insulin release after high glucose challenge. The cytoplasmic concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was measured for islets cultured on scaffolds bearing different motifs. The islets responded to high glucose and showed an increase in Ca2+ as evidenced by ratiometric imaging analysis (FIG. 23). No difference between control islets and islets cultured on scaffolds was observed. Islets were cultured (medium change every second day) for 2 weeks. Thereafter, islets were counted and scanned for viability (e.g. necrosis). The islet morphology of islets on scaffolds was preserved after 2 weeks, whereas control islets exhibited islet degradation as visualized by a more irregular shape and suspended single cells (FIG. 24). Necrotic bodies were analyzed by light microscopy. More necrotic bodies were seen in the control islets, whereas islets cultured on 4RepCT scaffolds (with and without peptide motifs), both mouse and human, were more intact and viable. Islets from a young human donor were long-term cultured and tested for islet-like cluster formation and insulin release at day 5 and after 4 weeks and 12 weeks. Islets on the foam scaffold with the RGD motif exhibited an increased islet-like cluster formation after 4 weeks (Table 6). TABLE 6 Scaffold Number of islets and islet-like clusters 4RepCT 3 ± 1 RGD-4RepCT 71 ± 16 IKVAV-4RepCT 4 ± 1 YIGSR-4RepCT 6 ± 1 RGE-4RepCT 4 ± 1 Control 3 ± 1 These clusters adhered to the scaffold, and cells between the islets and islet-like clusters grew along the RGD-4RepCT scaffold structure (FIG. 25). Such cell growth between islets and along the foam structures was also seen on scaffolds having the YIGSR motif. Insulin release increased over time for scaffolds with RGD and was maintained in scaffolds with the YIGSR motif, and these results demonstrate satisfactory function compared to control islets after such a long time of culture (FIG. 26). Staining showed insulin positive cells in the islets and islet-like clusters (FIG. 27). B) Culturing of Beta Cells Alone Single cells (beta cells in majority) were isolated from islets of Langerhans from obese mouse pancreata (n=3) and from human islets (n=1). The single cells were plated and cultured for 3-7 days on different variants of 4RepCT (fiber, foam and film with the incorporated motifs: none (wild-type; WT), RGD, RGE, IKVAV and YIGSR). Morphology analysis showed that the single cells adhered in different manners onto different variants of 4RepCT. Long-term culture (over 2 weeks) of single cells was analyzed. Tissue-culture treated plastic served as control (FIG. 28A) and was compared to wells coated with film and foam of 4RepCT with incorporated cell-binding motifs, e.g. RGD (FIG. 28B). In all the different wells, single cells formed clusters of cells, as shown in FIG. 28. These clusters of cells differed in morphology, exhibiting scattered clusters e.g. in the control (FIG. 28A), and round clusters e.g. in 4RepCT with the RGD motif (FIG. 28B). The clusters were counted after two weeks and then saved for histological analysis, such as insulin staining. The results showed that the amount of round clusters found was enhanced in 4RepCT foam with RGD, and that these round clusters were insulin positive, as shown in FIG. 28C. These results indicate that 4RepCT can maintain islet beta cell function and enhance growth of round cell clusters that are insulin positive, compared to single cells cultured on normal cell-culture plastic. C) Culturing of Beta Cells in Combination with Other Cells Single mouse beta cells, human endothelial cells and human mesenchymal stem cells were plated alone or together and cultured on 4RepCT foam scaffolds with the incorporated motifs: none (wild-type; WT), RGD, RGE, IKVAV and YIGSR. The mesenchymal stem cells, when in culture alone, adhered to and grew along the structure of the scaffolds (FIG. 29). Single beta cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells grew on scaffolds of foam, and exhibited increased cluster formation on 4RepCT and RGD-4RepCT (FIG. 30). Transplantation of 4RepCT scaffold in combination with islets of Langerhans or islet cells is expected to show engraftment support. Conclusions Culturing of islets with the various 4RepCT scaffolds (having different formats and peptide motifs) allowed basic research regarding the development of potential treatment strategies of diabetes at the cellular level. Culturing of islets and islet single cells, such as beta cells, within a 4RepCT scaffold in different variants helps to maintain and increase their function in vitro. Culturing of composite cell populations (comprising islet beta cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells) within 4RepCT scaffolds has a potential as an insulin-making device if transplanted to a recipient using the recipients own endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. 4RepCT with islets, transplanted together into the anterior chamber of the eye of a mouse using a technique recently developed at Prof Berggren's laboratory is expected to improve islet engraftment and survival. Transplantation of a 4RepCT scaffold in combination with islets of Langerhans or islet cells is expected to exhibit engraftment support. The work described in this example accomplished the pre-requisites for the development of a transplantable, artificial insulin-producing device based on a 4RepCT scaffold (with or without peptide motifs). Example 6 Endothelial Cells on Recombinant Spider Silk The growth of blood vessels is essential for tissue engineering in regenerative medicine. Endothelial cells are responsible for vessel growth, and this process is triggered during certain circumstances, such as wound healing. In the body, there are many different kinds of endothelial cells depending on organ and tissue. The endothelial cells that are in close contact with the tissue are known as microvascular endothelial cells. Experimental Material Commercially available, microvascular endothelial cells were obtained and maintained in culture according to the provider's instructions in a well-known manner. Cell scaffold material comprising polymers of different variants of the 4RepCT protein was prepared into different physical forms as described in Example 1. The 4RepCT protein was used in unmodified, “wild-type” form without any additional cell-binding motif, as well as modified with the peptidic cell-binding motifs RGD, IKVAV or YIGSR. Experimental Methods Cells were added to the different scaffold materials and studied. A variety of assays were carried out on the cells, including a proliferation assay and a BD Pathway analysis (BD Biosciences). It is also possible to carry out for example cell function analysis, Live/Dead assay of apoptosis and necrosis, and histology analysis. Tissue-culture treated plastic plates were used as control. Results Results are presented in FIGS. 31 and 32. Endothelial cells adhered and grew in culture together with the different 4RepCT scaffolds. After 3 days of culture, their morphology was analyzed and the amounts of cells were counted. The morphological analysis showed that endothelial cells on 4RepCT scaffolds in different physical forms, with and without cell-binding motifs, adhered and were viable (FIGS. 31 and 32). Conclusions Endothelial cells were viable and could grow on 4RepCT scaffolds, as well as showing a proliferative capacity thereon. Example 7 Fibroblasts on Recombinant Spider Silk Experiments were done showing that scaffolds prepared from 4RepCT support the growth of anchorage dependent primary fibroblasts, that the cells survive, attach to the material and maintain one of their main functions, i.e. to secrete collagen type I. 4RepCT scaffolds show increased capacity to support cell growth compared to tissue culture treated plastics. Introducing the integrin binding motif RGD further improves this cell supportive capacity. Both growth on wildtype 4RepCT and RGD-4RepCT was shown to be independent of serum proteins. Materials and Methods Cell Culture Primary human dermal fibroblasts of neonatal origin, HDFn (ECACC/HPA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture F12 HAM (Sigma) supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum (Gibco), penicillin and streptomycin (National Veterinary Institute, SVA, Sweden) (FIGS. 34-36 and 38-41). In parallel experiments, (FIGS. 37 and 42), primary human fibroblasts (SF-HDF, PromoCell) were cultured in serum-free cell culture medium PC-1 (Lonza, Belgium) supplemented with 25 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma), and 5 mM L-glutamine (SVA). Cells were seeded onto 4RepCT scaffolds at the densities 3000 cells/cm2 or 15000 cells/cm2. All experiments were performed in passage 8 (with the exception of FIGS. 36 and 41, which were performed in passage 4) at 37° C. with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. Cell Culture Scaffolds After purification, recombinantly expressed 4RepCT (Hedhammar et al (2008), supra) with and without additional N-terminal cell binding motifs RGD, IKVAV and YIGSR, or the tripeptide RGE, was concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Amicon Ultra, Millipore) and sterile filtered (0.22 μm) before preparation of scaffolds in accordance with the description in Example 1. Likewise, recombinant NT4RepCTHis was prepared. Fibers were sterilized through autoclaving for 15 minutes at 121° C. in distilled water, 2.8 bar. Scaffolds were prepared in hydrophobic 96-well cell culture plates (Sarstedt) or cell culture chamber glass slides (LabTek). Wells without scaffolds were used as negative control (HP), and tissue culture treated plates as a positive control (TCT). The plates and chamber slides were allowed to dry over night at room temperature under sterile conditions with full speed fan. Scaffolds were washed twice with sterile PBS and pre-incubated with complete cell culture medium 1 h at 37° C. with 5% CO2 before cell seeding. Enumeration of Cells with Alamar Blue Cell growth on 96-well plate scaffolds was monitored with Alamar Blue cell viability assay (Molecular Probes) every second day during the culture period. After 4 h incubation with Alamar blue diluted 1:10 in cell culture medium, fluorescence intensity at excitation 544/emission 595 was measured in 100 μl supernatants from the cultures with a fluorescence plate reader (FarCyte, TECAN). A standard curve ranging from 50-64000 cells/well was established to enable recalculation of fluorescence intensity to cell numbers (live cells). Each scaffold type was analyzed in hexaplicate. Cellular Stainings Cells cultured on scaffolds in chamber slides were stained for either viable/dead cells, filamentous actin or collagen type I every third day during the culture period. The stainings were viewed under a confocal microscope (Leica), green fluorescence: excitation at 488 nm/detection at 500-530 nm, red fluorescence: excitation at 543 nm/detection at 620-660), and pictures were taken with Leica confocal software (LCS). Live/Dead Staining: Live/dead viability assay (Molecular Probes) was used to visualize living and dead cells growing on scaffolds. The cultures were washed twice with pre-warmed phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and stained with Calcein-AM and ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Filamentous Actin: Scaffolds were washed twice and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, AppliChem) in PBS, before staining with ALEXA FLUOR™488-Phalloidin (Invitrogen), 1:40 in 1% BSA in PBS. EthD-1 was used as nuclear staining. Slides were mounted in Fluorescence mounting medium (Dako, Copenhagen). Vinculin: Scaffolds were washed twice and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, AppliChem) in PBS, before staining with mouse anti human vinculin (Sigma V9131) at 9.5 μg/ml in 1% BSA, followed by ALEXA FLUOR™488 goat anti mouse IgG (H+L), cross adsorbed (Invitrogen) and ALEXA FLUOR™594-Phalloidin (Invitrogen), 1:40 in 1% BSA in PBS. DAPI was used as nuclear staining. Slides were mounted in Fluorescence mounting medium (Dako, Copenhagen). Collagen Type I: Scaffolds were washed twice and cells were fixed with acetone at −20° C. and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS before staining with mouse anti collagen type I (clone COL-1, Sigma-Aldrich) at 3.5 μg/ml in 1% BSA, followed by ALEXA FLUOR™488 goat anti mouse IgG (H+L), cross adsorbed (Invitrogen). EthD-1 was used as nuclear staining. Slides were mounted in Fluorescence mounting medium. Mouse IgG1 (clone B-Z1, BioSite) was used as Isotype control. Quantitative Determination of Secreted Collagen Type I Supernatants were collected from cultures every second day, diluted 1:10 and analysed for C-peptide, which is cleaved off from the procollagen type I molecule during its secretion into the cell culture medium, using the Procollagen Type I C-Peptide EIA Kit (TAKARA) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. OD450 was measured with Sunrise plate reader (TECAN), and data management with MAGELLAN™ software was used to achieve the concentration on C-peptide in the original samples. Data was recalculated to pg C-peptide secreted/cell. Results Cell Culture Scaffolds Prepared from 4RepCT Film, foam, fiber and fiber-mesh scaffolds were successfully prepared from 4RepCT protein solution (FIG. 33). Growth of Fibroblasts on 4RepCT Scaffolds 4RepCT scaffolds showed an increased capacity to support growth and expansion of primary fibroblasts compared to the TCT, as shown by the higher number of live cells present in scaffold wells after the initial phase of culture (i.e. from day 7 at the lower seeding density and from day 5 at the higher seeding density, FIG. 34). In the initial phase, however, the cells seem to grow somewhat slower on the scaffolds compared to the TCT. The number of living cells on the foam scaffolds is consistently lower than film and fiber-based scaffolds. However, the accessible scaffold area of the foam scaffolds is difficult to estimate, thus direct comparison to the other scaffold formats is not possible. By adding 4RepCT film under the fiber or fiber-mesh scaffolds, the supportive capacity increased even more (FIG. 35). We also demonstrated that the fibroblasts exhibited high live/dead ratios on the scaffolds, where film scaffolds showed close to identical growth pattern, cell density and live/dead ratios to cell culture treated glass slides (FIG. 36, right panels). Since the foam and fiber-based scaffolds stained red in this assay, we were able to see that the shape of living cells followed the morphology of the material. Serum-Free Culture of Human Fibroblasts on 4RepCT Scaffolds We have also shown that SF-HDFs (primary human fibroblasts expanded under serum-free conditions) are able to grow on 4RepCT film scaffolds with no serum present in the cultures (FIG. 37). This proves that the interaction of cells with the material is not dependent on serum proteins that have bound non-specifically to the surface, but that the scaffolds themselves present a hospitable surface for the cells to grow on. Attachment of Cells to Scaffolds During attachment of cells to the surrounding matrix, filamentous actin is linked to the membrane-bound receptors that mediate the binding. By staining intracellular filamentous actin, the binding points between cells and the underlying material can be indirectly visualized. With this method, we have been able to demonstrate that the HDFn actually binds to fiber (FIG. 38, left panel), fiber-mesh, film (FIG. 38, right panel) and foam scaffolds both during early and late culture (day 1, 4, 7, 10). Furthermore, through staining for vinculin in combination with filamentous actin, focal adhesions could be detected after 3 h culture of SF-HDF on wild-type (WT) film, RGD, IKVAV, YIGSR and NRC (NT4RepCTHis), (FIG. 43), under serum free conditions. These results indicate integrin-mediated adhesion to the different substrates. Collagen Type I Secretion by Cells Growing on 4RepCT Scaffolds The cells produced collagen type I when growing on all the different formats of 4RepCT, i.e. film, foam, fiber and fiber-mesh scaffolds. Thus, the cells maintain one of their important functions during culture in vitro on the 4RepCT scaffold material. The levels of secreted collagen (as measured by the C-peptide cleaved off during secretion) increased in the culture medium during the first 5 days of culture (FIG. 39, left upper panel). However, the amount of collagen produced per cell reached a maximum at 24-72 h post seeding, and was at this time point higher for cells growing on any of the 4RepCT scaffolds compared to the TCT (FIG. 39, right upper panel). Intracellular production of collagen was demonstrated to a similar extent on all scaffold types at day 1, 4, 7 and 10 post seeding (examples shown in FIG. 39, lower panel). Maintained Fibroblast Phenotype after Culture on 4RepCT Scaffolds To verify that fibroblasts maintained their phenotype after culture on 4RepCT scaffolds, cells were harvested from scaffolds after 14 days culture and reseeded onto either TCT for evaluation of collagen type I secretion, or onto glass for intracellular staining of collagen type I. Bo doing this it was demonstrated that the fibroblasts still produce (FIG. 40, lower panel) and secrete (FIG. 40, upper panel) collagen type I, and thereby do not lose what is one of their most important functions even after a relatively long-term culture on 4RepCT scaffolds. Fibroblasts Grown on Functionalized 4RepCT Scaffolds Preliminary data from Alamar blue viability experiments show that the introduction of RGD into 4RepCT increases the total number of living cells growing on the film and fiber-mesh scaffolds from day 3 and 1 respectively (FIG. 41). Over time, the number of cells also exceeds the cell counts present in TCT wells, i.e. from day 7. In a parallel set up, a serum free cell culture system were used, showing that even in the absence of serum, enhanced growth of primary fibroblasts was achieved on the RGD-4RepCT film, compared to 4RepCT without RGD (FIG. 42). Thus, introduction of RGD can improve the capacity of the scaffolds to support the growth of anchorage dependent cells markedly, and the effect is not dependent on serum components present in the cell culture medium. The results also indicate that the RGD motifs are properly exposed on the surface of the scaffolds. Example 8 Keratinocytes on Recombinant Spider Silk Experiments were performed to show that film scaffolds prepared from 4RepCT support the growth of primary keratinocytes, and that the cells adhere to the material and maintain their characteristic morphology. Both growth on wild-type 4RepCT and functionalized 4RepCT was shown to be independent of serum proteins. Materials and Methods Keratinocytes isolated from human skin were cultured in Keratinocyte SFM with supplement (Gibco), which is a serum-free set-up designed for the growth of keratinocytes. Traditionally, 10% fetal bovine serum is added to inactivate trypsin after harvesting the cells, to ensure binding upon re-seeding. In the current set-up, parallel experiments with and without this serum addition were performed. Keratinocytes were seeded at passage 4 (10000 cells/cm2) onto wild type and functionalized film scaffolds of 4RepCT as described in previous Examples. Functionalizations that were tested included the general cell-binding motifs RGD and IKVAV, but could also have included the general cell-binding motif YIGSR and/or the keratinocyte-specific motifs EPDIM and NKDIL. Keratinocyte-specific markers may furthermore be used to ensure maintained phenotype at the end of culture, and to determine differentiation status, e.g. keratin (K1, K5, K10, K6/K16/K17), filaggrin, Tob, G6K12, gp80 and MRP-8. Immunofluorescence staining for detection of vinculin (clone V9131, Sigma-Aldrich) in combination with filamentous actin (Phalloidin, Invitrogen) was used to identify focal adhesions, i.e. actual contact spots between the cells and the material, as described in Example 7 above. Effect on apoptosis will be evaluated with EnzChek Caspase3 Assay (Molecular Probes). Living cells were detected with Alamar blue (Molecular Probes) as described in Example 7 above. Results Primary human keratinocytes were cultured for 4 days on 4RepCT film with or without cell binding motifs. The cells survived and increased in cell numbers between day 1 and 4 (FIG. 44). They showed the characteristic morphology of keratinocytes on all materials during the full culture period (FIG. 45). Focal adhesions were detected on wild type, RGD and IKVAV films (analysed at day 4), indicating integrin-mediated adhesion to the tested materials (FIG. 46). The results were independent of addition of serum before seeding, thus, the cells bound to the material under strictly serum-free conditions. Example 9 Primary Hepatocytes on Recombinant Spider Silk The liver is an essential organ with unique functions. Currently, cases of acute liver failure, e.g. liver-based metabolic diseases and chronic liver disease, are rescued by either liver transplantation or liver cell therapy. Unfortunately, currently available hepatocyte therapy is not optimal, for example because many of the cells are lost and not engrafted during transplantation of hepatocytes. A scaffold, which serves as a host for hepatocytes and keeps them in place, could pre-engraft these cells prior to transplantation. This opens a new way of transplanting hepatocytes. Experimental Material Rodent hepatocytes were isolated by digestion of collagenase treated liver by continuous mechanic shaking, separated and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The recombinant spider silk protein 4RepCT described in previous Examples was used, both as wild type and in the form of variants modified by incorporation of different extracellular matrix related cell-binding motifs (e.g. RGD, IKVAV, YIGSR and RGE), and was prepared essentially as described in Hedhammar et al (2008), supra, in the form of scaffold structures prepared as described in Example 1. Cell Culture: Rodent hepatocytes in combination with 4RepCT scaffolds were cultured in supplemented RPMI-1640 medium. Assessment of Survival of Hepatocytes: The cells were plated on fiber and film scaffolds with incorporation of different extracellular matrix related cell-binding motifs (e.g. RGD, IKVAV, YIGSR and RGE). Cell morphology and survival was assessed over time in culture. Results Hepatocytes adhered to fiber and film scaffolds (FIG. 47). The hepatocytes were also able to survive in culture with 4RepCT. Example 10 Recombinant Spider Silk Protein Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering The experiment is expected to show that 4RepCT scaffolds enable regeneration of axons in spinal cord injuries in vivo. Both 4RepCT scaffolds without seeded cells and 4RepCT scaffolds combined with the engraftment of human neural cells and human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells are employed. Histological and behavioral analysis is used to document the results. Materials and Methods Animal Surgery The weight of rats is 170-200 g at the time of surgery. Animals are injected with Atropin (0.05 mg/kg i.p., NM Pharma AB) 30 minutes before surgery. Rats are anesthetized with a mixture of Hypnorm (fentanyl citrate, 0.22 mg/kg, and fluanisome, 6.8 mg/kg, Janssen Pharmaceutical) and Dormicum (midazolam, 3.4 mg/kg, Hoffman-La Roche). Body temperature of the rats is monitored and kept at 38° C. throughout the surgical procedure. Lumbar spinal cords are surgically exposed by partial laminectomy and treated with a few drops of Xylocain (lidocain hydrochloride, 20 mg/ml, AstraZeneca Sweden AB) on the exposed spinal cord surface prior to the spinal cord injury. Transection of the cord is performed by cutting the spinal cord with a scalpel. Through careful visual inspection, the surgeon assures that the rostral and caudal ends are completely separated, and slightly retracted. After lesioning the cord, a layer of LYOPLANT™ (B/Braun Aesculap AG) is placed on the spinal cord as dura substitution before the wound is sutured. The rats are subcutaneously injected twice with 3 ml Ringer/glucose (2.5%) before and after surgery. After surgery, the rats are given intramuscular injections of Temgesic (buprenorphin, 7 μg/kg, Reckitt & Colman) twice a day for four days. The urinary bladders are emptied manually twice daily, and Borgal (trimetoprim sulfa, 15 mg/kg s.c., Intervet International B.V.) is given if signs of urinary infection appear. A 2-3 mm long bundle of 4RepCT fibers, for example prepared as described in the previous Examples (with or without additional peptide motifs such as RGD, RGE, IKVAV and YIGSR or using another variant of a spidroin protein, e.g. NT4RepCTHis), is placed in the gap of the spinal cord, either at the time of injury or one week after injury. In the acute implantation paradigm, a bundle of 4RepCT fibers is cut to fit the gap of the cut spinal cord, and gently placed in contact with the spinal cord stumps rostral and caudal to the implant, with the 4RepCT fibers in the same axis as the spinal cord. The LYOPLANT™ dura substitution is thereafter placed over the 4RepCT implant. In case the 4RepCT fiber bundle is implanted one week post-injury, the animal is anesthetized, the wound reopened and the spinal cord exposed. After trimming the rostral and caudal stumps of the cord, the fiber bundle, cut to fit the gap, is placed in the same axis as the spinal cord to ascertain contact between the fibers and the spinal cord tissue rostral and caudal to the implant. The wound is closed as described above. Co-Implantation of Human Immature Cells In a similar experiment, implantation of 4RepCT fibers as described above is combined with engraftment of human neural stem cells and human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. The cells are derived from human routine abortions, according to procedures approved by the Regional Ethical Committee, and after written consent from the abortion-seeking woman. After in vitro culture of the appropriate cells according to proprietary procedures, a suspension of 100,000-500,000 cells in a minimal volume of DM EM-F12 without growth factors is injected into the 4RepCT fiber bundle, which is then used as described in the previous section. Behavioral Assessment To study hind-limb motor function, rats are allowed to move in an open field (150×64 cm) and observed for at least four minutes. The function of the hind-limbs, movement of joints, positioning of paws, weight bearing, coordination and toe clearance is evaluated and rated according to the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) Locomotor Rating Scale (Basso et al (1995), J Neurotrauma 12:1-21, for review see Basso (2004), J Neurotrauma 21:395-404). The tests are video recorded, and at least two independent observers blinded to the treatment evaluate each rat. Animals are evaluated preoperatively and 1, 2, 6, 12 and 18 weeks post surgery. Tracing of Neuronal Outgrowth Anterograde tracing is performed by injecting biotinylated dextrane amine (BDA, Neurotrace) at multiple sites in the parietal cortex for one week according to the manufacturer's description. Retrograde tracing is accomplished by injection of Fluoro-gold in the spinal cord 3-5 mm caudal of the lesion. BDA is visualized in the spinal cord caudal of the injury, to visualize cortico-spinal descending axons crossing the spinal lesion, while Fluoro-gold-labeled neurons are screened for in nucleus ruber of the brainstem, as evidence for regrowth of descending rubro-spinal neurons. Morphological Analysis After the last behavioral assessment at 18 weeks post-lesion, the rats are given a lethal dose of intravenous sedatives and perfused through the ascending aorta with 100 ml Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution, followed by 400 ml of phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Merck). The entire brain stem and 4-5 cm of the vertebral column including the lesion are dissected out, post-fixed for 2 hours in the same fixative and cryo-preserved in 10% sucrose at 4° C. for at least 24 h. The spinal cord is then carefully dissected out of the vertebral column, the cord and the brainstem embedded in Tissue-Tek, frozen, sectioned at 10 μm in a cryostat and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. For immunohistochemical analysis, the following primary antibodies are used: human-specific rabbit anti-heat shock protein 27, rabbit anti-nestin, rabbit anti-β-tubulin type II, mouse monoclonal human-specific anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein, rabbit anti microtubule-associated protein 2. Primary antibodies are diluted in 0.1 M phosphate buffer with 0.3% Triton X-100 (TPBS). The secondary antibodies used are conjugated to Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Lab. Inc) or Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). Sections are treated with 1.5% normal goat serum (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 minutes, incubated with primary antibodies at 4° C. over night followed by rinsing and two hour incubation with secondary antibodies at room temperature. All sections are counterstained with nuclear marker Hoechst 33342 (30 μg/ml, Molecular Probes), and mounted with poly vinyl-alcohol (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma) in DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 0.03 mg/ml, Sigma). The immunolabeled tissue sections are studied in a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiophot), for quantitative analyses, images are captured using a CCD camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-ER) and the OPENLAB™ software for Macintosh (Improvision). Example 11 Recombinant Spider Silk Protein Scaffolds for Support of the Regeneration of Axons in Organotypic Cultures This experiment will show that 4RepCT scaffolds can support and guide the regeneration of axons. Pieces of the spinal cord and brainstem are maintained in cultures ex vivo. By applying a scaffold of 4RepCT that connects two such tissue pieces, regenerating axons will be provided sufficient support to bridge the gap. The experiment will give an indication of the usefulness of 4RepCT scaffolds to support axonal outgrowth and restoration of damaged tissue in spinal cord injuries in vivo. An organotypic culture of the brain stem and the cervical region of the cord is prepared. Brains and spinal cords are collected from early pre-natal and post-natal Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Sections in the sagittal plane through the brain stem and cervical region of the spinal cord are made using a vibratome. The dissected tissue is placed on membranes (MILLICELL™-CM; Millipore, Billerica, Mass., USA), in 1 ml of serum-based medium (50% basal medium Eagle with Earle's Salts (BME; Sigma, St. Louis, Md., USA), 25% heat inactivated horse serum (Gibco, Grand Island, N.Y., USA), and 25% Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS; Sigma), 1 mM L-glutamine and 0.5% d-glucose) in a 6-well tissue culture plate in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37° C. The tissue sections are incubated for 7-14 days, the medium replaced every 3 days. At the time of injury, a transection of the upper cervical spinal cord is made with a razor blade. The tissue is inspected in an inverted microscope to ensure complete separation of the two parts of the explant. A bundle of 4RepCT fibers, prepared as described in previous Examples (with or without additional peptide motifs such as RGD, RGE, IKVAV and YIGSR or using another variant of a spidroin protein, e.g. NT4RepCTHis), is placed in the gap between the tissue pieces. The cultures are incubated for another 14 days, before being fixed by immersion in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Merck) for 2 hours and cryo-preserved in 10% sucrose at 4° C. for 24 h. For immunohistochemical analysis, the following primary antibodies are used: human-specific rabbit anti-heat shock protein 27, rabbit anti-nestin, rabbit anti-β-tubulin type II, mouse monoclonal human-specific anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein, rabbit anti microtubule-associated protein 2. Primary antibodies are diluted in 0.1 M phosphate buffer with 0.3% Triton X-100 (TPBS). The secondary antibodies used are conjugated to Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Lab. Inc) or Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). Fixed cultures are treated with 1.5% normal goat serum (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 minutes, incubated with primary antibodies at 4° C. over night followed by rinsing and two hour incubation with secondary antibodies at room temperature. All tissues are counterstained with nuclear marker Hoechst 33342 (30 μg/ml, Molecular Probes), and mounted with poly vinyl-alcohol (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma) in DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 0.03 mg/ml, Sigma). The immunolabeled tissue sections are studied in a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiophot) for quantitative analyses, images are captured using a CCD camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-ER) and the OPENLAB™ software for Macintosh (Improvision). The results are predicted to indicate that 4RepCT scaffolds can guide regeneration of injured axons. Example 12 Human Embryonic Stem Cells on Recombinant Spider Silk The experiment explores further the feasibility of culturing human embryonic stem cells on a recombinant spider silk material, building on the study reported as Example 2 above. Materials and Methods Standard six-well tissue culture plates were prepared. In the plates, three wells contained film of one of the following 4RepCT variants: RGD-4RepCT, RGE-4RepCT, IKVAV-4RepCT, YIGSR-4RepCT and NT4RepCTHis, while the remaining three wells of each plate were empty. All films of 4RepCT with peptide motifs and of NT4RepCTHis were prepared essentially as described in Example 1. In total, 15 plates were included in the experiment (representing triplicates of each 4RepCT variant). The plates were kept dry at room temperature until further use. In preparation for the experiment, the tissue culture plates were UV irradiated for 30 minutes in a Class II microbiological safety cabinet. The three empty wells in each plate were then coated with CELLstart™ CTS™ (Invitrogen; cat no A10142-01), as per manufacturer's protocol. Human embryonic stem cells (RCM-1, De Sousa et al, Stem Cell Res 2:188-197; Roslin Cells, Edinburgh, UK) were cultured on CELLstart™ with the serum and feeder free medium STEMPRO® hESC SFM—Human Embryonic Stem Cell Culture Medium (Invitrogen; cat no A1000701), as per manufacturer's protocol. The cells were passaged at a ratio of 1:6 from a 90% confluent well using STEMPRO® EZPassage™—Disposable Stem Cell Passaging Tool (Invitrogen; cat no 23181-010) as per manufacturer's protocol. Wells were washed with PBS, and medium was placed in all wells and preincubated prior to cell seeding. Cells at passage 60 were seeded into all wells of five six-well plates (representing the five different variants) at the recommended density, and care was taken not to disturb cells after seeding. All wells were cultured with STEMPRO® hESC SFM as per manufacturer's protocol. Incubation was performed in a standard culture incubator at 37° C., 5% CO2 in air, at 95% humidity. Cells were observed daily and 100% medium exchanged every 48 hours. All medium was pre-equilibrated to incubator conditions for two hours prior to exchange feeding. Cells were passaged after 16 days, and again after 6 more days, onto the remaining two six well plates of the respective variants. The passaging regime for these two time points involved a method established by Roslin Cellabs for the single cell dissociation of human embryonic stem cells. Single cell dissociation was achieved using TrypLE Select (Invitrogen cat. no. A12177 (100 ml 10×)) as per manufacturer's instructions with a pre-treatment for 1 h using a ROCK inhibitor (ROCK inhibitor/Y27632; FluoroChem cat. no. 047265) as per the manufacturer's instructions (Watanabe et al (2007),Nat Biotechnol 25, 681-686). This has been shown to be essential for the successful growth of embryonic stem cells post enzymatic passaging. Control and trial cells were treated identically and all were subsequently seeded at equivalence. After 24 h of the third passage of the study, wells were stained with Sigma-Aldrich: alkaline phosphatase (AP), Leukocyte (Sigma-Aldrich; Ref 86R-1 KT, Lot 019K4349) as per manufacturer's protocol. Results Selected images from the cell culture experiments are presented as FIGS. 48-52. No differences between the various 4RepCT variants were observed. Initially, cells were non-adherent “clumps” with a small degree of adherence. Growth was much slower than that seen in the control wells, which could be a consequence of the cell line adapting to the 4RepCT variants, as seen in Example 2. It is often the case that embryonic stem cell lines will go through a phase of transition or lag, prior to establishing again on a new matrix or indeed in a new medium composition. These Embryonic Body (EB) structures did eventually adhere to the matrix, and from these EB masses, cells were seen to grow and expand, which suggests adaptation to the new matrix as illustrated by photographs of cells in the first, second and third passage of the experiment (FIGS. 48-52). Subsequent passaging resulted in improved morphology and growth. As shown by alkaline phosphatase staining, the cells are, surprisingly, still exhibiting undifferentiated stem cell characteristics after 23 days of culture on the respective 4RepCT variants (FIGS. 50-52). Conclusions All control wells showed the characteristics and morphology as would be expected with this hESC line under the control culture conditions employed. The cell line showed signs of adaptation to all the 4RepCT variants. Initial adherence, growth and culture morphology was poor in the first passage on 4RepCT variants. However, subsequent growth and passaging resulted in colonies exhibiting the morphology characteristic of an undifferentiated cell, with positive alkaline phosphatase staining for all variants. This study of hESC culture on 4RepCT variants surprisingly indicates that the variants allow culturing of hESCs and that they are suitable for maintaining the cells' stemness, for example with respect to morphology, growth characteristics and Alkaline Phosphatase staining. 1.
