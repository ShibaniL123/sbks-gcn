Container, Indicator Device, and Nebulizer The present invention relates to a container according to the preamble of claim 1 , to an indicator device according to the preamble of claim 5, and to a nebulizer according to the preamble of claim 20. WO 2012/162305 A1 discloses a nebulizer. A container can be inserted into a housing of the nebulizer. The housing is closed by a lower housing part. By rotating the housing part the drive spring can be put under tension and fluid can be sucked into a compression chamber of the pressure generator. Simultaneously, the container is moved into the lower housing part in a stroke movement within the nebulizer and when tensioned for the first time the container may be pierced through its base by a piercing element in the lower housing part to allow venting of the container. After manual pressing a button, the drive spring is released and moves the delivery tube into the pressure chamber so that the fluid is put under pressure by the drive spring and is delivered or atomized through a nozzle into a mouthpiece as an aerosol, without the use of propellant gas. Thus, the container is moving axially forth and back during conveying of the fluid to be nebulized, and during pressure generation and nebulization. The container may be connected inseparably with the housing part by a securing device forming a transportation lock for holding the container unmovable in a delivery state. The nebulizer comprises an indicator device for counting and/or indicating a number of uses performed or still possible. The indicator device blocks further use in a locked state when a predetermined number of uses has been reached or exceeded with the current container. Then, the container can be replaced together with a housing part and the nebulizer can be used further with the new container. US 7,823,584 B2 discloses a similar nebulizer, wherein a counter device can be integrated into a housing part that is exchangeable or replaceable together with the container, which is inseparable from the housing part. WO 2007/104694 A1 discloses an inhaler for powdery substances with an indicator device which may comprise a worm gear for driving an indicator element. Object of the present invention is to provide a container, an indicator device and a nebulizer allowing easy and/or secure operation and handling and/or a compact and/or reliable construction, preferably while allowing replacement of the container without replacement of any housing part of the nebulizer. The above object is achieved by a container according to claim 1 , by an indicator device according to claim 5 or by a nebulizer container according to claim 20. Preferred embodiments are subject of the subclaims. The present invention relates to a nebulizer for nebulizing a fluid, preferably liquid medicament, from a preferably replaceable container containing the fluid, and relates to the container and an indicator device itself. Preferably, the indicator device is provided for counting and/or indicating the number of uses already performed or still possible with the container. According one aspect to the present invention, the indicator device comprises preferably a piercing element for opening an aeration, preferably an aeration opening. In particular, this allows a very compact construction and/or supports secure operation. Preferably, the piercing part is arranged within the indicator device or its housing, at least when the piercing part is not actuated or before first actuation. Preferably, the piercing part is held in a non-piercing position or within the hous- ing of the indicator device before first actuation. This ensures secure operation and prevents undesired aeration of the container, e.g. during transport or before use. Preferably, the piercing part is held in a non-piercing or initial position or within the housing of the indicator device by means of one or more flexible arms, in particular of an associated support structure or the like. Alternatively or additionally, the piecing part can be held in the non-piercing or initial position by form-fit, snap-fit or force-fit or the like. This allows a very compact or simple construction and/or secure operation. Preferably, the piercing part is moveable axially. This allows a very compact and/or simple construction. Preferably, the piercing part is locked or held in a piercing position after first use. This allows a simple or secure operation and handling, in particular easy actuation of the nebulizer during further use. The piercing part and/or its tip can comprise at least one channel, groove, passage or the like for ensuring aeration, in particular even when the piercing part is held or kept in the opening or piercing position in order to ensure the desired aeration of the respective container. Preferably, the piercing part allows axial compensation of tolerances when actuated by a driving part which may be axially moveable relative to the indicator device, in particular during tensioning of the nebulizer, pumping fluid or dispensing fluid. According to another aspect of the present invention, the nebulizer comprises a driving part for driving or actuating or triggering the indicator device and for opening or piercing the container, in particular by movement of the container or indicator device relative to a nebulizer housing or driving part. This allows a very compact and reliable construction and/or a minimization of required parts and/or supports secure operation. In particular, the indicator device or an associated locking device can lock the container and/or nebulizer or can cause the locking of the container and/or nebulizer against further use in a locked state when a predetermined number of uses has been reached or exceeded with the respective container. Preferably the nebulizer and/or container cannot be used anymore in the locked state when the indicator device has detected that a predetermined number of uses has been reached or exceeded, in particular with the respective container. The indicator device may either directly or indirectly lock or initiate or trigger locking of the nebulizer and/or container against further use. In particular, the indicator device may directly actuate the locking device or indirectly initiate actuation of the locking device. It is also possible that the nebulizer is not immediately blocked against further use when the indicator device enters the locked state. Instead, the indicator device may initiate or cause or trigger in its locked state that the locking device is going to block the nebulizer against further use, e.g. during the next actuation or tensioning or the like. Thus, the locking device may enter its locking state later, e.g. after at least partial opening of the nebulizer and/or at least partial tensioning of the nebulizer or rotation of the housing part or inner part of the nebulizer or the like. Therefore, the blocking of the nebulizer can be initiated or caused by the indicator device not only indirectly, but alternatively or additionally also later during further handling, operation, actuation or the like. In the latter case, the indicator de- vice blocks or initiates or causes blocking of the nebulizer and/or container against further use also preferably in the sense of the present invention. Preferably, the locking of the nebulizer against further use can be overcome by replacing the container, in particular including the indicator device, against one not yet used. Preferably the indicator device is inseparably connected with the container or with a container housing of the container, but separable from the nebulizer or its housing and from the housing part, so that the indicator device is replaceable together with the container. This allows reuse of the nebulizer and the housing part with another container including another indicator device. Thus the overall size of the components to be exchanged is kept small, so that the replacement packages are size reduced, so that transport of a large number of packages is facilitated. Further, this results in the advantage that the piercing part of the re- spective indicator device has to open the aeration or pierce the associated container only once as the indicator device is replaced together with the container so that a new piercing part is provided for the new container as well. Preferably, the indicator device is in particular fixedly arranged adjacent to the aeration opening or a venting hole or to an associated foil or closure, in particular at a bottom of the container and/or opposite to an outlet of the container. This allows a very compact construction. Further, the indicator device does not interfere with the fluidic connection of the container to the nebulizer or vice versa. According to a further aspect of the present invention, the indicator device comprises preferably a protection or closure, in particular for closing an insertion opening for the driving part. In particular, the protection and/or closure can be opened automatically, in particular by means of the driving part. This allows easy handling and/or secure operation. In particular, the protection or closure may protect the indicator device against dust or the like. Preferably, the piercing part forms or holds the closure and/or closes the insertion opening, in particular before first use or insertion of the container and indicator device into the nebulizer. The indicator device may be provided with the protection in addition to the closure. In this case, the protection may be removed manually before inserting the container with the indicator device in the nebulizer. The closure is preferably opened automatically during first use or during (completely) closing the nebulizer. This allows a very easy, secure and/or intuitive handling and operation. Preferably, the indicator device comprises an indicator element and an actuation element for indexing the indicator element. In particular, the indicator element displays an indication of the number of uses already performed or still possible with the respective container. The above aspects of the present invention and the further aspects described below can be realized independently from each other, and in any combination.

In the Figures, the same reference numerals are used for identical or similar parts, resulting preferably in corresponding or comparable properties and advantages, even if the associated description is not repeated. Figs. 1 and 2 show a known nebulizer 1 for atomizing a fluid 2, particularly a highly effective pharmaceutical composition, medicament or the like, diagram- matically shown in a non-tensioned state (Fig. 1 ) and in a tensioned state (Fig. 2). The nebulizer 1 is constructed in particular as a portable inhaler and preferably operates only mechanical and/or without propellant gas. When the fluid 2, preferably a liquid, more particularly a pharmaceutical composition, is nebulized , an aerosol 14 (Fig. 1 ) is formed or dispensed, which can be breathed in or inhaled by a user. Usually the inhaling is done at least once a day, more particularly several times a day, preferably at set intervals, depending on the complaint or illness from which a patient is suffering. The nebulizer 1 is provided with or comprises an insertable or replaceable container 3 containing the fluid 2. The container 3 thus forms a reservoir for the fluid 2, which is to be nebulized. Preferably, the container 3 contains multiple doses of fluid 2 or active substance in particular sufficient to provide up to 200 dosage units or doses, for example, i.e. to allow up to 200 sprays or applications. A typical container 3, as disclosed in WO 96/0601 1 A1 , holds e.g. a volume of about 2 to 20 ml. Further, the number of doses contained in the container 3 and/or the total volume of the fluid 2 contained in the container 3 can vary depending on the fluid 2 or respective medicament and/or depending on the container 3 and/or depending on the necessary medication or the like. Preferably, the container 3 can be replaced or exchanged, wherein the total number of uses of the nebulizer 1 and thus the number of containers 3, which can be used with the same nebulizer 1 , is preferably restricted, e.g. to a total number of four or five containers 3. WO 2012/162305 A1 discloses additionally such a restriction to the total numbers of containers 3 which can be used with the same nebulizer 1 . The container 3 is preferably substantially cylindrical or cartridge-shaped and once the nebulizer 1 has been opened the container 3 can be inserted therein preferably from below and changed if desired. It is preferably of rigid construc- tion, the fluid 2 in particular being held in a collapsible bag 4 in the container 3. In particular, the container 3 comprises a venting opening or hole 23 which is opened before or during first use. The nebulizer 1 comprises a delivery mechanism, preferably a pressure genera- tor 5, for conveying and nebulizing the fluid 2, particularly in a preset and optionally in an adjustable dosage amount. The nebulizer 1 or pressure generator 5 comprises preferably a holder 6 for re- leasably holding the container 3, a drive spring 7 associated to the holder 6, only partly shown, and/or a blocking element 8 preferably in form of or with a button for preferably manual actuation or depressing. The blocking element 8 can catch and block the holder 6 and can be manually operated to release the holder 6 allowing drive spring 7 to expand. The nebulizer 1 or pressure generator 5 comprises preferably a conveying element, such as a conveying tube 9, a non-return valve 10, a pressure chamber 1 1 and/or an nozzle 12 for nebulizing the fluid 2 into a mouthpiece 13. The completely inserted container 3 is fixed or held in the nebulizer 1 via the holder 6 such that the conveying element fluidically connects the container 3 to the nebulizer 1 or pressure generator 5. Preferably, the conveying tube 9 penetrates into the container 3. The nebulizer 1 or holder 6 is preferably constructed so that the container 3 can be exchanged. When the drive spring 7 is axially tensioned in the tensioning process, the holder 6 with the container 3 and the conveying tube 9 are moved downwards in the drawings and fluid 2 is sucked out of the container 3 into the pressure chamber 1 1 of the pressure generator 5 through the non-return valve 10. In this state, the holder 6 is caught by the blocking element 8 so that the drive spring 7 is kept compressed. Then, the nebulizer 1 is in the tensioned state. During the subsequent relaxation in the nebulization process after actuation or pressing of the blocking element 8 the fluid 2 in the pressure chamber 1 1 is put under pressure as the conveying tube 9 with its now closed non-return valve 10 is moved back in the pressure chamber 1 1 , here in the drawings upwards, by the relaxation or force of the drive spring 7 and now acts as a pressing ram or piston. This pressure forces the fluid 2 through the nozzle 12, whereupon it is nebulized into the aerosol 14, as shown in Fig. 1 , and, thus, dispensed. Generally, the nebulizer 1 operates with a spring pressure of 5 to 200 MPa, preferably 10 to 100 MPa on the fluid 2, and/or with a volume of fluid 2 delivered per stroke of 10 to 50 μΙ, preferably 1 0 to 20 μΙ, most preferably about 15 μΙ. The fluid 2 is converted into or nebulized as aerosol 14, the droplets of which have an aerodynamic diameter of up to 20 μητι, preferably 3 to 10 pm. Preferably, the generated jet spray has an angle of 20° to 160°, preferably 80° to 100°. These values also apply to the nebulizer 1 according to the teaching of the present invention as particularly preferred values. A user or patient (not shown) can inhale the aerosol 14, preferably while an air supply can be sucked into the mouthpiece 1 3 through at least one optional air supply opening 15. The nebulizer 1 comprises preferably a housing 24 and/or (upper) housing part 16 and optionally a biasing or inner part 17 preferably which is rotatable relative thereto (Fig. 2) and/or has an upper part 17a and a lower part 17b (Fig. 1 ). The nebulizer 1 or housing 24 comprises preferably a (lower) housing part 18. This part 18 is in particular manually operable, and/or releasable fixed, particularly fitted or held onto the inner part 17, preferably by means of a retaining element 19. Preferably, the housing parts 16 and 18 and/or other parts form the housing 24 of the nebulizer 1 . In order to insert and/or replace the container 3, preferably the housing 24 can be opened and/or the housing part 18 can be detached from the nebulizer 1 , inner part 17 or housing 24. Generally and preferably, the container 3 can be inserted before the housing 24 is closed and/or before the housing part 18 is connected to the housing 24. The container 3 may be inserted, opened and/or fluidically connected to the delivery mechanism automatically or simultaneously when (completely) connecting the housing part 18 to the housing 24 / nebulizer 1 and/or when (completely) closing the housing 24 / nebulizer 1 . Preferably, the container 3 is open or fluidically connected when tensioning the nebulizer 1 for the first time with the current container 3. Preferably, the nebulizer 1 or drive spring 7 can be manually activated or ten- sioned or loaded, in particular by actuation of an actuation member, here preferably by rotating housing part 18 or any other component. The actuation member, preferably the housing part 18, can be actuated, here ro- tated relative to the upper housing part 16, carrying with it or driving the inner part 17. The inner part 17 acts on a gear or transmission to transform the rotation in an axial movement. As a result the drive spring 7 is tensioned in the axial direction by means of the gear or transmission (not shown) formed between the inner part 17, in particular its upper part 17a, and the holder 6 and acting on the holder 6. During tensioning the container 3 is moved axially downwards until the container 3 assumes an end position as shown in Fig. 2. In this activated or ten- sioned state the drive spring 7 is under tension and can be caught or held by the blocking element 8. During the nebulizing process the container 3 is moved back into its original position (non-tensioned position or state shown in Fig. 1 ) by (the force of) the drive spring 7. Thus the container 3 executes a lifting or stroke movement during the tensioning process and during the nebulizing process. The housing part 1 8 preferably forms a cap-like lower housing part and/or fits around or over a lower free end portion of the container 3. As the drive spring 7 is tensioned the container 3 moves with its end portion (further) into the housing part 18 or towards the end face thereof, while an aeration means, such as an axially acting spring 20 arranged in the housing part 18, comes in contact with base 21 of the container 3 and pierces the container 3 or a base seal or foil 50 thereon with a piercing element 22 when the container 3 makes contact with it for the first time, to allow air in or aeration, preferably by opening or piercing venting hole 23. The venting hole 23 allows for pressure compensation inside the container 3 when fluid 2 is drawn from the container 3 during the actuation of the nebulizer 1 . The nebulizer 1 comprises preferably an indicator device 25, which counts in particular actuations of the nebulizer 1 , preferably by detecting its tensioning or the rotation of the inner part 17 relative to the upper part 16 or housing 24. Pref- erably, the counter device 25 or an associated locking device 26 locks the nebulizer 1 against (further) actuation or use, e.g. blocks further rotation of the housing part 18 / inner part 17 and, thus, tensioning of the nebulizer 1 or its drive spring 7 and/or blocks actuation of the blocking element 8, in a locked state when a certain number of actuations or operations or discharged doses has been reached or exceeded. In the following and with reference to the further figures, a preferred embodiment of the nebulizer 1 , container 3, indicator device 25 and/or locking device 26 is described and shown according to the invention, wherein primarily important as- pects and differences will be described and the previous aspects, features and explanations apply preferably additionally or correspondingly even without repetition. Fig. 3 shows the nebulizer 1 with the container 3 and indicator device 25 according the present invention in a schematic section (longitudinal section) in the non- tensioned state with completely closed nebulizer housing 24 and, thus, closed housing part 18, wherein the container 3 including the proposed indicator device 25 are inserted into or received within the nebulizer 1 and/or housing 24. Fig. 4 shows an enlarged partial section of the encircled part of Fig. 3. Fig. 5 shows a perspective view of the section of the nebulizer 1 of Fig. 3. Fig. 6 shows a partial enlargement of the encircled part of Fig. 5. The nebulizer 1 has preferably a longitudinal form or axis which corresponds to the axial direction and/or to the main dispensing direction and/or to stroke movement of the container 3 during tensioning and dispensing. In the shown non-tensioned state, the nebulizer 1 or its mouthpiece 13 is preferably closed by a mouthpiece cover 27. The mouthpiece cover 27 is preferably pivotable to allow opening of the mouthpiece 13 for using the nebulizer 1 . Preferably, the indicator device 25 is directly and/or unreleasably secured or fixed to or connected with the container 3. In particular, the indicator device 25 is associated to a respective container 3. If the container 3 of the nebulizer 1 is replaced, the indicator device 25 is necessarily or positively replaced as well. Preferably, the indicator device 25 is fixedly arranged at the bottom or container base 21 of the container 3 and/or opposite to an outlet or head 28 of the container 3. In the present embodiment, the indicator device 25 is preferably directly connected to or abuts at an outer case or preferably rigid housing 29 of the contain- er 3. Preferably, the indicator device 25 and the container 3 are connected by form-fit and/or snap-fit. In particular, the indicator device 25 circumvents and/or grips over a (lower or bottom) edge 30 and/or any other protrusion or the like of the container 3. In the present embodiment, the edge 30 is a little bit wider in diameter so that it pro- trudes radially over the essentially cylindrical outer form of the side wall of the container 3 / container housing 29. The diameter of the indicator device 25 is preferably at least essentially equal to or slightly greater than the diameter of the container 3 or its edge 30. The edge 30 is preferably formed between the side wall and the bottom or base 21 of the container 3 or container housing 29. Preferably, the edge 30 is formed by flanging, bordering, bending or crimping or by any other suitable material- deforming process. The indicator device 25 comprises a housing 31 and/or preferably has an at least essentially cylindrical form. The indicator device 25 or its housing 31 is preferably attached to the container 3 or its base 21 or housing 29 with an at least essentially flat and/or axial side. The indicator device 25 or its housing 31 comprises preferably a holding or gripping section 32 for connecting the indicator device 25 with the container 3. Pref- erably, the gripping section 32 circumvents the edge 30 and/or grips around or over the edge 30. In the present embodiments, the gripping section 32 is preferably annular and/or grips over the edge 31 at positions distributed over the circumference of the edge 30 or container 3. Preferably, the indicator device 25 and the container 3 are connected with each other by a snap-fit or click connection. Preferably, the container 3 and the indicator device 25 are connected with each other by axially snapping one part on the other. Preferably, the gripping section 32 is sufficiently elastic in radial direction so that the container 3 can be entered axially with its edge 30. In the present embodiment, the gripping section 32 preferably comprises a respectively inclined inser- tion face to facilitate insertion of edge 30 into the annular gripping section 32 or between circumferentially distributed gripping sections 32. It has to be noted that other constructional solutions are possible for connecting the container 3 or its housing 29 with the indicator device 25 or its housing 31 or vice versa. In particular, the two parts can be connected with each other additionally or alternatively by welding, brazing, gluing, screwing, clamping, hot- pressing, or the like. Fig. 7 shows in a schematic, exploded view the indicator device 25 according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The indicator or its housing 31 comprises preferably an upper part 33 and a lower part 34. Preferably, the upper part 33 holds or forms the gripping section 32. The indicator device 25 comprises preferably an indicator element 35 and an associated actuation element 36 and/or a transmission 40 or gear 41 for indexing the indicator element 35 or for causing the indexing of the indicator element 35. The indicator device 25 is for counting and/or indicating a number of uses performed or still possible with the respective or associated container 3. Preferably, the indicator element 35 comprises markings 37, such as one or more symbols, numbers, coloured or shaded areas or the like, for at least roughly indicating the number of uses already performed with or still possible with the respective con- tainer 3. In the present embodiment, the indicator element 35 is preferably rotat- able and/or comprises a circumferential wall or outer surface with the at least one marking 37. The indicator housing 31 comprises preferably a window 31 a, in particular in the circumferential wall through the relevant marking 37 is visible for a user or patient, preferably through the housing part 18 which is in particular transparent. The actuation element 36 comprises preferably an actuation arm 38 which, intern comprises preferably a free or actuation end 39, for direct or indirect actua- tion or indexing of the indicator element 35. Indexing means that the indicator element 35 is moved forward in increments or steps. Preferred is an indirect actuation or driving so that the actuation element 36 or its arm 38 actuates or drives the indicator element 35 via a transmission 40. In the present embodiment, the transmission 40 results in a reduction and/or is realized as a worm device. The indicator device 25 or transmission 40 comprises preferably a gear 41 and/or a worm 42. Most preferably, the worm 42 is directly formed by the gear 41 so that the gear 41 forms a worm gear and preferably comprises radially protruding teeth 43 in which at least one convolution of the worm 42 is formed (compare the horizontal or axial sections of the mounted indicator device 25 shown in Figs. 8 and 9). The gear 41 comprises preferably an axle, in particular one or more axle sections 44 which may axially protrude on opposite sides as realized in the present embodiment. The actuation element 36 causes a rotation of the gear 41 around an axis preferably perpendicular to the direction of movement of the actuation element 36, the axis preferably being arranged in a horizontal plane identical or parallel to the plane given by the movement of the actuation element 36. The gear 41 is rotatably held preferably by the housing 31 or lower housing part 34, preferably by two bearing sections 45 of the lower part 34. Preferably, the bearing sections 45 comprises recesses for rotatably holding the axle sections 44. However, other constructional solutions are possible as well. The housing 31 or lower part 34 bears preferably the indicator element 35 such that it can rotate. In the present embodiment, the lower part 34 comprises preferably two bearing portions 46 arranged on opposite radial sides and axially pro- truding for rotatably bearing the indicator element 35. The actuation element 35 and/or transmission 40 are preferably arranged at least essentially in between the bearing portions 46. The indicator device 25 comprises preferably an actuation spring 47, in particu- lar for biasing the actuation element 36 into a preferred direction and/or for driving the indicator element 35 Fig. 8 shows in a horizontal or axial section the mounted indicator device 25 in an actuated state where the actuation element 36 has been moved or pushed sidewards, namely starting from the first position shown in Figs. 3 to 6 towards the left into a second position which is shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 9 shows in a similar section as Fig. 8 the indicator device 25 in a locked state where the actuation element 36 is in a locked, third position. It can been seen from Figs. 8 and 9 that protrusions 60 of the indicator element 35 (not shown in Figs. 8 and 9) extend axially, wherein always at least one protrusion 60 is caught in the worm 42 so that a worm drive is formed between the gear 41 and the indicator element 35. Thus, any rotation of gear 41 is transformed in a reduced rotation of the indicator element 35. Further, a permanent engagement between the gear 41 and the indicator element 35, more precisely between at least one protrusion 60 and the worm 42, is ensured. However, other constructional solutions or couplings between the gear 41 and the indicator element 35 are possible. Fig. 10 shows the mounted indicator device 25 in a perspective section in the ini- tial, first position and state. Fig. 1 1 shows the indicator device 25 in a similar perspective section, but with released actuation element 36, i.e. just before the locked state is reached. Preferably, the transmission 40 or gear 41 forms a worm (helical groove) 42 with at least one convolution, preferably a with about 1 .5 or more convolutions, so that always at least one engaging element of the indicator element 35 or of any other transmission component, in particular the inwardly or axially projecting protrusion 60, engages in the worm 42. Thus, rotation of the gear 41 around its preferably transversal axis results in a rotation of the indicator element 35 around its preferably longitudinally oriented rotation axis. However, other constructional solutions are possible as well. Preferably, the teeth 43 are relatively long and/or extend radially sufficiently so that the protrusions are securely guided within the convolutions of the worm 42, in between the teeth 43, and that the actuation portion 39 can still move in radial direction between the protrusion 60 engaging into the worm 42 and the gear 41 in order to actuate or rotate the gear 41 in the desired manner. For this purpose, the actuation portion 39 may engage into respectively deep cut outs between the teeth 43 in order to be able to move below the respective projection 60. The indicator device 25 comprises preferably a piercing part 48 (compare Fig. 3 to 6). The piercing part 48 is arranged within the indicator device 25 or its housing 31 . The piercing part 48 is preferably axially moveable. The piercing part 48 is preferably moveable such that it can protrude towards the container 3 and/or can open an aeration opening, preferably the venting hole 23, of the container 3, in particular by breaking or piercing a foil 50 covering the venting hole 23. In the present embodiment, the piecing element 48 comprises preferably an opening end or tip 49 which can open or pierce the foil 50 covering the container base 21 , in particular an indention 51 formed in the container 3 or its base 21. Preferably, the indention 51 comprises a break through which forms the venting hole 23. However, other constructional solutions are possible as well. Fig. 12 shows in a partial enlargement similar to Fig. 4 a lower portion of the nebulizer 1 in an intermediate state after partial tensioning. The indicator device 25 is in an actuated state as shown in Fig. 8 (second position). The nebulizer 1 or housing part 18 comprises preferably a driving part 52 for driving or actuating the indicator device 25 when using the nebulizer 1 , in particular for actuating the indicator device 25 in response to any tensioning of the nebulizer 1 and/or any (axial or stroke-like) movement of the container 3. Preferably, the driving part 52 is arranged or formed in the housing part 18, in particular on the axial end face or bottom 53 of the housing part 18. Preferably, the driving part 52 is arranged centrally and/or extends axially. Preferably, the driving part 52 is at least substantially cylindrical and/or pin-like or bolt-like. Preferably, the driving part 52 is held by the housing part 18 and/or integrally formed by the housing part 8. In the preferred embodiment, the movement of the container 3 and, thus, of the indicator device 25 during the tensioning (downward movement in the drawings) and/or during pressurization and dispensing (upward movement in the drawings) and/or one or both of the respective end positions in the non-tensioned state and tensioned state, respectively, can be used for actuating the indicator device 25, i.e. for counting. Preferably, the relative movement of the container 3 and/or indicator device 25 within the nebulizer 1 , and more preferred the movement during dispensing, is used for actuating or triggering the indicator device 25 and/or counting. When tensioning the nebulizer 1 and/or moving the indicator device 25 downwards, the driving part 25 enters or engages through an insertion opening 54 of the indicator device 25 or its housing 31 , in particular axially. Preferably, the driving part 52 and the insertion opening 54 are arranged central- ly and/or axially aligned. In the present embodiment, the driving part 52 actuates the actuation element 36, i.e. moves the actuation element 36 from an initial first position shown in Fig. 3 to 6, to an actuated second position shown in Fig. 9. Preferably, the actuation spring 47 biases the actuation element 36 into the first position. In the present embodiment, the actuation element 36 is moveable back and forth between the first and second positions for indexing the indicator element 35, in particular for incrementally rotating the gear 41 in one direction to respectively drive the indicator element 35. As any rotation of gear 41 is transformed in a reduced rotation of the indicator element 35, thus every movement of the actuation element 36 from the first to the second position or vice versa results in a move- ment of the indicator element 35. In the present embodiment, the actuation element 36 is moveable transversally, preferably perpendicularly, to the longitudinal or dispensing direction of the con- tainer 3 or nebulizer 1 and/or to the stroke movement of the container 3 and/or indicator device 25. Preferably, the actuation element 36 is moved from the more central first posi- 5 tion radially outwards to the second position, in particular against the force of the associated, preferably helical actuation spring 47 biasing the actuation element 36 in opposite direction. In the second position, the actuation element 36 has been moved with its actua- i o tion arm 38 or actuation portion 39 out of engagement with gear 41 as indicated in Figs. 8 and 12. Fig. 1 3 shows in a similar enlarged section as Fig. 12 the fully tensioned state. 15 In the (fully) tensioned state, the container 3, more precisely the aeration opening or venting hole 23, is opened at least when the nebulizer 1 is tensioned with a container 3 for the first time. Preferably, the opening of the container 3 or venting hole 23 for aeration is real- 20 ized by piercing or breaking, in particular of foil 50. The opening or piercing can be effected directly by the driving part 52. Alternatively, the opening or piercing can be effected independently from the driving part 52, e.g. by means of the aeration spring 20 with the piercing element 22 25 similar to the embodiment shown in Fig. 2. Alternatively, as in the present embodiment, the opening or piercing can be achieved indirectly, preferably via the piercing part 48 which is preferably actuated by the driving part 52. Preferably, the piercing part 48 is formed as separate part and/or provided by 30 the indicator device 25 and/or arranged within the indicator device 25. In the preferred embodiment, the piercing part 48 is held axially moveable by a support structure 55 of the indicator device 25, housing 31 , upper part 32 and/or indicator element 35, as schematically indicated in Figs. 10 and 1 1 . 35 Preferably, the piercing part 48 and/or the support structure 55 are a one-piece- construction with a further part of the indicator devices 25, e.g. with the indicator element 35 or with the indicator housing 31 , especially with the upper part 33 of the indicator housing 31 . Preferably, the piercing part 48, support structure 55 and the further part of the indicator device 25 are made of plastic in an injection molding process. Preferably, the support structure 55 comprises one or more flexible arms or ribs for holding the piercing part 48 axially moveable and/or in the initial or non- opening position. Alternatively the piercing part 48 can be constructed as separate, axially moveable part, which is optionally spring biased in the longitudinal or axial direction preferably away from the container 3, so that the piercing tip 49 is retracted from the container 3 in the non-tensioned state. It has to be noted that the piercing part 48 or its tip 49 is preferably received within the indicator device 25 or its housing 31 , but can protrude outwards in the actuated state. The opening or piercing can be repeated each time the nebulizer 1 is tensioned, i.e. each time when the container 3 reaches its end position in the tensioned state. The piercing part 48 may be biased into its retracted or initial position shown in Fig. 3 to 6, in particular by a preferably integrally formed biasing arm, spring or the like, preferably by the support structure 55. The indicator device 25 or piercing part 48 may comprise optionally a compensation portion or device, such as a flexible arm 56, here multiple arms 56, for compensating any tolerances in axial direction. Such tolerances can occur in particular due to variations during production, in particular variations of the length of the container 3 and/or other components, variations of the connections of the container 3 with the indicator device 25, variations of the length of the indicator device 25 or its housing 31 , variations of the axial position of the contain- er 3 within the holder 6, and the like. Thus, different distances between the free end of driving part 52 and the counter-face of the piercing part 48 can result. The construction is such that the driving part 52 and the piercing part 48 cooperate in any case such that the desired piercing is ensured. The compensation portion or device allows in particular axial compression - here by radial flexing of arms 56 - when a predetermined axial force is exceeded in order to avoid any damage of the container 3 and/or any other component of the nebulizer 1 . Thus, in the preferred embodiment the driving part 52 first moves the piercing part 48 towards the container base 21 into the piercing position and further axial movement of the driving part 52 is compensated by the compensation portion, preferably by the flexible arms 56 being spread radially outwards, giving way to the tip of the driving part 52 for entering a central recess in the piercing part 48 (on the side opposite to the piercing tip 49). The piercing part 48 comprises preferably at least one axial channel, in particular one or more axially extending grooves 57 circumferentially distributed around the circumference of tip 49, in order to ensure unblocked aeration or venting even if the piercing part 48 stucks or stays in the foil 50 or piercing position. Fig. 14 shows in a similar enlargement as Fig. 4, 12 and 13 an intermediate state of the pressurization or dispensing process, i.e. when the container 3 has been moved partially upwards again. In this state, the driving part 52 has been withdrawn from the indicator device 25 or through the insertion opening 54 partially such that the actuation element 36 starts to return to its initial or first position due to the force of the actuation spring 47. Finally, after sufficient withdrawal of the driving part 52, the actuation element 36 returns into the first position shown in Figs. 3 to 6 when the back movement is completed. The back movement of the container 3 and/or of the actuation element 36 actuates preferably the indicator device 25 or gear 41 and/or is detected or counted. In particular, the actuation element 36 or its arm 38 or actuation portion 39 transmits the back movement or movement from the second to the first position to the transmission 40. In particular, this movement causes an incremental rotation of gear 41 . Thus, in the present embodiment, the movement of the container 3 and/or indicator device 25 within the nebulizer 1 during dispensing is preferably used for actuating or triggering the indicator device 25 and/or for counting. In the present embodiment, the actuation arm 38 or its portion 39 abuts against one tooth 43 of gear 41 during the back movement and, thus, turns the gear 41 due to the back movement one step further, in the drawings in clockwise direction. Preferably, the indicator device 25 comprises a ratchet 58 preventing any coun- 5 ter-rotation of the transmission 40 or gear 41 . Into the present embodiment, the ratchet 58 is formed by a flexible arm extending from the housing 31 , in particular lower housing part 34, and/or meshing with or engaging into the gear 41 or its teeth 43. i o In the end position, i.e. in the non-tensioned state, the driving part 52 is preferably further or completely retracted from the indicator device 25, the indicator housing 31 and/or insertion opening 54 as shown in Fig. 3 to 6. The transmission 40 or gear 41 transforms the actuation, in particular the (back- 15 ward) movement of the actuation element 36 or its arm 38 / actuating portion 39, into an indexing of the indicator element 35. The transmission ratio or transmission function of the transmission 40 or gear 41 may be designed or constructed such that a reduction or non-linear driving or indexing is achieved. In the present embodiment, the transmission 40 or gear 41 forms preferably a worm drive for 20 achieving a desired reduction. The movement of the actuation element 36 - in particular from the first position to the second position - results in that the actuation arm 38 or its actuation portion 39 are moved out of engagement with the gear 41 , in particular can be 25 pulled over the next tooth 43. Hereby, the arm 38 is flexed out. The subsequent movement in opposite direction, i.e. the back movement or movement from the second to the first position, results in that the actuation arm 38 or its actuation portion 39 contacts the next tooth 41 and can transmit the at least essential linear movement of the arm 38, more precisely the preferably linear movement of 30 the actuation element 36, into a rotation of the gear 41 , more precisely in an indexing of gear 41 by preferably one tooth 43. Preferably, the teeth 43 are asymmetrical, i.e. comprise differently inclined shoulders on one side and the other side in order to facilitate and/or ensure the 35 incremental actuation and movement in one rotational direction by the back and forth movement and engagement of the actuation arm 38. Preferably, the actuation element 36 is linearly moveable and/or forms a sliding carriage. Preferably, the actuation element 36 is supported and/or held moveably by the housing 31 , in particular lower part 34 of the housing 31 . However, other constructional solutions are possible as well. The actuation spring 47 acts preferably between the housing 31 or lower part 34 on one hand and the actuation element 36 on the other hand. In the present embodiment, the spring 47 is preferably already compressed and/or biased in the first position and/or biases the actuation element 36 such that it at least partially closes or blocks the insertion opening 54. Preferably, the actuation element 36 comprises an inclined gliding surface 59 at its part protecting into or over the insertion opening 32 in the first position. This surface 59 is inclined such that the insertion of the driving part 52, i.e. its axial movement or abutment, is transformed into a transversal or radial movement of the actuation element 36. Alternatively or additionally, such a surface 59 can also be formed at the driving part 52 to achieve the desired transformation of the axial movement into a transversal or radial movement by means of an inclined plane. Therefore, the actuation or rotation of the transmission 40 or gear 41 is preferably effected by the force of the actuation spring 47 or any other pressure or energy store or spring means. This results in the advantage that no additional force is necessary for driving the indicator device 25 or its indicator element 35. Consequently, the pressurization and dispensing process is not disturbed. Further, the triggering of the counting or actuation of the transmission 40 / gear 41 is effected preferably by the pressurization or dispensing process or movement, i.e. during the actual dispensing of fluid 2, i.e. usually during actual use or inhalation. The actuation spring 47 biases the actuation element 36 preferably towards closing the insertion opening 54. Usually, the movement of the actuation element 36 is restricted so that it does not completely close the insertion opening 54 before the locked state is reached. This limitation is realized in the present embodiment preferably via a control means or portion 62 against which a control part 63 abuts in particular to restrict the back movement of the actuation element 36 at the first position. The abutment is shown in particular in Fig. 10. However, other constructional solutions are possible as well. After the number of uses of the nebulizer 1 with the container 3 has reached or exceeded a predetermined number of uses as detected or registered by the indicator device 25, a locked state is entered and the nebulizer 1 will be locked against further use with the current container 3 and/or the container 3 will be locked against further use with the nebulizer 1 . In particular, the indicator device 25 comprises a blocking part 61 which blocks further use of the container 3 and/or closes or blocks the insertion opening 54 in the locked state as schematically shown in the schematically enlargement of Fig. 15 which shows a similar part as Fig. 4 and 12 to 14. In this shown state, the container 3 has returned to its non-tensioned position and the driving part 52 has been retracted from the indicator device 25. During the last dispensing or pres- surization process, the indicator device 25 has moved the indicator element 35 one step further and detected or registered that the predetermined number of uses has been reached or exceeded and, thus, that the locked state shall be en- tered. In the present embodiment, the indicator element 35 comprises preferably a control portion 62 which releases the actuating element 36 for detection of the locked state which results in locking the nebulizer 1 or current container 3 against further use. Preferably, the control portion 62 comprises a cut out or recess which allows or initiates movement of the blocking part 61 into a blocking position. Preferably, the blocking part 61 blocks or closes the insertion opening 54 in the blocking po- sition, i.e. in the locked state. Preferably the control portion 62 is a wall or ridge on the inside of the rotatable indicator element 35. Preferably, the blocking part 61 is integrated into the indicator device 25 or its housing 31 . The blocking part 61 is preferably moveable transversally or perpendicular to the longitudinal or dispensing direction of the container or nebulizer 1 and/or of the direction of stroke movement of the container 3. Preferably, the blocking part 61 blocks the actuation or insertion movement of the driving part 52, in particular relative to the indicator device 25 and/or (suffi- cient) insertion of the driving part 52. Preferably, the blocking part 61 is linearly moveable and/or formed by a sliding carriage. However, other constructional solutions are possible as well. Preferably, the blocking part 61 is biased into its blocking position, in the present embodiment preferably by actuation spring 47 or any other suitable biasing means. Preferably, the blocking part 61 closes or blocks the insertion opening 54 of the indicator device 25 after the last dose of fluid 2 has been dispensed and when the locked state has been entered or detected. This detection is preferably realized in that the blocking part 61 or any associated component , such as control part 63, can pass the control portion 62 in the locked state, most preferably by spring force, in particular by the force of actuation spring 47 or the like, as schematically shown in Fig. 1 1 . Preferably, the blocking part 61 is connected with or formed by the actuation element 36 or vice versa. Most preferably, the blocking part 61 forms a wall or side, preferably flat side, of the actuation element 36. However, other construc- tional solutions are possible as well. In the present embodiment, the actuation element 36 can move in the locked state from the first position into the third position, i.e. preferably in the opposite direction than the movement into the second position. In the present embodiment, the actuation element 36 can close the insertion opening 54 preferably completely in the third position (blocking position). With other words, the blocking position of the blocking part 61 corresponds preferably to the third position of the actuation element 36. In the locked state or third position, the actuation element 36 has moved with the actuation arm 38 or its portion 39 further in the actuation direction so that the actuation portion 39 has passed the previous tooth 43 in the rotation direction of gear 41 as indicated in Fig. 15. Preferably, the actuation element 36 is constructed to block further use of the container 3 in the locked state or third position (blocking position). Preferably, the actuation element 36 is moveable back and forth between the first and second position for indexing the indicator element 35 and is moveable into a third position to block further use of the container 3 in the locked state. In particular, the closed indicator device 25 or blocking part 61 results in particular in that the container 3 cannot move inside the closed housing of the nebulizer 1 in the stroke-like fashion as previously described and as required for normal or further use so that normal use is prevented . In particular, the locking of the indicator device 25 or insertion opening 54 results in that the nebulizer 1 or housing part 18 is at least partially opened when the nebulizer 1 is tensioned once more or when it is partially tensioned. Fig. 16 shows this state (partially tensioned nebulizer 1 with partially opened housing part 18) in a schematic, longitudinal section of the nebulizer 1 . During the tensioning process the container 3 is moving downwardly together with the indicator device 25. Starting from the non-tensioned state (upper position of the container 3), the indicator device 25 abuts soon with its blocking part 61 / actuating element 36 against the member usually actuating the indicator device 25, here the driving part 52, so that a further usual downward movement is not possible. In particular, the blocking part 61 restricts the axial moveability of the container 3 in the nebulizer 1 in the locked state, preferably by preventing the driving part 52 from insertion into the indicator device 25 or restricting its insertion in the locked state. Due to the force applied when tensioning the nebulizer 1 and due to the resulting axial force in the movement of the container 3, the housing part 18 will be moved outwards or relative to the nebulizer 1 , inner part 17 or upper part 16 together with the container 3 and indicator device 25 during the further tensioning movement in axial direction in the locked state. The above common downward movement of container 3, indicator device 25 and housing part 18 is possible due to a respectively constructed fastening of the housing part 18 at the nebulizer 1 . In particular, the retaining force is selected or set such that it can be overcome by the downward movement of the container 3. In the present embodiment, the retaining element 19 engages with a retaining nose 64 in a respective retaining recess 65 in the housing part 18 or vice versa. Thus, substantially an undercut or indention can be realized. However, the abutting shoulders which extend at least essentially radially of the nose 64 on one hand and the recess 65 on the other hand are slightly inclined, preferably by about 1 ° to 5° to the radial plane such that the axial force of the tensioning process can overcome the retaining force provided by the engagement of the nose 64 into the recess 65 so that the retaining element 19 is flexed radially and the retaining engagement is overcome. Consequently, the housing part 18 is moved downwardly as well and, thus, is pushed at least partly from the nebulizer 1 or separated from the upper housing part 16 and/or pushed from the inner part 17. This pushing or axial displacement of the housing part 18 or any other opening of the nebulizer 1 results preferably in that the nebulizer 1 is locked against further use by means of the locking device 26. Therefore, the indicator device 25 or its blocking part 61 effects indirectly via the opening of the nebulizer 1 the desired locking of the nebulizer 1 in the locked state. In the preferred embodiment, the locking device 26 blocks tensioning of the nebulizer 1 in the locked state. Preferably, the locking device 26 comprises a moveable locking element 66 and an associated locking spring 67. The locking element 66 is preferably axially moveable between a locked position and an unlocked position. The locking element 66 is preferably biased into the locked position by the locking spring 67. In the locked position, the locking element 66 is preferably in its lower axial position shown in Fig. 16. Fig. 17 shows an enlargement of the encircled area of Fig. 16. In the locked position, the locking element 66 blocks rotation of the inner part 17 relative to the outer part 16 and, thus, blocks (further) tensioning of the nebulizer 1 . This is preferably achieved in the present embodiment in that the locking ele- ment 66 moves or engages preferably axially into a respective pocket 68 formed in the upper part 16 such that said relative rotation is blocked. In particular, the locking element 66 engages with an engagement portion 69 into the respective recess or pocket 68 such that any further rotation and/or back rotation is prevented. However, other constructional solutions are possible as well. The locking device 26, in particular the locking element 66 and the locking spring 67, are preferably arranged and/or supported by the inner part 17 and/or extend between the inner part 17 and upper part 16. The nebulizer 1 , inner part 17 or locking device 26 comprises preferably a cover 70 covering the locking device 26 at least on the periphery of the lower part 17b of the inner part 17 in order to prevent or at least complicate any undesired manipulation of the locking device 26 or locking element 66 by a user or patient. Fig. 1 8 shows the nebulizer 1 in a similar schematic section as Fig. 16, however with the locking device 26 in the unlocked position, i.e. the locking element 66 in the upper position. The locking device 26 or locking element 66 is brought into this position or unlocked preferably only by closing the nebulizer 1 , in particular by the housing part 18 in the completely attached or closed position. In the shown embodiment, the housing part 18 comprises a preferably finger-like and/or axially extending actuator 71 which extends into the locking device 66 and/or into the cover 70 and/or axially abuts and/or pushes the locking element 66 into its unlocking position (upper position), as shown in Fig. 18. Thus, only the completely closed nebulizer 1 or housing part 18 unlocks the locking device 26 and, thus, unlocks the nebulizer 1 . The actuator 71 is preferably arranged within the housing part 18 so that any manipulation is not possible or at least complicated. When the nebulizer 1 is in the locked state and, preferably when the nebulizer 1 or its housing part 18 has been opened partially by the last tensioning process, any further use of the nebulizer 1 with the container 3 and the indicator device 25 in its locked state is not possible. The locking device 26 locks preferably automatically. Preferably, the locking spring 67 biases the locking element 66 into the locking position, so that upon at least partial opening of the nebulizer 1 or (axial) displacement of its housing part 18, the locking device 26 or its locking element 66 can move and moves into the locking position. Preferably, the locking element 66 is moveable (essentially or only) in axial direction. After replacement of the current container 3 with its locked indicator device 25 (blocking part 61 in the blocking position) against a new container 3 including a new or reset indicator device 25, the nebulizer 1 or its housing part 18 can be closed completely again. Thus, the nebulizer 1 or its locking device 26 can be or is unlocked again. Preferably, the actuator 71 pushes the locking element 66 back into its unlocking position. Thus, the locking device 26 is reset or unlocked again, preferably by (completely) closing the nebulizer 1 , its housing 24 or housing part 18, and the nebulizer 1 can be used with the new container 3 as previously. It has to be noted that the insertion opening 54, which is preferably arranged centrally and/or opens in axial direction and/or allows axial insertion of an actuator element, in particular the driving part 52 in the present embodiment, can also be formed as a recess, groove, indention or the like and/or can be arranged at any position or location at the indicator device 25 with any orientation. Alternatively, the insertion opening 54 or its closing can also be omitted. Instead, the indicator device 25, actuation element 36 or blocking part 61 can more or less directly communicate with or actuate the locking device 26 or, for example, the retaining element 19 or blocking element 8 in order to cause a direct or indirect locking of the nebulizer 1 or container 3 against further use. Fig. 19 shows in a schematic section the indicator device 25 according to a mod- ified embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 20 shows a perspective view of the section according to Fig. 19. In the following, only relevant differences are described so that the previous explanations and aspects apply in addition, in particular in the same or similar manner, without repetition. In the modified embodiment, the actuation arm 38 and actuation portion 39 do not engage inbetween the worm drive, i.e. between the gear 41 and the engaging protrusions 60 of the driven part, here namely the indicator element 35, but engage with or actuate the gear 41 on another side or the side opposite the worm drive, here preferably in Fig. 19 from below and not from above. In particu- lar, the actuation arm 38 extends more or less in a radial plane and/or more or less in a common plane with the actuation spring 47 and/or blocking part 61 or the sliding carriage part of the actuation element 36. Preferably, the actuation arm 38 or portion 39 engages with the gear 41 on the side opposite the container 3 or gripping section 32. In the modified embodiment, the indicator device 25 counts preferably when the nebulizer 1 is tensioned, i.e. during the tensioning process and not during the dispensing process as provided in the initial embodiment of the present inven- tion. In particular, the actuation element 36 or its arm 38 drives or rotates the transmission 40 or gear 41 , when the driving part 52 is inserted into the indicator device 25, its housing 31 or its insertion opening 54 and/or when the actuation el- ement 36 is moved from the first position to the second position and/or when the actuation element 36 is pushed transversally by the driving part 52. In the opposite direction, the actuation arm or its actuation portion 39 passes the next tooth 43 of the gear 41 , i.e. does not drive the gear 41 . In the modified embodiment, the indicator device 25 or counting is not driven by the force of the actuation spring 47 or any other spring or energy store, but by the relative movement of the indicator device 25 within the nebulizer 1 or by the insertion of an actuator element, such as the driving part 52. However, other constructional solutions are possible as well. In the modified embodiment, the blocking of the carriage / actuation element 36 / locking part 61 to move into the third or locking position are released during the tensioning when a predetermined number of uses is reached or exceeded. Then, the carriage / actuation element 36 / blocking part 61 abut against the driving part 52 because the counting occurs during the tensioning. When the nebulizer 1 is actuated or when the blocking element 8 is depressed, the nebulizer 1 is triggered and the (last) dose of fluid 2 is nebulized. During this nebuli- zation, the driving part 52 is removed from the indicator device 25 or insertion opening 54 so that the carriage / actuation element 36 / blocking part 61 are free to move into the third or locking position due to the force of the actuation spring 47 or any other spring means. During the next tensioning, the nebulizer 1 or its housing 24 or housing part 18 will be partially opened when the driving part 52 abuts against the closed indicator device 25, in particular against the carriage / actuation element 36 / blocking part 61 restricting or closing the insertion opening 54. In the previous embodiment, the counting or actuating of the indicator device 25 takes place or occurs when dispensing fluid, i.e. when the driving part 52 is withdrawn from the insertion opening 54. There, the carriage / actuation element 36 / blocking part 61 are released during the last use of the nebulizer 1 or dispensing, i.e. when moving from the second to the first position so that the car- riage / actuation element 36 / blocking part 61 can move further directly into the third or unlocking position. Thus, any later dispensing is not possible. In both cases, i.e. in the previous embodiment and in the modified embodiment, the indicator device 25 blocks full axial or stroke-moveability of the container 3 within the nebulizer 1 in the locked state and/or causes at least partially opening of the nebulizer housing 24 and/or housing part 18 in the locked state, in particular when the nebulizer 1 is tensioned at least partially for the last time with the current container 3. Further, the at least partial opening of the nebulizer 1 or its housing 24 or housing part 18 results in that the nebulizer 1 is blocked, in particular cannot be tensioned any further or used any further, with the current container 3. Figs. 19 and 20 show the indicator device 26 according to the present invention in the non-actuated or initial state and/or with the actuation element 36 in the first position. The control part 63, which extends preferably upwards and/or in axial direction, abuts against the preferably ring-like control portion 62 which is preferably formed by or at the indicator element 35. Preferably, the control por- tion 62 has a radial distance to the outer wall of the indicator element 35 so that the control part 63 can move inbetween and that the actuation element 36 is free to move between the first and second positions, while the abutment of the control part 63 against the control portion 62 prevents movement of the actuation element 36 from the first position further towards the third position and/or further to (complete) closing the insertion opening 54. Preferably, the protrusions 60 are dent-like and/or are tapered towards its free ends. Preferably, the protrusions 60 are formed on or connected with the control portion 62. Generally, the insertion opening 54 is provided preferably with a conical surface or edge to facilitate insertion of the driving part 52 or the like. Preferably, the support structure 55 forms or comprises one or more flexible arms for moveably holding the piercing part 48, preferably in the center of the indicator device 25 or its housing 31 or a respective opening of the housing 31 , so that the piercing part 48 is usually held inside the indicator device 25 but can move and in particular protrude outwards and/or towards the container 3 for opening or piercing aeration. However, other constructional solutions are possible. Generally, the indicator device 25 and the container 3 form an inseparable assembly or unit, which has to be replaced completely after use, in particular after reaching the locked state. However, it is also possible that the container 3 and indicator device 25 are supplied or offered as a kit which can be assembled by the use or patient. Generally, the indicator device 25 cannot be reset after reaching the locked state so that it cannot be reused. However, it is also possible to modify the indicator device 25 such that it can be reset and reused. In this case, the indicator device 25 has to be separated from the present container 3 and connected with a new (unused) container 3. Most preferably, such a container change would automatically reset the indicator device 25. Generally, the actuation element 36 or blocking part 61 is moveable preferably linearly, in particular like a sliding carriage. In particular, a sliding carriage is formed. Preferably, the sliding carriage forms a base part of the actuation element 36 or blocking part 61 . Preferably, the sliding carriage, actuation element 36 or blocking part 61 is moveably held by sliding guides 72 on opposite sides, preferably on opposite sides of the insertion opening 54, as schematically shown in Figs. 8 and 9. Preferably, the guides 72 are formed by respective rails or the like of the housing 31 or its lower part 34 which grip over respective edges or base portions 73 of the actuation element 36 or blocking part 61 to form the desired sliding guidance. However, other constructional solutions are possible as well. Instead of the preferably linear or sled-like moveable actuation element 36 and/or blocking part 61 , any other motion, in particular a radial and/or pivotal movement, is possible, in particular for partially or completely closing the insertion opening 54. Alternatively, the actuation element 36 and/or blocking part 61 can move outwards from the indicator device 25 or its housing 31 , preferably transversally and/or at one side of the indicator housing 31 for locking at least one engagement possibility and/or actuating any other component in the locked state or for locking the nebulizer 1 and/or container 3. Alternatively or additionally, the actuation element 36 and/or blocking part 61 can engage into or abut against a section or contour of the housing part 18 and/or nebulizer housing 24 or the like in order to restrict or prevent operation or movement in the locked state in order to block further use of the nebulizer 1 and/or container 3 in the locked state. The actuation element 36 and/or blocking part 61 , in particular also when acting radially, are preferably biased by spring 47 or any other spring means. The spring or spring means can be formed integrally and/or by plastic parts or pieces. Alternatively, a spiral or clock spring or any other spring, such as helical spring 47 or the like, could be used for biasing the actuation element 36 and/or blocking part 61 , preferably into the locked state. It is also possible that the driving part 52 directly drives or actuates the gear 41. In this case, the driving part 52 is preferably elastically supported by the housing part 18, in particular via a spring means (not shown), in particular for compensat- ing axial tolerances and/or allowing radial or transversal flexing of the driving part 52. Additionally or alternatively, the driving part 52 may be flexible in order to allow transversal flexing for engaging with the gear 41 only in one direction of relative axial movement to the gear 41 to rotate the gear 41 only in one rotational direction. The indicator device 25 can comprise any other counting mechanism, in particular as described in WO 2009/037085 A1 , page 4, line 19 to page 10, line 13, which is incorporated herein by reference. Such a counting mechanism can also trigger, release or actuate the actuation element 36 and/or blocking part 61 . When using this counting mechanism, the rotatable indicator element 35 can also release or control the release of the carriage, actuation element 36 or blocking part 61 in the locked state to move into the third or locking position or close the insertion opening 54. It is also possible that the carriage or blocking part 61 is independent from the counting. In particular, the driving part 52 may engage the hub of the counting mechanism shown in WO 2009/037085 A1 or the like and/or drive or actuate the indicator device 25 or counting without actuating the carriage or blocking part 61 . In this case, the functions are separated. The carriage and/or blocking part 61 are preferably used only for restricting or closing the insertion opening 54 in the locked state, but not for actuating or driving the indicator device 25 of its counting mechanism or transmission 40 or indicator element 35 or the like. The container 3 or indicator device 25 or insertion opening 54 may be provided with an optional protection 74, shown schematically only in Fig. 19, which covers in particular the insertion opening 54 before the first use. Preferably, the protection 74 has to be removed before the container 3 and/or indicator device 25 can be inserted into the nebulizer 1 or housing part 18. Preferably, the protection 74 extends transversally over the indicator device 25 or its housing 31 and/or over the container 3 and/or has a larger diameter than the indicator device 25 and/or container 3, in particular such that it does not fit into the nebulizer 1 or housing part 18. Preferably, the protection 74 can be removed only irreversibly, i.e. cannot be re- connected after removal. Preferably, the protection 74 covers or closes the insertion opening 54 and/or the indicator device 25. Preferably, the protection 74 is connected to the indicator device 25 or container 3 by form-fit or force-fit and/or by a snap-fit or click-fit. Preferably, the protection 74 is a sealing foil which acts as tamper and/or dust protection of the indicator device 25. According to one preferred embodiment, the protection 74 is automatically opened and/or pierced by the driving part 52 during the first use of a new container 3. Preferably, the protection 74 is fixed to the lower part 34 of the indicator device 25 and/or to the diameter of the flexible arms 56 of the piercing part 48. Preferably, the protection 74 is fixed to the opening of the piercing part 48 resp. on the diameter of the flexible arms 56. Preferably, the piercing part 48 acts as a tamper and/or dust protector itself by sitting in an initial position closing the insertion opening 54 with his outer diameter. Preferably, the piercing part 48 sitting in its initial or non-opening position acts as a stopper for the spring loaded actuation element 36 during storage and is removed by the driving part 52 when a new indicator device 25 is used for the first time. In the following, further preferred embodiments of the indicator device 25 according to the present invention will be explained with reference to the further figures, wherein primarily only new features and aspects are described and the previous explanations and features shall apply in particular additionally or correspondingly even if a respective repetition is omitted. In a further embodiment, the piercing part 48 is preferably held in a non-opening position or within the indicator device 25 before first actuation or use. The piercing part 48 may be held by form-fit, snap-fit or force-fit or by means of a pull- linkage or predetermined breaking point or elastic means or by a flexible or non- flexible suspension, such as a leaf spring, in the non-opening position. In particular, the support structure 55 may form a pull-linkage or provide a (predetermined) breaking point for holding the piercing part 48 in the non-opening position or lower position in the previous embodiment. In the further embodiment, the piercing part 48 is preferably held or secured by the actuation element 36 in the non-opening position before first use or actuation as explained later in detail. Preferably, the piercing part 48 is held or locked - in particular by form-fit, snap- fit or force-fit or by a (plastically) deformed suspension - in an opening or pierc- ing or protruding position after first actuation or use in the further embodiment. A possible realization will be explained later in detail. Fig. 21 shows in a schematic perspective view a preferred construction of the piercing part 48 according to the further embodiment. The piercing part 48 com- prises a preferably longitudinal and/or sleeve-like or hollow body 75. Preferably, the piercing part 48 comprises one or more arms 56 which are arranged preferably on opposite sides and/or received in respective recesses 76 of the piercing part 48 or body 75. In particular, the recesses 76 are break- throughs of the circumferential wall of the body 75 and/or are slit-like and/or extend in axial direction. The arms 56 are longitudinal and/or extend in axial direction and/or can flex radially, in particular outwards. The piercing part 48 or body 75 comprises preferably a side or lateral opening 77 in the region of the lower and or end opposite to the tip 49. In particular, the opening 77 is dimensioned or designed such that the actuation element 36 can engage into the opening 77 in a first or initial position, in particular before first actuation or use. The piercing part 48 or body 75 comprises preferably at least one securing part 78, here two securing parts 78, for cooperation with the indicator device 25, in particular with the actuation element 36, to secure the piercing part 48 by form-fit engagement within the housing 31 or in initial non-opening position, in particular before first use or actuation. In the present embodiment, the securing parts 78 are preferably finger-like and/or protrude in circumferential direction and/or towards each other from opposite rims of the opening 77. However, other constructional solutions are possible. The piercing part 48 comprises preferably a guiding part 79, in particular in form of a longitudinal ridge, and/or a guiding rim 80, in particular extending circumfer- entially at the upper end of the body 75 or adjacent to the piercing tip 49. Preferably, the piercing part 48 or guiding rim 80 provides an axial passage 81 in particular in fluidic communication with a groove 57 for aeration or venting of the container 3 as explained later. Preferably, each arm 56 comprises an inner protrusion or control portion 82 and/or a control surface 85, in particular at or adjacent to the lower or free end. Preferably, each arm 56 comprises an outer protrusion or shoulder 83 and/or is held by an integral hinge or pivot 84, here at the upper end schematically shown in Fig. 21 . Fig. 22 shows the indicator device 25 together with part of the associated container 3 according to the further embodiment in a schematic, perspective section in the initial, non-actuated state. The piercing part 48 is in its non-opening or initial position. The piercing part 48 is held in its non-opening or lower position preferably by form-fit, in particular by preferably lateral engagement of the actuation element 36. In particular, the actuation element 36, at least partially extends over the securing part(s) 78 to realize the preferred holding of the piercing part 48 by form- fit in the shown state / position, i.e. before first actuation or use. However, other constructional solutions are possible as well, e.g. as shown in Fig. 25 and 26 of another embodiment. In the further embodiment, the piercing part 48 is held by form-fit in the non- opening or lower position. However, it is also possible that the piercing part 48 is held by force-fit, snap-fit or biasing in this position. For example, the piercing part 48 can be fixedly connected with the support structure 55 in the initial non-opening position by means of a determined breaking point (not shown) such as a fin arm or the like. This would provide also a form-fit holding of the piercing part 48 before first actuation or use independently from any possible engagement or extension of the actuation element 36 into the piercing part 48. Preferably, the support structure 55 guides and/or holds the piercing part 48. In the shown embodiment the support structure 55 is preferably connected with or formed by the housing 31 or upper part 33 of the indicator device 25. Howev- er, the support structure 55 can also be formed by one or more separate components. In the present embodiment, the support structure 55 is preferably essentially sleeve-like and/or hollow, in particular such that the piercing part 48 can move at least partially inside the support structure 55 from the non-opening or initial position (shown in Fig. 22) to the upper protruding or opening (piercing) position (shown in Fig. 24). Preferably, the indicator device 25, its housing 31 and/or the insertion opening 54 are covered or closed before first actuation or use. In particular, the protection 74 and/or a closure 86 may be provided to close the insertion opening 54 before first use or actuation as schematically shown in Fig. 22. The closure 86 may be provided in addition or alternatively to protection 74. In particular, all aspects and features described with regard to protection 74 apply preferably for the closure 86 as well. In particular, the closure 86 acts as a tamper and/or dust protector, in particular by closing the insertion opening 54. Preferably, the closure 86 covers the insertion opening 54 from the inside. Preferably, the closure 86 is formed at or by or held by the piercing part 48. Preferably, the closure 86 is mounted to the lower end of the piercing part 48 or body 75 and/or to the securing parts 78 or arms 56. In particular, the closure 86 closes the lower end of the piercing part 48 or its body 75. Preferably, the closure 86 is formed by a respective foil or the like. When the nebulizer 1 (completely) closed and/or is used for the first time, in particular tensioned, the closure 86 is opened automatically, preferably in that driving part 52 enters through the insertion opening 54 and opens or pierces or breaks the protection 74 and/or closure 86. Fig. 23 shows in a partial enlargement of a section similar to Fig. 22, but in a vertical plane, an intermediate state wherein the driving part 52 has already partially been moved inside the indicator device 25 and has already partially moved the piercing part 48 upwards. The indicator device 25 or support structure 55 comprises preferably a holding portion 87 which is in particular hook-like and/or provides a preferably axial abutment or stop 88 for the piercing part 48 or an associated arm 56 thereof. In particular holding portions 87 or stops 88 are provided and/or arranged to cooperate with the respective arms 56. In the shown embodiment, the holding portion 87 and/or stops 88 are preferably formed by inner protrusion 5, shoulders or the like. Preferably, the holding portions 87 or stops 88 flex or keep the arms 56 in a radially inward position and/or such that the arms 56 cannot flex outwards and/or away from each other. ln particular, the holding portions 87 or stops 88 are arranged at a lower location and/or lower end of the support structure 55 so that the shoulders 83 and/or arms 56 can pass the holding portions 87 or stops 88 when the piercing part 48 moves - in the drawing upwards - to the final actuated or opening position. Preferably, the driving part 52 abuts against a lower end of the piercing part 48 or against lower ends or the control surfaces 85 of the arms 56 at the beginning of the actuation of the piercing part 48. This is still the case in the intermediate position shown in Fig. 23. Thus, the (axial) movement of the driving part 52 into the indicator device 25 actuates or pushes or moves the piercing part 48 from the initial non-opening position - here in the drawing upwards - up to the final opening position shown in Fig. 24. When the piercing part 48 has reached its final opening or piercing position, the arms 56 can flex or pivot outwards to hold the piercing part 48 in this position and/or to allow the driving part 52 to move further upwards and/or inbetween the arms 56 and/or (further) into the piercing part 48. Thus, the indicator device 25 or piercing part 48 comprises preferably a com- pensation means or portion, here preferably formed by the arms 56 or the possibility to flex outwards, which allows to compensate axial tolerances and/or (axial) over travel or movement of the driving part 52 into the indicator device 25 so that the piercing part 48 or its tip 49 does not move beyond a desired opening position towards or into the container 3 or its aeration opening or venting hole 23. It has to be noted that other constructional solutions are possible as well in order to realize the preferred compensation means or portion for compensating (axial) tolerances or over-travel. For example, the piercing part 48 may comprise a spring or spring portion as already mentioned which can serve the same pur- pose and which is also realized by aeration spring 20 shown in Figures 1 and 2. Preferably, the piercing part 48 or its arms 56 can grip over the holding portion^) 87 and/or abut against stop(s) 88 in the upper or opening position of the piercing part 48 so that the piercing part 48 is locked or held, in particular by form-fit, snap-fit or force-fit in this position and/or against backwards or downwards movement, so that the piercing part 48 is decoupled from any further (axial) movement of the driving part 52. Thus, the indicator device 25 or driving part 48 and/or support structure 55 comprise or form preferably a lock for - preferably unrealeasably - locking or holding the piercing part 48 in the upper or final or opening position as shown in Fig. 24. This lock is preferably formed by the arms 56 and/or the cooperation with sup- port structure 55 in the present further embodiment. However, other constructional solutions are possible for realizing the preferred lock. In the opening position, the piercing part 48 or its tip 49 has opened, broken or pierced the aeration, in particular the aeration opening or venting hole 23 and/or an associated closure or foil 50 as schematically shown in Fig. 24. Preferably, the at least one channel 57 and associated passage 81 ensures aeration of the container 3. In the shown embodiment the foil 50 forms preferably the closure of the aeration, here venting hole 23 formed in the base 21 of the container 3. However, the aeration opening or venting hole 23 may be closed by an additional closure (not shown) which may be opened or pushed inwards by the piercing part 48 or its tip 49 which may extend up to or even into the aeration opening or venting hole 23 in the opening position as shown in Fig. 24. However, it is also possible that the piercing part 48 or its tip 49 do not extend up to or into the venting hole 23 in the opening position, but just through the foil 50 or any respective closure. Preferably, the at least one groove or channel 57 extends up to the piercing tip 49, in particular at least partially at the side of the tip 49, and/or radially and/or is formed on the end or radially extending face of the piercing part 48 so that the desired aeration is securely achieved, in particular even if the foil 50 or the like lies on the piercing part 48 and/or at the piercing tip 49. Preferably, the piercing part 48 or its tip 49 opens or pierces the foil 50 such that one or more flaps of the foil 50 are formed and/or folded upwards in the region of the opening or piercing. In particular, the flaps may lay against the side(s) of the tip 49. The preferred groove or channel 57 ensures that the desired aeration is achieved even if the flaps at least partially cover sides of the piercing tip 49 as schematically indicated in Fig. 24. Preferably, the piercing part 48 extends with its tip 49 through the foil 50 by such an amount or distance that the free end of the tip 49 securely extends over the foil 50 or flaps or the like formed by the foil 50. 5 Preferably, the piercing tip 49 is formed by two portions with different inclination so that the piercing tip 49 has a smaller conical angle at its free end to provide a very sharp free end, and has a greater conical angle at its base adjacent to the piercing part 48. However, other geometric forms are possible as well. i o In the present embodiment, the piercing tip 49 is preferably pyramidal or conical. Preferably, the indicator device 25 or piercing part 48 is designed such that the piercing part 48 cannot be moved backwards or withdrawn after the foil 50 has been opened or pierced. In particular, the lock mentioned above is realized such 15 that the piercing part 48 is locked in two steps or at two (axial) positions. Preferably, the shoulders 83 or respective outer protrusions of the arms 56 can pass the holding portions 87 or stops 88 when the piercing part 48 is moving from the non-opening position to the opening position and lock or block the 0 piercing part 48 against reverse movement. Thus, a first, additional or intermediate locking is preferably provided and, in particular, achieved by abutment of the shoulders 83 against stops 88 in an intermediate position (which is not yet reached in the intermediate position shown in 5 Fig. 23) so that the piercing part 48 has already pierced the foil 50 and cannot move downwards again. Then, the piercing part 48 can be moved further towards the container 3 and/or outwards of the indicator device 25, in particular into a second or the final, open- 0 ing (axial) position where the piercing part 48 is finally locked, in particular by the free ends of the arms 56 on stops 88. Preferably, the control surfaces 85 are inclined inwardly and/or conically so that the driving part 52 can abut with its circumferential edge at the free end when 5 moving axially upwards or into the indicator device 25 so that the arms 56 are moved or pushed outwards after the shoulders 83 have passed the holding portions 87 / stops 88 and/or after the arms 56 or its free ends have passed the holding portions 87 / stops 88. Alternatively and/or additionally, the arms 56 are preferably biased outwards, and/or into a locking position in particular by respective construction of the hinges or pivots 84 and/or an additional biasing device (not shown). The piercing part 48 is preferably made of plastics and/or metal. The piercing part 48 is preferably a one-piece or integral construction, but can be assembled by different parts which may be formed from different materials. In the further embodiment, the indicator device 25 or support structure 55 guides the piercing part 48 such that it is axially moveable, at least from the initial or non-opening position to the final or opening position. Preferably, the piercing part 48 is axially and/or torsionally guided. In particular, the support structure 55 comprises a groove 89 and/or inner shape such that the piercing part 48 or its guiding part 79 and/or guiding rim 80 is received and axially moveable guided by or within the support structure 55. However, other constructional solutions are possible as well. It has to be noted that the indicator device 25 is triggered or driven or actuated and the opening of the aeration or actuation of the piercing part 48 is realized or accomplished preferably by the axial movement of the indicator device 25 (together with the container 3) within the nebulizer 1 and/or preferably by the driving part 52, in particular its axial (relative) movement or insertion. Another embodiment will be explained in the following with reference to Figs. 25 and 26. The functionality of this other embodiment is highly similar to the functionality and construction of the further embodiment already explained with reference to Figures 21 to 24 so that the following description will focus on the pre- ferred other realization of the lock or holding device 90 for holding the piercing part 48 - in particular by form-fit, force-fit and/or snap-fit - in the initial or non- opening position and/or in the opening position. Fig. 25 shows the indicator device 25 in a schematic section similar to Fig. 19. The piercing part 48 is in its initial or non-opening position, i.e. here within the indicator housing 31 and/or without protruding outwards with its (piercing) tip 49. Fig. 26 shows the indicator device 25 according to the other embodiment in a section similar to Fig. 25, but with the piercing part 48 in its final or opening position. In the other embodiment, the indicator device 25 or support structure 55 comprises or forms a holding device 90 for holding the piercing part 48 in the non- opening position and/or in the opening position. In particular, the holding device 90 comprising at least one, here two holding arms 91 and/or locking portions 92. Preferably, the holding arms 91 are supported or held by the support structure 55 or its holding portion(s) 87. In particular, the holding arms 91 extend axially and/or upwards from the (respective) holding portion(s) 87. Preferably, the holding arms 91 can flex (with its free or upper ends) radially, in particular outwards. Preferably, the locking portions 92 are nose-like and/or protrude radially and/or inwards. Preferably, the locking portions 92 are formed by the holding arms 91 and/or are arranged at least near free ends of the holding arms 92 and/or at the side of the piercing part 48. The or each holding portion 87 is preferably held by means of a support portion 93 or connected via the support portion 93 with the support structure 55 and/or indicator housing 31 or upper part 33. However, other constructional solutions are possible as well. In the shown embodiment, the arms 56 of the piercing part 50 are preferably held together by the at least partial circumferential extension of the holding por- tion(s) 87 on the outside of the arms 56, in particular in the region if the free ends of the arms 56. This is preferably similar to the realization in the further embodiment already described. The guiding grove 89 may be formed between the holding portions 87 and/or support portions 93. Preferably, the piercing part 48 is axially moveable, but radially guided in particu- lar within the support structure 55. In particular, the support portions 93 can radially guide the piercing part 48, preferably its rim 80. Further, or additionally the piercing part 48 may engage with its guiding part 79 (not shown in Figures 25 and 26) or the like between the support portions 93 or into the guiding grove 89 to radially and/or torsionally guide the piercing part 48 but allow the desired axial opening movement. However, other structional solutions are possible as well. In the initial or non-opening position, the piercing part 48 is preferably held by the holding device 90 or its locking portion(s) 92, in particular, in an upper region and/or near the tip 49. In particular, the locking portions 92 grip over the rim 80 as shown schematically in Fig. 25, or over any other portion of the piercing part 48. Thus, the piercing part 48 is preferably held by force-fit or snap-fit in the initial or non-opening position, in particular before first use or actuation preferably by the driving part 52 (not shown). When the piercing part 48 is actuated, in particular moved upwards by means of the driving part 52 (not shown) over any other actuation, the holding force can be overcome and/or the holding arms 91 and/or locking portions 92 can flex, preferably due to a respective inclination of the rim 80 and/or locking portion(s) 92, in particular radially outwards, so that the piercing part 48 can move to the opening position, in particular so that the rim 80 or the like can pass the locking portions 92. Fig. 26 shows the piercing part 48 in its final or opening position. In particular, the piercing part 48 or its rim 80 has passed the locking portions 92 and the holding arms 91 have flexed backwards and/or inwards so that the piercing part 48 is preferably held again by the holding device 90 or locking portions 92, but now in the opening position, and/or is locked against backward or downward movement. Preferably, the holding device 90 or locking portion(s) 92 grip(s) under a portion or the rim 80 of the piercing part 48 to hold or lock - preferably unreleasably - the piercing part 48 by form-fit or snap-fit in the piercing position. Alternatively or additionally, the arms 56 may hold or lock the piercing part 48 in the opening position as already described with reference to the further embodiment. In particular, the arms 56 of the piercing part 48 flex radially outwards after having passed the holding portion(s) or stops 88. It has to be noted that the outwards flexing of the arms 56 and/or the holding or locking of the piercing part 48 in the final or opening position is advantageous for reducing the necessary forces to move the driving part 52 back and forth relative to the indicator device 25 as the piercing part 48 has to be moved only once during the first actuation. As already mentioned, individual features, aspects and/or principles of the embodiments described may also be combined with one another as desired and may be used particularly in the shown nebulizers 1 but also in similar or different nebulizers. Features of the different embodiments can be combined or exchanged. Unlike freestanding equipment or the like the proposed nebulizer 1 is preferably designed to be portable and in particular is a mobile hand operated device. The proposed solution may, however, be used not only in the nebulizers 1 specifically described here but also in other nebulizers or inhalers, e.g. powder inhalers or so-called metered dose inhalers. Preferably, the fluid 2 is a liquid, as already mentioned, especially an aqueous pharmaceutical formulation or an ethanolic pharmaceutical formulation. However, it may also be some other pharmaceutical formulation, a suspension or the like. According to an alternative embodiment the fluid 2 may also comprise particles or powder. In this case, instead of the expulsion nozzle 12, some other kind of supply device may be provided, especially an expulsion opening (not shown) or a supply channel (not shown) for supplying the fluid to or powder or the like into the mouthpiece 13. The optional air supply opening 15 then serves to supply ambient air preferably in parallel so as to general or allow an airflow with a sufficient volume for breathing in or inhaling through the mouthpiece 13. If necessary the fluid 2 may also be atomized by means of a propellant gas. Preferred ingredients and/or formulations of the preferably medicinal fluid 2 are listed in particular in WO 2009/1 15200 A1 , preferably on pages 25 to 40, or in EP 2 614 848 A1 , paragraphs 0040 to 0087, which are incorporated herewith by reference.
