Ijiiii? i I• \ I ll 2t í P.E.Demers Case I This invention relates to intercommunication systems and particularly to two-way office intercommunication systems of the loudspeaking type, Each station of a coi uication system of the aboveindicated type is equipped with closely associated speech transmlttingmicrophones and loudspeaking receivers and due to the acoustic coupling of such speech input and output devices, serious plantations have been imposed on the overall efficiency of such systems, Various methods of reducing the effects of acoustic coupling bave been devised in the past and usually h are involved complex circuit arrangements and highly sensitive controls which necessarily increase the initial and maintenance costs of such systems and in many cases render the cost prohibitiveo One of the common methods resorted to involves the use of a =talk-listenoe key which imposes upon the user the objectionable task of operating a key to one position during the speech transmitting period and reoperating the key to another position during the speech receiving period It la the object of this invention to l ovide a simple, inexpensive and efficient loudspeaking communication system in which the effects of acoustic coupling are entirely eliminated without imposing on the user any requirements other than those incidental to the normal activation of the microphone by speech 24'1 slgnalso. It is well known that ordinary speech contains ai1 frs26 quenches from lO0 cycles up, and that better than 90 per cent 27 articulation can be obtained with speech if ai1 frequencies above 28 400 cycles are utilized for speech purposes. In other words» all 29 speech frequencies below 400 cycles may be eliminated from the speech frequency band without noticeably affecting the quality of reintroduction. /: '.>,?;%í-::":'::,i.: ::.::: ', ;,i.!,:.: :: ,':::::::1:..:: ::. ::::;';::: ,.:;: : :.::::, ':i!::i!:?;i: :- ::': ..... :; '.,..,' ...... ,..:.= ,- :,", ............ .ï "::::, : :;;:1::...:. ,"::!:. :::.:::.' ' .' : . ï, P.E.Demers Case I 6 7 In accordance with a feature o£ this invention those frequencies of speech which are not essential to substantially perfect articulation are eliminated from the speech frequency band during speech transmission and are utilized to control the speech transmitting and receiving channels in such a manner that the transmitting channel is automatically rendered effective, under control of the eliminated frequencies, to transmit the remaiming frequencies of the speech band, and the receiving channel Il IS is simultaneously disabled, A further feature of the invention contemplates the provision of a signalise means at each station of the communication system which responds to the activation of the transmitting microphone at another station to visually indicate such occurrence, These and other features of the invention will be best 16 understood from the following description when read in connection 17 with the accompanying drawing which shows a two-way loudspeaking 18 office intercommunicating system embodying the features of the 19 .invention The system disclosed in the drawing, by way of illustra, 21 tion» shows two stations & and B of an intercommunication system 22 each of which is equipped with a microphone 10 and a loudspeaking receiver 12.which respectively terminate the speech transmitting and receiving channels IS and. 14 at their respective stations. The remaining equipment for each station comprises a one-way amplifier 15» a dividing network 16, a full-wave copper oxide rectifier lç and a fast operating, slow releasing relay 18e & lamp signal 19 may be located at each station The microphones I0» loudspeakers 12 and amplifiers may be of any well-known designs The dividing network consists of an inductance toll S0 and a condenser SI serially connected « l P.E.Demers Case I together and bridged across the output of the amplifier 15, Thls dividing network is subjected to the frequencies of the speech signais impressed on the microphone I0 and amplified by 4 amplifier 15» and functions as a means for separating these frequencies into two subbands of frequencies, one subband 6 including those frequencies of the speech band above 400 cycles 7 and the other subband include those frequencies of the speech 8 band below 400 cycles. The frequencies above 400 cycles appear 9 In the coll 20 whereas the frequencies below 400 cycles are I0 derived across the terminals of the condenser 21, The input Il terminals of full-wave rectifier 17 are connected to the 12 terminals of condenser 21 so that the rectifier is subjected to, and rectifies only currents of the frequencies below 400 cycles, 14 The relay 18 Is connected to the output terminals of rectifier 17 and therefore responds selectively to the subband of frequencies 16 . below 400 cycles Relay 18 at ifs two upper armatures and front contacts controls the connection of the outgoing speech transmitting channel at each station to the coil 20 of the corresponding dividing network. AI its first and second lower armatures and front contacts relay 18 of each station controls the speech receiving channel 14 of the corresponding station, it being observed that, with the relays 18 in their normal unoperated condition the speech channel 13 of station & is disconnected from the speech receiving channel 14 at station B add similarly, the speech channel 13 of station B is disconnected from the receiving channel 14 at station &e When operated, relays 18 effect the continuity of the speech channels interconnecting the two stattonse The system operates in the following manner When the í microphone I0 at station A, for example, has impressed thereon " " " " ' • i. ::i i¸ : ï -.:-: .... : : « ..... ï '. . P.E.Demers Case I ii':;i'!:ii 1 speech signais, these signais are amplified at 15 and impressed i!i:S:': 2 upon the dividing network 16. The dividing network functions to separate the speech frequency band into two subbands, one sub4 band containing frequencies above 400 cycles appearing at the terminals of coll 20 and the other subband containing frequencies 6 below 400 cycles appearing at the terminals of condenser 21o 7 The current of the lower frequency band is rectified at 8 IV and traverses the winding of relay 18 as rectified current to 9 which current the relay responds. Relay 18 accordingly operates I0 quickly and at its two upper armatures and front contacts connect| Il the speech channel, or llne C to the output terminals of coil 20» 12 and at its first and second lower armatures and front contacts I disconnects the loudspeaker 12 from the speech channel, or llne 14 Do Speech channels, or lines C and D constitute connecting links between the stations A and B. Thus the subband of , 16 frequencies containing those frequencies above 400 cycles and 17 which furnish substantially perfect speech articulation are 18 projected over channel C to be reproduced by the loudspeaker 19 12 at station B, it being observed that channel D is connected .... 20 through to channel 14 and the loudspeaker 12 by the first and 21 second, lower armatures and back contacts of relay 18 at station 22 Bo Thus those frequencies above 400 cycles which are impressed on the microphone I0 at station A are reproduced by the loud24 speaker 12 st station Be • 25 If well-known be observed that since only these 26 frequencies above 400 cycles are reproduced by the loudspeaker 27 12 at station B» their Impinging on the microphone 10 at 28 station B will be ineffectual to disturb the speech paths 29 between the stations since relay 18 at station B responds to frequencies only below 400 cycles, The effects of acoustic 51 coupling are therefore eliminated since the acoustic energy from -5m !i ! ;iz!::1' 2 i ll ç? ;, 18 22' : 28 P.E.Demers Case I the loudspeaker does not contain the frequency components required to operate the relay. It will be observed further that should the parties at stations A and B attempt to talk simultaneously, a condition of silence would prevail since, under this condition, both relays 18 would be operated. To insure against the simultaneous talking of both parties, a lamp signal Ig may be provided at each station so as to be lighted when the relay at the other station is operated. Thus when relay 18 of station A is operated the third lower armature and front contact thereof complete an energizing circuit for lamp lg at station B. Lamp 19 is lighted in this circuit to visually indicate to the party at station B that he should not talk at this time but should wait until the lamp 19 is extinguished marking the cessation of speech at station & and the consequent deenergization of relay 18 thereat, The lamp 19 at station A is similarly controlled by relay 18 of station B and serves a similar purpose The purpose of the network 25 is. to introduce a loss in the local speaker sufficient to prevent acoustic feedback but leaving an adequate level to hear the speech when both parties happen to talk at the same time and when relay 18 is not equipped to open the circuit to the local speaker It is apparent from the foregoing description that only those frequencies of' the speech band which are necessary tO the production of substantially perfect speech articulation are utilized for speech transmission, and those frequencies which are not essential to good speech articulation are eliminated from the speech and are employed to control the completion and disabling of the transmitting and receiving paths respectively» at each station, i'i :::!.¸ " L .... !,i i ii :.i / "i*i.' .
