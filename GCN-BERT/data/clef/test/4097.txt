[0007] Described herein are embodiments of stationary exercise machines having reciprocating foot and/or hand members, such as foot pedals that move in a closed loop path. Some embodiments can comprise reciprocating foot pedals that cause a user's feet to move along a closed loop path that is substantially inclined, such that the foot motion simulates a climbing motion more than a flat walking or running motion. Some embodiments can further comprise reciprocating handles that are configured to move in coordination with the foot via a linkage to a crank wheel also coupled to the foot pedals. Variable resistance can be provided via a rotating air-resistance based mechanism, via a magnetism based mechanism, and/or via other mechanisms, one or more of which can be rapidly adjustable while the user is using the machine. [0008] Some embodiments of a stationary exercise machine comprise first and second reciprocating foot pedals each configured to move in a respective closed loop path, with each of the closed loop paths defining a major axis extending between two points in the closed loop path that are furthest apart from each other, and wherein the major axis of the closed loop paths is inclined more than 45° relative to a horizontal plane. The machine comprises at least one resistance mechanism configured to provide resistance against motion of the foot pedals along their closed loop paths, with the resistance mechanism comprising an adjustable portion configured to change the magnitude of the resistance provided by the resistance mechanism at a given reciprocation frequency of the foot pedals, and such that the adjustable portion is configured to be readily adjusted by a user of the machine while the user is driving the foot pedals with his feet during exercise. [0009] In some embodiments, the adjustable portion is configured to rapidly adjust between two predetermined resistance settings, such as in less than one second. In some embodiments, the resistance mechanism is configured to provide increased resistance as a function of increased reciprocation frequency of the foot pedals. [0010] In some embodiments, the resistance mechanism comprises an air-resistance based resistance mechanism wherein rotation of the air-resistance based resistance mechanism draws air into a lateral air inlet and expels the drawn in air through radial air outlets. The air- resistance based resistance mechanism can comprise an adjustable air flow regulator that can be adjusted to change the volume of air flow through the air inlet or air outlet at a given rotational velocity of the air-resistance based resistance mechanism. The adjustable air flow regulator can comprise a rotatable plate positioned at a lateral side of the air-resistance based resistance mechanism and configured to rotate to change a cross-flow area of the air inlet, or the adjustable air flow regulator can comprise a axially movable plate positioned at a lateral side of the air-resistance based resistance mechanism and configured to move axially to change the volume of air entering the air inlet. The adjustable air flow regulator can be configured to be controlled by an input of a user remote from the air-resistance based resistance mechanism while the user is driving the foot pedals with his feet. [0011] In some embodiments, the resistance mechanism comprises a magnetic resistance mechanism that comprises a rotatable rotor and a brake caliper, the brake caliper comprising magnets configured to induce an eddy current in the rotor as the rotor rotates between the magnets, which causes resistance to the rotation of the rotor. The brake caliper can be adjustable to move the magnets to different radial distances away from an axis of rotation of the rotor, such that increasing the radial distance of the magnets from the axis increases the amount of resistance the magnets apply to the rotation of the rotor. The adjustable brake caliper can be configured to be controlled by an input of a user remote from the magnetic resistance mechanism while the user is driving the foot pedals with his feet. Some embodiments of a stationary exercise machine comprise a stationary frame, first and second reciprocating foot pedals coupled to the frame with each foot pedal configured to move in a respective closed loop path relative to the frame, a crank wheel rotatably mounted to the frame about a crank axis with the foot pedals being coupled to the crank wheel such that reciprocation of the foot pedals about the closed loop paths drives the rotation of the crank wheel, at least one handle pivotably coupled to the frame about a first axis and configured to be driven by a user's hand, wherein the first axis is substantially parallel to and fixed relative to the crank axis. The machine further comprises a first linkage fixed relative to the handle and pivotable about the first axis and having a radial end extending opposite the first axis, a second linkage having a first end pivotally coupled to the radial end of the first linkage about a second axis that is substantially parallel to the crank axis, a third linkage that is rotatably coupled to a second end of the second linkage about a third axis that is substantially parallel to the crank axis, wherein the third linkage is fixed relative to the crank wheel and rotatable about the crank axis. The machine is configured such that pivoting motion of the handle is synchronized with motion of one of the foot pedals along its closed loop path. [0012] In some embodiments, the second end of the second linkage comprises an annular collar and the third linkage comprises a circular disk that is rotatably mounted within the annular collar. [0013] In some embodiments, the third axis passes through the center of the circular disk and the crank axis passes through the circular disk at a location offset from the center of the circular disk but within the annular collar. [0014] In some embodiments, the frame can comprise inclined members having non-linear portions configured to cause intermediate portions of the reciprocating foot members to move in non-linear paths, such as by causing rollers attached to the intermediate portions of the foot members to roll along the non-linear portions of the inclined members. [0015] The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.

Detailed Description [0034] Described herein are embodiments of stationary exercise machines having reciprocating foot and/or hand members, such as foot pedals that move in a closed loop path. The disclosed machines can provide variable resistance against the reciprocal motion of a user, such as to provide for variable-intensity interval training. Some embodiments can comprise reciprocating foot pedals that cause a user's feet to move along a closed loop path that is substantially inclined, such that the foot motion simulates a climbing motion more than a flat walking or running motion. Some embodiments can further comprise reciprocating hand members that are configured to move in coordination with the foot pedals and allow the user to exercise the upper body muscles. Variable resistance can be provided via a rotating air-resistance based fan-like mechanism, via a magnetism based eddy current mechanism, via friction based brakes, and/or via other mechanisms, one or more of which can be rapidly adjustable while the user is using the machine to provide variable intensity interval training. [0035] FIGS. 1-7Α show an exemplary embodiment of an exercise machine 10. The machine 10 comprises a frame 12 comprising a base 14 for contact with a support surface, first and second vertical braces 16 coupled by an arched brace 18, an upper support structure 20 extending above the arched brace 18, and first and second inclined members 22 that extend between the base 14 and the first and second vertical braces 16, respectively. [0036] A crank wheel 24 is fixed to a crank shaft 25 (see FIGS. 4Α and 5Α) that is rotatably supported by the upper support structure 20 and rotatable about a fixed horizontal crank axis A. First and second crank arms 28 are fixed relative to the crank wheel 24 and crank shaft 25 and positioned on either side of the crank wheel and also rotatable about the crank axis A, such that rotation of the crank arms 28 causes the crank shaft 25 and the crank wheel 24 to rotate about the crank axis A. The first and second crank arms 28 have respective inner ends fixed to the crank shaft 25 at the crank axis A and respective radial ends that extend in opposite radial directions from the crank axis A. First and second reciprocating foot members 26 have forward ends that are pivotably coupled to the radial ends of the first and second crank arms 28, respectively, and rearward ends that are coupled to first and second foot pedals 32, respectively. First and second rollers 30 are coupled to intermediate portions of the first and second foot members 26, respectively, such that the rollers 30 can rollingly translate along the inclined members 22 of the frame 12. In alternative embodiments, other bearing mechanisms can be used to facilitate translational motion of the foot members 26 along the inclined members 22 instead of or in addition to the rollers 30, such as sliding friction-type bearings. [0037] When the foot pedals 32 are driven by a user, the intermediate portions of the foot members 26 translate in a substantially linear path via the rollers 30 along the inclined members 22. In alternative embodiments, the inclined members 22 can comprise a non-linear portion, such as a curved or bowed portion (e.g., see the curved inclined members 123 in FIG. 17), such that intermediate portions of the foot members 26 translate in non-linear path via the rollers 30 along the non-linear portion of the inclined members 22. The non-linear portion of the inclined members 22 can have any curvature, such as a constant or non-constant radius of curvature, and can present convex, concave, and/or partially linear surfaces for the rollers to travel along. In some embodiments, the non-linear portion of the inclined members 22 can have an average angle of inclination of at least 45°, and/or can have a minimum angle of inclination of at least 45°, relative to a horizontal ground plane. [0038] The front ends of the foot members 26 can move in circular paths about the rotation axis A, which circular motion drives the crank arms 28 and the crank wheel 24 in a rotational motion. The combination of the circular motion of the forward ends of the foot members 26 and the linear or non-linear motion of the intermediate portions of the foot members causes the pedals 32 at the rearward ends of the foot members 26 to move in non-circular closed loop paths, such as substantially ovular and/or substantially elliptical closed loop paths. For example, with reference to FIG. 7Α, a point F at the front of the pedals 32 can traverse a path 60 and a point R at the rear of the pedals can traverse a path 62. The closed loop paths traversed by different points on the foot pedals 32 can have different shapes and sizes, such as with the more rearward portions of the pedals 32 traversing longer distances. For example, the path 60 can be shorter and/or narrower than the path 62. A closed loop path traversed by the foot pedals 32 can have a major axis defined by the two points of the path that are furthest apart. The major axis of one or more of the closed loop paths traversed by the pedals 32 can have an angle of inclination closer to vertical than to horizontal, such as at least 45°, at least 50°, at least 55°, at least 60°, at least 65°, at least 70°, at least 15°, at least 80°, and/or at least 85°, relative to a horizontal plane defined by the base 14. To cause such inclination of the closed loop paths of the pedals, the inclined members can comprise a substantially linear or non-linear portion (e.g., see inclined members 123 in FIG. 17) over which the rollers traverse that forms a large angle of inclination a, an average angle of inclination, and/or a minimum angle of inclination, relative to the horizontal base 14, such as at least 45°, at least 50°, at least 55°, at least 60°, at least 65°, at least 70°, at least 15°, at least 80°, and/or at least 85°. This large angle of inclination of the foot pedal motion can provide a user with a lower body exercise more akin to climbing than to walking or running on a level surface. Such a lower body exercise can be similar to that provided by a traditional stair climbing machine. [0039] The machine 10 can also comprise first and second handles 34 coupled to the upper support structure 20 of the frame 12 at a horizontal axis D. Rotation of the handles 34 about the horizontal axis D causes corresponding rotation of the first and second links 38, which are pivotably coupled at their radial ends to first and second reciprocating members 40. As shown in FIGS. 4Α and 5Α, for example, the lower ends of the reciprocating members 40 comprise respective annular collars 41. A respective circular disk 42 is rotatably mounted within each of the annular collars 41, such that the disks 42 are rotatable relative to the reciprocating members 40 and collars 41 about respective disk axes Β at the center of each of the disks. The disk axes Β are parallel to the fixed crank axis A and offset radially in opposite directions from the fixed crank axis A (see FIGS. 4Α and 5Α). As the crank wheel 24 rotates about the crank axis A, the disk axes Β move in opposite circular orbits about the axis A of the same radius. The disks 42 are also fixed to the crank shaft 25 at the crank axis A, such that the disks 42 rotate within the respective annular collars 41 as the disks 42 pivot about the crank axis A on opposite sides of the crank wheel 24. The disks 42 can be fixed relative to the respective crank arms 28, such that they rotate in unison around the crank axis A to crank the crank wheel 24 when the pedals 32 and/or the handles 34 are driven by a user. The handle linkage assembly, comprising handles 34, pivot axis 36, links 38, reciprocating members 40, and disks 42, can be configured to cause the handles 34 to reciprocate in an opposite motion relative to the pedals 32. For example, as the left pedal 32 is moving upward and forward, the left handle 34 pivots rearward, and vice versa. The crank wheel 24 can be coupled to one or more resistance mechanisms to provide resistance to the reciprocation motion of the pedals 32 and handles 34. For example, the one or more resistance mechanisms can comprise an air-resistance based resistance mechanism 50, a magnetism based resistance mechanism, a friction based resistance mechanism, and/or other resistance mechanisms. One or more of the resistance mechanisms can be adjustable to provide different levels of resistance. Further, one or more of the resistance mechanisms can provide a variable resistance that corresponds to the reciprocation frequency of the exercise machine, such that resistance increases as reciprocation frequency increases. [0040] As shown in FIGS. 1-7, the machine 10 comprises an air-resistance based resistance mechanism, or air brake 50 that is rotationally mounted to the frame 12. The air brake 50 is driven by the rotation of the crank wheel 24. In the illustrated embodiment, the air brake 50 is driven by a belt or chain 48 that is coupled to a pulley 46, which is further coupled to the crank wheel 24 by another belt or chain 44 that extends around the perimeter of the crank wheel. The pulley 46 can be used as a gearing mechanism to adjust the ratio of the angular velocity of the air brake to the angular velocity of the crank wheel 24. For example, one rotation of the crank wheel 24 can cause several rotations of the air brake 50 to increase the resistance provided by the air brake. [0041] The air brake 50 can comprise a radial fin structure that causes air to flow through the air brake when it rotates. For example, rotation of the air brake can cause air to enter through lateral openings 52 on the lateral side of the air brake near the rotation axis and exit through radial outlets 54 (see FIGS. 4 and 5). The induced air motion through the air brake 50 causes resistance to rotation, which is transferred to resistance to the reciprocation motions of the pedals 32 and handles 34. As the angular velocity of the air brake 50 increases, the resistance force created can increase in a non-linear relationship, such as a substantially exponential relationship. [0042] In some embodiments, the air brake 50 can be adjustable to control the volume of air flow that is induced to flow through the air brake at a given angular velocity. For example, in some embodiments, the air brake 50 can comprise a rotationally adjustable inlet plate 53 (see FIG. 5) that can be rotated relative to the air inlets 52 to change the total cross-flow area of the air inlets 52. The inlet plate 53 can have a range of adjustable positions, including a closed position where the inlet plate 53 blocks substantially the entire cross-flow area of the air inlets 52, such that there is no substantial air flow through the fan. [0043] In some embodiments (not shown), an air brake can comprise an inlet plate that is adjustable in an axial direction (and optionally also in a rotational direction like the inlet plate 53). An axially adjustable inlet plate can be configured to move in a direction parallel to the rotation axis of the air brake. For example, when the inlet plate is further away axially from the air inlet(s), increased air flow volume is permitted, and when the inlet plate is closer axially to the air inlet(s), decreased air flow volume is permitted. [0044] In some embodiments (not shown), an air brake can comprise an air outlet regulation mechanism that is configured to change the total cross-flow area of the air outlets 54 at the radial perimeter of the air brake, in order to adjust the air flow volume induced through the air brake at a given angular velocity. [0045] In some embodiments, the air brake 50 can comprise an adjustable air flow regulation mechanism, such as the inlet plate 53 or other mechanism described herein, that can be adjusted rapidly while the machine 10 is being used for exercise. For example, the air brake 50 can comprise an adjustable air flow regulation mechanism that can be rapidly adjusted by the user while the user is driving the rotation of the air brake, such as by manipulating a manual lever, a button, or other mechanism positioned within reach of the user's hands while the user is driving the pedals 32 with his feet. Such a mechanism can be mechanically and/or electrically coupled to the air flow regulation mechanism to cause an adjustment of air flow and thus adjust the resistance level. In some embodiments, such a user-caused adjustment can be automated, such as using a button on a console near the handles 34 coupled to a controller and an electrical motor coupled to the air flow regulation mechanism. In other embodiments, such an adjustment mechanism can be entirely manually operated, or a combination of manual and automated. In some embodiments, a user can cause a desired air flow regulation adjustment to be fully enacted in a relatively short time frame, such as within a half-second, within one second, within two seconds, within three second, within four seconds, and/or within five seconds from the time of manual input by the user via an electronic input device or manual actuation of a lever or other mechanical device. These exemplary time periods are for some embodiments, and in other embodiments the resistance adjustment time periods can be smaller or greater. [0046] Embodiments including a variable resistance mechanism that provide increased resistance at higher angular velocity and a rapid resistance mechanism that allow a user to quickly change the resistance at a given angular velocity, the machine 10 can be used for high intensity interval training. In an exemplary exercise method, a user can perform repeated intervals alternating between high intensity periods and low intensity periods. High intensity periods can be performed with the adjustable resistance mechanism, such as the air brake 50, set to a low resistance setting (e.g., with the inlet plate 53 blocking air flow through the air brake 50). At a low resistance setting, the user can drive the pedals 32 and/or handles 34 at a relatively high reciprocation frequency, which can cause increased energy exertion because, even though there is reduced resistance from the air brake 50, the user is caused to lift and lower his own body weight a significant distance for each reciprocation, like with a traditional stair climber machine. The rapid climbing motion can lead to an intense energy exertion. Such a high intensity period can last any length of time, such as less than one minute, or less than 30 seconds, while providing sufficient energy exertion as the user desires. Low intensity periods can be performed with the adjustable resistance mechanism, such as the air brake 50, set to a high resistance setting (e.g., with the inlet plate 53 allowing maximum air flow through the air brake 50). At a high resistance setting, the user can be restricted to driving the pedals 32 and/or handles 34 only at relatively low reciprocation frequencies, which can cause reduced energy exertion because, even though there is increased resistance from the air brake 50, the user does not have to lift and lower his own body weight as often and can therefor conserve energy. The relatively slower climbing motion can provide a rest period between high intensity periods. Such a low intensity period or rest period can last any length of time, such as less than two minutes, or less than about 90 seconds. An exemplary interval training session can comprise any number of high intensity and low intensity periods, such less than 10 of each and/or less than about 20 minutes total, while providing a total energy exertion that requires significantly longer exercise time, or is not possible, on a traditional stair climber or a traditional elliptical machine. [0047] FIGS. 8-11 show another embodiment of an exercise machine 100. The machine 100 comprises a frame 112 comprising a base 114 for contact with a support surface, a vertical brace 116 extending from the base 114 to an upper support structure 120, and first and second inclined members 122 that extend between the base 114 and the vertical brace 116. [0048] First and second crank wheels 124 are rotatably supported on opposite sides of the upper support structure 120 about a horizontal rotation axis A. First and second crank arms 128 are fixed relative to the respective crank wheels 124, positioned on outer sides of the crank wheels, and also rotatable about the rotation axis A, such that rotation of the crank arms 128 causes the crank wheels 124 to rotate. The first and second crank arms 128 extend from central ends at the axis A in opposite radial directions to respective radial ends. First and second reciprocating foot members 126 have forward ends that are pivotably coupled to the radial ends of the first and second crank arms 128, respectively, and rearward ends that are coupled to first and second foot pedals 132, respectively. First and second rollers 130 are coupled to intermediate portions of the first and second foot members 126, respectively, such that the rollers 130 can rollingly translate along the inclined members 122 of the frame 112. In alternative embodiments, other bearing mechanisms can be used to provide translational motion of the foot members 126 along the inclined members 122 instead of or in addition to the rollers 130, such as sliding friction-type bearings. [0049] When the foot pedals 132 are driven by a user, the intermediate portions of the foot members 126 translate in a substantially linear path via the rollers 130 along the inclined members 122, and the front ends of the foot members 126 move in circular paths about the rotation axis A, which drives the crank arms 128 and the crank wheels 124 in a rotational motion about axis A. The combination of the circular motion of the forward ends of the foot members 126 and the linear motion of the intermediate portions of the foot members causes the pedals 132 at the rearward ends of the foot members to move in non-circular closed loop paths, such as substantially ovular and/or substantially elliptical closed loop paths. The closed loop paths traversed by the pedals 132 can be substantially similar to those described with reference to the pedals 32 of the machine 10. A closed loop path traversed by the foot pedals 132 can have a major axis defined by the two points of the path that are furthest apart. The major axis of one or more of the closed loop paths traversed by the pedals 132 can have an angle of inclination closer to vertical than to horizontal, such as at least 45°, at least 50°, at least 55°, at least 60°, at least 65°, at least 70°, at least 75°, at least 80°, and/or at least 85°, relative to a horizontal plane defined by the base 114. To cause such inclination of the closed loop paths of the pedals 132, the inclined members 122 can comprise a substantially linear portion over which the rollers 130 traverse. The inclined members 122 form a large angle of inclination a relative to the horizontal base 114, such as at least 45°, at least 50°, at least 55°, at least 60°, at least 65°, at least 70°, at least 75°, at least 80°, and/or at least 85°. This large angle of inclination which sets the path for the foot pedal motion can provide the user with a lower body exercise more akin to climbing than to walking or running on a level surface. Such a lower body exercise can be similar to that provided by a traditional stair climbing machine. [0050] As shown in FIGS. 8-10, the machine 100 can also comprise first and second handles 134 pivotally coupled to the upper support structure 120 of the frame 112 at a horizontal axis D. Rotation of the handles 134 about the horizontal axis D causes corresponding rotation of first and second links 138, which are pivotably coupled at their radial ends to first and second reciprocating hand members 140. The lower ends of the hand members 140 comprise respective circular disks 142 that are rotatable relative to the rest of the hand member 140 about respective disk axes Β that are parallel to the crank axis A and offset radially in opposite directions from the axis A. While the structure of the hand members 140 and rotatable disks 142 are not clearly shown in FIGS. 8-11, their structures and functions should be understood to be similar to the hand members 40 and disks 42 of the machine 10, as shown in FIG. 3-7. The lower ends of the hand members 140 are positioned just inside of the crank wheels 124, as shown in FIG. 10. As the crank wheels 124 rotate about the axis A, the disk axes Β move in opposite circular orbits about the axis A of the same radius. The disks 142 are also pivotably coupled to the crank axis A, such that the disks 142 rotate within the respective lower ends of the hand members 140 as the disks 142 pivot about the crank axis A on opposite sides of the upper support member 120. The disks 142 can be fixed relative to the respective crank arms 128, such that they rotate in unison around the crank axis A to crank the crank wheel 124 when the pedals 132 and/or the handles 134 are driven by a user. The handle linkage assembly, comprising handles 134, pivot axis D, links 138, hand members 140, and disks 142, can be configured to cause the handles 134 to reciprocate in an opposite motion relative to the pedals 132. For example, as the left pedal 132 is moving upward and forward, the left handle 134 pivots rearward, and vice versa. As shown in FIG. 10, the machine 100 can further comprise a user interface 102 mounted near the top of the upper support member 120. The user interface 102 can comprise a display to provide information to the user, and can comprise user inputs to allow the user to enter information and to adjust settings of the machine, such as to adjust the resistance. The machine 100 can further comprise stationary handles 104 mounted near the top of the upper support member 120. [0051] The crank wheels 124 can be coupled to one or more resistance mechanisms to provide resistance to the reciprocation motion of the pedals 132 and handles 134. For example, the one or more resistance mechanisms can comprise an air-resistance based resistance mechanism 150, a magnetism based resistance mechanism 160, a friction based resistance mechanism, and/or other resistance mechanisms. One or more of the resistance mechanisms can be adjustable to provide different levels of resistance at a given reciprocation frequency. Further, one or more of the resistance mechanisms can provide a variable resistance that corresponds to the reciprocation frequency of the exercise machine, such that resistance increases as reciprocation frequency increases. [0052] As shown in FIGS. 8-10, the machine 100 can comprise an air-resistance based resistance mechanism, or air brake, 150 that is rotationally mounted to the frame 112 on an horizontal shaft 166, and/or a magnetism based resistance mechanism, or magnetic brake, 160, which comprises a rotor 161 rotationally mounted to the frame 112 on the same horizontal shaft 166 and brake caliper 162 also mounted to the frame 112. The air brake 150 and rotor 161 are driven by the rotation of the crank wheels 124. In the illustrated embodiment, the shaft 166 is driven by a belt or chain 148 that is coupled to a pulley 146. Pulley 146 is coupled to another pulley 125 mounted coaxially with the axis A by another belt or chain 144. The pulleys 125 and 146 can be used as a gearing mechanism to set the ratio of the angular velocity of the air brake 150 and the rotor 161 relative to the reciprocation frequency of the pedals 132 and handles 134. For example, one reciprocation of the pedals 132 can cause several rotations of the air brake 150 and rotor 161 to increase the resistance provided by the air brake 150 and/or the magnetic brake 160. [0053] The air brake 150 can be similar in structure and function to the air brake 50 of the machine 10 and can be similarly adjustable to control the volume of air flow that is induced to flow through the air brake at a given angular velocity. [0054] The magnetic brake 160 provides resistance by magnetically inducing eddy currents in the rotor 161 as the rotor rotates. As shown in FIG. 11, the brake caliper 162 comprises high power magnets 164 positioned on opposite sides of the rotor 161. As the rotor 161 rotates between the magnets 164, the magnetic fields created by the magnets induce eddy currents in the rotor, producing resistance to the rotation of the rotor. The magnitude of the resistance to rotation of the rotor can increase as a function of the angular velocity of the rotor, such that higher resistance is provided at high reciprocation frequencies of the pedals 132 and handles 134. The magnitude of resistance provided by the magnetic brake 160 can also be a function of the radial distance from the magnets 164 to the rotation axis of the shaft 166. As this radius increases, the linear velocity of the portion of the rotor 161 passing between the magnets 164 increases at any given angular velocity of the rotor, as the linear velocity at a point on the rotor is a product of the angular velocity of the rotor and the radius of that point from the rotation axis. In some embodiments, the brake caliper 162 can be pivotably mounted, or otherwise adjustable mounted, to the frame 116 such that the radial position of the magnets 134 relative to the axis of the shaft 166 can be adjusted. For example, the machine 100 can comprise a motor coupled to the brake caliper 162 that is configured to move the magnets 164 to different radial positions relative to the rotor 161. As the magnets 164 are adjusted radially inwardly, the linear velocity of the portion of the rotor 161 passing between the magnets decreases, at a given angular velocity of the rotor, thereby decreasing the resistance provided by the magnetic brake 160 at a given reciprocation frequency of the pedals 132 and handles 134. Conversely, as the magnets 164 are adjusted radially outwardly, the linear velocity of the portion of the rotor 161 passing between the magnets increases, at a given angular velocity of the rotor, thereby increasing the resistance provided by the magnetic brake 160 at a given reciprocation frequency of the pedals 132 and handles 134. [0055] In some embodiments, the brake caliper 162 can be adjusted rapidly while the machine 10 is being used for exercise to adjust the resistance. For example, the radial position of the magnets 164 of the brake caliper 162 relative to the rotor 161 can be rapidly adjusted by the user while the user is driving the reciprocation of the pedals 132 and/or handles 134, such as by manipulating a manual lever, a button, or other mechanism positioned within reach of the user's hands while the user is driving the pedals 132 with his feet. Such an adjustment mechanism can be mechanically and/or electrically coupled to the magnetic brake 160 to cause an adjustment of eddy currents in the rotor and thus adjust the magnetic resistance level. In some embodiments, such a user-caused adjustment can be automated, such as using a button on the user interface 102 that is electrically coupled to a controller and an electrical motor coupled to the brake caliper 162. In other embodiments, such an adjustment mechanism can be entirely manually operated, or a combination of manual and automated. In some embodiments, a user can cause a desired magnetic resistance adjustment to be fully enacted in a relatively short time frame, such as within a half-second, within one second, within two seconds, within three second, within four seconds, and/or within five seconds from the time of manual input by the user via an electronic input device or manual actuation of a mechanical device. In other embodiments, the magnetic resistance adjustment time periods can be smaller or greater than the exemplary time periods provided above. [0056] FIGS. 12-16 show an embodiment of the exercise machine 100 with an outer housing 170 mounted around a front portion of the machine. The housing 170 can house and protect portions of the frame 112, the pulleys 125 and 146, the belts or chains 144 and 148, lower portions of the arm members 140, the air brake 150, the magnetic brake 160, motors for adjusting the air brake and/or magnetic brake, wiring, and/or other components of the machine 100. As shown in FIGS. 12, 14, and 15 the housing 170 can comprise an air brake enclosure 172 that comprises lateral inlet openings 176 to allow air into the air brake 150 and radial outlet openings 174 to allow air out of the air brake. As shown in FIGS. 13 and 15, the housing 170 can further comprise a magnetic brake enclosure 176 to protect the magnetic brake 160, where the magnetic brake is included in addition to or instead of the air brake 150. The crank arms 128 and crank wheels 124 can be exposed through the housing such that the foot members 126 can drive them in a circular motion about the axis A without obstruction by the housing 170.
