Step 1
3-Bromo-4-(methoxymethoxy)benzaldehyde (29)
To a solution of 3-bromo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (5 g, 24.875 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (50 mL) were added DIPEA (8.8 g, 49.75 mmol) and chloro(methoxy)methane (2.8 g, 37.31 mmol) at 0° C. and stirred the resulting solution at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction mixture was poured into ice-cold water and extracted with CH2Cl2 (2×100 mL). The combined organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to give the crude product, which was purified on a silica gel column, eluting with ethyl acetate in pet-ether (0 to 20%) to get 3-bromo-4-(methoxymethoxy)benzaldehyde (3.8 g, 63%) as an off-white solid, [C9H9BrO3];
