Shelf support system Field of the Invention The present invention concerns a shelf support system. The invention also concerns a shelving unit. Background of the Invention Shelves and shelving units can be pre-built with shelves installed at fixed intervals. However, it is often desirable to be able to alter the position of shelves and as a result numerous systems exist for installing shelving support systems that can accommodate shelves at a variety of locations. However, many prior art systems are complex and are therefore relatively expensive to manufacture. A simple prior art system involves a shelf support bar which is slotted into a vertical support, with the shelf then resting on top of the bar. However, there is a possibility that the shelf support bar can fall out of the support, causing the shelf to drop. A solution is to fit a dowel into the top of the shelf support bar and to drill a corresponding hole in the bottom of the shelf so that when the shelf is in position the dowel prevents the bar from falling out. However, this solution increases the manufacturing cost and makes shelf installation more difficult because of the need to align the dowel accurately with the hole during installation. The present invention seeks to mitigate the abovementioned problems. Alternatively or additionally, the present invention seeks to provide an improved shelf support system. Summary of the Invention The present invention provides, according to a first aspect, a shelf support system comprising a, preferably vertical, shelving support rack, a shelf support bar configured to be mounted on the shelving support rack by inserting the shelf support bar horizontally into the shelving support rack, and a shelf, wherein the shelf comprises a body portion having a first thickness and an undercut end portion on the end of the body portion and having a second thickness, such that when the end portion is resting on top of the shelf support bar, the body portion prevents removal of the shelf support bar from the shelving support rack. By providing a system where the shelf itself is shaped to hold the bar in place, the need to manufacture further components is removed. Moreover the system is very easy to install because, in the absence of the shelf, the support bar and support rack can be designed so that the support bar can be straightforwardly inserted into the rack, without needing to feed it behind any stops or otherwise secure it in place. The shelf can then be simply laid on top of the support bar, without any need to precisely locate interlocking parts or put one end of the shelf in place before the other. However, despite the simplicity of installation, the installed system is secure because the weight of the shelf holds it down and the body of the shelf prevents the support bar from falling out. Preferably the top surface of the body portion and the top surface of the end portion together form a flat surface. In that way the usable top surface of the shelf extends right to the edges of the shelf. Preferably the difference between the first and second thickness is greater than the thickness of the shelf support bar. In such cases the body portion of the shelf completely masks the shelf support bar, meaning that the mounting system is not visible to someone viewing the shelf. That may be an important feature if the shelving system is to be used in a high-end shelving unit. The system of the invention combines the requirement of hiding the mounting system with the requirement to securely mount the shelf, achieving both with the same features. As a result the manufacture of the shelf is simplified. Preferably the system comprises two shelving support racks, one at each end of the shelf, wherein the system comprises two shelf support bars, one at each end of the shelf and wherein the shelf comprises the body portion and an undercut end portion at each end of the shelf. While in principle the shelf support system could be used at just one end of the shelf, with the other end supported in some other way, preferably the shelf support system is used at both ends of the shelf so that the advantages of simple manufacture and easy, but secure, installation are realised at both ends of the shelf. It will be appreciated that the shelving support racks are configured so as to support the shelf support bars vertically so that the load on the shelf is transferred, via the shelf support bars to the shelving support racks. The shelf support bars are slotted horizontally into the racks and the shelf itself prevents their horizontal removal so there is no need for the shelving support rack to provide horizontal support to prevent removal in the direction toward the shelf. The shelving support rack may provide horizontal support in the opposite direction, but if the shelving support rack is for mounting on a surface, such support may be provided by the surface on which the rack is mounted. Preferably, the shelving support rack comprises two vertical members having a plurality of notches configured to receive the shelf support bar. The notches may be simple to manufacture and the shelf support bar can be installed between any two notches that are level with each other. The shelf support bar may be from 5 to 30 mm, preferably from 15 to 25 mm, for example 20 mm, across. The shelf support bar may be from 5 to 15 mm, preferably from 8 to 12 mm, for example 10 mm, thick. The body portion of the shelf may be from 10 to 40 mm, preferably from 20 to 30 mm, thick, with the undercut, that is the difference between the first thickness and the second thickness, being from 5 to 15 mm, preferably from 8 to 12 mm, for example 10 mm. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a shelving unit comprising a shelf support system according to the first aspect of the invention. Preferably the shelving support rack is mounted on a wall of the unit such that the shelf support bar can only be horizontally inserted into the rack from the side of the rack on which the shelf is to be mounted. In that way, as described above, the wall of the unit acts to provide horizontal support to one side of the shelf support bar, while the shelving support rack provides vertical support and the body portion of the shelf provides horizontal support to the other side of the shelf support bar. Thus with a set of easily manufactured components a shelving unit can be created in which the shelves are simple to install and yet are securely held once installed. It will of course be appreciated that features described in relation to one aspect of the present invention may be incorporated into other aspects of the present invention. For example, the shelving unit of the invention may incorporate any of the features described with reference to the shelf support system of the invention and vice versa. Description of the Drawings Embodiments of the present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings of which: Figure 1 shows a front view of a shelving unit with a shelf support system according to a first embodiment of the invention; Figure 2 shows a detail of Figure 1; and Figure 3 shows a side of a shelving unit with a shelf support system according to a second embodiment of the invention. Detailed Description In Figures 1 and 2 a shelving unit 1 comprises side walls 3 and structural members 5 between the walls 3 at the top and bottom of the unit 1. The side walls incorporate vertical shelving support racks, not shown, into which shelf support bars 7 are inserted. The shelf support bars 7 extend a distance 9 of 10 mm beyond the walls 3. Shelves 11 comprise body portions 15 and undercut end portions 17. The undercut end portions 17 rest on the shelf support bars 7 and the edges of the body portions 15 lie alongside the shelf support bars 7 and prevent their removal from the shelving support rack. In Figure 3 a shelving unit 101 comprises shelving support racks 119 having a plurality of notches 123 spaced evenly along their length. Shelf support bars 107 are slotted horizontally into the notches 123 and shelves 111 rest on the shelf support bars 107. The length 125, from front to back, of the shelf support bars 107 is 405 mm and the depth 127, from front to back, of the shelves 111 is 446 mm. The undercut end portions of the shelves 111 is sized so as to fit in the gap between the shelving support racks 119. The unit 101 includes a door 121 on the front of the unit 101. In use the shelves 111 prevent the removal of the shelf support bars 107 in one horizontal direction and the walls of the unit 101 prevent removal of the shelf support bars 107 in the opposite horizontal direction. Thus the shelves 111 are securely rested on the shelf support bars 107.
