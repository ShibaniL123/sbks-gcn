The present invention relates to novel compositions for producing cast polyamides. Cast polyamides are polyamides of particularly high molecular weight. In the production of cast polyamides, a lactam is cast together with at least one catalyst and at least one activator into a mold and is then polymerized anionically in said mold. The starting compounds present in the mold here generally polymerize with exposure to heat. This process gives a homogeneous material which is superior to extruded polyamides in terms of crystallinity. Cast polyamides are suitable thermoplastics for the manufacture of complex components. Unlike many other thermoplastics, they do not have to be melted, but instead are produced through anionic polymerization of a lactam in a mold at from 120 to 160° C. at atmospheric pressure, in just a few minutes. Any of the known casting processes can be used here, for example ingot casting, rotomolding, and centrifugal casting. The final product obtained in each case comprises moldings made of a high-molecular-weight, crystalline polyamide and featuring low weight, high mechanical strength, very good slip properties, and excellent chemicals resistance, and—since materials are not charged under pressure to the molds—with only low levels of internal stress. Cast polyamides can be sawn, drilled, milled, ground, abraded, and printed or coated; this polymer is used not only for manufacture of complex hollow shapes but also by way of example for manufacture of pulleys for passenger elevators, and semifinished products such as pipes, rods, and sheets for mechanical engineering and the automobile industry. It is known per se that cast polyamide parts can be produced by what is known as activated anionic polymerization from low-viscosity lactam melts and a catalyst, and also an activator. This is usually achieved by producing, separately from one another, two mixtures of catalyst and lactam and, respectively, activator and lactam, in the form of a fresh liquid melt prior to the polymerization process, immediately mixing these with one another, and then polymerizing the mixture in the casting mold. This method is intended to ensure that no undesired premature reaction occurs. Disadvantages of the compositions known in the prior art are that these either include solid activators with low activity or include solvent-containing liquid polyisocyanates. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide compositions which do not have the disadvantages of the prior art. Surprisingly, it has now been found that compositions comprising a) at least one lactam andb) at least one activator for the anionic polymerization of lactams of the formula (I) where R1=lactam, preferably caprolactam, do not have the disadvantages of the prior art. The present invention therefore provides compositions comprising a) at least one lactam andb) at least one activator for the anionic polymerization of lactams, where the activator involves a compound of the formula (I) where R1=lactam, preferably caprolactam. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the activator involves a compound of the formula (II) The activators preferably involve compounds which are obtainable through reaction of N,N′-bis(3-isocyanato-4-methylphenyl)carbodiimide with caprolactam in the process familiar to the person skilled in the art. The production process preferably takes place in the presence of a solvent, e.g. petroleum spirit or alkylbenzenes, e.g. toluene or xylene. Compounds of the general formula (III) can be used as lactam for the purposes of the invention, where R is an alkylene group having from 3 to 13 carbon atoms. It is preferable that caprolactam and/or laurolactam is involved here. These are available commercially, e.g. from Lanxess Deutschland GmbH. The abovementioned compounds are available commercially and by way of example are obtainable from Rhein Chemie Rheinau GmbH or from Bayer MaterialScience AG. In another embodiment of the invention, the composition also comprises at least one catalyst selected from the group of lactam magnesium halide, alkali metal aluminodilactamate, alkali metal lactamate, and/or alkaline earth metal lactamate. Sodium caprolactamate is particularly preferred here. The abovementioned catalysts are available commercially and by way of example are obtainable from Rhein Chemie Rheinau GmbH or from KatChem spol.s.r.o. In another embodiment of the invention, the composition has the following proportions of a) to c): a) from 94 to 99.9% of at least one lactam,b) from 0.1 to 5%, preferably from 0.2 to 2%, particularly preferably from 0.2 to 0.8%, of at least one activator, andc) from 0 to 5% of at least one catalyst, where the entirety of the constituents is 100%. The percentage data involve % by weight. In another embodiment of the invention, the composition of the invention also comprises other additives, such as impact modifiers, e.g. polyetheramine copolymers, continuous-filament or other glass fibers, carbon fibers, aramid fibers, and/or processing aids, for example high-molecular-weight polyols, thickeners, e.g. Aerosil products, UV stabilizers and heat stabilizers, conductivity improvers, for example carbon blacks and graphites, ionic liquids, marking substances, and/or colors. The present inventions moreover provide a process for producing cast polyamides which constituents a) and b) and optionally c) of the composition of the invention in the form of melt are polymerized at temperatures of from 80 to 160° C. In the cases where the composition of the invention also comprises other additives, these can be added prior to and/or during the polymerization process. The amount of additives is determined by the intended use and can therefore be varied as desired. Polymerization is achieved by the processes familiar to the person skilled in the art, for example as described in Kunststoffhandbuch [Plastics Handbook], vol. 3/4, Technische Thermoplaste [Engineering Thermoplastics], Hanser Fachbuch, pp. 413-430. The mixture here is preferably stirred. Mixing assemblies can be used for this purpose, examples being stirred tanks. The present invention further provides the use of the composition of the invention for producing cast polyamides. The abovementioned compositions of the invention are preferably used as replacement for metal, e.g. in the automobile industry, in the production of electrical-engineering parts, and for electronic applications, for the production of sheets, bars, pipes, cable pulleys, gearwheels, and bearings, and/or for the manufacture of containers. The scope of the invention encompasses, in combination with one another, all of the moiety definitions, indices, parameters, and explanations mentioned above and listed hereinafter or mentioned in preferred ranges, i.e. also encompasses any desired combination involving the respective ranges and preferred ranges. The examples below serve for explanation of the invention, without any resultant limiting effect. INVENTIVE EXAMPLES Reagents Anhydrous caprolactam (FP>69° C.) from Lanxess Deutschland GmbH.
