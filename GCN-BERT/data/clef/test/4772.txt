Proton Pump Inhibitor Paste Compositions Technical Field The present invention relates to novel paste compositions containing a proton pump inhibitor, pharmaceutical formulations comprising said paste compositions and their use for inhibiting gastric acid secretion in mammals. Background Art Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion by inhibiting H+K+ -ATPase, the enzyme involved in the final step of hydrogen ion production in the parietal cells. Several PPI, such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole and leminoprazole, and their processes of making have been described in the art. See ΕΡ005129, ΕΡ174726, ΕΡ166287 and GB2163747. A number of pharmaceutical formulations containing PPI have also been disclosed. See ΕΡ247903. Some PPI formulations have been proposed for veterinary use. For instance, an oral composition containing a PPI in the form of enteric coated dry particles mixed with a dry gelling agent is described in ΕΡ0696921. These enteric formulations are regrettably difficult to administer and expensive to produce. Another example of a PPI formulation is reported in US5708017, which discloses an oral omeprazole paste suitable for veterinary application. However, this paste composition is unstable unless a thickening agent is present. Summary of the Invention The present invention discloses paste compositions comprising a proton pump inhibitor, a basifying agent and a mineral oil-based vehicle useful for the treatment and prevention of diseases and conditions related to gastric acid secretion abnormalities. Surprisingly, the paste compositions thus formulated do not require the addition of a thickening agent, as is the standard practice in the art, in order to be stable. The elimination of the thickening agent has also the advantage of facilitating the process of making said compositions and reducing their production costs. Moreover, the present invention shows that the combination of the basifying agent and mineral oil-based vehicle has a synergistic effect that yields more stable PPI compositions. The compositions of the invention are stable after three years of storage, while comparable products have only a maximum shelf life of two years. An additional benefit of the compositions of the invention is that a lower amount of the basifying agent is required to attain a stability level comparable to other PPI paste compositions known in the art. In circumstances where large concentrations of the basifying agent could be undesirable, this particular feature of the invention minimizes any unwanted effects and improves the overall safety profile of the paste composition. In a first aspect, the present invention is directed to a stable paste composition comprising: i) a proton pump inhibitor, ii) a basifying agent and iii) a mineral oil-based vehicle having density of about 0.769 g/mL to about 0.915 g/mL at 15°C as measured by ASTM D-1298, or a kinematic viscosity of about 10.5 mm2/s to about 90 mm2/s at 40°C as measured by ASTM D-445. Desirably, the paste compositions of the present invention do not contain a thickening agent. Advantageously, the paste compositions of the present invention are stable in the absence of a thickening agent. For example, the paste composition of the invention may consist essentially of: i) a proton pump inhibitor, ii) a basifying agent and iii) a mineral oil-based vehicle having density of about 0.769 g/mL to about 0.915 g/mL at 15°C as measured by ASTM D-1298, or a kinematic viscosity of about 10.5 mm2/s to about 90 mm2/s at 40°C as measured by ASTM D-445. In a second aspect, the present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of the paste composition of the invention, which comprises mixing a PPI, a basifying agent and the mineral oil-based vehicle. In a third aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the paste composition according to the first aspect of the invention and at least one excipient. In a fourth aspect, the present invention refers to a paste composition according to the first aspect of the invention or a pharmaceutical formulation according to the third aspect of the invention for its use as a medicament.

Examples of basic salts include, but are not limited to, the calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium salts of the compounds of the present invention. The PPI of the invention shall be interpreted to include also certain of their forms or variations. Said compounds may have asymmetric centers and, therefore, exist in different enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms. Thus, any given compound referred to herein is intended to represent any one of a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one or more diastereomeric forms or a combination thereof. Likewise, stereoisomerism or geometric isomerism about the double bond is also possible, therefore in some cases the molecule could exist as cis or trans isomers. If the molecule contains several double bonds, each double bond will have its own stereoisomerism, that could be the same as, or different to, the stereoisomerism of the other double bonds of the molecule. Furthermore, the PPI of the invention may exist as atropisomers. All the stereoisomers of the PPI of the invention, including their enantiomers, diastereoisomers, geometric isomers, atropisomers and the combinations thereof, are considered within the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, the PPI of the invention may exist as tautomers. Specifically, the term tautomer refers to one of two or more structural isomers of a compound that exist in equilibrium and are readily converted from one isomeric form to another. Common tautomeric pairs include, but are not limited to, amine-imine, amide-imidic acid, keto-enol, and lactam-lactim. 3. Process of making paste composition In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a process of preparing the paste composition of the invention, which comprises mixing a PPI, a basifying agent and a mineral oil-based vehicle. 4. Pharmaceutical formulations In another aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the paste composition of the invention and at least one excipient. Preferably, the pharmaceutical formulation is suitable for oral administration such as an oral solution, oral suspension, feed premix, gels, capsule or bolus. The formulations of the invention may be produced following methods known in the art. See Gunnar A, Ed., “Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy” 20th ed. (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA, US, 2003). Other suitable excipients for the stabilization of PPI include, in particular, buffers with a pH value of 6 or higher, preferably between pH 8 and 11, such as buffer mixtures comprising sodium phosphate, sodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate and sodium hydroxide or a combination thereof. 5. Use of paste composition and formulation for the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions In another aspect, the present invention refers to the use of a paste composition according to the invention or a pharmaceutical formulation containing said paste for inhibiting gastric acid secretion, including the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions due to an increased gastric acid secretion. In a particular embodiment, the disease or condition is gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastric and duodenum ulceration or gastritis. Alternatively, the present invention refers to a method of inhibiting gastric secretion in a subject which comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective dose of a paste composition or pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention. Preferably, the subject is a human being or a horse. More preferably, the subject is a horse. Preferably, the paste composition or formulation of the invention is administered periodically, such as on a daily basis. However, a single treatment or administration of the paste composition or formulation over one or two days (e.g. once daily for one or two days), such as prior to or during a stressful event, is also contemplated. The effective amount of the PPI administered should be about 0.1 to about 8 mg per kg body weight. Preferably, the PPI is administered in relatively low doses. In addition, the paste may be administered in the form of a formulation for controlled release and long lasting delivery, in which case the administration can be less frequent (e.g. weekly, monthly). The dosage regimen may vary with time depending on the therapeutic objective sought. For instance, for the treatment of gastric ulcers, a relatively high dose of 4 to 5 mg PPI per kg body weight per day may be used at the beginning of treatment followed by a lower dosage regimen of 1 mg PPI per kg body weight per day after the subject has been stabilized. On the other hand, a basal dosage regime of 1 mg PPI per kg body weight per day may suffice to prevent the occurrence or recurrence of gastric ulcers. The duration of the administration for preventing ulcers may last several days. Preferably, the administration is continuous, either for life or at least during the whole period where the subject is or is suspected to be under stress conditions or other conditions which may increase the risk of formation of ulcers. Preferably, the paste composition or formulation is administered to a subject having a substantial risk of developing gastrointestinal ulcers. For instance, the administration to horses is preferably conducted during periods of stress, training, transportation, change in environment (e.g. weather changes, housing changes) or pregnancy. According to the invention, the paste composition can be administered under any suitable formulation for delivery, preferably, for oral delivery. Preferably, the paste composition is administered directly as an oral pharmaceutical formulation. This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all documents cited throughout this application are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. Examples 1, 2 and 3 Stable omeprazole paste compositions First, yellow iron oxide was added to liquid paraffin and mixed slowly for 15 minutes or until a uniform dispersion was obtained. Then, monoethanolamine and cinnamon leaf oil were added to the blend and mixed slowly for 10 minutes until uniformly dispersed. Omeprazole was incorporated to the blend in small amounts and mixed at low speed until a smooth and uniform paste was obtained. Compositions containing 37%, 38% and 39% w/w omeprazole were prepared adjusting the liquid paraffin content accordingly. See Table 2. All compositions were stable after 36 months at 25°C and 60% relative humidity.

The compositions were stored at 25°C and 60% relative humidity. Their stabilities were assayed after 3 months. See Table 3. Table 3 Assays Ingredients 1 (w/w) 2 (w/w) 3 (w/w) 4 (w/w) 5 (w/w) 6 (w/w) Omeprazole 37% 37% 37% 37% 37% 37% Monoethanolamine 0.1% 0.02% 0.05% 0.1% 0.05% 0.05% Polyethylene glycol 62.9 % 42.98 % Neobee oil 62.95 % Castor oil, hydrogenated 20% 1.25% Soybean oil 61.65% 62.95 % Liquid paraffin 62.95% Condition Unstable Unstable Unstable Stable Unstable Stable The data above shows that, in the absence of a thickening agent, PPI paste compositions based on vegetable oils or polymeric glycol vehicles are unstable, vide supra assays 1-3, and 5 versus assay 4. However, when a mineral oil vehicle is employed instead, the resulting paste composition is stable without requiring the addition of any thickening agent, vide supra assay 6. This last approach also produces a paste composition with a longer shelf life. Moreover, the use of a mineral oil vehicle to prepare PPI paste compositions makes possible reducing the weight content of any basifying agents present in the mixture. For instance, a minimum content of 0.1% w/w of the basifying agent monoethanolamine is required to maintain the stability of an omeprazole paste composition when a vegetable oil or polymer vehicle is used. However, when liquid paraffin is incorporated to the paste, the monoethanolamine content may be reduced 50% and still yield a stable omeprazole composition. 1.
