Step 6: 1-((R)-1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-6-(3-methyl-4-oxocyclohex-1-en-1-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine-3-carbonitrile
The first pair of diastereomers isolated from Example 69, Step 5, 1-((R)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-6-(6-methyl-1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]dec-7-en-8-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine-3-carbonitrile (500 mg, 1.01 mmol) was diluted with dichloromethane (8 mL) and trifluoroacetic acid (1.6 mL). The resulting clear, red solution was stirred at room temperature for 20 h. The reaction was then carefully basified with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and extracted with dichloromethane (3Ã—). The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to afford the title compound as a mixture of diastereomers (250 mg, 77% yield).
