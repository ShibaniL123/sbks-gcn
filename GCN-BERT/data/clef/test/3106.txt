The present invention relates to 1,4-ethynylbenzene derivatives having substituents in the 2,3-position of the benzene ring (cf. formula I, Claims), to the use thereof for high-frequency components, to liquid-crystalline media comprising the compounds, and to high-frequency components, in particular antennae, especially for the gigahertz range, comprising these media. The liquid-crystalline media serve, for example, for the phase shifting of microwaves for tuneable “phased-array” antennae. Liquid-crystalline media have been used for some time in electro-optical displays (liquid crystal displays—LCDs) in order to display information. 1,4-Diethynylbenzene derivatives are proposed as liquid-crystalline components in the specifications EP 0968988 A1, DE 19907941 A1, DE 10120024 A1 and JP 08012599 A. However, the specific substitution therein does not correspond to the substitution pattern of the compounds reproduced in the context of this invention. However, liquid-crystalline media have recently also been proposed for use in components for microwave technology, such as, for example, in DE 10 2004 029 429 A and in JP 2005-120208 (A). An industrially valuable application of liquid-crystalline media in high-frequency technology is based on their property that their dielectric properties can be controlled by a variable voltage, particularly for the gigahertz range. Thus, tuneable antennae can be designed which contain no moving parts (A. Gaebler, A. Moessinger, F. Goelden, et al., “Liquid Crystal-Reconfigurable Antenna Concepts for Space Applications at Microwave and Millimeter Waves”, International Journal of Antennas and Propagation, vol. 2009, Article ID 876989, 7 pages, 2009. doi:10.1155/2009/876989). The publication A. Penirschke, S. Müller, P. Scheele, C. Weil, M. Wittek, C. Hock and R. Jakoby: “Cavity Perturbation Method for Characterization of Liquid Crystals up to 35 GHz”, 34th European Microwave Conference—Amsterdam, 545-548, describes, inter alia, the properties of the known, liquid-crystalline single substance K15 (Merck KGaA, Germany) at a frequency of 9 GHz. 1-(Phenylethynyl)tolans, also called bistolan compounds below, having an alkyl substitution on the central phenylene ring are known to the person skilled in the art. For example, the publication S.-T. Wu, C.-S. Hsu, K.-F. Shyu Appl. Phys. Lett. (1999), 74 (3), 344-346, discloses various liquid-crystalline bistolan compounds having a lateral methyl group, of the formula Besides liquid-crystalline bistolan compounds of this type having a lateral methyl group, C. S. Hsu, K. F. Shyu, Y. Y. Chuang, S.-T. Wu Liq. Cryst. (2000), 27 (2), 283-287, also discloses corresponding compounds having a lateral ethyl group and proposes the use thereof, inter alia, in “liquid crystal optically phased arrays”. DE 10 2004 029 429 A (cf. above) describes the use of conventional liquid-crystal media in microwave technology, inter alia in phase shifters. Liquid-crystalline media have already been investigated therein with respect to their properties in the corresponding frequency range. However, the compositions or individual compounds known to date are generally afflicted with disadvantages. Most of them result, besides other deficiencies, in disadvantageously high losses and/or inadequate phase shifts or inadequate material quality. For use in high-frequency technology, liquid-crystalline media having particular, hitherto rather unusual, non-standard properties, or combinations of properties, are required. Thus, novel components for liquid-crystalline media having improved properties are necessary. In particular, the loss in the microwave range must be reduced and the material quality (η) must be improved. For tuneable antennae, liquid-crystalline media having a fast reaction time to a change in the voltage between the electrodes of the cell are also required. In addition, there is a need to improve the low-temperature behaviour of the components. Both an improvement in the operating properties and also in the shelf life is necessary here. There is therefore a considerable demand for liquid-crystalline media having suitable properties for corresponding practical applications. Surprisingly, it has been found that the compounds according to the invention having two substituents in the ortho position on one aromatic ring have a significantly higher clearing point (transition from the nematic phase into the isotropic phase) compared with a corresponding monosubstituted compound or a disubstituted compound in which the substituents are not arranged in the ortho position to one another. At the same time, the rotational viscosity (γ1) is significantly lower than in the comparative compounds having fewer substituents or without substituents in the ortho position. This effect arises in compounds in which the ring systems are kept at distance by rigid ethynylene bridges. Utilising this effect, it has now been found, surprisingly, that liquid-crystalline media having a suitable, nematic phase range and high Δn which do not have the disadvantages of the materials of the prior art or at least only do so to a considerably reduced extent can be achieved with the compounds according to the invention.

Fast response times are achieved by a surprisingly low rotational viscosity γ1. A phase shifter can thus adjust faster. The relatively low loss factor in the microwave spectrum is also advantageous. The compounds, alone or in a mixture with further mesogenic components, have a nematic phase over a broad temperature range. These properties make them particularly suitable for use in components for high-frequency technology, in particular in liquid-crystalline phase shifters. Liquid-crystalline media according to the invention have the corresponding properties, for example a broad phase range, fast response time, and in addition good low-temperature stability. Preferred compounds of the formula I are characterised by the choice of one or more of the following parameters: The index n is preferably 1 or 2, particularly preferably 1. The ring groups A11 and A12 are on each occurrence, independently of one another, preferably a 1,4-phenylene, in which, in addition, one or more H atoms may be replaced by Br, Cl, F, CN, alkyl (C1-C10), methoxy or a mono- or polyfluorinated methyl or methoxy group.

The liquid-crystalline media in accordance with the present invention preferably comprise, more preferably predominantly consist of, even more preferably essentially consist of and very preferably completely consist of compounds selected from the group of the compounds of the formulae I and II. In this application, “comprise” in connection with compositions means that the entity in question, i.e. the medium or the component, comprises the component or components or compound or compounds indicated, preferably in a total concentration of 10% or more and very preferably 20% more. In this connection, “predominantly consist of” means that the entity in question comprises 55% or more, preferably 60% or more and very preferably 70% or more, of the component or components or compound or compounds indicated. In this connection, “essentially consist of” means that the entity in question comprises 80% or more, preferably 90% or more and very preferably 95% or more, of the component or components or compound or compounds indicated. In this connection, “completely consist of” means that the entity in question comprises 98% or more, preferably 99% or more and very preferably 100.0%, of the component or components or compound or compounds indicated. The liquid-crystalline media in accordance with the present application preferably comprise in total 10 to 100%, preferably 20 to 95% and particularly preferably 25 to 90%, of compounds of the formulae I and II. In accordance with the present invention, the compounds of the formula II are preferably used in a total concentration of 10% to 90%, more preferably 15% to 85%, even more preferably 25% to 80% and very preferably 30% to 75%, of the mixture as a whole. In addition, the liquid-crystalline media may comprise further additives, such as stabilisers, chiral dopants and nanoparticles. The individual compounds added are employed in concentrations of 0.005 to 6%, preferably 0.1 to 3%. The total concentration of these further constituents is in the range from 0% to 10%, preferably 0.1% to 6%, based on the mixture as a whole. However, the concentration data for the remaining constituents of the liquid-crystal mixtures, i.e. the liquid-crystalline or mesogenic compounds, are indicated without taking into account the concentration of these additives.

The media preferably comprise one or more stabilisers selected from 2,6-di-tert-butylphenols, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidines or 2-benzotriazol-2-ylphenols. These assistants are known to the person skilled in the art and are commercially available, for example as light stabilisers. An embodiment of the invention is therefore also a process for the preparation ration of a liquid-crystal medium which is characterised in that one or more compounds of the formula I are mixed with one or more further compounds and optionally with one or more additives. The further compounds are preferably selected from the compounds of the formula II, as indicated above, and optionally one or more further compounds. In the present application, the expression dielectrically positive describes compounds or components where Δ∈>3.0, dielectrically neutral describes those where −1.5≦Δ∈≦3.0 and dielectrically negative describes those where Δ∈<−1.5. The dielectric anisotropy of the respective compound is determined from the results of a solution of 10% of the respective individual compound in a nematic host mixture. If the solubility of the respective compound in the host mixture is less than 10%, the concentration is reduced to 5%. The capacitances of the test mixtures are determined both in a cell having homeotropic alignment and in a cell having homogeneous alignment. The cell thickness of both types of cells is approximately 20 μm. The voltage applied is a rectangular wave having a frequency of 1 kHz and an effective value of typically 0.5 V to 1.0 V, but it is always selected to be below the capacitive threshold of the respective test mixture. Δ∈ is defined as (∈∥−∈⊥), whereas ∈average is (∈∥+2∈⊥)/3. The host mixture used for dielectrically positive compounds is mixture ZLI-4792 and that used for dielectrically neutral and dielectrically negative compounds is mixture ZLI-3086, both from Merck KGaA, Germany. The absolute values of the dielectric constants of the compounds are determined from the change in the respective values of the host mixture on addition of the compounds of interest. The values are extrapolated to a concentration of the compounds of interest of 100%. Components having a nematic phase at the measurement temperature of 20° C. are measured as such, all others are treated like compounds. The term threshold voltage in the present application refers to the optical threshold and is quoted for 10% relative contrast (V10), and the term saturation voltage refers to the optical saturation and is quoted for 90% relative contrast (V90), in both cases unless expressly stated otherwise. The capacitive threshold voltage (V0), also called the Freedericks threshold (VFr), is only used if expressly mentioned. The parameter ranges indicated in this application all include the limit values, unless expressly stated otherwise. The different upper and lower limit values indicated for various ranges of properties in combination with one another give rise to additional preferred ranges. Throughout this application, the following conditions and definitions apply, unless expressly stated otherwise. All concentrations are quoted in percent by weight and relate to the respective mixture as a whole, all temperatures are quoted in degrees Celsius and all temperature differences are quoted in differential degrees. All physical properties that are typical for liquid crystals are determined in accordance with “Merck Liquid Crystals, Physical Properties of Liquid Crystals”, Status November 1997, Merck KGaA, Germany, and are quoted for a temperature of 20° C., unless expressly stated otherwise. The optical anisotropy (Δn) is determined at a wavelength of 589.3 nm. The dielectric anisotropy (Δ∈) is determined at a frequency of 1 kHz. The threshold voltages, as well as all other electro-optical properties, are determined using test cells produced at Merck KGaA, Germany. The test cells for the determination of Δ∈ have a cell thickness of approximately 20 μm. The electrode is a circular ITO electrode having an area of 1.13 cm2 and a guard ring. The orientation layers are SE-1211 from Nissan Chemicals, Japan, for homeotropic orientation (∈∥) and polyimide AL-1054 from Japan Synthetic Rubber, Japan, for homogeneous orientation (∈195 ). The capacitances are determined using a Solatron 1260 frequency response analyser using a sine wave with a voltage of 0.3 Vrms. The light used in the electro-optical measurements is white light. A set-up using a commercially available DMS instrument from Autronic-Melchers, Germany, is used here. The characteristic voltages are determined under perpendicular observation. The threshold (V10), mid-grey (V50) and saturation (V90) voltages are determined for 10%, 50% and 90% relative contrast, respectively. The liquid-crystalline media are investigated with respect to their properties in the microwave frequency range as described in A. Penirschke et al. “Cavity Perturbation Method for Characterization of Liquid Crystals up to 35 GHz”, 34th European Microwave Conference—Amsterdam, pp. 545-548. Compare in this respect also A. Gaebler et al. “Direct Simulation of Material Permittivities . . . ”, 12MTC 2009—International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference, Singapore, 2009 (IEEE), pp. 463-467, and DE 10 2004 029 429 A, in which a measurement method is likewise described in detail. The liquid crystal is introduced into a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or quartz capillary. The capillary has an internal radius of 180 μm and an external radius of 350 μm. The effective length is 2.0 cm. The filled capillary is introduced into the centre of the cavity with a resonance frequency of 30 GHz. This cavity has a length of 6.6 mm, a width of 7.1 mm and a height of 3.6 mm. The input signal (source) is then applied, and the result of the output signal is recorded using a commercial vector network analyser. For other frequencies (e.g. 19 GHz), the dimensions of the cavity are adapted correspondingly. The change in the resonance frequency and the Q factor between the measurement with the capillary filled with the liquid crystal and the measurement without the capillary filled with the liquid crystal is used to determine the dielectric constant and the loss angle at the corresponding target frequency by means of equations 10 and 11 in the above-mentioned publication A. Penirschke et al., 34th European Microwave Conference—Amsterdam, pp. 545-548, as described therein. The values for the components of the properties perpendicular and parallel to the director of the liquid crystal are obtained by alignment of the liquid crystal in a magnetic field. To this end, the magnetic field of a permanent magnet is used. The strength of the magnetic field is 0.35 tesla. The alignment of the magnet is set correspondingly and then rotated correspondingly through 90°. The dielectric anisotropy in the microwave range is defined as [in-line-formulae](Δ∈r≡(∈r,∥−∈r,⊥).[/in-line-formulae] The modulatability or tuneability (τ) is defined as [in-line-formulae]τ≡(Δ∈r/∈r,∥).[/in-line-formulae] The material quality (TO is defined as [in-line-formulae]η≡(τ/tan δ∈r,max.),[/in-line-formulae] with the maximum dielectric loss factor tan δ∈r,max.: [in-line-formulae]tan δ∈r,max.≡max.{tan δ∈r,⊥;tan δ∈r,∥}[/in-line-formulae] which arises from the maximum value of the measured values for tan δ∈r. The material quality (η) of the preferred liquid-crystal materials is 5 or more, preferably 6 or more, preferably 8 or more, preferably 10 or more, preferably 15 or more, preferably 17 or more, particularly preferably 20 or more and very particularly preferably 25 or more. In the corresponding components, the preferred liquid-crystal materials have phase shifter qualities of 15°/dB or more, preferably 20°/dB or more, preferably 30°/dB or more, preferably 40°/dB or more, preferably 50°/dB or more, particularly preferably 80°/dB or more and very particularly preferably 100°/dB or more. The liquid-crystal media according to the invention preferably have nematic phases of in each case at least from −20° C. to 80° C., preferably from −30° C. to 85° C. and very particularly preferably from −40° C. to 100° C. The phase particularly preferably extends to 120° C. or more, preferably to 140° C. or more and very particularly preferably to 180° C. or more. The expression have a nematic phase here means on the one hand that no smectic phase and no crystallisation are observed at low temperatures at the corresponding temperature and on the other hand that no clearing occurs on heating from the nematic phase. The investigation at low temperatures is carried out in a flow viscometer at the corresponding temperature and checked by storage in test cells having a cell thickness of 5 μm for at least 100 hours. At high temperatures, the clearing point is measured in capillaries by conventional methods. The liquid-crystal media in accordance with the present invention preferably have a clearing point of 90° C. or more, more preferably 100° C. or more, even more preferably 120° C. or more, particularly preferably 150° C. or more and very particularly preferably 170° C. or more. The Δ∈ of the liquid-crystal medium in accordance with the invention, at 1 kHz and 20° C., is preferably 1 or more, more preferably 2 or more and very preferably 3 or more. The Δn of the liquid-crystal media in accordance with the present invention, at 589 nm (NaD) and 20° C., is preferably in the range from 0.20 or more to 0.90 or less, more preferably in the range from 0.25 or more to 0.90 or less, even more preferably in the range from 0.30 or more to 0.85 or less and very particularly preferably in the range from 0.35 or more to 0.80 or less. In a preferred embodiment of the present application, the Δn of the liquid-crystal media in accordance with the present invention is preferably 0.50 or more, more preferably 0.55 or more. Furthermore, the liquid-crystal media according to the invention are characterised by high anisotropies in the microwave range. The birefringence is, for example, preferably 0.14 or more, particularly preferably 0.15 or more, particularly preferably 0.20 or more, particularly preferably 0.25 or more and very particularly preferably 0.30 or more, at about 8.3 GHz. In addition, the birefringence is preferably 0.80 or less. The liquid crystals employed are either individual substances or mixtures. They preferably have a nematic phase. In the present application, the term compounds means both one compound and a plurality of compounds, unless expressly stated otherwise. Preferred components which comprise a liquid-crystal medium or at least one compound in accordance with the invention are phase shifters, varactors, antenna arrays (for example for radio, mobile communications, microwave/radar and other data transmission), ‘matching circuit adaptive filters’ and others. Preference is given to components for high-frequency technology, as defined above. Preference is also given to components which can be modulated by different applied electrical voltages. Very particularly preferred components are phase shifters. In preferred embodiments, a plurality of phase shifters are functionally connected, giving, for example, a phase-controlled group antenna, generally referred to as a “phased array” antenna. A group antenna uses the phase shift of the transmitting or receiving elements arranged in a matrix in order to achieve bundling through interference. A parallel arrangement of phase shifters in row or grid form enables the construction of a so-called ‘phased array’, which can serve as tuneable transmitting or receiving antenna for high frequencies (for example gigahertz range). “Phased array” antennae according to the invention have a very broad usable reception cone. Preferred applications are radar installations and data transmission equipment on manned or unmanned vehicles from the automobile, shipping, aircraft, space travel and satellite technology areas. For the production of suitable components, in particular phase shifters, a liquid-crystalline medium according to the invention is typically introduced into rectangular cavities having a thickness of less than 1 mm, a width of several mm and a length of several centimetres. The cavities have opposing electrodes mounted along two long sides. Such arrangements are familiar to the person skilled in the art. Through application of a variable voltage, the dielectric properties of the liquid-crystalline medium can be tuned during operation of the antenna in order to set different frequencies or directions of an antenna. The term “halogen” or “halogenated” stands for F, Cl, Br and I, particularly for F and Cl and in particular for F. The term “alkyl” preferably encompasses straight-chain and branched alkyl groups having 1 to 15 carbon atoms, in particular the straight-chain groups methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl and heptyl. Groups having 2 to 10 carbon atoms are generally preferred. The term “alkenyl” preferably encompasses straight-chain and branched alkenyl groups having 2 to 15 carbon atoms, in particular the straight-chain groups. Particularly preferred alkenyl groups are C2- to C7-1E-alkenyl, C4- to C7-3E-alkenyl, C5- to C7-4-alkenyl, C6- to C7-5-alkenyl and C7-6-alkenyl, in particular C2- to C7-1E-alkenyl, C4- to C7-3E-alkenyl and C5- to C7-4-alkenyl. Examples of further preferred alkenyl groups are vinyl, 1 E-propenyl, 1 E-butenyl, 1 E-pentenyl, 1 E-hexenyl, 1 E-heptenyl, 3-butenyl, 3E-pentenyl, 3E-hexenyl, 3E-heptenyl, 4-pentenyl, 4Z-hexenyl, 4E-hexenyl, 4Z-heptenyl, 5-hexenyl, 6-heptenyl and the like. Groups having up to 5 carbon atoms are generally preferred. The term “alkoxy” preferably encompasses straight-chain radicals of the formula CnH2n+1—O—, in which n denotes 1 to 10. n is preferably 1 to 6. Preferred alkoxy groups are, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, n-butoxy, n-pentoxy, n-hexoxy, n-heptoxy, n-octoxy, n-nonoxy, n-decoxy. The term “oxaalkyl” or “alkoxyalkyl” preferably encompasses straight-chain radicals of the formula CnH2n+1—O—(CH2)m, in which n and m each, independently of one another, denote 1 to 10. Preferably, n is 1 and m is 1 to 6. The term “fluorinated alkyl radical” preferably encompasses mono- or polyfluorinated radicals. Perfluorinated radicals are included. Particular preference is given to CF3, CH2CF3, CH2CHF2, CHF2, CH2F, CHFCF3 and CF2CHFCF3. The term “fluorinated alkoxy radical” encompasses mono- or polyfluorinated radicals. Perfluorinated radicals are preferred. Particular preference is given to the OCF3 radical. The term “substituted cycloalkyl” encompasses cycloalkyl which is mono- or polysubstituted by alkyl, in particular alkyl having 1 to 8 carbon atoms. The term “substituted phenyl” encompasses phenyl which is mono- or polysubstituted by a group defined like R1, in particular phenyl which is substituted by F, Cl, alkyl or alkoxy. In the present application, high-frequency technology means applications having frequencies in the range from 1 MHz to 10 THz, preferably from 1 GHz to 3 THz, more preferably from 2 GHz to 1 THz, particularly preferably from 5 to 300 GHz. The application is preferably in the microwave spectrum or adjacent regions which are suitable for message transmission, in which “phased array” modules can be used in transmitting or receiving antennae. The liquid-crystal media according to the invention consist of one or more compounds, preferably 2 to 30, more preferably 3 to 20 and very preferably 3 to 16, compounds. These compounds are mixed in a conventional manner. In general, the desired amount of the compound used in the smaller amount is dissolved in the compound used in the larger amount. If the temperature is above the clearing point of the compound used in the higher concentration, it is particularly easy to observe completion of the dissolution process. It is, however, also possible to prepare the media in other conventional ways, for example using so-called pre-mixes, which can be, for example, homologous or eutectic mixtures of compounds, or using so-called “multibottle” systems, the constituents of which are themselves ready-to-use mixtures. All temperatures, such as, for example, the melting point T(C,N) or T(C,S), the transition from the smectic (S) to the nematic (N) phase T(S,N) and the clearing point T(N,I) of the liquid crystals, are quoted in degrees Celsius. All temperature differences are quoted in differential degrees. In the present application and in the following examples, the structures of the liquid-crystal compounds are indicated by means of acronyms, where the transformation into chemical formulae is carried out in accordance with Tables A and B below. All radicals CnH2n+1 and CmH2m+1 are straight-chain alkyl radicals having n and m C atoms respectively; n, m and k are integers and preferably denote 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12. The coding in Table B is self-evident. In Table A, only the acronym for the parent structure is indicated. In individual cases, the acronym for the parent structure is followed, separated by a dash, by a code for the substituents R1*, R2*, L1* and L2*: Code for R1*, R2*, L1*, L2*, L3* R1* R2* L1* L2* nm CnH2n+1 CmH2m+1 H H nOm CnH2n+1 OCmH2m+1 H H nO.m OCnH2n+1 CmH2m+1 H H n CnH2n+1 CN H H nN.F CnH2n+1 CN F H nN.F.F CnH2n+1 CN F F nF CnH2n+1 F H H nCl CnH2n+1 Cl H H nOF OCnH2n+1 F H H nF.F CnH2n+1 F F H nF.F.F CnH2n+1 F F F nOCF3 CnH2n+1 OCF3 H H nOCF3.F CnH2n+1 OCF3 F H n-Vm CnH2n+1 —CH═CH—CmH2m+1 H H nV-Vm CnH2n+1—CH═CH— —CH═CH—CmH2m+1 H H Suitable mixture components are given in Tables A and B.

The reaction mixture is then allowed to warm to ambient temperature, and the batch is hydrolyzed using water, acidified using 25% HCl and subjected to extractive work-up. The crude product is purified by fractional distillation, giving 70 g of a colorless liquid having a boiling point of 125° C. at 0.2 bar. Step 1.2 5 g of 4-(4-butylphenylethynyl)ethynylbenzene are initially introduced in 50 ml of THF and cooled to −78° C. 20 ml of a 1 M solution of lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in hexane are added drop wise to this solution, and the mixture is allowed to react for at −78° C. 1 h. 20 ml of a 1M solution of methoxy-9-BBN are then added drop wise, and the mixture is stirred at −78° C. for 2 h. 4.6 g of 1-bromo-2-ethyl-3,4,5-trifluorobenzene, dissolved in 40 ml of THF, are initially introduced in a second apparatus with the catalyst made from 0.2 g of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium and 0.35 g of 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2′,6′-dimethoxybiphenyl, and the reaction solution from the first reaction is added thereto at room temperature. The mixture is heated under reflux for 15 h. The batch is hydrolyzed using water and subjected to extractive work-up. The crude product is purified by chromatography (pentane/silica gel). Recrystallisation from pentane gives 3.6 g of the title product. Phase sequence: C 84 N 85.1 I. Data extrapolated from 10% solution in ZLI-4792: T(N,I)=108° C., Δ∈=+18.4; Δn=0.326 and γ1=603 mPa·s.
