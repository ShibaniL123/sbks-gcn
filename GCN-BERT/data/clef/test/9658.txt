No. 12/886,680, filed Sep. 21, 2010, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,288,592, which claims the benefit of priority to Indian provisional application No. 2287/CHE/2009, filed on Sep. 22, 2009, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel solid state forms of tapentadol salts, a process for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of treating thereof. BACKGROUND U.S. Reissue Patent No. USRE39593 discloses a variety of 1-phenyl-3-dimethylaminopropane compounds, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, and method of use thereof. These compounds have the utility as analgesic active ingredients in pharmaceutical compositions. Among them, tapentadol hydrochloride, 3-[(1R,2R)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-ethyl-2-methylpropyl]phenol hydrochloride, is a centrally-acting analgesic with a unique dual mode of action as an agonist at the μ-opioid receptor and as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Tapentadol hydrochloride is represented by the following structural formula: Various processes for the preparation of tapentadol, its enantiomers and related compounds, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,248,737 and 6,344,558; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 2004/108658, WO 2005/000788, WO 2008/012046, WO 2008/012047 and WO 2008/012283. U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,737 (herein after referred to as the '737 patent) discloses processes for the preparation of tapentadol or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. While the '737 patent mentions that some of the disclosed compounds can form salts with physiologically acceptable acids, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, citric acid, glutamic acid and/or aspartic acid, only the hydrochloride salt had been prepared and isolated. According to the '737 patent, tapentadol is prepared by the reaction of (−)-(2S,3S)-1-dimethylamino-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-methylpentan-3-ol hydrochloride with thionyl chloride to produce (−)-(2S,3S)-[3-chloro-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-methylpentyl]-dimethylamine hydrochloride, followed by subsequent removal of the ‘Cl’ substituent by treatment with zinc borohydride, zinc cyanoborohydride or tin cyanoborohydride, to produce (−)-(2R,3R)-[3-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-methylpentyl]-dimethylamine hydrochloride. The (−)-(2R,3R)-[3-(3-methoxy phenyl)-2-methylpentyl]-dimethylamine hydrochloride is then converted to (−)-(1R,2R)-3-(3-dimethylamino-1-ethyl-2-methylpropyl)-phenol (tapentadol) by reacting with concentrated hydrobromic acid at reflux. U.S. Patent Application No. 2007/0213405 (hereinafter referred to as the '405 application) discloses two crystalline polymorphs (Form A & Form B) of (−)-(1R,2R)-3-(3-dimethylamino-1-ethyl-2-methylpropyl)-phenol hydrochloride (tapentadol hydrochloride), and characterizes them by powder X-ray diffraction (P-XRD), Infra Red spectroscopy (IR), RAMAN spectroscopy and crystal structure analysis. The '405 application further teaches that the procedure described in example 25 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,737 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,344,558 as well as EP 693475 B1 produces crystalline Form B of tapentadol hydrochloride. U.S. Patent Application No. 2009/0149534 (hereinafter referred to as the '534 application) discloses three crystalline modifications (modifications A, B & C) of tapentadol base, processes for their preparation, and characterizes the modifications by powder X-ray diffraction (P-XRD) pattern and RAMAN spectroscopy.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Solid state forms of tapentadol salts, except the hydrochloride salt, have not been reported, isolated, or characterized in the literature. The present inventors have surprisingly and unexpectedly found that some of the acid addition salts of 3-[(1R,2R)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-ethyl-2-methylpropyl]phenol, i.e., tapentadol salts, specifically, L-(−)-camphorsulfonate, dibenzoyl-(L)-tartrate salt, dibenzoyl-(D)-tartrate salt, malate, maleate and salicylate salts, can be isolated as solid state forms. It has also been found that the solid state forms of tapentadol salts are useful intermediates in the preparation of tapentadol or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in high purity. The solid state forms of tapentadol salts have good flow properties, and are stable at room temperature, enhanced temperature, at relative high humidities, and in aqueous media. The novel solid state forms of tapentadol salts are suitable for formulating tapentadol. In the formulation of drug compositions, it is important for the active pharmaceutical ingredient to be in a form in which it can be conveniently handled and processed. Convenient handling is important not only from the perspective of obtaining a commercially viable manufacturing process, but also from the perspective of subsequent manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations (e.g., oral dosage forms such as tablets) comprising the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Chemical stability, solid state stability, and “shelf life” of the active pharmaceutical ingredient are important properties for a pharmaceutically active compound. The active pharmaceutical ingredient, and compositions containing it, should be capable of being effectively stored over appreciable periods of time, without exhibiting a significant change in the physico-chemical characteristics of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, e.g., its chemical composition, density, hygroscopicity and solubility. Thus, in the manufacture of commercially viable and pharmaceutically acceptable drug compositions, it is important, wherever possible, to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a stable form. New solid state forms of a pharmaceutical agent can further the development of formulations for the treatment of illnesses. For instance, solid forms of a compound are known in the pharmaceutical arts to affect, for example, the solubility, dissolution rate, bioavailability, chemical and physical stability, flowability, fractability, and compressibility of the compound, as well as the safety and efficacy of drug products based on the compound. The discovery of novel salts in solid state form of pharmaceutically useful compounds provides a new opportunity to improve the performance characteristics of a pharmaceutical product. It also adds value to the material that a formulation scientist can use the same for designing, for example, a pharmaceutical dosage form of a drug with a targeted release profile or other desired characteristic. According to one aspect, provided herein are novel and stable solid state forms of tapentadol salts, wherein the salt of tapentadol is an L-(−)-camphorsulfonate salt, a dibenzoyl-(L)-tartrate salt, a dibenzoyl-(D)-tartrate salt, a malate salt, a maleate salt or a salicylate salt. In one embodiment, the solid state forms of tapentadol salts exist in a crystalline form. In another embodiment, the solid state forms of tapentadol salts exist in an amorphous form. In yet another embodiment, the solid state forms of tapentadol salts exist in an anhydrous and/or solvent-free form, or as a hydrate and/or a solvate form. Such solvated or hydrated forms may be present as hemi-, mono-, sesqui-, di- or tri-solvates or hydrates. Solvates and hydrates may be formed as a result of the solvents used during the formation of the tapentadol salts becoming embedded in the solid lattice structure. Because formation of the solvates and hydrates occurs during the preparation of tapentadol salts, formation of a particular solvated or hydrated form depends greatly on the conditions and method used to prepare the salt. Solvents should be pharmaceutically acceptable. In one embodiment, the solid state forms of tapentadol salts have the following characteristics, wherein: a) the solid state form of tapentadol L-(−)-camphorsulfonate salt is characterized by one or more of the following properties: i) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern substantially in accordance with FIG. 1;ii) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having peaks at about 3.93, 5.66, 14.94, 16.16 and 21.52±0.2 degrees 2-theta;iii) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having additional peaks at about 8.01, 11.36, 14.10, 15.27, 15.91, 16.72, 19.06, 19.88, 21.85, 22.56, 23.92 and 27.12±0.2 degrees 2-theta; andiv) a differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) thermogram substantially in accordance with FIG. 2; b) the solid state form of tapentadol dibenzoyl-(L)-tartrate salt is characterized by one or more of the following properties: i) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern substantially in accordance with FIG. 3;ii) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having peaks at about 4.83, 5.76, 9.61, 16.08, 17.40 and 17.82±0.2 degrees 2-theta;iii) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having additional peaks at about 11.72, 13.26, 14.39, 17.19, 18.14, 18.90, 19.19, 20.88, 21.53, 21.88, 22.43, 22.78, 23.31, 23.53, 24.06, 26.58, 27.26, 27.98, 31.22, 34.75 and 34.96±0.2 degrees 2-theta; andiv) a differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) thermogram substantially in accordance with FIG. 4; c) the solid state form of tapentadol dibenzoyl-(D)-tartrate salt is characterized by one or more of the following properties: i) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern substantially in accordance with FIG. 5;ii) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having peaks at about 8.52, 9.39, 11.81, 12.28, 13.46, 14.06, 17.77, 17.97, 18.33, 18.79, 19.58 and 20.05±0.2 degrees 2-theta;iii) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having additional peaks at about 10.69, 11.61, 14.76, 21.41, 21.66, 22.19, 22.96, 23.23, 24.38, 25.72, 26.42, 27.60, 27.82, 28.29, 28.46 and 30.65±0.2 degrees 2-theta; andiv) a differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) thermogram substantially in accordance with FIG. 6; d) the solid state form of tapentadol malate salt is characterized by one or more of the following properties: i) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern substantially in accordance with FIG. 7;ii) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having peaks at about 9.80, 19.74, 20.27, 22.87 and 24.85±0.2 degrees 2-theta;iii) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having additional peaks at about 17.63, 22.56, 26.30, 26.74, 30.67, 31.15, 33.73, 34.12, 35.89, 38.19, 39.27, 41.27 and 43.44±0.2 degrees 2-theta; andiv) a differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) thermogram substantially in accordance with FIG. 8; e) the solid state form of tapentadol maleate salt is characterized by one or more of the following properties: i) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern substantially in accordance with FIG. 9;ii) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having peaks at about 15.31, 16.08, 21.08, 27.95, 28.53 and 29.51±0.2 degrees 2-theta;iii) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having peaks at about 19.13, 20.44, 22.90, 24.76, 30.66, 31.06, 31.81, 33.80, 34.84, 35.29, 38.31, 40.26, 40.68 and 43.16±0.2 degrees 2-theta; andiv) a differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) thermogram substantially in accordance with FIG. 10; (f) the solid state form of tapentadol salicylate salt is characterized by one or more of the following properties: i) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern substantially in accordance with FIG. 11;ii) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having peak at about 12.42, 12.75, 13.98, 15.37 and 19.81±0.2 degrees 2-theta;iii) a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having peak at about 16.39, 19.31, 21.06, 21.41, 21.98, 24.85, 25.03, 25.45, 26.54 and 27.88±0.2 degrees 2-theta; andiv) a differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) thermogram substantially in accordance with FIG. 12. The solid state forms of tapentadol salts are stable, consistently reproducible, and are particularly suitable for bulk preparation and handling. Moreover, the solid state forms of tapentadol salts are useful intermediates in the preparation of tapentadol free base and its hydrochloride salt in high purity. Specifically, the preparation of solid state form of tapentadol dibenzoyl-(D)-tartrate salt is advantageous since the product can be resolved and purified by removing undesired isomers at final stage, thereby producing tapentadol or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in high enantiomeric and chemical purity. According to another aspect, there is provided a process for the preparation of a solid state form of a tapentadol salt, wherein the salt of tapentadol is an L-(−)-camphorsulfonate salt, a dibenzoyl-(L)-tartrate salt, a dibenzoyl-(D)-tartrate salt, a malate salt, a maleate salt or a salicylate salt, comprising: a) providing a first solution or a suspension of tapentadol free base in a solvent, wherein the solvent is water, an alcohol, a ketone, a nitrile, a polar aprotic solvent, or a mixture thereof; b) combining the first solution or suspension with an acid to produce a second solution or suspension containing a tapentadol acid addition salt, wherein the acid is selected from the group consisting of L-(−)-camphorsulfonic acid, dibenzoyl-(L)-tartaric acid, dibenzoyl-(D)-tartaric acid, malic acid, maleic acid and salicylic acid; and c) isolating and/or recovering the solid state form of the tapentadol salt from the second solution or suspension obtained in step-(b). The process can produce the solid state forms of tapentadol salts in substantially pure form. The term “substantially pure solid state form of tapentadol salt” refers to the solid state form of tapentadol salt having a purity of greater than about 98 wt %, specifically greater than about 99 wt %, more specifically greater than about 99.5 wt %, and still more specifically greater than about 99.9 wt %. The purity is preferably measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). For example, the purity of the solid state form of tapentadol salt obtained by the process disclosed herein can be about 98% to about 99.95%, or about 99% to about 99.99%, as measured by HPLC. In one embodiment, the process disclosed herein provides stable solid state forms of tapentadol salts. The term “stable solid state form” refers to stability of the solid state form under the standard temperature and humidity conditions of testing of pharmaceutical products, wherein the stability is indicated by preservation of the original solid state form. In another embodiment, the solid state forms of tapentadol salts disclosed herein remain in the same solid state form and are stable, when stored at a temperature of about 25±2° C. and at a relative humidity of about 55±5% for a period of at least one month. In still another embodiment, the solid state forms of tapentadol salts disclosed herein remain in the same solid state form and are stable, when stored at a temperature of about 25±2° C. and at a relative humidity of about 55±5% for a period of 3 months. The term “remains stable”, as defined herein, refers to lack of formation of impurities, while being stored as described hereinbefore. In one embodiment, the solvent used in step-(a) is selected from the group consisting of water, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropyl alcohol, isobutanol, n-butanol, tert-butanol, amyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, hexanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl tert-butyl ketone, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and mixtures thereof. Specifically, the solvent is selected from the group consisting of water, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, acetone, acetonitrile, and mixtures thereof and more specifically water, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, acetonitrile, and mixtures thereof. Step-(a) of providing a first solution of tapentadol free base includes dissolving tapentadol free base in the solvent, or obtaining an existing solution from a previous processing step. In one embodiment, the tapentadol is dissolved in the solvent at a temperature of below about the boiling temperature of the solvent used, specifically at about 20° C. to about 110° C., and more specifically at about 25° C. to about 80° C. In another embodiment, step-(a) of providing a suspension of tapentadol free base includes suspending tapentadol free base in the solvent while stirring at a temperature of about 0° C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent used. In one embodiment, the suspension is stirred at a temperature of about 20° C. to about 110° C. for at least 30 minutes, and more specifically at a temperature of about 25° C. to about 80° C. for about 1 hour to about 10 hours. The first solution or suspension obtained in step-(a) is optionally stirred at a temperature of about 25° C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent used for at least 15 minutes, and specifically at a temperature of about 40° C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent used for about 20 minutes to about 5 hours. As used herein, “reflux temperature” means the temperature at which the solvent or solvent system refluxes or boils at atmospheric pressure. The acid in step-(b) may be used directly or in the form of a solution containing the acid and a solvent. The solvent used for dissolving the acid is selected from the group as described above. Combining of the first solution or suspension with acid in step-(b) is done in a suitable order, for example, the first solution or suspension is added to the acid, or alternatively, the acid is added to the first solution or suspension. The addition is, for example, carried out drop wise or in one portion or in more than one portion. The addition is specifically carried out at a temperature of below about 50° C., more specifically at about 15° C. to about 35° C., and most specifically at about 20° C. to about 30° C. under stirring. After completion of the addition process, the resulting mass is heated and stirred at a temperature of about 50° C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent used for at least 10 minutes, specifically at about 55° C. to about 100° C. for about 20 minutes to about 10 hours, and more specifically at a temperature of about 60° C. to about 90° C. for about 30 minutes to about 4 hours to produce a second solution or suspension. The second solution obtained in step-(b) is optionally subjected to carbon treatment or silica gel treatment. The carbon treatment or silica gel treatment is carried out by methods known in the art, for example, by stirring the solution with finely powdered carbon or silica gel at a temperature of below about 70° C. for at least 15 minutes, specifically at a temperature of about 40° C. to about 70° C. for at least 30 minutes; and filtering the resulting mixture through hyflo to obtain a filtrate containing tapentadol acid addition salt by removing charcoal or silica gel. Specifically, the finely powdered carbon is an active carbon. A specific mesh size of silica gel is 40-500 mesh, and more specifically 60-120 mesh. The isolation of pure solid state form of tapentadol salt in step-(c) is carried out by crystallization, substantial removal of the solvent from the solution or suspension, or a combination thereof. Crystallization may be initiated by a method usually known in the art such as cooling, seeding, partial removal of the solvent from the solution, by adding an anti-solvent to the solution or a combination thereof. The term “anti-solvent” refers to a solvent which when added to an existing solution of a substance reduces the solubility of the substance. Exemplary anti-solvents include, but are not limited to, a hydrocarbon, an ether, and mixtures thereof. Specifically, the anti-solvent is selected from the group consisting of n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, cyclohexane, toluene, xylene, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, monoglyme, diglyme, and mixtures thereof; and most specifically diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the crystallization is carried out by cooling the solution while stirring at a temperature of below 30° C. for at least 10 minutes, specifically at about 0° C. to about 25° C. for about 30 minutes to about 20 hours. The term “substantially removing” the solvent refers to at least 80%, specifically greater than about 85%, more specifically greater than about 90%, still more specifically greater than about 99%, and most specifically essentially complete (100%), removal of the solvent from the second solution or suspension. Removal of solvent is accomplished, for example, by substantially complete evaporation of the solvent, concentrating the solution or distillation of solvent, under inert atmosphere to obtain solid state form of tapentadol salt. In one embodiment, the solvent is removed by evaporation. Evaporation can be achieved at sub-zero temperatures by lyophilisation or freeze-drying techniques. The solution may also be completely evaporated in, for example, a pilot plant Rota vapor, a Vacuum Paddle Dryer or in a conventional reactor under vacuum above about 720 mm Hg by flash evaporation techniques by using an agitated thin film dryer (“ATFD”), or evaporated by spray drying to obtain a dry amorphous powder. The distillation process can be performed at atmospheric pressure or reduced pressure. Specifically, the solvent is removed at a pressure of about 760 mm Hg or less, more specifically at about 400 mm Hg or less, still more specifically at about 80 mm Hg or less, and most specifically from about 30 to about 80 mm Hg. Solvents can also be removed by spray-drying, in which a solution of tapentadol salt is sprayed into the spray drier at the flow rate of 10 to 300 ml/hr, specifically 40 to 200 ml/hr. The air inlet temperature to the spray drier used is about 30° C. to about 150° C., specifically about 65° C. to about 110° C. and the outlet air temperature used is about 30° C. to about 90° C. Another suitable method is vertical agitated thin-film drying (or evaporation). Agitated thin film evaporation technology involves separating the volatile component using indirect heat transfer coupled with mechanical agitation of the flowing film under controlled conditions. In vertical agitated thin-film drying (or evaporation) (ATFD-V), the starting solution is fed from the top into a cylindrical space between a centered rotary agitator and an outside heating jacket. The rotor rotation agitates the downside-flowing solution while the heating jacket heats it. The recovery in step-(c) is carried out by methods such as filtration, filtration under vacuum, decantation, centrifugation, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the solid state form of tapentadol salt is recovered by filtration employing a filtration media of, for example, a silica gel or celite. The substantially pure solid state form of tapentadol salt obtained by above process may be further dried in, for example, a Vacuum tray dryer, a Rotocon vacuum dryer, a Vacuum paddle dryer or a pilot plant Rota vapor, to further lower residual solvents. Drying can be carried out under reduced pressure until the residual solvent content reduces to the desired amount such as an amount within the limits given by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for human use (ICH) guide lines. In one embodiment the drying is carried out at atmospheric pressure or reduced pressures, such as below about 200 mm Hg, or below about 50 mm Hg, at temperatures such as 35° C. to about 80° C. The drying can be carried out for any desired time period that achieves the desired result, such as about 1 to 20 hours. Drying may also be carried out for shorter or longer periods of time depending on the product specifications. Temperature and pressure are chosen based on the volatility of the solvent being used and the foregoing should be considered as only a general guidance. Dying can be suitably carried out in a tray dryer, a vacuum oven, an air oven, or using a fluidized bed drier, a spin flash dyer, a flash dryer and the like. Drying equipment selection is well within the ordinary skill in the art. The solid state form of tapentadol salt obtained by the process disclosed herein is further optionally converted into tapentadol free base or its hydrochloride salt by treating the solid state form of tapentadol salt with a base and/or hydrochloric acid. The treatment of the solid state form of tapentadol salt with a base and/or an hydrochloric acid is carried out in a solvent selected from the group consisting of water, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol, amyl alcohol, hexanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl tert-butyl ketone, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, tert-butyl methyl acetate, ethyl formate, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, monoglyme, diglyme, n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, cyclohexane, toluene, xylene, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and mixtures thereof. The base suitable for converting the solid state form of tapentadol salt into tapentadol free base or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is an organic or inorganic base. Specific organic bases are triethyl amine, trimethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine and N-methylpiperidine. In another embodiment, the base is an inorganic base. Exemplary inorganic bases include, but are not limited to, ammonia; hydroxides, alkoxides, carbonates and bicarbonates of alkali or alkaline earth metals. Specific inorganic bases are ammonia, sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, lithium carbonate, sodium tert-butoxide, sodium isopropoxide and potassium tert-butoxide, and more specifically ammonia, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. The hydrochloric acid used may be in the form of concentrated hydrochloric acid, aqueous hydrochloric acid, in the form of hydrogen chloride gas, or hydrogen chloride dissolved in an organic solvent. The organic solvent used for dissolving hydrogen chloride gas or hydrogen chloride is selected from the group consisting of ethanol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, dimethyl ether, acetone, and mixtures thereof.
