(1-(2-(3-((1,3-dioxo-1,3,3a,4,7,7a-hexahydro-2H-4,7-methanoisoindol-2-yl)oxy)propoxy)acetyl)-4-((tris(4-methoxyphenyl)methoxy)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)methyl (2-cyanoethyl) diisopropylphosphoramidite 12h
Compound 8h (1.510 g, 2.0 mmol) and 2-cyanoethyl N,N,N',N'-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite (0.784 g, 2.6 mmol) in anhydrous acetonitrile (25 mL) were shaken with flame-dried molecular sieves 4 Å (1.5 g) for 1 h. This was cooled to −10° C., and 1H-tetrazole (0.45M, 1.0 mmol, 2.22 mL) in acetonitrile was added, and the mixture was stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was quenched with triethylamine (0.5 mL) and diluted with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The mixture was extracted with DCM, and the organic extract was dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness. The crude product was purified on a silica gel column (5% Et3N, 20-80% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to yield 12h (1.57 g, 82.2%) as a white solid foam.
