CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to and the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/949,819, entitled “Methods and Systems for Extracting Monocot Embryos,” filed Mar. 7, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for extracting monocot embryos from monocot seeds and, more particularly, to systems and methods for extracting monocot embryos from monocot seeds without damaging the monocot embryos. BACKGROUND Various large-scale systems have been proposed for extracting monocot embryos; however, these systems have generally been designed to perform in a manner that damages the monocot embryos during extraction and extracts portions of the monocot seed other than the monocot embryo. Current systems and methods for extracting monocot embryos typically extract the embryos through a distal end (crown) of the seeds while the seeds are still on their carrier. For example, a corn embryo is typically extracted by forcing the embryo through the crown of a kernel while the kernel is attached to a cob. The anatomy of corn kernels and other monocot seeds generally requires application of significant forces to extract embryos through the distal end (crown) of the seeds. These significant forces create undesirable stress on the embryo. Typically, current monocot embryo extraction methods also require sieving of the extracted material to ensure separation of the embryo from other materials. The sieving step requires application of further force to the embryos, thereby resulting in further stress on the embryos. Additionally, systems for extracting dicot embryos are not particularly suitable for extracting monocot embryos. Thus, there is a need for alternative methods to extract isolated, undamaged monocot embryos from monocot seeds. SUMMARY Disclosed herein are methods and systems which extract a monocot embryo from a singulated monocot seed that generally has been removed from its biological carrier, which as is known to those of skill in the art, may be a pod, a cob, or other plant structure associated with a seed. Herein, it may be referred to as a biological carrier to distinguish it from a part of a device that may carry objects. Those of skill in the art can distinguish the usage of the term. A monocot seed can be obtained and then placed in a liquid bath to achieve a desired orientation. In general, methods may comprise a three applied to the monocot seed to extract the monocot embryo. Optionally, the monocot embryo may be released into the liquid bath. In exemplary aspects, the monocot seed can be an immature monocot seed. Methods and systems disclosed herein may comprise automatically isolating a monocot embryo from a monocot seed having a proximal end and an opposed distal end. For orientation and understanding, prior to removal of the monocot seed from a biological carrier, the proximal end of the monocot seed is attached to the biological carrier and the distal end of the monocot seed is spaced from the biological carrier. An isolated monocot seed having an opening in the proximal end of the monocot seed can be provided following removal of the monocot seed from the biological carrier. At least a portion of the proximal end of the monocot seed may be removed to form the opening in the proximal end of the monocot seed without damage to the monocot embryo. The monocot embryo can be extracted through the opening in the proximal end of the monocot seed, and the monocot embryo is generally undamaged following extraction. Following extraction of the monocot embryo, the undamaged monocot embryo may retain an ability to grow with full viability and vigor. In exemplary aspects, the monocot seed can be an immature monocot seed. Methods and systems disclosed herein may comprise regenerating a plant from a monocot embryo of a monocot seed. In exemplary aspects, the monocot seed can be an immature monocot seed. The monocot embryo can be automatically extracted from the monocot seed without damage to the monocot embryo. The monocot embryo can have a meristematic section and a scutellum section. A sample portion of the scutellum section of the monocot embryo can be removed without damage to the extracted monocot embryo. The sample portion and the viable embryo can be tracked and identified in a 1 to 1 relationship. The sample portion of the scutellum section of the monocot embryo can be genetically analyzed, and a plant can be regenerated from the remaining portion of the monocot embryo (including the meristematic section). Methods and systems disclosed herein may permit individual analysis of each of a plurality of monocot seeds. A monocot embryo from each respective monocot seed of a plurality of monocot seeds can be automatically extracted, and a sample portion of the scutellum section of the monocot embryo of each respective monocot seed can be removed without damage to the monocot embryo. A sample portion of the embryo, such as a scutellum section of a monocot embryo, of each respective monocot seed can be analyzed, for example, genetically analyzed, and the remaining portions of the monocot embryo of each respective monocot seed can be selected or discarded on the basis of the genetic analysis of the sample portion of the scutellum section of the monocot embryo of each respective monocot seed. For example, a sample may be obtained from a portion of the embryo, and may comprise one or more cells. It is contemplated that the sample from the embryo can be as small as a single nucleus. The remaining portions of the monocot embryo(s) of at least one monocot seed of the plurality of monocot seeds can be selected, and at least one plant can be regenerated from the remaining portions of each respective selected monocot embryo. Disclosed herein, in one aspect, is a system for removing chaff from a corn kernel. The system can have a plate assembly and a pulley assembly. The plate assembly can have at least one guide plate and a perforated plate. The perforated plate can have a first surface and an opposed second surface and define a plurality of bores that extend from the first surface to the second surface relative to a first axis. The at least one guide plate and the first surface of the perforated plate can cooperate to define a receiving channel that extends parallel to a second axis and has an inlet portion and an outlet portion, with the second axis being substantially perpendicular to the first axis. The inlet portion of the receiving channel can be configured to receive at least one corn kernel. The perforated plate can be configured for selective oscillating movement relative to a third axis that is substantially perpendicular to both the first and second axes. The first surface of the perforated plate can have a desired surface roughness. The pulley assembly can be configured to effect movement of the at least one seed relative to the second axis from the inlet portion of the receiving channel of the plate assembly to the outlet portion of the receiving channel of the plate assembly. The at least one guide plate of the plate assembly can be configured to restrict movement of the at least one corn kernel relative to the third axis. During oscillating movement of the perforated plate, the perforated plate can be configured to pull chaff away from the at least one corn kernel as the corn kernel moves relative to the second axis within the receiving channel of the plate assembly. In a further aspect, disclosed herein is a system for extracting an embryo from a corn kernel. The system can have a longitudinal axis, a liquid bath, a belt assembly, a force application assembly, and an embryo collection tube. The belt assembly can be positioned within the liquid bath and be configured to sequentially advance a plurality of corn kernels relative to the longitudinal axis of the system. Optionally, the force application assembly can be positioned within the liquid bath. The three application assembly can include a kernel stabilizing portion, at least one wheel, and a squeezing portion. The kernel stabilizing portion can define a receiving channel that is configured to receive and support an individual corn kernel in a desired position as the corn kernel is advanced relative to the longitudinal axis of the system. In the desired position, at least a portion of a proximal end of the corn kernel can extend upwardly from the kernel stabilizing portion relative to a vertical axis that is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the system. The at least one wheel can be operatively positioned relative to the kernel stabilizing portion. The at least one wheel can be selectively rotatable to apply a force to the proximal end of the corn kernel as the corn kernel is advanced through the receiving channel of the kernel stabilizing portion relative to the longitudinal axis of the system. The force applied by the at least one wheel can be sufficient to form a hole or opening in the proximal end of the corn kernel. The squeezing portion can have first and second opposed squeeze bars that are spaced apart relative to a transverse axis that is substantially perpendicular to the vertical axis and the longitudinal axis of the system. The opposed squeeze bars can cooperate to define a channel that is configured to receive a corn kernel from the kernel stabilizing portion as the corn kernel is advanced relative to the longitudinal axis of the system. At least one of the opposed squeeze bars can be biased toward the other squeeze bar relative to the transverse axis. The opposed squeeze bars can be configured to apply a radial squeezing force to the corn kernel as it moves through the channel of the squeezing portion relative to the longitudinal axis. The embryo collection tube can be positioned in fluid communication with the liquid bath and configured to receive liquid containing an embryo extracted from a corn kernel in response to application of the radial squeezing force by the squeezing portion of the system. Optionally, the system for extracting an embryo from a corn kernel can include a singulation assembly configured to receive a plurality of corn kernels and separate a single corn kernel from the remaining corn kernels of the plurality of corn kernels. Optionally, the system for extracting an embryo from a corn kernel can also include an indexing assembly configured to receive a single corn kernel from the singulation assembly and to transport the single corn kernel to the belt assembly in a desired orientation. In exemplary aspects, the indexing assembly can be at least partially positioned within the liquid bath. The singulation assembly can have an outlet, and the indexing assembly can have an inlet. The outlet of the singulation assembly can be positioned in communication with the inlet of the indexing assembly. Also disclosed herein, in various aspects, are methods of using one or more of the disclosed systems to singulate a kernel, remove chaff from a kernel, and/or extract a corn embryo from a kernel.

FIG. 1 depicts various components of a corn (e.g., maize) seed 10 (corn kernel), including the endosperm 20 and the embryo 12. As shown in FIG. 1, the endosperm 20 borders the embryo 12, and the embryo and endosperm are encased by the pericarp 18. Depending on the age of the seed 10, the endosperm 20 may be starchier toward the distal end 24 of the seed and more gel-like toward the proximal end 22 of the seed. The seed 10 has side portions 26 extending between the proximal end 22 and the distal end 24. FIG. 2A depicts an ear 30 of corn. As shown, the ear 30 has a proximal end 32 (where the stalk is/was attached) and an opposed distal end 34. As shown, the ear has fertilized corn seeds (kernels) 10. However, it is understood that at least the distal portion of some ears (near the distal end 34) can have unfertilized corn seeds (kernels) 11. FIG. 2B is a cross section of an ear 30 of corn. As shown the corn kernels 10 can define the outer circumference of the ear 30. Moving radially inwardly from the corn seeds (kernels) 10, the ear 30 can include bees' wings 36, chaff 38, a woody ring 40, and a pith 42. As used herein, the term “cob” refers to the biological carrier for corn, not including the corn seeds (kernels). As used herein, the term “ear” refers to a cob with attached corn seeds (kernels) and may or may not be wrapped in husk. As used herein, and as shown in FIG. 1, “embryo” or “monocot embryo” 12 consists of a meristematic section 16 and scutellum section 14. As used herein, the “meristematic section” of the monocot embryo refers to the essential genetic information and embryonic structures required for the monocot embryo to grow into a plant. As used herein, the “scutellum section” of the monocot embryo refers to the tissue that generally surrounds the meristematic section within the monocot embryo and stores nutrients mobilized during germination of a monocot seed. The scutellum section generally functions as a barrier between the endosperm of a monocot seed and the meristematic tissue of a monocot embryo. As used herein, an “immature” monocot seed refers to a monocot seed harvested within a selected number of days after pollination. As used herein, an “immature” monocot seed refers to a monocot seed harvested after fertilization but prior to physiological maturity and, except in the case of hard coat seeds, does not germinate in water without external nutrients. In some examples, the harvest is contemplated to occur between 200 and 750 Growth Degree Units (GDUs) after pollination. As used herein, an “undamaged” embryo or an embryo “without damage” refers to an embryo that does not exhibit substantial bruising after being extracted and retains an ability to grow with full viability and vigor. For example, a monocot embryo is “undamaged” following extraction if the viability and vigor of the monocot embryo is substantially unchanged following extraction. In exemplary aspects, it is contemplated that a monocot embryo is “undamaged” following extraction if the viability and vigor of the monocot embryo are at least 50% of the viability and vigor of monocot embryos extracted using conventional hand extraction methods. In one exemplary aspect, a monocot embryo is “undamaged” following extraction if the viability and vigor of the monocot embryo are at least 60% of the viability and vigor of monocot embryos extracted using conventional hand extraction methods. In another exemplary aspect, a monocot embryo is “undamaged” following extraction if the viability and vigor of the monocot embryo are at least 70% of the viability and vigor of monocot embryos extracted using conventional hand extraction methods. In another exemplary aspect, a monocot embryo is “undamaged” following extraction if the viability and vigor of the monocot embryo are at least 80% of the viability and vigor of monocot embryos extracted using conventional hand extraction methods. In still another exemplary aspect, a monocot embryo is “undamaged” following extraction if the viability and vigor of the monocot embryo are at least 90% of the viability and vigor of monocot embryos extracted using conventional hand extraction methods. In a further exemplary aspect, a monocot embryo is “undamaged” following extraction if the viability and vigor of the monocot embryo are at least 95% of the viability and vigor of monocot embryos extracted using conventional hand extraction methods. In general, viability refers to the ability of the embryo to germinate and develop into a plantlet under tissue culture or growth medium conditions known to those skilled in the art. In general, vigor refers to the growth and development of the resultant plantlet, up to and including male and female flowering, kernel development, reached kernel physiological maturity. In other exemplary aspects, it is contemplated that a monocot embryo is “undamaged” following extraction if the germination of the monocot embryo generates a viable plantlet. As used herein, the term “automatic” or “automatically” refers to the use of mechanical, electrical, software, imaging, vision-based and/or other known automation-based technologies to augment processes typically performed by human interaction. II. Methods of Extracting Monocot Embryos from Immature Monocot Seeds In various aspects, and with reference to FIG. 22, a method of extracting a monocot embryo from a monocot seed is provided.

Optionally, in one aspect, a method can further comprise placing the monocot seed in a liquid bath. In an aspect, it is contemplated that placement of the monocot seed in the liquid bath can cause the monocot seed to orient itself in a desired orientation. For example, it is contemplated that positioning of a corn kernel within a liquid bath can cause the corn kernel to orient itself with a distal end (crown) of the kernel facing away from a surface of the liquid bath and a proximal end of the kernel facing toward the surface of the liquid bath. Alternatively, the method can comprise placing the monocot seed in the desired orientation using other means, including, for example and without limitation, manually positioning the crown of the monocot seed (e.g., corn kernel) onto a vacuum cup that holds the monocot seed in the desired orientation, or using conventional machine vision techniques to locate and then automatically (e.g., robotically) pick and place monocot seeds (e.g., corn kernels) in the desired orientation as needed. In an aspect, a method can further comprise applying force to extract the monocot embryo from the monocot seed.

In an aspect, it is contemplated that the monocot seed can optionally be wholly submerged in the liquid bath during the step of applying force to the monocot embryo. Alternatively, it is contemplated that the distal end of the monocot seed can be submerged in the liquid bath while at least a portion of the proximal end is positioned above the surface of the liquid bath. Optionally, it is contemplated that the entire monocot seed can be positioned above the surface of the liquid bath such that the monocot embryo is released into the liquid bath upon extraction. Optionally, in an aspect, it is contemplated that a monocot seed can be a corn seed (kernel) or a sorghum seed or a wheat seed or a rice seed. In this aspect, the monocot seed can optionally be an immature monocot seed. In further aspects, it is contemplated that a monocot embryo can be undamaged following extraction from the monocot seed. In these aspects, it is contemplated that, following extraction of a monocot embryo from the monocot seed, the monocot embryo can retain an ability to grow with full viability and vigor.

Optionally, in additional aspects, it is contemplated that a monocot embryo of the monocot seed can be extracted such that the endosperm of a monocot seed is not substantially extracted from the monocot seed. It is still further contemplated that an extracted monocot embryo of a monocot seed can be sufficiently separated from other material following extraction such that sieving of the extracted monocot embryo is not required. In an aspect, the monocot seed can have a proximal end and an opposed distal end. In an aspect, it is contemplated that, prior to removal of the immature monocot seed from a biological carrier, the proximal end of the monocot seed can be attached to the biological carrier and the distal end of the monocot seed can be spaced from the biological carrier. In exemplary aspects, when the monocot seed is a corn kernel, the proximal end of the corn kernel can comprise a tip cap of the corn kernel and the distal end of the corn kernel can comprise a crown of the corn kernel. Optionally, in some aspects, it is contemplated that an opening or hole can be formed in the proximal end of the monocot seed. In an aspect, an opening or hole in the proximal end of the monocot seed can optionally be formed before force is applied to the monocot seed. In an aspect, it is contemplated that the monocot seed can be positioned in any location permitting application of force to the monocot seed as disclosed herein. In aspects, it is contemplated that an opening or hole in the proximal end of the monocot seed can optionally be formed before the monocot seed is obtained. Alternatively, in other optional aspects, it is contemplated that an opening or hole in the proximal end of the monocot seed can be made after the monocot seed has been obtained. Optionally, in some aspects, it is contemplated that the method can further comprise cleaning at least the proximal end of the monocot seed. In aspects, a step of cleaning at least the proximal end of the monocot seed can comprise sterilizing the surface of the monocot seed. In other exemplary aspects, it is contemplated that a monocot seed can be cleaned before the monocot seed is obtained. Optionally, in aspects, the surface of the monocot seed can be sterilized before the monocot seed is obtained. Optionally, in other aspects, it is contemplated that the monocot embryo can be extracted from the monocot seed without the need for forming an opening or hole in the monocot seed. In these aspects, it is contemplated that at least a portion of the monocot seed can be placed in the liquid bath. Optionally, it is contemplated that the monocot seed can optionally be wholly submerged in the liquid bath prior to the application of force to the monocot seed. Alternatively, it is contemplated that the distal end of the monocot seed can optionally be submerged in the liquid bath while at least a portion of the proximal end is positioned above the surface of the liquid bath. It is further contemplated that the entire monocot seed can be positioned above the surface of the liquid bath prior to and during the application of force to the monocot seed. In exemplary aspects, when an opening or hole is formed in the monocot seed, it is contemplated that the step of applying force to extract the monocot embryo can comprise applying pressure to at least one side portion of the monocot seed to force the monocot embryo through the opening or hole in the proximal end of the monocot seed. In these aspects, the monocot seed comprises side portions extending from the proximal end to the distal end of the seed. It is contemplated that the step of applying pressure to at least one side portion of the monocot seed can comprise supporting the monocot seed in a selected orientation while pressure is applied to the at least one side portion of the monocot seed. In an exemplary aspect, the step of applying pressure to at least one side portion of the monocot seed can comprise applying a rolling force to the at least one side portion moving in a direction from the distal end of the seed toward the proximal end of the seed. In other exemplary aspects, when an opening or hole is not formed in the monocot seed, it is contemplated that the step of applying force to extract the monocot embryo can comprise applying pressure to the at least one side portion of the monocot seed to split a portion of the proximal end of the monocot seed and to force the monocot embryo through an opening or hole defined by the split portion of the monocot seed. In these aspects, it is contemplated that the step of applying pressure to the at least one side portion of the monocot seed can comprise supporting the monocot seed in a selected orientation while pressure is applied to the at least one side portion of the monocot seed. Optionally, in some aspects, the monocot seed can be wholly submerged in the liquid bath when the force is applied to the monocot seed. In these aspects, it is contemplated that the selected orientation of the monocot seed can correspond to the proximal end of the monocot seed being pointed toward the surface of the liquid bath.

In this aspect, the drill actuator 118 is configured to advance drilling assembly 116 to thereby advance the stalk removal tool 117 to remove hard stalk material 45 from the proximal end of the ear in order to provide access to the softer pith 42 of the ear. In exemplary aspects, the at least one clamp assembly 110a, 110b can be configured for movement between a first operative position (shown in FIGS. 3A-3B) and a second operative position. In the first operative position, the at least one clamp assembly 110a, 110b can be configured to support an ear of corn as the drilling assembly 116 is activated to remove stalk material and provide access to the pith 42 of the ear. After the drilling assembly has completed its removal of the stalk material, the drilling assembly 116 can be withdrawn from the ear, and the at least one clamp assembly 110a, 110b can be moved to the second operative position while maintaining its engagement of the ear. It is contemplated that the movement of the at least one clamp assembly 110a, 110b can occur manually or by using automated means, such as, for example and without limitation, an actuator.

In further optional aspects, the system 100 can further comprise a starting cylinder 187 that is configured to selectively adjust an operative position of the cutting head 176 (and cutting member 172) relative to a cob. In these aspects, the starting cylinder can be configured to lock the cutting head in an operative position in which the cutting head defines a cutting orifice, which corresponds to a smallest diameter which is cut by the cutting member 172 as the cob advances relative to the orientation axis 173. In these aspects, the starting cylinder 187 can be operatively coupled to the cutting head 176 and configured to lock the cutting had in a position that defines a cutting orifice of a desired size. In exemplary aspects, it is contemplated that an ear of corn can be placed in a centering fixture, such as, for example, the at least one clamp assembly disclosed herein. It is further contemplated that stalk material covering the center of the ear, at the proximal end, can be removed to expose the pith. After the stalk material is removed from the ear, a spindle can be inserted into the center of the ear at the proximal end, as disclosed herein. As shown in FIGS. 5A-5C, it is contemplated that a rigid spindle can reduce ear curvature. Once the spindle is inserted into the ear, the ear can be released from the centering fixture (e.g., at least one clamp assembly). During rotation, the ear can be driven axially through a cutting assembly as disclosed herein, starting with the distal end of the ear. Optionally, in one exemplary aspect, when an independent arm cutting assembly as disclosed herein is used to remove the corn kernels from a cob, the cutting mechanism can comprise a cutting portion and/or a grinding portion that can be mounted on one or more cutting arms that pivot at arcs intersecting the orientation axis. It is further contemplated that the grinding portion can be configured to rapidly advance radially towards the center of the ear by removing the softer outer structures of the ear. This radial removal of the material can greatly decrease when the grinding portion reaches the denser woody ring of the ear. In this aspect, it is contemplated that the cutting portion, which is positioned at a fixed offset from the grinding portion relative to the cob, can release intact corn kernels from the cob at a corresponding offset above the woody ring of the ear. The removed corn kernels can then fall away into a bin or other receptacle. Optionally, in another exemplary aspect, when a cob-following cutting assembly as disclosed herein is used to remove the corn kernels from a cob, the cutting mechanism can comprise a v-shaped guide (defined by the first and second engagement surfaces) which can contact the ear and constantly positions the cutting member at a desired location relative to the ear. It is further contemplated that the support arm can be spring-loaded to maintain 3-point contact with the ear. The cutting member, which can have an integrated grinder or glider, can be mounted on a sliding mechanism designed to move the cutting edge of the blade perfectly radially toward the center of the ear while maintaining the depth of the cut. As the ear rotates, the cutting head can pivot and translate to maintain perfect radial alignment with the ear. In this aspect, it is contemplated that the cutting member can be forced radially toward the cob using an air cylinder 188, such as, for example and without limitation, a low-friction air cylinder. Initially, at the distal end of the ear where there are often unfertilized kernels and a softer woody ring, the air cylinder can be configured to apply radial minimal radial force (a “low force” operating condition). After reaching an area of the cob where kernels are present, the woody ring can be denser, and the air cylinder can be configured to apply greater radial force (a “high pressure” operating condition) to the cutting member, and this setting can be applied for the remaining length of the ear. Following removal of the corn kernels as disclosed herein, the spindle can be withdrawn from the cob, and the cob can be discarded when the cutting assembly reaches the proximal end of the ear. iii. Kernel Conditioning In one aspect, it is contemplated that the intact corn kernels can be sorted to separate out any unfertilized corn kernels, debris, or damaged corn kernels. It is further contemplated that the intact corn kernels can be agitated in air and/or water to remove loose chaff and bees' wings. Any kernels with excess attached chaff can be run through a separate “de-chaffing” process to remove the excess chaff. The intact kernels can then be ready for further processing. An exemplary system 200 for removing chaff from corn kernels is depicted in FIGS. 12A-12C.

Singulation Assembly (Wet) An exemplary singulation assembly that singulates seeds with the use of liquid flow is depicted in FIGS. 17A-17C. In one aspect, the singulation assembly 330 comprises a hopper as disclosed with respect to singulation assembly 310. In another aspect, the singulation assembly 330 comprises a circulation trough 332 that receives water or another selected liquid. A liquid conduit 334 is positioned in communication with the circulation trough 332 to permit selective delivery of liquid to the circulation trough. In use, the outlet of the hopper is positioned in communication with the circulation trough 332, and the circulation trough receives corn kernels from outlet of the hopper. The liquid conduit 334 can be positioned in communication with a liquid source, which can selectively deliver liquid to the liquid conduit to provide circulation and flow to the corn kernels within the circulation trough. In another aspect, the singulation assembly 330 can comprise a track portion 336 having an inlet 338 and an outlet 340.

The optical sensor 348 can be positioned to detect the presence or absence of a corn kernel within the track and proximate the gate. With the gate in the blocking position, upon detecting the presence of a corn kernel, the optical sensor 348 can be configured to communicate an output to the actuator 346, thereby effecting movement of the gate from the blocking position to the open position to permit passage of the corn kernel. Optionally, the output can be communicated to a rotational actuator (not shown) positioned in operative communication with the brush such that, upon detecting the presence of a corn kernel, the rotational actuator can be configured to cease rotation of the brush.

In exemplary aspects, it is contemplated the housing 308 can be selectively detached from the remaining portions of the system 300 to permit cleaning of the various non-electrical components of the system without exposure to electrical components. Although disclosed below as being part of an integrated system, it is contemplated that the indexing assembly 350, belt assembly 380, and force application assembly 420 can be provided as independent and/or freestanding systems. 1. Indexing Assembly An exemplary indexing assembly is depicted in FIGS. 14A-15B. As shown, the indexing assembly 350 can be at least partially positioned within the liquid bath 305 and configured to receive a single corn kernel (optionally, from the singulation assembly 310, 330) and to transport the single corn kernel to the belt assembly 380 in a desired orientation. In exemplary aspects, the indexing assembly 350 can have an inlet 351 that is positioned in fluid communication with the outlet 325, 340 of the singulation assembly 310, 330. In exemplary aspects, the indexing assembly 350 can comprise a wheel 360 having a circumference and being configured for rotation about a rotational axis 363 that is substantially parallel to the transverse axis 304 of the system 300. The wheel 360 can define a plurality of receptacles 362 about its circumference. In one exemplary aspect, each respective receptacle 362 can be configured to receive a single immature corn kernel when the receptacle is at a first rotational position 365a relative to the rotational axis 363. In this aspect, it is contemplated that each receptacle 362 can be configured to permit the corn kernel to exit the receptacle when the receptacle is positioned in a second rotational position 365b relative to the rotational axis. In another exemplary aspect, the first rotational position 365a of the receptacle is proximate the inlet 351 of the indexing assembly 350, and the second rotational position 365b of the receptacle is within the liquid bath 305. In an additional aspect, the indexing assembly 350 can comprise a wheel actuator/drive shaft 361 that is operatively coupled to the wheel. In this aspect, the wheel actuator/drive shaft 361 can be configured to effect rotation of the wheel 360 about the rotational axis 363. In exemplary aspects, a portion of the wheel actuator 361 (including all electrical components of the wheel actuator) can be positioned in an operative position within or above housing 308, with the shaft extending through an opening defined by the housing. In a further aspect, the indexing assembly 350 can further comprise a sensor 352 configured to produce an output indicative of the presence or absence of a corn kernel within the inlet 351 of the indexing assembly. In this aspect, the sensor 352 can be positioned in operative communication with the wheel actuator 361 and configured to communicate the output to the wheel actuator. In response to receiving an output indicative of the presence of a corn kernel at the inlet 351 of the indexing assembly 350, the wheel actuator 361 can be configured to effect rotation of the wheel 360. In exemplary aspects, the sensor 352 can be an optical sensor. In exemplary aspects, the wheel 360 can comprise first and second outer plates 367a, 367b that are spaced apart relative to the rotational axis 363 (and the transverse axis 304 of the system). In these aspects, the wheel 360 can further comprise a kernel releaser 364 that is positioned between the first and second outer plates and fixedly secured to a frame portion 355 of the wheel. That is, the kernel releaser 364 can be stationary as the wheel 360 rotates relative to the frame 355. The kernel releaser 364 can be secured to the frame of the wheel 360 such that at least a portion of the kernel releaser projects into a receptacle 362 as the receptacle approaches the second rotational position 365b. In use, as the receptacle 362 continues its rotation, the kernel releaser 364 can increasingly project into the receptacle until any kernels within the receptacle (e.g., stuck kernels) are forced out of the receptacle. The presence of the kernel releaser 364 thereby ensures that all kernels exit their receptacle before the receptacle completes a full rotation. In exemplary aspects, the indexing assembly 350 can further comprise a guard element 366 that is secured to the frame portion 355 of the wheel 360 and radially spaced from the circumference of the wheel 360, with the guard element 366 extending at least partially around the circumference of the wheel. In these aspects, it is contemplated that the guard element 366 can be configured to guide any corn kernel that exits a receptacle during rotation of the wheel. It is contemplated that the guard element can be configured to direct such corn kernel toward the liquid bath, thereby ensuring that no corn kernel is lost or contaminated. Optionally, in exemplary aspects, the indexing assembly 350 can comprise a liquid dispenser (not shown) that is positioned proximate an upper attachment point of the guard element 366, where the guard element is secured to the frame portion of the wheel. In these aspects, the liquid dispenser can be configured to dispense liquid in a downward direction relative to the vertical axis 306 as the wheel 360 rotates. It is contemplated that the liquid dispenser can be positioned such that the liquid dispensed by the dispenser keeps kernels within receptacles when the receptacles are at a rotational position near the top of the wheel and flushes kernels out of their receptacles as they approach the second rotational position 365b. It is further contemplated that the liquid dispensed by the dispenser can help reduce the surface tension of the kernels, causing them to more readily sink within the liquid bath. In use, once the sensor detects a kernel in a receptacle at the first rotational position, the wheel can be rotated such that the next sequential receptacle is positioned at the first rotational position, thereby permitting entry of the next corn kernel delivered by the singulation assembly. The corn kernel remains with a given receptacle until the receptacle reaches the second rotational position (within the liquid bath), at which point the corn kernel can fall out of the receptacle into the liquid bath. Thus, in exemplary aspects, and with reference to FIG. 25A, the indexing assembly 350 can be used to sequentially deliver corn kernels to a liquid bath. In one aspect, a method of using the indexing assembly can comprise positioning an immature corn kernel within a receptacle defined about the circumference of the wheel, with the immature corn kernel being positioned within the receptacle when the receptacle is at the first rotational position relative to the rotational axis. In another aspect, the method can comprise rotating the wheel about the rotational axis to position the receptacle at the second rotational position. In the second rotational position, the corn kernel can exit the receptacle into the liquid bath. Optionally, during rotation of the receptacle from the first rotational position to the second rotational position, the receptacle can enter the liquid bath. 2.

It is contemplated that each receptacle of the feed chain 370 can be configured to receive a single corn kernel and transport the corn kernel relative to the longitudinal axis 302 of the system 300. In exemplary aspects, the receptacles 374 can be defined by a plurality of spaced paddles 372 that are secured to and project outwardly from the chain 370. In further exemplary aspects, the chain 370 can be operatively coupled to wheels 376, which, in turn, are operatively coupled to a drive shaft/actuator 371 that is configured to effect movement of the chain. In these aspects, it is contemplated that a portion of the drive shaft/actuator 371 (including all electrical components of the actuator) can be positioned in an operative position within or above housing 308, with the shaft extending through an opening defined by the housing. In further exemplary aspects, and with reference to FIG. 15A, the wheel 360 of the indexing assembly can further comprise a kernel sinker 368 that is secured to a frame portion of the wheel and radially spaced from the circumference of the wheel. The kernel sinker 368 can define a guide surface 369 that is spaced a selected distance above the chain 370 relative to the vertical axis 306. In one aspect, the guide surface 369 can be configured to ensure that no floating kernels are allowed to enter into the belt transport assembly as further disclosed herein; in other words, the guide surface 369 is positioned and shaped to force (e.g., knock down) any semi-buoyant corn kernel to enter a respective receptacle 374. In exemplary aspects, and with reference to FIG. 19, it is contemplated that the fluid within the fluid bath can cause the kernels within the liquid bath to sink with their tips upward so that the receptacles 374 of the chain 370 receive the kernels in this orientation. Thus, in exemplary aspects, the desired orientation can be an orientation in which the tip caps of the kernels are oriented in an upward direction relative to the vertical axis 306. In exemplary aspects, and with reference to FIG. 25A, a method of using the indexing assembly 350 can comprise receiving a corn kernel within a receptacle defined by the feed chain, with the feed chain positioned within the liquid bath. In another aspect, the method can comprise effecting axial movement of the feed chain relative to the longitudinal axis 302 of the system 300 to transport the corn kernel relative to the longitudinal axis. 3. Belt Transport In exemplary aspects, the belt assembly 380 can be positioned within the liquid bath 305 and configured to sequentially advance a plurality of corn kernels relative to the longitudinal axis 302 of the system 300. In one exemplary aspect, the belt assembly 380 can comprise first and second side transport belts 390a, 390b that are spaced apart relative to the transverse axis 304 of the system 300 to define a transport channel 394 that extends substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis 302 of the system.

That is, the transport channel 394 can be positioned between the ceiling belt 400 and the lifter belt 410 relative to the vertical axis 306. In these aspects, the lifter belt can have an upper surface 415 that is configured to engage a corn kernel within the transport channel 394 and drive upward movement of the corn kernel relative to the vertical axis 306 until the corn kernel contacts the lower surface 405 of the ceiling belt 400. In exemplary aspects, the side transport belts 390a, 390b can be operatively coupled to an actuator (not shown) through a combination of wheels 391 and/or pulleys 392, which are operatively coupled to drive shaft 396 to impart movement to the belts. In further exemplary aspects, the ceiling belt 400 can be operatively coupled to an actuator (not shown) through wheel 401 and pulley 402, which are operatively coupled to a drive shaft 404 to impart movement to the ceiling belt. In still further exemplary aspects, the lifter belt 410 can be operatively coupled to an actuator (not shown) through wheel 412 and pulley 413, which are operatively coupled to a drive shaft 416 to impart movement to the lifter belt. In exemplary aspects, the lifter belt 410 can comprise a lifter arm 414 that extends between and is coupled to the wheel 412 and the pulley 413. In exemplary aspects, at least a portion of the drive shafts 396, 404, 416 and their associated actuators (not shown), including all electrical components of the actuators, can be positioned in an operative position within or above housing 308, with the shafts extending through corresponding openings defined by the housing. In operation, after a kernel is pulled into the side transport belts, the belt lifter can make contact with the bottom of the kernel. The kernel can then be lifted to make contact with the ceiling belt. In this aspect, the kernels can continue to move with the side transport belts and can enter the force application assembly 420 at a consistent tip height. Thus, in exemplary aspects, and with reference to FIG. 25A, a method of using the belt assembly 380 can comprise delivering an immature corn kernel from a receptacle of the feed chain to the transport channel. In these aspects, the method can further comprise driving movement of the immature corn kernel relative to the longitudinal axis using the side transport belts of the belt assembly.

The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 1 Comparison of the Condition and Quality of immature Corn Embryos Extracted Using Five Different Methods Immature corn embryos were extracted using five different methods: hand extraction; high-pressure water; suction; hand squeezing; and semi-automated squeezing. The condition and quality of extracted embryos was evaluated for each respective method. One ear of immature corn was used for each extraction method. The embryos were 2.0-3.5 mm long and were extracted 12-18 days post-pollination (corresponding to 340-380 Growing Degree Units (GDUs)). The embryos were substantially the same size as those used in typical Doubled Haploid production methods. a. Sterilization and Cleaning Initially, the husks and silks were removed from four ears of immature corn. After removal of the husks and silks, each ear was secured to an ear holder. The ears were then positioned within an empty pitcher. The pitcher was then filled with a solution containing 20%-50% CLOROX Bleach, one drop of TWEEN® 20, and tap water. The ears were soaked in the sterilizing solution, with the ears being rotated occasionally using the ear holders. After 15-20 minutes of soaking, the ears were removed from solution and then rinsed three times with tap water. b. Seed Preparation For the hand, high-pressure water, and suction extraction methods, the ear was held using the ear holder, and a scalpel was used to slice off the kernel caps of each corn kernel on the ear. For the hand-squeezing extraction method, the ear was held using the ear holder, and a fingertip was used to remove whole seeds from the cob. A scalpel was then used to slice off the individual kernel tips of the seeds. For the semi-automated squeezing extraction method, the ear was held using the ear holder, and a fingertip was used to remove whole seeds from the cob. c. Embryo Extraction For the hand extraction method, a spatula was used to remove 30 embryos from an ear (with the seed caps removed). For the high-pressure water extraction method, an ear (with the seed caps removed) was selectively positioned, and a hand-pressure nozzle was used to wash the embryos out of the seeds and into catch pans (dishes). Tap water was used to wash the embryo debris through mesh sieves of decreasing size until the embryos could be clearly identified. A spatula was used to remove 30 embryos from the sieve. For the vacuum extraction method, a vacuum pump was used to remove embryos from an ear (with the seed caps removed) via tubing. The tubing was positioned in fluid communication with an Erlenmeyer flask such that the extracted embryos were delivered to the flask. The embryos within the flask were washed with tap water through mesh sieves of decreasing size to separate the embryos from embryo debris until the embryos could be clearly identified. A spatula was used to remove 30 embryos from the sieve. For the hand-squeezing extraction method, each seed (with its tip removed) was positioned between the thumb and forefinger of an operator, and pressure was gently applied until the embryo popped out of the seed into a clean container. A spatula was used to remove 30 embryos from the container. For the semi-automated squeezing extraction method, an automated extraction device as disclosed herein and depicted in FIGS. 21A-21B was set with its fingers in an open position. An individual kernel was positioned within the central receiving space defined between the open fingers and the support base of the extraction device. The kernel was positioned with its tip facing up, and the fingers of the extraction device were advanced to a gripping position to hold the kernel in the desired orientation. In a first trial, a scalpel was used to remove a portion of the tips of some kernels (without damaging the embryo) while the kernels were gripped by the fingers of the extraction device, while the tips of other kernels were removed prior to positioning of the kernels within the extraction device. In a second trial, the tips of all kernels were removed prior to positioning of the kernels within the extraction device. With each kernel gripped by the fingers of the extraction device, the fingers were radially advanced to apply an extraction force to the sides of the kernel. The extraction force was pulsed as necessary until the embryo exited the hole formed in the tip of the kernel. The fingers were then returned to the open position, and the extracted embryo was collected. This process was repeated until 30 embryos were extracted and collected. Embryo Plating Five petri dishes were filled with 605J Resting Media, and one petri dish was filled with 272X Resting Media. With the lid of each petri dish removed, 30 extracted embryos for each respective extraction method were evenly distributed on the resting media (to ensure adequate separation between the embryos) in a corresponding petri dish using a spatula. The embryos extracted using the hand extraction, high-pressure water, suction, and hand-squeezing methods were positioned within the 605J Resting Media, and the embryos extracted using the semi-automated squeezing method were positioned within the 272X Resting Media. The lids were replaced on each petri dish, and a marker was used to label each petri dish in accordance with the method used to extract the embryos within the petri dish and the position of the petri dish relative to the other petri dishes. e. Embryo Analysis Each embryo was analyzed under a microscope, and a score of the condition and quality of each embryo was independently recorded by two different analysts. The analysts looked for damage, defects, or other stress issues that may have an adverse effect on the growth and/or vigor of the embryo. Each embryo was rated on a general condition scale of 1-3, with 1=Excellent Condition, 2=Minor Defects or Damage (still capable of normal growth), and 3=Major Defects or Damage (unlikely to grow or grow normally). Any explanations or comments about each embryo's condition or quality were recorded. A digital record of each petri dish and its contents was prepared. f Results The embryo condition and quality scores are shown in the table provided as FIG. 26. As indicated in the table, the condition and quality of the embryos extracted by manual hand-squeezing and hand methods were very good and substantially the same. The condition and quality of the embryos extracted by the semi-automated extraction method were slightly below that of the embryos extracted by the manual hand-squeezing and hand extraction methods. The condition and quality of the embryos extracted by suction or high-pressure washing methods were poor compared to the hand-squeezing, hand, and semi-automated extraction methods.
