Example 76
2-Cyanoethyl (N-(O-(5-(3,4,6-O-triacetyl-2-acetylamino-2-deoxy-β-D-galactopyranosyl)oxy)butanoyl)-4-(((4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)oxy)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)methyl N,N-diisopropylamidophosphite 32i
Compound 28i (5.00 g, 4.97 mmol) and 2-cyanoethyl N,N,N',N'-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite (1.778 g, 5.90 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (25 mL). The solution was gently shaken with flame-dried molecular sieves 4 Å (1.5 g) for 1 h, cooled to −10° C., and treated with 1H-tetrazole in acetonitrile (0.45 M, 5.08 mL). Next day, the reaction mixture was quenched with triethylamine (0.5 mL) and diluted with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The product was extracted with DCM and purified on a silica gel column (5% Et3N, 0-1% MeOH in ethyl acetate) to give 32i (4.524 g, 75.4%) as a white solid foam.
