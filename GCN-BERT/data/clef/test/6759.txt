(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(1H-pyra zol-4-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl -6-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 24b (30 mg, 0.062 mmol) was dissolved in 3 mL of ethanol, then 2 mL of 1 M sodium hydroxide solution was added. After stirring for 2 hours, the reaction was stopped. A solution of 10% citric acid was added dropwise to adjust the pH to 6-7. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by thin-layer chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(1H-pyra zol-4-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid 24 (5 mg, yield 16.6%) as a yellow solid.
