Step 8: preparation of intermediate O5-benzyl O4-methyl 7-[allyloxy-(2-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl-amino]-6,7-dihydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate (6h)
To a solution of methyl 7-[allyloxy-(2-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl-amino]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-4-carboxylate (6g) (10.77 g, 23.70 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (230 mL) under inert atmosphere at -78Â°C were successively added DIPEA (8.3 mL, 47,4 mmol) and benzyl chloroformate (4.06 mL, 28,44 mmol). The mixture was then stirred at rt for 2 h 30. Water was added. The aqueous layer was extracted with DCM. The organic layers were combined, washed with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (DCM/acetone 100/0 to 90/10) to give 05-benzyl 04-methyl 7-[allyloxy-(2-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl-amino]-6,7-dihydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate (6h) (13.08 g, 22.22 mmol, 93%) as a yellow solid.
