FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to methods for diagnosing and predicting skin diseases, in particular for diagnosing and predicting cornification disorders such as ichthyosis in dogs. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Ichthyosis is a skin disease that is wide-spread among dogs of the Golden Retriever breed. The symptoms of ichthyosis include excessive scaling of large, variably pigmented flakes of skin in otherwise healthy dogs. The condition affects young dogs of either sex and is characterised by symmetrical, predominantly ventro-lateral scaling and hyperpigmentation of the trunk. An article reporting 50 cases of ichthyosis in dogs of Golden Retriever breed was first published in 2007 (Guaguere et al., 2007 Veterinary Dermatology. 18:382-383). A genetic aetiology, with single-trait autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, was then proposed in 2008 (Mauldin et al., 2008 Vet Pathol. 45:174-80; Cadiergues et al., 2008 Vet Dermatol. 19:120-9). Dermatological signs of Golden Retriever ichthyosis include a mild to moderate or severe generalised scaling with initially small to large whitish scales and progressively blackish scales. The ventral glabrous skin is hyperpigmented and rough, similar to sandpaper. Histopathological features are characterised by moderate to severe laminated or compact orthokeratotic epidermal hyperkeratosis composed of many keratin layers, without significant involvement of the stratum granulosum. Epidermis has a pleated appearance, and diffuse epidermal melanin pigmentation was observed in most cases. Keratinocytes from the basal and spinous layers seem to form agglutinated cell masses. Some keratinocytes with lipidic vacuoles are regularly visible in the stratum granulosum. Rete ridges of the epidermis give a pleated appearance resembling a garland (Guaguere et al., 2009, J Small Anim Pract. 50:227-35). Ultrastructural findings reveal laminated or compact keratin layers and numerous persistent corneodesmosomes within the stratum corneum. Melanosomes are found throughout the epidermis, as well as lipidic vacuoles within the stratum corneum. In summary, the histopathological and ultrastructural characteristics strongly suggest that Golden Retriever ichthyosis is a non epidermolytic, retention ichthyosis, caused by absence of corneodesmosomal degradation, transmitted through an autosomal recessive mode (Guaguere et al., 2009, J Small Anim Pract. 50:227-35). In addition to dogs of Golden Retriever breed, ichthyosis is also found in other dogs such as dogs of Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Irish Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, Collie, American Bulldog, American Staffordshire Terrier, Dobermann, Rottweiler, Australian Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Boston Terrier, West Highland White Terrier, Norfolk terrier and Jack Russel terrier breed. Ichthyosis is also found in human beings. In human, ichthyosis is a family of generalized skin disorders wherein the patients have dry, thickened, scaly or flaky skin. The severity of symptoms can vary enormously, from the mildest types such as ichthyosis vulgaris which may be mistaken for normal dry skin, up to life-threatening conditions such as harlequin type ichthyosis. Some types of ichthyoses occur in isolation without associated abnormalities (e.g. ichthyosis vulgaris, X-linked ichthyosis, bullous congenital, ichthyosiform erythroderma and ichthyosis lamellaris), while other types of ichthyoses are part of a syndrome that involves multiple organs (e.g. Netherton syndrome, Dorfman-Chanarin syndrome, Refsum's disease and Sjögren-Larsson syndrome). Apart from acquired ichthyosis due to a systemic disease such as e.g. leprosy, hypothyroidism, lymphoma or AIDS, all types of ichthyosis appear to be inherited diseases. For instance, lamellar ichthyosis, Refsum's disease and Sjögren-Larsson syndrome are autosomal recessive diseases. Genes at least partially associated with some types of human ichthyoses have been identified (see e.g. Akiyama and Shimizu. 2008 Exp Dermatol. 17:373-82; Oji. V, 2010, Hautarzt, 61(10):891-902). At present, a dozen of genes have been identified but all human cases are far from having a known molecular defect. In dogs, the genetic defect has been identified for 2 breeds segregating ichthyosis, namely the Norfolk terrier and the Jack Russel terrier. In the Norfolk terrier breed, a mutation in the Keratin 10 gene was identified in 2005 (Credille et al., 2005 Br J. Dermatol. 153:51-8.). In the Jack Russel terrier breed, a mutation in the TGM1 gene was found (Credille et al., Br J Dermatol. 2009 161:265-72 2009). However, the genes involved in Golden Retriever ichthyosis, in other affected dog breeds, and in several human familial or sporadic cases of ichthyosis, still remain to be identified. Currently, there is no method for predicting the risk of suffering from Golden Retriever ichthyosis and the diagnosis requires a skin biopsy and an histopathologic analysis. Such a method would be of great value not only in the field of veterinary medicine, but also in the field of human medicine. Among dogs, the Golden Retriever breed is a very popular breed with an estimated population of 8000 births per year in France. A method for predicting the risk of suffering from ichthyosis would allow selecting pups which are neither at risk of developing the disease, nor carrier of the disease. It would also allow selecting dogs suitable for reproduction. There is thus a need for a method for diagnosing ichthyosis and/or predicting the risk of suffering from ichthyosis or transmitting the disease to the progeny. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention arises from the finding that mutations in the PNPLA1 gene are involved in the development of ichthyosis. The inventors collected more than 300 blood and 30 tissue samples from Golden Retrievers, together with the pedigrees of the dogs. Forty Golden Retrievers, twenty of which suffered from ichthyosis and twenty of which were healthy, were selected for a genetic analysis. These forty dogs were as unrelated as possible, and have all had a histopathologic diagnosis according to the criteria set forth in Guaguere et al. (2009, J Small Anim Pract. 50:227-35). The DNA of these dogs was extracted and genotyped using the canine Affymetrix SNP chips. A genetic association study was carried out. It was found that a region of 7 megabases located on chromosome 12, and which comprised 217 genes, was associated with ichthyosis. Based on the putative function of these genes, three candidate genes were selected for further analysis. One of these candidate genes corresponded to the Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 1 (PNPLA1) gene. This gene belongs to the adiponutrin gene family and is not well characterized. Proteins of the adiponutrin family are believed to have both lipolytic and lipogenic properties (Johansson et al., 2009, PLoS One. 4:e5327). The inventors identified one mutation in the PNPLA1 gene which perfectly segregated with ichthyosis. This mutation is a replacement of three nucleotides (namely nucleotides 1445 to 1447 of SEQ ID NO: 1) with eight nucleotides consisting of TACTACTA. This mutation leads to the presence of a premature stop codon, and consequently to the synthesis of a truncated protein which is assumed to be biologically inactive or to harbour an activity which is different of its normal biological activity. The PNLPA1 gene of 100 Golden Retrievers suffering from ichthyosis was sequenced, and all of them comprised a mutation in both alleles of the PNPLA1 gene. The PNLPA1 gene of 100 healthy Golden Retrievers was also sequenced. 18 of them comprised two wild-type alleles of the PNPLA1 gene, whereas 82 of them comprised a mutation in only one of the two alleles of the PNPLA1 gene, the other allele being a wild-type allele. The inventors have thus found that Golden Retrievers suffering from ichthyosis displayed a mutation in both alleles of the PNPLA1 gene, whereas healthy Golden Retrievers displayed either two wild-type alleles of the PNPLA1 gene, or one wild-type allele together with one mutated allele. Since ichthyosis is known to be a genetic disease with single-trait autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, this result shows that PNPLA1 is the gene that causes ichthyosis in Golden Retrievers. In addition, the inventors have shown that PNPLA1 is specifically expressed in skin and to a lower extent in the brain and the intestine, and that its biological function is relevant for the disease. This gene was not previously known as being involved in skin diseases. Therefore, the inventors have identified a new gene responsible for the development of ichthyosis, namely PNPLA1. Method of Diagnosing and/or Predicting a Skin Disease or a Metabolic Disease The present invention thus relates to the use of at least one genetic variation in the PNPLA1 gene as a marker for diagnosing whether a subject suffers from or is at risk of suffering from a skin disease or a metabolic disease. More specifically, the invention is directed to an in vitro method for diagnosing and/or predicting a skin disease or a metabolic disease in a subject, comprising or consisting of the step of determining the presence or the absence of a genetic variation in the Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 1 (PNPLA1) gene sequence in a biological sample from said subject, as compared with the PNPLA1 gene sequence of a healthy non-carrier subject, wherein the presence of said genetic variation indicates that said subject suffers from or is at risk of suffering from said skin disease or metabolic disease, or is at risk of transmitting said disease to its progeny. The method may further comprise, before the step of determining, the step of obtaining or providing a biological sample from said subject. In the context of the invention, a genetic variation may be homozygous or heterozygous. A homozygous genetic variation means that the same genetic variation is present on both alleles of the gene carrying said genetic variation. A heterozygous genetic variation means on the contrary that said genetic variation is only present on one allele of the gene carrying said genetic variation. In the case of an autosomal recessive disease such as e.g. inherited ichthyosis, the presence of said genetic variation in both alleles of said PNPLA1 gene indicates that said subject suffers from or is at risk of suffering from said skin disease or metabolic disease. Conversely, the presence of said genetic variation in only one of the two alleles of said PNPLA1 gene indicates that said subject is a healthy carrier of said skin disease or metabolic disease. The absence of said genetic variation indicates that said subject is a healthy non-carrier of said skin disease or metabolic disease. an in vitro method for diagnosing and/or predicting a skin disease or a metabolic disease in a subject, comprising or consisting of determining the presence or the absence of a homozygous genetic variation in the Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 1 (PNPLA1) gene sequence in a biological sample from said subject, as compared with the PNPLA1 gene sequence of a healthy non-carrier subject, wherein the presence of said homozygous genetic variation indicates that said subject suffers from or is at risk of suffering from said skin disease or metabolic disease;an in vitro method for identifying a subject which is healthy carrier of a skin disease or a metabolic disease, comprising or consisting of determining the presence or absence of an heterozygous genetic variation in the PNPLA1 gene sequence in a biological sample from said subject, as compared with the PNPLA1 gene sequence of a healthy non-carrier subject, wherein the presence of said heterozygous genetic variation indicates that said subject is a healthy carrier of said skin disease or metabolic disease; andan in vitro method for identifying a subject which is healthy non-carrier of a skin disease or a metabolic disease, comprising or consisting of determining the presence or absence of an heterozygous genetic variation in the PNPLA1 gene sequence in a biological sample from said subject, as compared with the PNPLA1 gene sequence of a healthy non-carrier subject, wherein the absence of said heterozygous genetic variation indicates that said subject is a healthy non-carrier of said skin disease or metabolic disease. In the frame of the present invention, the “subject” is a mammal such as e.g. a dog or a human being. The subject can for example be a dog of Golden Retriever breed or of Golden Retriever type. Indeed, Golden Retrievers are particularly susceptible to ichthyosis. As used herein, the term “Golden Retriever” refers to a dog belonging to the breed described in the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standard no 111 (published on Jun. 24, 1987 and updated on Jan. 29, 1999). Golden retrievers are classified under group 8, section 1, of the FCI classification. As used herein, the term “Golden Retriever type” refers to a dog without pedigree having at least one Golden Retriever in his parents or grand-parents. Ichthyosis has also been found in dogs of other breeds than of Golden Retriever breed, including dogs of the following breeds: Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (FCI standards Nos. 128 and 136), Irish Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier (FCI standard No. 40), Collies (as used herein, this term includes the Bearded Collie, FCI standard No. 271; the Border Collie, FCI standard No. 297; the Collie Rough, FCI standard No. 156; and the Collie Smooth, FCI standard No. 296), American Bulldog (breed registry held by the American Bulldog Association), American Staffordshire Terrier (FCI standard No. 286), Dobermann (FCI standard No. 143), Rottweiler (FCI standard No. 147), Australian Terrier (FCI standard No. 8), Manchester Terrier (FCI standard No. 71), Boston Terrier (FCI standard No. 140) and West Highland White Terrier (FCI standard No. 85), Pomeranian dog, Griffon (as used herein, this term includes Grand Griffon Vendeen, FCI standard No. 282; Medium Griffon Vendeen, FCI standard No. 19; Blue Gascony Griffon, FCI standard No. 32; Fawn Brittany Griffon, FCI standard No. 66; Griffon nivernais, FCI standard No. 17; French wire-haired Korthals Pointing Griffon, FCI standard No. 107; Belgian Griffon, FCI standard No. 81; Brussels Griffon, FCI standard No. 80; and Small Brabant Griffon, FCI standard No. 82). Therefore, the subject can for example be a dog of any breed. In particular, the subject can be a dog of any of the above breeds, or a dog without pedigree having at least one of the above breeds in his parents or grand-parents. In addition, dogs of Golden Retriever breed are sometimes crossed with dogs of Labrador Retriever breed (FCI standard No. 122) or of other retriever breeds such as Curly Coated Retriever (FCI standard No. 110) and Cheasapeake Bay Retriever (FCI standard No. 263). Therefore, the subject can also be a dog of retriever breed (preferably of Labrador Retriever breed), or a dog without pedigree having at least one dog of retriever breed (preferably of Labrador Retriever breed) in his parents or grand-parents. As used herein, the term “skin disease” refers to any type of inherited dermatologic disease involving the skin. The skin disease preferably corresponds to a cornification disorder. Cornification disorders are a group of diseases well known to the one skilled in the art (for a review, see Oji. V, 2010, Hautarzt, 61(10):891-902). In the context of the present invention, the term “cornification disorder” includes diseases such as ichthyosis (including e.g. lamellar ichthyosis and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis), psoriasis, hyperkeratosis and eczema. Such a cornification disorder is preferably ichthyosis. In a preferred embodiment, the skin disease is a form of ichthyosis that is found in dogs (especially in Golden Retrievers). The ichthyosis may also be a form of ichthyosis that is found in human beings. In human, there are many different types of inherited ichthyoses that are classified according to clinical and genetic criteria (see e.g. Bale and DiGiovanna, 1997, Adv Dermatol. 12:99-114; Oji. V, 2010, Hautarzt, 61(10):891-902). The ichthyosis may be an ichthyosis occurring in isolation such as ichthyosis vulgaris, X-linked ichthyosis, bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (also known as epidermolytic hyperkeratosis), nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, ichthyosis lamellaris, Harlequin type ichthyosis, Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens, Ichthyosis hystrix and Carvajal syndrome. Alternatively, the ichthyosis may be part of a syndrome that involves multiple organs such as Netherton syndrome, Dorfman-Chanarin syndrome, Refsum's disease, Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, CHILD syndrome, Conradi-Hünermann syndrome, Darier's disease, erythrokeratodermia variabilis, ichthyosis follicularis, keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome, Rud syndrome and trichothiodystrophy. As used herein the term “PNPLA1 gene” refers to the PNPLA1 gene (including the 5′ regulatory region, the promoter, the introns, the exons and the 3′ regulatory region). As known to one skilled in the art, a gene includes both transcribed and untranscribed regions. The transcribed region may include introns, which are spliced out of the mRNA, and 5′- and 3′-untranslated (UTR) sequences along with the protein coding sequences (exons). Accordingly, as used herein, the genomic sequence of the PNPLA1 gene contains 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences, introns and exons. The genomic sequence of the dog PNPLA1 gene is represented herein by SEQ ID NO: 5. As used herein, the term “PNPLA1 cDNA” refers to the coding sequence of the PNPLA1 gene lacking introns. As known to one skilled in the art, several different cDNAs may be transcribed from a given gene, depending on alternative splicing. The term PNPLA1 cDNA is meant to encompass all alternative splice variants. The dog PNPLA1 cDNA encompasses for example the cDNAs of sequence SEQ ID Nos. 1 and 3, which are transcribed in skin. The terms “PNPLA1 gene” and “PNPLA1 cDNA” encompass genes and cDNAs of any mammalian origin. Mammalian PNPLA1 genes and cDNAs are well-known to the skilled in the art and include, e.g., those of Homo sapiens (GeneID: 285848, chromosome 6; Location 6p21.31), Pan troglodytes (GeneID: 471991, chromosome 6), Bos Taurus (GeneID: 786, chromosome 23), Equus caballus (GeneID: 100063661, chromosome 20), Mus musculus (GeneID: 433091, chromosome 17, Location: 17 A3.3) and Rattus norvegicus (GeneID: 361812, chromosome 20, Location: 20p12). More specifically, the sequence of the human PNPLA1 gene is shown on NCBI accession No. NC—000006.11 (36210945 . . . 36276372). In the context of the present invention, the terms “genetic variation”, “polymorphism” and “mutation” are used indifferently and contemplate single nucleotide substitutions, insertions, deletions and substitutions of one or more nucleotides, repetitive sequences (such as microsatellites), and the total or partial absence of genes. The genetic variation according to the invention may for example correspond to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The term “single nucleotide polymorphism” in the context of the present invention includes single base nucleotide substitutions, deletions or insertions. The SNP may be, e.g., a biallelic marker. The genetic variation may for example correspond to a loss of function mutation, i.e. a mutation leading to partial or complete loss of the biological activity of the polypeptide encoded by the mutated gene. In a specific embodiment of the in vitro method for diagnosing and/or predicting a skin disease or a metabolic disease in a subject according to the invention, genetic variation in the PNPLA1 gene sequence leads either to a lack of synthesis of PNPLA1 protein, or to the synthesis of a non-functional PNPLA1 protein. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the subject is a dog. Further, in a particularly preferred embodiment, the genetic variation is a replacement, in the dog PNPLA1 gene, of the nucleotides at position 1445 to position 1447 of SEQ ID NO: 1 with eight nucleotides consisting of TACTACTA (see FIG. 1A). In order to make the reading easier, the sequence of a dog PNPLA1 gene comprising a replacement of nucleotides 1445 to 1447 of SEQ ID NO: 1 with eight nucleotides consisting of TACTACTA will be called “del3ins8 allele”. The del3ins8 mutation is located within the eighth exon of the PNPLA1 gene. As defined above, the cDNA sequence of the PNPLA1 gene consists of the exons of the genomic sequence. Accordingly, a determined nucleotide position of the cDNA sequence corresponds to a determined position of the genomic sequence. In the context of the invention, the nucleotides at position 1445 to 1447 of the PNPLA1 cDNA sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 correspond to the nucleotides at position 40019 to 40021 of the PNPLA1 gene sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5. As known from one skilled in the art, introns of a gene may display numerous polymorphisms between subjects. Accordingly, a determined nucleotide position of the cDNA sequence of a gene may not correspond exactly to the same nucleotide position of the genomic sequence of the gene from a subject to another. Such a correspondence is nevertheless easily determined by one skilled in the art. In a particular embodiment, said genetic variation is determined on the transcript or the antisens strand of the PNPLA1 gene. As known from one skilled in the art, the sequence of the antisens strand of a gene is complementary to the sequence of the coding strand. This coding strand is transcribed in RNA, which may be spliced to form mRNA. The sequence of said mRNA is complementary to the sequence corresponding to the juxtaposition of the exons sequences contained in the coding strand. Accordingly, in the context of the invention, the del3ins8 allele as defined above corresponds to the presence of a nucleotide sequence consisting of TAGTAGTA on the antisense strand sequence of the PNPLA1 gene. As used herein, the term “diagnosing” includes determining, monitoring, confirming, subclassifying and predicting a disease, disorder, complication, or risk in a subject. As used herein, the term “predicting” refers to making a finding that a subject has a significantly enhanced probability of developing a disease. The methods according to the invention may be carried out either on biological samples obtained after birth of the subject being diagnosed, or on biological samples obtained from an embryo in the frame of a pre-natal diagnostic test. In the context of the invention, the term “healthy non-carrier” refers to a subject that is not and will not be affected by a disease and that will never transmit the disease to its progeny. Typically, according to the invention, a dog which is healthy non-carrier of ichthyosis is homozygous for the wild-type allele of the PNPLA1 gene. In particular, its genome does not comprise any copy of the del3ins8 allele of the PNPLA1 gene. In the context of the invention, the term “healthy carrier” refers to a subject that can transmit the disease to its progeny but which does not develop the disease. Typically, according to the invention, a dog which is healthy carrier of Ichthyosis only carries one del3ins8 allele. As ichthyosis is an autosomal recessive disease, said dog will not develop the disease. However, it has one chance on two to transmit the allele displaying the genetic variation to its progeny. Accordingly, if the progeny also receives an allele displaying the genetic variation from the other parent, which can either be a healthy carrier of ichthyosis or homozygous for the del3ins8 allele, said progeny will be affected by ichthyosis. As used herein, the term “biological sample” means a substance of biological origin. In particular the biological sample comprises DNAs, RNAs and/or proteins from the subject to be diagnosed. Examples of biological samples include but are not limited to blood and components thereof such as plasma and subpopulations of blood cells, serum, saliva, mouth epithelial cells, and organs or tissues such as skin, intestine, brain, kidney, liver, heart and lung. Numerous methods allowing determining the presence of a genetic variation in a biological sample are well known from the one skilled in the art. These methods include, without being limited to, sequencing (e.g. automated sequencing, microsequencing and pyrosequencing), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGCE), temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE), hybridization methods with DNA probes specific of said genetic variation (e.g. comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), matrix-CGH, array-CGH, oligonucleotide arrays and representational oligonucleotide microarray (ROMA)), high-throughput technologies for genotyping (for example using Affymetrix SNP chips), and amplification methods such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequencing, microsequencing, pyrosequencing or RFLP. The presence of a genetic variation can also be determined at the protein level, e.g. by an ELISA assay carried out with an antibody specifically detecting the mutated protein. Polynucleotides, Probes, Primers, Polypeptides, Antibodies and Uses Thereof The inventors of the present invention have identified the exon/intron boundaries of the dog PNPLA1 gene (SEQ ID NO: 5), which were differently annotated in the two public sequence databases UCSC and Ensembl. As a consequence, they have identified the correct sequence of the dog PNPLA1 cDNA (SEQ ID NO: 1) as expressed in skin and of the corresponding dog PNPLA1 protein (SEQ ID NO: 2). The inventors have also identified a mutant allele of the PNPLA1 gene, namely the del3ins8 allele (SEQ ID Nos: 3 and 4). Finally, the inventors have identified the biological function of the PNPLA1 protein, i.e., it avoids excessive scaling of the skin and allows a perfect lipidic balance in the skin. Therefore, the present invention is directed to: a) an isolated polynucleotide comprising or consisting of a sequence at least 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% identical to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1;b) an isolated polynucleotide comprising or consisting of a sequence at least 80, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% identical to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, wherein said polynucleotide comprises nucleotides 1445 to 1452, 1444 to 1452, 1444 to 1453, 1443 to 1455, 1440 to 1457 or 1435 to 1462 of SEQ ID NO: 3;c) an isolated polynucleotide comprising or consisting of a sequence complementary to the sequence of (a) or (b).d) an isolated polynucleotide comprising or consisting of at least, at most and/or about 12, 15, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 1600 or 1700 consecutive nucleotides of the polynucleotide of (a), (b) or (c);e) an isolated polypeptide comprising or consisting of a sequence at least 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% identical to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2;f) an isolated polypeptide comprising or consisting of a sequence at least 80, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% identical to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, wherein said polypeptide comprises amino acids 482 to 491 of SEQ ID NO: 4; andg) an isolated polypeptide comprising or consisting of at least, at most and/or about 15, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 or 550 consecutive amino acids of the polypeptide of (e) or (f). Such polynucleotides and polypeptides can easily be obtained by the skilled in the art. The polynucleotides according to the invention can for example be obtained by cloning the PNPLA1 gene or cDNA using suitable primers. The polynucleotide can then be cloned into a vector, preferably into an expression vector. The expression vector may then be introduced into a host cell in order to produce the polypeptide according to the invention. By a polynucleotide having a sequence at least, for example, 95% “identical” to a query sequence of the present invention, it is intended that the sequence of the polynucleotide is identical to the query sequence except that the sequence may include up to five nucleotide alterations per each 100 nucleotides of the query sequence. In other words, to obtain a polynucleotide having a sequence at least 95% identical to a query sequence, up to 5% (5 of 100) of the nucleotides of the sequence may be inserted, deleted, or substituted with another nucleotide. In other terms, the sequences should be compared on their entire length (i.e. by preparing a global alignment). For example, a first polynucleotide of 100 nt that is comprised within a second polynucleotide of 200 nt is 50% identical to said second polynucleotide. The needle program, which uses the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970 J. Mol. Biol. 48:443-453) to find the optimum alignment (including gaps) of two sequences when considering their entire length, may for example be used. Preferably, the percentage of identity in accordance with the invention is calculated using the needle program with a “Gap open” parameter equal to 10.0, a “Gap Extend” parameter equal to 0.5, and a Blosum 62 matrix. The needle program is for example available on the ebi.ac.uk World Wide Web site. “Isolated polynucleotide” refers herein to both RNA and DNA, including cDNA, genomic DNA, and synthetic DNA. Polynucleotides can have any three-dimensional structure. A polynucleotide can be double-stranded or single-stranded (i.e., a sense strand or an antisense strand). Non-limiting examples of polynucleotides include genes, gene fragments, exons, introns, messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA, siRNA, micro-RNA, ribozymes, cDNA, recombinant polynucleotides, and branched polynucleotides. A polynucleotide may contain unconventional or modified nucleotides. Isolated polynucleotides according to the invention may be purified or recombinant. The polynucleotides, primers and probes according to the invention may be of any length, e.g. at least, at most and/or about 12, 15, 18, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 or 1000 nucleotides long. More specifically, they may comprise or consist of a contiguous span of the PNPLA1 gene of at least, at most and/or about 12, 15, 18, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 or 1000 nucleotides. Preferably, primers and probes according to the invention consist of at least 18 nucleotides. Fragments of the PNPLA1 gene or of the PNPLA1 cDNA are useful as primers or probes for detecting a genetic variation in the PNPLA1 gene, e.g. by sequencing, hybridization methods and/or amplification methods. Therefore, the invention pertains to the use of an isolated polynucleotide comprising or consisting of a contiguous span of at least 12 nucleotides of a PNPLA1 gene or of a PNPLA1 cDNA for diagnosing and/or predicting a skin disease or a metabolic disease in a subject, and/or for identifying a subject which is a healthy carrier or a healthy non-carrier of said disease. When a dog is to be diagnosed, said isolated polynucleotide may for example comprise or consist of a contiguous span of at least 12 nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 5 or sequences complementary thereto. A preferred embodiment of the invention is directed to an isolated probe or primer suitable for specifically identifying and/or amplifying the del3ins8 mutation comprising or consisting of a contiguous span of at least 12 nucleotides of a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 5 and sequences complementary thereto, wherein said contiguous span comprises nucleotide positions 1445 to 1447 of SEQ ID NO: 1, nucleotide positions 1445 to 1452 of SEQ ID NO: 3, or nucleotide positions complementary thereto. For the sake of completeness, when the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 is used as a reference, said contiguous span comprises nucleotide positions 40019 to 40021 of SEQ ID NO: 5, or nucleotide positions complementary thereto. As used herein, a “probe” refers to an oligonucleotide capable of binding in a base-specific manner to a complementary strand of polynucleotide. Isolated probes according to the invention may be purified or recombinant. They may be labelled with a detectable moiety, i.e. a moiety capable of generating a detectable signal, such as a radioactive, calorimetric, fluorescent, chemiluminescent or electrochemiluminescent signal. Numerous such detectable moieties are known in the art. By way of example, the moiety may be a radioactive compound or a detectable enzyme (e.g., horseradish peroxidase). The probe may for example correspond to a TaqMan© probe. As used herein, the term “primer” refers to an oligonucleotide which is capable of annealing to a target sequence and serving as a point of initiation of DNA synthesis under conditions suitable for amplification of the primer extension product which is complementary to said target sequence. The primer is preferably single stranded for maximum efficiency in amplification. Preferably, the primer is an oligodeoxyribonucleotide. The length of the primer depends on several factors, including temperature and sequence of the primer, but must be long enough to initiate the synthesis of amplification products. Preferably the primer is from 10 to 35 nucleotides in length. A primer can further contain additional features which allow for detection, immobilization, or manipulation of the amplified product. The primer may furthermore comprise covalently-bound fluorescent dyes, which confer specific fluorescence properties to the hybrid consisting of the primer and the target-sequence or non covalently-bound fluorescent dyes which can interact with the double-stranded DNA/RNA to change the fluorescence properties. Fluorescent dyes which can be used are for example SYBR-green or ethidium bromide. Another preferred embodiment of the invention is directed to an isolated primer comprising or consisting of: a contiguous span of at least 12 nucleotides of a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 5, wherein the 3′ end of said primer is located at, or at most 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 nucleotide(s) upstream of the location of the del3ins8 mutation;a contiguous span of at least 12 nucleotides of a sequence selected from the group of complementary sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 5, wherein the 3′ end of said primer is located at, or at most 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 nucleotide(s) upstream of the location of the del3ins8 mutation. In other terms, the 3′ end of said primer is located at, or at most 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 nucleotide(s) upstream of, a nucleotide position selected from the group consisting of nucleotide position 1445 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3, nucleotide position 1447 of SEQ ID NO:1, nucleotide position 1452 of SEQ ID NO: 3, and nucleotide positions complementary thereto. For the sake of completeness, when the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 is used as a reference, the 3′ end of said primer is located at, or at most 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 nucleotide(s) upstream of, nucleotide position 40 019 or nucleotide position 40 021 of SEQ ID NO: 5, and nucleotide positions complementary thereto. Therefore, the invention is directed to an isolated primer comprising: a contiguous span of at least 18 nucleotides of a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 5, wherein the 3′ end of said primer is located at, or at most 10 nucleotides upstream of, a nucleotide position selected from the group consisting of nucleotide position 1445 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3, nucleotide position 1447 of SEQ ID NO:1, nucleotide position 1452 of SEQ ID NO: 3; ora contiguous span of at least 18 nucleotides of a sequence selected from the group of complementary sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 5, wherein the 3′ end of said primer is located at, or at most 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 nucleotide(s) upstream of and nucleotide positions complementary to nucleotide position 1445 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3, nucleotide position 1447 of SEQ ID NO:1, nucleotide position 1452 of SEQ ID NO: 3. Still another preferred embodiment of the invention is directed to a pair of primers suitable for amplifying the del3ins8 mutation comprising or consisting of a first and a second primer, each comprising or consisting of a contiguous span of at least 12 nucleotides of a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 5 and sequences complementary thereto, wherein: a) said first primer hybridizes to a first DNA strand of the PNPLA1 gene;b) said second primer hybridizes to the strand complementary to said first DNA strand of the PNPLA1 gene; andc) the 3′ ends of said first and second primers are located within 1000, 500, 250, 100 or 50 nucleotides of the location of the del3ins8 mutation. In other terms, the 3′ ends of said first and second primers are located within 1000, 500, 250, 100 or 50 nucleotides of nucleotides positions 1445 to 1447 of SEQ ID NO: 1, of nucleotides positions 1445 to 1452 of SEQ ID NO: 3, or of nucleotide positions complementary thereto. For the sake of completeness, when the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 is used as a reference, the 3′ ends of said first and second primers are located within 1000, 500, 250, 100 or 50 nucleotides of nucleotide positions 40019 to 40021 of SEQ ID NO: 5, or of nucleotide positions complementary thereto. Examples of pairs of primers according to the invention are provided in Example 1, and include the pairs of primers of SEQ ID Nos. 26 and 27, SEQ ID Nos. 43 and 44, SEQ ID Nos. 45 and 46, and SEQ ID Nos. 47 and 48, which allow detecting the presence or the absence of the del3ins8 mutation. The polynucleotides, the probes, the primers and the pairs of primers according to the invention can be used in the methods of diagnosing and/or predicting a skin disease or a metabolic disease described herein, and/or in the methods for identifying a subject which is healthy carrier or a healthy non-carrier of such a disease. A genetic variation in the PNPLA1 gene can not only be detected at the DNA or RNA level, but also at the protein level, for example using an antibody specifically binding to the mutated PNPLA1 protein. Thus the invention provides an isolated antibody specifically binding to a PNPLA1 polypeptide according to the invention, and to the use of such an antibody for diagnosing and/or predicting a skin disease or a metabolic disease in a subject, and/or for identifying a subject which is a healthy carrier or a healthy non-carrier of such a disease. As used herein, the term “specifically binding” has its common meaning in the art. More specifically, an antibody specifically binds to a PNPLA1 protein if the antibody is displaced by other competitive ligands specific for the PNPLA1 protein. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody according to the invention does not bind, or bind with a significantly lower affinity, to the PNPLA1 polypeptide shown in REFSEQ accession no XP—538884 (30, Aug. 2005). In a most preferred embodiment, the antibody according to the invention: specifically binds to a wild-type PNPLA1 polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, but does not bind, or bind with a significantly lower affinity, to a PNPLA1 polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 4 comprising the del3ins8 mutation; orspecifically binds to a PNPLA1 polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 4 comprising the del3ins8 mutation, but does not bind, or bind with a significantly lower affinity, to a wild-type PNPLA1 polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2. The above antibodies according to the invention may be polyclonal or monoclonal. The monoclonal antibodies may be obtained from hybridomas or correspond to recombinant antibodies (e.g. chimeric, humanized or fully dog or human antibodies). The antibodies according to the invention may further be labelled in order to allow their detection. Arrays and Kits The present invention also relates to an array for diagnosing and/or predicting a skin disease or a metabolic disease in a subject and/or for identifying a dog which is a healthy carrier or a healthy non-carrier of such a disease, wherein said array comprises polynucleotides and/or probes as defined above. As used herein, the term “array” refers to a set of genes, fragment of genes, oligonucleotides deposited on a support (glass slide, nylon membrane . . . ) with a high density. Numerous scientific publications about the preparation and the use of arrays are available. In a particular embodiment, the polynucleotides and/or probes as defined above are assembled on a same solid support, preferably a standardized support. Its size can vary according to the apparatuses used to detect the presence or absence of a genetic variation as defined above. Advantageously, the combination of polynucleotides and/or probes according to the invention is in form of a DNA matrix, comprising a support on which probes likely to hybridize to target sequences are deposed, preferably in a standardized way. The size of such supports varies according to the preparation and detection methods used. Such small supports are also referred to array. The present invention further relates to a kit for diagnosing and/or predicting a skin disease or a metabolic disease in a subject, and/or for identifying a subject which is a healthy carrier or a healthy non-carrier of such a disease, wherein said kit comprises means for detecting a genetic variation in the PNPLA1 gene sequence. Means for detecting a genetic variation in a gene sequence include the polynucleotides, primers, probes and antibodies described herein. Such means can be labeled with detectable compound such as fluorophores or radioactive compounds. For example, the probe or the antibody may be labeled with a detectable compound. Alternatively, when the kit comprises a antibody, the kit may further comprise a secondary antibody, labeled with a detectable compound, which binds to an unlabelled antibody specifically binding to the PNPLA1 protein. The means for detecting a genetic variation in the PNPLA1 gene sequence may also include reagents such as e.g. reaction buffers, hybridization buffers, washing buffers and/or enzymes. The means may be present, e.g., in vials or microtiter plates, or be attached to a solid support such as a microarray as can be the case for primers and probes. The kit may further comprise instructions regarding the diagnosis of a skin disease and/or a metabolic disease. In a preferred embodiment, the arrays and kits according to the invention allow detecting the del3ins8 mutation in a dog. Genotyping The present invention further relates to a method for genotyping a dog comprising or consisting of the steps of: a) obtaining or providing an isolated polynucleotide from a biological sample derived from said dog; andb) detecting whether the genome of said dog comprises a del3ins8 allele. The term “genotyping” a dog involves determining the specific allele or the specific nucleotide(s) carried by the dog. Preferably, said biological sample is derived from a single individual. It is preferred that the presence of a del3ins8 allele is detected for both copies of said the PNPLA1 gene present in the individual's genome. Any well-known method of genotyping may be used in the frame of the present invention. Such methods include methods such as e.g. conventional dot blot analyzes, single strand conformational polymorphism analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, heteroduplex analysis and mismatch cleavage detection. Another method for determining the identity of the nucleotide present at a particular polymorphic site employs a specialized exonuclease-resistant nucleotide derivative as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,656,127. Oligonucleotide microarrays or solid-phase capturable dideoxynucleotides and mass spectrometry may also be used. Preferred methods involve directly determining the identity of the nucleotide present at an allelic marker site by sequencing assay, enzyme-based mismatch detection assay, or hybridization assay. In a preferred embodiment, the method of genotyping of the invention further comprises the step of correlating the result of the genotyping steps with a risk of suffering from a skin disease or a metabolic disease. Therapeutic Uses It has been found that dogs bearing two copies of the del3ins8 allele, which leads to the synthesis of a truncated PNPLA1 polypeptide of only 491 amino acids, suffers from or are at risk of suffering from ichthyosis. Therefore, the absence of a functional PNPLA1 protein is believed to cause skin diseases. In addition, the inventors came to the conclusion that the absence of a functional PNPLA1 protein or an alteration of its biological activity may be involved in the development of metabolic diseases as well. The invention thus pertains to an isolated wild-type PNPLA1 polypeptide for use as a medicament, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising or consisting of a wild-type polypeptide and a physiologically acceptable carrier. More specifically, the invention pertains to an isolated wild-type PNPLA1 polypeptide for use in the treatment or prevention of a skin disease or a metabolic disease in a subject, and to methods for treating and/or preventing a skin disease or a metabolic disease comprising or consisting of the step of administering an effective amount of a wild-type PNPLA1 polypeptide to a subject in need thereof. By “wild-type PNPLA1 polypeptide” is meant a PNPLA1 polypeptide having biological activity. The biological activity of the PNPLA1 polypeptide is defined herein as being the ability to avoid excessive scaling of the skin. This biological activity is believed to be linked with the lipid hydrolase activity of the PNPLA1 protein. In addition, the region extending from position 480 to position 522 of SEQ ID NO: 2 appears to be crucial for the biological activity of the PNPLA1 protein. When a dog is to be treated, a wild-type PNPLA1 polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 may for example be used. When a human being is to be treated, isoform 1 shown in Swiss-Prot accession no Q8N8W4 (last modified Sep. 1, 2009. Version 49) may for example be used. Alternatively, derivatives thereof may also be used provided that: the derivative is capable of inhibiting and/or reducing scaling of the skin; and/orthe derivative exhibits lipid hydrolase activity; and/orthe sequence of the derivative comprises the region extending from position 480 to position 522 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (corresponding to amino acids 490 to 532 of isoform 1 of the human PNPLA1 protein shown in Swiss-Prot accession no Q8N8W4). The term “derivative” includes fragments, homologues, mutants and naturally-occurring variants such as allelic variants, splice variants or variants obtained through proteolytic processing. Derivatives may comprise mutations such as deletions, insertions and/or substitutions compared to the reference sequence. In case of substitutions, the substitution may correspond to a conservative substitution as indicated in the table below. By “treatment” is meant a therapeutic use (i.e. on a patient having a given disease) and by “preventing” is meant a prophylactic use (i.e. on an individual susceptible of developing a given disease). The term “treatment” not only includes treatment leading to complete cure of the diseases, but also treatments slowing down the progression of the disease. By “effective amount” is meant an amount sufficient to achieve a concentration of peptide which is capable of preventing, treating or slowing down the disease to be treated. Such concentrations can be routinely determined by those of skilled in the art. The amount of the compound actually administered will typically be determined by a physician or a veterinarian, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the subject, the severity of the subject's symptoms, and the like. It will also be appreciated by those of skilled in the art that the dosage may be dependent on the stability of the administered peptide. By “subject in need thereof” is meant an individual suffering from or susceptible of suffering from the skin disease to be treated or prevented. The individuals to be treated in the frame of the invention are preferably human beings or dogs. The invention also contemplates the use of a polynucleotide encoding a wild-type PNPLA1 polypeptide in the frame of e.g. a treatment of a skin disease or a metabolic disease by gene therapy. In this case, the polynucleotide is preferably present on an expression vector, on which the sequence coding for the peptide is placed under the control of expression signals (e.g. a promoter, a terminator and/or an enhancer) allowing its expression. The expression vector may for example correspond to a viral vector such as an adenoviral or a lentiviral vector. All references cited herein, including journal articles or abstracts, published patent applications, issued patents or any other references, are entirely incorporated by reference herein, including all data, tables, figures and text presented in the cited references. The invention will be further evaluated in view of the following examples and figures.

Example 2 Results Blood and tissue samples from 800 dogs, together with the accompanying pedigree when available, were collected by a network including the French National Veterinary Schools, the Liege Veterinary School, pathology laboratories and licensed veterinarians from France. Out of 300 Golden retrievers, DNA from 40 unrelated dogs (20 affected dogs and 20 non-affected dogs) was selected for further analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes of these blood and tissue samples. Genotype data were generated using the canine SNP Affymetrix chips for 49 658 SNPs. Genotypes were analyzed and p-values were calculated using the Plink software. It was found that a genomic region of about 9 megabases of canine chromosome 12 encompassed the best statistical p-value. An exhaustive analysis of this region revealed three candidate genes. Samples from 24 dogs (twelve affected dogs and twelve unaffected dogs) were used for sequencing all exons of these three candidate genes. One of these three candidate genes corresponded to the Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 1 (PNPLA1) gene. This gene is a poorly characterized gene, which belongs to the adiponutrin gene family. Proteins of the adiponutrin family are believed to have both lipolytic and lipogenic properties (Johansson et al., 2009, PLoS One. 4:e5327). The human PNPLA1 protein is annotated as being a putative lipid hydrolase (see e.g. Swiss-Prot accession no Q8N8W4). The sequencing of the PNPLA1 gene, carried out starting from cDNA prepared form healthy dog skin biopsies, allowed correcting the sequence of the PNPLA1 gene and of the PNPLA1 cDNA that are found in public databases (NCBI accession Nos. NC—006594.2 and XM—538884.2, Ensembl accession No. ENSCAFG00000001392 and ENSCAFT00000002155). The corrected sequence of the dog PNPLA1 gene, with corrected introns/exons boundaries corresponding to the boundaries found in the skin transcript, is shown as SEQ ID NO: 5. A mutation referred to as del3ins8 was identified in exon 8 of the corrected PNPLA1 gene sequence. This mutation, which is shown on FIG. 1A, is a deletion of three bases combined with an insertion of 8 bases. This mutation results in a frameshift and leads to the presence of a premature stop codon in the resulting coding sequence. As a consequence, the encoded protein lacks 74 amino acids at its C-terminal extremity (FIG. 1B). This mutation is located in a region that in well conserved between PNPLA1 proteins of different organisms (FIG. 1B). Moreover, it has been shown that mutations leading to a truncation of the C-terminal extremity of the closely related PNPLA2 protein are loss of function mutations (Fischer et al. 2007 Nat Genet. 39:28-30). Therefore, the del3ins8 mutation very likely corresponds to a loss of function mutation. In addition, as shown in SEQ ID NO: 5, there appears to exist two alternative exons 6. The first exon 6 (positions 35164 to 35748 of SEQ ID NO: 5) is predicted to lead to the synthesis of a protein of 565 amino acids (shown as SEQ ID NO: 1). The second exon 6 (positions 35164 to 35802 of SEQ ID NO: 5) is predicted to lead to the synthesis of a protein of 583 amino acids. Total RNA was extracted from tissue biopsy samples from an unaffected dog, and PCR reactions amplifying the PNPLA1 cDNA were performed on a series of 15 tissues. It was shown that PNPLA1 is highly expressed in skin. It was also slightly expressed in brain and in colon, although at a much lesser extent. No expression was found in the 12 other studied tissues (FIG. 2). Total RNA was further extracted from skin biopsy samples from unaffected and from affected dogs. PCR reactions amplifying the PNPLA1 cDNA were carried out. The mRNA was expressed in the skin of all dogs. The region comprising the del3ins8 mutation was sequenced. RNAs were extracted from skin (punch biopsie) for 15 dogs. The RNAs were retrotranscribed into cDNAs. The cDNAs were either sequenced or PCR amplified with del3ins8 mutation specific primers of SEQ ID Nos 45-46 and/or 47-48. In skin, the PNPLA1 mRNAs were found to comprise the first exon 6 (i.e. positions 35164 to 35748 of SEQ ID NO: 5), thereby leading to the synthesis of a PNPLA1 protein of SEQ ID NO: 2 or 4. Eleven dogs were confirmed to carry the del3ins8 mutation at the homozygous state. Two dogs were heterozygous. Two dogs were homozygous for the wild-type allele. Sequencing showed the presence of a homozygous mutated sequence in RNA extracted from tissues of affected dogs. Unaffected dogs were either homozygous for the normal sequence (healthy non-carriers dogs) or heterozygous (healthy carriers). This experiment thus confirmed that the mutation is found in the cDNA obtained from skin RNAs with a perfect concordance between the phenotype and the mutational status of the DNA and RNA. In summary, it has been found that: Golden Retrievers suffering from ichthyosis displayed the del3ins8 mutation in both alleles of the PNPLA1 gene, whereas healthy Golden Retrievers displayed either two wild-type alleles of the PNPLA1 gene, or one wild-type allele together with one mutated allele;The del3ins8 mutation results in the synthesis of a PNPLA1 protein lacking 74 amino acids at its C-terminal extremity. The del3ins8 mutation very likely corresponds to a loss of function mutation; andPNPLA1 is specifically expressed at high levels in the skin. Taken together, these results show that PNPLA1 is the gene that causes ichthyosis in Golden Retrievers. This finding is further corroborated by the fact that the PNPLA1 protein is annotated as being a lipid hydrolase (see e.g. Swiss-Prot accession no Q8N8W4), and that in human beings, many types of ichthyoses correspond to disorders of the lipid metabolism (Elias et al. 2008 J Lipid Res. 49:697-714). Moreover, CGI58 has been discovered mutated in human subjects affected with ichthyosis in the frame of the Dorfmann-Chanarin syndrome (Caux et al., 2004 Am J Med Genet A. 129A:214; Ben Selma et al., 2007 J Invest Dermatol. 127:2273-6). CGI58 positively regulates PNPLA2, a PNPLA1 paralog. Further, since PNPLA1 gene is almost exclusively expressed in the epidermis of the skin, more particularly in the keratinocytes, it is likely that lack of expression of PNPLA1, or expression of a non-functional PNPLA1, also triggers cornification disorders different from ichthyoses. In addition, the facts that: PNPLA1 belongs to the PNPLA family (“Patatin like phospholipase domain containing proteins” family), the members of which present a lipid hydrolase activity with different substrate specificities (Kienesberger et al., J Lipid Res. 2009; 50 Suppl:S63-8);PNPLA1 is slightly expressed in intestine; andGolden Retrievers, among which the del3ins8 mutation is very wide-spread, have a higher risk of becoming obese than many other dog breeds; further suggest that PNPLA1 may be involved in the development of metabolic diseases. 1. cDNA comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of: a) the sequence at least 93% identical to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein said cDNA comprises nucleotides 1445 to 1447 of SEQ ID NO: 1;b) the sequence at least 80% identical to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, wherein said cDNA comprises nucleotides 1444 to 1452 of SEQ ID NO: 3; andc) the sequence complementary to the sequence of (a) or (b). 2.
