Synthesis Imaging System Field of the Invention The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for imaging a sample using an array of two or more spatially-distinct sources, for example a fibre bundle with multiple fibre cores. The invention has particular applicability to endoscopic imaging, inspection and endoscopic medical or surgical procedures and multi-photon experiments. Background Fibre-based endoscopes are known, but typically have relied on multimode fibres and have used distal-end detection for calibration of the fibre optical-beam transport. Endoscopes using fibre bundles are also known, but typically use a proximity focus at the distal end and require the use of all fibres in the bundle within the imaging area. Summary of the invention According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an imaging system comprising a fibre with multiple monomode cores, a coherent radiation source for transmitting coherent radiation into the monomode cores and onto a target to be imaged, and a detector for detecting light transmitted through the fibre from the target. More specifically, according to the invention, there is provided an imaging apparatus comprising: an optical fibre with multiple monomode cores; a coherent radiation source for transmitting coherent radiation in sets of two or more monomode cores; a modulator for modulating the coherent radiation input to the individual monomode cores, each set of monomode cores being associated with a unique modulation, wherein radiation output from each pair of monomode cores forms an interference pattern on a target to be imaged, and each interference pattern is uniquely identifiable from its unique modulation as originating from a specific pair of cores; a detector for detecting radiation from the target, and an analyser for analysing the detected light and forming an image of the target. Coherent radiation propagated through the monomode fibre cores forms an interference pattern at a defined distance from the fibre distal end, which pattern can be used for imaging the target. In a preferred embodiment the coherent radiation interference pattern is used to stimulate fluorescence in a target, such as a sample or specimen, which is located at a defined distance from the fibre distal end. Using a fibre with multiple monomode cores and coherent radiation for imaging permits the use of well-defined Fourier modes for fluorescence image reconstruction, and implementation of adaptive imaging strategies. Radiation from the target may be transmitted to the detector via the optical fibre. The multiple monomode cores may be embedded in a cladding material. Collection of the specimen fluorescence may be achieved using the cladding. Using cladding modes to collect light from the target, for example fluorescence, effectively integrates the signal over the whole specimen area stimulated and means that the collection process is spectrally broadband. The optical fibre may include at least one multi-mode core and radiation from the target may be transmitted to the detector via said at least one multi-mode core. The monomode cores may be surrounded by cladding and radiation from the target may be transmitted to the detector via said cladding. The coherent radiation in the monomode cores is modulated either in phase (or, equivalently, through a frequency change), or in amplitude, or both. In a preferred embodiment the modulation is a phase modulation (equivalent to a frequency modulation) in such a manner that every pair of monomode fibre cores within the set of cores forms an interference pattern modulated with a unique temporal frequency. The multiple monomode core imaging system of the invention may be integrated into an endoscope. In this embodiment, typically the endoscope has an overall diameter of between one half and one mm. This means that at a specimen range of 2mm the solid angle of collection offered allows for reasonably efficient collection, equivalent to an f/4 or faster optical system. In a preferred embodiment the modulated sinusoidal interference pattern from each monomode fibre-core pair leads to modulated fluorescence. Integration of the fluorescence signal in the cladding modes or the multimode cores represents the detection of an appropriate Fourier mode of the specimen fluorescence distribution. The maximum modulation frequency difference between any pair of monomode fibre cores must be substantially less than the fluorescence lifetime associated with the specimen fluorescence induced by the modulated illumination. The modulation scheme may be such that separate monomode fibre cores produce sine and cosine illumination patterns required for delivering a specimen mage by Fourier analysis. One or more optical components may be arranged at the fibre distal end. The one or more optical elements may comprise a GRIN lens or a beam-steering system such as prisms over the fibre-cores at the distal end. The interference pattern may be produced at the specimen through the use of a diffractive optical element or a lens array. The target may be positioned approximately on the surface of the diffractive element or lens array. From a multi-core fibre several sets of fibre cores could be selected for imaging at different ranges from the fibre distal end by using different micro-optical elements (e.g. prisms) to ensure that the beams from the different arrays overlap at different distances from the fibre distal end. For example, imaging may occur on multiple image planes, for example the -1 , 0 or +1 image planes through selective signal processing of fibre cores in the fibre bundle. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided an imaging apparatus comprising: two or more spatially-distinct sources arranged to illuminate the same area of a target with coherent radiation; a modulator for modulating the relative phase and/or amplitude of radiation emanating from the two or more spatially-distinct sources; a detector for detecting radiation from the target that is integrated over a solid angle and a signal processor for analysing the detected radiation and forming an image of the target. Preferably, multiple pairs of spatially-distinct sources are provided and each pair is associated with a unique modulation, wherein radiation output from each pair of spatially-distinct sources forms an interference pattern on a target to be imaged, and each interference pattern is uniquely identifiable from its unique modulation as originating from a specific pair of spatially-distinct sources. Modulation of the relative phases and amplitudes of the spatially-distinct sources is such that the signal processor can distinguish between signals from each pair of sources and/or between two or more measurements from each pair of sources in which the relative phase has been altered. The spatially-distinct sources may comprise monomode optical fibre cores. The detector may collect the radiation from the target in a multi-mode optical system or a cladding mode of an optical fibre. Radiation from the target may be transported to a photon-sensitive detector via the multi-mode system or fibre cladding. The target radiation may be fluorescence generated in response to stimulating radiation delivered to the target through spatially-distinct sources. The radiation detected may be radiation scattered by the target. The radiation from the spatially-distinct sources may overlap at a defined distance from the sources. This overlapping may be implemented using a focussing device or element. The radiation from the spatially-distinct sources may be made to overlap at a defined distance from the array of sources using one or more beam-steering devices. The detector may collect radiation from the target travelling in directions other than the solid angle containing the spatially-distinct sources. The detector may have two or more detecting elements that collect radiation from the target over different angular ranges. A GRIN lens may be provided and positioned so that light transmitted through the fibre cores is focussed at a defined position on the GRIN distal end or beyond that position and within the specimen volume. An interference pattern may be formed at the specimen through the use of a diffractive optical element or a lens array. The target may be positioned approximately on the surface of the diffractive element or lens array. Imaging may occur on multiple image planes, for example the -1 , 0 or +1 image planes through selective signal processing of fibre cores in the fibre bundle. According to yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus for producing a temporally modulated illumination pattern on a specimen at a defined distance from the distal end of the apparatus and collecting the fluorescent radiation from the specimen, comprising: an optical fibre arranged to have multiple monomode fibre cores for transport of the illuminating radiation from the fibre proximate end to the fibre distal end; means for modulating the phase and/or amplitude of the radiation in each monomode core at the fibre proximate end in such a way as to ensure that the modulation scheme for the radiation used to illuminate the specimen, provides a unique means for the identification of the interference pattern produced by the radiation illuminating the specimen through every monomode fibre pair used to illuminate the specimen; means to trap fluorescence from the specimen in the fibre cladding modes for transport to the fibre proximate end; means at the fibre proximate end to detect the integrated cladding mode intensity signal at a rate above the Nyquist rate for the illumination modulation scheme; signal processing means to decode the fluorescence signal produced by the modulated specimen illumination delivered through each monomode fibre core pair; computing means to allocate the demodulated signal from each fibre-core pair to an appropriate position in spatial frequency and to synthesis an image of the specimen fluorescence distribution by means of a Fourier transform.

Detailed description of the Drawings Figure 1 shows an endoscopy imaging system. This has a fibre with multiple monomode cores 1 , each surrounded by fibre cladding 2, and a coherent radiation source (not shown), for example a laser for coupling light into the monomode cores 1 . Coherent radiation emitted from the array of monomode cores 1 forms an interference pattern at the fibre distal end. The radiation from the many fibre cores is directed by optical micro-elements 7 to overlap on a specimen 3 at a defined distance from the fibre distal end. Each core illuminates the same area of the specimen 3. Fluorescence stimulated by the short-wave interference pattern illuminating the specimen 3 is collected by the fibre cladding 2. The fluorescence is transported by the cladding 2 or gallery modes of the fibre to the fibre proximate end. Using cladding modes to collect the fluorescence effectively integrates the signal over the specimen area stimulated, so that the collection process is spectrally broadband. A detector (not shown), for example a single, fast photo-sensitive pixel, measures the integrated intensity signal in the cladding modes as a function of time. The output from the detector is processed using a suitable signal processor to form an image of the specimen 3. To cause rapid, controlled movement of the interference pattern in the illumination, radiation in the monomode fibre cores producing the interferometric specimen illumination pattern are phase and/or amplitude modulated. The phase modulation of each monomode fibre core is arranged such that each pair of monomode fibre cores produces an interference pattern, which may be uniquely identified by its temporal frequency or by the sequence with which measurements are made. Each measured frequency in the integrated cladding mode signal is associated with a unique pair of points in the spatial frequency coverage achieved providing both sine and cosine components of that spatial frequency. When Fourier transformed in a computer this spatial frequency coverage leads to an image point spread function with a well-defined high-resolution spike surrounded by low-amplitude sidelobes. This forms a high- resolution image of the specimen fluorescence structure. The fluorescence radiation collected through the cladding modes or multimode cores is detected at the proximate end of the fibre, where the unique frequency that characterises every pair of monomode fibre cores is used to identify the fluorescence signal produced by the interference pattern formed between the coherent radiation propagated through that pair of monomode cores. Interference between each pair of coherent monomode fibre cores is a sinusoidal pattern of period and orientation dependent on the separation of the monomode fibre cores concerned. The relative phase modulation between the pair of monomode fibre cores concerned determines the phase of the interference pattern (and thus the balance of sine and cosine terms needed to describe the interference pattern). An image of the spatial distribution of fluorescence in the specimen is synthesised by Fourier transformation of the demodulated signal detected at the proximate end of the fibre, using the uniquely- determined measurement of the Fourier coefficients measured through the set of monomode fibre core pairs. This is an implementation of Fourier telescopy. Figure 2 shows an example of a multiple monomode core fibre, in which the cores are distributed in a non-redundant array. By non-redundant, it is meant that no two pairs of cores have equal spacing in both distance and orientation. The fibre of Figure 2 has 161 monomode fibre cores arranged on three concentric circles across a 1 mm diameter fibre bundle with a fibre distal-end pattern. The pattern of fibre cores is modulated with frequencies arranged such that each pair of cores produces a unique frequency modulation. In a scheme modelled, the lowest frequency produced between any fibre-core pair is 200Hz and the highest frequency produced is just under 20MHz. Figure 3 shows spatial and temporal modulation of four fibre cores within the fibre bundle of Figure 2. Here, the four fibre cores are numbered #1 , #2, #3, #4 and each is phase modulated with a frequency, f, hertz (Hz) (frequencies chosen are purely nominal and not high enough to be of real use in endoscopy). Fibre core #1 is unmodulated. Fibre core #2 is modulated at 1 Hz. Fibre core #3 modulated at 3Hz and fibre core #4 modulated at 7Hz. Thus, the core pair (#1 ,#2) has a frequency difference of 1 Hz; the core pair (#1 ,#3) has a frequency difference of 3Hz; the core pair (#1 ,#4) has a frequency difference of 7Hz; the core pair (#2, #3) has a frequency difference of 2Hz; the core pair (#2, #4) has a frequency difference of 6Hz; and the core pair (#3, #4) has a frequency difference of 4Hz. The frequency difference is unique to each core pair, so frequency analysis of the signal allows the assignment of any signal temporal component to a unique core pair. This unique scheme can be extended to more cores within the fibre bundle as required. The white space within the outer circle of Figure 2 represents one possible designation of the area available for cladding-mode collection of the fluorescence from the specimen. If one core is unmodulated the 20MHz bandwidth is adequate for non- redundant encoding of every monomode fibre-core pair with frequencies separated by multiples of 200Hz. With this selection of frequency modulation, data is available to form images at up to 200Hz. Figure 4 shows the spatial frequency map achieved by the fibre-core arrangement for Figures 2 and 3. The 161 -fibre, non-redundant core arrangement provides 12880 unique fibre-core pairs and thus encodes up to twice this number of specimen- fluorescence degrees of freedom. This spatial-frequency coverage is adequate for the synthesis of images using Fourier inversion of the decoded data. If the defined distance to the specimen from the distal end of the fibre is not long compared to the diameter of the monomode fibre core array the collection of the fluorescence signal in the multi-mode fibres or cladding mode can be photometrically efficient. Whilst the embodiment described with reference to Figure 2 is intended for non- redundant use, in some cases, not all core pairs have to be used for imaging. For example, if the array has redundant core pairs only one of the redundant pairs needs to be used for imaging. In this case, redundant cores-pairs could be used for other purposes, such as to allow in use calibration of the system. and to allow for cores obstructed by biofouling, The telescopic image reconstruction works by measuring Fourier coefficients of the specimen fluorescence distribution and reconstructing the specimen image through a numerically-evaluated inverse Fourier transform. Within this general data-analysis scheme, there are various possible ways in which the Fourier coefficients required for the data inversion may be estimated. Several options exist, from using each fibre-core pair in sequence, as described above, to using all fibre cores simultaneously and with a unique temporal modulation assigned to each fibre-core pair. Between these two extremes there are many possibilities. The illumination of the specimen using any pair of monomode cores within the fibre to deliver the radiation may be written: l (x) = (l+cos (2ax+ q>)) p (x) (1 ) where a = , a is the distance between the fibre-core pair considered, / is the A " distance to the specimen from the fibre distal end at which the radiation from the cores overlaps completely, x is the distance measured in the specimen plane, ^ describes the phase difference between the radiation leaving the pair of fibre-cores considered (due, for example, to differential strain in the cores), p(x) describes the illumination spot profile at the specimen produced by the illumination from a single fibre core. It is assumed that all fibre cores are identical in guiding properties and that the cores deliver the same fluorescence-stimulation energy. If this last assumption invalid the cosine term in equation (1 ) should be multiplied by a constant less than unity. In equation (1 ) both and x should be treated as two-dimensional and cue treated as a dot product, but one-dimensional representations are used in the following analysis to simplify the notation. The values of in two dimensions are the spatial frequencies of the specimen fluorescence distribution (related to the (u,v) coordinates used in radio astronomy). If the fluorescence produced in the specimen is proportional to the brightness of the stimulating radiation, the fluorescence from the specimen can be described by: J (x) = (l+cos (2 x+ <p)) p (x) s(x) , (2) where s (x) represents the distribution of fluorophore(s) within the specimen. The product p (x) s (x) represents the specimen fluorescence to be reconstructed using telescopy. To obtain the specimen fluorophore distribution, this will need to be corrected for the modulation by p(x) . In the case of the multi-core fibre endoscope using the cladding to collect the specimen fluorescence, this is equivalent to an integration of equation (2). Thus the specimen signal collected by the fibre cladding can be written d = dl + d2 (3) where and the integrals are to be taken over all space. In equation (3), d2 is a Fourier coefficient of the specimen fluorescence distribution. From the measurement of many different Fourier components the specimen fluorphore distribution can be estimated by numerical inverse Fourier transformation and subsequent division by p(x) . Note that ^ is a number related to the total specimen fluorescence signal. Because the required signal, d2 , is measured with a background term, dx , the noise on the background term must be accounted for in signal to noise (SNR) calculations. dx is also dependent on the specimen fluorescence signal obtained by illuminating the specimen through any one of the fibre cores. Measurement of the variation of this number as the illumination is switched between fibre cores provides a mechanism by means of which the system may be calibrated to effect compensation for bio-fouling of the fibre cores. To obtain a reliable estimate of the specimen fluorescence distribution it is important that measurements are made over a well-distributed set of values in two dimensions. Significant gaps in this distribution may mean that some features of the specimen- fluorescence distribution are not measured. To obtain a good spatial frequency coverage a large number of fibre cores need to be used and, since the spatial frequencies depend on the separation and orientation of the fibre-core pairs, it is usually important that most, if not all, of the fibre cores contribute to the set of measurements to be inverted when estimating the specimen fluorescence distribution. The phase switching to change φ is easily accomplished using modulators of various form and, if more than two fibre-core pairs are used simultaneously to deliver the fluorescence stimulation to the specimen, the measurements associated with each fibre pair can be discriminated by using a frequency modulation of φ . For example, if three fibre cores are used simultaneously, with core 1 unmodulated, core 2 phase modulated at frequency v and core 3 phase modulated at frequency 3v , the measurement on baseline 1 ,2 is encoded at frequency v , measurement on baseline 1 ,3 is modulated at frequency 3 and baseline 2,3 is modulated at 2v , allowing the measurement on each baseline to be measured separately but simultaneously. If <p = 0 , equations (1 ) to (3) show that only cosinusoidal (i.e. even-symmetry) components of the specimen fluorescence distribution are measured. A general distribution has both even and odd components, and both must be measured. Sinusoidal (odd-symmetry) components for each fibre-core pair should therefore be estimated by using two measurements with each fibre-core pair, in which φ is changed by π/2 between the measurements. The phase-modulation scheme can be generalised to measure all available spatial frequencies using all fibre cores for simultaneous frequency- modulated measurement using a non-redundant modulation scheme extended from the non-redundant scheme modulation scheme discussed above. Measurement can also be made using each fibre pair in any sequence, and indeed any appropriate subset of cores can be used if combined with a non-redundant temporal modulation scheme. Figure 5 shows a textual test object used for various image simulations to test the effectiveness of the imaging techniques of the present invention. The test image contains 272 pixels with a set value of unity, and other pixels value 0. The pixels are arranged in a 1 .25x1.25 micron square. The bar, which is 10 microns in length, is not part of the test object. The frame numbering is in pixels. For the purposes of the simulation, the array of fibre-core positions in the distal end of the fibre was generated as a non-redundant array, but the position of the cores within the fibre is not exact and the core-centre positions are 'latched' to the closest point on a 1 .25μιη grid to provide some randomisation. This 'latching' generates a few redundant spacings in the autocorrelation of the core-array. The fibre cores themselves need to be monomode and are modelled as a step-index profile of 4μιη diameter. The fundamental mode within the cores has a Gaussian profile, but in the simulation the beam emerging from each fibre core is modelled as a unit disc of 4μιη diameter. This produces a slightly narrower and sharper envelope for the illumination area on the specimen. The step- index illumination from a single fibre core produces an area of stimulated fluorescence at the test object that is 305μιη in radius to the first null of the radiation pattern. Figure 6 shows a 54-element fibre-core array. This was used in the simulations. The array is designed to place all cores on a circle of 122μιη radius at the fibre distal end. The spot in the centre merely marks the centre and does not represent a core-position for the array. The array is designed as two sets of 27 cores spaced uniformly around the circle. In each array this gives a minimum separation between cores of 28.33μιη. There is an angular shift between the arrays chosen such that the cores from one array are spaced approximately 1/3 of the way between the cores in the other array. This means that the shortest spacings produced in the complete array are approximately 1/3, 2/3, 1 , 4/3 etc of the 28.33μιη spacing in the first array. This gives a shortest inter- core spacing of ~8.8μιη. The next closest fibre-core spacing is approximately 18μιη and the modal leakage over this distance is not severe. Modal leakage between the closest core pairs is controlled by fabrication of these core pairs in an initial fibre preform, which is then stacked with 27 of these preforms around a ring to make a second preform from which the multicore fibre is drawn. This method of fabrication allows a variety of approaches to be taken to minimise modal leakage between the shortest core separations. The method is easily generalised to produce a wide variety of final fibre-core arrays. Figure 7 shows the autocorrelation of the fibre-core array of Figure 6. Note the close and relatively-uniform spacing between the inner rings. Note also that the points in the inner rings are so close together that they form continuous rings. Because of the 'latching' of the fibre cores to a grid some of these spacings actually overlap, showing that there is some redundancy in array spacings. Indeed, since the fibre cores have a physical diameter that is several times the grid lattice, the autocorrelations of the fibre core overlap and this allows the use of a simple sharpness approach to calibration of the array. The closeness of the sample points in the inner rings of the autocorrelation provides a high weighting to measurements of the low spatial frequencies, which is generally regarded as desirable when imaging extended structures. There are gaps apparent in the autocorrelation at larger radii, although these gaps are not large and are well distributed. In all the simulations of telescopic imaging, the object shown in Figure 5 is embedded within a full image field of 625μιη square, each pixel being 1 .25χ1 .25μιτι square. The fibre-core array has a diameter of 244μιη and the test object is located at a range of 2mm from the fibre distal end. The fluorescence wavelength is modelled at 500nm giving a Nyquist sampling interval for the image to be reconstructed of 1 .25μιη matching the sampling pixellation used. Data is collected as a series of measurements delivering the stimulating radiation through all 1431 fibre-core pairs in sequence, with two measurements made for each core pair and a π/2 phase shift between measurements with the same fibre-core pair in order to measure both odd- and even- symmetry components in the source structure. In all forward simulations of data generation the Fourier transforms of the test object and the illumination produced from the fibre core pairs are evaluated using a long-hand DFT and numerical integration. The image reconstructions presented here represent just the central 128x128 pixels (the central 160χ160μιη) unless otherwise stated. Figure 8(a) shows a central image region showing the points spread function (psf) for the synthesis-imaging array of Figure 6. The side lobes lead to a significant reduction in image contrast and will reduce sensitivity. The central image spike is superresolved compared to the image that would have been obtained through a conventional lens with the same diameter as the fibre-core array. Figure 8(b) shows a cut through the psf centre across the full 512x512pixel (625χ625μιη) image. Note the extended side lobes which are shown unmodulated by the effect of the fibre-core diameters. Many image processing techniques have been developed for the removal of these sidelobe structures in radio astronomy (e.g. CLEAN). The initial stage of the simulation models intensity measurements made in the absence of any noise. These measurements are simulated by using a long-hand Fourier transformation to produce sine and cosine fringes that would be formed through each fibre-core pair at the appropriate scale for imaging a specimen structure at a distance of 2mm from the fibre distal end. It is assumed that the illumination discs from each of the cores are overlapped perfectly at this range through the use of microprisms fabricated on the fibre distal end. The sine and cosine intensity pattern produced at the specimen plane is then multiplied by the source fluorescence distribution. The product of the sinusoid pattern with the source fluorescence distribution, and the cosinusoid pattern with the source fluorescence distribution are then integrated, giving two numbers that represent the integrated fluorescence signal that can be collected from the specimen. In the fibre endoscope these total fluorescence signals will be collected in the fibre cladding. The efficiency of collection will depend on both the area of the fibre distal end and the angle that that distal end subtends to the specimen. For a 2mm range to the specimen and a fibre distal end of 0.5mm diameter the effective collection efficiency will be that associated with an f/4 optical lens system. These two numbers are stored for later use to calculate the noise expected on the data as a function of the source brightness. In order easily to reference the intensity measurements to the fibre-core pair used the data form an M fibre-core system is stored in an M xM data matrix. The cosine (even symmetry) components are stored above the diagonal and the sine (odd-symmetry) components are stored below the diagonal. In clinical applications despite the use of anti-fouling measures there is a risk of bio-fouling, so the diagonal components in this matrix are used to store the total fluorescence intensity obtained from the specimen when the fluorescence stimulation radiation is provided from a single fibre core. The diagonal components then provide the data required both to identify any fibre cores obstructed by fouling and to correct for reduced fringe contrast obtained if individual cores are partially blocked. The data stored in the matrix may be contaminated by noise of any required level to represent different source fluorescence strengths. Each off-diagonal component contains a signal term and a background term, as shown in equation (3). This background term needs to be evaluated from the appropriate diagonal matrix components for the two fibre cores involved in measuring the given source Fourier component. For each diagonal component the estimated number of photon detections is determined by a random number generated from the Poisson distribution appropriate to a given brightness of simulation radiation. The appropriate off-diagonal elements for the fibre-core pair considered are now similarly contaminated by Poisson noise, after which the estimates of the odd and even Fourier components are obtained by subtracting the noise-contaminated background from the noise contaminated off-diagonal components. These noise-contaminated data are then used as data elements in a sparse-matrix inverse Fourier transform to obtain the raw-image obtained from the noise-contaminated data. An image obtained by synthesis-imaging of the complete simulation image field is shown in Figure 9, with the textual target in the centre. Since the target is small and hard to assess in this picture the subsequent images show only the central portion. The extended fringe structures towards to outer edges of this image are image artefacts due to the synthesis-imaging array. The presence of such fringes is a powerful constraint in reconstructing the diffraction-limited source image from this raw- image data. The bar represents 10μιη and the pixels of this 512x512 image are 1 .25x1 .25 μιη in size. Other images shown represent just the central 128x128 pixel region of this field. Figures 10(a) to (d) show the degradation of the raw synthesised image as the fluorescence signal degrades, in particular for total photon counts of 108, 107, 106 and 105. These images are representative in the sense that only a single reconstruction has been done for each signal level and no selection is involved in the images presented. The images represent what can be achieved in real-time imaging without image processing of the raw telescopic images. The data inversion is fast and there is scope for processing of the raw signal and maintaining real-time presentation in a clinical environment. The image recorded with a total photon image count of 106 is still usable and the test text easy to read. The text used consists of 272 signal pixels and the complete set of measurements required for synthesis imaging equates to about 3,700 photons per fluorescent pixel. The image recorded with a total photon image count of 105 is not of a useful quality. The text in this last image can just be discerned and signal processing using more sophisticated imaging strategies or image averaging may still be viable. Through manipulation of the spatial and temporal properties of certain fibres, pairs of fibres or larger groups of fibres within the fibre bundle, it is possible to image on multiple imaging planes thereby providing additional data on the specimen. There may be any number of imaging planes of interest to the observer but for the purposes of illustration a first group of fibres could be chosen to image the -1 image plane; a second group could be chosen to image the 0 image plane and a third to image the +1 image plane etc. The numbering here refers to whether the radiation from the fibre core overlaps at a range closer to or further from the fibre distal end. To improve the overall optical performance of the imaging system, in some embodiments it may be useful to insert one or more optical elements (such as a lens, series of lenses or a diffractive optical element) between one or more parts of the system. For example, if a GRIN lens of suitable (0.25) pitch is used at the distal end of the fibre (as shown in Figure 1 1 ), the defined distance to the specimen can be such that the specimen can touch one end of the GRIN lens and the fibre bundle can touch the other end of the GRIN. Equally, using a GRIN lens of a different pitch provides an ability to select a larger defined distance. If no GRIN lens is to be used at the fibre distal end the defined distance can be chosen by using small prisms or any other beam-direction elements mounted on the end of each monomode fibre core. The present invention has numerous advantages. The use of Fourier telescopy permits N (N-1 ) specimen components to be encoded from the simultaneous interferometric use of N monomode fibre cores arranged in a non-redundant array. The use of cladding modes or multi-mode fibre cores with the endscope fibre bundle permits the achievement of high collection efficiency of the specimen fluorescence by the fibre distal end. The use of phase/frequency encoded Fourier telescopy permits the use of multi-mode fibres and/or cladding modes to integrate the fluorescence signal and to combine this on a single detector element or pixel. The monomode illumination cores can be calibrated using reflections from the fibre distal end (e.g. Fresnel reflections) to produce an image whose structure is defined by the Fourier transform of the core-array pattern, or can be calibrated from the interference between distal and proximate ends of the fibre cores. The use of monomode coherent fibre cores to produce the interference pattern to stimulate specimen fluorescence and a non-redundant encoding scheme to provide a unique modulation for the interference from each monomode fibre core pair simplifies data analysis compared to schemes based on the use of multimode fibre structures for illumination of the specimen. Any array of monomode fibres (whether redundantly or non-redundantly arranged) can be used to illuminate the specimen. The number of degrees of freedom of specimen information to be estimated can be achieved through use of several arrays for specimen illumination and such arrays can form total independent or partially redundant arrays. The modulation scheme can be implemented by any arrangement of phase and/or amplitude modulation that can be represented through a full rank matrix equation that links the integrated measurements made through the multi-mode fluorescence collection system to the specimen degrees of freedom to be reconstructed. A skilled person will appreciate that variations of the disclosed arrangements are possible without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, whilst the invention is described with preference to fluorescence, other types of radiation could be detected, such as radiation reflected or scattered from the sample at the same or even at a different wavelength from the radiation that is incident on the specimen. Accordingly, the above description of the specific embodiment is made by way of example only and not for the purposes of limitation. It will be clear to the skilled person that minor modifications may be made without significant changes to the operation described. 1 .

An imaging apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein the optical fibre includes at least one multi-mode core and radiation from the target is transmitted to the detector via said at least one multi-mode core. 5. An imaging apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein the monomode cores are surrounded by cladding and radiation from the target is transmitted to the detector via said cladding. 6. An imaging apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims wherein the modulator is operable to implement a modulation scheme arranged to ensure that separate monomode fibre cores produce sine and cosine illumination patterns required for delivering a specimen image by Fourier analysis. 7. An apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims wherein one or more optical components are arranged at the fibre distal end to cause radiation from the monomode cores to overlap at a defined distance from the sources. 8. An apparatus as claimed in claim 7 wherein the one or more optical elements comprise a lens, for example a GRIN lens. 9. An apparatus as claimed in claim 7 or claim 8 in which the interference pattern is produced at the specimen through the use of a diffractive optical element or a lens array. 10. An apparatus as claimed in any of claims 7 to 9, wherein the one or more optical components comprise one or more beam-steering devices. 1 1 . An apparatus as claimed in claim 9, wherein the target is positioned approximately on the surface of the diffractive element or lens array. 12. An apparatus according to claim 1 where imaging occurs on multiple image planes, for example the -1 , 0 or +1 image planes through selective signal processing of fibre cores in the fibre bundle. 13. An apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims wherein the radiation from the target is fluorescence. 14. An apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 12 wherein the radiation from the target is scattered radiation. 15. An imaging apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein the modulation is such that signals from each pair of cores and between two or more measurements from each pair of cores are distinguishable by the analyser. 16. An imaging system as claimed in any preceding claim in which the detectior collects radiation from the target travelling in directions other than a solid angle containing the array of spatially-distinct sources. 17. An imaging system as claimed in any of the preceding claims wherein the detector has two or more detecting elements that collect radiation from the target over different angular ranges.
