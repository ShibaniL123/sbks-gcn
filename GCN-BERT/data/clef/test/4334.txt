The functionalized, substituted naphthalene fluorophore compounds display novel fluorescent properties. BACKGROUND Designing and building small molecules for the purpose of function enables advancement in fields ranging from pharmaceuticals to pesticides. The Diels-Alder (DA) reaction is one of the most powerful and robust transformations for assembling cyclic molecular frameworks, employing a plethora of diene (4π) and dienophile (2π) components capable of delivering a rich diversity of cyclic compounds poised for function. One structural variant is the dehydro-Diels-Alder (DDA) reaction, where one, two, or all three of the double bonds of the classic diene and dienophile are replaced with triple bonds, providing access to substituted aromatic compounds not accessible using other chemistries. The energy price to incorporate the high degree of precursor unsaturation required for the formation of aromatic products can be mitigated by the propensity of cyclohexadiene derivatives to aromatize. Aromatic derivatives, in turn, can be prepared from more saturated precursors, a process defined as a dehydrogenative DA reaction. A particularly problematic, but potentially useful dehydrogenative DA reaction involves the use of styrene as the diene component and an alkyne dienophile, affording a cycloadduct that can aromatize under oxidative conditions to give naphthalene derivatives (Scheme 1). Problems that can arise when using styrene as the diene range from polymerizations to [2+2] cycloaddition reactions. One solution is to use very reactive dienophiles such as maleic anhydride or benzoquinone. However, the desired cycloadducts are typically obtained in low yields because the reactivity of these dienophiles leads to a second DA reaction with the newly formed diene of the first cycloadduct. Lack of regioselectivity for the styrenyl DA reaction is also a drawback, which can be overcome by carrying out the reaction intramolecularly. The intramolecular styrenyl DA reaction also suffers from low yields and long reaction times, producing mixtures of inseparable dihydronaphthalene and naphthalene products. Continued interest in the development of an efficient styrenyl DA reaction is driven by the need for functionalized naphthalene compounds that can serve as valuable building blocks for the synthesis of small molecules in many important areas, such as pharmaceuticals, chiral reagents, liquid crystals, and organic dyes. Moreover, the intramolecular styrenyl DA reaction affords a unique functionalization pattern on the resulting naphthalene derivatives that complements other synthetic approaches. Fluorescent-based tools are widely used to monitor environments of biological events. Small organic fluorophores are particularly powerful due to rapid response times for monitoring real-time events with excellent spatial resolution. Moreover, their relatively small size minimizes disruption of the environment being studied. Thus, new small molecule-based chemical sensors are continually being developed. Many of these developments involve modifying an existing fluorophore to accommodate a need. For example, Prodan is a compound whose fluorescent emission and quantum yield is unusually dependent upon solvent polarity; in cyclohexane the fluorescent emission is 410 nm and in water it is 534 nm, a bathochromic shift of 124 nm. Prodan is considered to be state of the art for application in biological systems and structural variants of this probe have been prepared, such as the lipophilic Laurdan; the thiol reactive Acrylodan and Badan; and the amino acid-containing Aladan. In addition, a spectrally red-shifted compound, Anthradan, has been prepared that incorporates an anthracene ring between the electron donating and electron withdrawing groups; the emission spectra in hexanes is 483 nm, and in methanol 604 nm. The design and synthesis of new naphthalene-containing fluorophores could be significantly enhanced by novel methods for the construction of aromatic rings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure describes substituted, functionalized naphthalenes which display useful properties and uses as fluorophores, solvatochromatic fluorophores, components of photo voltaic devices, structural components in conjugated polymers, pharmaceuticals, light harvesting components, and liquid crystals. The present disclosure utilizes an intramolecular didehydro-Diels-Alder (DDA) reaction between a styrene and an alkyne linked by a tether for the synthesis of new substituted naphthalene compounds that can be used as fluorescent tags. It was envisioned that a number of modifications can be made, either linearly or combinatorially, to the DDA precursors and/or to the DDA products, leading to novel substituted naphthalene compounds that will be tested for their general chemical and fluorescent properties such as: molecular absorbance, quantum yield, excitation wavelength, emission wavelength, Stokes shift, fluorescent lifetime, photostability, and solubility, that are essential for sensing applications. Examples of modifications to the precursor include but are not limited to, substitution at the terminus of the alkyne (R1), the aromatic ring (R2), the double bond (R3) and/or the tether (XYZ). Examples of modifications that can be made to the product include but are not limited to any or all of the following: conversion of R1 to R4, R2 to R5, R3 to R6, and/or XYZ to ABC. As generally used herein, the terms “include” and “have” mean “comprising”. As generally used herein, the term “about” refers to an acceptable degree of error for the quantity measured, given the nature or precision of the measurements. Typical exemplary degrees of error may be within 20%, 10%, or 5% of a given value or range of values. Alternatively, and particularly in biological systems, the term “about” may mean values that are within an order of magnitude, potentially within 5-fold or 2-fold of a given value. Recently, in our studies directed towards expanding the scope of the thermal [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of allene-ynes, naphthalene 2 was obtained and none of the anticipated [2+2] cycloaddition product between the allene and the alkyne of 1 upon microwave irradiation in ortho-dichlorobenzene at 225° C. for 5 min. While the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of 2 contained well-defined resonances in the aromatic region diagnostic of a cyclopentanaphthalene, verification of the product structure having a linear or angular arrangement was elusive. The cyclopentanaphthalene derivative possessing a linear arrangement of the three rings could originate from the uncommon IMDA discussed above. The angular cyclopentanaphthalene could arise from a thermal [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between the double bond of the styrenyl group and the alkynone, followed by a 4π-electrocyclic ring opening of the corresponding cyclobutene to yield a new diene. Isomerization of the appended double bond from the Z- to the E-isomer, followed by a 6π-electrocyclic ring closing and aromatization would yield the angular product. The linear structure of compound 2 was confirmed by an X-ray crystal structure of o-nitrophenyl sulfonyl hydrazone 3. The outstanding selectivity of this IMDA reaction for the naphthalene product over the dihydronaphthalene product (1:0), the high yield, and an overall interest in naphthalene derivatives compelled us to study this reaction further. Or investigations differ from existing methods for the synthesis of naphthalene derivatives via the IMDA reaction of styrenes, all of them sharing a few common features such as 1) the enyne precursors contain either a heteroatom and/or a carbonyl group(s) within the tether (mainly amides and esters); 2) limited functionality on the terminus of the alkyne, usually trimethylsilyl (TMS) or phenyl groups, or a hydrogen atom; 3) reaction conditions requiring high temperatures and long reaction times; and 4) most naphthalene products are contaminated with varying quantities of dihydronaphthalene byproducts. Moreover, our initial result directly opposes the work reported by Matsubara, who suggests that a TMS group on the terminus of the alkyne is necessary for the exclusive formation of the naphthalene over the dihydronaphthalene product. A concise synthesis of a dehydrogenative IMDA styrenyl precursor 5 was accomplished in 3 steps, and in a manner entirely analogous to that used for the preparation of 1. Aldehyde 4 is prepared by a PCC oxidation of commercially available 5-hexyn-1-ol in 81% yield. Next, reaction of the lithium or sodium salt of diethyl benzylphosphonate with aldehyde 4 affords the styrene moiety of 5 in 68% yield. Deprotonation of the alkyne terminus with n-BuLi followed by acetylation of the acetylide produces 5 in 69% yield. For the ensuing IMDA reaction, solvents with lower boiling points were considered because of difficulties in removing high boiling o-dichlorobenzene. Microwave irradiation of styrene 5 in either 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) at 180° C. for 30 min or 1,1,1-trifluorotoluene at 180° C. for 180 minutes afforded the cyclopenta-naphthalene derivative 6 in nearly quantitative yield with no additional purification required of the final product (entries 1 and 2, Table 1). With conditions for an efficient and high yielding IMDA reaction utilizing a lower boiling solvent in hand, scope and limitations investigations were initiated. First, substitution on the aryl group was examined; exchanging a hydrogen atom for a chlorine atom was deemed valuable, enabling access to a wide-range of naphthalene derivatives via palladium-catalyzed cross coupling reactions. Moreover, a chlorine atom is more stable and accessible than other halides or groups used for coupling, such as triflates. Styrenyl derivatives 5b, 5c, and 5d were prepared and subjected to microwave irradiation. The para-chlorostyrene 5b gave 7-chloronaphthalene 6b in quantitative yield after 200 min (entry 3). The ortho-chlorostyrene 5c also produced only one product, the 5-chloronaphthalene 6c in 86% yield, even though two products are possible (entry 4). The meta-chlorostyrene 5d gave an inseparable 1.4:1 mixture of the 6-chloro- and 8-chloronaphthalenes, 6d and 6d′ in 79% yield (entry 5). Next, a number of functional groups on the terminus of the alkyne were investigated in the IMDA reaction. Substitution of the alkyne with a phenyl methanone gave the cycloadduct 6e in quantitative yield after 90 min (entry 6). Reaction scale did not affect the yield of this reaction, but it did have an affect on the reaction time; for example, 50 mg of 5e afforded 6e in 90 min, while 200 mg of 5e required a reaction time of 130 min. Placement of the methylsulfonyl and phenylsulfonyl groups on the terminus of the alkyne to produce 5f and 5g resulted in a facile IMDA reaction to give 6f and 6g in 78% and 89% yield, respectively (entries 7 and 8). Sulfoxide 5h gave a slightly lower yield, but still afforded the naphthalene product 6h selectively (entry 9). Similarly, the diethyl phosphonate substituted alkyne 5i produced 6i in greater than 95% yield in 150 min (entry 10). Alkynal 5j affords the naphthalene 6j in 83% yield in 45 min (entry 11). A substrate with a methyl ester on the alkyne terminus 5k, slowed the reaction considerably, requiring 600 min to obtain complete conversion to 6k in 76% yield (entry 12). The reaction time could be shortened from 600 to TABLE 1 Microwave-Assisted Dehydrogenative Diels-Alder Reaction entry 5 R1 R2 X time 6 yield (%) 7 yield (%) 1 5a C(O)CH3 H —CH2— 30 >95 (6a) 0 (7a) 2a 5a C(O)CH3 H —CH2— 180 >95 (6a) 0 (7a) 3 5b C(O)CH3 p-Cl —CH2— 200 >95 (6b, 7-chloro) 0 (7b) 4b 5c C(O)CH3 o-Cl —CH2— 180 86 (6c, 5-chloro) 0 (7c) 5b 5d C(O)CH3 m-Cl —CH2— 180 79 (6d, 6d′ 6-, 8- 0 (7d) 6 5e C(O)Ph H —CH2— 90 >95 (6e) 0 (7e) 7c 5f SO2CH3 H —CH2— 20 76 (6f) 0 (7f) 8 5g SO2Ph p-Cl —CH2— 15 89 (6g, 7-chloro) 0 (7g) 9 5h SOPh p-Cl —CH2— 60 75 (6h, 7-chloro) 0 (7h) 10c 5i P(O)OEt2 p-Cl —CH2— 150 >95 (6i, 7-chloro) 0 (7i) 11 5j CHO p-Cl —CH2— 45 83 (6j, 7-chloro) 0 (7j) 12 5k CO2CH3 H —CH2— 600 76 (6k) 0 (7k) 13d 5k CO2CH3 H —CH2— 90 >95 (6k) 0 (7k) 14a,b 5l C(O)CH3 H —(CH2)2— 50 >95 (6l) 0 (7l) 15c 5m C(O)CH3 o-Cl —C(CO2Et)2— 30 >95 (6m, 5-chloro) 0 (7m) 16 5n C(O)CH3 H —O— 30 28 (6n) 15 (7n) 17 5o C(O)CH3 H —NTs— 10 30 (6o) 56 (7o) 18b 5p C(O)CH3 o-Cl —NTs— 10 24 (6p, 5-chloro) 48 (7p) 19b 5p C(O)CH3 o-Cl —NTs— 10 59 (6p, 5-chloro) 6 (7p) aReaction performed using 1,1,1-trifluorotoluene as solvent; bReaction performed using o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) as solvent; cReaction performed in DCB at 225° C.; dReaction performed at 300° C. in DCB. 90 min by heating to 225° C. in o-dichlorobenzene; this also resulted in an improved yield of 97% (entry 13). The rate of these IMDA reactions (entries 1-13) corresponds well with Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory and HOMO-LUMO gaps. Finally, structural changes in the tether were examined. Extending the tether by one methylene unit gave precursor 5l that required heating at 300° C. for 50 min in o-dichlorobenzene but provided the product 6l in quantitative yield (heating at 225° C. for 240 minutes resulted in recovery of starting material). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful styrenyl IMDA reaction using a four-atom tether to provide naphthalene containing an additional six-membered ring. Reaction of the precursor 5m with an all carbon tether possessing a diester moiety afforded only 6m in greater than 95% yield in 30 min (entry 15). Next, an ether tether was used to connect the styrene and the alkyne. The cycloaddition of 5n was complete in 30 min and gave a 2:1 ratio of the naphthalene 6n to the dihydronaphthalene 7m (entry 16). The toluenesulfonamide substrate 5o also afforded a mixture of products, but in a 2:1 ratio of the dihydronaphthalene 7o to naphthalene 6o in 10 min in a combined yield of 86% (entry 17). The case of the toluenesulfonamide tether with a chloro group on the aromatic ring also provided a 2:1 ratio of the dihydronaphthalene 7p to naphthalene 6p in 10 min in a combined yield of 72% (entry 18). If 5p was heated to 225° C. for 10 min, nearly a 10:1 ratio of naphthalene 7p to dihydronaphthalene 6p was obtained in 65% yield (entry 19). For each of the heteroatom-containing tethers a mixture of products was observed; furthermore, when the reaction time was extended to 120 min for entry 5p, the ratio of naphthalene 6p to internal standard did not change, but the dihydronaphthalene 7p was no longer evident by 1H NMR, suggesting that dihydronaphthalene 7p is not converted to 6p. Separation of dihydronaphthalene 7p and naphthalene 6p could not be accomplished by column chromatrography, so attempts were made to oxidize the mixture to 6p using cerric ammonium nitrate (CAN), dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ), Pd/C, or O2. All reactions gave either complete decomposition of the naphthalene and dihydronaphthalene products, or selective decomposition of the dihydronaphthalene. These naphthalene derivatives may be used as potential candidates for application to the ever-increasing field of small molecule fluorescent probes. Consequently, reaction of 6b to a palladium-catalyzed amination reaction using RuPhos precatalyst, LHMDS and N,N-dimethylamine afforded cyclopentanaphthalene 8 in 70% yield. Compound 8 was strongly fluorescent with an absorption maxima of 377 nm and an emission maxima of 510 nm. The emission maximum was significantly red-shifted from the structurally similar Prodan, which has an emission maxima of 440 nm in dichloroethane. Moreover, a quantum yield of 99% was measured for compound 8 in dichloroethane. A thermal dehydrogenative Diels-Alder reaction affords cyclopenta-naphthalenes in excellent yield. For all cases examined, the styrene functioned only as a diene contrary to literature reports of competing reactivity. For the heteroatom-containing tether, dihydro-naphthalenes were obtained along with the naphthalene products. Investigations are underway to understand the mechanism by which these two products are formed. Finally, it has been demonstrated the synthetic utility of this method by preparing fluorophore 8 with interesting photophysical properties. Prodan 8a is a compound whose fluorescent emission and quantum yield is unusually dependent upon solvent polarity; in cyclohexane the fluorescent emission is 410 nm and in water it is 534 nm, a bathochromic shift of 124 nm. Prodan is considered to be state of the art for application in biological systems and structural variants of this probe have been prepared, such as the lipophilic Laurdan 8b; the thiol reactive Acrylodan 8c and Badan 8d; and the amino acid-containing Aladan 8e. In addition, a spectrally red-shifted compound, Anthradan 8f, has been prepared that incorporates an anthracene ring between the electron donating and electron withdrawing groups; the emission spectra in hexanes is 483 nm, and in methanol 604 nm. Prodan Derviatives For each of these Prodan derivatives, the donor-acceptor substituents are located along the x-axis (longer axis) of the naphthalene pi-system, and the amino group can be characterized as exonuclear and sterically unhindered. For the anthracene analog, even though the emission wavelength was significantly red-shifted, the quantum efficiency was lower. The design and synthesis of new naphthalene-containing fluorophores could be significantly enhanced by novel methods for the construction of aromatic rings. As described herein, the synthesis and fluorescent properties of a series of novel Prodan derivatives, enabled by the microwave-assisted dehydrogenative Diels-Alder reaction, whereby the acceptor and/or donor substituents are located along the y-axis (shorter axis) of the conjugated system, providing a more rigid conjugated structure between the acceptor and donor groups. With an eye towards the preparation of a series of aminonaphthalene derivatives, cross coupling reactions were examined for the introduction of electron donating amine groups via the chloronaphthalene. For this process, the versatile palladium-catalyzed amination of aryl halides has emerged as a valuable tool. For the first generation derivative, dimethylamine and chloronaphthalenes 6b, 6c, 6d and 6d′ were selected so that photophysical properties of this first generation of derivatives could be directly compared to that of Prodan (Scheme 4). The coupling reaction of 6b and 6d using a commercially available RuPhos precatalyst (2.5 mol %) and LHMDS in dry THF afforded the corresponding N,N-dimethylamine substituted cyclopentanaphthalenes 10 and 12 in 70% and 49% yield, respectively. Different palladium sources (Pd(OAc)2) and bases (K3PO4, CsCO3) were also screened, but all resulted in lower yields of the coupling products. Interestingly, the inseparable mixture of 6d and 6d′ gave two products: 11 in 52% yield along with 6a. It is hypothesized that 6a arises from a palladium catalyzed-dehalogenation reaction of 6d′ facilitated by the close proximity of the methyl ketone. Next, a number of amines were coupled with 6b. Secondary cyclic amines such as pyrrole, piperidine, and morpholine gave the corresponding tertiary amines 13, 14, and 15 in 59%, 45% and 58% yield, respectively. Primary amines such as benzylamine, aniline, and para-methoxyaniline were also successfully coupled with 6b to afford 16, 17 and 18 in 89%, 78% and 71% yield, respectively. With a series of compounds with the donor and acceptor groups separated by a naphthalene nucleus in hand, fluorescent absorption and emission maximum were measured in methylene chloride, along with quantum yields. Notable trend's for this series of solvatochromic compounds were observed. Compound 12 containing a 1,5-substituted cyclopentanaphthalene moiety absorbed light at a much shorter wavelength (332 nm) and fluoresced at a much longer wavelength (562 nm) than either the 1,7- or 1,6-disubstituted compounds 10 or 11 (absorption and emission maximum ˜375 nm and 510 nm). The tertiary cyclic amine series showed a range of absorption maxima (355-390 nm) while the emission maxima remained constant (508-515 nm). The emission spectra of the secondary amines 16, 17, and 18 were significantly blue-shifted (482-492 nm) when compared to the tertiary amines, but there were not significant differences in absorption or emission maxima between each of the secondary amines. Finally, the quantum yields for all fluorophores in Scheme 4 were extremely high, with one exception, compound 12. Finally, solvatochromic properties for compounds 10, 11, and 12 were measured in a number of solvents varying in polarity (FIG. 2). Several important findings emerged from these measurements, the first being that in the case of all fluorophores, as the solvent polarity increases the emission maxima are significantly red-shifted. For example, the emission maxima for compounds 10, 11, and 12 are 466, 445 and 480 nm in cyclohexane and 578, 605, and 634 nm in ethanol, respectively. Moreover, the emission spectra are significantly red-shifted from that of Prodan, which emits at 389 nm in hexanes and 485 nm in ethanol. Red-shifted fluorescent emissions are important for biological applications where background fluorescence can limit the magnitude of the fluorescent change.

According to specific embodiments, the substituted, functionalized naphthalenes synthesized by the methods of the present disclosure may have a molecular structure according to Formula I. According to Formula I, R1 may be a substituent selected from the group consisting of H, C1-C20 alkyl, C1-C20 alkoxy, phenyl, aryl, heteroaryl, —S(O)R4, —S(O)2R4, P(O)(OR4)2, and —C(Y)R4 where Y is O, NR5, or S; each R2 may be a halogen or an electron donating group selected from —N(R6)2, —OR6, and —SR6; each R3 may be H, C1-C20 alkyl, or combined as ═O; each R4, R5 and R6 may be independently selected from H, C1-C20 alkyl, C1-C20 alkoxy, phenyl, aryl, heteroaryl or may come together to form a cyclic structure; X is CH2, C(R6)2, C(CO2Alkyl)2, O, NTs, NH, NCOR5 or NR5; n is an integer from 0 to 2; m is an integer from 1 to 4. According to certain embodiments, suitable fluorescence may be observed when one of R1 or R3 has a pi bond that is in conjugation with the pi system of the naphthalene ring. Therefore, according to the naphthalenes of the present disclosure, at least one of R1 and R3 will comprise a pi bond in conjugation with the pi system of the naphthalene ring, i.e., provided that either R1 is one of —S(O)R4, —S(O)2R4, P(O)(OR4)2, and —C(Y)R4 and/or R3 is ═O. The R2 group in the various embodiments may further be selected from C1, C1-C20 alkyl groups or phenyl, aryl, or heteroaryl groups when more than one R2 group is present provided that at least one R2 group is an electron donating group. Other electron donating groups that may be suited as R2 such as groups with an atom having a lone pair of electrons that is attached either directly to the carbon of the naphthalene ring or attached indirectly to a carbon of the naphthalene ring by a pi system that is in conjugation with the pi system of the naphthalene. Examples include heteroaromatic groups, phenyl or aromatic groups with a conjugated electron donating group. The structure according to Formula I, may further comprise substitution on the carbons of the naphthalene ring, or on the carbons of the non-aromatic ring, such as the cyclopentyl ring (where n=1). For example, according to certain embodiments, the naphthalene ring may be substituted on two adjacent carbons with at least one carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring fused to the naphthalene ring. In specific embodiments, the fused ring may be at least one aromatic ring or a heteroaromatic ring. For example, according to certain embodiments the naphthalene ring may have a phenyl ring(s) fused to the naphthalene ring, thereby making an anthracenyl-type ring system, a phenanthracenyl-type ring system. The ring(s) fused to the naphthalene rings may be substituted with various substituents, such as the ones described herein, and including electron withdrawing or electron donating groups (such as R2-type groups). Without intending to be limited by any interpretation, it is believed that changing the substitution and/extending the pi system of the naphthalene system may be used to tune the optical properties of the compound, such as the fluorescent properties. In specific embodiments, R1 may be —S(O)R4, —S(O)2R4, P(O)(OR4)2, or —C(Y)R4, Y may be O or NR5 and R4 and R5 may independently be H, C1-C20 alkyl, C1-C20 alkoxy, phenyl, or aryl, and each R2 is Cl, —N(R6)2, or —OR6, where each R6 may be H, C1-C20 alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, or come together to form a cyclyl or heterocyclyl structure having 4-5 carbon atoms. According to particular embodiments, R1 may —C(Y)R4, Y is O, and R4 may be H, C1-C20 alkyl, C1-C20 alkoxy, phenyl, or aryl. In still other embodiments of the functionalized naphthalenes described herein, wherein R2 may be Cl, such as in the product of the dehydrogenative dihydro Diels Alder reaction, or alternatively, in the resulting fluorescent compound. In other embodiments, at least one R2 may be an electron donating group, such as, —N(R6)2, or —OR6, where each R6 may be H, C1-C20 alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, or come together to form a cyclyl or heterocyclyl structure having 4-5 carbon atoms. According to these embodiments, specific fluorescent properties, such as solvatochromic properties, may be observed with these substituted functionalized naphthalenes. According to other embodiments, the R3 groups may together form a carbonyl group (C═O). According to these embodiments, the R1 group need not be in conjugation with the naphthalene ring in order to observe fluorescence. In specific embodiments, where the R3 groups are combined as a carbonyl (C═O), the X group may be CH2 (i.e., a cyclic ketone), C(R6)2 (i.e., a cyclic ketone), O (a lactone), or NTs (an amide), R1 may be any of the groups described herein and in specific embodiments may be H, C1-C20 alkyl, C1-C20 alkoxy, phenyl, aryl, or heteroaryl, and each R2 may be Cl, or an electron donating group such as —N(R6)2, or —OR6, where each R6 is H, C1-C20 alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, or come together to form a cyclyl or heterocyclyl structure having 4-5 carbon atoms. As used herein the term “cyclyl” means a cyclic group where the two R6 groups on the nitrogen come together to from a four, five, six or seven membered ring including 3-6 substituted or unsubstituted carbon atoms and the nitrogen of the electron donating group. As used herein the term “heterocyclyl” means a heterocyclic group where the two R6 groups on the nitrogen come together to from a four, five, six or seven membered ring including 2-5 substituted or unsubstituted carbon atoms, at least one second heteroatom such as an O, N, P, or S, and the nitrogen of the electron donating group. According to specific embodiments, the substituted functionalized naphthalenes of the present disclosure may have a structure: As described in detail herein, the substituted functionalized naphthalenes of the present disclosure, such as the naphthalenes according to Formula I, may be a fluorophore. That is, the substituted functionalized naphthalenes may absorb electromagnetic radiation at a short wavelength, such as a wavelength in the visible or UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum and emit or fluoresce light having a longer wavelength than the absorption wavelength. In particular embodiments, the fluorescent naphthalenes described herein may display a fluorescent emission maximum at a wavelength of from 450 nm to 650 nm. Emissions in these wavelengths may be of particular interest since many conventional fluorophores do not emit near the red end of the spectrum. The red shift observed for the present fluorophores make them potentially useful in a number of applications such as an imaging fluorescent agent, a tagging fluorescent agent, an ultimately use in medical diagnostics. In specific embodiments, the various substituted functionalized naphthalenes of the present disclosure may be solvatochromic fluorophores. Solvatochromic fluorophores display different fluorescent properties, such as emission maxima, absorption maxima, quantum yields, depending on the solvents that they are dissolved or suspended in. Solvatochromism may allow the fluorescent species, such as a tagged compound, metabolite, cellular component, environmental contaminant etc., to be traced as it migrates from one solvated environment to another, for example by monitoring the fluorescent emission maximum of the fluorescent species. Conventional solvatochromic fluorophores, such as Prodan, may be limited because of their short wavelength emission maximum which can overlap with emission wavelength of other system components. In contrast, the solvatochromic fluorescent naphthalenes of the present disclosure may display a fluorescent emission maximum as wavelengths at least 50 nm longer than the fluorescent emission maximum of Prodan in the same solvent, and in certain embodiments up to 200 nm longer than the emission maximum of Prodan in the same solvent. Thus, the solvatochromic naphthalenes may display desired fluorescent properties not present in conventional sovlatochromic fluorophores. Due to the relatively planar and rigid structure of the functionalized naphthalenes of the present disclosure, combined with their light absorption and emission properties, in certain embodiments the functionalized naphthalenes may be used as a liquid crystal. Still further embodiments of the present disclosure provide methods for synthesizing the fluorescent functionalized naphthalenes described herein. According to the various embodiments, the methods comprise reacting a 2′-alkynyl substituted halostyrene by a dehydrogenative intramolecular dehydro Diels Alder reaction in the presence of microwave irradiation to form a halo substituted naphthalene; and reacting the halo substituted naphthalene to a cross coupling reaction to form a functionalized naphthalene having a structure according to Formula I, where R1 is a substituent selected from the group consisting of H, C1-C20 alkyl, C1-C20 alkoxy, phenyl, aryl, heteroaryl, —S(O)R4, —S(O)2R4, P(O)(OR4)2, and —C(Y)R4 where Y is O, NR5, or S; each R2 is a halogen or an electron donating group selected from —N(R6)2, —OR6, and —SR6; each R3 is H, C1-C20 alkyl, or combined as ═O; each R4, R5 and R6 is independently selected from H, C1-C20 alkyl, C1-C20 alkoxy, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, aryl, heteroaryl, benzyl, or may come together to form a cyclic structure; X is CH2, C(R6)2, C(CO2Alkyl)2, O, NTs, NH, NCOR5 or NR5; n is an integer from 0 to 2; m is an integer from 1 to 4, provided that either R1 is one of —S(O)R4, —S(O)2R4, P(O)(OR4)2, and —C(Y)R4 or the R3 groups are combined as ═O. In these embodiments, the 2′ alkynyl substituted halostyrene may have a structure as shown herein, for example where the alkyl may be substituted, the tether between the styryl double bond and the alkyne may have substitution and functionality (such as a carbonyl, ether, amine, amide, gem-diester, or alkyl substitution), and the aromatic ring may be substituted with a chlorine or a variety of other groups represented by R2. As described herein the cross coupling reaction converts the halogen on the halo substituted naphthalene to an electron donating group, such as a group selected from —N(R6)2, —OR6, and —SR6. Examples of cross coupling reactions include transition metal mediated cross coupling reactions, such as a palladium catalyst in the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction. According to various embodiments of the described methods, the functionalized naphthalenes may have a structure where R1 is —S(O)R4, —S(O)2R4, P(O)(OR4)2, or —C(Y)R4, Y is O or NR5 and R4 and R5 are independently H, C1-C20 alkyl, C1-C20 alkoxy, phenyl, or aryl, and each R2 is Cl, —N(R6)2, or —OR6, where each R6 is H, C1-C20 alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, or come together to form a cyclyl or heterocyclyl structure having 4-5 carbon atoms. According to specific embodiments of the methods, the functionalized naphthalene may have a structure According to still other embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods for fluorescing a fluorescent functionalized naphthalene having a structure according to any of the embodiments described herein. For example, the functionalized naphthalene may have a structure where R1 is a substituent selected from the group consisting of H, C1-C20 alkyl, C1-C20 alkoxy, phenyl, aryl, heteroaryl, —S(O)R4, —S(O)2R4, P(O)(OR4)2, and —C(Y)R4 where Y is O, NR5, or S; each R2 is a halogen or an electron donating group selected from —N(R6)2, —OR6, and —SR6; each R3 is H, C1-C20 alkyl, or combined as ═O; each R4, R5 and R6 is independently selected from H, C1-C20 alkyl, C1-C20 alkoxy, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, aryl, heteroaryl, benzyl, or may come together to form a cyclic structure; X is CH2, C(R6)2, C(CO2Alkyl)2, O, NTs, NH, NCOR5 or NR5; n is an integer from 0 to 2; m is an integer from 1 to 4, provided that either R1 is one of —S(O)R4, —S(O)2R4, P(O)(OR4)2, and —C(Y)R4 or the R3 groups are combined as ═O. According to the various embodiments of these methods, the method may comprise the steps of irradiating the functionalized naphthalene with electromagnetic radiation and measuring the amount of fluorescent light emitted by the irradiated functionalized naphthalene. In specific embodiments the fluorescent light emitted by the irradiated functionalized naphthalene may have a emission maximum at a wavelength from 450 nm to 650 nm. In still other embodiments, the functionalized, substituted naphthalenes of the present disclosure may have a structure where the naphthalene has a group(s) attached either directly or indirectly, for example, via a tether, that is capable of forming a bond with another molecule or substrate. The bond may be a covalent bond or an ionic bond. According to these embodiments, the other molecule or substrate may be “tagged” with the functionalized naphthalene. For example, according to embodiments where the functionalized naphthalene has fluorescent properties, the naphthalene may act as a fluorescent tag, wherein the tagged substrate or molecule fluoresces at a wavelength determined by the presence of the tagging functionalized naphthalene. The tagging naphthalenes may be used to tag various substrates, such as organic compounds, inorganic compounds, proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids, other cellular components and the like. According to specific embodiments, functionalized naphthalenes having a group capable of forming a bond with another substrate may include a carboxylic acid, ester, amide, diol, triazole, thiol, or other known tagging functional groups. Non-limiting examples of substituted naphthalene structures that have a functional group capable of tagging are illustrated in Scheme 5. According to various embodiments, the present disclosure provides attachable solvatochromic fluorophores suitable for bioconjugation studies. The skeletons of the naphthalene fluorophores may be chemically modified to include reactive functional groups which have minimal affect or alteration of the optical properties of the modified compounds when compared to the parent dyes. The functionalized fluorophores may be covalently attached to the carboxyl group of a fatty acid, and azido- and thiol-containing amino acids, demonstrating their potential for labeling biomolecules. As shown in Scheme 6, Functionalization of R1 in 103a with a variety of groups is possible and should afford compounds with the same photophysical properties as naphthalene were R1═CH3 and R2═H. Attachment of functional groups and/or biomolecules to the five membered ring, as in 103a′, is also predicted to have little effect on the photophysical properties because this ring is not conjugated with the chromophore. Regarding attachment sites for fluorophore 102b, R1 on the appended aryl ring may be synthetically appealing. In addition, the aryl ring will have little effect on the absorption and emission maxima of the parent dye. A hydroxyl group was selected as a reactive functionality for labeling fluorophores 103a, 103a′ and 103b because of its synthetic versatility, i.e. nucleophilic substitutions, oxidations, and Mitsunobu reactions, however other functional groups such as amines, carboxylate groups, amides, thiols etc. could also be used. A microwave-assisted intramolecular DDDA reaction of styrenes 4a, 4b, and 4c afforded cyclopenta[b]naphthalenes 5a, 5b, and 5c in 85%, 47% and 92% yield, respectively (Scheme 7). A low yield for the conversion of 4b to 5b was attributed to the bulky tert-butyl group. The resulting aryl chlorides 5a, 5b and 5c were subjected to palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling amination conditions to isolate the protected fluorophores 6a-d in 62%, 58%, 71%, and 35% yield, respectively. Reaction conditions for the conversion of 5c to pyrrolidine 6d were not optimized. The ketal groups of compounds 6a-c were removed by treatment with 1N HCl to afford diols 7a-c in 57%, 96%, and 52% yield, respectively. Tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF, 2 equiv) in THF was used to deprotect the TBS groups of substrate 6d to afford 7c in quantitative yield. Absorption and emission maxima of 6a-d and 7a-c were measured in dichloromethane (DCM) revealing interesting trends. Changes to the amine and ketone groups influences the photophysical properties of these fluorophores, as evidenced by the emission maxima for 6a (566 nm), 6b (527 nm), and 6d (581 nm). However, variations to the diol moiety had almost no effect on the optical properties of these dyes. In fact, the ketal derivative 6a, the TBS protected compound 6c, and the free diol 7a showed almost identical fluorescence emission maxima (566 nm, 564 nm, and 567 nm respectively) and only slight changes in the absorption maxima were observed. The diol group of 7a-c was considered for the fluorescent labeling of carboxyl groups. To demonstrate this, the fatty acid derivative 8 was obtained through a coupling reaction of 7b with 10-undecenoic acid and dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC, Scheme 1). The optical properties of fluorophore 8 were found to be comparable to that of substrate 7b with an absorption maximum of 324 nm, emission maximum of 531 nm, and a Stokes shift of 207 nm in DCM. This unusual fatty acid derivative 8 is being examined for its potential to study membrane structure. To widen the applicability and to show the versatility of these dyes as labels for biological targets, efforts turned to the labeling of 103a (Scheme 6). This was accomplished by reacting amide 9 and the lithium acetylide of alkyne 10 to produce the DDDA precursor 11 in 58% yield (Scheme 8). Subjecting 11 to the DDDA reaction conditions followed by a Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reaction generated the TBS-protected fluorescent compound 12 in a 53% overall yield. Deprotection of the TBS group with TBAF afforded the attachable fluorophore 13 in 91% yield. This synthetic protocol allows for the preparation of additional fluorophores with tethers of varying lengths and conformational mobility between the carbonyl and the reactive hydroxyl group. With regards to optical properties, the TBS-protected and hydroxyl derivatives 12 and 13 showed absorption and emission maxima in DCM comparable to those observed for fluorophore 102a. The final labeling strategy is depicted as 103b (Scheme 6). Analogs of fluorophore 102b are especially attractive because this fluorophore displays an absorption maximum in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum (425 nm). In a manner entirely analogous to the preparation of other DDDA precursors described herein, 14a and 14b were prepared, isolated and subjected to microwave irradiation to produce fluorescent dyes 15a and 15b in 30% and 40% yield for the three steps (Scheme 9). These compounds displayed similar optical properties when compared with dye 102b. Solvatochromic properties of fluorescent naphthalenes 7b, 13 and 15b, including bathochromic shift are presented in Table 3.

According to other embodiments, the present disclosure provides an approach to the synthesis of unnatural amino acids comprising a functionalized fluorescent naphthalene moiety. As shown in Scheme 10, unnatural amino acids derived from serine derived amino acid 18 and an azide derived amino acid 21 were prepared and demonstrate fluorescent compounds. The fluorescent modified unnatural amino acids may be used to tag peptide and proteins with a fluorophore as described herein to produce tagged peptides or proteins that may be monitored in vitro or in vivo. The present disclosure also provides for a tagged fluorescent peptide or protein comprising a residue of an unnatural amino acid. In still other embodiments, the present disclosure provides for fluorescent fatty acid analogs where one or more fatty acid chains are attached to the fluorescent naphthalene structure. For example, in one embodiment, a fatty acid residue may be attached to a free hydroxyl group on the substituted fluorescent naphthalene to form a fatty acid ester substituted naphthalene. Alternatively, the fatty acid residue may be attached to a primary or secondary amine on the naphthalene to form a fatty amide residue on the substituted naphthalene. One example of this approach is illustrated in Scheme 11. According to other embodiments, the de novo chemical synthesis and fluorophore design strategy described herein will be used to prepare near infra red-infra red (“NIR-IR”) solvatochromic membrane probes. For a first generation of compounds, the position of the electron-donating groups on the cyclopenta[b]naphthalene ring have been altered and varied the R group (H, Ph, TMS), for example to include heavy atom groups and NMR active groups, such as silyl (trimethyl silyl, triphenylsilyl, diphenyl methyl and alkoxy silyl groups), phosphorous groups, and NMR active isotopes such as 19F, 2H, 13C, or 31P. In specific embodiments, the substituted naphthalenes may be labeled with an NMR active isotope, such as 19F, 2H, 13C, or 31P, and may be used as an NMR probe, for example as a membrane sensor using NMR to analyze interactions between the active isotope and its surroundings. In specific embodiments, altering the position of the dimethylamino group may lead to a red-shifted emission of from 100 nm to 140 nm or more. In addition, by changing the R group from a hydrogen to a silyl (trimethylsilyl (TMS)) group or other heavy atom group, such as a phosphorous containing group, the absorption and emission wavelengths are both been significantly red-shifted (Scheme 12). In addition, the TMS-substituted is the most intensely fluorescent compound in this series. For a few of these substrates the Stokes shift was increased significantly, a desired property since this may inhibit self-quenching. Thus, the present disclosure provides substituted naphthalene fluorophores having large Stokes shifts, while maintaining fluorescent intensity. Conventional bright dyes do not typically display large Stokes shifts, so one approach in the art is to connect multiple fluorophores with energy donor-acceptor architectures together so that can achieve large pseudo-Stokes shifts, collectively call energy transfer cassettes. In contrast, specific embodiments of the naphthalene fluorophores described herein may show the large Stokes shift and high intensity while having small molecular structures that may be attached without significant change in the molecular environment of the tagged molecule. Still other embodiments of the substituted naphthalene fluorophores may either absorb or emit in the NIR-IR or both. For these fluorophores, the absorption spectra has been shifted well into the visible region (442 nm) and emission spectra is red-shifted by up to 100 nm when compared to conventional lipid membrane sensor, Laurdan. Thus, fluorophores described herein may display lower in phototoxicity and may be more amenable to routine confocal microscopy; whereas conventional Laurdan requires the use of a more expensive less available two-photon microscope. Finally, the solvatochromic dyes described herein may circumvent issue of FRET biosensors such as they do not require two partners in close proximity or very specific arrangement. In other embodiments, the substituted naphthalene fluorophores described herein may act as a NIR-IR solvatochromic sensor for monitoring membrane function in living systems, such as those fluorophores that involve structures with increased aromatic groups on a silicon moiety (such as triphenylsilyl), changing the electron donating group, for example to primary amines to give higher quantum yields. However, because reactivity of amines (protonation, oxidation) in general can be problematic, certain embodiments of the naphthalenes may incorporate an alternative electron-releasing/donating group. In other embodiments, solubility of the naphthalene fluorophore may be manipulated, for example by attaching a polar substituent, such as a carboxylic acid, ammonium salt, sulfonic acid group and the like onto the sensor structure. According to other embodiment, extending the conjugated system of the fluorophores herein, as it is believed that more conjugation can lead to shifts to longer wavelengths. For example, in cyanine dyes, every methylene that is added to the chromophore component results in a wavelength that is red-shifted by 100 nm. Still other embodiments may include incorporation of rotationally restricted groups on the fluorophores to increase the quantum yields. In other embodiments, the naphthalene structures may incorporate heterocyclic substituents as recognition elements for molecular imaging.

Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about”. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the specifications and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present disclosure. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. All numerical ranges stated herein include all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of “1 to 10” is intended to include all sub-ranges between and including the recited minimum value of 1 and the recited maximum value of 10. Any maximum numerical limitation recited herein is intended to include all lower numerical limitations. Any minimum numerical limitation recited herein is intended to include all higher numerical limitations. The terms “a,” “an,” “the” and similar referents used in the context of describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context. Recitation of ranges of values herein is merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range. Unless otherwise indicated herein, each individual value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. All methods described herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language (e.g., “such as”) provided herein is intended merely to better illuminate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention otherwise claimed. No language in the specification should be construed as indicating any non-claimed element essential to the practice of the invention. Groupings of alternative elements or embodiments of the invention disclosed herein are not to be construed as limitations. Each group member may be referred to and claimed individually or in any combination with other members of the group or other elements found herein. It is anticipated that one or more members of a group may be included in, or deleted from, a group for reasons of convenience and/or patentability. When any such inclusion or deletion occurs, the specification is deemed to contain the group as modified thus fulfilling the written description of all Markush groups used in the appended claims. Certain embodiments of this invention are described herein, including the best mode known to the inventors for carrying out the invention. Of course, variations on these described embodiments will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the foregoing description. The inventor expects skilled artisans to employ such variations as appropriate, and the inventors intend for the invention to be practiced otherwise than specifically described herein.
