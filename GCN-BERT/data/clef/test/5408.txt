DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the present invention. In this regard, no attempt is made to show details of the present invention in more detail than is necessary for the fundamental understanding of the present invention, the description in combination with the drawings making apparent to those of skill in the art how the several forms of the present invention may be embodied in practice. FIG. 1 shows a respirator (1). The respirator (1) is provided with an indicating device (2), at least one operating element (3) and also a tube connection (4). The tube connection (4) typically serves for connection to a respiratory gas tube (not represented), which is connected in the region of its extent that is away from the tube connection (4) to a breathing mask that is likewise not represented. The breathing mask that is not represented serves for supplying respiratory gas to a patient, who is likewise not represented. An electrical connection (not represented) for heating a respiratory tube may be optionally provided in the region of the tube connection. The respirator (1) is typically provided with at least one communication interface (6). Here, the interface (6) is arranged in a side region. The interface (6) is inclined in relation to the horizontal and is in the spatial vicinity of the display. The respirator preferably also has an interface (6โฒ) that serves for the coupling of modules (8). In the case of the exemplary embodiment represented, the respirator (1) is coupled with a respiratory gas humidifier (7). The respirator (1) may be operated optionally both with and without the respiratory gas humidifier (7). According to the embodiment represented in FIG. 1, the housing of the respirator (1) has a triangular cross-sectional area in a vertical sectional plane. According to the embodiment in FIG. 1, additional elements (8), which provide at least one further device function, can be coupled to the respirator (1) as and when required. The display (13) is formed here as a user interface, for example as a touchscreen, of the respirator (1). In the region of the display (13), a number of input buttons configured for receiving a user input are provided. The display (13) is connected by logic circuitry to the buttons and has a number of information fields, wherein each information field is assigned to a corresponding input button and configured for indicating graphic items of information that specify various functions of the corresponding input buttons. The input buttons are touch-sensitive areas in the region of the display (13). According to the invention, at least one further operating element (3) is provided. This operating element (3) can be operated mechanically, and consequently differs from the touch areas on the display. According to the invention, the respirator is switched on and off by means of the operating element (3), so that a basic patient-specific therapy can be activated by means of just one button. For this purpose, the operating element (3) is connected by logic circuitry to the blower motor and activates it, and also the memory, in order to retrieve and apply stored therapy data, such as pressure values. In addition, adaptation of individual values, such as pressure values, may take place by means of the input buttons. However, according to the invention, it is not necessary to use the input buttons to operate the touchscreen (13) in order to start the therapy. According to the embodiment represented in FIG. 2, in the case of the arrangement of the device according to FIG. 1 the respiratory gas humidifier (7) has been removed from the respirator (1). It is evident from looking at FIG. 1 together with FIG. 2 that, irrespective of the use of a respiratory gas humidifier (7), the same tube connection (4) can always be used. It is consequently not necessary to change over the respiratory tube according to the device function. FIG. 3 illustrates that, with regard to its basic mechanical structure, the respirator (1) consists of two components. They are a front unit (1a), with the operating element (3) and the indicating device (2), and the blower box (5), with a front part (16), a supporting part (11) with the blower (9) and a rear part (17). The front part (16) and the rear part (17) enclose an interior device space (18) in the manner of shells. Inserted into the housing parts (16) and (17) are sound-damping materials (16โฒ and 17โฒ), preferably of a foam material. FIGS. 3 and 3 a show the respirator (1) broken down into the components that are the blower box (5) and the front unit (1a). The easy handling during the assembly of the components is evident from the figures. Apart from the housing, the front unit (1a) includes inter alia an indicating device (2), an operating element (3) and a control board (23), and also at least two interfaces. The front unit (1a) is preferably inclined in relation to the vertical and includes the indicating device (2), at least one operating element (3) and at least one control board (23), which is arranged parallel to the indicating device (2), and also at least two interfaces. The assembly of the front unit (1a) with the blower box (5) is performed by means of hooks (1b) on the front unit (1a), which engage behind regions (5a) of the blower box (5). The front unit is swung in by means of the pivot point comprising the hooks (1b) and the regions (5a). In addition, a catch (5b) arranged on the blower box (5) engages in an opening (1c) in the front unit (1a). To secure it, the front unit (1a) is connected to the blower box (5) by just 2 screws, and thereby forms the housing of the respirator (1). To release the front unit (1a) from the blower box (5), all that is necessary is to loosen the screws and disengage the catch (5b). According to the embodiment in FIG. 4, a blower (9) is arranged within the blower box (5). The blower (9) is typically driven by an electric motor (10). To assist easy assembly and disassembly, the blower (9) may be secured by aโpreferably elastic or viscoelasticโsupporting part (11), which can be inserted into the blower box (5). To assist structure-borne sound decoupling, the blower (9) is connected to the supporting part (11) by a likewise (visco)elastic coupling element (12). The supporting part (11) and the coupling element (12) are preferably formed as one part. They may for example be made of an elastomeric material. Elastomeric materials have the advantage that they have both elastic and viscous properties, and consequently absorb vibrational energy or convert it into heat. According to a preferred embodiment, the coupling element (12) surrounds the blower (9) in the manner of a frame. Depending on the respective application requirements, the coupling element (12) may be designed in the manner of a ring. The coupling element (12) preferably has a bead or a similar design elementโfor example similar to elastic suspension elements that are used in the case of loudspeakersโin order to be able to absorb vibrations better over a longer decoupling path. The blower (9) is elastically suspended in the space inside the device by the (visco)elastic coupling element (12) and/or the supporting part (11). As a result, structure-borne sound transmission to the housing (1, 16, 17) is effectively avoided. In addition, elastic spacing elements (27), which are preferably formed as one part with the coupling element (12) and/or the supporting part (11), may be provided, effectively avoiding contact of the blower with the housing (1, 16, 17). For this purpose, the spacing elements may be provided on one side or both sides of the coupling element (12) and/or the supporting part (11) and extend for example in the vertical direction. The supporting part (11) with the coupling element (12) preferably consists of a viscoelastic material, for example of silicone. Apart from the coupling element (12), the supporting part (11) includes various air openings (11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4), in order to achieve a longer air path, and consequently a further reduction of the noise. Further redirections of the flow can also be achieved by means of the coupling element. Apart from receiving the blower (9) and the specifically intended gas flow through the interior device space (18) of the blower box (5), which is illustrated in FIG. 5, the supporting part (11) also serves for providing the seal between the housing parts (16) and (17). The outer contour of the supporting part (11) receives the contour of the housing parts (16 and 17) and thus provides a seal between the housing parts (16 and 17) in the peripheral region. The supporting part (11) is preferably clamped or fitted vertically between the housing parts (16 and 17) and held by fixing the housing parts (16 and 17) against one another (for example by screwing). The viscoelastic properties of the supporting part (11) thus have the effect that the housing parts (16 and 17) are sealed. For this purpose, the supporting part has a seal (30), which for example runs around the periphery or is interrupted, and is for example formed as an edge. The housing parts (16 and 17) have sealing surfaces (31, 32) that complement the sealing edge (30). The supporting part (11) serves for directing the air flows and for this purpose has openings or apertures (11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4). The supporting part (11) likewise serves for sound damping and for this purpose has a collar (28) at least on one of the openings (11.4). The supporting part (11) likewise serves for sound decoupling and securing the blower and is therefore produced from an elastomeric material and for this purpose has a coupling element (12) for securing the blower. The coupling element (12) may also have beads, to avoid the transmission of structure-borne sound. The supporting part (11) also has at least one seal (30) for providing a seal of the housing parts (16 and 17) with respect to the surroundings by means of the sealing surfaces (31, 32) and a further seal (33) for providing a seal of the intake region and the high-pressure region by means of the sealing surfaces (34, 35). The supporting part is also formed as one part and is held between the housing parts (16 and 17) by clamping or bracing or screwing. FIG. 4 a shows the supporting part (11) in a further view. Here, the intake region (9โฒ) and the air outlet (9โณ) of the blower (9) can be seen. An additional foam-material element (11โฒ), which is held on the supporting part (11) by means of a lug (11โณ), serves for redirecting the air, and consequently for reducing noise. FIG. 5 illustrates a typical air flow through the blower box (5). According to A, air is sucked in through an intake opening in the rear part (16) and, according to B, flows through the opening (11.1) in the supporting part (11). According to C, the air flow is redirected vertically through a chamber (17.1) in the front part (17) and passes through the opening (11.2) in the supporting part (11) back into the rear part (16), into the air chamber in the region (16.2). There, the air is redirected diagonally and, according to D, flows through the opening (11.3) and, diagonally redirected further according to E, in the region (9โฒ) flows into the blower (9). The air transported by the blower (9) leaves the blower through the air outlet (9โณ) according to F in the region (17.2) in the front part (17) and further according to G through the opening (11.4) in the supporting part (11). According to H, the air flow reaches the rear part (16) in the region (16.1), flows there through a flow measuring device and is redirected again according to I, and leaves the rear part (16) to a sound damper or to the respiratory gas humidifier. FIG. 6 shows the components according to FIG. 5 for a more detailed explanation of the mechanical construction without the flow arrows of the gas flow being depicted. The supporting part (11) preferably has at least one opening or an aperture (11.1, 11.2 . . . ), which serves for directing the air. The supporting part (11) preferably has at least one opening or an aperture (11.4), which is surrounded at least in certain portions by an elevated collar (28). The collar may be present on one or both sides of the aperture (11.4). The collar (28) is connected on one side to the supporting part (11) and serves for directing the air and damping airborne sound. The air transported by the blower (9) leaves the blower through the air outlet (9โณ). Just behind the air outlet, the accelerated air is redirected by approximately 90ยฐ by a flow redirecting feature (29), and is thus conducted in the direction of the aperture (11.4) with the collar (28). FIG. 7 shows the interior housing space (18) in the front part (17), with inserted sound-damping materials (17โฒ) and the air chambers (17.1) and (17.2). According to the invention, the air chambers (17.1) and (17.2) are the high-pressure region (17.1) and the low-pressure region or intake region (17.2). Correspondingly, the two housing parts (16, 17) respectively have the associated chamber halves of the high-pressure region (16.117.1) and the intake region (16.2, 17.2). For separating the high-pressure region (16.1, 17.1) and the intake region (16.2, 17.2) the supporting part (11) has a seal (33), which is clamped vertically between the housing parts (16 and 17) and is held by fixing the housing parts (16 and 17) against one another (for example by screwing). The housing parts (16 and 17) have sealing surfaces (34, 35) that complement the seal (33). Thus, the way in which the supporting part and the housing parts (16, 17) interact produces different spaces that are sealed with respect to one another. The supporting part (11) seals off the high-pressure region (16.1, 17.1) from the intake region (16.2, 17.2). The supporting part (11) also seals off the two housing parts (16, 17). This creates four chambers, which communicate with one another and direct the air through the openings (11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4). According to the embodiment in FIG. 8, the indicating device (2) is formed as a display (13). The display (13) is designed in the manner of a panel and is fixed within the housing (5) by means of a frame-like securing element (14). It is preferably envisaged to insert the display (13) into the securing element (14) and fix it in the securing element (14) by means of a clasp (14a). This serves for better fixing of the display in the housing, since the display is fitted into the housing while inverted, and without a clasp may slip. The securing element (14) is also designed in such a way that it can compensate for production tolerances of the display (13) by varying tensioning of the clasp (14a). The individual parts are represented in FIG. 9 and the preassembled unit comprising the display (13) and the securing element (14) is represented in FIG. 10. The preassembled unit is braced against the housing (5) by using screws (15). A seal (14b) is preferably arranged between the display (13) and the housing (1a). If a different display (13) is used, for example from a different manufacturer, in this embodiment only the securing element (14) need be adapted to the display; the housing structure can be retained. For example, the display may also be inserted into the front unit from the outside, the frame then being an integral part of this front part. In this embodiment, the front part is formed with the additional use of a front sheet or operating sheet, which is likewise placed onto the front element from the front, whereby the display is received and held between the housing part and the front sheet. In a once again preferred embodiment, the operating sheet substantially covers the externally visible part of the front part. As an alternative or in addition to the touch-sensitive areas on the display that are described further above, further operating functions may be integrated in the front sheet. FIG. 11 shows an embodiment in which the respirator (1) is provided with an additional element (8) formed as a communication module. The additional element (8) serves here for the connection to a polysomnography device (PSD) (19). Coupling of the PSD (19) may take place by using a cable (20), which can be coupled to an interface (22) of the additional element (8) by means of a connector (21). FIG. 12 shows a plan view of a control board (23), which can be arranged within the front unit (1a) of the respirator (1). The control board (23) assists a pressure measurement and is provided with a connectable tube (24) for passing on the pressure. According to the exemplary embodiment represented, the tube (24) consists of a first tube portion (25) of a first diameter and a second tube portion (26) of a second diameter. The first diameter is greater than the second diameter. The combination of the first tube portion (25) and the second tube portion (26) provides signal filtering, which in particular filters out harmonics present in the pressure signal. As an alternative to the filter taking a mechanical form provided by the tube portions (25, 26), electrical, electronic or software-based filtering is also possible in principle.
