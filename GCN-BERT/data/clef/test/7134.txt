Formulation 1 5 parts of the present amide compound, 5 parts of the present diamide compound (2b), 35 parts of the mixture of white carbon and polyoxyethylene alkylether sulfate anmmonium salts (weight ratio 1:1), and 55 parts of water are mixed and the resulting solution is then subjected to fine grinding according to a wet grinding method, so as to obtain a flowable formulation. The same above operations are carried out using the present diamide compound (2a) , the present diamide compound (2c) or the present diamide compound (3) instead of the present diamide compound (2b), so as to obtain flowable formulations. Formulation 2 10 parts of the present amide compound, 5 parts of the present diamide compound (2b) and 1.5 parts of sorbitan trioleate are mixed into 28 parts of an aqueous solution that contains 2 parts of polyvinyl alcohol, and the mixed solution is then subjected to fine grinding according to wet grinding method. Thereafter, 45.50 parts of an aqueous solution that contains 0.05 parts of xanthan gum and 0.1 part of aluminum magnesium silicate is added to the resultant, and 10 parts of, propylene glycol is further added thereto. The obtained mixture is blended by stirring, so as to obtain the flowable formulation. The same above operations are carried out using the present diamide compound (2a) , the present diamide compound (2c) or the present diamide compound (3) instead of the present diamide compound (2b), so as to obtain flowable formulations. Formulation 3 10 parts of the present amide compound, 40 parts of the present diamide compound (2b), 3 parts of calcium lignosulfonate, 2 parts of sodium lauryl sulfate, and 45 parts of synthetic hydrous silicon oxide are fully crushed and mixed, so as to obtain wettable powders. The same above operations are carried out using the present diamide compound (2a), the present diamide compound (2c) or the present .diamide compound (3) instead of the present diamide compound (2b), so as to obtain wettable powders. The test examples are given below. Test Examples 1 to 6 True leaf of cucumber was punched out with cork borer to 13mm in diameter to prepare a leaf disk. In 24 well microwell plate that was dispensed with 1ml 0.8% water agar, the leaf disk was placed such that the upper side of the leaf was in an upward direction. Thereto was spread 20 micro liter a testing solution prepared by mixing the present amide compound and the present diamide compound (2b) to a predetermined concentration (for treated group). Control where 20 micro liter ion-exchange water was spread was prepared (for non-treated group). After confirming that the spray solution was dried, conidium of gray mold fungus (Botrytis cinerea) was suspended into potato dextrose broth (DIFCO) in a density of about 105 conidia/mL and was then subjected to a spray inoculation. After, leaving to stand the leaf disk in a growth chamber set up at 15°C for six days, an onset area on each leaf was measured and a preventive value was then calculated by the following equation 1. The same above operations were carried out using the present diamide compound (2c) or the present diamide compound (3) instead of the present diamide compound (2b), so as to obtain the respective preventive values. (Equation 1) Preventive value (%) = 100 χ (Α-Β)/Α wherein A: an onset area rate of plant belonging to ηοηtreated group Β: an onset area rate of plant belonging to treated group onset area rate = (onset area of the leaf disk) /.(the total area of the leaf disk) The results are shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3.
