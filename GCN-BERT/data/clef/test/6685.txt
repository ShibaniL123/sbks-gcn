Step 4. 4-Bromo-3-fluoro-5-methylbenzaldehyde
To a solution of 2-bromo-1-fluoro-3-methyl-5-vinylbenzene (5.46 g, 25.4 mmol) in acetone (46 mL) and water (4.6 mL) was sequentially added sodium periodate (21.7 g, 102 mmol) and a 4% aqueous solution of osmium tetroxide (8.07 mL, 1.27 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at r.t. for 2 h. The reaction mixture was then filtered over a pad of Celite. The filtrate was diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by Biotage Isoleraâ„¢ (3.22 g, 58%).
