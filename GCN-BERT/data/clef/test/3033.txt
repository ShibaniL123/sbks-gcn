INTRODUCTION Cryptococcus fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are pathogenic fungi that are found world-wide. Cryptococcus neoformans causes meningoencephalitis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. It is invariably fatal unless treated, and the current antifungals are inadequate to effectively cure this disease, due to inherent toxicities or the inability to kill the fungus and prevent relapse. Recent studies have indicated that there are over 1,000,000 new cases of cryptococcosis in the world each year, which results in over 600,000 deaths. Cryptococcus neoformans is known to appear as an opportunistic infection in AIDS patients. The fungus Cryptococcus gattii also infects humans, and can cause pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary cryptococcosis, basal meningitis, and cerebral cryptococcomas. Cryptococcus gattii has also been associated with infections of skin, soft tissue, lymph node, bone, and joints. Cryptococcus gattii is also known to infect non-human mammals, such as dogs, cats, camelids, horses, sheep, goats, cows, koalas and dolphins (Lockhart, S. R., et al., PLOS ONE 8: issue 9 e74737, 2013). Banks, I. R., et al., Eukaryotic Cell 4; 1902-1912, 2005 discloses that a chitin synthase (CHS3) and its regulator protein (CSR2) are critical for chitosan production and growth in Cryptococcus neoformans. These authors show that deletions chs3Δ and csr2Δ are defective in chitosan production. Although this reference suggests that chitin synthesis could serve as an antifungal target, it does not teach nor suggest the use of the disclosed strains for vaccines against Cryptococcus infection. Baker, L. G., et al., Eukaryotic Cell 6: 855-867, 2007 discloses that chitosan, a deacetylated form of chitin, is necessary for cell wall integrity in Cryptococcus neoformans. These workers demonstrated that three deacetylases, Cda1, Cda2 and Cda3 can account for all chitosan produced during vegetative growth of Cryptococcus neoformans in culture. Several deletions of chitin deacetylases genes, including cda1Δ, cda2Δ, cda3Δ, cda1Δcda2Δ, cda1Δcda3Δ, cda2Δcda3Δ and cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ were described. However, none of these strains are described as conferring immunity against Cryptococcus neoformans infection. Baker, L. G., et al., Eukaryotic Cell 10: 1264-1268, 2011 discloses that Cryptococcus neoformans strains deleted for chitin deacetylases genes exhibit less virulence in mice. These authors show in a model system that intranasal inoculation of mice with wild type Cryptococcus neoformans reduced survival to 0% by 19 days, whereas intranasal inoculation with Cryptococcus neoformans having one or more genetic deletions in chitin deacetylase(s) did not lead to loss of survival over a 60 day period. However, the reference did not describe any vaccine against Cryptococcus infection or methods of conferring immunity against Cryptococcus infection. There is no effective vaccine against Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii (Datta, K., and Pirofski, L., FEMS Yeast Res. 6: 525-536, 2006). Compositions and methods for preventing Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii infection are needed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present inventors have developed vaccines and administration protocols against infection by Cryptococcus fungi, including Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. In various embodiments, a vaccine of the present teachings can provide significant protection against exposure to a virulent Cryptococcus strain, such as a wild type Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii, up to 100% protection. As used herein, an “inactivated” Cryptococcus refers to a Cryptococcus fungus that has been disabled or killed such that it is unable to reproduce upon infection of a host organism, or grow in a standard nutrient medium. Inactivation of a Cryptococcus, including Cryptococcus deficient for chitosan production, can be accomplished by any method known to skilled artisans. In various configurations, an inactivated Cryptococcus fungus of the present teachings can comprise heat-killed or heat-attenuated Cryptococcus, such as but not limited to heat-killed C. neoformans cda1Δ, C. neoformans cda2ΔC. neoformans cda3Δ, C. neoformans chs3Δ, C. neoformans csr2Δ or any combination thereof, such as, without limitation C. neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ. In various configurations, an inactivated Cryptococcus fungus of the present teachings can comprise heat-killed or heat-attenuated Cryptococcus, such as but not limited to heat-killed C. gattii cda1Δ, C. gattii cda2Δ C. gattii cda3Δ, C. gattii chs3Δ, C. gattii csr2Δ or any combination thereof, such as, without limitation C. gattii cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ. In some configurations, an inactivated Cryptococcus strain deficient for chitosan production can comprise Cryptococcus that is deficient for chitosan production and has been killed by exposure to heat, to electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light, gamma ray radiation, or x-ray radiation, by exposure to nuclear radiation such as exposure to an alpha particle emitting source or a beta particle emitting source, by exposure to toxic levels of one or more chemicals, by photodynamic inactivation (Rodrigues, G. B., et al., Photochemistry and Photobiology 88:440-447, 2012; Fuchs, B. B., et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 51: 2929-2936, 2007), or any combination thereof. In some configurations, effectiveness of an inactivating treatment can be tested by plating treated samples on nutrient plates under standard conditions; a treatment can be considered inactivating if no colony forming units develop. Methods and compositions described herein utilize laboratory techniques well known to skilled artisans, and can be found in laboratory manuals such as Sambrook, J., et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 2001; Spector, D. L. et al., Cells: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1998; Nagy, A., Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual (Third Edition), Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 2003 and Harlow, E., Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1999. Methods of administration of pharmaceuticals and dosage regimes, can be determined according to standard principles of pharmacology well known skilled artisans, using methods provided by standard reference texts such as Remington: the Science and Practice of Pharmacy (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed. 19th ed. 1995); Hardman, J. G., et al., Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Ninth Edition, McGraw-Hill, 1996; and Rowe, R. C., et al., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, Fourth Edition, Pharmaceutical Press, 2003. As used in the present description and any appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context indicates otherwise. In various embodiments, a Cryptococcus fungus, including without limitation Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii comprising mutations in at least one, at least two, or at least three chitin deacetylase (cda)genes and/or chitin synthase genes and/or chitin synthase regulator genes can be obtained and grown by established procedures (See, e.g., Baker, L. G., et al., Eukaryotic Cell 6: 855-867, 2007 and Baker, L. G., et al., Eukaryotic Cell 10: 1264-1268, 2011). A mutation can interfere with, inactivate, or eliminate a gene or its encoded protein product. In various embodiments, a Cryptococcus fungus, including without limitation either Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii of the present teachings deficient for chitosan can be obtained and grown by established procedures. In various embodiments, Cryptococcus neoformans strains of the present teachings can comprise the following DNA sequences. C. neoformans CDA1 (CNAG—05799): Wild type gene: Bolded regions are predicted introns. The sequences between the double-underlined sequences are deleted in the deletion strain. GGCCCTCTACTCTACCTTCG (SEQ ID No:1) and GCCGCCTCTAACACTTCTTCC (SEQ ID No:2) are the primer sequences used for deletion. The residues in bold and italicized typeface are the sites used for creating active site mutants. In some configurations, selectable markers (not indicated) can be inserted in place of the deleted portions.

Unless specifically presented in the past tense, an example can be a prophetic or an actual example. The following non-limiting examples are provided to further illustrate the present teachings. Those of skill in the art, in light of the present disclosure, will appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments that are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the present teachings. Example 1 This example illustrates that exposure of mice to a composition of the present teachings confers immunity to Cryptococcus infection in a model system. In these experiments, illustrated in FIG. 1A, a group of 5 mice were inoculated through nasal inhalation with 107 Cryptococcus neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ. These mice were challenged with 105 wild type (strain KN99) at day 38 post inoculation. At 70 days post inoculation, 100% of these mice were alive. In contrast, 100% of a control group of 4 mice that had not been inoculated with Cryptococcus neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ were dead within 15 days after being challenged with 105 wild type Cryptococcus neoformans (strain KN99). These data demonstrate the effectiveness of inhalation exposure to Cryptococcus neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ for conferring immunity to Cryptococcus neoformans infection. In a second experiment, ten CBA/J mice were vaccinated with 107 of a live preparation of cda1Δ2Δ3Δ cells. After 40 days post vaccination, the vaccinated mice and a group of ten naTve CBA/J mice were challenged with 100,000 of C. neoformans cells. FIG. 1B shows that 100% of the vaccinated mice survived to 80 days post infection, while 100% of the naïve mice were dead by 20 days post infection. Example 2 This example illustrates preparation and use of heat-killed Cryptococcus deficient for chitosan production for conferring immunity against Cryptococcus infection. In these experiments, a suspension of Cryptococcus neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) is heated to 80° C. for 30 minutes. Test platings on nutrient medium are used to confirm the loss of viability of these Cryptococcus neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ. Test mice are exposed to these heat-killed fungi as in Example 1. These animals can survive a challenge infection with wild type Cryptococcus neoformans. Such experiments can show that heat-killed Cryptococcus deficient for chitosan production can be effective for conferring immunity, with efficacy similar to that obtained using live Cryptococcus neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ. Example 3 This example illustrates that inactivated Cryptococcus neoformans deficient for chitosan production is effective as a vaccine against C. neoformans infection in a mouse model system. In these experiments, C. neoformans fungi (strain KN99), and C. neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ subjected to heat-killing. For each strain, heating was applied until samples formed no colonies on standard nutrient plates. 5 mice were inoculated by nasal administration with 105 heat-killed KN99, and 5 mice were inoculated by nasal administration with 107 heat-killed C. neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ. The inoculated mice and 10 naïve control mice were challenged with 105 wild type C. neoformans KN9940 days after inoculation. As shown in FIG. 2A, no naïve mice or mice treated with heat-killed KN99 survived more than 18 days after exposure to wild type C. neoformans. In contrast, 100% of mice inoculated with heat-killed C. neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ survived more than 70 days after exposure to wild type C. neoformans. In a second experiment, ten CBA/J mice were vaccinated with 107 of a heat-killed preparation of wild type (KN99) cells and ten CBA/J mice were vaccinated with 107 of a heat-killed preparation of cda1Δ2Δ3Δ cells. Ten phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vaccinated mice served as control. After 40 days post vaccination, all mice were challenged with 100,000 of C. neoformans cells. FIG 2B shows that 100% of mice vaccinated with heat attenuated C. neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ live to 100 days post infection. In contrast, no mice vaccinated with PBS or heat-killed wild type C. neoformans cells live to 20 days post infection. These data demonstrate that heat-killed C. neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ can confer immunity to C. neoformans infection. Example 4 This example illustrates vaccination of a human subject against infection by Cryptococcus neoformans. In this example, Cryptococcus neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ is grown by standard protocols. The fungi are pelleted and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline 3 times. Following the final resuspension, the Cryptococcus neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ suspension is administered to a human subject via a nasal spray. The subject does not subsequently develop a Cryptococcus neoformans infection for at least one year. Example 5 This example illustrates vaccination of an animal subject against infection by Cryptococcus gattii. In this example, Cryptococcus gattii cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ is grown by standard protocols. The fungi are pelleted and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline 3 times. Following the final resuspension, the Cryptococcus gattii cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ suspension is administered to a dog subject via a nasal spray. The dog does not subsequently develop a Cryptococcus gattii infection for at least one year. Example 6 This example illustrate conferral of immunity to C. neoformans by administration of C. neoformans cda1Δ. In these experiments, as illustrated in FIG. 3, 4 CBA/J female mice (4-6 weeks of age) were subjected to an immunization schedule using nasal administration of a live preparation of 106 Cryptococcus neoformans cda1Δ. At −54 days, the mice were placed in laboratory housing. At −40 days, the mice were each vaccinated with 105 C. neoformans cda1Δ. At day 0 (40 days post vaccination), the mice were exposed to 105 KN99 (wild-type C. neoformans). As a control, 10 naïve mice were subjected to the same schedule but were not vaccinated before the challenge with KN99. Weight of the mice was monitored; animals were euthanized when weight fell below 75% of starting weight. The results of the challenge are shown in FIG. 4. The data indicate that the 100% of naïve mice were dead in less than 20 days after exposure to C. neoformans KN99, but that 100% of vaccinated mice remained alive more than 50 days after exposure to C. neoformans KN99. These data demonstrate effectiveness of nasal administration of C. neoformans cda1Δ for vaccination against C. neoformans infection. Example 7 This example illustrates conferral of immunity to C. gattii by administration of C. neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ. In these experiments, 10 CBA/J mice were vaccinated with 107 of a heat-killed preparation of C. neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ by nasal administration, while an additional 5 naïve mice were kept as controls. The vaccinated mice and the naïve control mice were exposed to Cryptococcus gattii strain R265. As illustrated in FIG. 5, all of the naïve mice were dead by 21 days after exposure to C. gattii R265. In contrast, 100% of mice inoculated with C. neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ were alive at 21 days after exposure to C. gattii R265. Survival extended to over 30 days in the vaccinated mice. These data survival at least partial protection against C. gattii infection by administration of C. neoformans deficient for chitin deacetylase. Example 8 This example illustrates conferral of immunity to C. gattii by administration of C. neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ. In these experiments, 10 CBA/J mice were vaccinated with 107 of a heat-killed preparation of C. neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ by nasal administration, while an additional 5 naïve mice were kept as controls. The vaccinated mice and the naïve control mice were exposed to Cryptococcus gattii strain WM266 40 days post vaccination. As illustrated in FIG. 6, all of the naïve mice were dead by 21 days after exposure to C. gattii WM266. In contrast, 100% of mice inoculated with C. neoformans cda1Δcda2Δcda3Δ were alive at 21 days after exposure to C. gattii WM266. Survival extended to over 30 days in the vaccinated mice. These data demonstrate at least partial protection against C. gattii infection by administration of C. neoformans deleted for chitin deacetylases genes. Example 9 This example illustrates the induction of protective response to C. neoformans infection in 129 mice after vaccination with heat-killed cda1Δ2Δ3Δ. In these experiments, five 129 mice were vaccinated with 107 heat-killed preparation of wild type (KN99) and five 129 mice were vaccinated with 107 heat-killed preparation of cda1Δ2Δ3Δ cells by nasal administration. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vaccinated mice served as control. After 40 days post vaccination, mice were challenged with 50,000 of C. neoformans cells. FIG. 7 illustrates the survival of 129 mice vaccinated with heat-killed cda1Δ2Δ3Δ. As with other mouse strains, 100% of the mice vaccinated with cda1Δ2Δ3Δ survived for 80 days post challenge, while controls vaccinated with wild type Cryptococcus or PBS died about 20 days after C. neoformans challenge. Example 10 This example illustrates the induction of protective response to C. neoformans infection in A/J mice after vaccination with heat-killed cda1Δ2Δ3Δ cells by nasal administration. In these experiments, five A/J mice were vaccinated with 107 of a heat-killed preparation of wild type (KN99) and five A/J mice were vaccinated with 107 of a heat-killed preparation of cda1Δ2Δ3Δ cells by nasal administration. Five phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vaccinated mice served as a control. After 40 days post vaccination, all mice were challenged with 50,000 of C. neoformans cells. FIG. 8 illustrates that 100% of mice vaccinated with heat-killed cda1Δ2Δ3Δ cells survived for 80 days after challenge with C. neoformans cells. In contrast, controls vaccinated with PBS or heat-killed KN99 died within 20 days of challenge with C. neoformans cells. Example 11 This example illustrates the induction of protective response to C. neoformans infection in BALB/c mice after vaccination with heat-killed cda1Δ2Δ3Δ. In these experiments, five BALB/c mice were vaccinated with 107 of a heat-killed preparation of wild type (KN99) and five BALB/c mice were vaccinated with 107 of a heat-killed preparation of cda1Δ2Δ3Δ cells by nasal administration. Five phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vaccinated mice served as a control. After 40 days post vaccination, mice were challenged with 50,000 of C. neoformans cells. FIG. 9 illustrates that 100% of mice vaccinated with cda1Δ2Δ3Δ cells lived at least 40 days post challenge, with over 60% surviving to 80 days. In contrast, 100% of mice vaccinated with PBS or heat-killed wild type cells died shortly after 20 days post challenge. Example 12 This example illustrates the fungal burden in the lungs of cda1Δ2Δ3Δ vaccinated mice that exhibited complete protection when challenged with Cryptococcus neoformans. In these experiments, several strains of mice were vaccinated by nasal administration with a preparation of 107 heat-killed cda1Δ2Δ3Δ cells. After 40 days post vaccination, the mice were challenged with 50,000 of wild type (KN99) C. neoformans cells in experiments discussed infra. At the conclusion of each of these experiments, surviving mice were sacrificed. Lungs were homogenized and plated onto fungal media to determine the CFU of C. neoformans still present in the lungs. FIG. 10 illustrates the fungal burden for each strain. Example 13 This example illustrates the induction of a protective response to C. neoformans infection in CBA/J mice after vaccination with a heat-killed preparation of wild type cells grown in Yeast Nitrogen Base medium (YNB) buffered to pH 7.0. In these experiments, five CBA/J mice were vaccinated by nasal administration with a preparation of 107 heat-killed of wild type cells grown in Yeast Nitrogen Base medium buffered to pH 7.0 with 50 mM 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) and five CBA/J mice were vaccinated with 107 of a heat-killed preparation of cda1Δ2Δ3Δ cells. Five phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vaccinated mice served as control. After 40 days post vaccination, mice were challenged with 50,000 of C. neoformans cells. FIG. 11 illustrates that mice vaccinated with heat-killed wild type cells that were grown in YNB medium pH 7.0 survive to 50 days post challenge at the same rate as cda1Δ2Δ3Δ vaccinated mice. Mice vaccinated with PBS in this experiment did not survive to 20 days post challenge. Example 14 This example illustrates the relative chitosan levels of different C. neoformans strains isolated from mouse lungs. Wild type (KN99) and cda1Δ were inoculated (100,000 cells) to mouse lungs by nasal inhalation. The lungs were excised 16 days post infection. C. neoformans cells were isolated from the lung homogenate and used for chitosan determination. FIG. 12 illustrates the chitosan levels present in lungs inoculated with each strain; cda1Δ chitosan levels were 50% that of KN99 wild type chitosan levels. Wild type cells (KN99) were grown in Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose (YPD) or Yeast Nitrogen Base (YNB) buffered to pH: 7.0 with 50 mM 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid (MOPS). Equal number of cells were subjected to chitosan measurements. FIG. 13 illustrates that the level of chitosan in KN99 cells grown in YNB pH 7.0 medium is less than 50% that of the level of KN99 cells grown in YPD medium, a similar reduction to that between wild type cells and cda1Δ cells isolated from mouse lungs.
