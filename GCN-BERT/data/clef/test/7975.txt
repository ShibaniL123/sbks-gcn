Preparation Example 5 (Compound Nos.: 8, 9 and 10)
Compound 11 (30 mg, 0.061 mmol) obtained from example 5 was dissolved in glacial acetic acid (1.5 ml) and water (5.9 Âµl). Silver acetate (21 mg, 0.121 mmol) and iodine (17 mg, 0.665 mmol) were added,and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The next day, the resultant was added with water, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with brine, concentrated by rotary evaporation, isolated by column chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol (v/v) = 25/1) to give compound 9-1, which contained a pair of diastereomers, 16 mg in total (yield 46.3%).
