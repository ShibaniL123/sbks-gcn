TITLE PROCESS FOR PREPARING FLUORINATED POLYMERIC HOLLOW NANOSPHERES BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE Field of the Disclosure The present disclosure relates to a process for making fluorinated polymeric nanospheres, more particularly to a preparation process for making fluorinated polymeric nanospheres utilizing a mini-emulsion preparation process and their use in coating compositions. Description of the Related Art Nanospheres are submicroscopic colloidal systems composed of a solid or liquid core surrounded by a thin polymer or inorganic shell. This solid or liquid core is removed to form hollow nanospheres. Such core- shell systems may be prepared from micro or miniemulsions via polymerization reaction at the interface of the droplets, the so-called interfacial polymerization reaction. Interfacial polymerization occurs at the interface of two immiscible phases, for example, oil and water, and a thin shell is formed. In the formation of the shell, the monomers are in either oil or water phase to participate in the reaction. Typically, for the preparation of core-shell nanocapsules via interfacial polymerization, a microemulsion or miniemulsion is first prepared, either water in oil or oil in water, wherein in the former nanocapsules with an aqueous core suspended in oil are formed and in the latter nanocapsules with an oily core suspended in water are formed. Existing processes for the preparation of fluorinated polymeric hollow particles either require a two- step polymerization process, or produce particles that are too large (> 1 pm). A need exists for a fluorinated polymeric hollow nanosphere via an interfacial miniemulsion polymerization reaction. It is also needed that the process can be prepared through a one step process and provide superior performance for opacity enhancement and easy-clean property in architectural and industrial coatings.

Some suitable initiators include azo compounds such as 2,2'- azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) or 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamide) dihydrochloride (AIBA); metal persulfate such as potassium persulfate (KPS) or sodium persulfate; more typically AIBN or KPS.

The initiator may be considered to be in either the water phase or oil phase. It is important because the combination of monomers to non-reactive solvent ratio, oil to water or water to oil ratio and surfactant level determine the particle size, hollow or non-hollow particle structure, and the shell thickness. The mixture in step (a) may be prepared in any glass container or stainless steel reaction vessel. The mixture of the above components is then sheared at an energy density of at least about 10Λ6 J/mA3, more typically about 10Λ7 J/mA3 to about 5*10Λ8 J/mA3, to form a mini-emulsion. Some useful means for shearing include an ultrasonic disruptor, high speed blender, high pressure homogenizer, high shear disperser, membrane homogenizer or colloid mill, more typically an ultrasonic disruptor, high speed blender, or a high pressure homogenizer. Typically shearing occurs for a period of about 5 to about 120 minutes depending on amount of emulsion needed to be prepared and desired emulsion size range, more typically about 30 minutes to about 60 minutes. Typically, shearing is accomplished at room temperature. Optionally, a defoamer may be needed to avoid foaming during emulsifying. Some suitable defoamers include BASF Foamaster®, Dow Corning® 71 and 74 Antifoams. The mini-emulsion formed in step (b) is then heated to at least about 50°C, more typically about 50°C to about 90°C; and still more typically about 60°C to about 80°C to form, in one step, a fluorinated polymeric hollow nanosphere. Heating may be accomplished using hot plate, heating mantle or any other heating method. Applications: These fluorinated polymeric hollow nanospheres are useful as hiding or opacifying agents in coating and molding compositions. They also provide water and oil repellency, easy to clean and or dirt-pickup resistance properties in coating and molding compositions. They are also useful as drug delivery systems in the pharmaceutical and medical industries; in food, personal care and cosmetics; and agriculture.
