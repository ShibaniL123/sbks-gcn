Technical Field The present invention relates to a molecular probe for imaging of pancreatic islets and a precursor thereof, and the use of the molecular probe and the precursor. Background Art Today, type-II diabetics are continuously increasing in Japan, and the estimated number of the same exceeds 8,200,000. As a measure against this increase, interventions for preventing diabetes from developing have been made based on the glucose tolerance test, resulting, however, in unsatisfactory effects. The cause is as follows: at such a borderline stage that functional abnormalities are found by the glucose tolerance test, disorders of pancreatic islets have already advanced to a high degree, and this stage possibly is too late as a time for starting interventions. More specifically, in the diabetes developing process, the amount of pancreatic islets (particularly, the amount of pancreatic β-cells) decreases prior to the occurrence of glucose tolerance abnormalities. Therefore, when functional abnormalities are detected or there are subjective symptoms, diabetes has already reached the stage where it is too difficult to be treated. On the other hand, if a decrease in the amount of pancreatic islets and/or the amount of pancreatic β-cells can be detected at an early stage, there is a possibility for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Therefore, a noninvasive imaging technique of pancreatic islets, particularly a noninvasive imaging technique of pancreatic islets for determining the amount of the pancreatic islets and/or the amount of pancreatic β-cells, has been desired for the prevention and diagnosis of diabetes. Among these, a molecular probe that enables pancreatic islets imaging, preferably pancreatic β-cell imaging or measurement of the amount of pancreatic β-cells, has been desired in particular. In designing a molecular probe for imaging of pancreatic islets, various target molecules in pancreatic cells, particularly functional proteins specific in the β-cells, are being researched. Among these, GLP-1R (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor) is being researched as a target molecule; GLP-1R is distributed in pancreatic β-cells, and is a seven-transmembrane G protein coupled receptor. As a molecular probe for imaging pancreatic islet β-cells, for example, a derivative of exendin-4(9-39) as a GLP-1R antagonist has been researched (e.g., Non-Patent Document 1). As an alternative probe for GLP-1R imaging, for the purpose of imaging a GLP-1R positive tumor, a derivative of exendin-4 as a GLP-1R agonist or a derivative of exendin-4(9-39) as a GLP-1R antagonist has been researched (e.g., Non-Patent Document 2). Non-Patent Documents 3 and 4 disclose the use of Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]exendin-4 as a ligand for GLP-1R targeting. However, a novel molecular probe for imaging of pancreatic islets that enables noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of pancreatic islets is ultimately preferred.

Description of the Invention The diameter of a pancreatic islet is, for example, approximately 50 to 500 µm in the case of humans. In order to noninvasively image or quantitate such pancreatic islets in a living body, a molecular probe, for example, is considered to be necessary that can show specific accumulation in pancreatic islets, thereby making contrast between pancreatic islets and surrounding organs. Research and development of molecular probes has therefore been conducted. For example, Non-Patent Document 2 reports the research on the affinity of Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)Exendin-4(9-39), which is a derivative of exendin-4(9-39), with respect to GLP-1R in GLP-1R-positive tumor cells and pancreatic islet cells. According to this document, the following was proved consequently: the uptake of Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)Exendin-4(9-39) in pancreatic islets was about 0.4%, the uptake thereof in the GLP-1R-positive tumor cells was about 7.5%. In other words, the results show that Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)Exendin-4(9-39) has a low affinity with respect to GLP-1R. Therefore, for example, under the present circumstances, a novel molecular probe that can show specific uptake in the pancreatic islets and produce a contrast with the surrounding organs is desired. The present invention is based on a finding that a molecular probe obtained by labeling and deprotecting the precursor for molecular probe for imaging and also the molecular probe for imaging enable for example noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of pancreatic islets by means of PET, SPECT or the like, and ensure quantitativeness. In other words, the present invention preferably achieves an effect of enabling noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of pancreatic islets. Further, since the present invention provides a molecular probe that enables more specific accumulation in the pancreatic islets in comparison with the molecular probes as described in the Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2, the present invention preferably achieves an effect of enabling imaging of pancreatic islets for quantitation. As described above, it is known that in the diabetes developing process, the amount of pancreatic islets decreases prior to the occurrence of glucose tolerance abnormalities. Therefore, by performing imaging of pancreatic islets and/or determining the amount of pancreatic islets, for example, minute changes in pancreatic islets can be found in a state prior to the development of diabetes or in an initial stage of the same, whereby the ultra-early detection and diagnosis of diabetes are enabled. Thus, the molecular probe precursor for imaging of the present invention is useful for the prevention, early detection, and diagnosis of diabetes, preferably for the ultra-early detection and diagnosis of diabetes.

[Imaging of Pancreatic Islet] In the present specification, the "imaging of pancreatic islet" refers to molecular imaging of pancreatic islets, and includes the imaging of in vivo spatial and/or time distribution of pancreatic islets. Further, in the present invention, the imaging of pancreatic islets preferably images pancreatic β-cells as target molecules, and more preferably images the GLP-1 receptor of the pancreatic β-cell as target molecules, from the viewpoint of the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of diabetes. Still further, in the present invention, the imaging of pancreatic islets preferably is noninvasive three-dimensional imaging, from the viewpoint of quantitativeness of an amount of pancreatic islets and applicability to humans. The method of imaging is not limited particularly, if it is a method that enables noninvasive imaging of pancreatic islet. Various methods are usable such as a method that utilizes positron emission tomography (PET), a method that utilizes single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), a method that utilizes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and methods that utilize X-rays, visible light, fluorescence, near infrared light, ultrasonic waves and the like. Among these, PET and SPECT are preferred, from the viewpoint of the quantitation of an amount of pancreatic islets with use of the molecular probe precursor of the present invention. [Molecular Probe Precursor of the Present Invention] A molecular probe precursor for use according to the present invention is a molecular probe precursor for imaging of pancreatic islets, the precursor containing any one of the following polypeptides: a polypeptide represented by any one of the formulae (1) to (4), the polypeptide being capable of binding to pancreatic islets after being labeled and deprotected, wherein the molecular probe is for use in imaging of pancreatic islet. Preferably, a molecular probe precursor for use according to the present invention is a molecular probe precursor for imaging of pancreatic islets, the precursor consisting of any one of the following polypeptides: a polypeptide represented by any one of the formulae (1) to (4), the polypeptide being capable of binding to pancreatic islets after being labeled and deprotected, wherein the molecular probe is for use in imaging of pancreatic islet. The molecular probe precursor for use according to the present invention is a polypeptide for use in imaging of pancreatic islets, and a polypeptide is represented by any one of the above-mentioned formulae (1) to (4). Amino acid sequences of polypeptides of the foregoing formulae (1) to (4) are the amino acid sequences according to SEQ ID NOS. 1 to 4 shown in the Sequence Listing, respectively. It should be noted that protecting groups for protecting amino groups are bonded to the following amino groups: amino groups of side chains of the lysines at positions 4 and 19 of the polypeptide of the foregoing formula (1), amino groups of side chains of the lysines at positions 3 and 18 of the polypeptide of the foregoing formula (2), amino groups of side chains of the lysines at positions 2 and 17 of the polypeptide of the foregoing formula (3), and amino groups of side chains of the lysines at positions 1 and 16 of the polypeptide of the foregoing formula (4). Further, the α-amino group at the N-terminus of each of the polypeptides of the foregoing formulae (1) to (4) is bonded to a protecting group for protecting the amino group, or the α-amino group is modified with a modifying group having no electric charge. The carboxyl group at the C-terminus of each of the polypeptides of the foregoing formulae (1) to (4) is amidated by an amino group, from a viewpoint of improving the property of binding to the pancreatic β-cells. When the molecular probe precursors for use according to the present invention that contain the polypeptides of the foregoing formulae (1) to (4) are labeled with a labeling system for labeling an amino group that will be described later, an amino group of the side chain of the lysine at the C-terminus not protected by a protecting group can be labeled.

It is known that exendin(9-39) bonds to GLP-1R (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor) expressed on the pancreatic β-cell. The molecular probe obtained by labeling and deprotecting the molecular probe precursor for use according to the present invention (this molecular probe is hereinafter referred to also as "molecular probe of the present invention") also is capable of binding to pancreatic islets, and preferably the pancreatic β-cells. In the present specification, the description of "being capable of binding to pancreatic islets" herein means the following: from the viewpoint of applying the present invention to the quantitation of the pancreatic islets and a use of the examination and diagnosis, the molecular probe as described herein preferably is capable of binding to the pancreatic β-cells, more preferably is at least specific to the pancreatic β-cells in the pancreas, and further more preferably is at least specific to such an extent that a signal thereof does not overlap a signal of another organ/tissue during a signal detection in noninvasive imaging with respect to humans. It should be noted that the molecular probe precursor as described herein can be produced by peptide synthesis in accordance with a typical method such as an Fmoc method, and the peptide synthesis method is not limited particularly.

Further, the molecular probe precursor for use according to the present invention preferably is used in imaging of pancreatic islets for the prevention and treatment for diabetes or for the diagnosis of diabetes. Such imaging of pancreatic islets may be performed by PET or SPECT, for example. [Protecting Group] The protecting group for the molecular probe precursor for use according to the present invention is intended to protect the other amino group than a specific amino group of the molecular probe as described herein while the specific amino group is being labeled, in which the specific amino group is the amino group of the side chain of the lysine positioned on the C-terminus side in the molecular probe precursor for use according to the present invention. As the protecting group, any known protecting group capable of performing such a function can be used.

[Modifying group] In the molecular probe precursor for use according to the present invention, the α-amino group at the N-terminus may be modified with a modifying group having no electric charge, from the viewpoint of canceling a positive charge of the α-amino group at the N-terminus thereby suppressing accumulation in kidneys of a molecular probe obtained by labeling or deprotecting the molecular probe precursor for use according to the present invention. For such modifying groups having no electric charge, groups described above as protective groups can be used, for example.

Thus, in a further embodiment the invention provides a method for determining the amount of pancreatic islets, comprising: (A) preparing a molecular probe for imaging of pancreatic islets by labeling and deprotecting the precursor of the molecular probe as described herein, wherein the labeling of the precursor comprises labeling the amino group of the side chain of the lysine at the C-terminus with a labeling compound comprising an aromatic ring having a radioactive nuclide; and calculating the amount of pancreatic islets based on the results of imaging of pancreatic islets with use of the molecular probe, or(B) detecting a signal of the molecular probe as described herein for imaging of pancreatic islets from an analyte to which the probe has been administered; and calculating the amount of pancreatic islets based on the detected signal of the molecular probe for imaging of pancreatic islets. The method for determining an amount of pancreatic islets as described herein may include presenting the calculated amount of pancreatic islets.

[Method of Prevention, Treatment, or Diagnosis of Diabetes] Further disclosed herein is a method for prevention, treatment, or diagnosis of diabetes. Specifically, the method of prevention, treatment, or diagnosis of diabetes as described herein includes preparing a molecular probe for imaging of pancreatic islets by labeling and deprotecting a molecular probe precursor for imaging as described herein, performing an imaging of pancreatic islets by using the molecular probe for imaging of pancreatic islets, and diagnosing diabetes by determining a state of pancreatic islets on the basis of the obtained images of pancreatic islets and/or an amount of pancreatic islets, and the method may include prevention or treatment of diabetes on the basis of the diagnosis. As described above, in the diabetes developing process, the amount of pancreatic islets (particularly, the amount of pancreatic β-cells) decreases prior to the occurrence of glucose tolerance abnormalities, and therefore, when functional abnormalities are detected or there are subjective symptoms, diabetes has already reached the stage where it is too difficult to be treated. With the imaging method using the molecular probe precursor as described herein and/or the molecular probe as described herein, and/or the method for determining an amount of the pancreatic islets using the same, however, a decrease in the amount of the pancreatic islets and/or the amount of the pancreatic β-cells can be detected at an early stage, and further, new methods for prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of diabetes can be created. Examples of a subject on which prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of diabetes are carried out include humans and mammals other than humans. For example, the method for prevention of diabetes as described herein may include regularly determining the amount of pancreatic islets, and checking presence/absence of a tendency of a decrease in the amount of pancreatic islets. Further, the method for treatment of diabetes as described herein may include evaluating an effect of treatment such as medication and diet performed on a subject, focusing on a change in an amount of pancreatic islets. Further, the method of diagnosis of diabetes as described herein can include imaging of pancreatic islets or determining an amount of pancreatic islets, and comparing the results with a size or amount as a reference, or determining the stages of diabetes. Preferably the method may be used for ultra-early diagnosis of diabetes. The method of ultra-early diagnosis of diabetes as described herein may include, for example, imaging pancreatic islets or determining an amount of pancreatic islets in comprehensive or ordinary medical examination by the method as described herein, and determining a state of the pancreatic islets on the basis of the obtained image of the pancreatic islets or the determined amount of the pancreatic islets. Further, a method for treatment of diabetes as described herein may include imaging pancreatic islets and/or determining an amount of pancreatic islets by the method as described herein, and evaluating functional recovery of the pancreatic islets on the basis of the obtained image of the pancreatic islets and/or the determined amount of the pancreatic islets.

Hereinafter, the present invention will be described further by way of Examples and Reference Examples. It should be noted that the present invention is, when interpreted, not limited to the following Examples. In the description of the present application, the following abbreviations are used. OBu: butyl ester groupBoc: butoxycarbonyl groupTrt: trityl groupPdf: 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl groupMmt: 4-methoxytrityl groupFmoc: 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl group Examples (Example 1) Using the molecular probe precursor of the above-described formula (1), which has a configuration in which protecting groups were bonded to an α-amino group at the N-terminus and the lysine residues at positions 4 and 19 of SEQ ID NO. 1 in the Sequence Listing, and in which the carboxyl group at the C-terminus is amidated, biodistribution of the same in a mouse was determined. First, a molecular probe for use according to the present invention was prepared in the following manner. [Preparation of Molecular Probe Precursor] Polypeptide synthesis was performed by using an automatic peptide synthesizer (Model 433A) manufactured by Applied Biosystems, in accordance with the attached software. For the amino acids having functional groups at the side chains, Asp(OBu), Ser(OBu), Lys(Boc), Gln(Trt), Glu(OBu), Arg(Pbf), Asn(Trt) and Trp(Boc) were used respectively. For the lysines at positions 4 and 19, Lys(Mmt) were used. Rink Amide MBHA (0.125 mmol, 0.34 mmol/g) was employed as the starting resin, the amino acids were extended serially according to the sequence, thereby the polypeptide having the sequence of the following formula (9) was obtained. In the following formula (9), the protecting groups of the side chains other than Lys(Mmt) were not recited. Fmoc-DLSK(Mmt)QMEEEAVRLFIEWLK(Mmt)NGGPSSGAPPPSK- resin (9) (SEQ ID NO. 9) By a typical process using 1.5% TFA - 5% TIS - 93.55% CH2Cl2, the protecting groups (Mmt groups) of the side chains at the lysine residues at positions 4 and 19 were removed from the polypeptide of the above formula (9), and the amino groups of the side chains at the free lysine residues at positions 4 and 19 were Fmoc-bonded. Subsequently, removal of all of the protecting groups other than the Fmoc groups of the lysine residues at positions 4 and 19 and excision of peptide from the resin were carried out by a typical process using 92.5% TFA - 2.5% TIS - 2.5% H2O - 2.5% ethanediol. After completion of the reaction, the carrier resin was removed by filtration, and dry ether was added thereto for precipitating the crude product, which was then filtered. The thus obtained crude product was purified in a linear gradient system of CH3CN-H2O containing 0.1% TFA, using a liquid chromatograph LC8A manufactured by Shimadzu Corp. (ODS column 3 cm × 25 cm). Then, intended fractions were collected by using a fraction collector, and thus the molecular probe precursor of the following formula (10) was obtained as a lyophilized white powder. Fmoc-DLSK(Fmoc)QMEEEAVRLFIEWLK(Fmoc)NGGPSSGAPPPSK-NH2(10) (SEQ ID NO. 10) [Preparation of Molecular Probe] The thus obtained molecular probe precursor (640 µg) of the above-described formula (10) was dissolved in borate buffer (pH 7.8). [18F]SFB was added thereto so that pH of the reaction solution was adjusted to 8.5 to 9.0. Thus, the precursor was labeled. Thereafter, DMF and piperidine were added thereto so as to cause a deprotecting reaction, whereby the intended product (molecular probe in which the lysine residue at position 32 of SEQ ID NO. 5 was labeled) was obtained. In other words, the obtained molecular probe is a molecular probe of the following formula (11) (SEQ ID NO. 11) in which, in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 5, [18F]FB (fluorobenzoyl group) is bound to the amino group of the side chain of the lysine at position 32, the carboxyl group at the C-terminus therein is amidated, and the α-amino group at the N-terminus is unmodified (amino group). [Biodistribution] The molecular probe thus prepared (5.6 µCi) of the above formula (11) was administered to unanesthetized 6-week-old ddY mice (male, weight: 30g) by intravenous injection (through the tail vein). When 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and 120 minutes had passed since the administration, organs were dissected out of the mice, respectively (n=5). The weight and the radioactivity of each organ were determined, and an accumulation amount (%dose/g) of the molecular probe was calculated from the radioactivity per unit weight. Exemplary results are shown in the following Table 1, FIGS. 1A and 1B. FIG. 1A is a graph showing how the accumulation of the molecular probe in each organ varied with time, and FIG. 1B is a graph zooming in on FIG. 1A.

As shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, the accumulation of the molecular probe prepared in Example 1 (the molecular probe of the above formula (11)) into the pancreas was 9.3 %dose/g at a point of 5 minutes after the administration, 6.9 %dose/g at a point of 15 minutes after the administration, and 9.7 %dose/g at a point of 30 minutes after the administration. During any of the time periods, the molecular probe prepared in Example 1 accumulated more in the pancreas than in the stomach, the intestines, the liver and the spleen as the organs adjacent to the pancreas. Particularly, during the time period from 5 minutes to 60 minutes after the administration, the accumulation amounts in the stomach and the intestines were as small as about 2 %dose/g, and during the time period from 5 minutes to 30 minutes after the administration, the accumulation amount in the pancreas during the same time period was approximately four times or more than the accumulation amounts in the stomach and the intestines. At or after 15 minutes since the administration, the accumulation amount in the liver was suppressed to 4 %dose/g or less. At or after 30 minutes since the administration, the accumulation amount in the pancreas was 2.5 times or more than the accumulation amount in the liver. This indicates that the molecular probe prepared in Example 1 accumulated specifically in the pancreas. Further, it was indicated that the radioactive accumulation in the bones was low and that it was not subjected to defluoridation metabolism in vivo. Therefore, the molecular probe of Example 1 (the molecular probe of the above formula (11)) is considered as suitable for the pancreatic β-cell imaging. (Reference Example 1) For Reference Example 1, a molecular probe was prepared from a molecular probe precursor of the following formula (12), which has a configuration in which protecting groups (Fmoc) were bonded to the α-amino group at the N-terminus and the lysine residue at position 19 of SEQ ID NO. 12 in the Sequence Listing and in which the carboxyl group at the C-terminus was amidated, and biodistribution of the same in a mouse was determined by using the molecular probe. In other words, biodistribution of a molecular probe (SEQ ID NO. 13) represented by the following formula (13) in a mouse was determined by using the same molecular probe in which [18F]FB (fluorobenzoyl group) was bonded to the amino group of the side chain of the lysine at position 4 and the carboxyl group at the C-terminus was amidated in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 12. Preparation of the molecular probe precursor and the molecular probe and also determination of the biodistribution were carried out in the same manner as Example 1.

(Reference Example 2) For Reference Example 2, a molecular probe was prepared from a molecular probe precursor of the following formula (14), which has a configuration in which protecting groups (Fmoc) were bonded to the N-terminus and the lysine residue at position 4 of SEQ ID NO. 14 in the Sequence Listing and in which the carboxyl group at the C-terminus was amidated, and biodistribution of the same in a mouse was determined by using the molecular probe. In other words, biodistribution of a molecular probe (SEQ ID NO. 15) represented by the following formula (15) in a mouse was determined by using the same molecular probe in which [18F]FB (fluorobenzoyl group) was bonded to the amino group of the side chain of the lysine at position 19 and the carboxyl group at the C-terminus was amidated in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 14. Preparation of the molecular probe precursor and the molecular probe and also determination of the biodistribution were carried out in the same manner as Example 1.

As shown in FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B, the molecular probe prepared in Example 1 (the molecular probe of the above formula (11)) accumulated more in the pancreas and less in the stomach and intestines as the organs adjacent to the pancreas, in comparison with the molecular probe of Reference Example 1 prepared by using the molecular probe precursor of the above formula (12) or the molecular probe of Reference Example 2 prepared by using the molecular probe precursor of the above formula (14). Further, the molecular probe prepared in Example 1 accumulated less in the liver and the kidneys in comparison with the molecular probe of Reference Example 1 and the molecular probe of Reference Example 2. The accumulation amount of the molecular probe prepared in Example 1 in the kidneys was the half or less the accumulation amount in the kidneys of the molecular probe of any of Reference Examples 1 and 2. This indicates that the molecular probe prepared in Example 1 accumulated specifically in the pancreas. Based on the accumulation amount obtained by the biodistribution experiments on the molecular probe in Example 1, the molecular probe in Reference Example 1 and the molecular probe in Reference Example 2, the ratio of pancreas/liver ('accumulation amount in pancreas' / 'accumulation amount in liver') for each probe is shown in Table 4 below, and the ratio of pancreas/kidney ('accumulation amount in pancreas' / 'accumulation amount in kidney') for each probe is shown in Table 5 below.

It was suggested that clear images of pancreas can be obtained at the time of imaging with the molecular probe of Example 1 where the ratio of accumulation amount in the pancreas to the surrounding organs of the pancreas is high and the accumulation amount in the surrounding organs of the pancreas is low. By administering the molecular probe of the above Reference Example 1 to a mouse, a three-dimensional image of the pancreas of the mouse is obtained. Further, by administering the molecular probe of the above Reference Example 2 to a mouse, a noninvasive three-dimensional image of the pancreas of the mouse is obtained. As mentioned above, the molecular probe prepared in Example 1 by labeling the side chain of the lysine at the C-terminus accumulated more in the pancreas and accumulated less in the stomach and the intestines as the organs adjacent to the pancreas, in comparison with the molecular probe of Reference Example 1 prepared by using the molecular probe precursor of the formula (12) and the molecular probe of Reference Example 2 prepared by using the molecular probe precursor of the formula (14). This indicates that the molecular probe prepared in Example 1 enables a noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of pancreatic islets. These results indicate that a molecular probe precursor for use according to the present invention enables a noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of pancreas in humans, particularly noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of pancreatic β-cells. [Blocking experiment] Ablocking experiment was performed by using a molecular probe prepared in Example 1 (the molecular probe of the formula (11)). For the mice, 6-week-old ddY mice (male, weight: about 30g) were used. First, non-labeled exendin(9-39) (cold probe) was administered (0.1 mL of 0.5 mg/mL solution) preliminarily by intravenous injection to unanesthetized mice. At a point of 30 minutes after the foregoing preliminary administration, the prepared molecular probe of the formula (11) (5 µCi) was administered by intravenous injection. Then, at a time of 30 minutes after the administration of the molecular probe, the organs were dissected out, respectively (n=5). The weight and the radioactivity of each organ were determined, and an accumulation amount (%dose/g) was calculated from the radioactivity per unit weight. Exemplary results are shown in FIG. 4. As a control, without preliminary administration of a cold probe, the prepared molecular probe (5 µCi) of the formula (11) was administered to unanesthetized mice by intravenous injection. Then, at a time of 30 minutes after the administration, the respective organs were dissected (n = 5). The weight and the radioactivity of each organ were determined, and an accumulation amount (%dose/g) of the probe was calculated from the radioactivity per unit weight. Exemplary results are shown in FIG. 4, together with the exemplary results for the case including the preliminary administration. FIG. 4 is a graph showing an accumulation amount (%dose/g) for the case including the preliminary administration and an accumulation amount (%dose/g) for the control (without preliminary administration). As shown in FIG. 4, it was observed that, the binding with a receptor was inhibited by preliminary administration of a cold probe, whereby about 75% of the uptake of the molecular probe of the formula (11) was inhibited. [Two-Dimensional Imaging Analysis] Two-dimensional imaging analysis was performed using transgenic mice that have a genetic background of ICR mice and express GFP (green fluorescent protein) under regulation of MIP (mouse insulin I gene promoter) (hereinafter these mice are referred to as "MIP-GFP mice"). For a molecular probe, the molecular probe of the formula (11) prepared in Example 1 was used. The molecular probe thus prepared of the formula (11) was administered to unanesthetized MIP-GFP mice (male, weight: 20g) by intravenous injection (200 µL of about 171 µCi), and at a point of 30 minutes after the administration, the pancreases were dissected out of the mice (n=2). Sections were cut out of the dissected pancreases, and each section was placed on a slide glass, covered with a cover glass. Fluorescence and radioactivity (autoradiography) of each section were determined using an image analyzer (trade name: Typhoon 9410, produced by GE Health Care Inc.) (exposure time: 15 hours). Exemplary results of the same are shown in FIG. 5. FIG. 5 shows exemplary results of the imaging analysis of the pancreas sections of the MIP-GFP mice at a point of 30 minutes after the administration of the molecular probe of the formula (11), where (a) indicates a fluorescence signal and (b) indicates a radioactivity signal. As shown in (a) and (b) of FIG. 5, a fluorescence GFP signal and a radioactivity signal were detected respectively by an image analyzer in each of the pancreas sections of the MIP-GFP mice. Further, as shown in (a) and (b) of FIG. 5, the localization of the radioactivity signal detected from the labeled molecular probe of the formula (11) was consistent with that of the GFP signal. From this, it was confirmed that the molecular probe of the formula (11) accumulated specifically in the pancreatic β-cells. [Three-Dimensional Imaging] The prepared molecular probe of the formula (11) (89 µCi) was administered to anesthetized 6-week-old ddY mice (male, weight: 30g) by intravenous injection, and a three-dimensional imaging was carried out with the following PET device and under the following condition. Imaging device: eXplore Vista (trade name, produced by GE Inc.)Scan Mode: Static ScanReconstruction: 2DOSEM (Dynamic OS-EM) Exemplary results are shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B. The image was taken at a point of 30 minutes after the administration of the molecular probe (integrating time: 20 minutes). FIG. 6A shows a coronal view, and FIG. 6B shows a transverse view of the three-dimensional imaging. The white circles in FIGS. 6A and 6B indicate the positions of the pancreas. It should be noted that the images of FIGS. 6A and 6B are at the same contrast. As shown in FIG. 6, the position of the pancreas was confirmed clearly and noninvasively with use of the molecular probe of the formula (11). In other words, it was confirmed that the molecular probe disclosed herein enables the noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of the pancreatic islet. (Example 2) In the molecular probe precursor of the above-described formula (1), which has a configuration in which protecting groups were bonded to the lysine residues at positions 4 and 19 of SEQ ID NO. 1 in the Sequence Listing, and in which the carboxyl group at the C-terminus is amidated, using the molecular probe precursor of the above-described formula (16) in which the α-amino group at the N-terminus is acetylated, biodistribution of the same in a mouse was determined. First, the molecular probe was prepared in the following manner. For the protecting group of the lysine residue, Fmoc was used. Ac-DLSK(Fmoc)QMEEEAVRLFIEWLK(Fmoc)NGGPSSGAPPPSK-NH2 (16) (SEQ ID NO. 16) [Preparation of Molecular Probe] The molecular probe precursor of the above formula (16) was prepared in the same manner as Example 1 except that the protecting group (Fmoc) of the α-amino group at the N-terminus was deprotected and acetylated. The obtained molecular probe precursor (540 µg) of the above formula (16) was dissolved in borate buffer (pH 7.8). [18F]SFB was added thereto so that pH of the reaction solution was adjusted to pH of 8.5 to 9.0. Thus, the precursor was labeled. Thereafter, DMF and piperidine were added thereto so as to cause a deprotecting reaction, whereby the intended product (molecular probe where the lysine residue at position 32 of SEQ ID NO. 5 is labeled) was obtained. In other words, the obtained molecular probe is a molecular probe of the following formula (17) (SEQ ID NO. 17) in which, in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 5, [18F]FB (fluorobenzoyl group) is bound to the amino group of the side chain of the lysine at position 32 in the amino acid sequence, the α-amino group at the N-terminus is acetylated, and the carboxyl group at the C-terminus is amidated. In the following formula (17), Ac indicates that the α-amino group at the N-terminus is acetylated. [Biodistribution] The probe of the above formula (17) thus prepared (7 µCi) was administered to unanesthetized 6-week-old ddY mice (male, weight: 30g) by intravenous injection (through the tail vein). When 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and 120 minutes had passed since the administration, organs were dissected out of the mice, respectively (n=5). The weight and the radioactivity of each organ were determined, and an accumulation amount (%dose/g) of the probe was calculated from the radioactivity per unit weight. Exemplary results are shown in the following Table 6, FIGS. 7A and 7B. FIG. 7A is a graph showing how the accumulation of the molecular probe in each organ varied with time, and FIG. 7B is a graph zooming in on FIG. 7A.

As shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, the accumulation of the molecular probe of the above formula (17) prepared in Example 2 into the pancreas was 7.0 %dose/g at a point of 5 minutes after the administration, 6.5 %dose/g at a point of 15 minutes after the administration, and 7.3 %dose/g at a point of 30 minutes after the administration. During any of the time periods, the molecular probe of the above formula (17) prepared in Example 2 accumulated more in the pancreas than in the stomach and the intestines as the organs adjacent to the pancreas. Particularly, during any of the time periods, the accumulation amounts in the stomach were as small as about 2 %dose/g, the accumulation amounts in the intestines were as small as about 1.7 %dose/g, and the accumulation amount in the pancreas was three times or more than the accumulation amounts in the stomach and intestines during this time period. At or after 15 minutes since the administration, the accumulation in the liver was suppressed to not more than 4 %dose/g. At or after 30 minutes since the administration, the accumulation amount in the pancreas was twice or more than the accumulation amount in the liver. This indicates that the molecular probe of the above formula (17) prepared in Example 2 accumulated specifically in the pancreas. Further, it was suggested that the radioactive accumulation in the bones was small and that it was not subjected to defluoridation metabolism in vivo. Therefore, the molecular probe of the above formula (17) is considered as suitable for the pancreatic β-cell imaging. Furthermore, as shown in FIGS. 1A, 1B and FIGS. 7A and 7B, accumulation in kidneys of the molecular probe of Example 2 (the molecular probe of the above formula (17)) in which the α-amino group at the N-terminus was acetylated was suppressed in comparison with the case of molecular probe of Example 1 (the molecular probe of the above formula (11)) in which the α-amino group at the N-terminus was not acetylated. Based on the accumulation amount obtained by the biodistribution experiments on the molecular probe in Example 2, the ratio of pancreas/liver ('accumulation amount in pancreas' / 'accumulation amount in liver') is shown in Table 4 above, and the ratio of pancreas/kidney ('accumulation amount in pancreas' / 'accumulation amount in kidney') is shown in Table 5 above. As shown in the above Tables 4 and 5, the ratio of pancreas/liver and the ratio of pancreas/kidney of the molecular probe of Example 2 were higher in comparison with the molecular probe of Reference Example 1 and the molecular probe of Reference Example 2. It was suggested that clear images of pancreas can be obtained at the time of imaging with the molecular probe of Example 2 where the ratio of accumulation amount in the pancreas to the surrounding organs is high and the accumulation amounts in the surrounding organs of the pancreas are low. As shown in FIGS. 2A, 2B, FIGS. 3A, 3B and FIGS. 4A and 4B, the molecular probe of the above formula (17) prepared according to Example 2 accumulated in the pancreas more while the accumulation amounts in the stomach and the intestines as organs adjacent to the pancreas were small in comparison with the cases of molecular probe of the above Reference Example 1 and the molecular probe of the above Reference Example 2. Further, the molecular probe of the above formula (17) prepared according to Example 2 accumulated in kidneys less in comparison with the case of molecular probes of the Reference Examples 1 and 2. The accumulation amount in kidneys of the molecular probe prepared according to Example 2 was the half or less than the accumulation amount in kidneys of the molecular probe of any of Reference Example 1 (the molecular probe of the above formula (13)) and Reference Example 2 (the molecular probe of the above formula (15)). This suggests that the molecular probe of the above formula (17) prepared according to Example 2 accumulated particularly in the pancreas. Therefore, it was suggested that the molecular probe of the above formula (17) prepared according to Example 2 enabled a noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of pancreatic islets. The foregoing results suggested that the molecular probe precursor for use according to the present invention enables noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of the pancreas, and particularly, noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of pancreatic β-cells, in humans. (Example 3) [Binding Assay] Labeling and deprotecting of the molecular probe precursor of the above formula (10) prepared in Example 1 were carried out in the same manner as Example 1 except that the [18F]SFB was replaced by [127I]N-succinimidyl 3-iodobenzoate ([127I]SIB), thereby obtaining a molecular probe (SEQ ID NO. 18) of the formula (18) below. Pancreatic islets isolated from a mouse was recovered in a 50 ml-tube and after centrifugation (2000 rpm, 2 minutes), it was washed once with 20 mL of cold PBS. To which, 15 mL of trypsin-EDTA (which was prepared by adding 12 mL of PBS-containing 0.53mM EDTA (pH: 7.4 (NaOH)) to 3 mL of trypsin-EDTA (0.05% / 0.53mM) was added, and incubating with shaking at 37°C for one minute, it was placed immediately on ice. Subsequently, after pipetting vigorously 20 times with a 10 mL pipette dropper without foaming, the cold PBS was added so that the final amount would be 30 mL. After centrifugation (3000 rpm, 2 minutes), it was washed twice with 30 mL of cold PBS. The supernatant was removed to obtain pancreatic islet cells sample. The obtained pancreatic islet cells sample was reserved at -80°C. The pancreatic islet cells sample was suspended in a buffer (20mM, HEPES (pH: 7.4), 1 mM MgCl2, 1mg/ml bacitracin, 1 mg/ml BSA) so as to make 100 µL/tube. Then, 880 µL of the buffer and 10 µL of a solution including the molecular probe of the above formula (18) (final concentration of molecular probe: 0,1×10-6 to 1x10-12 M), and 10 µL of a solution including [125I] labeled Exendin (9-39) (prepared by adding 90 µL of a buffer to 10 µL of [125I]Bolton-Hunter labeled Exendin (9-39) (product code: NEX335, 1.85 MBq/mL = 50 µCi/mL, 22.73 pmol/mL = 76.57 ng/mL, manufactured by Perkin Elmer) were added thereto, which was incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. Here, the final concentration of the [125I] labeled Exendin (9-39) was set to 0.05 µCi/tube. Next, after B/F separation by aspirating with use of an aspirator to which a moistened glass fiber filter (Whatman GF/C filter) was attached, the filter was washed three times with 5 ml of an ice-cooled PBS. The filter was set in the tube, and the radioactivity measurement was carried out with a gamma counter. The results are shown in FIG. 8. FIG. 8 is a graph showing exemplary results of analysis with a SigmaPlot11 (trade name). As shown in FIG. 8, the molecular probe of the above formula (18) inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the binding between the GLP-1R and the [125I] labeled Exendin (9-39). The IC50 of the molecular probe of the above formula (18) was 3.52 × 10-9 M, and thus the molecular probe of the above formula (18) exhibited a high affinity with respect to the GLP-1 receptor of pancreatic islets. Moreover, the IC50 of the molecular probe of the above formula (18) was approximate to that of Exendin (9-39) (IC50: 1.4 × 10-9M), and thus, with respect to the GLP-1 receptor of pancreatic islets, the molecular probe of the above formula (18) is considered to have an affinity comparable to that of Exendin (9-39) as an antagonist for GLP-1 receptor of pancreatic islets. Next, using a molecular probe (SEQ ID NO. 19) of the following formula (19), which has a configuration in which the amino group of the side chain of the lysine residue at position 32 is labeled with 3-[125I]iodobenzoyl group (hereinafter, referred to also as "[125I]IB label"), the carboxyl group at the C-terminus is amidated and the α-amino group at the N-terminus is not acetylated in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 5 in the Sequence Listing, determination of biodistribution of the same in a mouse and a two-dimensional analysis were carried out. The molecular probe of the following formula (19) was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except that [125I]N-succinimidyl 3-iodobenzoate (SIB) was used in place of [18F]SFB. [Biodistribution] The molecular probe thus prepared (1 µCi) of the formula (19) was administered to unanesthetized 6-week-old ddY mice (male, weight: about 30g) by intravenous injection (through the tail vein). When 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and 120 minutes had passed since the administration, organs were dissected out of the mice, respectively (n=5). The weight and the radioactivity of each organ were determined, and an accumulation amount (%dose/g) was calculated from the radioactivity per unit weight. Exemplary results are shown in the following Table 7, FIGS. 9A and 9B. FIG. 9A is a graph showing how the accumulation of the molecular probe in each organ varied with time, and FIG. 9B is a graph zooming in on FIG. 9A.

As shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B, the accumulation of the molecular probe of the formula (19) prepared in Example 3 into the pancreas was 7.7 %dose/g at a point of 5 minutes after the administration, 12.3 %dose/g at a point of 15 minutes after the administration, 8.7 %dose/g at a point of 30 minutes after the administration, and 10.9 %dose/g at a point of 60 minutes after the administration. During any of the time periods, the molecular probe of the formula (19) accumulated more in the pancreas than in the stomach and the intestines as the organs adjacent to the pancreas. Particularly, during the time period from 5 minutes to 30 minutes after the administration, the accumulation amounts in the stomach and intestines were as small as about 4 %dose/g, and the accumulation amount in the pancreas was three times or more than the accumulation amounts in the stomach and intestines during this time period. At or after 30 minutes since the administration, the accumulation amount of the molecular probe of the formula (19) in the liver was not more than 5 %dose/g. This indicates that the molecular probe of the formula (19) accumulated specifically in the pancreas. Further, no great change was seen in the accumulation in the neck, and this suggests that the molecular probe of the formula (19) was not subjected to deiodization metabolism in vivo. Therefore, the molecular probe of the formula (19) is considered suitable for the pancreatic β-cell imaging, particularly noninvasive pancreatic β-cell imaging. [Two-Dimensional Imaging Analysis] The molecular probe of the formula (19) (5 µCi) was administered to unanesthetized MIP-GFP mice (male, weight: 20g) by intravenous injection, and at points of 30 minutes and 60 minutes after the administration, the pancreases were dissected out of the mice, respectively (n=2). Sections were cut out of the dissected pancreases, and each section was placed on a slide glass, covered with a cover glass. Fluorescence and radioactivity (autoradiography) of each section were determined using an image analyzer (trade name: Typhoon 9410, produced by GE Health Care Inc.) (exposure time: 18 hours). Exemplary results of the same are shown in FIG. 10. As a control, a commercially-available Exendin (9-39) where the labeling group is not bound (cold probe) was administered preliminarily to unanesthetized MIP-GFP mice (male, weight: 20g) by intravenous injection (50 µg / 100 µL). At a point of 30 minutes after the foregoing preliminary administration, the prepared molecular probe of the formula (19) (5 µCi) was administered by intravenous injection. Then, at a time of 30 minutes after the administration of the molecular probe of the above formula (19), the pancreases were dissected out (n=2). Sections were cut out of the dissected pancreases, and fluorescence and radioactivity of each section were determined in the same manner as described above. One of exemplary results of the same is shown in FIG. 10 together with an exemplary result without the preliminary administration. FIG. 10 shows exemplary results of the imaging analysis of the pancreas sections of the MIP-GFP mice to which the molecular probe of the formula (19) was administered. The images shown therein are images showing a fluorescence signal (a) and a radioactivity signal (b) of each of the sections at the point of 30 minutes after the administration of the molecular probe of the formula (19). As shown in (a) and (b) of FIG. 10, a fluorescence GFP signal and a radioactivity signal were detected by an image analyzer in each of the pancreas sections of the MIP-GFP mice. Further, the localization of the radioactivity signal detected from the labeled molecular probe of the formula (19) was consistent with that of the GFP signal. From this, it was confirmed that the molecular probe of the formula (19) accumulated specifically in the pancreatic β-cells. As shown in FIG. 10(b), substantially no radioactivity signal was detected from the control section to which the cold probe had been administered preliminarily. From this, it was observed that, the binding with a GLP-1 receptor was inhibited by preliminary administration of a cold probe, whereby the uptake of the molecular probe of the formula (19) was inhibited. From this, it was confirmed that the molecular probe of the formula (19) was bound to the GLP-1 receptor of a pancreatic β-cell. Here, all of 125I, 123I, and 131I were γ-ray emitting nuclides. Still further, 125I and 123I have the same numbers of nuclear spins. In view of these, it can be presumed that even a molecular probe obtained by replacing the radioactive iodine atom (125I) used in the labeling of the molecular probe of the formula (19) with 123I or 131I will exhibit behaviors substantially identical to those of the molecular probe of the formula (19). Further, it also can be presumed that even a molecular probe obtained by the radioactive iodine atom (125I) with 124I will exhibit behaviors substantially identical to those of the molecular probe of the formula (19). Thus, it was suggested that using the molecular probe obtained by replacing 125I of the molecular probe of the formula (19) with 123I, 124I, or 131I, for example, the noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of pancreatic β-cells by SPECT, PET, or the like is enabled, and preferably, the quantification of pancreatic β-cells is enabled. (Example 4) A molecular probe (SEQ ID NO. 20) of the following formula (20) was prepared, which had a configuration in the amino acid sequence of SEC ID NO. 5, the amino group of the side chain of the lysine residue at position 32 was labeled with 3-[123I]iodobenzoyl group (hereinafter, referred to also as "[123I]IB label"), the carboxyl group at the C-terminus was amidated and the α-amino group at the N-terminus was not acetylated. The molecular probe of the following formula (20) was prepared in the same manner as in Example 3 except that [123I]SIB was used in place of [125I]SIB. [Three-dimensional imaging] Using the molecular probe of the above formula (20), SPECT imaging of mice was carried out. The molecular probe of the above formula (20) (243 µCi/120µL) was administered to anesthetized 6-week-old ddY mice (male, weight: about 30g) by intravenous injection, and a SPECT imaging was carried out. The SPECT imaging was carried out under the following imaging conditions for 32 minutes starting at the point of 30 minutes after the administration of the molecular probe, with use of a gamma camera (product name: SPECT2000H-40 manufactured by Hitachi Medical Corporation). Images obtained were reconfigured under the following reconfiguration conditions. Imaging condition Collimator: LEPH pinhole collimator Collection angle of detector: 360° at 11.25°/60sec Collection time: 60 sec × 32 frames, 32 minutes Reconfiguration condition Pretreatment filter: Buttenwor th filter (oder:10, cutoff frequency: 0.13) Exemplary results are shown in FIGS. 11A to 11C. The images were taken at 30 minutes after the administration of the molecular probe (accumulation integrating time: 32 minutes). FIG. 11A shows a transverse view, and FIG. 11B shows a coronal view, and FIG. 11C is sagittal view. The white circles in FIGS. 11B and 11C indicate the positions of the pancreas. It should be noted that the images of FIGS. 11A to 11C are at the same contrast. As shown in FIGS. 11A to 11C, the position of the pancreas was confirmed noninvasively in mice with use of the molecular probe of the above formula (20). In other words, it was confirmed that the molecular probe enables the noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of the pancreatic islet. Thus, in view of that the position of the pancreas was confirmed noninvasively in a mouse that has the pancreas in a smaller size than that of a human and in which the organs are present more densely than in a human, this suggests that in a human that has the pancreas in a greater size than that of a mouse and in which the organs are present not as densely as in a mouse, the position of the pancreas and the size of the pancreas can be determined more clearly, and moreover, an amount of expression of the probe in the pancreas can be determined. Therefore, it was suggested that the molecular probe for pancreatic islets imaging of the present invention should enable noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of the pancreas in a human, particularly noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of pancreatic β-cells.
