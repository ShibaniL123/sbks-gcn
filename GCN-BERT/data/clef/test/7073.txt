Latin name of the genus and species of the plant claimed: Citrus reticulata. Variety denomination: ‘C4-15-19’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct variety of mandarin tree named ‘C4-15-19’. ‘C4-15-19’ is a triploid hybrid from an interploid cross of diploid monoembryonic ‘Sugar Belle’®, patented as ‘LB8-9’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 21,356) tangelo (female parent) crossed with an allotetraploid somatic hybrid of ‘Nova’ mandarin hybrid (unpatented, Clementine×Orlando)+‘Succari’ sweet orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) (male parent, unpatented), obtained via embryo rescue. Two original trees exist in Lake Alfred, Fla., one of which is grafted to ‘Carrizo’ (unpatented) citrus rootstock, and the other of which is grafted to a somatic hybrid of sour orange+‘Flying Dragon’ (unpatented). ‘C4-15-19’ was first asexually reproduced in Lake Alfred, Fla. Trueness-to-type through asexual propagation was demonstrated by topworking (grafting) onto the somatic hybrid rootstock sour orange+‘Carrizo’, also located in Lake Alfred, Fla. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION ‘C4-15-19’ produces a ‘Clementine’-sized, seedless, peelable tangerine-type fruit with high sugar content and a very sweet flavor. Fruit matures between October and November in Lake Alfred, Fla. (USDA Zone 9), depending on environmental factors. Fruit pigments well under typical Florida weather conditions (without cold-induction), both internally and externally. Fruit of ‘C4-15-19’ should be clipped to avoid plugging, particularly with fruit harvested during the latter part of the harvest season. Initiation of peel removal is easy, and the top half of the fruit is generally much easier to peel than the bottom half. Peelability of ‘C4-15-19’ seems to improve during storage. The rind contains large oil glands, and pleasantly fragrant oil can be released during peeling, especially with recently harvested fruit. This characteristic is expected to diminish as the trees grow through juvenility. The original tree yielded approximately 1 to 1.5 boxes (90 lbs per box) of fruit in 2013 on a dwarf tree (5 feet in height). ‘C4-15-19’ has a unique fruit, and is not directly comparable to any commercial variety. ‘C4-15-19’ is also morphologically distinct from both parent varieties. The female parent, ‘Sugar Belle’® (‘LB8-9’), produces a larger, bell-shaped fruit that is much tangier, more difficult to peel, and is seedy. The pollen parent, ‘Nova’+‘Succari’, produces a similar-shaped but larger fruit, some seeds, and has a smoother rind, poor internal color, and less pleasant and acidic flavor. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS ‘C4-15-19’ is illustrated by the accompanying photographs, which show the tree's form, foliage and fruit. The color chart used for color designations was The R.H.S. Colour Chart by The Royal Horticultural Society in London, Second Edition, in association with the Flower Council of Holland. The colors shown are as true as can be reasonably obtained by conventional photographic procedures. The photographs are of a single tree approximately 6 years old. FIGS. 1, 2, and 3 were taken in the fall of 2012. FIGS. 4, 5, 6, and 7 were taken during the early winter from the same tree.

The original trees are growing in a block of trees heavily impacted by HLB (Huanglongbing or citrus greening). One of the original trees has been diagnosed with HLB, with symptoms being observed in the winter months (first observed in February, 2013); however, symptomatic branches died, and the remainder of the tree appears to be recovering. Under optimized nutrition, infected trees can maintain productivity of quality fruit. ‘C4-15-19’ exhibits better HLB tolerance than sweet orange, but less tolerance than female parent ‘Sugar Belle’® (‘LB8-9’). 1. A new and distinct cultivar of mandarin tree as illustrated and described herein.
