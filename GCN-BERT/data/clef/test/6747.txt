SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITORS OF FIBROSIS CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 61/832,768, filed June 7, 2013, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Fibrosis, generally defined as the production of excessive amounts of connective tissue, develops as a consequence of diverse underlying diseases. Chronic inflammation or tissue damage/remodeling are typical fibrosis inducing events. Specific disease examples include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), liver fibrosis associated with the later stages of alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver cirrhosis, kidney fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, and keloid formation resulting from abnormal wound healing [Wynn, Τ. A. (2004) Nature Reviews Immunology. 4: 583-594; Friedman, S.L. (2013) Science Translation Medicine. 5(167): 1-17]. Additionally, fibrosis is a key pathological feature associated with chronic autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and scleroderma. Diseases representing a dire unmet medical need include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), scleroderma and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) related liver fibrosis. The increased incidence of NASH related liver fibrosis is expected to directly parallel those of type 2 diabetes and obesity. [0003] Scleroderma is a rare chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the replacement of normal tissue with dense, thick fibrous tissue. While the exact underlying cause of scleroderma is unknown, the disease generally involves immune cell mediated activation of dermal myofibroblasts leading to the deposition of excessive amounts of extracellular matrix proteins (e.g., type I collagen) that causes a thickening of the skin and in some cases the hardening and eventual failure of multiple organs. At present, there is no cure for scleroderma. Treatment is limited to attempts to manage symptoms and typically requires a combination of approaches. While scleroderma localized to the skin is typically not life threatening, systemic scleroderma affecting multiple internal organs can be a life-threatening disease.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [00138] Fibrosis represents a critically important yet surprisingly neglected health problem. Nearly 45% of all natural deaths in the Western world are attributed to chronic fibroproliferative diseases. However, there is currently only one clinically approved drug (Pirfenidone) that specifically targets the pathogenesis of fibrosis and is directly indicated for the treatment of a fibrotic disease. Fibrosis affects nearly every tissue in the body and, when highly progressive, can lead to organ malfunction and death. Clearly, the identification of novel anti-fibrotic drugs represents an unmet medical need that would have significant beneficial impact on patients in multiple disease populations. In addition, at present there is no cure for scleroderma and treatment is limited to symptom management. [00139] Fibrosis, generally defined as the production of excessive amounts of connective tissue, develops as a consequence of diverse underlying diseases. Chronic inflammation or tissue damage/remodeling are typical fibrosis inducing events. Fibrosis affects nearly every tissue in the body and, when highly progressive, can lead to organ malfunction and death. Specific disease examples include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); liver fibrosis associated with the later stages of alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver cirrhosis; kidney fibrosis; cardiac fibrosis; and keloid formation resulting from abnormal wound healing. Additionally, fibrosis is a key pathological feature associated with chronic autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, Crohn's disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. As such, fibrosis represents a critically important yet surprisingly neglected health problem. Indeed, nearly 45% of all natural deaths in the Western world are attributed to chronic fibroproliferative diseases. However, at present, there is only one clinically approved drug (Pirfenidone, approved for the treatment of IPF in Europe only) that specifically targets the pathogenesis of fibrosis and is directly indicated for the treatment of a fibrotic disease. Unfortunately, Pirfenidone has significant liver and GI side effects, and patients treated with Pirfenidone are advised to avoid direct sunlight exposure, as it is known to cause photosensitivity reactions leading to rash, dry skin or pruritus. Recently, lysophosphatidic acid 1 (LPA1) antagonists (e.g., AM-152) have been demonstrated to be efficacious in preclinical models of IPF. However, clinical efficacy remains to be demonstrated for AM-152. Clearly, the identification of novel anti-fibrotic drugs represents a major unmet medical need that would have significant beneficial impact on patients in multiple disease populations. [00140] Despite the diversity of diseases and triggers that can initiate a fibrotic process in a given tissue or organ, common biochemical and cellular mechanisms occur in all instances studied to date. Following injury or inflammatory insult, resident fibroblasts (in some cases recruited bone marrow-derived circulating fibrocytes or epithelial cells that have undergone an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition) are activated and “transdifferentiate” into a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) expressing myofibroblasts that secrete the extracellular matrix (ECM) components required for wound repair. In the case of liver fibrosis, a resident pericyte population termed a quiescent hepatic stellate cell (HSC) “transdifferentiates” into a type I collagen producing a-SMA expressing fibrogenic “activated” HSC. Transforming growth factorβ1 (TGF-pi) mediated Smad 3/4 signaling commonly drives the transdifferentiation of resident fibroblasts or HSCs to myofibroblasts or activated HSCs and stimulates production of ECM components in the latter populations. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) also serves as a common pro-fibrotic cytokine that drives cell activation and proliferation. [00141] One therapeutic approach for the treatment of progressive fibrosis diseases is to target one of the multitudes of complex causative immunological processes. This approach is limited by a lack of mechanistic clarity and potential exacerbation of the underlying disease. An attractive alternative approach for the treatment of diverse fibrotic diseases is to directly target the transdifferentiation pathway responsible for interconversion of quiescent fibroblasts and activated pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts. Drugs capable of blocking the conversion of fibroblasts to activated myofibroblasts could be administered prophylactically following injury or insult (e.g., myocardial infaction) or therapeutically in the early stages of disease in organs capable of repair (e.g., liver fibrosis, IPF or scleroderma). Direct suppressors of TGF-pi production (e.g., Pirfenidone) are not ideal candidates for chronic dosing and are especially undesirable for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, as they have the potential to exacerbate autoimmune responses. Alternatively, drugs capable of inducing the reversion of existing myofibroblasts to a quiescent cell fate would have broad applicability for the treatment of fibrosis in multiple tissue types and could potentially be efficacious at later stages of disease. [00142] High content imaging assays have been established, using primary human lung fibroblasts and primary rodent HSCs, that enable the identification of small molecules that either inhibit myofibroblast formation/activation or induce the reversion of activated myofibroblasts to a quiescent fibroblast state. Conditions, involving serum starvation and subsequent TGF-P treatment, have been identified that facilitate robust in vitro transdifferentiation in a miniaturized (384 well plate) format that is amenable to high throughput small molecule screening. The inhibition assay is based on a-SMA immunofluorescent staining and cell morphology changes associated with fibroblast to myofibroblast transdifferentiation, Using the selective ALK-5 TGFβ1 receptor inhibitor (SB-43154) as a positive control, the inhibition assay has been used to initiate a screen of a collection of -100,000 small molecules that consists of bioactive small molecules and a diversity set that has been assembled based on 2D and 3D structural diversity and inherent “drug-likeness” properties. Preliminary screening led to the identification of multiple previously identified anti-fibrotic molecules. The majority of these have limited clinical utility, as a result of known off target toxicity issues or demonstrated lack of in vivo efficacy. However, in addition to these, the triazole antifungal agent Itraconazole was identified as a highly efficacious inhibitor of myofibroblast formation (at doses well below those associated with toxicity in fibroblasts or other control cell types). [00143] The activity of Itraconazole was confirmed in vitro by analyzing expression changes in multiple genes associated with fibroblast to myofibroblast transdifferentiation using biochemical methods (i.e., Western blot and RT-PCR). Using pharmacological methods, the mechanistic basis for the anti-fibrotic activity of this molecule has been established as dual inhibition of hedgehog signaling and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEFG) receptor glycosylation/trafficking (neither activity alone is sufficient). Encouragingly, it was established that the activity of Itraconazole translates to both human and rodent cell types, as well as to cells derived from multiple tissue types (e.g., lung, liver, skin, heart). Using Pirfenidone and AM-152 as benchmark control compounds, Itraconazole was demonstrated to have efficacy in both bleomycin-induced lung and carbon tetrachloride-induce liver fibrosis mouse models. As such, the FDA approved drug Itraconazole has been identified as a novel lead for the development of a new class of drugs for the treatment of multiple fibrosis related diseases. [00144] A potential limitation to the use of this drug as an anti-fibrotic, especially for the treatment of liver fibrosis, is a known liver toxicity profile that is associated with coordination of heme iron by Ν4 of the 1,2,4 triazole moiety, leading to inhibition of Ρ450 enzymes (most notably Cyp3A4), an activity distinct from the VEGF and Hgh activity of itraconazole. As such, medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at identifying optimized Itraconazole analogues with favorable liver toxicity profiles and further improvements in anti-fibrotic efficacy have been initiated. From an initial panel of -30 Itraconazole analogues, in which the ρΚα of Ν4 is reduced or Ν4 nitrogen is substituted with carbon, several candidate leads have been identified wherein Cyp inhibition activity is eliminated and in vitro anti-fibrotic activity is retained. Notably, the pharmacokinetic properties of these compounds are comparable to those of the parent compound. Based on observed in vitro activity, in vivo efficacy, rodent serum exposure and human exposure data, it is anticipated that a 5-fold improvement in efficacy and/or exposure is desirable for the final clinical candidate. A preliminary structure activity relationship study has revealed that potency enhancement can be achieved by making modifications at sites distal to the triazole substituent. Chemistry efforts are ongoing and will be used to optimize efficacy, exposure (Cmax >5-fold in vitro EC50) and toxicity profiles (based on human off-target panel profiling, hERG and AMES in vitro toxicity assays, and Cyp induction/inhibition assays). Reproducible disease modifying activity, i.e., efficacy equal to or greater than that of existing (pirfenidone) or potential future (AM-152) standards of care, will be demonstrated for an optimized Itraconazole analogue, using both lung and liver rodent fibrosis models.

Unless stated specifically in the specification, a substituted group may include one or more substituents selected from: οχο, amino, -CO2H, nitrile, nitro, hydroxyl, thiooxy, alkyl, alkylene, alkoxy, aryl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, heteroaryl, dialkylamines, arylamines, alkylarylamines, diarylamines, trialkylammonium (-N R3), N-oxides, imides, and enamines; a silicon atom in groups such as trialkylsilyl groups, dialkylarylsilyl groups, alkyldiarylsilyl groups, triarylsilyl groups, perfluoroalkyl or perfluoroalkoxy, for example, trifluoromethyl or trifluoromethoxy. “Substituted” also means any of the above groups in which one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by a higher-order bond (e.g., a double- or triple-bond) to a heteroatom such as oxygen in οχο, carbonyl, carboxyl, and ester groups; and nitrogen in groups such as imines, oximes, hydrazones, and nitriles. For example, “substituted” includes any of the above groups in which one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced with -NH2, -NRgC(=0)NRgRh, -NRgC(=0)0Rh, -NRgS02Rh, -0C(=0)NRgRh, -ORg, -SRg, -SORg, -S02Rg, -0S02Rg, -S020Rg, =NS02Rg, and -S02NRgRh. In the foregoing, Rg and Rh are the same or different and independently hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxy, alkylamino, thioalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, haloalkyl, heterocyclyl, A-heterocyclyl, heterocyclylalkyl, heteroaryl, A-hctcroaryl and/or heteroarylalkyl. In addition, each of the foregoing substituents may also be optionally substituted with one or more of the above substituents. Furthermore, any of the above groups may be substituted to include one or more internal oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen atoms. For example, an alkyl group may be substituted with one or more internal oxygen atoms to form an ether or polyether group. Similarily, an alkyl group may be substituted with one or more internal sulfur atoms to form a thioether, disulfide, etc. [00168] The term “optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, "optionally substituted alkyl" means either "alkyl" or "substituted alkyl" as defined above. Further, an optionally substituted group maybe un-substituted (e.g., -CH2CH3), fully substituted (e.g., -CF2CF3), mono-substituted (e.g., -CH2CH2F) or substituted at a level anywhere in-between fully substituted and mono-substituted (e.g., -CH2CHF2, -CH2CF3, -CF2CH3, -CFHCHF2, etc). It will be understood by those skilled in the art with respect to any group containing one or more substituents that such groups are not intended to introduce any substitution or substitution patterns (e.g., substituted alkyl includes optionally substituted cycloalkyl groups, which in turn are defined as including optionally substituted alkyl groups, potentially ad infinitum) that are sterically impractical and/or synthetically non-feasible. Thus, any substituents described should generally be understood as having a maximum molecular weight of about 1,000 daltons, and more typically, up to about 500 daltons. [00169] An “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount of a compound administered to a mammalian subject, either as a single dose or as part of a series of doses, which is effective to produce a desired therapeutic effect. [00170] “Treatment” of an individual (e.g. a mammal, such as a human) or a cell is any type of intervention used in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual or cell. In some embodiments, treatment includes administration of a pharmaceutical composition, subsequent to the initiation of a pathologic event or contact with an etiologic agent and includes stabilization of the condition (e.g., condition does not worsen) or alleviation of the condition. In other embodiments, treatment also includes prophylactic treatment (e.g., administration of a composition described herein when an individual is suspected to be suffering from a bacterial infection). [00171] A “tautomer” refers to a proton shift from one atom of a molecule to another atom of the same molecule. The compounds presented herein may exist as tautomers. Tautomers are compounds that are interconvertible by migration of a hydrogen atom, accompanied by a switch of a single bond and adjacent double bond. In bonding arrangements where tautomerization is possible, a chemical equilibrium of the tautomers will exist. All tautomeric forms of the compounds disclosed herein are contemplated. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature, solvent, and pH. Some examples of tautomeric interconversions include: O OH \ \ ^ V \ \A λ \aa Η Η Η \A \ nh2 O \A<H OH ν A λ XA λ \ Ν ' \ Ν x ' ' Η nh2 νη Η /χ ,Ν /sν-Ν Τ V| N'NΗ /χΗΝ-~N IN Ν ,Ν /χ ΝΗ [00172] A “metabolite” of a compound disclosed herein is a derivative of that compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized. The term “active metabolite” refers to a biologically active derivative of a compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized. The term “metabolized,” as used herein, refers to the sum of the processes (including, but not limited to, hydrolysis reactions and reactions catalyzed by enzymes, such as, oxidation reactions) by which a particular substance is changed by an organism. Thus, enzymes may produce specific structural alterations to a compound. For example, cytochrome Ρ450 catalyzes a variety of oxidative and reductive reactions while uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferases catalyze the transfer of an activated glucuronic-acid molecule to aromatic alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines and free sulfhydryl groups. Further information on metabolism may be obtained from The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Edition, McGraw-Hill (1996). Metabolites of the compounds disclosed herein can be identified either by administration of compounds to a host and analysis of tissue samples from the host, or by incubation of compounds with hepatic cells in vitro and analysis of the resulting compounds. Both methods are well known in the art. In some embodiments, metabolites of a compound are formed by oxidative processes and correspond to the corresponding hydroxy-containing compound. In some embodiments, a compound is metabolized to pharmacologically active metabolites.

General methods for the preparation of compound as disclosed herein may be derived from known reactions in the field, and the reactions may be modified by the use of appropriate reagents and conditions, as would be recognized by the skilled person, for the introduction of the various moieties found in the formulae as provided herein. [00213] The products of the reactions may be isolated and purified, if desired, using conventional techniques, including, but not limited to, filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography and the like. Such materials may be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data. [00214] Compounds described herein may be prepared as a single isomer or a mixture of isomers. Further Forms of Compounds Disclosed Herein Isomers [00215] Furthermore, in some embodiments, the compounds described herein exist as geometric isomers. In some embodiments, the compounds described herein possess one or more double bonds. The compounds presented herein include ah cis, trans, syn, anti, entgegen (Ε), and zusammen (Ζ) isomers as well as the corresponding mixtures thereof. In some situations, compounds exist as tautomers. The compounds described herein include all possible tautomers within the formulas described herein. In some situations, the compounds described herein possess one or more chiral centers and each center exists in the R configuration, or S confirguration. The compounds described herein include ah diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the corresponding mixtures thereof. In additional embodiments of the compounds and methods provided herein, mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereoisomers, resulting from a single preparative step, combination, or interconversion are useful for the applications described herein. In some embodiments, the compounds described herein are prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. In some embodiments, dissociable complexes are preferred (e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts). In some embodiments, the diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and are separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities. In some embodiments, the diastereomers are separated by chiral chromatography, or preferably, by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. In some embodiments, the optically pure enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in racemization. Labeled compounds [00216] In some embodiments, the compounds described herein exist in their isotopically-labeled forms. In some embodiments, the methods disclosed herein include methods of treating diseases by administering such isotopically-labeled compounds. In some embodiments, th emethods disclosed herein include methods of treating diseases by administering such isotopically-labeled compounds as pharmaceutical compositions. Thus, in some embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein include isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine and chloride, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 180,170,31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36C1, respectively. Compounds described herein, and the metabolites, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, prodrugs, solvate, hydrates or derivatives thereof which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i. ℮., 3H and carbon-14, i. ℮., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavy isotopes such as deuterium, i.e.,2H, produces certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. In some embodiments, the isotopically labeled compounds, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug, solvate, hydrate or derivative thereof is prepared by any suitable method. [00217] In some embodiments, the compounds described herein are labeled by other means, including, but not limited to, the use of chromophores or fluorescent moieties, bioluminescent labels, or chemiluminescent labels. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts [00218] In some embodiments, the compounds described herein exist as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In some embodiments, the methods disclosed herein include methods of treating diseases by administering such pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In some embodiments, the methods disclosed herein include methods of treating diseases by administering such pharmaceutically acceptable salts as pharmaceutical compositions. [00219] In some embodiments, the compounds described herein possess acidic or basic groups and therefore react with any of a number of inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. In some embodiments, these salts are prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention, or by separately reacting a purified compound in its free form with a suitable acid or base, and isolating the salt thus formed. [00220] Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the compounds described herein with a mineral, organic acid or inorganic base, such salts including, acetate, acrylate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, bisulfite, bromide, butyrate, butyn-l,4-dioate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, caproate, caprylate, chlorobenzoate, chloride, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, decanoate, digluconate, dihydrogenphosphate, dinitrobenzoate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, glycolate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hexyne-l,6-dioate, hydroxybenzoate, y-hydroxybutyrate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, iodide, isobutyrate, lactate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, mandelate metaphosphate, methanesulfonate, methoxybenzoate, methylbenzoate, monohydrogenphosphate, 1 -napthalenesulfonate, 2-napthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, palmoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, pyrosulfate, pyrophosphate, propiolate, phthalate, phenylacetate, phenylbutyrate, propanesulfonate, salicylate, succinate, sulfate, sulfite, succinate, suberate, sebacate, sulfonate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate undeconate and xylenesulfonate.

In some embodiments, other acids, such as oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, are employed in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. [00222] In some embodiments, those compounds described herein which comprise a free acid group react with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate, sulfate, of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation, with ammonia, or with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary amine. Representative salts include the alkali or alkaline earth salts, like lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, and aluminum salts and the like. Illustrative examples of bases include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, choline hydroxide, sodium carbonate, N+(Ci_4 alkyl)4, and the like. [00223] Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine and the like. It should be understood that the compounds described herein also include the quatemization of any basic nitrogen-containing groups they contain. In some embodiments, water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are obtained by such quatemization. Solvates [00224] In some embodiments, the compounds described herein exist as solvates. The invention provides for methods of treating diseases by administering such solvates. The invention further provides for methods of treating diseases by administering such solvates as pharmaceutical compositions. [00225] Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and, in some embodiments, are formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Solvates of the compounds described herein can be conveniently prepared or formed during the processes described herein. By way of example only, hydrates of the compounds described herein can be conveniently prepared by recrystallization from an aqueous/organic solvent mixture, using organic solvents including, but not limited to, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or methanol. In addition, the compounds provided herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the compounds and methods provided herein. Polymorphs [00226] In some embodiments, the compounds described herein exist as polymorphs. The invention provides for methods of treating diseases by administering such polymorphs. The invention further provides for methods of treating diseases by administering such polymorphs as pharmaceutical compositions. [00227] Thus, the compounds described herein include all their crystalline forms, known as polymorphs. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. In certain instances, polymorphs have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. In certain instances, various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature cause a single crystal form to dominate. Prodrugs [00228] In some embodiments, the compounds described herein exist in prodrug form. The invention provides for methods of treating diseases by administering such prodrugs. The invention further provides for methods of treating diseases by administering such prodrugs as pharmaceutical compositions. [00229] Prodrugs are generally drug precursors that, following administration to an individual and subsequent absorption, are converted to an active, or a more active species via some process, such as conversion by a metabolic pathway. Some prodrugs have a chemical group present on the prodrug that renders it less active and/or confers solubility or some other property to the drug. Once the chemical group has been cleaved and/or modified from the prodrug the active drug is generated. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they are easier to administer than the parent drug. They are, for instance, bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. In certain insatnces, the prodrug also has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound as described herein which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyamino acid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. (See for example Bundgaard, "Design and Application of Prodrugs" in A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, Krosgaard-Larsen and Bundgaard, Ed., 1991, Chapter 5, 113-191, which is incorporated herein by reference). [00230] In some embodiments, prodrugs are designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. The design of prodrugs to date has been to increase the effective water solubility of the therapeutic compound for targeting to regions where water is the principal solvent. [00231] Additionally, prodrug derivatives of compounds described herein can be prepared by methods described herein are otherwise known in the art (for further details see Saulnier et αℓ., Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 1994, 4, 1985). By way of example only, appropriate prodrugs can be prepared by reacting a non-derivatized compound with a suitable carbamylating agent, such as, but not limited to, 1,1-acyloxyalkylcarbanochloridate, /%/ra-nitrophcnyl carbonate, or the like. Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. Indeed, some of the herein-described compounds are prodrugs for another derivative or active compound. [00232] In some embodiments, prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (℮. g., two, three or four) amino acid residues is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of compounds of the present invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids and also includes 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvaline, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, cirtulline, homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and methionine sulfone. In other embodiments, prodrugs include compounds wherein a nucleic acid residue, or an oligonucleotide of two or more (℮. g., two, three or four) nucleic acid residues is covalently joined to a compound of the present invention. [00233] Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds described herein also include, but are not limited to, esters, carbonates, thiocarbonates, N-acyl derivatives, N-acyloxyalkyl derivatives, quaternary derivatives of tertiary amines, N-Mannich bases, Schiff bases, amino acid conjugates, phosphate esters, metal salts and sulfonate esters. Compounds having free amino, amido, hydroxy or carboxylic groups can be converted into prodrugs. For instance, free carboxyl groups can be derivatized as amides or alkyl esters. In certain instances, all of these prodrug moieties incorporate groups including but not limited to ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities. [00234] Hydroxy prodrugs include esters, such as though not limited to, acyloxyalkyl (e.g. acyloxymethyl, acyloxyethyl) esters, alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl esters, alkyl esters, aryl esters, phosphate esters, sulfonate esters, sulfate esters and disulfide containing esters; ethers, amides, carbamates, hemisuccinates, dimethylaminoacetates and phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, as outlined in Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 1996,19, 115. [00235] Amine derived prodrugs include, but are not limited to the following groups and combinations of groups: as well as sulfonamides and phosphonamides. [00236] In certain instances, sites on any aromatic ring portions are susceptible to various metabolic reactions, therefore incorporation of appropriate substituents on the aromatic ring structures, can reduce, minimize or eliminate this metabolic pathway. Metabolites [00237] In some embodiments, compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II) are susceptible to various metabolic reactions. Therefore, in some embodiments, incorporation of appropriate substituents into the structure will reduce, minimize, or eliminate a metabolic pathway. In specific embodiments, the appropriate substituent to decrease or eliminate the susceptibility of an aromatic ring to metabolic reactions is, by way of example only, a halogen, or an alkyl group. [00238] In additional or further embodiments, the compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II) described herein are metabolized upon administration to an organism in need to produce a metabolite that is then used to produce a desired effect, including a desired therapeutic effect. Pharmaceutical Compositions/Formulations [00239] In another aspect, provided herein are pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II) as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, polymorph, solvate, prodrug, N-oxide, stereoisomer, or isomer thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.

Intermediate-19D was prepared as shown in Scheme I (below), inverting the steps in Schemes A and C such that bromomethyl ketone 19 was reacted with Intermediate A prior to reaction with 1Η-1,2,3-triazole. Scheme I: Synthesis of Intermediate-19D [00362] To a stirred solution of Intermediate-19 (0.75 g - prepared by analogy to the bromoketone precursor for compound 88) in toluene (6.0 ml) was added Intermediate-A (1.53 g), PTSA (0.076 g) and molecular sieves (0.5 g) at RT.

[00363] To a stirred solution of Intermediate-19Α & -19A' (1.0 g) in MDC (10.0 ml) was added pyridine (0.58 ml) at RT under argon atmosphere. Into the resulting mixture, benzoyl chloride (0.43 ml) was added drop-wise before the mixture was allowed to stir at RT overnight.

The resulting mixture was heated with stirring at 130 °C for 24 h. The completion of reaction was monitored by TLC using hexane: ethyl acetate (5:5) as a mobile phase. After completion of the reaction, the resulting mixture was cooled to RT and DMF was removed under vacuum. Residue was dissolved in THF (4.0 ml) before the addition of 32% NaOH aqueous solution (4.0 ml). The resulting mixture was stirred at reflux temperature for 3 h.

[00366] Compound 78 was prepared by analogy to Compound 75 except that 2-acetylthiazole was used instead of 2-acetylpyridine as the initial starting material. Bromination can be carried out by analogy to the synthesis of the bromoketone precursor of compound 88. Part Ε: Synthesis of Compound 88 [00367] Compound 88 is prepared using analogous procedures as those used to prepare Compound 42, substituting cyclobutyl-(N2)triazolyl ketone for Intermediate-14 (Scheme C). Synthesis of cyclobutyl-(N2)triazolyl ketone [00368] To a cooled solution of cyclobutyl-methyl ketone (1 equiv) in Μ℮ΟΗ was added bromine (1 equiv) dropwise at 0 °C for 30 min. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at the same temperature for about 2 h, and then at RT for another 30 min. The unreacted bromine was then quenched carefully with the 10 % aqueous solution of Na2S203. The mixture was then extracted with ether, and washed with NaHCC>3 and brine. The combined organic extract was dried over anhydrous MgSCfi, filtered, and concentrated to afford the desired bromoketone. [00369] To the solution of the bromoketone (1.0 equiv) and triazole (1.2 equiv) in ACN was added DIPEA (1.2 equiv). The resulting reaction mixture was then heated to reflux for 1 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated and purified by flash column chromatography to afford the desired cyclobutyl-triazolyl ketone as a pale yellow oil which solidified slowly with time. [00370] Additional compounds appearing in Table 1 were prepared using procedures analogous to the preceding procedures. Biological Examples EXAMPLE I: Biological Assays [00371] A high content imaging assay, based on a-SMA staining and cell morphological changes associated with fibroblast to myofibroblast transdifferentiation, was established using primary human lung fibroblasts and primary rodent HSCs. Conditions, involving serum starvation and subsequent TGF-P treatment, were identified that facilitate robust in vitro transdifferentiation in a miniaturized (384 well plate) format that is amenable to high throughput small molecule screening. A selective ALK-5 TGF-pi receptor inhibitor (SB-431542) was used as a positive control. The 4 day long assay was amenable to screens on the order of 100,000 wells and facilitated the identification of compounds that selectively inhibit fibroblast to myofibroblast transdifferentiation. This assay was used to identify a hit compound (itraconazole) and was used to evaluate focused panels of itraconazole analogues generated from medicinal chemistry efforts. [00372] The activity of Itraconazole and its analogues was confirmed by analyzing changes in gene expression of multiple genes associated with fibroblast to myofibroblast transdifferentiation using biochemical methods (i.e., Western blot and RT-PCR). These 4-day assays were used to evaluate sets of 6 compounds at a time in 4-point dose response fashion. [00373] a-SMA assays [00374] Quiescent rat hepatic stellate cells were seeded in 384 well plates (350 cells per well) coated with Poly-D-lysine in stellate cell medium (Sciencell). After 24 hour incubation, cells were treated with the indicated doses of itraconazole for 48 hours in the presence of lOng/mL of TGF-pi in hepatic stellate medium. Following fixation and staining with an anti smooth muscle actin antibody, cell morphology was analyzed with a Cellomics cell insight imaging reader (Figure 1 for representative images). Cells were analyzed for mean cellular area of a-SMA staining (Figure 5a) or mean fluorescence intensity of SMA staining (Figure 5b). In this assay itraconazole reproducibly induced dose dependent decreases in both mean cellular area and alpha smooth muscle actin staining, indicating the inhibition of myofibroblast transdifferentiation and activation. [00375] Western blot analyses of fibrosis-related proteins in cells exposed to TGFp and itraconazole (Itra) [00376] Human lung fibroblasts were seeded at 105 cells per well in 6 well dishes in assay medium (2% fetal bovine serum, DMEM). After 24 incubation, medium was changed to assay medium containing TGF-pi (lOng/mL) and simultaneously treated with itraconazole (10 μΜ), SB431542 (10μΜ) or vehicle control (Figure 6). After incubation for 48 hours, cells were harvested by brief trypsinization and centrifugation. Cells were lysed in Cell Lytic Μ (Sigma) and lysate concentrations normalized via absorption readings at 260nm. Samples were boiled in 2Χ sample buffer and 10% beta-mercaptoethanol. Three micrograms of lysate were loaded into each gel lane and then separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% Bis-Tris gels and then transferred via semi dry transfer to PVDF membranes. After blocking in 5% milk in TRIS buffered saline with Tween-20 (0.1%), membranes were exposed to appropriate primary antibodies. Blots were incubated with HRP- conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using film and SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). In this assay itraconazole reproducibly induced dose dependent decreases in levels of induced alpha smooth muscle actin protein levels, indicating the inhibition of myofibroblast transdifferentiation and activation. [00377] Gene expression analysis of human lung fibroblasts treated with itraconazole [00378] Human lung fibroblasts were seeded at 105 cells per well in 6 well dishes in assay medium (2% fetal bovine serum in DMEM). After 24 hours, medium was changed to assay medium containing TGF-pi (lOng/mL) and itraconazole (500ηΜ). After 48 hours of incubation at 37C, cells were harvested by brief trypsinization and centrifugation. RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and cDNA amplified using Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis kit (Fife Technologies). qPCRs reactions were then performed using a fibrosis focused RT2 Profiler PCR Array kit with supplied plate and reagents. Data was analyzed using Ν=1 per reaction per treatment condition. Data was expressed as fold regulation relative to a sample not treated with TGF-pi (Figure 7a). Raw data from the fibrosis focused RT2 Profiler PCR Array is shown in Figure 7b. In this assay itraconazole reproducibly induced dose dependent changes in multiple fibrosis-related genes, indicating the inhibition of myofibroblast transdifferentiation and activation. [00379] Anti-fibrotic activity of itraconazole and analogs thereof did not result from Ρ450 inhibition associated with anti-fungal activity. Itraconazole inhibited VEGF and Hedgehog pro-fibrotic signaling pathways. [00380] qPCR analysis of Hedgehog related genes in rat hepatic stellate cells treated with itraconazole [00381] Rat hepatic stellate cells were seeded at 105 cells per well in 6 well dishes coated with poly-D-lysine in stellate cell medium (Sciencell) and allowed to proliferate to full confluence (~2 weeks). Medium was then switched to DMEM and 0.5% fetal bovine serum with 1 ug/mF SHH-Ν (R&D systems). Cells were treated with SHH-N and compounds (cyclopamine 5μΜ (positive control), itraconazole 1μΜ) for 24 hours. Cells were harvested by brief trypsinzation and centrifugation. RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and cDNA amplified using Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis kit (Fife Technologies). qPCR was performed using a SYBR green mastermix (Takara). Relative levels of PTCH1 (protein patched homo log 1) and GFI1 (GFI family zinc finger 1) mRNA (see Figures 8a and 8b; raw data for both qPCR experiments is shown in Figure 8c) indicated that itraconazole inhibits Hedgehog signaling in rat hepatic stellate cells. [00382] Western blot analyses of COL1-GFP HSCs after knockdown of Smoothened [00383] COF1-GFP HSCs (an immortalized mouse hepatic stellate cell line with GFP knocked into the collagen locus) were plated at 7.55 cells per well in assay medium (10% fetal bovine serum , DMEM). After 24 hours, cells were transduced with lentiviral particles. After 24 hours of incubation with viral particles, cells were switched to fresh assay medium and incubated for 48 hours. Cells were lysed in Cell Lytic Μ (Sigma) and lysate concentrations normalized via absorption readings at 260nm. Samples were boiled in 2Χ sample buffer and 10% beta-mercaptoethanol. Equal amounts of lysate were loaded into each gel lane and then separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% Bis-Tris gels and then transferred via semi dry transfer to PVDF membranes. After blocking in 5% milk in TRIS buffered saline with Tween-20 (0.1%), membranes were exposed to appropriate primary antibodies. Blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using film and SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce); see Figure 9. Constructs for lentivirally delivered shRNAs were obtained from Sigma as MISSION glycerol stocks. Lentiviruses were packaged using 293Τ cells and packaging vectors pMD2.G and pSPAX2. Clones 71, 12, and 95 correspond to shRNAs to SMO and pLKO is plasmid SCH002 which encodes a non-targeting shRNA. shRNA mediated knockdown of SMO and the resultant inhibition of Hedgehog signaling in rat hepatic stellate cells partially recapitulated the anti-fibrotic activity of itraconazole. [00384] Western blot analysis of VEGFR2 migration pattern after treatment with itraconazole [00385] Quiescent rat hepatic stellate cells were seeded at 105 cells per well in 6 well dishes coated with Poly-D-Lysine in stellate cell medium (Sciencell). After 24 hour incubation, cells were then treated with various doses of itraconazole for 24 hours. Cells were harvested by brief trypsinization and centrifugation. Cells were lysed in Cell Lytic Μ (Sigma) and lysate concentrations normalized via absorption readings at 260nm. Samples were boiled in 2Χ sample buffer and 10% beta-mercaptoethanol. Equal amounts of lysate were loaded into each gel lane and then separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% Bis-Tris gels and then transferred via semi dry transfer to PVDF membranes. After blocking in 5% milk in TRIS buffered saline with Tween-20 (0.1%), membranes were exposed to appropriate primary antibodies. Blots were incubated with HRP- conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using film and SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce); see Figure 10. Itraconazole inhibited VEGFR2 glycosylation and trafficking, thereby causing an inhibition of pro-fibrotic VEGF signaling in rat hepatic stellate cells. [00386] Western blot analysis of rat hepatic stellate cells treated with combinations of VEGFR and Hedgehog inhibiting compounds [00387] Quiescent rat hepatic stellate cells were seeded at 105 cells per well in 6 well dishes coated with Poly-D-Lysine in stellate cell medium (Sciencell). After 24 hour incubation, cells were switched to stellate cell medium containing lOng/mL TGF-pi and the indicated combinations of compounds. After 48 hours of treatment, cells were harvested by brief trypsinization and centrifugation. Cells were lysed in Cell Lytic Μ (Sigma) and lysate concentrations normalized via absorption readings at 260nm. Samples were boiled in 2Χ sample buffer and 10% beta-mercaptoethanol. Three micrograms of lysate were loaded into each gel lane and then separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% Bis-Tris gels and then transferred via semi dry transfer to PVDF membranes. After blocking in 5% milk in TRIS buffered saline with Tween-20 (0.1%), membranes were exposed to appropriate primary antibodies. Blots were incubated with HRP- conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using film and SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce); see Figure 11. Pharmacological inhibition of either VEGF or Hedgehog signaling in rat hepatic stellate cells partially recapitulated the anti-fibrotic activity of itraconazole or analogs thereof. Dual pharmacological inhibition of VEGF and Hedgehog signaling in rat hepatic stellate cells recapitulated the anti-fibrotic activity of itraconazole. [00388] Activity of itraconazole and compound 42 in a hedgehog reporter assay [00389] TM3-GLI-LUC cells (stable clone of mouse ΤΜ3 cells expressing Gli-Luc reporter) were harvested and then seeded at 5,000 cells per well in 384 well plates in 40uL of assay medium (DMEM:F12 and 2% fetal bovine serum). Compounds were dissolved in DMSO in serial dilutions and transferred to the assay plates using a lOOnL pintool head on a Biomek automated workstation. After transfer of compounds, lOuL of assay medium containing the small molecule hedgehog agonist SAG was added such that the final assay concentration of SAG was 10ηΜ or 400ηΜ. Assay plates were incubated for 48 hours before using Bright-Glo reagents to determine luminance signals on an Envision plate reader. Relative GLI-LUC activity of ΤΜ3-GLI-LUC cells exposed to 10ηΜ SAG and indicated doses of inhibitor are shown in Figure 12a. Relative GLI-LUC activtity of ΤΜ3-GLI-LUC cells exposed to 400ηΜ SAG and indicated doses of inhibitor are shown in Figure 12b. Ν=3 per dose. Itraconazole and analogs thereof inhibited pro-fibrotic Hedgehog signaling in rat hepatic stellate cells. [00390] Western blot analyses of LX2 human hepatic stellate cells after knockdown of VEFGR1, VEGFR2, or SMO. [00391] LX2 cells (an immortalized human hepatic stellate cells line, Scot Friedman lab) were plated at 105 cells per well in assay medium (10% fetal bovine serum , DMEM). After 24 hours, cells were transduced with lentiviral particles. After 24 hours of incubation with viral particles, cells were switched to fresh assay medium and incubated for 48 hours. Cells were lysed in Cell Lytic Μ (Sigma) and lysate concentrations normalized via absorption readings at 260nm. Samples were boiled in 2Χ sample buffer and 10% beta-mercaptoethanol.

After blocking in 5% milk in TRIS buffered saline with Tween-20 (0.1%), membranes were exposed to appropriate primary antibodies. Blots were incubated with HRP- conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using film and SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce); see Figure 13. Constructs for lentivirally delivered shRNAs were obtained from Sigma as MISSION glycerol stocks. Lentiviruses were packaged using 293Τ cells and packaging vectors pMD2.G and pSPAX2. Clone 65 corresponds to a shRNA targeting SMO, 31 and 32 correspond to a shRNA targeting VEGFR1, clones 86 and 87 correspond to a shRNA targeting VEGFR2, and pLKO is plasmid SCH002 which encodes a non-targeting shRNA. Genetic knockdown of VEGF and Hedgehog signaling in human stellates cells inhibited pro-fibrotic myofibroblast activation and partially recapitulated the anti-fibrotic activity of itraconazole and analogs thereof.

This was done with human liver microsomes rather an isolated enzyme to account for metabolites of parent drug leading to a potential drug-drug interaction through Cyp inhibition. The substrate turnover (for example conversion of midazolam to hydroxyl midazolam) was monitored by LCMSMS (Q1/Q2 = 342.2/203.2). Test compounds were tested in a 7-point dose response curve starting from 50 μΜ to 50 ηΜ (~3-fold dilution series). For Cyp 3Α4, the positive control compound was ketoconazole with an IC50 ~ 25 ηΜ. [00394] The detailed protocol was as follows: • Prepared test compounds and standard inhibitors working solution (100χ). • Pulled microsomes out of the -80°C freezer to thaw on ice, labeled with the date and put back to freezer immediately after using. • Added 20 pL of the substrate solutions to corresponding wells. • Added 20 pL ΡΒ to Blank wells. • Added 2 pL of the test compounds and positive control working solution to corresponding wells. • Added 2 pL Μ℮ΟΗ to No Inhibitor wells and Blank wells. • Prepared HLM working solution. • Added 158 pL of the HLM working solution to all wells of incubation plate. • Pre-warmed the plate for about 10 min at 37°C water bath. • Prepared NADPH cofactor solution. • Added 20 pL NADPH cofactor to all incubation wells. • Mixed and incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C water bath. • At the time point, terminated the reaction by adding 400 pL cold stop solution (200 ng/mL Tolbutamide in ACN). • Centrifuged the samples at 4000 rpm for 20 minutes to precipitate protein. • Transferred 200 μΤ supernatant to 200 pL HPLC water and shook for 10 min. • Analyzed samples by LC/MS/MS.

Compared to competitive CYP inhibition, it has been recognized that MBI is a much greater concern in drug discovery and development, because inactivation of CYPs can lead to non-linear pharmacokinetics and underestimate drug-drug interaction potential. The data from this assay was used in conjunction to the reversible inhibition assay. The TDI assay was generally performed in liver microsomes to assess TDI potential of parent drug as well as metabolites. The readout was an IC50 shift with NADPH (the inactivation/TDI set) to allow for compound to be converted to a reactive species and without NADPH (control set to correct for protein degradation during pre-incubation of 20 minutes). Then both incubation sets were diluted with fresh assay buffer containing NADPH Cyp specific substrates (midazolam for Cyp3 Α4) and inhibition of midazolam hydroxylation was measured by LC-MS/MS (Q1/Q2 = m/z 342.2/203.2). An IC50 shift > 1.5-fold was considered to be positive for time dependent inhibition where the 20 min pre-incubation leads to an increase in potency. Troleandomycin was used as a positive control compound, exhibiting a TDI IC50 shift of >20. Test compounds were tested in a 7-point dose response curve starting from 50 μΜ to 50 ηΜ (~3-fold dilution series). [00397] The detailed protocol was as follows: • Prepared test compounds and positive control working solution (100χ) in 1:1 DMSO/MeOH • Pulled microsomes out of the -80°C freezer to thaw. • Prepared incubation mix and added 147.5 pL to all wells of incubation plate. • Prepared cofactor solution and substrate dilution solution. 0 Added 2.5 pL of the test compounds and positive control working solution to corresponding wells. Final compound concentrations in 7-point dose response from 50 μΜ to 50 ηΜ 0 Added 2.5 pL 1:1 DMSO/MeOH to NIC wells • Pre-warmed the plate for about 10 min at 37°C. • Added 50 pL cofactor to pre-incubation wells • Added 50 pL substrate dilution solution to incubation wells. • Mixed and pre-incubated for 20 minutes at 37°C water bath. • Added 50 pL cofactor to incubation wells; 0 Added 50 pL substrate dilution solution to pre-incubation wells. • Mixed and incubated for 5 minutes at 37°C water bath. • At the time point, terminated the reaction by adding cold 250 pL IS-fortified stop solution to all wells. • Centrifuged the incubation plate at 4000 rpm for 20 min. • Transferred 200 pL supernatant into 200 pL HPLC water and shook for 10 min. • Analyzed samples by LCMS.

PXR activation was evaluated by using a luciferase detection reagent, ONE-Glo™ and represented as RLU. The luminescence light intensity was directly proportional to the extent of PXR activation and accompanying gene transcription in the DPX2 cells. Compounds were tested at 10, 1, and 0.1 μΜ in the assay. Fold of induction = (RLU/RFU of compound treated sample)/ (RLU/RFU of vehicle treated sample), RFU was the signal of cell viability. RLU was the signal of CYP3A metabolism and PXR activation. 0.1% DMSO was used as vehicle. Cell viability was detected by using CellTiter-FluorTM and represented as RFU (Relative Fluorescence Units). [00400] Activation potency was defined as negative, weak, moderate and strong. Negative, weak, moderate and strong activators are those that give < 15%, <40%, <69% and >70%, respectively, of the response produced by 10 μΜ RIF at 10 μΜ. [00401] Compound data obtained from this assay are shown in Table 4. Table 4 Compd # PXR activation (fold induction compared to Rifampicin) 15 -lx (no induction) 42 -1.5χ (no induction) 22 -1.1χ (no induction) Candida albicans anti-fungal MIC potency determination [00402] The wild type Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) was used and Fluconazole, amphotericin Β, itraconazole and terbinafine were purchased from Sigma and used as positive controls. [00403] The highest assay concentration for all test compounds and fluconazole was 100 μΜ. Fluconazole was also tested at the highest concentration of 64 pg/ml, and amphotercin Β and terbinafine at 16 and 64 pg/ml. The test compounds were in DMSO stock solution at a concentration of 10 mM. Two stock solutions in DMSO were prepared for fluconazole at 10 mM and 6.4 mg/ml. Amphotericin Β and terbinafine stock solutions in DMSO were prepared at 1.6 and 6.4 mg/ml. [00404] Serial dilution of 100Χ stock solutions: 4 μ1 of stock solution was added into 196 μ1 of RPMI1640 (MOPS buffered and free of HEPES and sodium bicarbonate) in the first well of a row of a sterile u-bottom 96-well plate. The rest of the wells was filled with 100 μ1 RPMI1640. The 2-fold serial dilution was made sequentially by transferring 100 μ1 solution to the next well and mixing by pipetting, until 11th well. The extra 100 μ1 in 11th well was discarded. Therefore, the compound wells contained 100 μ1 of 2x of testing concentrations of drugs in RPMI1640. The 12th well was filled with only 100 μ1 RPMI1640. [00405] C. albicans 3147 (ATCC 10231) glycerol frozen stock was streaked on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA). The plate was incubated at 35°C ambient atmosphere for 20 h. Single colonies were suspended into sterile saline until turbidity reached 0.1 (1-5x106 CFU/ml) using a Siemens turbidity meter. This suspension was diluted 50x in RPMI1640 in a 15 ml conical, and then it was further diluted 20x in RPMI1640 in a 50 ml conical. This gave 1 -5x 103 CFU/ml suspension and was used as inoculum. The cell density in inoculum was plate-counted to be 4.94x103 CFU/ml. [00406] MIC determination: Within 15 min, 100 μ1 of prepared bacterial inoculum was added into each well of compound/RPMI1640-containing plate. The plates were incubated at 35°C in ambient atmosphere. The photos were taken at 24 h and 48 h. The MIC end points for fluconazole and amphotericin Β were read according to the Μ27-Α3 protocol (Reference Method for Broth Dilution Antifungal Susceptibility Testing of Yeasts; Approved Standard-Third Edition, Μ27-Α3 standard published 01/01/2008 by Clinical and Faboratory Standards Institute). The MIC for compounds for test cmpds and terbinafine (not mentioned in Μ27-Α3 protcol) were read as if they were azoles. [00407] Data for compounds tested in this assay are shown in Table 5.

A snapshot format in mice was used to quickly assess the potential for lead candidates to be orally bioavailable. The snapshot format involved a single dose (typically 20 mg/kg) given orally in a standard vehicle (5% PEG/DMSO in water for example). Compounds were infused directly into MS analysis to determine unique MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) signal that is concentration dependent in either ESI positive or negative modes. HPLC analysis using various solvent gradients was performed from organic and aqueous solution to ensure good peak shape of desired Q1/Q2 masses. Formulations included 45% Cyclodextrin in water (as is used clinically for Itraconazole). Other formulations that may used are solutol, Eudragit, MC/Tween, etc. Standard curves were generated using plasma spiked with compound at various concentrations (10 ng/mL to 2000 ng/mL) to determine linear range of Q1/Q2 mass signal to compound concentration using female mouse heparinized plasma. Mice were dosed orally with compound, plasma samples collected by retro-orbital bleeds. Five time points were collected (30 min, 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24h) into heparinized collection tubes. Protein precipitation was performed and compound extracted in cold acetonitrile and analyzed by MS. Nonwinlin was used for ΡΚ modeling as needed. [00409] Study results are presented in Table 6.

These in vivo assays took 6-8 weeks to complete (including full histological analysis). Typical experiments consisted of groups of 6-8 animals treated with itraconazole (2-4 doses), 1 or 2 itraconazole analogues (2-4 doses), vehicle, and benchmark treatments (pirfenidone and AM-152). AM-152 (Amira Pharmaceuticals) is an LPA1 (Lysophosphatidic acid 1) receptor antagonist. This target has been described as relevant to exacerbation of IPF systems in a mouse bleomycin model (British Journal of Pharmacology (2010), 160, 1699-1713). AM-152 is an advanced compound on this target as has been previously described in more detail in WO 2012/078805 and was used as a positive control and comparator to the compound disclosed in this application. [00411] Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model [00412] Nine-week old Β6 male mice (Taconic farms) were surgically implanted with osmotic pumps delivering 25mg/kg bleomycin for seven days. 17 days after surgery mice were treated with drug for 2 weeks. Drug treatments were administered as described in study design (Figure 14). Previously described anti-fibrotic drugs AM-152 and pirfenidone were used as positive control drugs. Lung sections were stained with Masson’s trichrome and following scanning, eight random fields were taken per animal for analysis. Data are represented as mean and s.e.m. (Figure 15a). A graphical representation of model used to evaluate anti-fibrotic drugs is shown in Figure 15b. Representative images of Masson’s trichrome stained lung from indicated treatment groups are shown in Figure 15c. Stained lung sections were analyzed according to a modified Ashcroft scoring system (Figure 16) and using an unbiased automated image analysis method. Total Masson’s trichrome stained area was generated using an automated image analysis macro in ImageJ. Each image was then converted to an RGB stack, and the threshold for stained area was set such that only lung tissue was included in the analysis while empty spaces such as respiratory ducts and alveoli were excluded. Total stained area was then determined by using the area measurement function within ImageJ. Mean Ashcroft scores and mean percent stained area values indicated that itraconazole and analogs thereof dose dependently decreased lung fibrosis disease severity in this model (Figures 17a and 17b). At a dose of 10 mg/kg (SID), compound 42 decreased lung fibrosis disease severity with efficacy that was as good or better when compared to control compounds AM-152 (30 mg/kg BID) and pirfenidone (400 mg/kg, BID). [00413] Carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis model [00414] Drug treatments were administered as described in study design (Figure 18). Fiver sections were stained with Sirius Red solution. After scanning, 5 random images per animal were generated. Total percent area positive for Sirius Red staining was generated using an automated image macro in Image J. Briefly, each image was converted to a RGB stack, and the threshold for stained area was set such that no nuclei were included in the analysis. Total red area was quantitatively determined by using the area measurement function within ImageJ (Figure 19a). Numerical data of the image analysis of the CCfi-induccd liver fibrosis model is shown in Figure 19b. Representative images of Sirius Red stained liver sections of the CCfi-induccd liver fibrosis model are shown in Figure 19c. Fevels in alpha smooth muscle actin (aSMA) livers were analyzed by western blot (Figure 19d). Pieces of liver from the CCI4 -induced liver fibrosis model were homogenized in PBS with a homogenizer and steel balls. Debris was discarded by centrifugation and lysate concentrated determined by Nanodrop absorbance measurements at 260nm. Equal amounts of lysate were loaded into each gel lane and then separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% Bis-Tris gels and then transferred via semi dry transfer to PVDF membranes. After blocking in 5% milk in TRIS buffered saline with Tween-20 (0.1%), membranes were exposed to appropriate primary antibodies. Blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using film and SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Siruis red staining and western blot analysis indicated that itraconazole dose dependently decreased liver fibrosis disease severity. [00415] Rodent wound healing model [00416] The effect of itraconazole and analogs thereof on normal wound healing was evaluated using a standard rodent wound healing model (study design shown in Figure 20; results in Figure 21). Five days prior to the initiation of the model, mice were anesthetized and the back skin hair was removed using Nair. On day 1, mice were weighed and one sterile biopsy punch (5 mm diameter) was made by punching through the full thickness of the folded back skin (2x5 mm dial holes in total). The size of the wounds was measured daily using calipers. Body weight was monitored twice a week thoughout the study. On day land until the end of the study, drug treatment (25 mg/kg, SID of itraconazole, 25 mg/kg SID compound 42 or vehicle) was administered daily using 5ml/kg dosing volume. On days 7, 11 and 14, animals were euthanized from each group and wounds were collected for histological analysis. When collecting the wounds, wounds were cut out including a few mm of the surrounding skin. For each animal, two pieces of wound were collected and fixed for histology analysis. Itraconazole and compound 42 had no effect on tissue architecture or rates of normal wound healing compared to vehicle controls, based on histological analysis and daily caliper measurements. EXAMPLE III: Phase II Clinical Study for scleroderma [00417] A phase II placebo controlled randomized double blind clinical trial demonstrates Proof of Concept for an optimized anti-fibrotic itraconazole analogue in patients with diffuse cutaneous scleroderma or systemic scleroderma with diffuse cutaneous involvement. Patients that satisfy the enrollment criteria make up two equal groups of 30. The experimental arm is given a single high dose of drug every day for 6 months and the placebo comparator arm will be given placebo every day for 6 months. The single high dose of drug is determined based on preclinical efficacy, target engagement in a preclinical cynomolgus toxicology study and a phase I safety study. The primary outcome measure is a comparison of the efficacy of drug vs placebo based on percent variation in m-RSS (score 0-51,17 site) between inclusion and monthly visits. Secondary outcome measures are a comparison of efficacy of drug vs placebo based on variation in m-RSS between inclusion and follow-up time points (1, 3 and 6 months); assessment of target engagement as determined by expression profiling of hedgehog and VEGFR target genes using skin biopsies obtained at inclusion and at 6 months; assessment of skin thickness at inclusion and 6 months using skin biopsies; assessment of treatment of non-cutaneous symptoms in systemic scleroderma patients; assessment of quality of life using a health assessment questionnaire and the Dermatology Quality of Life Index; and assessment of tolerance of treatment using clinical and laboratory monitoring of side effects (including assessment of signs of negative inotropic effects using cardiac ultrasound). Successful Proof of Concept will be established if >40% of patients have m-RSS improvement (defined as decline in m-RSS of >5.3 units between baseline and last study visit at 6 months). [00418] The precise target patient population consists of patients diagnosed with diffuse (or severe) cutaneous scleroderma (modified Rodnan skin score, m-RSS >16/51). Patients diagnosed with localized diffuse cutaneous scleroderma or systemic scleroderma with diffuse cutaneous involvement, as defined by the American College of Rheumatology, are the known patient subsets. [00419] Inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient recruitment of a phase II proof of concept study are as follows. Patients will be 18 years of age or older with documented diagnosis of cutaneous or systemic scleroderma. A baseline m-RSS of >16/51 indicative of diffuse cutaneous scleroderma is required. A pre-inclusion cardiac ultrasound ejection fraction score of more than 55% (i.e., normal) is required for inclusion. Patients will be excluded if they have been treated with a drug (e.g., methotrexate, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, bosentan) that has the potential to interfere with the course of disease within a 3 month period prior to the start of the trial. Patients suffering from severe organ failure, chronic liver disease (e.g., liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis), cancer, chronic illness (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes, HIV) or having anomalous blood chemistry will be excluded. Patients having had major surgery less than 4 weeks before inclusion will be excluded. Patients contraindicated to itraconazole, as specified in product specifications, will be excluded. Specifically, patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction (e.g., congestive heart failure, CHF), at risk of CHF or having been treated with inotropic drugs will be excluded. Patients having suffered myocardial infarction less than 6 months prior to inclusion will be excluded. [00420] Patients included in a phase II proof of concept study are identified and selected for treatment in collaboration with dermatology clinicians at multiple sites within the United States. A coordinating investigator that is a member of the Scleroderma Clinical Trials Consortium oversees patient recruitment and serves as the study chair. Patients are diagnosed with localized diffuse cutaneous scleroderma or systemic scleroderma with diffuse cutaneous involvement. Patients are stratified based on scleroderma diagnosis (i.e., localized or systemic), sex and age to ensure equal distribution within treatment populations. Additionally, patients are stratified based on the severity of cutaneous involvement to ensure an equal number of patients with severe cutaneous involvement (m-RSS > 20/51) within treatment populations. This stratification requires an initial diagnostic test involving cutaneous induration scale and skin biopsy. Patients are required to undergo a cardiac ultrasound diagnostic test prior to inclusion to ensure normal heart function (ejection fraction score >55%). [00421] As there is currently no treatment indicated directly to inhibit fibrosis in scleroderma patients, there is no comparator agent to be used in studies of patients. The new agent is dosed alone. Patients taking any medication are monitored to ensure that the new agent does not alter the pharmacokinetic and metabolism properties of the medication being taken. [00422] The modified Rodnan skin score (m-RSS) is an identified, measurable and validated biomarker used to evaluate clinical efficacy in scleroderma patients. Briefly, total skin surface is arbitrarily divided into 17 sites. In each area, manual palpitation is used to asses a skin score. The skin score varies from 0-3 based on degree of skin thickening (0, uninvolved; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe). The total skin score is the of sum scores from each of the 17 areas (maximum score of 51). Patients having a score of between 16 and 19 are classified as diffuse and those having a score of >20 are classified as severe. This skin scoring system has been demonstrated to correlate very well with the extent of dermal fibrosis and also correlates well with the extent of fibrosis/dysfunction in internal organs (in systemic scleroderma patients). Target engagement in skin can be assessed by monitoring changes in expression of hedgehog and VEGFR target genes using skin biopsies. EXAMPLE IV: Phase II Clinical Study for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis [00423] The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of compound of formula (I) and formula (II) for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, compared with placebo. The clinical trial is interventional. The allocation of the clinical study participants is randomized; the intervention model is parallel assignment; and there is a double blind masking of the study (subject, caregiver, investigator). The present clinical study primarily measures the rate of change of forced vital capacity, and secondarily measures the safety based on AEs, vital signs and clinical laboratory tests. [00424] The inclusion criteria for patient recruitment are as follows: • Both genders between the ages of 40 and 80 years, inclusive, at randomization. • Have clinical symptoms consistent with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). • Have first received a diagnosis of IPF at least 6 months and no more than 48 months before randomization.
