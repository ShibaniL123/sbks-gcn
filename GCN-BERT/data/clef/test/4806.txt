FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to topical anti-microbial compositions and methods of disinfecting and treating microbial infections of the skin or mucosa. In particular, the present invention relates to methods and compositions utilizing an amino acid carboxylic salts comprised of amino acid anions and quaternary ammonium cations. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Disinfectants are grouped in seven categories. Each of them has some short comings: Alcohol-based agents have wide germicidal activity but poses a fire hazard, provide limited activity in the presence of organic matter, not effective against bacterial and fungal spores. Alcohol-based agents are also in general too expensive. Halogens (Iodine or hypochlorite) are corrosive, have limited activity when in the presence of organic matter, not effective as sporocidal agent and they may stain surfaces. Phenolics (single or multiple) are not sporocidal and are potentially mutagenic. Tar distillates (cresol and cresylic acid) are not sporocidal, but are corrosive and toxic at high concentrations and emit noxious gases. Aldehydes (Glutaraldehyde) are toxic and are mutagens. Oxidizing agents (hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate) are not sporocidal, ineffective in the presence of organic matter; The biocidal activities of quaternary ammonium compositions have been reported. It was noted that didecyldimethyl ammonium compounds, and particularly didecyldimethyl-ammonium chloride, are potential biocides. Preston, J.A.O.C.S. 60:567 (1983) concurs and suggests that maximum fungi-toxicity is exhibited with dialkyldimethyl compounds having C.sub.10-C.sub.12 alkyl groups. Ruseggan, in U.K. Patent Publication No. 650,304, discloses a detergent which includes a tetra alkyl quaternary ammonium halide or hydroxide in which two alkyl groups contain from 6 to 9 carbon atoms in each hydrocarbon group and the other two alkyl groups contain 3 to 9 carbon atoms each together with a weak alkali. Such compositions may also include an alkali substrate (U.K. Patent Publication No. 669,506). Quaternary ammonium compounds have advantages over alcohol-based products. First, although quaternary ammonium compounds are broadly effective antimicrobials, these compounds demonstrate relatively low toxicity to animals. Second, quaternary ammonium compounds are essentially odorless, making them easy to formulate in personal care products. Finally, quaternary ammonium compounds do not degrade or corrode materials, such as steel, plastics, and rubber. U.S. Pat. No. 6,297,285 presented a method for disinfecting a substrate with a biocidal effective amount of a composition of one quaternary ammonium carbonate, bicarbonate, or any combination thereof, a solvent and a surfactant. Quaternary ammonium compounds, such as benzalkonium chloride, possess antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microbial pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. U.S. Pat. No. 7,754,770 uses benzalkonium chloride in antimicrobial composition in a format for no-rinse application to the skin. The formulation tested showed positive eye irritation in accordance with OPPTS 870, 2400 Guidelines. The tested compound is classified as Toxicity category III, indicating corneal involvement or irritation (U.S. Pat. No. 7,754,770, column, line 55). Although benzalkonium chloride is widely used, but it may cause reproductive defects and may act as a mutagen. When degraded some alkyl quaternary ammonium chloride tends to form organic chloride which is toxic and mutagenic. With increased concerns over pathogens in the household and environment, the need for safe disinfectants and sanitizers has increased. Especially with the epidemic spread of SARS, swine flu (H1N1 flu), aviation flu and hand-foot-mouth diseases, there is a continuing and urgent need for safe and strong disinfectant which is not toxic nor cause skin or ocular irritation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to topical compositions for disinfecting and treating microbial infections of the skin or mucosa. The topical compositions relates to a new type of biocidal compounds and the preparation thereof. The new type bactericidal compounds are amino acid carboxylic salts comprised of amino acid anions and non-halogenated quaternary ammonium cations, comprising the general formula: Wherein A-COO− is protected amino acid, wherein A is different feasible amino acid residue derivatives.

Amino acids could be used include: In the above structures, Ac stands for acetyl group, CH3C═O— Acetyl group is bound to the amino group of amino acid to remove the positive charge. The generic amino acid in water is of the following general structure: In order to make it an anion for use as counter ion for the quaternary ammonium amino salt, the positive charge need to be removed by, most often, acetylation; Some of the amino acid residues have side chains that are both charged and chemically reactive, such as cystine, lysine and aspartic acid. The chemical reactivity will be removed for the present invention. In the case of cystine, a methyl group is tethered to the thiol (—SH) group to generate —SCH3. Thiol (—SH) group is reactive and can cause several covalent chemical reactions, —SCH3 is more stable and inert. A series of ammonium salts with different organic anions can be prepared by the following general procedures. First, an organic acid is neutralized by one equivalent of metal hydroxide (such as NaOH or KOH) in volatile organic solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, or in water at low temperature maintained by an ice bath or an acetone thy ice slurry. Second, the volatile organic solvent or water is removed by vacuum to obtain the corresponding salt of metal organic anion in solid form. Third, the metal cation organic anion salt is dissolved in water and mixed with one equivalent of the organic ammonium chloride. Forth, organic solvent is added to the aqueous solution to form two layers, of which the organic components (organic anions and organic ammonium cations) is partitioned in the organic phase, and the byproduct metal cation and inorganic anion remain in the aqueous solution. Fifth, the organic solvent is separated from the aqueous layer and is evaporated by a Rota vapor. Sixth, the aqueous portion is mixed with pure organic solvent to extract more organic salt from the aqueous solution. This extraction is repeated 3 times. Seventh, the organic extracts are combined, and the organic solvent is removed by vacuum to obtain the desired product.
