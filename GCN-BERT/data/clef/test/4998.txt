Fluorescent reactive dyes, process for the production thereof and their use The present invention relates to the technical field of reactive dyestuffs for dyeing and printing of hydroxyl-, amino- and/or carboxamido-containing material. Fluorescent reactive dyes are known from prior art and can be used as colorants in different applications, see for example DE 2337488, EP 153480, DE 2442839 and DE 1955849. However, in the context of the dyeing and printing of hydroxyl-, amino- and/or carboxamido- containing material the known dyes with fluorescence properties have a number of technical disadvantages such as unsatisfactory light fastness and especially limitations in built up and other dyeing properties especially in exhaust processes. Surprisingly, it has now been found that the dyes of formula (I) as described below show highly advantageous properties over the known dyes. These dyes with two or more reactive anchors show good fluorescent properties also in combination / in mixtures with other fluorescent dyes and good overall fastness properties on the materials mentioned above and on blends containing them. Some dye(s) of general formula (I) ( I ) wherein in each case independent from each other W is O, S or NH, R1 and R2 is hydrogen, alkyl, alkyl substituted by one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of methoxy, hydroxy, sulfato, sulfo and chloro, aryl, aryl substituted by one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of chloro, acetylamino, sulfo, hydroxy, carboxy, (Ci-C4)-alkanoyl, (Ci-C4)-alkoxy and (Ci-C4)-alkyl or benzyl, R3 and R4 is hydrogen, alkyl, hydroxy, aryl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, thioalkoxy, N-acylamino, N-cinnamoylamino, halogen, cyano, SO3M, COOM, nitro, acyl, thioacyl, alkylsulfonyl, aryloyl, trifluoromethyl, heteroaryl, heterocycloalkyl, alkoxycarbonyl, alkoxythiocarbonyl, acyloxy, aryloyloxy or SO2-X, wherein X is vinyl or CH2CH2-Y, wherein Y is a group removable under alkaline conditions, Z" is an anion, A1 and A2 is a spacer and T1 and T2 is a reactive anchor have such advantageous technical properties. The chromophore in this invention is a group having the following structure: Attached to it are the spacers A1 and A2. A group removable under alkaline conditions, is a group which will leave the molecule under alkaline conditions to yield a vinyl sulfone. Non-limiting examples of such groups are OSO3M, SSO3M, OCOCH3, OPO3M and halogen. The anion is defined by the production and/or purification process. Non-limiting examples of anions are halogen, sulfates, benzolsulfonates, toluolsulfonates, tetraborofluorates or acetates. Preferred are chloride, bromide and sulfates. A spacer is a group that can react on one side with the chromophore / chromophore precursor and with a second reaction center of the molecule with a reactive anchor. A spacer can be aliphatic-, aromatic- or mixed aliphatic/aromatic. Non-limiting examples are substituted- or unsubstituted-alkylen-diamines for aliphatic-spacers, substituted- or unsubstituted-aniline- /naphthaline-diamines for aromatic-spacers and aminoalkyl substituted anilines-/naphthalines- for mixed aliphatic/aromatic-spacers. A reactive anchor is a group that is directly fixed with a covalent bond to the chromophor or via a spacer that can form a covalent bond to hydroxyl-, amino- and/or carboxamido-containing fibre. This can be achieved with groups having activated leaving groups, such as halogen or OSO3H, which can be replaced in a nucleophilic substitution reaction by the hydroxyl-, amino- and/or carboxamido-containing fibre. Non-limiting examples are: β-chloroethylsulfonyl-groups, 2,3-dibromo-propionic acid derivatives (CO-CHBr-ChbBr) and β-sulfatoethylsulfonyl groups and 2,3-dichloro-quinoxaline. A second reaction type to form a covalent bond to hydroxyl-, amino- and/or carboxamido- containing material is the nucleophilic addition to an activated carbon-carbon double bond by the hydroxyl-, amino- groups of the fibre. Non-limiting examples are: bromo-acrylic (CO-CBr=CH2)-acid derivatives and vinylsulfones (S02-CH=CH2).

The dyes of the present invention can be produced in different ways. Thus the invention is also directed to two processes for the production of the inventive dyes. A process for the production of dyes as described above comprising the steps of: a) Reacting one 3,6,9 substituted 9H-Xanthene, wherein the 3- and 6-substituents react as a leaving group, with two precursor-amines H-NR1-A1-T1 and H-NR2-A2-T2 of identical or different spacer-reactive-anchor-units on 3- and 6-position, b) Sulfonating the OH-groups with concentrated sulfuric acid thus forms an aspect of the present invention. And a process for the production of dyes as described above comprising the steps of: reacting one 3,6,9 substituted 9H-Xanthene, wherein the 3- and 6-substituents react as a leaving group, with a) two identical aliphatic-, aromatic- or mixed aliphatic/aromatic-amines symmetrically on both 3- and 6-position, or b) one aliphatic-, aromatic- or mixed aliphatic/aromatic-amine for the 3-position in a first step and one aliphatic-, aromatic- or mixed aliphatic/aromatic-amine, which is different to the first one, for the 6-position in a second step or c) one aliphatic-, aromatic- or mixed aliphatic/aromatic-amine for the 6-position in a first step and one aliphatic-, aromatic- or mixed aliphatic/aromatic-amine, which is different to the first one, for the 3-position in a second step and further reacting the products resulting from a), b) or c) respectively with reactive anchor groups forms another aspect of the present invention. The compounds, which lead to the sections of the dye-molecule having formula (2c), (2c-1 ), (2d), (2d-1 ), (3d) and (3e) are known and commercially available or can be synthesised by means of common chemical reactions known to a person skilled in the art (see e.g. Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry; Houben-Weil, Methods of Organic Chemistry). The end product, which contains β-sulfatoethylsulfonyl-groups can optionally also be subjected to a vinylization reaction. For example, a vinylizable reaction group such as β- sulfatoethylsulfonyl is converted into its vinyl form. Such reactions are known to a person skilled in the art. They are generally performed in a neutral to alkaline medium at a temperature, for example, from 20 to 80 °C, at a pH of, for example, from 7 to 10. The dyes of formula (I) are fiber-reactive, i.e. are containing fiber-reactive functional rests. Fiber- reactive functional rests refer to rests capable of reacting with the hydroxyl groups of cellulosic materials, the amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl and thiol groups in the case of wool and silk, or with the amino and possibly carboxyl groups of synthetic polyamides to form covalent chemical bonds. The dyes of the present invention are suitable for dyeing and printing of natural, manufactured, regenerated, mechanically or chemically modified, recycled or synthetic hydroxyl-, amino-, and/or carboxamido-containing fiber materials and their blends by the application methods numerously described in the art for reactive dyes. Thus a process for dyeing or printing carboxamido- and/or hydroxyl-containing material, comprising contacting the carboxamido- and/or hydroxyl-containing material with a dye as described above forms another aspect of the present invention. Examples of natural fibre materials as described above are vegetable fibres such as seed fibres i.e. cotton, organic cotton, kapok, coirfrom coconut husk; bast fibers i.e. flax, hemp, jute, kenaf, ramie, rattan; leaf fibres i.e. sisal, henequen, banana; stalk fibres i.e. bamboo; and fibres from animals such as wool, organic wool, silk, cashmere wool, alpaca fiber, mohair, Angora fibre as well as fur and leather materials.

The dyes of the present invention and their salts or mixtures can be used as a single dyeing product in dyeing or printing processes or it can be part of a di/tri or multi-component combination product in dyeing or in printing compositions. The use of a dye as described above, a chemical composition or of an aqueous solution as described below for dying fibers, as well as blends of such fibres selected from the group consisting of: synthetic fiber materials, nylon materials, nylon-6, nylon-6.6 and aramid fibres, vegetable fibres, seed fibres, cotton, organic cotton, kapok, coirfrom coconut husk; bast fibers, flax, hemp, jute, kenaf, ramie, rattan; leaf fibres, sisal, henequen, banana; stalk fibres, bamboo; fibres from animals, wool, organic wool, silk, cashmere wool, alpaca fiber, mohair, Angora fibre as well as fur and leather materials; manufactured, regenerated and recycled fibres, cellulosic fibres; paper fibres, cellulosic regenerated fibres, viscose rayon fibres, acetate and triacetate fibers and Lyocell fibers is another aspect of the present invention.
