The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a chiral compound, in particular to a process for the preparation of a chiral compound which may be used as intermediate for the preparation of antifungal agents, preferably posaconazole. BACKGROUND PRIOR ART Posaconazole (CAS Registry Number 171228-49-2; CAS Name: 2,5-anhydro-1,3,4-trideoxy-2-C-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-4-[[4-[4-[4-[1-[(1S,2S)-1-ethyl-2-hydroxypropyl]-1,5-dihydro-5-oxo-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenoxy]methyl]-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-D-threo-pentitol) is a triazole antifungal drug represented by the structure: Posaconazole is used, for example, to prevent and/or treat invasive fungal infections caused by Candida species, Mucor species, Aspergillus species, Fusarium species, or Coccidioides species in immunocompromised patients and/or in patients where the disease is refractory to other antifungal agents such as amphothericin B, fluconazole, or itraconazole, and/or in patients who do not tolerate these antifungal agents. One of the important intermediates for the preparation of posaconazole is the compound of formula (V) in particular the compound of formula (V) with R1=ethyl To date, no process has been known which affords the compound of formula (V), in particular the compound of formula (V) with R1=ethyl, especially in high enantiomeric, diastereomeric purity and yield. Only the corresponding benzyl protected compound shown below has been described in the literature until now. Unfortunately, the compound of formula (V) with R1=ethyl is not readily accessible via deprotection of the benzyl protected derivative using standard hydrogenolytic conditions. A common intermediate in the process for preparing posaconazole is a compound of formula A process for the preparation of this intermediate is disclosed in WO 95/17407. The overall yield of this process is approximately 25%, and the diastereomeric purity with regard to the isomer of formula is in the range of from 94-99%, with the enantiomeric purity depending on the quality of the starting material lactic methyl ester. WO 95/17407 is completely silent on a purification of said intermediate. WO 97/22579 and Saksena et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 2004, 45 (44), 8249-8251, disclose improved processes for the Grignard reaction carried out in the course of the reaction sequence described in WO 95/17407. A silylation step and addition of tert-BuMgCl to the Grignard reaction is described to afford the intermediate with a purity of 95% without using an additional purification by chromatography. However, the inventors of the present invention, although high-skilled technical experts in this specific chemical area, were not able to reproduce these results. No matter which reasonable modification of the teaching of WO 97/22579 and Saksena et al. was made, the intermediate was always obtained as a complicated mixture which had to be subjected to double chromatography in order to reach the claimed purity. A further process disclosed in WO 96/33163 involves stereochemical resolution of an intermediate via salt formation using chiral acids (e.g. dibenzoyl-L-tartaric acid, L-DBTA) and crystallization of the obtained diastereomeric salts in order to obtain the above-described intermediate in high optical purity. Yet another process, disclosed in WO 97/33178, requires protection of one hydrazine nitrogen in order to introduce the chiral center by reduction with costly reagents with a selectivity of 0-94% with regard to the desired isomer. Neither in WO 96/33163 nor in WO 97/33178 a purification of the products is described, except for the stereochemical resolution. All these methods of the prior art suffer from significant drawbacks. First, the described approaches share the requirement of an OH protecting group both during the synthesis of an intermediate hydrazide and for the subsequent preparation of antifungal agents. In addition, harsh reaction conditions along the synthesis pathways may be regarded as being prohibitive for widely used protecting groups, including silyl ethers and esters. It is believed that solely ethers are stable enough which may be the reason why in all concrete examples, only benzyl ether is consistently disclosed. Second, none of these processes of the prior art allows for a direct preparation of an unprotected compound of formula (V) and, for example, a subsequent protection of the OH group of the compound of formula (V) with a desired protecting group tailor-made for subsequent reactions. Third, as mentioned above, elaborate purification of the oily products by either chromatography or stereochemcial resolution is required to counterbalance the insufficient chemo selectivity and stereoselectivity of the reaction pathways of the prior art. Fourth, multiple oxidation state adjustments on the reaction pathways of the prior art, including a large excess of expensive reagents, increase the number of individual steps and lower the overall yield. These shortcomings considerably decrease the yield of the desired hydrazide of formula (V) and in particular of formula (V) with R1=ethyl and respectively protected derivatives thereof. At the same time large amount of undesired waste products are obtained, making the prior art process even more disadvantageous. Therefore, it was an object of the present invention to provide an efficient process for the production of chiral hydrazides, in particular for the production of a compound of formula (V) with R1=ethyl which may be advantageously used as intermediate for the production of azole antifungal agents, in particular posaconazole. It was a further object of the present invention to provide an efficient process for the preparation of a crystalline compound of formula (V) and in particular of formula (V) with R1=ethyl and, further, for compounds based on this crystalline compound suitably protected at the OH group. It was a further object of the present invention to provide said crystalline compound as such, as well as said suitably protected compounds. Surprisingly, it was found that above-discussed objects are met by a process wherein, in a first stage, a compound of formula with Y being an optionally substituted aryl moiety is provided and reacted with H2N—NH—CHO in a suitable solvent from which a chiral compound of formula is obtained. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a chiral compound, comprising (1) providing a chiral compound of formula (I) wherein Y is an optionally substituted aryl moiety, preferably an optionally substituted phenyl moiety, more preferably unsubstituted phenyl; (2) reacting the compound of formula (I) with H2N—NH—CHO in a solvent to obtain a compound according to formula (II) Further, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a chiral compound, comprising (1) providing a chiral compound of formula (I) wherein Y is an optionally substituted aryl moiety, preferably an optionally substituted phenyl moiety, more preferably unsubstituted phenyl; (2) reacting the compound of formula (I) with H2N—NH—CHO in a solvent to obtain a compound according to formula (II) (3) separating the compound of formula (II) from the reaction mixture obtained from (2) by solvent extraction, wherein prior to (3), a solvent exchange is preferably carried out; (4) reacting the compound of formula (II) in a solvent with a silylating agent comprising the residue —SiRaaRbbRcc to obtain a compound of formula (III) wherein the residues Raa, Rbb and Rcc may be the same or different and are preferably alkyl or aryl residues, more preferably alkyl residues having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 or 2 carbon atoms; (5) reacting the compound of formula (II) or reacting the compound of formula (III) with a nucleophilic compound comprising a nucleophilic residue R1 in a solvent to obtain a compound of formula (IV) (6) reducing the compound of formula (IV), preferably by hydrogenation, to obtain a compound of formula (V) (7) optionally reacting the compound of formula (V) in a solvent with a silylating agent comprising the residue —SiRaRbRc to obtain a compound of formula (VI) wherein the residues Ra, Rb and Rc may be the same or different and are preferably alkyl or aryl residues.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION As mentioned above, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a chiral compound, comprising (1) providing a chiral compound of formula (I) wherein Y is an optionally substituted aryl moiety, preferably an optionally substituted phenyl moiety, more preferably unsubstituted phenyl; (2) reacting the compound of formula (I) with H2N—NH—CHO in a solvent to obtain a compound according to formula (II) Step (1) According to step (1) of the present invention, a compound of formula (I) is provided which is reacted in step (2) with H2N—NH—CHO in a suitable solvent. Generally, there are no specific restrictions as far as providing the compound of formula (I) is concerned. In particular, every conceivable method for the preparation of the compound of formula (I) may be carried out. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, such methods are preferred which allow for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) with high enantioselectivity. According to an even more preferred embodiment of the present invention, such methods are preferred which allow for the preparation of compound (I) wherein at least 95%, more preferably at least 97%, more preferably at least 99% of the molecules of the chiral compound of formula (I) provided in (1) are present as isomer of formula (Ia) For Y=phenyl, the preparation of the compound of formula (I) in an organocatalytic reaction with excellent enantioselectivity is known. Reference is made to Brown et al., J. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125 (36), 10808-10809 and Cordova et al., Chem. Eur. J. 2004, 10 (15), 3673-3684; as well as Hayashi et al. J. Org. Chem. 2005, 69 (18), 5966-5973. According to a preferred embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is provided according to the present invention by reacting propionaldehyde in a suitable solvent with a compound of formula (i) [in-line-formulae]O═N—Y (i).[/in-line-formulae] Residue Y of the compound of formula (i) is an optionally substituted aryl moiety, preferably an optionally substituted phenyl moiety, more preferably unsubstituted phenyl. The term “aryl moiety” as used in this context of the present invention relates to a carbocyclic aromatic group, such as phenyl or naphthyl or the like. The term “substituted aryl moiety” and “substituted phenyl”, respectively, as used in this context of the present invention relates to such aryl moiety and phenyl, respectively, which preferably bears one, two, or three substituents which are preferably selected from the group consisting of halo, alkyl, and C1 alkoxy or C2 alkoxy or C3 alkoxy or C4 alkoxy or C5 alkoxy or C6 alkoxy. The term “alkyl” as used in the context of the present invention relates to straight or branched alkyl moieties which preferably have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 carbon atoms. The term “halo” as used in this context of the present invention in particular relates to a chlorine, a bromine, or a iodine atom. Therefore, in particular, residue Y of the compound of formula (i) is not a benzyl moiety, in particular not an alkylaryl moiety. The term “alkylaryl” moiety as used in the context of the present invention relates to an alkyl moiety which is substituted by at least one aryl moiety. For the sake of illustration, the benzyl moiety is an alkylaryl moiety, wherein alkyl is methyl which is substituted by one phenyl moiety. Thus, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the compound of formula (i) is nitrosobenzene. As far as the reaction of propionaldehyde with the compound of formula (i) is concerned, no specific restrictions exist with the proviso that the compound of formula (I) is obtained, preferably a compound (I) wherein at least 95%, more preferably at least 97%, more preferably at least 99% of the molecules of the chiral compound of formula (I) provided in (1) are present as isomer of formula (Ia) Preferably, at least one, preferably exactly one organocatalyst is employed in the reaction for providing the compound of formula (I). More preferably, proline (Pro), even more preferably D-proline (D-Pro) is employed as organocatalyst. According to an optional embodiment of the present invention, at least one suitable promoter may be employed for promoting the reaction, preferably the organocatalyzed reaction in step (1). While every conceivable promoter can be used, preference is given in the context of the present invention to a urea derivative, with 1-(2-dimethylamino-ethyl)-3-phenyl urea being especially preferred. It was found that carrying out this reaction in the presence of an acid is even more preferred. While generally, no specific restrictions may exist, preference is given to Bronstedt acids, in particular organic Bronstedt acids. According to still further preferred embodiments, acetic acid or propionic acid or a mixture of these acids is employed. No specific restrictions exist as far as the amount of the acids employed is concerned. Catalytical amounts are preferred. Compared to the amounts of the organocatalyst employed, it is even more preferred to employ the acid in a lower amount. According to conceivable embodiments, and based on 1 equivalent of the compound of formula (i), the amount of organocatalyst may be in the range of from 0.15 to 0.5, more preferably in the range of from 0.2 to 0.4, more preferably in the range of from 0.25 to 0.35 equivalents, and the amount of acid may be in the range of from 0.01 to 0.1, more preferably in the range of from 0.02 to 0.09, more preferably in the range of from 0.03 to 0.08 equivalents. The chemical nature of the suitable solvent in which the reaction according to step (1) is carried out will principally depend on the specific starting materials, the catalyst or catalysts employed, the acid or the acids, if employed, and/or the promoter or the promoters being present, if employed. One solvent or a mixture of two or more solvents is conceivable. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention wherein propionaldehyde is reacted with nitrosobenzene in the presence of D-Pro and in the presence of acetic acid and/or propionic acid, the reaction is preferably carried out in dichloromethane (DCM) as solvent. The temperature at which the reaction according to step (1) is carried out will principally depend on the specific starting materials, the catalyst or catalysts employed, the acid or the acids, if employed, and/or the promoter or the promoters being present, if employed. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in particular wherein propionaldehyde is reacted with nitrosobenzene in the presence of D-Pro and in the presence of acetic acid and/or propionic acid in DCM as solvent, the reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of from −15 to +5° C., preferably from −12 to +3° C., more preferably from −10 to 0° C. The atmosphere under which the reaction for providing the compound of formula (I) is carried out will generally depend on the specific starting materials, the solvent or solvents used, the catalyst or catalysts employed, the acid or the acids, if employed, and/or the promoter or the promoters being present, if employed. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention wherein propionaldehyde is reacted with nitrosobenzene in the presence of D-Pro, the reaction is carried out under inert or essentially inert atmosphere, such as in N2 atmosphere. Thus, from the reaction carried out in step (1), the compound of formula (I) is preferably obtained in at least one solvent, preferably DCM, wherein at least 95%, more preferably at least 97%, more preferably at least 99% of the molecules of the chiral compound of formula (I) provided in (1) are present as isomer of formula (Ia) Step (2) Generally, it is conceivable to separate the compound of formula (I) from the reaction mixture obtained from step (1). However, according to a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, no such separation is necessary. Therefore, the present invention also relates to above-described process wherein after (1), the compound of formula (I) is not separated from the reaction mixture obtained from (1) prior to reaction with H2N—NH—CHO in (2). Thus, according to a conceivable embodiment, the reaction mixture obtained from step (1) may be employed in step (2) as such. Alternatively, the reaction mixture may be further diluted with at least one suitable solvent, or, if desired, a suitable amount of solvent may be removed from the reaction mixture by suitable concentration. According to step (2) of the present invention, the compound of formula (I) is reacted with H2N—NH—CHO in a solvent. This solvent may be a solvent mixture if, for example, the reaction mixture obtained from step (1) is admixed with H2N—NH—CHO (formyl hydrazine) contained in a solvent which is different from the solvent contained in the reaction mixture obtained from step (1). According to an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention, the solvent which is contained in the reaction mixture obtained from step (1) is the same solvent which is used for carrying out the reaction in step (2). In particular, this solvent is DCM. As for the reaction in step (1), the temperature at which the reaction according to step (2) is carried out will principally depend on the specific compounds to be reacted with each other, the catalyst or catalysts employed, the acid or the acids, if employed, and/or the promoter or the promoters being present, if employed. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in particular wherein propionaldehyde has been reacted with nitrosobenzene in the presence of D-Pro and in the presence of acetic acid and/or propionic acid in DCM as solvent in step (1), and if also the reaction in step (2) is carried out in DCM as solvent, the reaction in step (2) is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of from −10 to +20° C., preferably from −5 to +5° C. Preferably, the reaction in step (2) is carried out in the presence of at least one molecular sieve. The characteristics of the at least one molecular sieve with respect to the pores can be adapted to the specific needs. However, such sieves are preferred which have pore diameters, determined according to DIN 66131, in the range of from 0.3 to 0.5 nm (nanometre; 3 to 5 Angstrom), preferably from 0.35 to 0.45 nm (3.5 to 4.5 Angstrom), with a pore diameter of about 0.4 nm (4 Angstrom) being especially preferred. The atmosphere under which the reaction in step (2) for providing the compound of formula (II) is carried out will, again, generally depend on the specific compounds to be reacted with each other, the solvent or solvents used, the catalyst or catalysts employed, the acid or the acids, if employed, and/or the promoter or the promoters being present, if employed. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention wherein propionaldehyde has been reacted with nitrosobenzene in the presence of D-Pro and in the presence of acetic acid and/or propionic acid in DCM as solvent in step (1), and if also the reaction in step (2) is carried out in DCM as solvent, the reaction in step (2) is carried out under inert or essentially inert atmosphere, such as in N2 atmosphere. Step (3) From the reaction mixture obtained from step (2), the compound of formula (II) may be separated. While there are no specific restrictions as to how such separation is carried out, solvent extraction is a preferred method according to the present invention. Prior to such extraction, a suitable solvent exchange is preferably carried out. As far as the solvent exchange is concerned, it is especially preferred to exchange the solvent in which the compound of formula (II) is obtained according to step (2) by a solvent or a mixture of two or more solvents which is/are suitable for a preferred further stage of the present invention, such as reaction step (4) described in detail hereinunder. The specific type of solvent will depend on the specific compound of formula (II) and the specific type of subsequent reaction. In case the subsequent reaction is the reaction described hereinunder in step (4), and in case the compound of formula (II) is employed in step (3) preferably contained in DCM, it is preferred to exchange this solvent by MTBE (methyl-tert-butyl ether), ethyl acetate, or a mixture of MTBE and ethyl acetate. Especially preferred is MTBE. According to the present invention, preferred extracting agents are selected from the group consisting of water preferably containing at least one suitable salt, organic ethers, organic esters, and a mixture of two or more thereof, wherein said salt is preferably selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride, sodium hydrogencarbonate, and ammonium chloride. More preferably, the extracting agent is water containing at least one suitable salt, preferably containing one suitable salt, more preferably containing sodium chloride. As far as the amount of salt contained in the water is concerned, typical embodiments are aqueous solutions containing 10 to 30 wt.-% of salt. Further, it is conceivable to suitably crystallize the compound of formula (II) obtained from step (3). No specific restrictions exist as far as such crystallization is concerned with the proviso that at least a portion of the compound of formula (II) crystallizes. Therefore, the present invention also relates to the optionally crystalline compound of formula (II) as such wherein Y is an optionally substituted aryl moiety, preferably an optionally substituted phenyl moiety, more preferably unsubstituted phenyl, wherein preferably at least 95%, more preferably at least 97%, more preferably at least 99% of the molecules of said optionally crystalline compound are present as isomer of formula (IIa) In particular, the present invention relates to the optionally crystalline compound of formula (II) with Y=phenyl, wherein at least 99% of the molecules of said optionally crystalline compound are present as isomer of formula (IIb) An advantage of the process of the present invention is to be seen in the fact that steps (1), (2), and (3) can be carried out in a single reaction vessel. No complicated transfers of reaction mixtures are necessary, allowing in particular for a simplified large-scale production. Step (4) As mentioned above, an aqueous salt solution can be employed as extracting agent. Therefore, prior to a subsequent reaction step it may be desired to remove remaining water from the mixture obtained from solvent extraction. For such water removal, it is possible according to the present invention to employ at least one molecular sieve. The characteristics of the at least one molecular sieve with respect to the pores can be adapted to the specific needs. However, such sieves are preferred which have pore diameters, determined according to DIN 66131, in the range of from 0.3 to 0.5 nm (3 to 5 Angstrom), preferably from 0.35 to 0.45 nm (3.5 to 4.5 Angstrom), with a pore diameter of about 0.4 rim (4 Angstrom) being especially preferred. The water content of the resulting mixtures are most preferably at least 0.1 wt.-%, more preferably at least 0.05 wt.-%. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the compound of formula (II), preferably contained in the solvent as described above, even more preferably after above-described solvent exchange, in particular contained in MTBE, and optionally after removal of remaining traces of water, is reacted in a step (4) with a silylating agent. Thus, the solvent used for this reaction is most preferably MTBE. From this reaction in step (4), a compound of formula (III) is obtained wherein the residues Raa, Rbb and Rcc may be the same or different and are preferably alkyl or aryl residues, more preferably alkyl residues having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 or 2 carbon atoms. The term “aryl residue” as used in this context of the present invention relates to a carbocyclic aromatic group, such as phenyl or naphthyl or the like. The term “alkyl residue” as used in the context of the present invention relates to straight or branched alkyl moieties which preferably have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 carbon atoms. Preferably, the residues Raa, Rbb and Rcc may be the same or different and are alkyl residues. More preferably, the alkyl residues have 1, 2, 3 or 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl. More preferably, the alkyl residues have 1 or 2 carbon atoms. Even more preferably, the residues Raa, Rbb and Rcc are the same, in particular methyl. As far as the silylating agents as such are concerned, no particular restrictions exist with the proviso that at least a portion of the compound of formula (II) is silylated to give the compound of formula (III). For the most preferred embodiments of the present invention wherein Raa, Rbb and Rcc are methyl, the most preferred silylating agent is hexamethyldisilazane, trimethylchlorosilane, bistrimethylsilylacetamide or a mixture of two or three of these compounds, preferably bistrimethylsilylacetamide. The temperature at which the reaction according to step (4) is carried out will principally depend on the specific nature of the compound of formula (III), the specific nature of the silylating agent, and/or the solvent. Preferred temperatures according to the present invention are in the range of from 15 to 70° C. From the reaction mixture obtained, it is conceivable to suitably crystallize the compound of formula (III) obtained from step (4). No specific restrictions exist as far as such crystallization is concerned with the proviso that at least a portion of the compound of formula (III) crystallizes. Therefore, the present invention also relates to compound of formula (III) as such which, according to a conceivable embodiment, may be at least partially crystalline, wherein Y is an optionally substituted aryl moiety, preferably an optionally substituted phenyl moiety, more preferably unsubstituted phenyl, wherein the residues Raa, Rbb and Rcc may be the same or different and are preferably alkyl or aryl residues, more preferably alkyl residues having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 or 2 carbon atoms, in particular methyl, wherein preferably at least 95%, more preferably at least 97%, more preferably at least 99% of the molecules of said chiral compound are present as isomer of formula (IIIa) In particular, the present invention relates to the compound of formula (III) with Y=phenyl, which, according to a conceivable embodiment, may be at least partially crystalline, wherein at least 99% of the molecules of said optionally crystalline compound are present as isomer of formula (IIIb) As mentioned above, according to step (4) of the present invention, the compound of formula (III) is obtained contained in a solvent which is most preferably MTBE. According to this embodiment, the compound of formula (III) is not crystallized. According to an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention, this reaction mixture is subjected without further purification to a further step (5) which is described in detail hereinunder. Therefore, the present invention also relates to above-described process wherein after (4), the compound of formula (III) is not separated from the reaction mixture obtained from (4) prior to reaction with the nucleophilic compound in (5). Step (5) According to such preferred step (5) of the present invention, the compound of formula (III) is reacted with a nucleophilic compound comprising a nucleophilic residue R1 in a solvent to obtain a compound of formula (IV) According to an alternative conceivable process of the present invention, also the compound of formula (II) as described in detail hereinabove can be reacted with a nucleophilic compound comprising a nucleophilic residue R1 in a solvent to obtain a compound of formula (IV) According to this alternative conceivable process, it may not be necessary to carry out step (4) of the present invention. While there are no specific restrictions as far as the nucleophilic compound comprising a nucleophilic residue R1 is concerned with the proviso that reaction of this nucleophilic compound with the compound of formula (III) or with the compound of formula (II) allows for obtaining the compound of formula (IV), this nucleophilic compound is preferably a Grignard compound R1MgX wherein X is preferably selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br, and I. Preferably, residue R1 is a straight or branched alkyl residue which preferably has from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 carbon atoms, more preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, namely 1, 2, 3, or 4 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 or 2 carbon atoms, in particular 2 carbon atoms. Therefore, according to an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention, the nucleophilic compound comprising a nucleophilic residue R1 is a Grignard compound CH3CH2MgX wherein X is selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br, and I. In particular, the nucleophilic compound comprising a nucleophilic residue R1 is CH3CH2MgCl. The solvent or the solvents which is/are used for carrying out the reaction of step (5) of the present invention can be chosen to meet the requirements of the specific nature of the compound of formula (III) or of the compound of formula (II), and the specific nature of the nucleophilic compound. Preferably, the solvent used in reaction of step (5) of the present invention is toluene or at least one ether, wherein the ether is preferably selected from the group consisting of tetrahydrofurane (THF), MTBE, and a mixture of THF and MTBE. The temperature at which the reaction according to step (5) is carried out will principally depend on the specific nature of the compound of formula (III) or of the compound of formula (II), the specific nature of the nucleophilic compound, and/or the solvent used. Preferred temperatures according to the present invention are in the range of from −80 to 0° C., preferably from −75 to −10° C., more preferably from −70 to −25° C. An advantage of the process of the present invention is to be seen in the fact that steps (4), and (5) can be carried out in a single reaction vessel. No complicated transfers of reaction mixtures are necessary, allowing in particular for a simplified large-scale production. Further, according to the present invention, a novel compound of formula (II) and also a novel compound of formula (III) is provided which surprisingly turned out to be more reactive towards Grignard reagents. Thus, in turn, the Grignard reaction described above can be carried out under mild conditions with essentially quantitative diastereoselectivity. From the reaction mixture obtained from this step (5), the compound of formula (IV) may be separated, preferably after quenching the reaction with an appropriate reagent such as water or an alcohol. Preferably an alcohol is used for quenching, more preferably methanol is used. While there are no specific restrictions as to how such separation is carried out, solvent extraction is a preferred method according to the present invention. Prior to such extraction, a suitable solvent exchange may be carried out. According to the present invention, preferred extracting agents are selected from the group consisting of water preferably containing at least one suitable salt, organic ethers, organic esters, and a mixture of two or more thereof, wherein said salt is preferably selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride, sodium hydrogencarbonate, and ammonium chloride. More preferably, the extracting agent is water containing at least one suitable salt, preferably containing one suitable salt, more preferably containing ammonium chloride or sodium chloride. As far as the amount of salt contained in the water is concerned, typical embodiments are aqueous solutions containing 10 to 30 wt.-% of salt. From the reaction mixture obtained, it is conceivable to suitably crystallize the compound of formula (IV) obtained from step (5). No specific restrictions exist as far as such crystallization is concerned with the proviso that at least a portion of the compound of formula (IV) crystallizes.

According to this embodiment, the compound of formula (IV) is not crystallized. According to an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention, this reaction mixture is subjected without further purification to a further step (6) which is described in detail hereinunder. As already indicated in the context of the reaction mixture obtained from step (4) and subjected to step (5), it is noted that also here, no further elaborate and tedious purification such as purification by chromatography is necessary, rendering the inventive process extremely straight-forward and extremely advantageous for large-scale productions.

The hydrogen pressure under which the compound of formula (IV) is reduced is preferably in the range of from 0.5 to 50 bar, preferably from 1 to 20 bar, more preferably from 1 to 10 bar. Typical hydrogen pressures are, for example, in the range of from 1 to 5 bar or from 1 to 2 bar. Typically, a suitable hydrogenation catalyst will be employed. While generally, homogeneous catalysts may be conceivable, heterogeneous catalysts are preferred. As heterogeneous catalysts, elements of the 8th, 9th; 10th, 11th, and 12th subgroup of the PSE are conceivable. As examples, Pt, Rh, Ru, Co, Fe, Cu (such as in the form of copper chromite), Zn (such as in the form of zink chromite), Pd or Ni may be mentioned. According to the present invention, Pd is especially preferred. These elements may be suitably supported. For example, such supports may be mentioned which allow for a better distribution of the elements and a larger surface area. In particular as far as Pd is concerned, carbon is a preferred support. Thus, palladium on carbon, referred to herein as Pd/C, is an especially preferred catalyst according to the present invention. Therefore, the present invention also relates to above-described process, wherein in (6), the hydrogenation is carried out at a temperature in the range of from 15 to 35° C., preferably from 20 to 30° C., at a hydrogen pressure in the range of from 0.5 to 50 bar, preferably from 1 to 20 bar, more preferably from 1 to 10 bar, in the presence of a precious metal containing catalyst, preferably a palladium containing catalyst, most preferably a Pd/C catalyst.

From the reaction mixture obtained from above-described reduction, the reduction catalyst is preferably separated by at least one suitable method such as filtration. The thus separated catalyst may then be washed at least once, preferably with the same solvent or solvent mixture used for the reduction reaction, more preferably with the alcohol used in step (6). Generally, according to a conceivable embodiment of the present invention, the compound of formula (V) obtained from step (6), most preferably after separation of the catalyst, may be used for an optional further reaction, as contained in the solvent or solvent mixture used for the reduction reaction and optionally the washing of the catalyst. Surprisingly, it was found that the reductive cleaving according to step (6) of the present invention leads to the compound of formula (V) as crystalline compound. Therefore, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the compound of formula (V) is crystallized. Therefore, the present invention relates to above-described process which further comprises crystallizing the compound of formula (V). In this context, it is noted that it is believed that according to the teaching of the prior art, in particular the teaching of WO 96/33163 wherein the non-crystalline benzyl-protected compound of formula (V) with R1=ethyl is disclosed, the compound of formula (V) is not accessible as crystalline compound.

Among other conceivable re-crystallization embodiments, re-crystallizing the compound of formula (V) may be preferably carried out in isopropyl acetate or in MIBK (methylisobutylketone) or in a mixture of isopropyl acetate and MIBK. Optionally, such re-crystallization may be carried out in the additional presence of at least one agent suitable for binding certain impurities still contained in the respective mixture. Among others, charcoal may be mentioned as suitable additional agent. Therefore, the present invention relates to above-described process, wherein after crystallization of the compound of formula (V), this compound is re-crystallized at least once in isopropyl acetate or in MIBK or in a mixture of isopropyl acetate and MIBK, optionally in the presence of charcoal. The thus obtained crystals, either after crystallization and/or after re-crystallization, may be suitably dried. Preferably, the drying temperatures are in the range of from 10 to 40° C., more preferably from 15 to 35° C., more preferably from 20 to 30° C. at a pressure of less than 1 bar, preferably less than 500 mbar, more preferably less than 100 mbar.

Therefore, the present invention also relates to above-described process, wherein the compound of (V) is not subjected to purification by chromatography. Clearly, the process according to the present invention is thus highly superior to the prior art processes, in particular as far as medium-scale or large-scale production of the compound of formula (V) is concerned. Consequently, the process according to the present invention provides tremendous advantages especially for such processes according to which the compound of formula (V) is used as starting material for the production of widely used compounds such as, for example, antifungal agents. Thus, the present invention in particular relates to the use of above-described process for the production of a starting material for the production of an antifungal agent, in particular posaconazole. According to a first embodiment of the present invention, the preferably crystalline compound of formula (V), in particular the compound of formula (V) with R1=ethyl, can be used as such for at least one further suitable reaction, such as starting material for the production of an antifungal agent, preferably posaconazole.

EXAMPLES Example 1 Synthesis of the Compound of Formula (II) with Y=phenyl a) 1.70 kg of nitrosobenzene (MW: 107.11; 15.9 mol; 1.0 eq.) were dissolved in 6.16 L of DCM by stirring at 20-25° C. under N2 atmosphere. b) In a separate vessel, 2.76 kg propionaldehyde (MW: 58.08; density: 0.798 g/mL; 47.5 mol; 3.0 eq.) and 5.28 L of DCM were cooled to −6 to −4° C. under N2 atmosphere. To the resulting mixture, 0.057 kg of glacial acetic acid (MW: 60.05; density: 1.049 g/mL; 0.95 mol; 0.06 eq.) and 0.55 kg of D-proline (MW: 115.13; 4.75 mol; 0.3 eq.) were added, and a fine suspension was obtained. c) To this suspension of b), 0.4 L of the nitrosobenzene solution obtained in a) were added. Onset of the reaction was indicated by discoloration of the suspension and a temperature rise up to +3° C. within 1 min. Then, the remaining nitrosobenzene solution (about 7 L) of the nitrosobenzene solution obtained in a) were added at a rate to keep the reaction temperature between −5 and −3° C. The mixture gradually turned darker and resulted in a clear solution when addition was complete. Stirring was then continued for 10 min, and complete conversion was determined using HPLC. The compound of formula (I) with Y=phenyl was obtained as intermediate with an enantiomeric purity expressed as enantiomeric excess (ee)>98%, i.e. more than 99% of the molecules of the chiral compound of formula (I) with Y=phenyl were present as isomer of formula (Ia) with Y=phenyl. Enantiomeric purity was determined analogously to the method described in Brown et al., J. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125 (36), 10808-10809 and using Chiralcel OD-H and n-heptane/isopropanol/diethylamine as eluent. d) Subsequently, 8.8 L of DCM, 3.0 kg of a molecular sieve having pores with a diameter of 0.4 nm (nanometre; 4 Angstrom; commercially available from Aldrich), and 3.14 kg of formyl hydrazine (MW: 60.06; 52 mol; 3.3 eq.) were added at 0-5° C., leading to an increase in temperature. Stirring was continued at 0-5° C. under N2 atmosphere. After 3 hours, complete conversion was determined using HPLC. e) The obtained solids were filtered and washed with 4.4 L of DCM. The solution was concentrated to ¼ of its original volume at a bath temperature of <10° C. Then, 28 L of MTBE were added, and the resulting solution was reduced to ¼ of its original volume by distillation at a bath temperature of <10° C. The resulting organic layer was then diluted with 7 L of MTBE and extracted five times with 28 L of a 20% aqueous sodium chloride solution. Then, 8.8 L of DCM were added for azeotropic removal of water. The resulting solution was concentrated to give 12 kg of a solution of the compound of formula (H) with Y=phenyl in MTBE which contained 2.86 kg of said compound (MW 207.23; 80% yield). f) This solution containing the compound of formula (II) with Y=phenyl was used in the next step (Example 2) without further purification. Example 2 Synthesis of the Compounds of Formula (III) and (IV) with Y=phenyl, and Raa, Rbb and Rcc=methyl and R1=ethyl a) 0.887 kg of the compound of formula (II) as obtained according to Example 1 (MW: 207.23; 4.28 mol; 1.0 eq.), employed as a solution in MTBE (total weight 290 g) which contained about 2 wt.-% of H2O, were dried with 1.54 of a molecular sieve having pores with a pore diameter of 0 4 nm (4 Angstrom; commercially available from Aldrich) at 20-25° C. for 30 min. Thus, the water content was reduced to a value of less than 0.1 wt.-%. Then, the molecular sieve was removed by filtration and washed with 1.7 L of MTBE. The resulting solution was diluted with 16 L of MTBE. The water content of this solution was about 0.05% (0.5 mol; 0.12 eq.). b) Then, 2.8 L of BSA (bistrimethylsilylacetamide) (MW: 203.43; density: 0.832 g/mL; 11.5 mol; 2.7 eq.) were added to the filtrate. The resulting solution was stirred at 20-25° C. After 1 hour, silylation was complete, as detected by 1H-NMR. The compound of formula (III) with Y=phenyl and Raa, Rbb and Rcc=methyl was obtained as intermediate. c) Then, the solution was cooled to −70 to −60° C., and 8.65 L of a solution of ethyl magnesium chloride in THF (2 mol/l; MW: 88.82; density: 0.978 g/ml; 17.3 mol; 4.0 eq.) were added at a rate to keep the reaction temperature between −70 and −60° C. This mixture was stirred for 1 hour at −60° C. Subsequently, the temperature was raised to −25° C., and stirring was continued. After 3 hours, complete conversion was detected by HPLC. The reaction was then quenched by dropwise addition of 5.5 kg of MeOH at a temperature of −25° C. During quenching, the mixture was allowed to warm up to 0-15° C. d) The resulting organic layer was then extracted at 20-25° C. twice with 30 L of a 10% aqueous ammonium chloride solution and once with 30 L of a 20% aqueous sodium chloride solution. The organic layer (20 kg) contained approximately 0.89 kg of the compound of formula (IV) with Y=phenyl and R1=ethyl (MW: 237.30; 80% yield) and was used for the next step (Example 3) without further purification. Example 3 Synthesis of the Compounds of Formula (V) with R1=ethyl a) 0.89 kg of the compound of formula (IV) (MW: 237.30; 3.76 mol; 1.0 eq.), obtained according to Example 2 and used as a solution in MTBE (total weight 20 kg) was diluted with 1 L of MeOH at 20-25° C. b) Then, 0.9 kg of palladium on carbon (Pd/C; 5% Pd; 50% water) were added, and the resulting solution was stirred vigorously at 20-25° C. Reduction reaction was carried out with 1 atm of H2. The vessel was evacuated and vented with 1 atm H2 three times. After 1.5 hours of stirring under H2 atmosphere, complete conversion was detected by HPLC. Then, the suspension was filtrated and the catalyst washed with 1.8 L of MTBE/MeOH (1/1 v/v). The combined filtrates were concentrated to a yellow oil to yield the crude compound of formula (V) with R1=ethyl, containing about 40% (about 0.55 kg) of the compound of formula (V) with R1=ethyl. c) This oil was diluted with 13.9 L of MTBE at 20-25° C., and the resulting solution was seeded. After 1 hour of stirring at 20-25° C., a fine suspension was obtained. Then, 17 L of CHX (cyclohexane) were added, the mixture was cooled to 0° C. and stirred at 0° C. for 3 hours, resulting in a thick suspension of the compound of formula (V) with R1=ethyl. The thus obtained crystals were collected and washed with 2.2 L of a cold (0° C.) mixture of MTBE and CHX (1/1 v/v) to give 0.44 kg of the compound of formula (V) with R1=ethyl after drying (MW 146.19; 80% yield; 64% yield with respect to the compound of formula (II)). More than 99% of the molecules of the chiral compound of formula (V) with R1=ethyl were obtained as isomer according to formula (Vb). 10.4 g of this yellow colored material were added to 50 mL of isopropyl acetate, and the resulting mixture was heated to a temperature of 85 to 89° C. until a solution was obtained. 0.5 g of activated carbon were added to the yellow solution, and after stirring for several minutes, the hot mixture was filtered and allowed to cool to about 5° C. under stirring. After stirring for 2 to 3 hours, the precipitated product was filtered, washed with 5 mL of isopropyl acetate and dried at room temperature under vacuum over night to give 8.54 g of the product as a off-white solid (melting point 78 to 80° C.), i.e. the compound of formula (V) with R1=ethyl, wherein more than 99% of the molecules of said compound were obtained as isomer according to formula (Vb). Preparation of seeds used in this step c): 100 g of the crude oil obtained in step b) where purified by column chromatography using 800 g silica gel 60 (0.063-0.200 mm, Merck) as stationary phase and DCM/methanol=20/1 as mobile phase. The fractions containing the desired product in pure form, as determined by TLC (Merck, silica gel 60 F254, mobile phase CHX/ethyl acetate=1/1), where collected. After evaporation of the solvents the obtained solid was recrystallized from diethyl ether. The resulting crystals where collected and used as seeds after drying (20° C., <100 mbar). d) The IR spectrum and the X-ray diffractogram are shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. Experimental data were obtained as follows: The enantiomeric purity of the compound of formula (V) with R1 mm ethyl as obtained in c) was measured by HPLC as follows: Chromatography HPLC apparatus: Agilent 1200 Column: Waters XBridge C18, 2.5 μm, 50×4.6 mm (order no. 186003090) System: gradient Eluent A: buffer solution pH 7.0 Eluent B: buffer solution pH 7.0/acetonitrile=2/8 (v/v) Flow rate: 1.8 mL/min Oven temperature: 40° C.

Reagent solution prepared according to the following recipe: dissolve 80 to 90 mg of (S)-(−)-α-methylbenzyl isocyanate in acetonitrile and dilute to 1.0 mL with acetonitrile. Sample preparation: a) Test stock solution prepared according to the following recipe: Dissolve 38 to 42 mg of the substance to be tested, weighed accurately to 0.01 mg, in 1.0 mL of acetonitrile. b) Test solution prepared according to the following recipe: In an HPLC vial, mix 100 μL (microliter) of test stock solution and 100 μL (microliter) of reagent solution. Keep at room temperature (20 to 25° C.) for 30 min, add 800 μL (microliter) of buffer solution pH 7.0 and shake well. Then cool the solution on an ice bath (0° C.) for additional 30 min (precipitation of reagent) and filtrate a sample through 0.2 μm (micrometer) directly into another HPLC vial. Infrared spectra (IR) data were collected on a MKII Golden Gate™ Single Reflection Diamond ATR (attenuated total reflection) cell with a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer with 4 cm−1 resolution at ambient conditions. To collect a spectrum a spatula tip of a sample was applied to the surface of the diamond in powder form. Then the sample was pressed onto the diamond with a sapphire anvil and the spectrum was recorded. A spectrum of the clean diamond was used as background spectrum. A typical precision of the wavenumber values is in the range of about ±2 cm−1. Thus, an infrared peak that appears at 1716 cm−1 can appear between 1714 and 1718 cm−1 on most infrared spectrometers under standard conditions. X-ray data (powder diffraction pattern XRPD, X-ray diffractogram) were collected on a Unisantis XMD 300 X-ray powder diffractometer with a position sensitive detector in parallel beam optics using the following acquisition conditions: tube anode: Cu, 40 kV, 0.8 mA; 3-43° theta/2theta; simultaneous detection of regions of 10° per step with detector resolution 1024, counting time 300 seconds per step. Samples were measured at room temperature in a standard sample holder on a rotating sample spinner. A typical precision of the 2-theta values is in the range of ± about 0.2° 2-Theta. Thus a diffraction peak that appears at 5.0° 2-Theta can appear between 4.8 and 5.2° 2-Theta on most X-ray diffractometers under standard conditions.
