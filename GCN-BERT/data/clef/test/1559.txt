To a solution of 2,4-dichloro-5-bromo pyrimidine (0.735 g, 3.23 mmol) in ACN (20 mL) was added (±)-(1R*,2R*)-2-amino-1-methylcyclopentanol (Intermediate 1b, 0.400 g, 3.47 mmol) and triethylamine (0.50 mL, 3.6 mmol). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 4 h, and then concentrated under vacuum. The resulting solid was purified by silica gel chromatography (eluting with 20-70% EtOAc in heptane) to give (±)-(1R*,2R*)-2-[(5-bromo-2-chloropyrimidin-4-yl)amino]-1-methylcyclopentanol (7C, 0.774 g, 78%) as a white solid.
