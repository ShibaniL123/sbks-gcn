Synthesis of Compound 62
The compound 61 (2.58 g, 6.00 mmol) was dissolved in MeCN:CH2Cl2=1:1 (15 mL), NaIO4/H2O (5.13 g, 24.0 mmol, 4.0 eq.)/(12 mL) was added at 10Â° C., and the mixture was stirred. After 15 minutes, RuCl3 (55.5 mg, 0.12 mmol, 0.02 eq.) was added. After 1 hour, NaIO4 (1.30 g, 6.00 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added. After 1.5 hours, the disappearance of the raw material was confirmed by TLC (CHCl3: CH3OH=5:1, 5% sulfuric acid in MeOH). A saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution was added to adjust the pH7.0. Then, the reaction solution was diluted with CH2Cl2 and subjected to extraction. The aqueous layer was adjusted to pH7.0 with 5% citric acid. Then, the aqueous layer was diluted with CH2Cl2 and subjected to extraction. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Then, the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure to obtain a compound 62 (1.73 g, 65%) as a white crystal.
