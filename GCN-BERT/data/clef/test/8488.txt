Preparation of 3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl trifluoromethane sulfonate
A solution of 3-((tert-butyldiphenyl silyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropan-1-ol (1.94 g, 5.55 mmol) and 2,6-dimethylpyridine (1.94 ml, 16.6 mmol) in DCM (18 ml) was cooled to −10° C. (salt/ice bath). Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (1.88 ml, 11.1 mmol) was added slowly dropwise over 10 minutes. The reaction was maintained under these conditions for 2 hours. The reaction was then washed with water, aqueous HCl (1N; 100 mL), and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (2.68 g, 100%) as a red oil.
