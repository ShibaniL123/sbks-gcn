(Synthesis of compound 7 (TMP-CiKD_ALLN))
The compound 6 (ALLN-COOH) (26.8 mg, 0.067 mmol, 1 eq) and TMP-NH2 synthesized separately (Long, M. J. et al., Chem. Biol., 2012, 19 (5) 629-637) (26.0 mg, 0.060 mmol, 0.9 eq) was charged into an eggplant flask, and 2 mL of dehydrate DMF was added. After stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes, 0.1 mL of DIEA was added to neutralize the solution. After stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes, DMT-MM (30.0 mg, 0.11 mmol, 1.6 eq, Code No. 329-53751, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was added directly to the reaction solution, and stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Under cooling conditions, 10 mL of 10 mass% brine/0.1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid was added, and extracted with ethyl acetate for 3 times. This was washed with 0.5 N aqueous hydrochloric acid and then brine, and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After evaporating the solvent under reduced pressure, separation and purification treatment was performed by silica gel chromatography (Code No. 30511-35, Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) (chloroform/methanol = 10/1) to obtain a compound 7 (TMP-CiKD_ALLN) (8.2 mg, 0.010 mmol, 15%, isolated yield).
