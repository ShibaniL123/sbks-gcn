Example 4
Acetal 1b:
A 2-dram vial with a PTFE-lined cap was charged with (3-(benzyloxy)phenyl)methanol (8b, 65.3 mg, 0.305 mmol) and benzoate S1 (113 mg, 0.388 mmol). These were dissolved in DCE (1.00 mL), and TFA (2.2 μL, 0.0297 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was heated to 80° C. and stirred for 16 h. After cooling to room temperature, K2CO3 (82.8 mg, 0.600 mmol) and MeOH (1.00 mL) were added, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 23° C. for 24 h. The mixture was then filtered through a short pad of silica gel, eluting with EtOAc (30 mL), and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (4:1 hexanes/EtOAc eluent) to afford acetal 1b (110 mg, 94% yield, Rf=0.16 in 5:1 hexanes/EtOAc) as a colorless oil.
