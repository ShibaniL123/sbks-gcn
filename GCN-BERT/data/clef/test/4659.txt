(1-3) Synthesis of ethyl 2-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole-5-yl] acetate (Compound 1-3)
To a stirred solution of N-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzimidamide (500 mg) in pyridine (20 mL) was added ethyl 3-chloro-3-oxopropionate (0.7 mL) at room temperature. The solution was heated at 105 °C for 12 hours. After cooling to room temperature, ethyl acetate (40 mL) was added and the whole was washed with saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride (20 mL × 3), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The filtrate was evaporated in vacuo, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography eluting with hexane-ethyl acetate to give the title compound (270 mg, yield 28%).
