Title: Heterologous prime boost vaccination regimen against malaria The invention relates to the field of health care. More particularly, it concerns novel regimens for vaccination against malaria. Backeround of the invention Malaria currently represents one of the most prevalent infections in tropical and subtropical areas throughout the world. Per year, malaria infections kill up to 2.7 million people in developing and emerging countries. The widespread occurrence and elevated incidence of malaria are a consequence of the increasing numbers of drugresistant parasites and insecticide-resistant parasite vectors. Other factors include environmental and climatic changes, civil disturbances and increased mobility of populations. Malaria is caused by mosquito-borne hematoprotozoan parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium. Four species of Plasmodium protozoa (Ρ.falciparum, P.vivax, Ρ.ovale and P.malariae) are responsible for the disease in man; many others cause disease in animals, such as P.yoelii, P.knowlesi and P.berghei. Ρ.falciparum accounts for the majority of infections in humans and is the most lethal type. The two major arms of the pathogen-specific immune response that occur upon entry of the parasite into the body are cellular and humoral. The one arm, the cellular response, relates to CD8+ and CD4+ Τ cells that participate in the immune response. Cytotoxic Τ lymphocytes (CTL’s) express CD8 and are able to specifically kill infected cells that express pathogenic antigens on their surface. CD4+ Τ cells or Τ helper cells support the development of CTL’s, produce various cytokines, and also help induce Β cells to divide and produce antibodies specific for the antigens. During the humoral response, Β cells specific for a particular antigen become activated, replicate, differentiate and produce antigen-specific antibodies. Both arms of the immune response are relevant for protection against a malarial infection. A possible malaria vaccine approach would be most beneficial if it would induce a strong cellular immune response as well as a strong humoral immune response. It is widely accepted that persistent protective immunity against malaria likely requires high levels of Thl type immune responses targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage of the malaria parasites. However, almost forty years after the feasibility of vaccination against malaria was first demonstrated by means of irradiated sporozoites, a vaccine modality that efficiently induces long-lived protective immunity remains elusive. The most advanced CS-based malaria vaccine candidate to date is RTS,S, a vaccine based on a fragment of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein, fused to and admixed with hepatitis Β surface protein. This vaccine confers short term protection against malaria infection with an efficacy of about 50% and induces particularly Βcell and CD4+ T-cell responses. Albeit our understanding about the correlate(s) of protection for malaria is limited, there is ample evidence that circumsporozoite (CS) protein-specific antibodies, CD8+ Τ cells and Thl cytokines, and in particular IFNy, play a central role in controlling the pre-erythrocytic and early liver stages of malaria. Adenoviral vectors appear particularly suited for induction of IFNy-producing CD8+ Τ cells required to combat malaria infection (Ophorst et al, 2006; Rodrigues et al, 1997), due to intracellular expression of a transgene inserted in the vector genome and efficient routing of expressed protein towards the class I presentation pathway. WO 2006/040334 describes prime boost regimens for malaria vaccination, by administering a replication-defective recombinant adenovirus comprising nucleic acid encoding a CS antigen from a malaria-causing parasite and further administering adjuvanted proteinaceous antigen comprising a CS protein or immunogenic fragment thereof, and amongst many other possibilities describes adenovirus serotype 35 (Ad35) and Ad26 as preferred adenoviruses. WO 2006/040334 teaches that priming with the viral vector and boosting with the proteinaceous antigen provides superior results in terms of immune responses compared to the reverse regimen, in particular with respect to IFN-y T-cell responses. A particularly preferred regimen described therein comprises priming with Ad35 encoding a Ρ. falciparum CS antigen and boosting twice with RTS,S. Indeed, this regimen is also demonstrated to be superior to the regimen wherein the order of administration of the protein and adenovirus are reversed in the article by (Stewart et al, 2007). Thus, Ad35 with a CS antigen appears a very suitable priming vaccine for boosting by CS protein. Antibody as well as robust ΠΤ4-γ responses against the CS antigen have also been reported upon a heterologous prime boosts vaccination schedule wherein Ad35 encoding CS was boosted with Ad5 encoding CS (Rodriguez et al, 2009). It has also been shown for the LSA-1 antigen that Ad35 priming followed by protein boosting results in induction of IFN-y producing C.D4+ and CD8+ Τ cells, although it could also be seen that the types of immune responses might differ between different transgenes, e g. CS antigen may behave different from e g. LSA-1 antigen (Rodriguez et al, 2008). In the experience of the inventors, several other prime boost regimens may be different regarding the level of immune responses depending on the antigen, and/or directionality of the prime-boost with respect to the vector used (see also e.g. Abbink et al, 2007). Unpredictability of immune responses with respect to different antigens is further underscored by the observation that recombinant BCG (rBCG) expressing Ρ.falciparum CS protein neither resulted in detectable CS responses when administered alone, nor primed CS responses in a prime-boost schedule with Ad35 expressing CS (unpublished), whereas in contrast another antigen cloned in rBCG could be boosted by subsequent administration of an adenoviral vector with the same transgene and the same has been shown for vaccination against tuberculosis (ΤΒ) by BCG followed by heterologous booster constructs containing ΤΒ transgenes (see Cayabyab et al, 2009, and references therein). Thus, the level and type of immune responses upon vaccination is complex and not fully predictable because it may differ for different transgenes and depend on the type of antigen and administration regimen. In addition, the most preferred regimen known to date requires Ad35 with a CS antigen followed by two boosts with RTS,S (WO 2006/040334; Stewart et al, 2007). Production of RTS, S (adjuvanted protein) is much more expensive than production of adenoviral vectors, and addition of adjuvant is by definition related to a possibility of more (local) side effects, as is known to the skilled person. Thus, administration regimens requiring less adjuvanted protein such as RTS,S while still being capable of strong immune responses would be beneficial. Thus, there remains a need in the art for further effective vaccines and regimens for inducing strong immune responses against malaria antigens, preferably of both arms of the immune system and comprising a strong Thl response. In addition, it would be beneficial if such regimens would require less administrations of adjuvanted protein. The present invention aims at providing such regimens. Summary of the invention The present invention is based on a study that demonstrates that Thl immune response to CS protein, in particular the CD8+ T-cell response, which is needed for strong and lasting malaria immunity, is boosted to sustainable levels using the Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS combination, while at the same time a high level of antibody response is maintained. In this study we evaluated immune responses induced with vaccination regimens based on an adjuvanted yeast-produced complete CS protein followed by two recombinant low seroprevalent adenoviruses expressing Ρ. falciparum CS antigen, Ad35.CS (subgroup Β) and Ad26.CS (subgroup D). Our results show that (i) the yeast-produced adjuvanted full-length CS protein is highly potent in inducing high CS-specific humoral responses in mice, but poor T-cell response (ii) the Ad35.CS vector boosts the IFNy+ CD8+ T-cell response induced by the CS protein immunization and shifts the immune response towards the Thl type and (iii) a three-component heterologous vaccination comprised of a CS protein prime, followed by boosts with Ad35.CS and Ad26.CS, elicits an even more robust and sustainable 1ΤΝγ+ CD8+ T-cell response as compared to one or two component regimens. The Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS combination boosted particularly the 1ΤΝγ+ and ΤΝΡα+ Τ cells, confirming the shift of the immune response from the Th2 to Thl type. The levels of cellular immunity reported herein may warrant a high level of protection against malaria based on long term polyfunctional T-cell responses. These results support the notion of first immunizations of infants with an adjuvanted CS protein vaccine, followed by a booster Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS vaccine at later age, to induce lasting protection against malaria for which the Thl response and immune memory7 is required.

Detailed description of the invention A malaria-causing parasite according to the invention is from the genus Plasmodium, and can for instance be Plasmodium (Ρ.) falciparum, Ρ. vivax, Ρ. ovale, P.malariae, Ρ. yoelii, P.knowlesi or Ρ. berghei. The preferred malaria-causing parasite according to the invention is Ρ. falciparum. A subject according to the invention preferably is a mammal that is capable of being infected with a malaria-causing parasite, for instance a mouse, a non-humanprimate or a human. Preferably, the subject is a human subject. A proteinaceous antigen comprises a polypeptide, which may optionally further comprise modifications and/or additions, such as lipids. In certain embodiments, a proteinaceous antigen is a protein, a glycosylated protein, or a lipoprotein. A preferred proteinaceous antigen comprising CS protein or immunogenic part thereof from a malaria-causing parasite comprises a hybrid protein of CS protein or an immunogenic fragment thereof fused to the surface antigen from hepatitis Β virus (HbsAg), in the form of lipoprotein particles with HbsAg. In a preferred embodiment, the proteinaceous antigen comprises RTS,S. The invention provides methods comprising administering to a subject a priming composition comprising adjuvanted proteinaceous antigen comprising CS protein or immunogenic part thereof, which is also referred to herein as the priming vaccine or priming vaccination; subsequent steps of the methods comprise administering to the subject a first boosting composition comprising a recombinant adenovirus vector that comprises nucleic acid encoding CS protein or immunogenic part thereof, and again subsequently administering to the subject a second boosting composition comprising a recombinant adenovirus vector that comprises nucleic acid encoding CS protein or immunogenic part thereof, which are also referred to herein as the first and second booster/boosting vaccine/vaccination, respectively or booster/boosting vaccines/vaccination collectively. The adjuvanted proteinaceous antigen for use in any or all aspects of the invention may comprise the CS protein ixomP. falciparum, or an immunogenic fragment thereof. In certain embodiments it comprises a full length CS protein, and in other embodiments it comprises an immunogenic part of the CS protein. Immunogenic parts of the CS protein are known to the skilled person. In certain embodiments the proteinaceous antigen comprises the CS protein or immunogenic part thereof in the form of a fusion protein. A proteinaceous antigen can be produced according to routine methods well known to the skilled person, e g. by recombinant expression in one of many available expression systems, e.g. bacteria such as Ε. coli, but preferably in eukaryotic expression systems such as for example yeast, insect cells or mammalian cell lines such as Chinese Hamster Ovary cells or human cell lines. For example, the antigen may comprise a hybrid protein of CS protein or an immunogenic fragment fused to the surface antigen from hepatitis Β virus (HBsAg), which hybrid protein may be expressed in prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells and may take the form of lipoprotein particles. The fusion protein may comprise for example substantially all the C-terminal portion of the CS protein, four or more tandem repeats of the immunodominant region, and the surface antigen from hepatitis Β vims (HBsAg). For example the hybrid protein comprises a sequence which contains at least 160 amino acids which is substantially homologous to the C-terminal portion of the CS protein and may be devoid of the end amino acids from the C-terminal of the CS protein, for example the last 10 to 12 amino acids. The hybrid protein may be in the form of mixed lipoprotein particles, for example with HBsAg. In particular there is provided a hybrid protein as disclosed in WO 93/10152, designated therein as "RTS*" but referred to herein as "RTS", which may be in the form of mixed lipoprotein particles with HBsAg, herein designated RTS,S. The ratio of hybrid protein:S antigen in these mixed particles is for example 1:4. A detailed description of the RTS sequences is provided in WO 2006/040334, incorporated by reference herein. RTS may be in the form of mixed particles, RTS,S, where the ratio of RTS:S is for example 1:4. The protein designated RTS,S is a fusion protein consisting of the C-terminal half of the Ρ. falciparum CS protein (17 of the central 41 NANP-repeats plus most of the C-terminal portion) expressed as a fusion protein with the Hepatitis Β Surface antigen. The proteinaceous antigen comprising CS protein or immunogenic part thereof used as a priming vaccine according to the invention is adjuvanted, meaning that the priming composition comprises at least one adjuvant. Suitable adjuvants for use in the invention include an aluminium salt such as aluminium hydroxide gel (alum) or aluminium phosphate, but may also be a salt of calcium, iron or zinc, or may be an insoluble suspension of acylated tyrosine, or acylated sugars, cationically or anionically derivatised polysaccharides, polyphosphazenes, or montanide liposomes. The adjuvant composition may be selected to induce a preferential Thl response. Moreover, other responses, including other humoral responses, may also be induced. Certain vaccine adjuvants are particularly suited to the stimulation of either Thl or Th2-type cytokine responses. Traditionally, the best indicators of the Thl: Th2 balance of the immune response after a vaccination or infection includes direct measurement of the production of Thl or Th2 cytokines by Τ lymphocytes in vitro after restimulation with antigen, and/or the measurement of the IgGl: IgG2a ratio of antigen specific antibody responses. Thus, a Thl-type adjuvant is one, which stimulates isolated T-cell populations to produce high levels of Thl-type cytokines when re-stimulated with antigen in vitro, and induces antigen specific immunoglobulin responses associated with Thl-type isotype. For example, Thl-type immunostimulants which may be formulated to produce adjuvants suitable for use in the present invention may include Monophosphoryl lipid A, in particular 3-de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A (3D-MPL). 3D-MPL is a well-known adjuvant manufactured by Ribi Immunochem, Montana. Chemically it is often supplied as a mixture of 3-de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A with either 4,5, or 6 acylated chains. It can be purified and prepared by the methods taught in GB 2122204Β, which reference also discloses the preparation of diphosphoryl lipid A, and 3- O-deacylated variants thereof. Other purified and synthetic lipopolysaccharides have been described (US Pat. 6,005,099, ΕΡ 0729473 Bl, ΕΡ 0549074 Bl). In one embodiment, 3D-MPL is in the form of a particulate formulation having a small particle size less than 0.2 pm in diameter, and its method of manufacture is disclosed in ΕΡ 0689454. Saponins are another example of Thl immunostimulants that may be used with the invention. Saponins are well known adjuvants. For example, Quil A (derived from the bark of the South American tree Quillaja Saponaria Molina), and fractions thereof, are described in US Pat. 5,057,540, and ΕΡ 0362279 Bl. The haemolytic saponins QS21 and QS17 (HPLC purified fractions of Quil A) have been described as potent systemic adjuvants, and the method of their production is disclosed in US Pat. 5,057,540 and ΕΡ 0362279 Bl. Also described in these references is the use of QS7 (a non-haemolytic fraction of Quil-A), which acts as a potent adjuvant for systemic vaccines. Combinations of QS21 and polysorbate or cyclodextrin are also known (WO 99/10008). Particulate adjuvant systems comprising fractions of QuilA, such as QS21 and QS7 are described in WO 96/33739 and WO 96/11711. Yet another example of an immunostimulant is an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides ("CpG"). CpG is an abbreviation for cytosine-guanosine dinucleotide motifs present in DNA. CpG is known in the art as being an adjuvant when administered by both systemic and mucosal routes (WO 96/02555, ΕΡ 0468520). Such immunostimulants as described above may be formulated together with carriers, such as, for example, liposomes, oil in water emulsions, and or metallic salts, including aluminium salts (such as aluminium hydroxide). For example, 3D-MPL may be formulated with aluminium hydroxide (ΕΡ 0689454) or oil in water emulsions (WO 95/17210); QS21 may be advantageously formulated with cholesterol containing liposomes (WO 96/33739), oil in water emulsions (WO 95/17210) or alum (WO 98/15287); CpG may be formulated with alum or with other cationic carriers. Combinations of immunostimulants may also be used, such as a combination of a monophosphoryl lipid A and a saponin derivative (WO 94/00153; WO 95/17210; WO 96/33739; WO 98/56414; WO 98/05355; WO 99/12565; WO 99/11241) ora combination of QS21 and 3D-MPL as disclosed in WO 94/00153. Alternatively, a combination of CpG plus a saponin such as QS21 may also be used in the present invention. Thus, suitable adjuvant systems include, for example, a combination of monophosphoryl lipid A, such as 3D-MPL, together with an aluminium salt. Another embodiment combines a monophosphoryl lipid A and a saponin derivative, such as the combination of QS21 and 3D-MPL as disclosed in WO 94/00153, or a less reactogenic composition where the QS21 is quenched in cholesterol containing liposomes (DQ) as disclosed in WO 96/33739. Yet another adjuvant formulation involving QS21,3D-MPL and tocopherol in an oil in water emulsion is described in WO 95/17210. In another embodiment, CpG oligonucleotides are used alone or together with an aluminium salt. A suitable adjuvant for use in the present invention is a preferential Thl stimulating adjuvant, for example an adjuvant comprising a saponin such as QS21 or a monophosphoryl lipid A derivative such as 3D-MPL, or an adjuvant comprising both of these optionally together with cholesterol-containing liposomes, as is described for example in WO 96/33739. According to the present invention, an adenovirus is used as a boosting vaccine. Adenoviruses for use as vaccines are well known and can be manufactured according to methods well known to the skilled person. The adenoviruses used for the invention are recombinant human adenoviruses of serotype 26 (Ad26) and 35 (Ad35). The advantage of this selection of human adenoviruses as vaccine vectors is that humans are not regularly infected with these wild type adenoviruses, so that neutralizing antibodies against these serotypes are less prevalent in the human population at large (WO 00/70071). Recombinant adenoviruses can be produced to very high titers using cells that are considered safe, and that can grow in suspension to very high volumes, using medium that does not contain any animal- or human derived components. Also, it is known that recombinant adenoviruses can elicit a dramatic immune response against the protein encoded by the heterologous nucleic acid sequence in the adenoviral genome. In the genome of the adenovirus, the nucleic acid encoding the transgene(s), here the CS antigen or an immunogenic part thereof, is operably linked to expression control sequences. This can for instance be done by placing the nucleic acid encoding the transgene under the control of a promoter. Further regulatory sequences may be added. A convenient and routine way of doing this is cloning the transgene into an expression cassette, available in many formats from several expression plasmids sold by commercial vendors, which expression cassette usually contains sequences capable of bringing about expression of the nucleic acid, such as enhancer(s), promoter, polyadenylation signal, and the like. Several promoters can be used for expression of the transgenes, and these may comprise viral, mammalian, synthetic promoters, and the like. Non-limiting examples of suitable promoters for obtaining expression in eukaryotic cells, are the CMV-promoter (US 5,385,839), a mammalian EFl-alpha promoter, a mammalian ubiquitin C- promoter, or a SV40 promoter. In certain embodiments, a promoter driving the expression of the transgenes is the CMV immediate early promoter, for instance comprising nt. -735 to +95 from the CMV immediate early gene enhancer/promoter. A polyadenylation signal, for example the bovine growth hormone polyA signal (US 5,122,458), may be present behind the transgenes. The administration of the adenovirus according to the invention will result in expression of the CS antigen in cells of the subject to which the adenovirus is administered. This will result in an immune response to CS in the subject. Thus, the invention provides methods and uses according to the invention, wherein the nucleic acid encoding the CS antigen is expressed in the subject. In certain aspects the invention provides methods and uses according to the invention, so that an immune response against the CS antigen is induced. Preferably, the adenoviral vector is deficient in at least one essential gene function of the El region, eg., the Ela region and/or the Elb region, of the adenoviral genome that is required for viral replication. In certain embodiments, the vector is deficient in at least one essential gene function of the El region and at least part of the non-essential Ε3 region. The adenoviral vector can be "multiply deficient," meaning that the adenoviral vector is deficient in one or more essential gene functions in each of two or more regions of the adenoviral genome. For example, the aforementioned El-deficient or Ε1-, E3-deficient adenoviral vectors can be further deficient in at least one essential gene of the Ε4 region and/or at least one essential gene of the Ε2 region (e.g., the Ε2Α region and/or Ε2Β region). As known to the skilled person, in case of deletions of essential regions from the adenovirus genome, the functions encoded by these regions have to be provided in trans, preferably by the producer cell, i.e. when parts or whole of El, Ε2 and/or Ε4 regions are deleted from the adenovirus, these have to be present in the producer cell, for instance integrated in the genome, or in the form of so-called helper adenovirus or helper plasmids. In certain embodiments, the adenovirus of the invention lacks at least a portion of the El-region, e.g. Ε1Α and/or Ε1Β coding sequences, and further comprises heterologous nucleic acid encoding the CS antigen or an immunogenic part thereof. The construction of adenoviral vectors is well understood in the art and involves the use of standard molecular biological techniques, such as those described in, for example, Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual, 2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, Ν.Υ. (1989), Watson et al., Recombinant DNA, 2d ed., Scientific American Books (1992), and Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Interscience Publishers, NY (1995), and other references mentioned herein. Adenoviral vectors, methods for construction thereof and methods for propagating thereof, are well known in the art and are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,559,099, 5,837,511, 5,846,782, 5,851,806, 5,994,106, 5,994,128, 5,965,541, 5,981,225, 6,040,174, 6,020,191, and 6,113,913, and Thomas Shenk, "Adenoviridae and their Replication", Μ. S. Horwitz, "Adenoviruses", Chapters 67 and 68, respectively, in Virology, Β. Ν. Fields et al., eds., 3d ed., Raven Press, Ltd., New York (1996), and other references mentioned herein. In preferred embodiments, the adenovirus is replication deficient, e.g. because it contains a deletion in the El region of the genome. For the adenoviruses of the invention, being derived from Ad26 or Ad35, it is preferred to exchange the E4-orf6 coding sequence of the adenovirus with the E4-orf6 of an adenovirus of human subgroup C such as Ad5. This allows propagation of such adenoviruses in well known complementing cell lines that express the El genes of Ad5, such as for example 293 cells, PER.C6 cells, and the like (see, e.g. Havenga et al, 2006, WO 03/104467, incorporated in its entirety by reference herein). In certain embodiments, the adenovirus is a human adenovirus of serotype 35, with a deletion in the El region into which the nucleic acid encoding the antigen has been cloned, and with an Ε4 orf6 region of Ad5. In certain embodiments, the adenovirus is a human adenovirus of serotype 26, with a deletion in the El region into which the nucleic acid encoding the antigen has been cloned, and with an Ε4 orf6 region of Ad5. For the Ad35 adenovirus, it is preferred to retain the 3’ end of the Ε1Β 55Κ open reading frame in the adenovirus, for instance the 166 bp directly upstream of the pIX open reading frame or a fragment comprising this such as a 243 bp fragment directly upstream of the pIX start codon, marked at the 5’ end by a Bsu36\ restriction site, since this increases the stability of the adenovirus because the promoter of the pIX gene is partly residing in this area (see, e.g. Havenga et al, 2006; WO 2004/001032, incorporated by reference herein). In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid encoding CS protein or immunogenic part thereof in the recombinant adenovirus vectors of the boosting compositions encode CS protein or immunogenic part thereof having the same amino acid sequence as the CS protein or immunogenic part thereof as present in the priming composition The adenovirus used in the invention comprises nucleic acid encoding CS antigen of a malaria-causing parasite such as Ρ. falciparum. Such adenoviruses and ways of making these have been described before in Havenga et al, 2006; Ophorst et al, 2007; WO 2004/055187, all incorporated in their entirety by reference herein. In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid encodes the entire open reading frame of the CS antigen. In other embodiments, the adenovirus comprises fragments of the coding sequence of the CS antigen, which fragment comprises antigenic parts or epitopes of the CS protein. Preferably, at least part of the GPI signal sequence of the CS protein has been deleted (see e.g. Ophorst et al, 2007). Such constructs have been described in great detail in the examples of WO 2004/055187 (clone 02-659; see fig. 2 therein). Briefly, these adenovectors comprise a heterologous gene encoding for the CS protein with an amino acid sequence that is similar to the CS protein of the NF54 strain, 3D7 clone, having amongst others, an N-terminal signal sequence, 27 ΝΑΝΡ repeats, a cluster of 3 NVDP repeats and one separate NVDP repeat, the universal epitope (Lockyer et al. 1989; Zevering et al. 1994; Nardin et al. 2001), and a deletion of the last 14 amino acids (at the C-terminus). The difference with the protein of RTS,S is that RTS,S lacks the N-terminal signal sequence, and a large portion of the repeat region, as well as most of the C-terminally located GPI anchor signal sequence which is also absent in the adenoviral constructs. In certain embodiments the adenovirus comprises nucleic acid encoding a CS protein as provided by amino acids 1-372 of SEQ ID NO: 6 of WO 2004/055187, incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence encoding the antigens has been codon optimized for expression in humans. In certain embodiments, the adenovirus comprises a nucleic acid sequence comprising nucleotides 13-1128 of SEQ ID NO: 4 of WO 2004/055187, incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. The recombinant adenovirus of serotype 35 comprising nucleic acid encoding the CS antigen or an immunogenic part thereof, is also referred to herein as Ad35.CS. The recombinant adenovirus of serotype 26 comprising nucleic acid encoding the CS antigen or an immunogenic part thereof, is also referred to herein as Ad26.CS. The adenoviruses used in the invention were thus already known as vaccines against malaria, and the instant invention discloses their use particularly preferred novel prime boost regimens. The superior immune responses obtained with these regimens could not be foreseen, given the many different permutations possible. In particular, the prior art actually taught in a completely opposite direction, since it was previously reported that a vaccine regimen of priming with Ad35.CS and boosting with CS protein (RTS,S) gave superior immune responses compared to the reverse regimen wherein CS protein was used as a priming vaccine and Ad35.CS was used as a booster (WO 2006/040334; Stewart et al, 2007). Thus, the instant invention is based on the surprisingly superior immune responses observed using the regimens of the instant invention, wherein the priming vaccine is a CS protein vaccine and the booster vaccines are Ad35.CS and Ad26.CS. In addition, the regimens of the instant invention differ from the most preferred regimes described before wherein Ad35.CS prime was followed by two boosters with the adjuvanted proteinaceous CS-derived antigen RTS,S (WO 2006/040334; Stewart et al, 2007), since the regimens of the instant invention require only one administration of the adjuvanted CS protein or immunogenic part thereof. Advantages of the instant invention therefore include a lower need for expensive adjuvanted CS proteinaceous antigen (RTS,S), while Ad35.CS and Ad26.CS can be manufactured in economically more advantageous manner than the adjuvanted proteinaceoous antigen, and moreover a lower risk for (local) adverse reactions due to the adjuvanted proteinaceous antigen in view of less administrations thereof. Adenoviruses can be prepared, harvested and purified in cell culture systems well known in the art, and for instance WO 2010/060719 and European patent application no 10153581 of Crucell Holland B.V. as filed on 15 February 2010, both incorporated by reference herein, describe suitable methods for obtaining and purifying large amounts of recombinant adenoviruses such as those used in the present invention. Further methods for producing and purifying adenoviruses are disclosed in for example WO 98/22588, WO 00/32754, WO 04/020971, US 5,837,520, US 6,261,823, WO 2005/080556, and WO 2006/108707, all incorporated by reference herein. For administering to humans, the invention may employ pharmaceutical compositions comprising the adenovirus and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In the present context, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means that the carrier or excipient, at the dosages and concentrations employed, will not cause unwanted or harmful effects in the subjects to which they are administered. Such pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients are well known in the art (see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, A. R. Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Company [1990]; Pharmaceutical Formulation Development of Peptides and Proteins, S. Frokjaer and L. Hovgaard, Eds., Taylor & Francis [2000]; and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3rd edition, A. Kibbe, Ed., Pharmaceutical Press [2000]). The purified adenovirus preferably is formulated and administered as a sterile solution. Sterile solutions are prepared by sterile filtration or by other methods known per se in the art. The solutions can then be lyophilized or filled into pharmaceutical dosage containers. The pH of the solution generally is in the range of pH 3.0 to 9.5, e.g pH 5.0 to 7.5. The adenovirus or immunogenic parts thereof typically are in a solution having a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, and the solution of adenovirus may also contain a salt. In certain embodiments, detergent is present. In certain embodiments, the vaccine may be formulated into an injectable preparation. These formulations contain effective amounts of the adenovirus, are either sterile liquid solutions, liquid suspensions or lyophilized versions and optionally contain stabilizers or excipients. The vaccine can also be aerosolized for intranasal administration (see e.g. WO 2009/117134). For instance the adenovirus may be stored in the buffer that is also used for the Adenovirus World Standard (Hoganson et al, Development of a stable adenoviral vector formulation, Bioprocessing March 2002, ρ. 43-48): 20 mM Tris pH 8, 25 mM NaCl, 2.5% glycerol. Another useful formulation buffer suitable for administration to humans is 20 mM Tris, 2 mM MgCF, 25 mM NaCl, sucrose 10% w/v, polysorbate-80 0.02% w/v. Obviously, many other buffers can be used, and several examples of suitable formulations for the storage and for pharmaceutical administration of purified (adeno)virus preparations can for instance be found in European patent no. 0853660, US patent 6,225,289 and in international patent applications WO 99/41416, WO 99/12568, WO 00/29024, WO 01/66137, WO 03/049763, WO 03/078592, WO 03/061708. In certain embodiments one or both of the adenovirus booster vaccines further comprises an adjuvant. Adjuvants are known in the art to further increase the immune response to an applied antigenic determinant, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising adenovirus and suitable adjuvants are for instance disclosed in WO 2007/110409, incorporated by reference herein. In other embodiments, the adenovirus vaccines used in the invention do not comprise further adjuvants. In the methods or uses of the invention, the dose of the adenovirus provided to a patient during one administration can be varied as is known to the skilled practitioner, and is generally between 1χ107 viral particles (νρ) and 1χ1012 νρ, preferably between 1χ108 νρ and 1χ1011 νρ, for instance between 3χ108 and 5χ1010 νρ, for instance between 109and 3χ1010 νρ. Administration of the vaccine according to the invention can be performed using standard routes of administration. Non-limiting embodiments include parenteral administration, such as by injection e.g. into the blood stream, intradermal, intramuscular, etc, or mucosal administration, e.g. intranasal, oral, and the like. In one embodiment the vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. The skilled person knows the various possibilities to administer a vaccine according to the invention, in order to induce an immune response to the antigen(s) in the vaccine. In certain embodiments, the priming vaccine according to the invention (i.e. the adjuvanted proteinaceous antigen comprising CS protein or immunogenic part thereof) is administered to a subject when the subject has an age of between about 0 weeks and about 5 months, e.g. at about 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10, 11, or 12 weeks after birth. In other embodiments, the priming vaccine is administered when the subject has an age of between about 5 and 17 months. In yet further embodiments, the priming vaccine is administered when the subject has an age of between about 1 and 20 years, e.g. between about 1 and 5 years, between about 1 and 2 years. In certain embodiments, the first boosting vaccine (i.e. the composition comprising a recombinant adenovirus vector that comprises nucleic acid encoding CS protein or immunogenic part thereof) is administered within about 2 weeks to 4 months after administering the priming vaccine, e.g. about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 weeks after the administration of the priming vaccine to the subject. In other embodiments, the first boosting vaccine is administered between about 4 and 24 months after administering the priming vaccine. In yet further embodiments, the first boosting vaccine is administered between about 2 and 20 years, e.g. between about 2 and 15, between about 2 and 10, between about 2 and 5 years after the administration of the priming vaccine to the subject. In certain embodiments, the second boosting vaccine (i.e. the composition comprising a recombinant adenovirus vector that comprises nucleic acid encoding CS protein or immunogenic part thereof, and being of the other serotype than the first recombinant adenovirus vector, i.e. Ad26 if the first booster was Ad35 and vice versa) is administered within about 2 weeks to 4 months after administering the first boosting vaccine, e.g. about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 weeks after the administration of the first boosting vaccine to the subject. In other embodiments, the second boosting vaccine is administered between about 4 and 24 months after administering the first boosting vaccine. In yet further embodiments, the second boosting vaccine is administered between about 2 and 20 years, e.g. between about 2 and 15, between about 2 and 10, between about 2 and 5 years after the administration of the first boosting vaccine to the subject. In a preferred regimen, the priming vaccine is administered to the subject when the subject has an age of about 6 weeks, the first boosting vaccine is administered about 1 month later (subject age about 10 weeks), and the second boosting vaccine is administered about another month later (subject age about 14 weeks). This regimen would be suitable for combination with the WHO Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) schedule, which is an important logistical advantage since the vaccines of the invention could be administered during some of the same visits of or to health workers as already recommended for the EPI schedule. The EPI schedule comprises: administration at birth of BCG (a live and attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, which is currently the only available vaccine against tuberculosis) and sometimes OPV (oral polio vaccine); administration at an age of six weeks of OPV, DTP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccine) and Hib (.Haemophilus influenzae type Β vaccine); administration at an age of 10 weeks of OPV, DTP and Hib; administration at an age of 14 weeks of OPV, DTP and Hib; and administration at an age of 9-12 months of measles virus vaccine. The adenovirus vaccine is administered more than once, i.e. one time the Ad35.CS vector is administered according to the invention, and the other administration of adenovirus according to the invention is of the Ad26.CS vector. This can be done in either order, as it has been observed by the inventors that the immune responses against the CS protein encoded by these vectors were similar when these vectors were administered with Ad35.CS as prime and Ad26,CS as booster as with Ad26.CS as prime and Ad35.CS as booster (not shown), and it is anticipated that the earlier priming with CS protein according to the invention will not change this. It is important that the prime boost regimen according to the invention uses three different vaccine compositions for prime, first boost and second boost respectively. In certain embodiments, the first boosting composition comprises Ad35.CS and the second boosting composition comprises Ad26.CS. In certain equivalent embodiments, the adenovirus vectors according to the invention are administered to a subject to which the CS protein or immunogenic fragment thereof has already been administered to the subject previously. Hence, the invention also provides embodiments wherein the boosting adenovirus vaccines are administered to a subject to which a priming composition comprising CS protein or immunogenic part thereof from a malaria-causing parasite has already been administered. In a further equivalent embodiment, the invention provides administering the second booster vaccine according to the invention to subjects to which the priming and first boosting composition have already been administered. It is also possible to administer the adenovirus vaccine more than twice, e g. three times, four times, etc, so that the first boosting vaccination is followed by more than one further boosting vaccination. Also, the adjuvanted proteinaceous antigen comprising CS protein or immunogenic part thereof from a malaria-causing parasite may be administered more than once to the subject, and the second or further administration of the proteinaceous antigen in such embodiments could be performed either before the administration of the first adenovirus according to the invention, between the first and second administration of adenovirus vector according to the invention, or after the administration of the second adenovirus vector according to the invention. However, it is preferred to administer the adjuvanted proteinaceous antigen comprising CS protein or immunogenic part thereof from a malaria-causing parasite to the subject only once. It is also possible to combine the regimens according to the invention with further administration of nucleic acid encoding the CS protein or an immunogenic part thereof, the nucleic acid being part of a different vector, e.g. an adenovirus of a serotype different from Ad35 and Ad26 such as a chimpanzee adenovirus or a human Ad5, Adi 1, Ad34, Ad48, Ad49, Ad50, etc, or a DNA vector, or an MVA vector, etc. In further embodiments, the regimens according to the invention may be combined with the administration of further different malaria antigens, either as protein or in the form of (vectors comprising) nucleic acids encoding such proteins; such different malaria antigens to which immune responses can be generated are known to the skilled person, and include for instance LSA-1. In a further aspect, the invention discloses a method or use similar to the invention, but wherein a composition comprising Ad35.CS is used as a priming vaccine, followed by a composition comprising Ad26.CS as a first boosting vaccine and adjuvanted proteinaceous antigen comprising CS or an immunogenic part thereof as a second boosting vaccine (Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS/CS prot); yet alternatively the priming and first boosting composition according to this aspect are reversed (Ad26.CS/Ad35.CS/CS prot). The driving force behind the development of the immune responses is cytokines, a number of identified protein messengers that serve to help the cells of the immune system and steer the eventual immune response to either a Thl or Th2 response. Thus, high levels of Thl-type cytokines tend to favor the induction of cell mediated immune responses to the given antigen, while high levels of Th2-type cytokines tend to favor the induction of humoral immune responses to the antigen. The distinction of Thl and Th2-type immune responses is not absolute. In reality, an individual will support an immune response that is described as being predominantly Thl or predominantly Th2. Traditionally, Thl-type responses are associated with the production of the IFN-y and IL-2 cytokines by T-lymphocytes. Other cytokines often directly associated with the induction of Thl-type immune responses are not produced by T-cells, such as IL-12. In contrast, Th2-type responses are associated with the secretion of IL-4, IL-5,1L-6, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a). It has been observed that the administration of the vaccine to subjects according to the regimens of the invention, gives rise to CD8+ T-cell responses to CS antigens. In certain aspects therefore, methods and uses according to the invention are provided, wherein the administration of the recombinant adenovirus vector induces a CD8+ T-cell response in the patient against the antigen encoded by the adenovirus vector, meaning that the patient has CD8 lymphocytes releasing cytokines, such as for example IL-2, IFN-y or TNF-a. In certain embodiments, said CD8+ T-cell responses are boosted after a second administration of recombinant adenovirus vector. In certain embodiments, the CD8+ T-cell responses may be polyfunctional, meaning that Τ lymphocytes secrete more than one cytokine. Such polyfunctional Τ lymphocytes may increase the efficiency of the treatments according to the invention. Methods for measuring antigen-specific cellular immune responses such as CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses are well known and routine to the skilled person, and include for instance ELISPOT, intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), and multiplex cytokine assays (see e.g. Havenga et al, 2006; Ophorst et al, 2007; Stewart et al, 2007; Lemckert et al, 2005; O’Connor, 2004; Rodriguez et al, 2008, 2009). Methods for measuring antigen-specific humoral responses (B-cell responses) are also well known and routine to the skilled person, and include measuring antibodies against the antigen, such as by invasion assays and other assays that measure binding of antibodies to parasite or inhibition of parasite functionality (invasion, mobility, etc), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), or preferably by ELISA (see e.g., Ophorst et al, 2007; Stewart et al, 2007; Rodriguez et al, 2008, 2009). The invention is further explained in the following examples. The examples do not limit the invention in any way. They merely serve to clarify the invention. EXAMPLES Example 1: Studies in mice MATERIALS AND METHODS Vector and protein construction, production and purification. El/E3-deleted, replication-incompetent Ad26 and Ad35 vectors expressing the same Ρ. falciparum CS gene were generated in El-complementing PER.C6 cells and purified using CsCl gradients as previously described (e.g. Havenga et al, 2006; WO 2004/055187). Viral particles (νρ) were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Thq Ρ. falciparum CS gene is a synthetic, mammaliancodon optimized insert encoding a CS protein based on the EMBL protein sequence CAH04007, and truncated for the last 14 amino acids at the C-terminus. The Νterminus of this CS protein is a consensus assembled by alignment of various sequences present in the GeiiBank, wdiile the repeat region and the C-terminus are based on the sequence of the 3D7 Ρ. falciparum clone. The CS repeat region consisted of 27 ΝΑΝΡ repeats, a cluster of 3 NVDP and one separate NVDP. C8 protein of identical sequence as in the adenovectors has been produced in Hansemda polymorpha RB11 clone by ARTES Biotechnology GmbH (Germany). A C-terminal His-tag sequence was introduced into the construct to facilitate Ni-column purification of the CS protein from the culture supernatant. Characterization of the yeast-produced CS protein The yeast-produced CS protein was analyzed by CS-specific Western blot and InstantBlue staining, which demonstrated the identity and purity of the CS protein (more than 80% pure) (Fig. la). For the Western blot, rabbit polyclonal antibody againstΡ. falciparum CS (MRA-24, MR4/ATCC) was used in combination with goat-anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxide (HRP, Biorad) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL+, GE healthcare) to detect CS expression. The InstantBlue staining was performed according to protocol provided by the manufacturer (Expedeon). A dose of the yeast-produced CS protein for prime-boost immunogenicity studies was selected using immunization of ΒALB/c mice (η = 5 per group) with increasing dosages of CS protein (5 pg, 10 pg or 25 pg), formulated with the Montanide ISA 720 (Seppic, France) at a 30:70 volume-based ratio, at 3-weeks intervals. The CS-specific humoral response were assessed using ELISA, which demonstrated that the yeast-produced CS protein induces maximal CS-specific antibody responses already at the lowest tested dose (5 pg) and after two immunizations (Fig. lb). The induced IgG response consisted predominantly of IgGl antibodies, indicating the Th2 type response (Fig. 1C). Analysis of the CS-specific cellular immunity using ELISPOT revealed poor induction of Π7Νγ+ T-cells for all doses (data not shown). Animals and vaccinations regimens. Our study seek to evaluate whether vaccination with Ad35.CS and Ad26.CS can enhance the CS-specific immune response induced by a protein-based vaccine (e.g. RTS,S), as potential vaccination strategy for malaria. For these studies we have used a yeast-produced full-length CS protein vaccine. Six to eight week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Harlan (Zeist, The Netherlands) and kept at the institutional animal facility under specific-pathogen-free conditions during the experiment. To evaluate the immunogenicity of the heterologous CS protein/Ad prime-boost regimens, BALB/c mice (η = 8 per group) were primed at week 0 with 5 μg adjuvanted CS protein and boosted at week 4 with 109 νρ Ad35.CS. The optimal immunization doses of Ad.CS for immunization were selected from earlier dose response experiments (data not shown). Another group of mice (η = 8) received a homologous prime-boost regimen of 5 μg adjuvanted CS protein. As negative control group, BALB/c mice (η = 6) were injected at week 0 with adjuvant montanide ISA720 and at week 4 with 109 νρ Ad35.Empty (adenovector without insert; indicated as sham immunization group). To evaluate the 3-component heterologous prime-boost, BALB/C mice (η = 8) were immunized at week 0 with 5 pg adjuvanted CS protein, boosted at week 4 with 109 νρ Ad35.CS and at week 8 with 1010 νρ Ad26.CS. Comparator groups of BALB/C mice (η = 8 per group) started immunization at week 4 with 5 pg adjuvanted CS protein and were boosted after 4 weeks (at week 8) with either 109 νρ Ad35.CS or 5 pg adjuvanted CS protein. As a negative control group, mice (η = 3) received the adjuvant montanide ISA720 at week 0, 109 νρ rAd35.Empty at week 4 and 1010 νρ rAd26.Empty at week 8. CS-specific T-cell assays. CS-specific cellular immune responses in vaccinated mice were assessed using interferon-y (IFN-y) ELISPOT assay, intracellular cytokine staining in combination with surface staining of CD4 and CD8 markers (ICS), as described previously elsewhere (Barouch et al, 2004; Rodriguez et al, 2008), and cytometric bead array (CBA) assay. For the stimulation of splenocytes in the ELISPOT and ICS, a peptide pool consisting of 11-amino acids overlapping 15-mer peptides spanning the whole sequence of the Ρ. falciparum CS protein was used. The pool contained a highly immunodominant CD8+ T-cell epitope (NYDNAGTNL; H-2Kd), which is responsible for the main part of measured responses in the ELISPOT and the CD8+ responses in the ICS. This was confirmed with an experiment wherein the splenocytes were stimulated with the 9-mer peptides, which generated virtually identical responses as the peptide pool (data not shown). For the ELISPOT, ninety-six-well multiscreen plates (Millipore, Bedford, ΜΑ) were coated overnight with 100 pl/well of 10 pg/ml anti-mouse IFN-y (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) in endotoxin-free Dulbecco’s PBS (D-PBS). The plates were then washed three times with D-PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (D-PBS/Tween), blocked for 2 h with D-PBS containing 5% FBS at 37°C, and rinsed with RPM1 1640 containing 10% FBS. Splenocytes from individual mice were stimulated with the CS peptide pool for 18 h at 37°C. Following incubation the plates were washed six times with D-PB S/Tween and once with distilled water. The plates were then incubated with 2 pg/ml biotinylated anti-mouse IFN-y (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for 2 h at room temperature, washed six times with D-ΡΒS/Tween, and incubated for 2 h with a 1:500 dilution of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). Following six washes with D-PB S/Tween and one with PBS, the plates were developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate chromogen (Pierce, Rockford, IL), reaction was stopped with tap water, air dried, and read using an ELISPOT reader (Aelvis GmbH). Spot-forming units (SFU) per 106 cells were calculated. In the case of the ICS, splenocytes from individual animals were stimulated with the CS peptide pool or cultured with medium alone. All cultures contained monensin (GolgiStop; BD Biosciences) as well as 1 pg/ml anti-CD49d (BD Biosciences). The cultured cells were stained with monoclonal antibodies specific for cell surface molecules (CD4 and CD8). After fixing with Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences), cells were permeabilized and stained with antibodies specific for mouse IFNy. Approximately 200,000 to 1,000,000 events were collected per sample. The background level of cytokine staining was typically lower than 0.01% for CD4+ Τ cells and lower than 0.05% for CD8+ Τ cells. The T-helper response induced by the different vaccination regimens was evaluated using Cytometric bead array (CBA) assay. Splenocytes from individual mice were stimulated with 5 pg/ml yeast-produced CS protein. After 48 h of incubation at 37°C, supernatants were harvested and analyzed for the presence of the Thl (IFNy, TNFa, IL-2), Th2 (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10) and Thl7 (IL-17) cytokines using the Mouse Thl/Th2/Thl7 Cytokine Kit according to protocol provided by the manufacturer (BD Biosciences). CS-specific antibody assays. CS-specific antibody responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as previously described (Ophorst et al, 2007). Ninety-six-well microtiter plates (Maxisorp; Nunc) were coated overnight at 4°C with 2 pg/ml of CS-specific (NANP>,C peptide in 0.05 Μ Carbonate buffer (pH 9.6). Plates were washed three times and blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 for 1 h at 37°C. After the plates were washed three times, l:100-diluted individual serum samples were added to the wells and serially twofold diluted in PBS containing 0.2% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20. Plates were incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Plates were washed three times and incubated with biotin-labeled anti-mouse or antirabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Dako, Denmark), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pharmingen San Diego, CA) for 30 min each at 37°C. For detection of the IgG subclasses, samples were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgGl or IgG2a antibodies (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Finally, the plates were washed and 100 μ1 of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was added to each well. After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 pl/well of 1 Μ H2SO4. The optical density was measured at 492 nm using a Bio-Tek reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). The ELISA units were calculated relative to the OD curve of the serially diluted standard serum, with one ELISA unit corresponding to the serum dilution at 50% of the maximum of the standard curve. The IgG2a/IgGl ratio was determined using titer values of IgGl and IgG2a antibodies, which are expressed as a reverse of serum dilution. Statistical analyses. Comparisons of geometric mean immune responses were performed by student /-test after logarithmic transformation to account for two test groups. Comparisons of geometric mean immune responses were performed by analyses of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey adjustments after logarithmic transformation to account for multiple comparisons. In all cases, p-values lower than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS Immunogenicity of CS protein prime followed by Ad35.CS boost. CS-specific humoral response induced in BALB/c mice with an CS protein prime and Ad35.CS boost at two weeks post immunization was assessed by ELISA assay (Fig. 2Α and Β) while the cellular immune responses were measured using IFNy ELISPOT (Fig. 2C) and ICS (Fig. 2D). The homologous prime-boost regimen with the CS protein elicited a very potent CS-specific IgG response. The levels of the antibody response elicited by the heterologous CS protein/Ad35.CS regimen were comparable to that seen for the homologous CS protein prime-boost regimen (Ρ > 0.05 comparing CS-specific IgG levels with ANOVA). Beside the total CS-specific IgG levels, we determined the IgG2a/IgGl ratio to obtain indications of the type of Τhelper responses induced by the different prime-boost regimens (Fig. 2Β). The homologous CS protein prime-boost regimen elicited primarily IgGl antibody responses indicating a more Th2 type immune response while replacing the protein boost with Ad35.CS boost resulted in a more pronounced induction of IgG2a antibodies indicating shift towards a Thl type response (Ρ < 0.05 comparing IgG2a/IgGl ratios with ANOVA). Evaluation of the CS-specific T-cell responses using ELISPOT (Fig. 2C) and ICS (Fig. 2D) assays showed that the homologous CS protein regimen evoked a poor but measurable CS-specific T-cell response. The inclusion of Ad35.CS as a boost to the CS protein prime resulted in significantly increased levels of CS-specific ΠΤ4γproducing CD8+ T-cells (Ρ < 0.05 comparing CS-specific CD8+ T-cell levels with ANOVA). This correlated to the more Thl type response for the CS protein/Ad35.CS regimens as determined by CS-specific IgG2a/IgGl ratio. It should be noted that IFNy+ CD4+ response might have been underestimated using the stimulation with the 15-mer peptides. Stimulation of splenocytes with the CS-protein in the current study did show higher CD4+ responses, however, the background in the assay was unacceptably high (not shown). Immunogenicity of a three-component heterologous prime-boost regimen. The combination of the yeast-produced CS protein with the Ad35.CS in a heterologous prime-boost regimen results in the induction of high level of IFNy+ CD8+ Τ cells, maintained high level of CS-specific IgG response and the antibody response was shifted towards the Thl type. We next investigated whether a prime-boost regimen comprised of the three components, CS protein, Ad35.CS and Ad26.CS, might result in an even more robust and sustained Thl immune response. Our earlier experiments demonstrated that the Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS combination induces significantly higher immune responses than the Ad35.CS/Ad35.CS combination (data not shown) and, therefore, the homologous adenovector combination Ad35.CS/Ad35.CS was not included as a booster vaccine in the current study. A group of mice received a prime with adjuvanted CS protein and a boost with Ad35.CS followed by a second boost with Ad26.CS (three-component heterologous prime-boost). A comparator group of mice received a prime with adjuvanted CS protein followed by an Ad35.CS boost. At two weeks post the final boost immunization, mice receiving the three-component heterologous prime-boost regimen showed a significantly higher levels of CS-specific IFNy-producing CD8+ T-cells compared to the mice receiving the CS protein prime and Ad35.CS boost regimen (Figure 3Α; Ρ > 0.05 comparing CS-specific IFNy-producing CD8+ T-cell levels with ANOVA). At eight weeks post the final boost immunization, the IFNy+ CD8+ T-cell response induced by the three-component prime-boost regimen was still significantly higher compared to the CS protein/Ad35.CS regimen (Fig. 3Β; Ρ > 0.05 comparing CS-specific IFNy-producing CD8+ T-cell levels with ANOVA). Importantly, at both time points the levels of CS-specific IgG responses induced by the three-component prime-boost regimen were comparable to that seen for the CS protein/Ad35.CS regimen (Fig. 3Β and D; Ρ > 0.05 comparing CS-specific IgG levels with ANOVA). The IgG2a/IgGl ratio of CS-specific antibodies induced with the CS protein/Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS vaccine regimen was comparable to the ratio induced with the CS protein/Ad35.CS immunization (data not shown). Cytokine profile induced by the different vaccination regimens The total number of CS-specific CD4+ Τ cells expressing two or more immune markers, being Thl cytokines IFNy, TNFa, IL2, and activation marker CD40L, induced upon immunization with RTS,S, has been associated with protection to malaria infection in the human challenge model (Kester et al, 2009). We investigated cytokine profile breadth induced in CS-specific Τ cells with three component malaria vaccine, CS protein/Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS, and compared it to the cytokine profiles induced with CS-protein/CS protein or CS protein/Ad35.CS regimen. Two weeks after the final boost immunization, expression levels of the Thl (IFNy, TNFa, IL-2), Th2 (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10) and Thl7 (EL-17) cytokines were determined using the cytometric bead array (CBA) assay upon 48 hrs in vitro stimulation of splenocytes with the CS protein. The CBA assay with protein stimulation provides a blueprint of the type of Τ helper cells that have been induced with the vaccination regiment. All vaccination regimens, except for the sham, induced the tested cytokines, with an exception of IL-4 which was not detected (data not shown) (Fig. 4). The CS protein/Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS regimen induced significantly higher levels of IFNy and TNFa compared to either the CS protein or the CS protein/Ad35.CS regimen (Fig. 4; Ρ < 0.05 comparing cytokine levels with ANOVA). The levels of other cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and IL17) were comparable for all immunization regimens (Fig. 4;P> 0.05 comparing cytokine levels with ANOVA). Summarizing, these data confirm that a prime-boost regimen comprising of the three components, CS protein, Ad35.CS and Ad26.CS, results in a robust and broad Thl type immune response. DISCUSSION Immunizations with a CS protein vaccine elicit potent antibody responses, but poor cellular responses. In this study we demonstrated that vaccination with the CS protein followed by Ad35.CS vector in a heterologous prime-boost regimen results in enhancement of IFNy+ CD8+ T-cell responses. The boosting with Ad35.CS did not hamper the level of CS-specific humoral response induced with the protein vaccination, but shifted the Ig isotypes towards a Thl type of response. In addition, we established that a heterologous prime-boost regimen comprising a CS protein prime followed by boosts with Ad35.CS and Ad26.CS elicits strong CS-specific Thl type responses, with a durable enhancement of the IFNy+ CD8+ T-cells and potent antibody responses. Adenoviral vectors are known to induce high levels of antigen-specific IFN-y+ CD8+ Τ cells. The combination of adenovectors with other vaccine types has proven highly efficient in eliciting strong and sustainable T-cell immunity as well as humoral responses. Indeed within the current study we show that the priming with an adjuvanted yeast-produced CS protein followed by the Ad35.CS boost results in the induction of higher CS-specific IFN-y+ CD8+ T-cell responses compared to exclusively protein-based vaccine regimen. Importantly, while the overall CS-specific IgG levels were not affected compared to the responses induced with an entirely CS protein vaccination regimen, the CS protein/Ad35.CS regimen elicited a more Thl type response. These results corroborated earlier findings in which prime-boost regimens comprised of Ad35 vaccine vectors expressing CS or LSA-1, and RTS,S or a LSA-1 protein vaccine resulted in potent Thl type T-cell responses and high level humoral responses (Rodriguez et al, 2008; Stewart et al, 2007). Previously we reported on the heterologous prime-boost regimen utilizing the Ad35.CS and Ad5.CS vaccine vectors that elicited high levels of CS-specific 1ΡΝ-γ producing Τ cells in both mice and non-human primates (Rodriguez et al, 2009). These results demonstrated the potential of adenovector-based heterologous prime-boost regimens to induce the type of immunity required to combat malaria. Given the wide diversity of adenoviruses in nature many different serotypes are potentially available. In our study, the inclusion of the Ad26.CS boost to the CS protein/ Ad3 5. CS prime-boost regimen elicited an overall higher and more sustainable CS-specific IF Νγ l CD8+ immune response as compared to the homologous or the 2-component heterologous prime-boost regimens. The recent association of Thl cytokine expressing CD4+ Τ cells, induced with RTS,S vaccine, with protection against malaria infection in the human challenge model has reinforced the view that induction of a broad immune response of Thl type is required for development of efficient malaria vaccines (Kester et al, 2009). Induction of balanced pro-inflammatory and regulatory immune responses is also a key factor determining the outcome of malaria infection. Failure to develop an effective pro-inflammatory response might result in unrestricted parasite replication, whereas failure to control this response can lead to the development of severe immunopathology. Boosting of the CS protein vaccine with the Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS combination strongly enhanced the levels of Thl cytokines IFNy and TNFa, while the levels of Thl cytokine IL-2, Th2 cytokines IL-6 and 1L-10 and Thl7 cytokine IL-17 were comparable to the levels induced with the CS protein vaccine alone. This result indicated the capacity of the three-component regimen to stimulate an overall balanced cytokine response, with a strong shift towards the Thl responses as compared to the homologous CS protein regimen inducing primarily a Th2 biased response. While the role for Thl type response in protection against malaria has been well documented, to our knowledge there are no reports concerning the role of Thl7 cells in malaria infection. However, there is mounting evidence that IL-17 might be relevant for protection against parasitic infections and other pathogens. In the current study, albeit no significant difference was observed in the mean level of the IL-17 cytokines between different groups, the adenovector containing regimens induced more uniform IL-17 responses as compared to the protein immunization. The limited and short lived protection induced with the CS protein vaccine can be strongly improved as demonstrated in the current study, by administering the Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS combination as a booster vaccine (in second year of life or even at school age) following an early-in-life protein CS vaccine, to induce long lasting protection for which the Thl type response and immune memory is required. A further study in non-human primates evaluates the prime-boost regimen combining the CS protein vaccine, Ad35.CS and Ad26.CS. The study comprises three experimental groups of 5 animals each. One group receives a prime with the CS protein followed by a first boost with Ad35.CS and a second boost with Ad26.CS. Another group receives a prime with Ad35.CS followed by a first boost with Ad26.CS and a second boost with the CS protein. A third group receives a prime with Ad35.CS followed by first boost with Ad35.CS and a second boost with Ad26.CS. The vaccination schedule involves intramuscular administration of the vaccines at 0-4-8 weeks. Methods for measuring antigen-specific cellular immune responses such as CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses comprises ELISPOT, ICS, and multiplex cytokine assays. Methods for measuring antigen-specific humoral responses include ELISA. Example 2: Study in non-human primates The tolerability and immunogenicity of the three-component prime-boost was evaluated in non-human primates. For this purpose rhesus macaques (15 animals in total) were selected from an available animal pool based on following criteria: (i) physical exam demonstrating a good health, (ii) no prior exposure to malaria and malaria antigens (no background in CS-specific ELISA and ELISPOT assays ), and (iii) no detectable neutralizing antibodies against Ad35 or Ad26 in serum. Selected animals were stratified over 3 experimental treatment groups, 5 animals each, on the basis of body weight, age and gender. Eventually, all 3 treatment groups contained 2 male and 3 female individuals each. Animals were socially housed throughout the study. Animals were vaccinated at week 0, 4 and 8 by intramuscular injection under sedation with adjuvant-formulated or rAd-vectored circumsporozoite (CS) protein from Ρ. falciparum (Pf). CS protein was formulated in Matrix Μ adjuvant from Isconova (Uppsala). Vaccine injections were given contralaterally in the left and right upper arm (triceps) and the upper leg (quadriceps), respectively. The immunization schedules including dose are listed in Table 1.

Briefly, blood samples were drawn, by venipuncture under sedation for Collection of PBMC and serum samples and cryo storage. Humoral immunity was measured by CS-specific ELISA using recombinant CS protein and a CS specific peptide (NANP)6C (rCS, CS.p). Cellular immunity was measured by IFNy-specific ELISPOT (SPOT), upon stimulation of frozen PBMCs with recombinant CS protein and CS specific pool of peptides. Finally, the anti-vector responses were evaluated using neutralization assays specific for Ad35 and Ad26. RESULTS Local adverse effects Animals were observed as a daily routine of animal care and at sedation time points the injection sites were specifically inspected. Around the vaccination time points no abnormalities at the site of injection were observed, neither upon primary, secondary or tertiary vaccination by intramuscular injection of either of the adjuvanted CS protein or the Ad35.CS or Ad26.CS vaccine candidates. CS-specific response CS-specific IgG responses were measured by ELISA using serial dilutions of sera to determine the samples endpoint titers, which were defined as the lowest titer at which signals were exceeding 2χ saline control values. As a positive control, a titration range of a positive serum pool from naturally exposed individuals from an endemic region was used (ctrl serum). Endpoint titers in time and per treatment group are depicted in Fig. 5 (data are depicted in a linear as well as a 2log scale on the left and the right, respectively). Upon primary vaccination, the Ad35.CS and the CS protein induced similar CS-specific IgG levels. Upon secondary vaccination, animals primed with the CS-protein and boosted with Ad35.CS showed the highest levels of CS-specific antibody responses, as compared to animals receiving an Ad35.CS prime and boosted with either Ad35.CS or the Ad26.CS. Upon tertiary vaccination the three component vaccination regimens (CS protein/Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS and Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS/CS protein) showed comparable CS-specific antibody levels, which were somewhat higher than the levels shown by the Ad35.CS/Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS. However, towards week 20 of the study the CS-specifc antibody response induced by all vaccination regimens were comparable, suggesting no major impact on the longevity of specific humoral immunity by either of these vaccination regimes. The CS-specific cellular responses induced by the vaccination regimens were measured using IFN-y ELISPOT and are depicted in Fig. 6. All vaccination regimens showed high CS-specific ΠΤΜ-γ cellular responses upon stimulation with CS peptide pool and CS protein. The numbers of IFN-y spot forming units were higher upon stimulation with the CS peptide pool stimulation as compared to the CS protein stimulation, suggesting the activation of different cell types. Interestingly, upon stimulation with CS peptide pool the Ad35.CS/Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS regimen showed the highest IFN-y response whereas upon stimulation with CS protein the CS protein/Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS regimen showed the best results. Adenovector-specifc response The evaluation of the vector-specific responses was performed using neutralization assays specific for Ad35 and Ad26. The levels of neutralizing antibodies against Ad35 and Ad26 vectors are depicted in Fig. 7. Data showed that all animals immunized with the adenovectors elicited Ad35- and ad26- neutralizing antibodies. Low titers of Ad35 neutralizing antibodies are induced upon a single vaccination with Ad35.CS, indicating the feasibility of a second vaccination with the same vector. Upon the second Ad35 .CS vaccination the levels of neutralizing antibodies increased significantly. The levels of neutralizing antibodies against Ad26 were higher than the levels seen for Ad35. In conclusion, the non-human primate study confirmed our earlier data in mice showing that a three-components heterologous prime-boost including adjuvanted CS protein/Ad35.CS/Ad26.CS, is a highly efficient regimen inducing antibody and T-cell responses that are required for protection against malaria.
