RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 USC 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/832,863 filed Jun. 9, 2013, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to an apparatus and method for detecting myocardial ischemia using analysis of high frequency components of an electrocardiogram and/or of a cardiac electrogram, and, more particularly, but not exclusively, to an implantable such apparatus and method. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to measure rate and regularity of heartbeats, as well as a size and position of heart chambers, presence of damage to the heart, and effects of drugs or devices used to regulate the heart. Usually two or more electrodes are used for electrocardiogram (ECG) measurement. The electrodes can be combined into a number of pairs. Output from a pair of electrodes is known as a lead. An ECG is a common way to measure and diagnose abnormalities in electrical activity of the cardiac muscle and abnormal rhythms of the heart, particularly abnormalities caused by damage to conductive tissue that carries electrical signals, or abnormal rhythms caused by electrolyte imbalances. In a condition of myocardial infarction (MI), the ECG can identify if the heart muscle has been damaged and sometime also indicate the location of damage, though not all areas of the heart are covered. A typical ECG device detects and amplifies tiny electrical changes on a subject's skin which are caused when a heart muscle depolarizes and subsequently repolarizes during each heartbeat. At rest, each cardiac muscle cell is negatively charged, causing a membrane potential across its cell membrane. A cell's activation phase commences with depolarization, initiated by an influx of positive cations, Na+ and Ca++, and decreasing the absolute value of the negative charge towards zero. The depolarization activates mechanical mechanisms in the cardiac muscle cell which causes contraction in the cardiac muscle. During each heart cycle, a healthy heart has an orderly progression as a wave of depolarisation which is triggered by cells in the sinoatrial node spreads out through the atrium, then passes through the atrioventricular node and finally spreads over the ventricles. The progression is detected as waveforms in the recorded potential difference (or voltage) between electrodes placed on either side of the heart and may be displayed as a graph either on screen or on paper. The produced signal reflects the electrical activity of the heart, and different leads express more clearly different parts of the heart muscle. A typical ECG trace of the cardiac cycle (heartbeat) consists of a P wave, a QRS complex, a T wave, and a U wave which is normally visible in 50% to 75% of ECG traces. A baseline voltage of the electrocardiogram is known as the isoelectric line. Typically, the isoelectric line is measured as the portion of the ECG trace following the T wave and preceding the next P wave. A standard ECG traces usually filters out high frequency (HF) components, typically above 100 Hz. In some commercial implementations, lower thresholds such as 75 Hz or even 50 Hz are used for the low-pass filtering process. In general, the noise level is such that high frequency components, above 150 Hz, which are typically measured in micro-volts, are not reliably isolated from a single ECG trace and identified or measured. In order to measure and process high frequency components, one typically needs to use signal-to-noise enhancement schemes such as filtering and averaging. An article by George B. Moody, Roger G. Mark, Andrea Zoccola and Sara Mantero titled “Derivation of Respiratory Signals from Multi-lead ECGs”, published in Computers in Cardiology 1985, vol. 12, pp. 113-116, Washington, D.C.: IEEE Computer Society Press, describes a signal-processing technique which derives respiratory waveforms from ordinary ECGs, permitting detection of respiratory efforts.

DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to an apparatus and method for detecting myocardial ischemia using analysis of high frequency components of an electrocardiogram and/or of a cardiac electrogram, and, more particularly, but not exclusively, to an implantable such apparatus and method. A broad aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to measuring a HF (high frequency) electrogram from inside the body, for example, using electrodes which are also used for IPGs (implantable pulse generators), for example, for a pacemaker, a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and/or a defibrillator or cardioverter, or other active implantable devices like neurostimulators. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates using a significant amount of collected data to reduce noise and/or increase sensitivity of HF electrogram measurements. In typical, out of body HF electrogram measurements, the signal is often noisy and it is difficult to measure long periods while the heart is stressed (e.g., in a stress test). In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, use is made of an implantable measurement device to provide a high quality intracardiac electrogram signal, providing a significant amount of data, potentially over a period of hours, days, weeks, months, even years. The signal is collected on a routine basis and HF electrogram values are measured for recording of long term values that sometimes serve as a baseline for clinical diagnosis and long term status of the subject and short term values that provide an indication on a current transient status. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the data is used to provide a reliable baseline. Optionally or alternatively, the data is used to provide a baseline for multiple categories, for example, different baselines for different values of physiologically related and/or measured parameters (e.g., one or more of movement, blood pressure, time of day, ischemia, eating, sleeping), ECG morphologies, breathing cycle portions and/or types, pacing activity and/or parameters, heart rate. Optionally or alternatively, the data is used to analyze simultaneously two or more HF electrogram parameters, such as amplitude and morphology, potentially providing a more robust analysis of the subject's condition. In some embodiments, a result of the analysis of the electrogram signal is optionally stored. In some embodiments, the analysis and/or the storing include compression of the result of the analysis. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to changing behavior of an IPG based on results of the analysis. In some embodiments, the IPG changes pulse generation timing based on the results of the analysis. In some embodiments, a CRT changes output based on the results of the analysis. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to synchronizing the acquisition and/or analysis of HF electrogram signals to a breathing parameter. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, it is noted that the breathing cycle has an effect on the autonomous nervous system and on various actions and reactions of the heart. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, measurement comprises binning measurements according to a breath cycle. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to synchronizing data acquisition and/or analysis activities to particular parts of the cardiac cycle and/or local electrical activity. Optionally, an acquisition window is defined, for example, based on an estimated time when a signal of interest is expected (e.g., based on a pacing signal or an analysis of a previous signal) and/or based on a trigger signal (e.g., a local sensing of electrical activity at the measurement location or remote therefrom). In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, only data acquired in the window is analyzed and/or acquired at high frequency. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the measured HF electrogram signal is not of an entire QRS complex, rather the measurement reflects a segment of the QRS. In some cases this segment relates to the location of the implantable electrode location. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the portion of the cardiac cycle with is acquired and/or analyzed is less than 50%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5% or intermediate percentages of the time. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, selective data acquisition is applied in conjunction with such synchronizing, for example, acquiring and/or analyzing HF electrogram signals only if both timing and one or more other criteria are met. For example, acquisition may depend on both breathing cycle and time in cardiac cycle. For example, acquisition may be performed during similar physiological conditions such as similar pulse rate, during a subject's sleep, etc. by way of a non-limiting example, sleeping is optionally detected by measuring heart rate and/or heart rate variability. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to measuring local HF electrogram signals, for example, between two electrodes that are at or near the heart, rather than between an electrode in the heart and an electrode far from the heart. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, this allows an HF electrogram signal to be mostly of a small part of the heart (e.g., less than 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10% or intermediate percentages of a muscle mass volume thereof). In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the measurement is using bipolar electrodes (or other multiple electrodes on a same lead) which measure HF electrogram contributions from nearby tissue, for example, to within a distance of less than 5 cm, 3 cm, 2 cm, 1 cm or intermediate distances. Optionally or alternatively, the measurement is using separate electrodes, for example, one atrial electrode and one ventricular electrode, and the measured tissue lies between the pair of electrodes. In some embodiments more than two electrodes are used. In some embodiments two or more electrodes are used and their signals optionally combined, optionally averaging the signals provided by both. In some embodiments, the HF electrogram is optionally picked up and/or measured and/or analyzed excluding times when a pacing signal is provided by a pacing unit. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, at least one electrode is placed so that a significant part of the heart can be assessed, for example, at least 30%, 50%, 60% or intermediate parts of the heart. Optionally, such measurement is between an intra-cardiac electrode or an electrode adjacent the heart and the can of an IPG or a remote electrode or an electrode at another side of the heart. It is noted that measuring a signal between electrodes placed at different locations potentially enables measuring the difference in tissue between a source of an electric signal (natural or artificial pacing) and the electrode location. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to identifying local ischemia by comparing a first measurement and a second measurement which are separated in time and/or space. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the criticality of a stenosis or other vascular flow abnormality is determined by measuring HF electrogram components upstream and downstream (or within) the abnormality. It is expected that significant (e.g., should be treated) abnormalities will show a significant difference in ischemia between the upstream and downstream locations. A non-limiting example difference may optionally be a change in HF RMS values greater than 2%, 5%, 10% or 20%, 30%, 40% or 50%. In another example, ischemia levels at difference localities are measured using pairs of electrodes as described above. Optionally, this comparison is used to assess progress of treatment and/or disease and/or to determine changes in ischemia in different parts of the heart as a function of condition (e.g., physiological state, stress, sleep). In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the comparison is over time, by comparing the degree of ischemia under different conditions. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, electrode placement is selected to ensure the ability to measure desired localities and/or compare such localities. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to electrogram signals gathered from implanted electrodes being stronger than electrogram signals gathered from electrodes attached to a subject's skin. In some embodiments, the implanted electrodes are optionally connected, directly or wirelessly, to an analyzer external to a subject's body. In some embodiments, the implanted electrodes are optionally connected to an analyzer also implanted in the subject's body. In some embodiments, at least one electrode, or at least a reference potential, is measured at the implanted analyzer body, also termed a can. In some embodiments, the implanted electrodes are optionally connected to a IPG, optionally a pacemaker with processing capabilities, and the analyzer is included in the IPG can. In some embodiments the analyzer includes adding components to a pacemaker, in some embodiments the analyzer includes software which runs on a pacemaker processor. In some embodiments, the same electrodes used for measuring the electrogram or for providing a pacing signal by the pacemaker, CRT, ICD or any other implantable device are optionally used to pick up the electrogram. In some embodiments, the electrogram signal is not picked up while a pacing signal is provided by the pacemaker. Since the pacing signal is short, typically on the order of one millisecond, once per heartbeat, the same electrodes used for pacing can optionally be used to pick up the electrogram during the rest of the time. In some embodiments, the electrogram signal is not picked up for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 or even 50 milliseconds following a pacing signal by the pacemaker. In some embodiments, a QRS signal triggered by pacing is not picked up. In some embodiment, the smart pacemaker provides a signal to an electrogram pickup unit, and the electrogram pickup unit is thus notified when a QRS signal is triggered by pacing. Modern pacemakers do not provide pacing signals all the time, only responsive to a subject's heart rate and/or heart condition. In such pacemakers the same electrodes used for pacing are optionally used to pick up the electrogram, since the electrodes are not being used to provide pacing signals during most of the time. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to the stronger electrogram signals being synergistically conducive to analyzing high frequency (HF) electrogram signals, which are weak when gathered from electrodes attached to a subject's skin. Potentially, various known techniques such as described in the references listed in the Background section, are able to be carried out with less interfering noise, potentially at higher quality, potentially at higher signal to noise (SNR) ratio, potentially over shorter measurement durations. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to alignment of the electrogram signals. In some embodiments alignment of electrogram signals from different heart beats is optionally performed by correlation of low frequency components of the electrogram signals, and/or by correlation of high frequency components of the electrogram signals, and/or by using a pacemaker pulse, and/or by detecting atrial depolarization by using an atrial electrode. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to saving power in an implanted device by gathering electrogram signals only during a specific fraction of time, potentially lengthening duration of operation between possible battery charging. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to saving power in an implanted device by gathering electrogram signals only during a specific fraction of the cardiac cycle. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to saving power in an implanted device by gathering electrogram signals only during a specific fraction of the QRS cardiac cycle segment. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to saving power in an implanted device by gathering electrogram signals only during a specific fraction of a breathing cycle, potentially comparing like signals to like signals, since some features of an electrogram signal typically correlate to the breathing cycle, and potentially lengthening duration of operation between possible battery charging. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to measuring the HF electrogram when the heart rate is within a specific range of heart rates. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to electrogram signals gathered from implanted electrodes enabling placing the electrodes at locations physiologically different than only electrodes attached to a subject's skin. An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to analyzing high frequency (HF) electrogram signals which are picked up proximally and distally to an occlusion in a blood vessel. Comparing the above-mentioned signals potentially indicates a change in tissue before and after the occlusion, and/or a degree of the occlusion. In some embodiments, the comparison of the HF electrogram signals may optionally be performed in a same procedure as performing a fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement, and results of both measurements may be combined to indicate degree of the occlusion and/or suggest a method of treatment of the occlusion. For purposes of better understanding some embodiments of the present invention, reference is first made to FIG. 1A, which is a simplified illustration of a prior art apparatus for detecting myocardial ischemia using analysis of high frequency components of an electrocardiogram. FIG. 1A depicts a thorax 105, with electrodes 107 attached to the thorax 105 and to a device 109 for analysis of high frequency components of an electrocardiogram. Reference is also made to FIG. 1B, which is a simplified illustration of typical prior art locations for attaching pickup electrodes, including electrodes for picking up high frequency components of an electrocardiogram. FIG. 1B depicts three line figures 151152153 of human subjects, and three sets of locations 155156157 for placing electrodes for picking up high frequency components of an electrocardiogram. Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not necessarily limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components and/or methods set forth in the following description and/or illustrated in the drawings and/or the Examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Reference is now made to FIG. 2A, which is a simplified illustration of apparatus for analyzing an electrogram according to an example embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2A shows a schematic depiction of a chest 202, with an implanted electronics box, also termed an implantable device 204 also termed a can, and with one or more electrodes electrically connecting the device 204 with one or more electrogram signal pickup locations. Example pickup locations depicted in FIG. 2A include the right atrium 222, the right ventricle 224, the left atrium 230, and the left ventricle 226. The electrogram signal pickup locations may optionally be located on a surface of the heart at epicardial locations. The electrogram signal pickup locations may optionally also be located in coronary veins and arteries such as the coronary sinus. The electrogram signal pickup locations may also be at some other place in a subject's thorax 228. FIG. 2A also depicts a schematic drawing of a heart 220. The example embodiment of FIG. 2A depicts a first electrode location optionally located at the right atrium 222; a second electrode location optionally located at the right ventricle 224; a third electrode location optionally located at the left ventricle 226; and a fourth electrode location optionally located elsewhere in the thorax 228. The left atrium 230 of the heart is shown without an electrode in the present example embodiment. It is noted that the device 204 is depicted as a schematic block, not necessarily depicted at the best location for the implantation. In some embodiments the device 204 can is at least partially conductive and may optionally serve as an additional electrogram signal pickup location. It is noted that some embodiments may optionally include an electrode located at the left atrium 230. In some embodiments there may optionally be an electrode located at the left atrium 230 for use in pacing, optionally without using the electrode for electrogram pickup. Example Electrode Locations In some example embodiments the electrogram signal is measured between two electrodes which are placed both in the same heart chamber. In some example embodiments the electrogram signal is measured between an electrode which is placed in a heart chamber and an electrode which is placed outside the heart chamber. In some example embodiments the electrogram signal is measured between an electrode which is placed in a first heart chamber and an electrode which is placed in a second heart chamber. In some example embodiments the electrogram signal is measured between an electrode which is placed touching a heart an electrode which is electrically coupled to a device can. In some example embodiments the electrogram signal is optionally measured between two locations adjacent to a heart, the two locations having at least 50% of the mass of the heart between them. In some example embodiments the electrogram signal is measured between an intracardiac electrode and an epicardiac electrode. Reference is now additionally made to FIG. 2B, which is a simplified illustration of some non-limiting example potential differences measured by the example embodiment of FIG. 2A. FIG. 2B depicts the schematic depiction of the chest 202, the device 204, the electrogram signal pickup locations 222224226228230, and the schematic depiction of the heart 220, as also shown in FIG. 2A. FIG. 2B demonstrates some non-limiting examples of potential differences 251-257 measured between the electrogram signal pickup locations 222224226228. The examples of potential differences 251-257 are a partial example of pairing of the locations 222224226228230. In some examples, where bipolar electrodes are used, an electrogram signal may also optionally be measured between two poles on the same general location 222224226228230. In some embodiments the system optionally performs simultaneous measurement of several electrogram signals from several pairs of electrodes, providing measurement of several electrogram vectors and/or indexes. Reference is now additionally made to FIG. 2C, which is a simplified illustration of apparatus for analyzing an electrogram according to another example embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2C shows a schematic depiction of a chest 202, with an implantable device 235, also termed a can, and with one monopole electrode electrically connecting the device 235 with an electrogram signal pickup location 226, optionally in the coronary sinus at a location in proximity to the left ventricle. FIG. 2C also depicts a schematic depiction of the heart 220. The electrode location may optionally be on a surface of the heart 220, optionally using an epicardial electrode, optionally attached and/or sutured to the surface of the heart 220. It is noted that there are optionally many alternative configurations of measuring potential differences for producing an electrogram. The configurations include, by way of some non-limiting examples: a monopole electrode and the can; a bipolar electrode at each one of several heart locations (for example as shown in FIG. 1A); between any 2 electrode positions in the heart, e.g. intracardiac, epicardiac (on the heart), in coronary blood vessels. By way of a noon-limiting example—between the right atrium and the left ventricle; between an electrode in the heart and an electrode in the thorax (for example as shown in FIG. 1A); between two locations in the thorax (not shown); and between locations some of which are positioned at a cardiac blood vessel. In some embodiments a bipolar electrode may optionally serve to measure a potential difference between two poles of the bipolar electrode. In some embodiments a monopolar electrode may optionally serve to measure a potential difference between the monopolar electrode and the device can, and/or relative to a different electrode, whether the different electrode is another monopolar electrode or a bipolar electrode. In various embodiments electrogram vectors are optionally produced from the potential differences measured. In various embodiments HF indexes, for example such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,626,275, are optionally calculated for some or all of the electrogram vectors. In some embodiments at least the following HF indexes are optionally used: an RMS of the HF electrogram; an amplitude of the HF electrogram; and a morphology of the HF electrogram. Reference is now made to FIG. 2D, which is a simplified illustration of apparatus for analyzing an electrogram according to yet another example embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2D shows a schematic depiction of a chest 240, with a device 242, also termed a can, external to the chest 240, and with one or more electrodes 244 electrically connecting the device 242 with one or more electrogram signal pickup locations located within the subject's body (not shown). FIG. 2D depicts an example embodiment in which the device 242 is external to the subject's body, while the electrodes 244 extend to one or more electrogram signal pickup locations located within the subject's body (not shown). In some embodiments the device 242 is not necessarily attached to the subject's body. In some embodiments electrodes (not shown) are entirely implanted with the subject's body, and a device (not shown) inside the subject's body sends wireless signals to a receiver (not shown) outside the subject's body. Reference is now made to FIG. 2E, which is a simplified illustration of apparatus for detecting myocardial ischemia using analysis of high frequency components of an electrogram according to still another example embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2E shows a schematic depiction of an implantable device 260, which includes an HF electrogram analyzer 262 and a pacemaker 264. In FIG. 2E the HF electrogram analyzer 262 optionally shares one or more electrodes 266 with the pacemaker 264. The analyzer 262 is optionally connected 263 to the same electrodes 266 to which the pacemaker 264 is also connected 265. FIG. 2E depicts an example embodiment in which the analyzer 262 shares the can 260 with a pacemaker 264, and also shares the electrodes 266. In some embodiments, the analyzer 262 is optionally connected 268 to a body of the can 260. In some embodiments, the analyzer 262 optionally communicates with the pacemaker 264, for example in order to receive a signal when the pacemaker 264 sends a pacing signal. Reference is now made to FIG. 2F, which is a simplified illustration of apparatus for detecting myocardial ischemia using analysis of high frequency components of an electrogram according to yet another example embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2F shows a schematic depiction of an implantable device 270, which an HF electrogram analyzer 272 shares with a pacemaker 274. In FIG. 2F the HF electrogram analyzer 272 is connected 273 one or more electrodes 279 not shared with the pacemaker 274, and the pacemaker is connected 275 to one or more electrodes 276 not shared with the analyzer 272. FIG. 2F depicts an example embodiment in which the analyzer 272 shares the implantable device 270 with the pacemaker 274, and does not also share the electrodes. In some embodiments, the analyzer 272 is optionally connected 278 to a body of the can 270. In some embodiments, the analyzer 272 optionally communicates with the pacemaker 274, for example in order to receive a signal when the pacemaker 274 sends a pacing signal. The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to quantification of high frequency signals of the electrogram within a setting of an implantable device, and/or intracardiac electrodes and/or intracoronary electrodes. The term endocardiac electrode refers to electrodes which are placed in the heart and typically used for mapping, and the term intracardiac electrodes refers more to single lead electrodes for pacing and/or sensing. The term epicardial electrode refers to electrodes which are placed on a heart, beneath the pericardium. In various embodiments, endocardiac electrode(s), and/or intracardiac electrode(s) and/or epicardial electrode(s) are used. In various embodiments, monopolar electrodes and/or bipolar electrodes and/or multipolar electrodes or a mix thereof are used. In some embodiments the implantable device has an independent sensing and analysis device, even if contained within a can of a pacemaker. In some embodiments the implantable device transmits signals by wireless transmission to a receiver located outside a body of a subject in which the device is implanted. In some embodiments the transmitted signal includes raw data. In some embodiments the transmitted signal includes results of an analysis and/or an alert signal. In some embodiments the implantable device transmits signals by a wired connection to a receiver located outside a body of a subject in which the device is implanted. In some embodiments the alert is an alert sent to a human and/or to a computer circuit and/or program and/or receiver. In some embodiments the implantable device is used in conjunction with other implantable devices such as a pacemaker, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), a neural stimulator, an implantable pump, a stent, artificial valves, or a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device. In some embodiments the implantable device shares a can and/or electrodes with the above-mentioned implantable devices. In some embodiments the implanted device optionally uses implantable electrodes for sensing an electrogram. Such electrodes are optionally placed on a surface of the device (which is implanted inside the subject's body, optionally close to the heart), and/or removably attached to the device and placed in proximity of a heart in intracardiac or/and endocardial and/or intracoronary positions. In some embodiments the device optionally measures an electrogram signal between 2 electrodes and/or between several pairings of electrodes. In some embodiments the device optionally measures an electrogram signal between an electrode and a location on a can of the implantable device—optionally on a surface of the implantable device. In some embodiments, high frequency analysis of the QRS segment of the electrogram is optionally used for detecting myocardial ischemia. The high frequency analysis optionally calculates one or more parameters based on the high frequency electrogram signal. In some embodiments, detecting ischemia, or calculating a parameter based on the high frequency electrogram signal which can potentially indicate ischemia, optionally causes sending an alert to a pacemaker. In some embodiments, detecting ischemia, or calculating a parameter based on the high frequency electrogram signal which can potentially indicate ischemia, occurs inside an implantable device such as a pacemaker or other implantable device. In some embodiments, ischemia is differentiated from angina, and a different alert is optionally produced for each, based on analysis of a low frequency electrogram parameter such as heart rate variability. Heart rate variability is typically lower in an angina condition, and when an alert is optionally produced, the alert may optionally include an indication of ischemia or angina. In some embodiments, a P-wave interval is evaluated for detection of atrial fibrillation onset and/or for indication of potential future onset of atrial fibrillation. In some embodiments the following parameters are calculated based on the high frequency electrogram signal and high frequency ECG analysis: an RMS of the high frequency signal, which typically decreases during ischemia;detection and quantification of a reduced amplitude zone (RAZ) in the high frequency signal. The high frequency electrogram is optionally measured in various configurations allowing for the analysis of electrical activity in multiple vectors according to the location of the electrodes relative to the device's can and/or between pairs of electrodes and/or combinations of electrodes. Locations for the Implantable Device The implantable device for the electronics for performing at least the pickup of the HF signals, as well as optionally the pickup of regular-frequency ECG signals, in different embodiments, may be found as: an implanted device, by way of a non-limiting example such as depicted in FIGS. 2A, 2B and 2C; an external device, by way of a non-limiting example such as depicted in FIG. 2D. In some embodiments an implanted device is optionally included in a pacemaker can, optionally a smart pacemaker. In some embodiments an implanted can is optionally a can implanted separately from an existing pacemaker, if any. In some embodiments the can optionally serves for HF electrogram signal pickup, and transfers the signals to an external analysis unit. In some embodiments the transfer of the signals is optionally performed wirelessly. In some embodiments the transfer of the signals is optionally performed by wire. Internal/External Electrodes In some embodiments the pickup electrodes are implanted electrodes common with pacemaker electrodes. In some embodiments the pickup electrodes are implanted electrodes separate from pacemaker electrodes. In some embodiments the pickup electrodes are inserted into a subject's body via a catheter, and optionally used while the catheter is inside the subject's body, without being implanted. Electrode Locations In various embodiments the pickups are located in various locations, such as, by way of some non-limiting examples: a right atrium (RA); a right ventricle (RV); a left ventricle (LV); a coronary sinus (CS); an epicardial location; and an electrode located in the chest. Internal/External Analysis In some embodiments analysis of the HF electrogram signals is performed within an implanted can. In some embodiments analysis of the HF electrogram signals is performed externally of a subject's body. During Angiogram/Angio-Stent In some embodiments monitoring and/or analysis of the HF electrogram signals is performed during a procedure in which electrodes are inserted into a subject's body, such as, by way of a non-limiting example, during an angiogram, with electrodes inserted via catheter. Detecting the QRS Interval In some embodiments, a temporal location of the QRS interval is optionally detected by analyzing a signal from an electrode in the right atrium. A natural heart pacing starts at the right atrium. In some embodiments detecting onset of a pulse optionally provides an indication when to start recording at a HF sampling rate. In some embodiments HF sampling is optionally synchronized with a pacemaker pacing pulse. In some embodiments an estimation is made as to when a next QRS signal is expected based on timing and rate of previous heart beats. HF Sampling in a Sub-Portion of the Cardiac Cycle The terms cardiac cycle portion, cardiac cycle sub-portion and cardiac cycle segment are used interchangeably in the specification and claims. In some embodiments, especially implantable embodiments, power and current consumption may impose constraints on the device and/or method of detection and monitoring of myocardial ischemia. In such embodiments it is preferable to save in power consumption of the device. In some embodiments, to facilitate the saving, a specific mode of the device is optionally configured to sample the electrogram at a high sampling rate, e.g. 1000 samples per second, only during specific portions of the signal or of the cardiac cycle, e.g. during and around the QRS interval. At other times, which typically constitute more than 50% of the cardiac cycle, the signal may be sampled at a lower frequency, for example, fewer than 150 samples per second. In some embodiments, the sampling rate is lowered even further, and/or suspended altogether. In some embodiments the device is optionally configured to perform HF sampling only during, by way of some non-limiting example: the QRS interval; the P wave interval; the T wave interval; the Q wave interval: the R wave interval: and the S wave interval. In some embodiments, a beginning and/or and end of the segment of the cardiac cycle is defined to start and/or end based, by way of some non-limiting examples, on one or more of: detection of a specific point in a cardiac cycle, optionally using analysis of the HF electrogram and/or a low frequency ECG; a timing offset from a trigger such as the above specific point, for example a P wave maximum plus 10 milliseconds; and a timing offset from a trigger such as a pacing signal, for example a P wave maximum plus 10 milliseconds. Generally, high frequency signals are sampled in a range of frequencies between 100 and 1000 Hz, and normal ECG sampling rates between 1 to 100 Hz. In some embodiments analysis of the signal samples is optionally performed at a rate between 100 and 300 Hz, with signals sampled at a rate of 1000 Hz or more. In some embodiments an intracardiac electrogram is measured during a QRS interval with a high sampling rate, and during a rest of the cardiac cycle using low sampling rate. Some non-limiting example include a high sampling rate greater than 250 samples per second, and even greater than 500 samples per second. Some non-limiting example include a low sampling rate greater than 150 samples per second, lower than 100 samples per second, and even lower than 60 samples per second. In some embodiments detecting the QRS interval is performed by detecting the QRS interval in a low frequency electrogram, that is, detecting the QRS interval in a regular ECG. In some embodiments detecting the QRS interval is performed by detecting the QRS interval by analyzing a high frequency electrogram. Cleaning Up the HF Signal The high frequency signal used for detecting myocardial ischemia may be relatively low in amplitude, even for intracardiac signals. In some embodiments the HF signal is optionally aligned and averaged over several QRS intervals which are close in time. Such an averaging procedure potentially increase the SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio), potentially enabling more accurate analysis. A non-limiting example method of cleaning up the HF signal is described in above-mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 8,626,275. In some embodiments the high frequency electrogram signals are optionally aligned based on one or more of the following: a time of depolarization onset of the heart as detected in an electrogram, optionally an electrogram picked up by an electrode in the heart, preferably in the right atrium; anda time of pacing by a pacemaker in the Right Atrium (RA), Right Ventricle (RV) or Left Ventricle (LV). The Breathing Cycle The terms breathing cycle portion and breathing cycle segment are used interchangeably in the specification and claims. A linkage between a breathing cycle and heart rate is known in the literature and referred to as Respiratory Arrhythmia. The heart rate, in turn, is among the factors which govern the behavior of the high frequency ECG signal, which results in a potential coupling between analysis of high frequency ECG signals parameters and the breathing cycle. In some embodiments the breathing cycle is optionally analyzed and comparison of high frequency ECG analysis results is optionally done between measurements taken at similar times in the breathing cycle. For example, a comparison of high frequency ECG parameters is performed between high frequency ECG parameters measured at maximum exhalation. Reference is now made to FIG. 3, which is a simplified prior art illustration of effects of breathing on electrocardiogram signals. FIG. 3 depicts a graph 300 of respiration-induced modulation of QRS amplitude in a regular ECG signal. An upper trace 302 depicts an ECG trace, and a lower trace 304 depicts respiration as measured by a pneumatic respiration transducer (PRT) placed around a chest of a subject. The upper trace 302 and the lower trace 304 depict measurements over a duration of 10 seconds. The graph 300 is taken from the above-mentioned article titled “Derivation of Respiratory Signals from Multi-lead ECGs” by Moody et al. FIG. 3 depicts and the article teaches a method for analyzing QRS amplitude in a regular ECG signal and respiratory actions. In some embodiments, high frequency ECG parameters are measured only during a specific portion of a breathing cycle, by way of some non-limiting examples, when QRS amplitude is maximal or when QRS amplitude is minimal. In some embodiments detecting the segment of the breathing cycle includes measuring amplitude of a QRS complex of a low frequency electrogram. In some embodiments, high frequency ECG parameters are measured only during a specific portion of a breathing cycle, by way of some non-limiting examples, when the cardiac cycle is shorter than average or when the cardiac cycle is longer than average. In some embodiments detecting the segment of the breathing cycle comprises measuring a duration of a cardiac cycle. In some embodiments, high frequency ECG parameters are measured only once during a breathing cycle instead of every heart beat. Such embodiments provide a method of potentially saving power. In some embodiments the stages of the breathing are optionally measured by one or more motion sensors in or connected to the implanted device. In some embodiments the stages of the breathing are optionally measured by a strap around the chest. In such embodiments the strap is optionally communicating with an analysis unit, optionally an external analysis unit using electrodes with a body, such as inserted via a catheter. In some embodiments the stages of the breathing are optionally measured by an audio sensor. Such detection by audio sensors can potentially operate both in implantable devices and in external devices. In some embodiments the stages of the breathing are optionally measured by a spirometric device. A spirometric device may be in a unit external to a subject's body, sending a signal to an implanted unit to enable detecting the stages of the breathing. In some embodiments, use of the stages of breathing during HF signal analysis is enabled when a signal from the spirometric device is received by the implanted device. In some embodiments, the stages of breathing are not used during HF signal measurements when a signal from the spirometric device is not received by the implanted device. In some embodiments, detecting a portion of the breathing cycle is optionally performed by using motion sensors and analysis to detect cyclic movement of a subject's chest. In some embodiments, the specific stages of the breathing cycle are optionally selected based on characterization of electrogram based on low frequency features such as amplitude of the QRS complex and/or a time within a cardiac cycle. Additional Physiological Sensors Using state-of-the-art physiological sensors such as, by way of a non-limiting example, a bioimpedance sensor such as Optivol by Medtronic, it is possible to measure physiological parameters, such as, by way of a non-limiting example, blood pressure in various loci, for example, in the pulmonary arteries. Additional non-limiting examples of physiological sensors include implantable hemodynamic monitoring using the Chronicle IHM system by Medtronic and the pressure monitor named heartPOD by St Jude Medical. Such measurements provide a potentially more accurate description of a subject's status, and potentially correlate to the High frequency ECG results as well as to other parameters relating to a given physiological conditions. The High frequency ECG parameters may potentially have natural variations, even under normal circumstances. Gating or triggering an analysis of the HF signal based on values of physiological parameters such as blood pressure, pulse and breathing cycle, potentially render the High frequency ECG analysis more sensitive and accurate, increasing its usefulness for the indication of ischemic states and ischemic disease. Simultaneous acquisition, and/or registration and/or analysis of High frequency ECG and additional variables (such as blood pressure, Heart rhythm and rate, ST changes, T-wave abnormalities, T-wave alternance, etc.) potentially provide at least the following two consequences. First, the High frequency ECG is optionally analyzed and evaluated with respect to a multi-parameter state when recording a person's baseline. Second, High frequency ECG measurements are optionally made or analyzed only at certain, possibly predetermined, multi-parameter states. In some embodiments the system also includes means for measuring and analyzing a low frequency electrogram signal. Low frequency electrogram analysis optionally includes analysis of: heart rate, ST segment changes, heart rate variability, T wave abnormalities including T-wave inversion and T-wave alternance; and QT interval. In some embodiments, specific categories are defined, each category including a range of values for variables. The variables include results of analysis, such as values of HF electrogram analysis indexes and values of low frequency electrogram analysis; and values of physiological measurements, such as blood pressure, heart rhythm and rate, ST changes, T-wave abnormalities, T-wave alternance, etc. In some embodiments a medical pathological condition is optionally detected when there is a consistent change in both High frequency electrogram indexes and other parameters such ST changes in a regular ECG trace, and/or a change in heart rate. When a correlation between the HF electrogram indexes and the other parameters appears more than a specific number of times in a row this is optionally an indication for ischemia. In some embodiments, when more than one, two, 5 or 10 such correlations appear per day an alert is produced. In some embodiments, determining a baseline for use in a later comparison, in order to detect ischemia, is optionally done by continuous measurements and constant updating. In some embodiments ischemia is detected by reaching specific high frequency ECG values. By way of example when changes in RMS values of the high frequency ECG are greater than 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50% of a reference RMS value. In some embodiments, for a morphological index as described in above-mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 8,626,275, a change in the morphological index greater than 2%, 4%, 5%, 7%, 10%, or 15% of a reference morphological index value optionally indicates possible ischemia. In various embodiments, reference values, also termed baseline values, are determined by various methods. Some non-limiting example methods include: using a historical average value which was measured over a previous day, week, month or year. In some embodiments the historical average is optionally selected so as to be sensitive to heart rate and optionally to additional physiological conditions; and using a baseline value which was measured at one time during a setup period or a set up test. In some embodiments the baseline value is optionally measured under similar conditions, such as similar heart rate (pulse) and/or similar breathing rate and/or a similar portion of a cardiac cycle and/or a similar portion of a breathing cycle. In some embodiments acute ischemia is detected by detecting changes compared to the baseline. In some embodiments acute ischemia is detected by detecting changes in HF electrogram parameters measured at a low heart rate period and at a higher heart rate period. In some embodiments that change in heart rate between the two periods is greater than 10%, 20%, 40%, 50%, 100%. In some embodiments, by tracking the physiological and High frequency ECG parameters of the baseline itself a slow deterioration in a subject's condition is optionally detected. In some embodiments, the High frequency ECG parameters are used for a differential diagnosis between ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). During VT a morphological index and/or amplitude of the HF signal changes from beat to beat, while in SVT a change from beat to beat is typically not significant. In some embodiments, trends of calculated values are calculated and/or stored and/or transmitted. The calculated values include, by way of some non-limiting example, regular ECG values, HF electrogram values, values as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,626,275, and so on. In some embodiments, correlations between calculated values are calculated and/or stored and/or transmitted. Intracoronary Electrodes In some embodiments, one or more intracoronary electrodes are used for acquisition of the electrogram. In some embodiments, the intracoronary electrodes are optionally located near to a known and/or to a suspected partial or complete occlusion in an artery. The electrogram signal is optionally measured proximally and distally from the occlusion, and High frequency ECG values of the signal are optionally compared to examine differences in the electrical characteristics of the tissues proximal and distal to the occlusion. The differences potentially indicate changes in vitality and potentially indicate an ischemic condition. By way of a non-limiting example, a change in HF indexes between a point before blockage and a point after the blockage change significantly. A change in RMS HF values of greater than 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50% of a reference HF RMS value and/or a change in a morphological index by more than 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% or 6% of a reference morphological index. Reference is now made to FIG. 4A, which is a simplified illustration of electrodes for picking up an electrogram within a blood vessel according to an example embodiment of the invention. FIG. 4A depicts an example blood vessel, an artery 402. The artery 402 has, for example, a blockage 404. A first electrode 406 having a bipolar pickup 407 is inserted up until beyond the blockage 404. A second electrode 408 having a bipolar pickup 409 is inserted until before the blockage 404. In some embodiments one or both of the electrodes 406408 may be monopolar electrodes (not shown) or multipolar electrodes (not shown). In some embodiments there is a use of single electrode configuration which measures the electrogram at both locations: before and beyond the blockage 404. Reference is now made to FIG. 4B, which is a simplified illustration of electrodes for picking up an electrogram within a blood vessel according to another example embodiment of the invention. FIG. 4B depicts an example blood vessel, an artery 402. The artery 402 has, for example, a blockage 404. A first electrode 416 having a bipolar pickup 417 is inserted up until beyond the blockage 404. The first electrode 416 also includes an electronics unit 422, which optionally communicates wirelessly with an external analyzer 424, transmitting a signal corresponding to an HF signal picked up by the bipolar pickup 417. A second electrode 418 having a bipolar pickup 419 is inserted until before the blockage 404. The second electrode 418 also includes an electronics unit 420, which optionally communicates wirelessly with the external analyzer 424, transmitting a signal corresponding to an HF signal picked up by the bipolar pickup 419. In some embodiments one or both of the electrodes 416418 may be monopolar electrodes (not shown) or multipolar electrodes (not shown). In some embodiments there is a use of single electrode configuration which measures the electrogram at both locations: before and beyond the blockage 404, at different times. In some embodiments High frequency ECG measurement by intracoronary electrodes potentially assists in determining whether stent placement is recommended. A change in RMS HF values of greater than 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50% of a reference HF RMS value, and/or a change in a morphological index by more than 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% or 6% of a reference morphological index optionally assist in determining whether stent placement is recommended. In some embodiments High frequency ECG measurement by intracoronary electrodes is optionally combined with FFR (fractional flow reserve) analysis and also potentially assists in determining whether stent placement is recommended. FFR analysis typically measures local pressure in a blood vessel. If the pressure drops below a set pressure the drop is an indication that there might be a benefit for inserting a stent. The FFR method typically evaluates whether there is a collateral blood supply or whether tissue is necrotic due to lack of blood circulation. The above-mentioned determinations of coronary vessel condition and/or treatment may be performed both by implantable electrodes and by electrodes temporarily inserted by catheter. The above-mentioned determinations of coronary vessel condition are potentially useful for post-revascularization evaluation of the revascularization efficacy. In some embodiments, the coronary blood vessel in which the electrogram is measured with relation to the occlusion is a coronary artery. In some embodiments, the coronary blood vessel the coronary blood vessel is a coronary vein. In some embodiments the coronary blood vessel is the coronary sinus. In some embodiments detection of ischemia onset is performed based on a change in one or more of the following parameters of the HF signal of an electrogram over at least one intracardiac electrode: an RMS level of the HF signal of the electrogram; a function of the RMS levels of the HF signal of the electrogram in different portions of the cardiac cycle, such as, for example, a P or a T portion of the cardiac cycle; an envelope maximum of the high frequency signal of the electrogram; a function of the envelope levels in different portions of the cardiac cycle, of the high frequency signal of an electrogram; an envelope width of the high frequency signal of an electrogram, as described in above-mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 8,626,275; an area of a reduced amplitude zone (RAZ) of the electrogram HF signal, as described in above-mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 8,626,275; and an area of a RAZ in the envelope of the electrogram HF Signal, as described in above-mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 8,626,275. In some embodiments a HF portion of an electrogram is measured using at least one intracardiac electrode. In some embodiments the following configurations are optionally used for measuring an intracardiac electrogram HF signal: a single monopolar electrode that measures a signal between an intracardiac electrode and a can (container) of an implantable device; a bipolar electrode; two intracardiac electrodes placed at different places within the heart; one intracardiac and one epicardiac electrode; and two epicardiac electrodes. In some embodiments a bipolar electrode, also termed a lead, is optionally used, having two electrical pickup points, which may also be termed two electrodes. In some embodiments the distance between the two electrical pickup points is 1-3 millimeters, or 1-5 millimeters, or 1-7 millimeters or 1-10 millimeters, which potentially measure a local change in an electrogram, potentially measuring a difference in the electrogram between the two adjacent electrical pickup points. In some embodiments detection of ischemia and/or of onset of ischemia is optionally based, at least in part, on a function of RMS values of an electrogram HF signal, optionally measured using one of the above-mentioned electrode configurations. In some embodiments detection of ischemia and/or of onset of ischemia is optionally based, at least in part, on a comparison of RMS values of an electrogram HF signal, optionally at different instances of similar heart rate values, such as, for example: a difference between the RMS values exceeding a threshold difference value; and a ratio between the RMS values exceeding a threshold ratio value. In some embodiments detection and differentiation between ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia is optionally based, at least in part, on a function of RMS values of electrogram HF signal, using one of the above-mentioned electrode configurations. In some embodiments differentiating between ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia is optionally based, at least in part, on a comparison of RMS values of electrogram HF signal at different instances of similar heart rate values. The difference and/or the ratio of the RMS values measured, using one of the above-mentioned electrode configurations, are optionally considered for the differentiation. By way of a non-limiting example, if at different time periods which have an approximately similar high heart rate there is a significant difference in a HF RMS value, the difference potentially indicates existence of tachycardia originating from the ventricle (VT), as described above. In some embodiments acquisition of the high frequency electrogram signal is performed using intracoronary monopolar and/or bipolar electrodes in one or more locations relative to a complete and/or partial occlusion and/or suspected occlusion of a coronary artery. In some embodiments, the HF electrogram signal proximally and distally from an occlusion is optionally acquired and optionally compared. In some embodiments, one or more of the following parameters is optionally compared between a proximal and a distal HF electrogram signal: a difference between RMS values at the proximal and distal locations; a ratio between the RMS values at the proximal and distal locations; and a function of numerical characteristics of the HF signal envelopes at the proximal and distal locations. In some embodiments detection of a difference in ischemic condition and/or vitality between two locations near a complete or partial occlusion of a coronary artery is optionally based, at least in part, on the methods and apparatus described above. In some embodiments detection of difference in ischemic condition and/or vitality between two electrode locations near a complete or partial occlusion of a coronary artery is optionally based, at least in part, on the methods and apparatus described above, optionally also combined with results from FFR (fractional flow reserve) analysis. In some embodiments detection of difference in ischemic condition and/or vitality between two locations near a complete or partial occlusion of a coronary artery is optionally based on the methods and apparatus described above, optionally for assisting in determining whether stent therapy is needed. In some embodiments detection of difference in ischemic condition and/or vitality between two electrode locations near a complete or partial occlusion of a coronary artery is optionally based, at least in part, on the methods and apparatus described above, optionally for post-revascularization assessment of revascularization results and current ischemic condition.
