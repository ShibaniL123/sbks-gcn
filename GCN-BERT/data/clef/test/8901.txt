This application is also related to U.S. Patent Application No. 14/679,062 and International Patent Application No. PCT/US2015/24422, both filed on April 6, 2015, both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD Described herein are abuse deterrent controlled release oral pharmaceutical compositions and methods for making the same. In particular, an abuse deterrent controlled release oral pharmaceutical composition comprising a soft capsule and an abuse deterrent controlled release matrix comprising an active pharmaceutical ingredient are described. BACKGROUND Increased attention has been drawn to the recreational use and abuse of prescription pharmaceutical compositions. The abuse, or non-medicinal use, of prescription pharmaceutical compositions is an increasing problem. Accordingly, preventing the abuse of prescription pharmaceuticals through the development of abuse deterrent pharmaceutical compositions has become a high public health priority for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Prescription pharmaceutical compositions that are typically misused or abused fall, primarily, into three groups: (1) opioids prescribed for pain; (2) Central Nervous System (CNS) depressants prescribed for anxiety or sleep problems; and (3) stimulants, prescribed, for example, for attention deficit hyperactivity, narcolepsy, or obesity. Methods for abusing prescription pharmaceutical compositions are varied and can include, for example, extraction, boiling, melting, volatilization, physical tampering (e.g., grinding, grating, crushing, etc.), or direct administration. For purposes of abuse, methods of administering active drug substances obtained from prescription pharmaceutical compositions or WCSR 33957343vl 1 of the pharmaceutical compositions themselves are similarly diverse and include, for example, injection, smoking, snorting, swallowing, sublingual or buccal administration, chewing, or administration as an anal or vaginal suppository. Alcohol-induced "dose dumping," i.e., the rapid release of active pharmaceutical ingredients in the presence of a solvent such as ethanol, is also an abuse concern and safety issue. Other methods include rapid extraction under aqueous boiling conditions. There are a number of strategies for preventing the abuse of pharmaceuticals. Physical and chemical barriers can prevent the extraction of the drug or change the form of the drug making it less likely to be abused. Combinations of agonists and antagonists can be used, wherein the antagonist is only released upon product manipulation or tampering. Another strategy is to use aversive compounds that produce an unpleasant effect when the dosage form is tampered with. In addition, prodrugs can be used, which are only changed into the active form of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract. The pharmaceutical industry is utilizing these strategies to develop abuse-deterrent pharmaceutical compositions in order to reduce the potential for misuse of prescription pharmaceutical compositions. Accordingly, there is a need for abuse deterrent pharmaceutical compositions that have controlled release properties. The matrix formulations described herein minimize the likelihood of tampering, "dose dumping," or the extraction of active pharmaceutical ingredients from the composition. In particular, there is a need for formulations that are resistant to active pharmaceutical ingredient extraction under boiling conditions.

The pharmaceutical compositions described herein provide abuse deterrent matrices and methods for preparation thereof. Also described herein are compositions and methods for manufacturing soft capsules comprising abuse deterrent controlled release pharmaceutical matrices. In some embodiments described herein, the soft capsule is an enteric soft capsule. The term "abuse deterrent," or "tamper resistant" as used herein, refers to a pharmaceutical composition that is resistant to tampering or accessing the active pharmaceutical ingredient for recreational drug use or drug abuse. The phrase "recreational drug use," as used herein, refers to the voluntary use of an active pharmacetical agent or drug for a non-medical purpose to induce an effect, such as pleasure, satisfaction, euphoria, dissociation, or to enhance an experience. The term "drug abuse," as use herein, refers to the habitual, compulsive, or recurrent use of an active pharmaceutical agent or drug, often despite negative consequences. The term "tampering," as used herein, refers to any kind of actual or attempted physical manipulation or interference that may result in particle size reduction of a pharmaceutical composition. Tampering, as used herein also includes any actual or attempted dissolution or extraction of active pharmaceutical ingredients using solvents. Compositions that are resistant to physical tampering are formulated in such a way that the composition cannot readily reduced to a form that is suitable for abuse, such as, for example, injection or snorting, because the tablet cannot easily be ground, grated, dissolved, extracted, and the like at any temperature. Examples of physical tampering include, but are not limited to, crushing, grinding, grating, cutting, crisping, and other methods of particle size reduction. Dissolution tampering includes actual or attempted actions to dissolve or extract active pharmaceutical ingredients using aqueous or organic solvents such as water, ethanol, isopropanol, ethyl acetate, acetone, ether, or the like, at any temperature including boiling. Tampering, as used herein, includes "dose dumping." The term "dose dumping" or "dumping" as used herein refers to the rapid release of the entire amount or a significant fraction of an active pharmaceutical ingredient or drug. Drug abusers often intentionally pursue dumping of a drug from the dosage form. The terms "drug", "active ingredient," "active pharmaceutical ingredient," or "active pharmaceutical agent" as used herein refer to an agent, active ingredient, compound, or substance, compositions, or mixtures thereof, that provide a pharmacological, often beneficial, effect. Reference to a specific active ingredient includes, where appropriate, the active ingredient and any of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters. The terms "dosage" or "dose" denote any form of the active ingredient formulation that contains an amount sufficient to produce a therapeutic effect with a single administration. The dosage form used herein is for oral administration. The preferred oral dosage forms are soft capsules or enteric soft capsules. The terms "active pharmaceutical ingredient load" or "drug load" as used herein refers to the quantity (mass) of the active pharmaceutical ingredient comprised in a single soft capsule fill. The term "formulation" or "composition" as used herein refers to the active pharmaceutical ingredient or drug in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.

In one embodiment, the surfactant comprises Pluronic® F127, Tween® 80, Span® 80, IGEPAL®, Triton™ X-100, or Capmul® MCM. In another embodiment, the abuse deterrent matrix comprises one or more organogelator controlled release polymers. An organogel is a cross-linked fibrous three-dimensional network. These types of gels are formed in a liquid organic phase via the covalent polymerization of monomers through reactive groups or aggregation and self-assembly of monomers. The assembly of these monomers occurs through extensive van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, or dipole-dipole interactions, among others. At or near the gel-point, the network is strong enough that the liquid solution is gel-like with physical rheological properties. In general, organogelators relying on hydrogen bonding are amino acids, amides, urea moieties, and carbohydrates or carbohydrate derivatives. Covalent or chemical-type organogelators typically are anthracene, anthraquinone, or steroid-based molecules. Potential suitable organogelators for the abuse deterrent matricis described herein include but are not limited to the simplest n-alkanes (C24_36), which function to gel other short alkanes, such as hexadecane; substituted fatty acids (e.g., 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid or 1, 3:2,4-di-0- benzylidene-D-sorbitol (D-DBS), steroids and derivatives; anthryl derivatives (e.g., 2,3-bis-n- decyloxyanthracene); macrocyclic gelators (e.g., calixarenes); aromatic linked steroidal groups; cyclodipeptides; bisurea compounds; bisamides; bolaform amides; alkyl perfluoroalkanamides; carbohydrate derivatives, cellulose derivatives, such as ethyl cellulose; perfluoroalkanes and carbon dioxide; methyl 2,6,-diisocyanatohexanoate and alkylamines; primary alkyl amines; any light-responsive gelator; oxadiazole-based benzene; 1,3,5-tricarboxamide; cobalt (II) triazole complexes; and fatty acid derivatives of L-alanine; sorbitan monostearate based organogelators; metha methacrylate based organogels (e.g., mixtures of Eudragit® and polyhydric alcohols); gelatin microemulsions; lecithin based organogels; poloxamer and lecithin; or mixtures or combinations thereof. Additional organogelators are described by Murdan., Expert. Opin. Drug Deliv. 2(3): 489-505 (2005), which is incorporated by reference herein for its specific teachings thereof. Gelation of organogels occurs at a certain temperature depending on the polymer. Typically, the solution is heated, which allows for the dissolution of the gelator polymer into an organic liquid and subsequent gelation as temperature drops. The gel-point temperature can be modified by the addition of different solvents or surfactants. A common method for extracting abuse prone drugs is by boiling the composition. Thus, in some embodiments, the abuse deterrent matrices described herein reduce the percentage of released active pharmaceutical ingredient released during boiling conditions. Without being bound by any theory, it is thought that the extensive three dimensional network formed by the organogelator polymers in the abuse deterrent controlled release matricis described herein slows the release of active pharmaceutical ingredients under boiling conditions. Thus, in some embodiments described herein, suitable organogelator molecules for the controlled release matricis described herein gel in boiling temperatures from about 95 °C to about 120 °C. Most organogelators, including the principally used low molecular weight organogelators, are thermoreversible and lose their rheological properties upon extensive heat. Other organogelators react with active pharmaceutical ingredients and prevent the formation of a strong gel network or are water-soluble. Thus, it was uniquely found that the ethyl ether derivative of cellulose, ethyl cellulose, is water insoluble and forms an excellent organogel at a boiling temperature of about 100 °C in a soft gelatin capsule comprising an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Further, it was found that the gel strength and gel-point temperature could be further customized by the level of ethoxylation or with the addition of surfactants or different molecular weight ethyl cellulose. Ethyl cellulose is available in a variety of molecular weights denoted as a centipoise viscosity value (cP), and useful ethyl cellulose polymers have a cP value of about 3 cP to about 350 cP. Thus, in another embodiment described herein, the abuse deterrent matrix comprises one or more organogelators including but not limited to ethyl cellulose (e.g., Ethocel™). In one aspect, ethyl cellulose has a cP of about 4 to about 100. In another aspect, ethyl cellulose has a cP of about 4, about 8, about 12, about 16, about 20, about 24, about 28, about 32, about 36, about 40, about 48, about 52, about 56, about 60, about 64, about 68, about 72, about 76, about 80, about 84, about 88, about 92, about 96, or about 100. In another aspect, ethyl cellulose has a cP of about 4. In another aspect, ethyl cellulose has a cP of about 20. In another embodiment, the abuse deterrent matrix comprises a disintegrant excipient. Disintegrants, useful in the abuse deterrent matrices described herein, include any polymer, which expands in acqueous solution, which causes a tablet or capsule to burst and facilitate dissolution. Exemplary, non-limiting disintegrants comprise crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone (e.g., crospovidone), crosslinked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (croscarmellose sodium) carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, cysteine HC1, modified starches (e.g., sodium starch glycolate), cellulose, calcium silicate, silicon dioxide, alginic acid, sodium alginate, citric acid, microcrystalline cellulose, polyoxy stearate, sodium croscarmellose, sodium lauryl sulfate, or a mixture or combination thereof. In one aspect, the disintegrant comprises microcrystalline cellulose. In another embodiment, the abuse deterrent matrix comprises one or more hydrophilic vehicles. Suitable, non-limiting hydrophilic vehicles comprise hydro-alcohols including propylene glycol, or polyethylene glycols of a molecular weight ranging from about 200 to about 8000 or a mixture or combination thereof. In one aspect, the release enhancer comprises polyethylene glycol. In another aspect, the release enhancer comprises polyethylene glycol 400. In another embodiment, the abuse deterrent matrix comprises one or more hydrophilic polymers. Suitable, non-limiting hydrophilic polymers comprise methylcellulose (e.g., Methocel™), hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, polymethylmethacrylate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, or combinations thereof. Without being bound by any theory, it is thought that water coming into contact with hydrophilic cellulose derivatives, such as methylcellulose, causes it to expand or swell and further impede the release of active pharmaceutical ingredients from the matrix. In one aspect, the hydrophilic polymer comprises methylcellulose (e.g., Methocel™). In another aspect, methylcellulose has a cP of about 500 to about 10,000. In another aspect, methy cellulose as a cP of about 500, about 750, about 1000, about 1500, about 2000, about 2500, about 3000, about 3500, about 4000, about 4500, about 5000, about 6000, about 7000, about 8000, about 9000, or about 10000. In another aspect, methylcellulose has a cP of about 4000 (e.g., Methocel™ A4M). In another embodiment, the abuse-deterrent matrix comprises one or more antioxidants. Suitable antioxidants comprise tocopherols (e.g., alpha-tocopherol, beta-tocopherol, gamma- tocopherol, or delta-tocopherol), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), citric acid, ascorbic acid, phenolic diterpenes (e.g., carnosic acid, carnosol, rosmanol, epirosmanol, isorosmanol, or methyl carnosate), rosmarinic acid, eugenol, eugenyl acetate, clove bud extract, methanolic extract, tea catechins (e.g., epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, or epicatechin), or combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the abuse deterrent matrix can include a hydrophilic internal phase and a lipid or lipophilic external phase (water in oil) or a lipid or lipophilic internal phase and a hydrophilic external phase (oil in water). The internal phase can also be structured. A "structured" phase, as used herein, means a solid, semisolid, or a gel whose shape is relatively stable and does not usually aggregate to form a large globule. One or more structured phases provide controlled drug release and stabilize the physical state of the matrix. Without being bound to any theory, it is believed that a structured matrix impedes solvation and/or diffusion of the active pharmaceutical ingredient out of the matrix after the capsule shell dissolves. In another embodiment, the active pharmaceutical ingredient can be dispersed in the internal phase as a suspension form. A suspension as used herein means the API does not dissolve in one of the phases and remains as a solid. In one embodiment, the active pharmaceutical ingredient is dispersed or suspended in the internal phase as a solid form. In one embodiment described herein, the abuse deterrent matrix may comprise one or more liquid lipophilic vehicles, one or more semisolid lipid vehicles, one or more organogelators, one or more hydrophilic polymers, one or more hydrophilic vehicles, one or more anti-oxidants, one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients, optionally one or more disintegrants, and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. In one aspect, the combination of matrix fill components prevents or reduces the likelihood of extraction of an active pharmaceutical ingredient in aqueous or boiling conditions. Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that the presence of the components of the abuse deterrent matrix compositions described herein function to inhibit drug release from the pharmaceutical compositions described herein. In one aspect, a semi solid lipid vehicle (e.g., bee's wax or carnauba wax) forms a highly viscous structure and inhibits the release of active pharmaceutical ingredients from the matrix fill in acqueous conditions. In another aspect, the semi-solid lipid vehicle prevents release in an aqueous solvent (e.g., pure water or a mixture of ethanol and water) at low to middle ranges of temperatures (e.g., from about 20 °C to about 85 °C). In one aspect, the presence of a hydrophilic polymer (e.g., methylcellulose) is soluble in water demonstrating controlled release swelling properties but is insoluble in ethanol, which further helps reduce the release of an active pharmaceutical ingredient in aqueous solutions of ethanol. In one aspect, the organogelator prevents the release of active pharmaceutical ingredients at boiling or near-boiling temperatures by forming a three dimensional network, which prevents drug release at high temperatures. In one aspect, the hydrophilic vehicle enhances the release of active pharmaceutical ingredients in the stomach and gastro intestinal tract. In one aspect, the one or more optional disintegrants functions to swell and de-structure the matrix and increase the release rate of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the matrix compositions described herein permit abuse deterrence by preventing liberation of the active ingredient for injection or insufflation and prevent solvation, dissolution, or extraction of the active pharmaceutical ingredient by use of aqueous or organic solutions. Furthermore, the matrix compositions also provide controlled release delivery of the active pharmaceutical ingredient after ingestion by a subject. In another embodiment described herein, the abuse deterrent matrix described herein prevents extraction of an active pharmaceutical ingredient through the additional means of crushing, grating, grinding, or cutting dosage forms comprising the pharmaceutical compositions described herein. In one aspect, increasing the weight percentage of semisolid lipid vehicle, organogelator, and hydrophilic polymer in the matrix fill increases the overall viscosity of the matrix fill solution and decreases the release rate of an active pharmaceutical ingredient in acqueous solvents and acqueous solvents in boiling conditions. Conversely, in another aspect, decreasing the weight percentage of semisolid lipid vehicle, organogelator, and hydrophilic polymer decreases the overall viscosity of the matrix fill solution and decreases the release rate of an active pharmaceutical ingredient in acqueous solvents and acqueous solvents in boiling conditions. Thus, the abuse deterrent matricis described herein are compatible with a broad range of active pharmaceutical ingredients and demonstrate abuse deterrent properties. In another embodiment, the lipid or lipophilic vehicle comprises a liquid lipid or lipophilic vehicle, a semisolid lipid or lipophilic vehicle, or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the total lipid or lipophilic vehicle comprises one or more liquid lipid vehicles and one or more semi-solid lipid vehicles.

See Remington 's Essentials of Pharmaceutics, Pharmaceutical Press Publishing Company, London, UK, 1st Edition, 2013, which is incorporated by reference herein for such teachings. In another embodiment described herein, the pharmaceutical composition comprises an enteric soft capsule shell comprising a matrix fill comprising an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Enteric soft capsules are described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2004/030658; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2006/0165778; and U.S. Patent No. 8,685,445, each of which is incorporated by reference herein for such teachings. The enteric soft capsule shell may comprise one or more film forming polymers, one or more enteric acid- insoluble polymers, one or more plasticizers, one or more alkali-neutralizing agents, one or more solvents, optionally one or more colorants, and optionally one or more flavorings or other conventionally accepted pharmaceutical excipients or additives. Film-former polymers that are useful for creating enteric soft capsules are gelatin, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) or carrageenan (e.g., iota carrageenan and kappa carrageenan). In one aspect of the enteric soft capsule shell described herein, the film- forming polymer is gelatin.

Examples of enteric, acid-insoluble polymers are acrylic and methacrylate acid copolymers, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), cellulose acetate butyrate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), algenic acid salts such as sodium or potassium alginate, or shellac. Poly(methacylic acid-co-methyl methacrylate) anionic copolymers based on methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate are particularly stable and are preferred in some embodiments. Poly(meth)acrylates (methacrylic acid copolymer), available under the trade name EUDRAGIT® (Evonik Industries AG, Essen, Germany), are provided as powder or aqueous dispersions. In one aspect, the methacrylic acid copolymer can be EUDRAGIT® L 30 D-55; EUDRAGIT® L 100-55; EUDRAGIT® L 100; EUDRAGIT® L 12.5; EUDRAGIT® S 100; EUDRAGIT® S 12.5; EUDRAGIT® FS 30 D; EUDRAGIT® E 100; EUDRAGIT® E 12.5; EUDRAGIT® E PO; EUDRAGIT® RL 100; EUDRAGIT® RL PO; EUDRAGIT® RL 30 D; EUDRAGIT® RL 12.5; EUDRAGIT® RS 100; EUDRAGIT® RS PO; EUDRAGIT® RS 30 D; EUDRAGIT® RS 12.5; EUDRAGIT® NE 30 D; EUDRAGIT® NE 40 D; EUDRAGIT® NM 30 D; or other poly(meth)acrylate polymers. In one aspect, the enteric polymer is EUDRAGIT® L 100, a methacrylic acid copolymer, Type A. Acid-insoluble polymer specifications are detailed in the United States Pharmacopoeia and in various monographs. Plasticizers that are useful for creating enteric soft capsules as described herein are glycerol, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol, citric acid, citric acid esters, such as tri-ethyl citrate, or combinations thereof. The weight ratio between the film-forming polymer, the enteric acid- insoluble polymer, and plasticizer is adjusted so that the gel mass is flowable and not too viscous, and can be made into soft capsules using rotary die encapsulation methods. In one embodiment, enteric soft capsule shell compositions can be made by dissolving the enteric acid-insoluble polymer in an aqueous solution of an alkali neutralizing agent such as ammonia, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or liquid amines such as tri-ethanol amine or ethylene diamine. The amount of alkali is adjusted to give a final pH value of the gel mass less than or equal to about pH 9.0. In one embodiment, the final pH does not exceed 8.5. The volatile alkali neutralizing agent, ammonia is preferred. The film-forming polymer can then be combined with the plasticizer and solvent and then blended with the acid-insoluble gel to make a final homogeneous mix in a heat-controlled vessel and can be degassed by using vacuum. The fugitive ammonia evaporates during degassing. Using the foregoing process, the alkali concentrations do not require an additional step such as heating or neutralizing with acid in order to neutralize the gel mass. In another embodiment described herein, an enteric soft capsule shell can be made by using an aqueous dispersion of the acid-insoluble polymer by adding alkaline materials such as ammonium, sodium, or potassium hydroxides, other alkalis, or a combination thereof that will cause the enteric acid-insoluble polymer to dissolve. The plasticizer-wetted, film-forming polymer can then be mixed with the solution of the acid-insoluble polymer. In one embodiment, enteric acid-insoluble polymers in the form of salts of the above-mentioned bases or alkalis can be dissolved directly in water and mixed with the plasticizer-wetted, film- forming polymer. In one embodiment, an enteric soft capsule shell has the composition of Table 4, including all possible iterations of the specified ranges that provide 100% for the total weight percentage, including or excluding the optional, excipients, opacifiers, colorants, and flavorings.

One embodiment described herein provides an enteric acid-insoluble polymer dispersed within the film-forming polymer gel mass that provides the total soft gel composition with enteric acid-insoluble properties, at relatively low concentrations of the enteric acid-insoluble polymer (e.g., from about 8% to about 20% of the total wet gel mass composition) and without the need of excessive amounts of alkali, thus avoiding denaturation or degradation of the film- forming polymer that can weaken the integrity of the enteric soft capsule shell. In some embodiments, the enteric soft capsule shell does not dissolve or disintegrate in acids, such as 0.1 N hydrochloric acid or simulated gastric fluid (ca. pH 1.2), despite the fact that the majority of the shell ingredients (i.e., greater than 50%) normally dissolve in, or are miscible with, acids. In some embodiments, the enteric soft capsules made using the compositions described herein remain intact in hydrochloric acid or simulated gastric fluid for at least two hours and the capsules readily release their contents upon shifting the pH of the solution to ca. 6.8, such as that of simulated intestinal fluid. In one aspect, the enteric soft capsule is resistant to dissolution at about pH 1.2 for at least about 2 hours. In another aspect, the enteric soft capsule begins dissolution at pH of about 6.8 within about 10 min. In another embodiment, the final enteric capsule composition provides films of increased strength without substantially compromising film elasticity. Moreover, films made from the enteric soft capsule compositions as described herein can be sealed at normal temperature range typically used for making traditional soft gel capsules. In one aspect, enteric soft capsules are made using a rotary die apparatus as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,459,983; 5,146,730; and 6,482,516, each of which are incorporated by reference herein for such teachings.

In another embodiment, a the pharmaceutical composition described herein provides for a dosage form, which comprises an opioid and a PAMORA as described in, which provides a reduction of days with laxative intake by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or even 90%>. In one aspect, the dosage form completely reduces the need for laxative to be taken independently. In some embodiments, bowel function is assessed by observing parameters that are associated with bowel function. In particular, bowel function may be determined based on parameters selected from ease or difficulty of defecation, feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation, and/or personal judgment of patient regarding constipation. Other parameters which may be observed alternatively or in addition in order to assess the bowel function of a patient include among other things stool frequency, stool consistency, cramping, and painful laxation. Bowel function may be assessed by measuring parameters, which are associated with bowel function using numerical analog scales (NAS) for these parameters because this may provide more accurate results. This approach is particularly advantageous when assessing the bowel function in patients receiving treatment with analgesics, because analgesic efficacy of drugs is usually assessed using a numeric analog scale. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition is provided comprising an opioid and PAMORA as described herein to provide an improvement of the bowel function characterized by an improvement of the mean bowel function score of at least 5, at least about 8, at least about 10 or at least about 15 after administration at steady state or of a single dose to human patients or healthy human subjects, wherein the mean bowel function score is measured with a numerical analog scale ranging from 0 to 100. In one embodiment, the bowel function is assessed by the bowel function index (BFI), which is measured in patients. The mean bowel function score may be determined by a method for assessing bowel function in a patient comprising the steps of: providing the patient with a numeric analog scale for at least one parameter, which parameter is associated with bowel function; causing the patient to indicate on the numeric analog scale the amount and/or intensity of the parameter being experienced; and observing the amount and/or intensity of the at least one parameter indicated on the numeric analog scale in order to assess bowel function. In one aspect the patient indicates the amount and/or intensity of parameter being experienced during the last days or weeks, e.g. during the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, or 14 days. In another aspect, the numerical analog scale on which the patient indicates his/her subjective experience of the observed parameter may have any size or form and may range from 0 or any other number to any number, such as from 0 to 10 or from 0 to 50 or from 0 to 300 or from 1 to 10. In another embodiment, if more than one parameter is observed, a mean bowel function may be obtained in form of a numerical value. This numerical value is the mean of the parameters observed, e.g., the three numeric analog scale values for ease or difficulty of defecation, feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation and judgment of constipation. The parameters, which are measures of bowel function or which are associated with bowel function, may comprise opioid induced bowel dysfunctions (OIBD or OIC) as described herein. In another embodiment, bowel function may be determined based on the following parameters: ease or difficulty of defecation, for example during the last 7 days according to the patient assessment, wherein 0 corresponds to no difficulties and 100 corresponds to severe difficulties; feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation, for example during the last 7 days according to the patient assessment, wherein 0 corresponds to no feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation and 100 corresponds to very strong feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation; personal judgment of patient regarding constipation, for example during the last 7 days, wherein 0 corresponds to no constipation at all and 100 corresponds to very heavy constipation. In another embodiment, bowel function may be assessed with analogs scales as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,258,042 and International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2003/073937, which may be adapted to devices or analog scales as described above as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. The disclosures of these two references are hereby incorporated by reference for such teachings. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions described herein further comprise one or more active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), which prevent drug abuse by inhibiting the action or effects of an opioid. In one aspect, the pharmaceutical composition comprises an opioid (e.g., hydrocodone or oxycodone) and one or more abuse deterrent aversive agents. The abuse deterrent aversive agent may be any one of the a laxative such as lubiprostone, linaclotide, lactulose, and a heavy molecular weight poly ethylene glycol (e.g., PEG 3350; Miralax®; GlycoLax), sorbitol, calcium carbonate, potassium phosphate, magnesium hydroxide, psyllium, glycerin, polycarbophil, or docusate, or a mixture or combination thereof. Further abuse deterrent aversive agents may comprise methylnaltrexone, naltrexone, naloxone, naloxegol, or alvimopan, or a mixture or combination thereof.

The abuse deterrent matrices described herein comprise one or more semi-solid lipophilic vehicles, one or more hygroscopic polymers, one or more hydrophilic polymers, a suspension agent, and an active pharmaceutical ingredient. The process for preparing an abuse deterrent controlled release matrix includes preparing a composition of one or more lipid or lipophilic vehicles, one or more hygroscopic polymers, one or more hydrophilic polymers, optionally one or more non-ionic surfactant, optionally one or more pH buffering agent(s), optionally one or more suspension agents, and one or more active pharmaceutical ingredient by heating said mixture from between 45 °C and 80 °C with stirring or agitation in a suitable vessel. The process further comprises decreasing the matrix mixture temperature to between about 25 °C and about 45 °C followed by a homogenization step, wherein the matrix is homogenized to be substantially flowable. Prior to encapsulation in a soft gel capsule described herein, the matrix is deaerated at a temperature of about 25 °C to about 45 °C. Prior to encapsulation in a soft gel capsule comprising carrageenan as described herein, the matrix is deaerated at a temperature of about 25 °C to about 75 °C. The abuse deterrent matricis as described are multi-component and have a viscous yet flowable aspect as shown in Figure 1 A-C. Figure 1 A is the hydrophilic phase, B is a gelled phase, and C is the final mixture prior to encapsulation. The process for manufacturing a soft capsule comprising the abuse deterrent matricis as described herein includes preparing a gel mass for a soft capsule; casting the gel mass into films or ribbons using heat-controlled drums or surfaces; and manufacturing a soft capsule comprising a matrix fill using rotary die technology. During this process, the abuse deterrent controlled release matrix is injected in to the lumen as the soft capsule is formed by rotary die encapsulation. The soft capsule can be a typical soft capsule ("soft gel") or an enteric soft capsule. Example 3 The dissolution and release profiles under different dissolution conditions for pharmaceutical compositions comprising the abuse deterrent matrix formulations described in Tables 7-16 are shown in Figures 1-15. The abuse deterrent controlled release matrix composition shown in Table 7, generated by the methods described herein and encapsulated in a soft gel capsule as described herein, was tested on its release rate under boiling conditions. As shown in Figure 2, a test pharmaceutical composition comprising the abuse deterrent matrix of Table 7 comprising hydrocodone demonstrated a much lower release rate compared to a reference abuse deterrent pharmaceutical composition comprising either tapentadol or hydrocodone and was on par with reference abuse deterrent pharmaceutical compositions comprising either tapentadol or hydrocodone. As shown in Figure 3, the test pharmaceutical composition comprising the abuse deterrent matrix of Table 7 demonstrated a better release rate of hydrocodone in a dissolution test (Apparatus III at 10 dips/min) in 250 mL of a pH 6.8 buffer when compared to a reference abuse deterrent pharmaceutical composition comprising hydrocodone. The test pharmaceutical composition comprising the abuse deterrent matrix of Table 7 demonstrated a lower release rate of hydrocodone in a dissolution test using Apparatus I at 100 RPM in 500 mL of a 40% solution of ethanol in 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2) compared to a reference abuse deterrent pharmaceutical composition (Figure 4). The test pharmaceutical composition comprising the abuse deterrent matrix of Table 7 demonstrated a similar or lower release rate of hydrocodone in distilled water under agitation at 300 RPM at low temperatures of 4 °C and 25 °C when compared to two different reference abuse deterrent pharmaceutical compositions as shown in Figure 5. Even lower release rates were observed at temperatures of 60 °C and 100 °C (Figure 5). In addition, the test pharmaceutical composition demonstrated lower release rates in distilled water under agitation at 300 RPM from 0.5 hrs to 2 hrs (Figure 6). A test pharmaceutical composition comprising the abuse deterrent matrix of Table 8 hydrocodone had a similar release rate up to two hours in a dissolution test (Apparatus III at 10 dips/min) in a 40% solution of ethanol in 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2) compared to a pH 6.8 buffer (Figure 7). The test pharmaceutical composition comprising the abuse deterrent matrix labelled F8 in Table 16 demonstrated a lower but comparable release rate of oxycodone in a dissolution test (Apparatus III at 10 dips/min) in a simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) buffer comprising 250 mL of a pH 6.8 buffer when compared to a reference abuse deterrent pharmaceutical composition comprising oxycodone (Figure 8). However, as shown in Figure 9, the test pharmaceutical composition demonstrated a lower release rate when compared to a reference abuse deterrent pharmaceutical composition comprising oxycodone (Apparatus III at 10 dips/min) in a 40% solution of ethanol in 0.1 NHC1 (pH 1.2). As further shown in Figure 10, increasing the amount of Ethocel™ between formulations F12 and F13 of Table 16 at a higher viscosity (i.e., 20 cP) dramatically decreased the release rate of oxycodone under boiling conditions. The test pharmaceutical composition comprising the abuse deterrent matrix of Table 9 comprising oxycodone had a similar release rate up to two hours in a dissolution test (Apparatus III at 10 dips/min) in a 40% solution of ethanol in 0.1 N HC1 (pH 1.2) compared to a pH 6.8 buffer (Figure 11). As further shown in Figure 11, the test pharmaceutical composition demonstrated a comparable release rate in a pH 6.8 buffer compared to a reference pharmaceutical composition comprising oxycodone. The test pharmaceutical composition further displayed a lower release rate after about 15 minutes under boiling conditions in distilled water compared to a reference pharmaceutical composition comprising oxycodone (Figure 12). The test pharmaceutical composition comprising the abuse deterrent matrix of Table 10 comprising oxycodone demonstrated a lower release rate under boiling conditions compared to a reference pharmaceutical composition comprising oxycodone (Figure 13). Example 4 The effects of differing compositions of wax were determined to affect the release rate of oxycodone from the test pharmaceutical composition comprising the abuse deterrent matricis shown in Tables 12-13. As shown in Figure 14, the test pharmaceutical composition of Table 13, wherein carnauba wax was removed, demonstrated an increased release rate of 40 mg of oxycodone from the matrix when compared to a reference pharmaceutical composition comprising oxycodone. This, for example, is in contrast to the composition of Table 9, which comprises both carnauba wax and bee's wax and demonstrates a lower release rate compared to the same reference pharmaceutical composition comprising oxycodone (Figure 13). As shown in Figure 15, the test pharmaceutical composition of Table 13, wherein the amount of bee's wax was increased, led to a decreased release rate of oxycodone compared to the reference pharmaceutical composition comprising oxycodone only at a 40 mg dose and not at the 10 mg dose, suggesting higher concentrations of bee's wax or the addition of carnauba wax is also stabilizing to the abuse deterrent matrix under higher boiling temperatures. Example 5 Additional exemplary gel mass compositions useful for producing abuse deterrent controlled release soft gel capsules as described herein are shown in Tables 17-20. Composition components are set forth by weight percentage of the total weight of the gel mass composition. Such compositions may be encapsulated in soft capsules, enteric soft capsules, hard capsules or enteric hard capsules.
