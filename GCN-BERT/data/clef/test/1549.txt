FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is concerned with small functionalised amide molecules that exhibit antifouling and/or antibacterial activity and their use in the control of bacterial films and organism growth in the marine environment. BACKGROUND Marine fouling refers to the settlement and growth of organisms on submerged, manufactured surfaces and has been has been a problem since the dawn of maritime history. Colonization of submerged surfaces by marine organisms occurs within days to weeks of the surface entering the marine environment and, given the ever-increasing presence of maritime structures (underwater cables, generators, pipelines etc), the battle against fouling organisms is becoming an increasingly significant challenge. The need for effective methods to control marine fouling is of paramount importance to the international shipping industry. Antifouling coatings prevent the settlement of marine organisms, generally by killing larval foulers through the action of broad spectrum biocides such as organotin or copper compounds. Although extremely effective, environmental degradation resulting from the use of organotin compounds was so severe that marine paint companies voluntarily withdrew these paints from the market in 2003, and the IMO banned their use in 2008 (International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships, entered into force 17 Sep. 2008). Although copper and biocide booster containing paints are still widely available, their use is not desirable since they have the potential to accumulate in the marine environment (Voulvoulis, 2006). Current commercial marine coatings can be divided into two classes: antifouling and foul-release. Antifouling coatings use broad-spectrum biocides which kill foulers by oxidation or, more usually, exposure to toxic metal ions. Foul-release coatings are mainly silicon based polymers that are easy to clean, however the best of these usually also contain additives and catalysts that kill organisms. As noted above, legislation and agreements, based on the recognition of the environmentally unacceptable consequences of toxic antifouling agents such as tributyl tin in coatings, have prompted interest to develop new less environmentally pernicious coatings. An approach reported by Teo et al (an inventor of the present application) in U.S. Ser. No. 11/265,833, is the use of pharmaceuticals as antifouling agents. It has been demonstrated that pharmaceuticals may disrupt the metamorphosis of fouling organisms. Commercially available pharmaceuticals, with their known synthesis, chemical properties and primary mechanism of action in vertebrates and in humans, were screened as potential sources of antifouling agents. Whilst eight pharmaceuticals with promising bioactivity were reported, there remains the problem that these pharmaceuticals may accumulate in the marine environment. Furthermore, some of these pharmaceuticals suffer from delivery problems because of poor solubility in sea water. A further alternative to broad spectrum biocides is small, biodegradable organic molecules that inhibit the settlement of marine organisms. Such molecules should not be recalcitrant in the environment and should be “benign by design”. To this end, Teo et al recently demonstrated the antifouling potential of a family of simple α,α-disubstituted amides (selected examples shown below) on larval barnacles and bacterial biofilms (PCT/SG2009/000175). These molecules are predicted to breakdown rapidly in the marine environment. Numerous organic biocides have been used as additives into tin-free paints, however, the direct incorporation of small molecules into coating systems presents a number of issues. First, the release of the organic antifoulants must be sustained for several years in order to minimize the requirement for repainting of the vessel prior to scheduled dry-docking. In addition, many currently employed organic antifoulants are toxic to marine foulers, which, with increased use could have an unfavorable impact on the marine ecosystem in the event of accumulation. The physical properties of the organic antifoulants can also have a profound impact on the integrity of a commercially available coating system, which in the absence of metal-based binders may require reformulation of coating systems. Crucially, the mechanism by which the small molecule is incorporated into the coating system should permit retention of the activity of the small molecule. It is to be expected that structural modifications of the small molecule to impact on activity so that incorporating any active molecule into a coating system would be challenging. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have sought to address the problem of providing an environmentally benign biocide that is suitable for incorporation into coating systems, and coating systems including such biocides. At its most general, the present invention proposes that certain aryl-containing α,α-disubstituted amides should be provided with one or more selected substituents on the aryl, which substituents are suitable for attachment to a component, e.g. a polymer, of a coating composition. Surprisingly, amide compounds modified in this particular way retain useful activity. In particular, derivatives of the small molecule antifouling additives described in PCT/SG2009/000175 are disclosed herein, which derivatives possess functionality that enables covalent attachment to, for example, self-polishing coating systems. The ability to covalently link additives to an existing coating system has potential to facilitate their controlled release, thus extending coating lifetime and enhancing antifouling properties. Further work has identified structural modifications that permit a stable bond to coating systems without significantly compromising biological potency, thereby enabling the release of bioactive molecules via pre-existing release chemistry. In particular, the present application describes the synthesis and biological testing of a range of α-aryl amides bearing functionality to serve as a point of attachment to a marine coating system. A number of molecules are described which retain desirable antifouling properties (high potency against barnacle cyprid settlement yet low toxicity), while including ester or ether linkages that will enable covalent attachment to existing coating systems. Compounds The present invention pertains generally to a class of compounds referred to herein as “antifouling amide compounds”, which compounds have the following general α,α-disubstituted structure: wherein one or both of RA and RB is an aryl and wherein RC and RD independently represent optionally substituted alkyl or together form a ring. The present invention proposes that the aryl group of one or both of RA and RB of such compounds should be functionalised with one or more groups tailored to permit connection to coating systems (e.g. a polymer). Furthermore, the present invention proposes that such compounds having an aryl substituent that is a product of the cleavage of such a group from a coating system (e.g. a polymer) can retain useful activity. The present invention pertains to such antifouling amide compounds, which exhibit biocidal or biostatic properties. Therefore, the antifouling amide compounds may also be referred to as “biocidal compounds” or “biostatic compounds”. Embodiments of the invention have the potential to enhance antifouling properties of existing marine coating systems. In particular, embodiments preferably have one or more of the following advantages: highly potent against barnacle settlement, low toxicity and are likely to degrade rapidly in the marine environment (environmentally benign). Substitution of the aryl group with different functional groups can be employed as a point of attachment to tailor properties for different coatings and for different applications. An advantage of this system lies in the potential to incorporate these molecules into an existing coating system and the release of the antifoulant will be directly linked to the lifetime of the coating. In a first aspect the present invention provides a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof: wherein each of R1 and R2 is independently selected from (A) aryl substituted with at least one of OH, RS1OH, ORS2, RS1ORS2, OC(O)H, OC(O)RS2, RS1OC(O)H, RS1OC(O)RS2, C(O)OH, C(O)ORS2, RS1C(O)OH, RS1C(O)ORS2, ORS1OH, ORS1ORS2, ORS1OC(O)H, ORS1OC(O)RS2, ORS1C(O)OH and ORS1C(O)ORS2, wherein, if present, each RS1 is independently optionally substituted C1 to C5 alkylene, andwherein, if present, each RS2 is independently selected from optionally substituted C1 to C5 alkyl, C2 to C5 alkenyl and C1 to C5 silyl-C1 to C5 alkylene.and(B) optionally substituted C3 to C12 alkylwith the proviso that at least one of R1 and R2 (A); and each of R3 and R4 are independently optionally substituted C1 to C6 alkyl, or R3 and R4 together form an optionally substituted 5 to 12-membered heterocycle which incorporates the nitrogen to which they are attached. Whilst it is possible for both R1 and R2 to be (A), i.e. aryl, it is preferred that one of R1 and R2 is (B), i.e. C3 to C12 alkyl. As described herein, C3 to C12 alkyl includes saturated and unsaturated, branched and unbranched C3 to C12 alkyl. In some preferred embodiments, the alkyl is unsaturated alkyl. In particular, preferably at least one of R1 and R2 is unsaturated C3 to C12 alkyl, preferably unsaturated C3 to C10 alkyl, preferably unsaturated C3 to C8 alkyl and most preferably unsaturated C3 to C6 alkyl.

In embodiments at least one of R1 and R2 is C4 alkyl, more preferably n-butyl.

Examples of such groups include, but are not limited to, —CH2OH, —CH2CH2OH, and —CH(OH)CH2OH. Hydrogen: —H. Note that if the substituent at a particular position is hydrogen, it may be convenient to refer to the compound or group as being “unsubstituted” at that position. Aryl: The term “aryl,” as used herein, pertains to a monovalent moiety obtained by removing a hydrogen atom from an aromatic ring atom of an aromatic compound, which moiety has from 3 to 20 ring atoms (unless otherwise specified). Preferably, each ring has from 5 to 7 ring atoms.

Other Terms As used herein, the term “fouling” refers to the attachment and growth of microorganisms and small organisms to a substrate exposed to, or immersed in, a liquid medium, for example an aqueous medium, as well as to an increase in number of the microorganisms and/or small organisms in a container of the liquid medium. Accordingly “foulers” or “microfoulers” are used interchangeably and refer to the organisms that foul a substrate. Fouling may occur in structures exposed to or immersed in fresh water as well as in sea water. In particular, the term may be used to refer to a solid medium or substrate exposed to, or immersed in sea water. Accordingly, the term “antifouling” refers to the effect of preventing, reducing and/or eliminating fouling. Antifouling agents or compounds are also called “antifoulants”. An antifoulant compound is usually applied at a standard concentration which is the concentration that is effective for its purpose. Accordingly, a concentration less than or below the standard concentration is one where the antifoulant is not effective when it is used alone. The term “substrate” as used herein refers to a solid medium such as surfaces of structures or vessels exposed to, or immersed in a liquid medium. The liquid medium may be fresh water or seawater and may be a body of water in a manmade container such as a bottle, pool or tank, or the liquid may be uncontained by any manmade container such as seawater in the open sea. A “structure” as used herein refers to natural geological or manmade structures such as piers or oil rigs and the term “vessel” refers to manmade vehicles used in water such as boats and ships. The “microorganisms” referred to herein include viruses, bacteria, fungi, algae and protozoans. “Small organisms” referred to herein can include organisms that commonly foul substrates exposed to, or immersed in, fresh water or seawater such as crustaceans, bryozoans and molluscs, particularly those that adhere to a substrate. Examples of such small organisms include barnacles and mussels and their larvae. Small organisms can also be called small animals. The term “organism” referred to herein is to be understood accordingly and includes microorganisms and small organisms. The term “marine organism” as used herein refers to organisms whose natural habitat is sea water. The terms “marine microorganism” and “marine small organism” are to be understood accordingly. Further, the term “microfouling” refers to fouling by microorganisMs and the term “macrofouling” refers to fouling by organisms larger than microorganisms such as small organisms defined above. The terms “biocide” or “biocidal compound” refer to compounds that inhibit the growth of microorganisms and small organisms by killing them. The terms “biostatic” or “biostatic compound” refer to compounds that inhibit the growth of microorganisms or small organisms by preventing them from reproducing and not necessarily by killing them. The term “degradation” as used herein refers to the chemical breakdown or modification of a compound in water, preferably sea water. The term “growth” as used herein refers to both the increase in number of microorganisms and small organisms, as well to the development of a small organism from juvenile to adult stages. Accordingly, biocides and biostatics can be applied as a treatment to a body of liquid or to a substrate surface to inhibit the growth of microorganisms and small organisms. As such, biocides and biostatics can be antifoulants and can prevent, reduce or eliminate biofilm formation. Accordingly, the terms “bacteriocidal” and “bacteriostatic” refer to effects of compounds on bacteria. The term “bioactivity” as used herein refers to the effect of a given agent or compound, such as a biocidal or biostatic compound, on a living organism, particularly on microorganisms or small organisms. A “biofilm” is a complex aggregation of microorganisms, usually bacteria or fungi, marked by the excretion of a protective and adhesive matrix. Biofilms are also often characterized by surface attachment, structural heterogeneity, genetic diversity, complex community interactions, and an extracellular matrix of polymeric substances. Biofilms may also be more resistant to antibiotics compared to unaggregated bacteria due to the presence of the matrix. The term “pharmaceutical” as it relates to a use, agent, compound or composition, refers to the medical treatment of a disease or disorder in humans or animals. Accordingly, a pharmaceutical compound is a compound used for the medical treatment of a disease or disorder in humans or animals. As used herein, the term “standard concentration” as it pertains to an anti-fouling agent or compound, refers to the concentration at which the agent or compound is effective against microorganisms or small organisms at which it are directed when that agent or compound is used alone. Accordingly, the term “effective” means having a desired effect and the term “below standard concentration” refers to the level at which the agent or compound is not effective when used alone. Examples Part 1—Compounds Synthesis of Compounds Several methods for the chemical synthesis of compounds of the present invention are described herein. These and/or other well known methods may be modified and/or adapted in known ways in order to facilitate the synthesis of additional compounds within the scope of the present invention. The amides may be prepared according to the following general methodologies Method A The synthesis of alkoxylated substituted compounds such as the 15-series compounds is based on a two step protocol in which commercially available phenylacetic acid derivatives undergo DCC mediated amide formation with piperidine (Scheme 1). Subsequent alkylation of the resultant 2-arylacetamides then proceeds upon treatment with LDA and bromobutane under standard conditions. The same methodology was also adopted for the dialkyl amides. Thus, the synthesis of the methoxy- and hydroxyaryl congeners of the unsubstituted parent compound is based on a three or four step protocol in which commercially available phenylacetic acid derivatives are first converted to either the piperidine or dimethyl amides via the corresponding acid chlorides or benzotriazolyl esters. Subsequent LDA promoted alkylation with either 1-bromobutane or 6-bromo-1-hexene affords the desired methoxyaryl compounds in low to good yields as shown in Scheme 1.1. Demethylation of selected methoxyaryl targets was performed using boron tribromide in dichloromethane as outlined in Scheme 1.2. Treatment of 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 and 17.2 under these conditions all proceeded smoothly to afford the corresponding hydroxyaryl derivatives in good yield and in high purity. Method B The synthesis of hydroxymethylated compounds and acetylated analogues were accessed from the readily synthesized amides following standard protection and alkylation protocols (Scheme 2). Acetylation of the p-derivative afforded compounds in good isolated yield. More specifically, in order to gain access the hydroxymethylated congeners of 12.1 and their acetate derivatives, it was necessary to use different synthetic routes based on the commercial availability of the phenylacetic acid derivatives. Whilst p-hydroxymethylphenylacetic acid is commercially available and was able to be used directly in a coupling reaction with piperidine, the corresponding o-hydroxymethylphenylacetic acid was not commercially available. Hence the requisite amide was accessed by nucleophilic ring opening of commercially available isochromanone with piperidine in moderate isolated yield (Scheme 2.1 below). With the o- and p-hydroxymethylamides in hand, treatment with tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) chloride in the presence of imidazole afforded the corresponding TBS ethers in moderate yield and these underwent alkylation to furnish 16.1 and 16.2 in their protected form. Treatment of the TBS ethers with TBAF in THF resulted in removal of the TBS protecting group to afford 16.1 and 16.2 in near quantitative yields. Compound 16.3 was then isolated following treatment of 16.2 with acetic anhydride in pyridine. This is shown in Scheme 2.1 below, being a modified version of Scheme 2. The procedure to convert 16.2 directly to 17.9 was a two step process whereby Swern oxidation to the corresponding aldehyde was performed prior to treatment with Oxone®. The desired acid was obtained in moderate overall yield (Scheme 3). The remaining targeted congeners of 12.1 could all be accessed by modification of 16.5 by treatment with an appropriate electrophile. In all cases the target compounds were obtained in moderate to excellent yield. A summary of these reactions are shown in Scheme 4.

Synthesis Methods and Data for Selected Amide Derivatives Characterisation Proton (1H) and carbon (13C) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker NMR spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for 1H and 75.4 MHz for 13C. Deuterochloroform (CDCl3) was used as the solvent unless otherwise indicated. Chemical shifts (d) are reported as the shift in parts per million (ppm) from tetramethylsilane (TMS, 0.00 ppm). NMR spectra recorded in CDCl3 were referenced to the residual chloroform singlet (7.26 ppm) for 1H, and the central peak of the CDCl3 triplet (77.00 ppm) for 13C. 1H NMR spectroscopic data are reported as follows: chemical shift (δ), multiplicity (s: singlet, d: doublet, t: triplet, q: quartet, qt: quintet, m: multiplet, dd; doublet of doublets, etc., br: broad), coupling constant (J Hz,) and relative integral (number of protons). 13C spectroscopic data are reported as chemical shift (δ) and assignment where possible. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Bio-rad Excalibur Series TFS 3000MX FTIR. Samples were run as thin liquid films on NaCl plates. IR spectral data is reported as follows: frequency (νmax cm−1), strength (vs: very strong, s: strong, m: medium, w: weak). High resolution El mass spectra were recorded on a Thermo Finnigan MAT XP95 mass spectrometer. Analytical thin layer chromatography (tlc) was conducted on aluminium sheets coated with silica gel F254 (Merck). The chromatograms were analysed at a wavelength of 254 nm (where appropriate) and/or developed using an acidic solution (5% H2SO4) of potassium permanganate in water followed by heating. All solvents used were of AR grade and purified by literature procedures where appropriate (Armarego, 2003). General Procedure—DCC Mediated Amide Bond Formation To a cooled (0° C.) stirred solution of phenylacetic acid derivative (1 equiv.) in DMF (1.2 mL/mmol) was added DCC (1.1 equiv.) and HOBt (1.1 equiv.). The resulting mixture was allowed to stir for 1 hour, by which time a heavy colourless precipitate was evident. Piperidine (1.1 equiv.) was added to the reaction mixture and stirring was continued for a further two hours, after which time the reaction mixture was filtered. The mother liquor was taken up in EtOAc and washed successively with saturated NaHCO3 and water (×3, 2.4 mL/mmol). The organic layer was dried (MgSO4) and concentrated in vacuo to afford the crude amides, which were purified by flash column chromatography using the solvent systems specified. General Procedure—Amide Bond Formation Via Acid Chlorides To a cooled (0° C.) stirred solution of methoxyphenylacetic acid in DCM (0.4 mL mmol−1) was added thionyl chloride (0.4 mL mmol−1). The resulting mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and was heated at 50° C. for 2 hours after which time the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and carefully poured onto ice. The organic layer was dried (MgSO4) and concentrated in vacuo to afford the desired acid chloride which was used without further purification. For piperidine amides, the appropriate amount of acid chloride (1 mol. equiv.) was dissolved in an equal amount of dry CH2Cl2 and added slowly to a cooled (0° C.) solution of piperidine (2 mol. equiv.) in CH2Cl2 (1 mL mmol−1). The resulting mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for a further two hours. The crude reaction mixture was washed with water and the organic layer dried (MgSO4) and concentrated in vacuo to afford the desired amide. No further purification was necessary. For dimethyl amides, the appropriate amount of acid chloride was slowly added to cooled (0° C.) 40% solution of dimethylamine in water (10 mol. equiv.) and stirred for 2 hours after warming to room temperature. CH2Cl2 was added to the reaction mixture and the organic layer was washed with water, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated in vacuo to afford the desired amide. General Procedure—α-Alkylation To a cooled (−78° C.) stirred solution of freshly distilled diisopropylamide (1 equiv.) in dry THF (2 mL/mmol) was added n-butyllithium in hexanes (1 equiv). The resulting reaction mixture became pale yellow and was stirred for 10-15 minutes at −78° C. prior to the careful addition of the desired amide (0.95 equiv.). The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 hour at which point bromobutane (1 equiv.) was added. The resulting mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature over a number of hours (at least 3) and continued stirring for a further 13 hours (16 hours in total). The reaction was quenched by the careful dropwise addition of water to the reaction mixture. Following this, water was added to the reaction mixture and the aqueous phase removed. The organic layer was washed with water followed by brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification was carried out by flash column chromatography using the solvent systems specified.

Examples Part 2—Polymer Systems A number of polymers were synthesised, which polymers included a pendant group corresponding to antifouling compound 16.5. Specifically, compound 16.5 was incorporated into acrylate based polymers via the use of monomer 16.11. The polymers were evaluated with respect to their ability to release (active) compound 16.5 in an aqueous environment in a sustained fashion. In particular, the antifouling efficacy of polymeric materials was studied in laboratory and field assays to identify anti-fouling performance and toxicity. Synthesis of Polymers The same polymers were designed and synthesized as the embodiments to illustrate the potential applications of our invention in marine coatings. But no limitations should be drawn from those embodiments. Polymers containing compound 16.5 as a releasable functional unit were designed with moderately hydrophilic (to ensure hydration in water) and to possess suitable strength, solubility and compatibility with commercial marine paints. To fulfil these requirements, the Tg of the polymer should preferably be higher than room temperature and the molecular weight is targeted to be approximately 10 KDaltons. Such polymers were synthesized by the polymerization of vinyl-containing compound 16.11 with the appropriate vinyl monomers under free radical conditions using AIBN, ABCN or benzoyl peroxide as initiators. Polymer A P(16.11-co-MMA-co-HEA) The copolymer of compound 16.11 with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) was designed to obtain the functional polymer. Thus 16.11, methyl methacrylate (MMA) and (HEA) were mixed and polymerized under standard free radical conditions. The mass ratio was designed so that MMA would form the majority of the backbone of the polymer, imparting mechanical strength and ensuring a Tg higher than room temperature, whilst HEA would provide hydrogen bonding capabilities which can improve the hydrophilicity of the polymer. 0.54 g of the functional monomer (16.11) (heavy viscose oil-like yellow liquid) was mixed with 2.0 g of MMA, 1.0 g of 2-hydroxylethyl acrylate (HEA) and 40 mg of ABCN in 3 ml of DMF. The mixture was degassed by purging with nitrogen for 10 min. and then placed into an oil bath thermosetted at 70° C. for 16 hours. Following this, the reaction mixture was poured into 50 mL of ether. The precipitate was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum at room temperature to afford the title compounds as a colourless solid (2.5 g, 74%). Analysis of the polymeric material by IR spectroscopy revealed the expected ester C═O stretching absorbances at ˜1730 cm−1 along with a key absorbance detected at 1621 cm−1. Such low frequency C═O vibrations are characteristic of tertiary amides, and therefore this band is assigned to the piperidine amide linkage of the polymerized 16.11. Polymer B P(16.11-co-MMA-co-VP) Polymer B was of a similar design to polymer A but vinyl pyrrolidinone (VP) was used in the place of HEA in order to increase the hydrophilicity of the polymer. Polymer B was synthesized under free radical conditions using the same monomer ratios as that described for polymer A. The structure of polymer B is shown below. 0.5 g of the functional monomer was mixed with 2.0 g of MMA, 1.0 g of vinyl pyrrolidone (VP) and 40 mg of ABCN in 3 ml of DMF and the mixture was degassed by purging with nitrogen for 10 min. Then the mixture was placed into an oil bath thermosetted at 70° C. for 16 hours. Then to the product was added 5 ml of DCM to form a clear solution. The solution was poured into hexane with stirring. The purified product was collected as a white precipitate. The pure product was collected and dried in air at room temperature to afford the title compound as a colourless solid (1.9 g, 54%). Analysis of the polymer by IR spectroscopy revealed the expected ester carbonyl stretching absorbances at ˜1724 cm−1 along with the previously assigned piperidine amide carbonyl vibration at ˜1640 cm−1. The incorporation of VP is evident by IR spectroscopy with a clear absorbance appearing at ˜1660 cm−1, consistent with the presence of the γ-lactam. GPC revealed a MW of 5300 Daltons. Finally, the soluble nature of the polymer allowed further analysis by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Signals at 6.9-7.2 ppm are assigned to the phenyl moiety of the 16.11 units, whilst the broad peak at 4.0 ppm to 4.3 ppm was assigned to ring methylene adjacent to the N-atom of the pyrrolidinone unit. Large broad signals in the 3.5-3.8 ppm are assigned to the methyl ester of the MMA units (Brar and Kumar, 2002). The signals at 0.9 ppm-2.5 ppm are ascribed to the methylene and methine groups of the polymer backbone and the methylene and methyl groups of side chain of 16.11. Polymer C P(TBA-co-MMA-co-VP) A standard co-polymer (polymer C) was also synthesized where 16.11 was replaced with t-butyl acrylate (TBA). Such a polymer was synthesised in order to ascertain if any background toxicity or anti-settlement activity existed as a function of the copolymer itself. The free radical polymerization was carried out using the same mass ratios as for polymers A and B. 0.6 g of tert-butyl acrylate was mixed with 2.0 g of MMA, 1.0 g of vinyl pyrrolidone (VP) and 40 mg of ABCN in 3 ml of DMF and the mixture was degassed by purging with nitrogen for 10 min. Then the mixture was placed into an oil bath thermosetted at 70° C. for 16 hours. Then to the product was added 5 ml of DCM to form a clear solution. The solution was poured into hexane with stirring. The purified product was collected as a white precipitate. The pure product was collected and dried in air at room temperature to afford the desired compound as a colourless solid (3.2 g, 89%) Analysis of the polymer by IR spectroscopy revealed the presence of key vibrational modes ester and lactam carbonyl groups at 1728 cm−1 and 1664 cm−1. GPC indicated the desired MW of 67000 Daltons had been achieved and this was much higher than that obtained for polymer B. 1H NMR analysis of the polymer confirmed the presence of the t-butyl moiety in the polymer, appearing at 1.4 ppm. Examples Part 3—Biological Investigation of Compounds Methodology Biological assays were conducted with larval barnacles. Barnacles are dominant and tenacious members of marine fouling communities, and often serve as a substrate for less resistant organisms. Therefore, historically they have been used as a model organism for antifouling studies. To determine the biological response of larvae to test compounds, two bioassays were performed: settlement (using settlement stage cyprids), and toxicity (using nauplii). Procedures followed methods standard in the field, which were first described by Rittschof et al. (1992). Preparation of stock solution for bioassays Stock solutions of each compound were made at 50 mg/ml. Pure compounds were diluted in DMSO and sonicated. Stock solutions were stored at −20° C. in 4 ml amber screw cap vials until use. For bioassays, a small amount of stock solution was diluted in 1 μm filtered seawater (in a glass scintillation vial). The solution was then sonicated for 10 minutes. To obtain the desired concentration range, serial dilutions of the test solution were made. As control, a serial dilution of the equivalent amounts of DMSO in seawater was used. Toxicity Assays Toxicity assays employed stage II naupliar larvae of the barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite (previously Balanus amphitrite: Pitombo, 2004). Assay procedures were modified from Rittschof et al. (1992). Adult A. amphitrite were collected from inter-tidal areas near the Kranji mangrove, Singapore. Larval culture was based on Rittschof et al. (1984). Following collection, nauplii were concentrated for use in bioassays by placing a fiber optic light source at one side of the container, and pipetting from the resulting dense cloud of nauplii. In order to determine LD50 values for each compound, compounds were tested over a range of concentrations between 0-50 μg/ml. For each assay, each compound at each concentration was tested in triplicate with a single batch of nauplii. The overall assay was conducted twice, using two different batches of nauplii. Two controls were run along with each assay (in triplicate): filtered seawater only, and DMSO at 1 μg/ml (since DMSO was used as a solvent for test compounds, this concentration is equivalent to the concentration of DMSO in the highest test compound concentration). For assays, approximately 20 nauplii (in 50 μl filtered seawater) were added to 1 ml test solution or control, in a 2 ml glass vial (La Pha Pack® PN 11-14-0544). Assays were run for 22-24 hours at 25-27° C. After this time, living and dead nauplii were counted using a Bogorov tray. Nauplii that were approaching death were scored as dead. Data for all assays was combined and LD50 was calculated (where possible) using a probit analysis (Libermann, 1983). If LD50 could not be calculated using probit analysis, values were extrapolated based on plotted data. Settlement Assays Settlement assays (using barnacle cyprids) were based on methodology described in Rittschof et al. (1992). Nauplii were cultured as described above, and then reared at 25° C. on an algal mixture of 1:1 v/v of Tetraselmis suecica and Chaetoceros muelleri (approximately density 5×105 cells per ml). Under these conditions, nauplii typically metamorphose to cyprids in 5 days. Cyprids were aged at 4° C. for 2 days. Settlement in filtered seawater controls after aging is generally 45-70%. Settlement assays were conducted in 7 ml neutral glass vials (Samco® T103/V1; 34×23 mm diameter). For assays, each solution was made at twice the desired final concentration; 0.5 ml of this solution was transferred to vials. To each vial, cyprids were added by transferring 0.5 ml filtered seawater containing 20-40 aged cyprids. As in toxicity assays: each compound at each concentration was run in triplicate with cyprids from a single batch; two controls (filtered seawater and DMSO) were run along with each assays; and the overall assay was conducted twice, using two different batches of cyprids. Assays were conducted for 24 hours, after which time the number of settled cyprids, the number of free swimming (unsettled) cyprids, and the number of dead cyprids were counted for each vial. Both metamorphosed, juvenile barnacles and cyprids that had committed to settlement (glued themselves to the vial), but had not yet metamorphosed, were counted as ‘settled’. Data was expressed as percent settlement. Data for all assays was combined and ED50 (the concentration that caused a 50% reduction in settlement as compared to controls) was calculated (where possible) using a probit analysis (Libermann, 1983). If ED50 could not be calculated using probit analysis, values were extrapolated based on plotted data. Results Biological activity for the compounds is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Data is from assays with batches of larvae, and three replicates of each compound per batch. Where LD50 or ED50 could not be calculated using probit analysis, values were estimated from plotted data. Compounds with a high LD50 value (low toxicity), but low ED50 (highly potency) are most desirable for anti-fouling purposes. A number of the tested compounds show a therapeutic ratio equal to, or greater than previously identified non-functionalised compounds (12.1 and 12.2; PCT/SG2009/000175) TABLE 1 Biological activity.

Biological screening therefore indicates that functionalized molecules retained or improve upon desirable biological activity (high potency against barnacle cyprid settlement, yet low toxicity). Compounds with a high LD50 value (low toxicity), but low ED50 (highly potency) are most desirable for anti-fouling purposes. All the compounds gave therapeutic ratios greater than 1. The above results demonstrate that these new small organic molecules can be used as environmentally benign antifouling additives. These molecules retain effective anti-settlement activity despite differing substituents and substitution patterns on the aromatic ring. Indeed, a number of the compounds display bioactivity comparable to, or better than that of the unsubstituted parent structure. These new molecules improve upon the parent structure in that they can support functionality which can be used to tether or anchor the antifouling compounds to a marine coating system. The compounds can be blended into existing acrylate paints and are therefore practical alternatives to the current coating options. Furthermore, due to their simple structure the compounds are attractive candidates for degradation via bacterial means in the marine environment and are less likely to accumulate and pose a health risk in the future. In addition, given that existing organic biocides such as Diuron® and Sea-Nine® have been shown to bioaccumulate and cause detrimental effects in the marine environment, the compounds of the present invention represent a valuable alternative to traditional metal-based additives. Examples Part 4—Polymeric Systems Release Studies Preparation of Multiwell Plates for Laboratory Assays Two batches of polystyrene 4×6 multiwell plates (base of the well 2 cm2) were prepared for laboratory assays. A stock solution of polymer was made by dissolving 50 mg of P(MMA-co-16.11-co-VP) in 1.0 ml of ethanol. The plates were coated with the desired amount of the stock solution (10 μL, 20 μL, 30 μL, 40 μL, 50 μL and 70 μL) and placed in air at 27° C. for 6 hours. Then deionised water was added into those wells. After 24 hours the water was removed completely from the wells and stored for further analysis. The polystyrene plates were then dried under a stream of dry air. Meanwhile, the control specimens were prepared in the same way without water soaking. Settlement Assay The coatings were tested for antifouling effects using barnacle cyprid settlement assays. Cyprids were cultured as described above. After 5 days, cyprids were obtained and they were aged at 4° C. for 2 days before the settlement experiment. For experiment, cyprids were added by transferring 1 ml filtered seawater containing 20-40 aged cyprids into each well. The multi-well plates were incubated for 24 hours, after which time the number of settled cyprids, the number of free swimming (unsettled) cyprids, and the number of dead cyprids were counted for each well. The result of the assay is given in FIG. 1. For all treatments, cyprid mortality was less than 10%. Settlement on the control coating, P(MMA-co-tBA-co-VP), was similar to that for uncoated polystyrene. Wells coated with P(MMA-co-16.11-co-VP) showed reduction in cyprid settlement, with no settlement observed for treatments >40 μl. Quantification by HPLC Aliquots of solutions obtained after soaking for 24 hours were mixed with a known volume of the internal standard and directly injected into a HPLC system and monitored at 226 nm. The amount of 16.5 released into the solutions obtained after soaking are shown below in Table 3 along with the calculated release rate. In each case, the amount of 16.5 released falls in a very narrow range (0.15-0.45 μg), representing the similar surface area exposed to the aqueous environment in each case, regardless of the quantity of polymer. TABLE 3 Mass released and calculated release rates of 16.5 released from coated wells after 24 hours.

P(MMA-co-tBA-co-VP) was applied as the control coating. Settlement on this coating was similar to that for uncoated polystyrene. Increased amounts of P(MMA-co-16.11-co-VP resulted in decline in barnacle settlement, with no settlement for test treatments >40 μl. In all treatments, cyprid mortality was less than 10%. Following successful release of active compound 16.5 from the polymer, analysis was carried out into the hydrolysis of compound 16.11 from the polymer to release compound 16.5 into solution. Preparation of Coated Vials for Laboratory Analysis The inner base of glass vials with an internal diameter of 12 mm was matted with coarse sandpaper and then inoculated with a stock solution of P(MMA-co-16.11-co-VP) in ethanol such that the quantity of copolymer present is 500 μg and 2500 μg of P(MMA-co-16.11-co-VP) respectively, covering a surface area of 1.13 cm2. The vials were allowed to cure overnight prior to the addition of 2 mL of deionised water was added to each well. After 24 hours, the water was removed and replaced by 2 mL of fresh deionised water. The process was repeated after a further 24 hours and again for a further 48 hours giving a time course of 1, 2 and 4 days. Aliquots of the collected solutions were run against an internal standard (phenol), monitoring the response ratio at 226 nm. The resulting mass of 16.5 released at the specified time points are shown in Table 4. In each case the presence of 16.5 in the water was confirmed by analysis of the aliquots by analytical HPLC— ESI. TABLE 4 Mass of 16.5 released from polymer coated vials after 24 hours Mass of P(MMA-co- 16.11-co-VP) Mass of 16.5 released (μg) coating Day 1 Day 2 Day 3-4 Day 5-7 500 μg 0.482 0.0064 0.046 0.0054 0.572 0.0022 0.039 0.0086 0.534 0.0018 0.083 0.0096 2500 μg 0.067 0.0042 0.0031 0.0263 0.034 0.0051 0.0013 0.0233 0.050 0.0091 0.0053 0.0350 The average release rates for the first four days are shown in Table 5. The strikingly different release rates of the 500 μg and 2500 μg coated vials on day 1 (0.468 μg cm2 day−1 and 0.045 μg cm2 day−1 respectively) reflect the different surface roughness of the coatings at the start of the release studies. After day 1 it can be seen that the release rates converge and this level of release is sustained at similar levels over the next 6 days.
