Field The present invention relates to surface coating compositions for use in coating substrates, and more particularly to ultraviolet curable coatings for flooring and other applications. Background Radiation curable coatings, such as UV curable coatings, are applied to various types of substrates to enhance their durability and finish. These radiation curable coatings are typically mixtures of resins, including oligomers and monomers that are radiation curable after being applied to the substrate. The radiation curing polymerizes and/or cross-links the resins to produce high or low gloss coatings. Radiation curable coatings are used in a wide variety of flooring applications, such as on linoleum, hardwood, resilient sheet, and tile flooring. While conventional coatings provide some protection to the substrate, these coatings are prone to damage from heat exposure, cleaning chemicals and ordinary wear-and-tear causing the appearance of the floor to become less desirable. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a coating which exhibits improved stain resistance, heat-exposure resistance, and scratch resistance. Embodiments of the present invention are directed to these and other ends.

Without being bound by theory, it is believed that in some embodiments, the combination of a UV curable urethane or acrylate having one or more phosphate ester moieties and a silicone acrylate contributes to the improved stain resistance, scratch resistance and heat-exposure resistance demonstrated by the coatings of the present invention. While in other embodiments, it may be the combination of a UV curable curable urethane or acrylate having one or more phosphate ester moieties, a silicone acrylate and a fluoropolymer that contributes to the improved stain resistance, scratch resistance and heat-exposure resistance demonstrated by the coatings of the present invention. While in other embodiments, it may be the combination of a UV curable urethane or acrylate having one or more phosphate ester moieties and a fluoropolymer that contributes to the improved stain resistance, scratch resistance and heat-exposure resistance demonstrated by the coatings of the present invention. Specifically, the surface coating compositions of the present invention have demonstrated significantly improved resistance to iodine stains and oil-based ink stains when compared to commercially available surface coating compositions which do not comprise the inventive combination of components. In fact, when exposed to oil-based ink, the surface coating compositions of the present invention formed beads of the oil-based ink and only required dry tissue paper to remove the ink. In contrast, a commercially available surface coating which did not comprise the inventive combination of components required mechanical agitation using a rubber eraser to remove the oil-based ink. In some embodiments, the surface coating compositions of the present invention are able to resist stains caused by exposure to chemical, e.g. a strong acid (sulfuric acid), while commercial coatings used for similar applications - and which do not comprise the inventive combination of components - turned yellow and brown due to oxidation and corrosion by the sulfuric acid. In further embodiments, the surface coating compositions of the present invention are able to resist damage caused by exposure to heat to a greater extent than commercially available surface coating compositions which do not comprise the inventive combination of components (e.g. a UV curable urethane or acrylate having one or more phosphate ester moieties and a fluoropolymer). The invention will be described in greater detail by way of specific examples. The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize a variety of noncritical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results. Examples Example 1 Described in Table 1 (below) are two exemplary coating compositions of the present invention (I and II) and four comparative coating compositions (CI - CIII). These coatings were prepared by conventional means, readily understood by those skilled in the art.

Specifically, the coatings are applied to a vinyl sheet substrate having a PVC film laminated thereon and and fully cured with a UV lamp. Each coated substrate is exposed to 100 grit sandpaper in a Byk Gardner Abrasion Tester for thirty (30) cycles. Gloss measurements are taken prior to and after the 30 cycles are completed. Pre-exposure and post-exposure gloss readings are compared and a percentage gloss retention is calculated. The value of gloss retention may be higher than 100% since the gloss of the coated substrate may increase during the abrasion process. Table 2IIICICIICIII% Gloss Retention101.8109.968.367.581.8 Iodine Stain Test Two exemplary surface coating compositions of the present invention are evaluated against four comparative compositions for their ability to resistance non-aqueous based stains. A drop of iodine is applied to each coating and allowed to remain in place for one minute. The coatings are cleaned with water followed by acetone. The degree of yellowing is measured by use of a calorimeter that measures tristimulas color values of 'a', 'b', and 'L', where the color coordinates are designated as +a (red), -a (green), +b (yellow), -b (blue), +L (white), and -L (black). The degree of yellowing is expressed as Delta b (Δb) or difference in b values between the initial and final values. Table 3IIICICIICIIIΔb7.947.949.2512.827.35 As illustrated by the data described in Tables 2 and 3 (above), exemplary surface coatings of the present invention provide an unexpected combination of gloss retention and resistance to non-aqueous based stains. Example 3 Heat Resistance Test A vinyl sheet laminated with a PVC film is coated with the coating composition I of Example I and fully cured under a UV lamp (Example III), and a comparative example of the same laminated vinyl sheet is coated with a commercial coating composition available from Akzo Novel (UV Photoglaze™) and fully cured under a UV lamp (Example CIV). A Leister heat-welding hot air blower equipped with a welding tip is placed on the coated side of the sheets with a temperature setting that provided about 440°C. When the blower is removed from the sheet in 10 seconds, Example III has a faint yellowing of the coated surface around where the heat was exposed, while Example CIV has burned damage marks that are clearly visible. When the two samples are exposed with the same setting for 15 seconds, Example III exhibits some heat damage marks similar to Example CIV exposed to the heat for 10 seconds, while Example CIV exhibits a clearly visible round burn region of the size twice as large as the heating nozzle of the blower. Example 4 Chemical Resistance Test The chemical resistance of the coated sheet of Example III and commercial sheets available from LG, Tarkett, Gerflor and Dajulong is compared. Samples of the sheets are exposed to 90% sulfuric acid. When exposed to sulfuric acid, all of the commercial sheets exhibit clearly visual damages, including yellowing or browning of the top surface including the coated surface, while Example III does not exhibit any visible damages. Example 5 Stain Resistance Test The stain resistance of the coated sheet of Example III and commercial sheets available from LG, Tarkett, Gerflor and Dajulong is compared. Samples of the tiles are marked with a permanent marker (e.g., Sharpie™ permanent marker). When the permanent marker is applied on Example III, the ink from the marker beads up on the sample surface. When the ink is allowed to dry on the applied surface, the ink is easily removed merely by wiping with a tissue paper. In contrast, all of the commercial sheets have ink marks remained on the surface when wiped with a tissue paper.
