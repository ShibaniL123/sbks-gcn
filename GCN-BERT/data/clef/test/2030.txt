(Example 3) Synthesis of 3-Fluorofuroxan Compound
4-Fluoro-3-(4-methylphenyl)furoxan (51.7 mg, 0.23 mmol) was placed in a Pyrex (registered trademark) glass flask and 8 mL of benzene was added thereto. The mixture was degassed by ultrasonic wave for 1 minute while reducing the pressure to 50 mmHg. Under an argon atmosphere, the mixture was irradiated with light for 6 hours. Light having a wavelength of 300 to 400 nm was used. The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure and the obtained residue was purified by silica gel chromatography to obtain 3-fluoro-4-(4-methylphenyl)furoxan (37.6 mg, 73% yield).
