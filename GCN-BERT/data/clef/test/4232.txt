WO 2010 / 003658 describes some macrocyclic indoles that can be used as inhibitors of the hepatitis C virus. The synthesis of 13-cyclohexyl-3-methoxy-6-[methyl-(2-{2-[methyl-(sulphamoyl)-amino]-ethoxy}-ethyl)-carbamoyl]-7H-indolo-[2,1 -a]-[2]-benzazepine-10-carboxylic acid (Compound ‘A’) was described there on pages 38 and 39 (see Compound 1e) as a three-step synthesis, giving an overall yield of 62%. The aim of the present invention is to provide an improved method for the synthesis of 13-cyclohexyl-3-methoxy-6-[methyl-(2-{2-[methyl-(sulphamoyl)-amino]-ethoxy}-ethyl)-carbamoyl]-7H-indolo-[2,1-a]-[2]-benzazepine-10-carboxylic acid (Compound ‘A’) that is easier to carry out and is more efficient than the method known so far. The present invention achieves this aim by providing an improved method for the preparation of 13-cyclohexyl-3-methoxy-6-[methyl-(2-{2-[methyl-(sulphamoyl)-amino]-ethoxy}-ethyl)-carbamoyl]-7H-indolo-[2, 1 -a]-[2]-benzazepine- 10-carboxylic acid (‘Compound A’), characterized in that it comprises the following steps: a) 1 0-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-13-cyclohexyl-3-methoxy-7H-indolo-[2,1 -a]-[2]-benzazepine-6-carboxylic acid (Compound I) is reacted with tent-butyl (methyl-{2-[2-(methylamino)-ethoxy]-ethyl}-sulphamoyl)-carbamate (‘Compound B’) in the presence of a coupling agent in a suitable solvent b) and Compound (II) thus obtained is hydrolysed with an acid to prepare Compound ‘A’. The coupling agent in Step a) is e.g. carbodiimidazole (CDI), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), O-(7-azabenztriazolo-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU), bromotri-(pyrrolidino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBrOP), a combination of 1-hydroxybenztriazole hydrate (HOBt.H2O) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI). A suitable solvent in Step a) is e.g. dichloromethane, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, acetone, 2-butanone, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate or toluene. The hydrolysis in Step b) can be carried out by using trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulphonic acid, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, para-toluenesulphonic acid, sulphuric acid or phosphoric acid. Steps a) and b) can be carried out as a two-step synthesis, in which Compound (II) is isolated in Step a) before carrying out Step b), or else Steps a) and b) are conducted as a one-vessel synthesis. The overall yield obtained in Steps a) and b) is between 86 and 91%, depending on which of the procedures described in Examples 3, 4 and 5 (Experiment B) is used to carry out the new method.

A solution of 4.297 g of tent-butanol (58.0 mmol, 1 Eq) in 33 ml of acetonitrile (0.5 l/mol) was added dropwise over 20 minutes, with the temperature remaining below 4° C. Four minutes later (when the temperature had dropped to 1° C.), a solution of DMAP (116.0 mmol, 2 Eq) in 55 ml of acetonitrile (1 litre/mol) was added dropwise over 24 minutes, with the temperature remaining below 5° C. The solution was allowed to stand for 65 minutes to ensure the best crystallization, with the temperature remaining below 3° C. The white suspension was filtered on a Buchner funnel filter, giving a non-tacky white powder. The precipitate was dried overnight in a drying cabinet at 40° C. under vacuum, which gave 9.465 g of Intermediate (I). EXAMPLE 2 109.1 g (0.825 mol) of 1,5-bis-(methylamino)-3-oxapentane and 1.5 litres of acetonitrile were introduced into a reaction vessel with an inert atmosphere. The resulting solution was cooled to 0° C., and 226 g (0.75 mol) of Intermediate (1) was added to it. The mixture thus obtained was stirred first for 6 hours at 10° C., and then for 3 days at 0° C. The precipitate was filtered off and washed with acetonitrile. After drying at 25° C., Compound ‘B’ was obtained in a yield of 95 g (40.6%, corrected for purity) in the form of white crystals. EXAMPLE 3 0.400 g (0.82 mmol, 1 Eq) of 10-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-13-cyclohexyl-3-methoxy- 7H-indolo-[2,1-a]-[2]-benzazepine-6-carboxylic acid (called Compound 1b on page 38 of WO 2010/003658), 0.164 g of HOBt (1.07 mmol, 1.3 Eq) and 0.201 g of EDCI (1.07 mmol, 1.3 Eq) were dissolved in 6.5 ml of MeTHF (8 l/mol) in a closed glass flask. The contents of the flask were stirred for 1 hour at room temperature. 0.469 g of Compound ‘B’ (64.3 wt-%, 0.98 mmol, 1.2 Eq) was then added to the reaction mixture, which was analysed after a reaction time of 18 hours. Analysis by LC indicated that Intermediate (2) had been obtained in a yield of 93.1%. EXAMPLE 4 12.00 g (24.61 mmol, 1 Eq) of 10-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-13-cyclohexyl-3-methoxy- 7H-indolo-[2,1-a]-[2]-benzazepine-6-carboxylic acid, 4.92 g of HOBt (31.99 mmol, 1.3 Eq) and 6.03 g of EDCI (31.99 mmol, 1.3 Eq) were introduced into a 100-ml flask and dissolved in 200 ml of MeTHF (8 l/mol). The contents of the flask were stirred for 1 hour at room temperature. Then 11.663 g of Compound ‘B’ (77.4 wt-%, 29.53 mmol, 1.2 Eq) was added, and the reaction mixture was analysed after a reaction time of 18 hours. Analysis by LC indicated that Intermediate (2) had been obtained in a yield of 98.3%. The reaction mixture was then extracted and washed first with two 180-ml portions of H2O (15 l/mol), and then with two 180-ml portions of an NaHCO3 solution (15 l/mol). The organic layer was dried with 2.4 g of Na2SO4 and filtered, after which the volume of the filtrate obtained was determined. 60 ml of MeTHF was added to make up the volume to 200 ml (8 l/M). Analysis by LC indicated that Intermediate (2) had been obtained in a yield of 93.7%. EXAMPLE 5 Experiment A To 13.722 g of Intermediate (2) (16.4 wt-%, 1 Eq, 2.88 mmol) dissolved in MeTHF (8 l/mol) in a 100-ml flask without a nitrogen atmosphere(this solution contained 2.17 wt-% of water), 251 pl of water was added to bring the water content up to 4 wt-%. After the addition of 1.9 ml of MeSO3H (1 Eq, 28.8 mmol), the reaction mixture was placed on an oil bath heated to 50° C. A sample was taken and analysed after a reaction time of 5 hours. After a reaction time of 22 hours, the reaction mixture was brought to room temperature, and sampled again for analysis. The whole reaction mixture weighed 15.022 g. Analysis by LC After 5 hours: 90.1% of Compound ‘A’ After 22 hours: 75.4% of Compound ‘A’ Experiment B 119.6 g of Intermediate (2) (10.27 wt-%, 15.7 mmol, 1 Eq) was dissolved in MeTHF (8 l/mol) in a reaction vessel with a nitrogen atmosphere.
