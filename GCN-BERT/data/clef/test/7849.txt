REFERENCE TO SEQUENCE LISTING SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY An official copy of the sequence listing is submitted electronically via EFS-Web as an ASCII formatted sequence listing with a file named “SequenceListing.txt”, created on Jan. 4, 2011, and having a size of 20 kilobytes. The sequence listing contained in this ASCII formatted document is part of the specification and is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The invention relates to a composition comprising an antibody antagonist to c-Met and an aminoheteroaryl compound, particularly as a medicament. The present invention also comprises a pharmaceutical composition comprising said anti c-Met antibody and said aminoheteroaryl compound as combination products for simultaneous, separate or sequential use. The invention relates to the use of the composition of the invention for the treatment of cancer in a mammal. c-Met, is the prototypic member of a sub-family of RTKs which also includes RON and SEA. The c-Met RTK family is structurally different from other RTK families and is the only known high-affinity receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also called scater factor (SF) [D. P. Bottaro et al., Science 1991, 251: 802-804; L. Naldini et al., Eur. Mol. Biol. Org. J. 1991, 10:2867-2878]. c-Met and HGF are widely expressed in a variety of tissue and their expression is normally restricted to cells of epithelial and mesenchymal origin respectively [M. F. Di Renzo et al., Oncogene 1991, 6:1997-2003; E. Sonnenberg et al., J. Cell. Biol. 1993, 123:223-235]. They are both required for normal mammalian development and have been shown to be particularly important in cell migration, morphogenic differentiation, and organization of the three-dimensional tubular structures as well as growth and angiogenesis [F. Baldt et al., Nature 1995, 376:768-771; C. Schmidt et al., Nature. 1995:373:699-702; Tsarfaty et al., Science 1994, 263:98-101]. While the controlled regulation of c-Met and HGF have been shown to be important in mammalian development, tissue maintenance and repair [Nagayama T, Nagayama M, Kohara S, Kamiguchi H, Shibuya M, Katoh Y, Itoh J, Shinohara Y., Brain Res. 2004, 5; 999(2):155-66; Tahara Y, Ido A, Yamamoto S, Miyata Y, Uto H, Hori T, Hayashi K, Tsubouchi H., J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2003, 307(1):146-51], their dysregulation is implicated in the progression of cancers. Aberrant signalling driven by inappropriate activation of c-Met is one of the most frequent alteration observed in human cancers and plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and metastasis [Birchmeier et al., Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003, 4:915-925; L. Trusolino and Comoglio P. M., Nat Rev. Cancer. 2002, 2(4):289-300]. c-Met activation could result from various mechanisms including i) ligand binding, ii) receptor overexpression which leads to spontaneous ligand independent dimerization, or iii) mutations, mainly occurring in the intracellular domain of c-Met, and resulting in increased and persistant phosphorylation of c-Met or in constitutive receptor activation [J. G. Christensen, Burrows J. and Salgia R., Cancer Letters. 2005, 226:1-26]. Activated c-Met recruits signalling effectors to its multidocking site located in the cytoplasm domain, resulting in the activation of several key signalling pathways, including Ras-MAPK, PI3K, Src and Stat3 [Gao C F, Vande Woude G F, Cell Res. 2005, 15(1):49-51; Furge K A, Zhang Y W, Vande Woude G F, Oncogene. 2000, 19(49):5582-9]. These pathways are essential for tumour cell proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis and for evading apoptosis [Furge K A, Zhang Y W, Vande Woude G F, Oncogene, 2000, 19(49):5582-9; Gu H, Neel B G, Trends Cell Biol. 2003 March, 13(3):122-30; Fan S, Ma Y X, Wang J A, Yuan R Q, Meng Q, Cao Y, Laterra J J, Goldberg I D, Rosen E M, Oncogene. 2000 Apr. 27, 19(18):2212-23]. In addition, a unique facet of the c-Met signalling relative to other RTK is its reported interaction with focal adhesion complexes and non kinase binding partners such as α6β4 integrins [Trusolino L, Bertotti A, Comoglio P M, Cell. 2001, 107:643-54], CD44v6 [Van der Voort R, Taher T E, Wielenga V J, Spaargaren M, Prevo R, Smit L, David G, Hartmann G, Gherardi E, Pals S T, J Biol Chem. 1999, 274(10):6499-506], Plexin B1 or semaphorins [Giordano S, Corso S, Conrotto P, Artigiani S, Gilestro G, Barberis D, Tamagnone L, Comoglio P M, Nat Cell Biol. 2002, 4(9):720-4; Conrotto P, Valdembri D, Corso S, Serini G, Tamagnone L, Comoglio P M, Bussolino F, Giordano S, Blood. 2005, 105(11):4321-9; Conrotto P, Corso S, Gamberini S, Comoglio P M, Giordano S, Oncogene. 2004, 23:5131-7] which may further add to the complexity of regulation of cell function by this receptor. Finally recent data demonstrate that c-Met could be involved in tumor resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib suggesting that combination of compound targeting both EGFR and c-Met might be of significant interest [Engelman J A at al., Science, 2007, 316:1039-43]. Greater than 20 mutations have been discovered within the c-met RTK [Ma P. C. et al. Cancer and metastasis rev. 2003, 22:309-25]. The majority of these mutations are missense mutations located in the intracellular part of c-Met, within the tyrosine kinase domain and that can impair affinity or binding properties therapeutic compounds targeting this tyrosine kinase domain. In that way, mutations of c-Met can be more or less responsive to therapeutic inhibitions. For example, in preclinical studies of SU11274 (small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor against c-Met), certain mutations were distinguished to be sensitive and resistant to the action of this agent [Schmidt L. et al. Nat Genet. 1997, 16:68-73; Zhuang Z. et al. Nat Genet. 1998, 20:66-9]. M1268T and H1112Y were sensitive mutations that showed decreased cell growth and motility. Other mutations such as L1213V and Y1248 were found to be resistant to and unaffected by SU11274 [Hahn O. et al. Hematol Oncol Clin N Am. 2005, 19:343-67]. These studies demonstrate the direct impact of specific mutations on treatments targeting c-Met. However, an oligomerization of c-Met, in presence or in absence of the ligand, is required to regulate the binding affinity and the binding kinetics of the kinase toward ATP and tyrosine-containing peptide substrates [Hays J. I., Watowich S J, Biochemistry. 2004, 43:10570-8]. In the past few years, many different strategies have been developed to attenuate c-Met signalling in cancer cell lines. These strategies include i) neutralizing antibodies against c-Met or HGF/S F [Cao B, Su Y, Oskarsson M, Zhao P, Kort E J, Fisher R J, Wang L M, Vande Woude G F, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2001, 98(13):7443-8; Martens T, Schmidt N O, Eckerich C, Fillbrandt R, Merchant M, Schwall R, Westphal M, Lamszus K, Clin Cancer Res. 2006, 12(20):6144-52] or the use of HGF/SF antagonist NK4 to prevent ligand binding to c-Met [Kuba K, Matsumoto K, Date K, Shimura H, Tanaka M, Nakamura T, Cancer Res., 2000, 60:6737-43], ii) small ATP binding site inhibitors to c-Met that block kinase activity [Christensen J G, Schreck R, Burrows J, Kuruganti P, Chan E, Le P, Chen J, Wang X, Ruslim L, Blake R, Lipson K E, Ramphal J, Do S, Cui J J, Cherrington J M, Mendel D B, Cancer Res. 2003, 63:7345-55], iii) engineered SH2 domain polypeptide that interferes with access to the multidocking site and RNAi or ribozyme that reduce receptor or ligand expression. Most of these approaches display a selective inhibition of c-Met resulting in tumor inhibition and showing that c-Met could be of interest for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Within the molecules generated for c-Met targeting, some are antibodies. One of the most extensively described is the anti-c-Met 5D5 antibody generated by Genentech [WO96/38557] which behaves as a potent agonist when added alone in various models and as an antagonist when used as a Fab fragment. Another antibody targeting c-Met is described by Pfizer as an antibody acting “predominantly as c-Met antagonist, and in some instance as a c-Met agonist” [WO 2005/016382]. The inventor has demonstrated that the antibodies antagonists to c-Met, called 224G11, 227H1, 223C4 and 11E1, or functional fragment thereof, described herein and which have been also described in the patent applications EP 07301231.2 filed on Jul. 12, 2007 and U.S. 61/020,639 filed on Jan. 11, 2008, have the property to inhibit the c-Met dimerization and are active in vivo. It can then be considered the problem to be solved by the invention as being the provision of a concrete, and not only a putative, combination beneficial for the treatment of cancer. More particularly, it is an object of the invention to provide a novel and unexpected combination able to affect all the factors involved in the c-Met activation as previously described. In a general aspect, the invention relates to a method of treatment of cancer in a mammal which comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of active components comprising an antagonist to c-Met and an aminoheteroaryl compound. In another general aspect, the present invention is directed to a composition comprising an antibody antagonist to c-Met, or a functional fragment thereof, and an aminoheteroaryl compound, preferably for its use as a medicament. The present invention is further directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least: i) one antibody antagonist to c-Met, or a functional fragment thereof; and ii) an aminoheteroaryl compound, as combination products for simultaneous, separate or sequential use. “Simultaneous use” is understood as meaning the administration of the two compounds of the composition according to the invention in a single and identical pharmaceutical form. “Separate use” is understood as meaning the administration, at the same time, of the two compounds of the composition according to the invention in distinct pharmaceutical forms. “Sequential use” is understood as meaning the successive administration of the two compounds of the composition according to the invention, each in a distinct pharmaceutical form. According to the invention, the combination is preferably mixed with an excipient and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. It is also described and claimed a composition according to the invention as a medicament. In another embodiment, the combination of the invention may be in the form of a kit of parts. The invention therefore includes a product containing an antibody antagonist to c-Met, or one of these functional fragments, and an aminoheteroaryl compound, preferably capable of inhibiting the c-Met protein kinase activity as defined above, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential delivery for he treatment of cancer in a mammal in need thereof. In one embodiment, a product contains an antibody antagonist to c-Met, or a functional fragment thereof, and an aminoheteroaryl compound as defined above as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in treating a cancer in a mammal in need thereof. In one embodiment, the invention provides a pharmaceutical pack containing a course of an anti-cancer treatment for one individual mammal, wherein the pack contains (a) at least one unit of an antibody antagonist to c-Met and (b) at least one unit of an aminoheteroaryl compound in unit dosage form. In a more specific aspect, the invention deals with a method of treatment of cancer in a mammal which comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of the combination of active components according to the present invention comprising an antibody antagonist to c-Met, or functional fragment thereof, and an aminoheteroaryl compound. In an also more specific aspect, the invention deals with a composition comprising an antibody antagonist to c-Met, or functional fragment thereof, and an aminoheteroaryl according to the present invention for the treatment of cancer, preferably in a mammal, more preferably in human. Said anti-cancer treatment comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of the composition of the present invention. Preferably, said composition further comprises a pharmaceutical acceptable carrier and/or excipient. In a preferred embodiment, said aminoheteroaryl compound is capable of inhibiting the c-Met protein kinase, More preferred are aminoheteroaryl compounds having at least 25%, preferably 40%, 50%, 60%, 75% and 85% of the c-Met protein kinase inhibiting activity demonstrated for the aminoheteroaryl compound named PF-02341066 in the same assay procedure conditions (see herein the complete structure of this PF-02341066 compound). Among the assay procedures which can be used to determine the level of activity of the c-Met protein kinase in presence of said aminoheroaryl compound, we can cite the procedure assay named “HGFR continuous-coupled spectrophotometric assay” described from page 100 in the PCT patent application published under the number WO 2006/021884. The terms “antibody”, “antibodies” or “immunoglobulin” are used interchangeably in the broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies (e.g., full length or intact monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multivalent antibodies or multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity). More particularly, such molecule consists in a glycoprotein comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (or domain) (abbreviated herein as HCVR or VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as LCVR or VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g. effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system. They may also include certain antibody functional fragments, as described in greater detail herein, thereof which exhibit the desired binding specificity and affinity, regardless of the source or immunoglobulin type (i.e., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgA, etc.). In general, for the preparation of monoclonal antibodies or their functional fragments, especially of murine origin, it is possible to refer to techniques which are described in particular in the manual “Antibodies” (Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor N.Y., pp. 726, 1988) or to the technique of preparation from hybridomas described by Kohler and Milstein (Nature, 256:495-497, 1975). By the expression “antagonist”, it must be understood a compound which is capable of, directly or indirectly, counteracting, reducing or inhibiting the biological activity of c-Met. In general, a “therapeutically effective amount” refers to the minimum concentrations or amounts of a compound or of compounds which are effective to prevent, alleviate, reduce or ameliorate symptoms of disease or prolong the survival of the patient being treated. More particularly, in reference to the treatment of cancer, a therapeutically effective amount refers to that amount which has the effect of (1) reducing the size of (or preferably eliminating) the tumor; (2) inhibiting (that is, slowing to some extent, preferably stopping) tumor metastasis; (3) inhibiting to some extent (that is slowing to some extent, preferably stopping) tumor growth; and/or, (4) relieving to some extent (or preferably eliminating) one or more symptoms associated with the cancer. More particularly, said antibody antagonist to c-Met, or functional fragment thereof, is selected from the group consisting of: an antibody (derived from the 224G11 antibody), or a functional fragment thereof, comprising a heavy chain containing CDR-H1, CDR-H2 and CDR-H3 comprising respectively the amino acid sequences SEQ ID Nos. 1, 2 and 3; and a light chain containing CDR-L1, CDR-L2 and CDR-L3 comprising respectively the amino acid sequences SEQ ID Nos. 10, 11 and 12; an antibody (derived from the 227H1 antibody), or a functional fragment thereof, comprising a heavy chain containing CDR-H1, CDR-H2 and CDR-H3 comprising respectively the amino acid sequences SEQ ID Nos. 4, 5 and 6; and a light chain containing CDR-L1, CDR-L2 and CDR-L3 comprising respectively the amino acid sequences SEQ ID Nos. 13, 11 and 14; an antibody (derived from the 223C4 antibody), comprising a heavy chain containing CDR-H1, CDR-H2 and CDR-H3 comprising respectively the amino acid sequences SEQ ID Nos. 7, 8 and 9; and a light chain containing CDR-L1, CDR-L2 and CDR-L3 comprising respectively the amino acid sequences SEQ ID Nos. 15, 16 and 17; and an antibody (derived from the 11E1 antibody), comprising a heavy chain containing CDR-H1, CDR-H2 and CDR-H3 comprising respectively the amino acid sequences SEQ ID Nos. 47, 48 and 49; and a light chain containing CDR-L1, CDR-L2 and CDR-L3 comprising respectively the amino acid sequences SEQ ID Nos. 50, 51 and 52. In a more preferred embodiment, said antibody antagonist to c-Met, or functional fragment thereof, is selected from the group consisting of: an antibody (derived from the 224G11 antibody), or a functional fragment thereof, comprising a heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID No. 18 and a light chain comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID No. 21; an antibody (derived from the 227H1 antibody), or a functional fragment thereof, comprising a heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID No. 19 and a light chain comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID No. 22; an antibody (derived from the 223C4 antibody), a heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID No. 20 and a light chain comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID No. 23; and an antibody (derived from the 11E1 antibody), comprising a heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID No. 53 and a light chain comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID No. 54. In another particular aspect, said antibody antagonist to c-Met, or functional fragment thereof, are recombinant, chimeric or humanized antibody, or fagment thereof, derived from said 224G11, 227H1, 223C4 or 11E1s antibody (derived is intended to designate the antibodies, or fragment thereof, comprising at least the 6 CDRs, or at least the light and heavy chain as defined above for each of these antibodies). More particularly, in a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a method or a composition according to the invention, wherein said antibody antagonist to c-Met is selected from 224G11, 227H1, 223C4 and 11E1. All these monoclonal antibodies were secreted by hybridomas deposited at the Collection Nationale the Cultures de Microorganisms (Institut Pasteur, Rue du Docteur Roux, Paris, France), CNCM on Mar. 14, 2007 under the numbers CNCM I-3724 (corresponding to 11E1), I-3731 (corresponding to 224G11), I-3732 (corresponding to 227H1) and on Jul. 6, 2007 under the number I-3786 (corresponding to 223C4). These hybridomas consist in murine hybridoma resulting in the cellular fusion of immunized mouse splenocytes with a myeloma cell line (Sp20 Ag14). By CDR regions or CDR(s), it is intended to indicate the hypervariable regions of the heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulins as defined by IMGT. The IMGT unique numbering has been defined to compare the variable domains whatever the antigen receptor, the chain type, or the species [Lefranc M.-P., Immunology Today 18, 509 (1997); Lefranc M.-P., The Immunologist, 7, 132-136 (1999); Lefranc, M.-P., Pommié, C., Ruiz, M., Giudicelli, V., Foulquier, E., Truong, L., Thouvenin-Contet, V. and Lefranc, Dev. Comp. Immunol., 27, 55-77 (2003)]. In the IMGT unique numbering, the conserved amino acids always have the same position, for instance cysteine 23 (1 st-CYS), tryptophan 41 (CONSERVED-TRP), hydrophobic amino acid 89, cysteine 104 (2nd-CYS), phenylalanine or tryptophan 118 (J-PHE or J-TRP). The IMGT unique numbering provides a standardized delimitation of the framework regions (FR1-IMGT: positions 1 to 26, FR2-IMGT: 39 to 55, FR3-IMGT: 66 to 104 and FR4-IMGT: 118 to 128) and of the complementarity determining regions: CDR1-IMGT: 27 to 38, CDR2-IMGT: 56 to 65 and CDR3-IMGT: 105 to 117. As gaps represent unoccupied positions, the CDR-IMGT lengths (shown between brackets and separated by dots, e.g. [8.8.13]) become crucial information. The IMGT unique numbering is used in 2D graphical representations, designated as IMGT Colliers de Perles [Ruiz, M. and Lefranc, M.-P., Immunogenetics, 53, 857-883 (2002); Kaas, Q. and Lefranc, M.-P., Current Bioinformatics, 2, 21-30 (2007)], and in 3D structures in IMGT/3D structure-DB [Kaas, Q., Ruiz, M. and Lefranc, M.-P., T cell receptor and MHC structural data. Nucl. Acids. Res., 32, D208-D210 (2004)]. Three heavy chain CDRs and 3 light chain CDRs exist. The term CDR or CDRs is used here in order to indicate, according to the case, one of these regions or several, or even the whole, of these regions which contain the majority of the amino acid residues responsible for the binding by affinity of the antibody for the antigen or the epitope which it recognizes. The following table 1 regroups elements concerning the preferred antibodies. TABLE 1 224G11 227H1 223C4 11E1 I-3731 I-3732 I-3786 I-3724 Prot. Nucl. Prot; Nucl. Prot. Nucl. Prot. Nucl.

More particularly, said cancer is selected from prostate cancer, osteosarcomas, lung cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, glyoblastoma or colon cancer. The invention will be better understood at the reading of the following examples wherein: FIG. 1 illustrates the in vivo activity of 224G11 and the in vivo activity of PF-2341066 on NCI-H441 NSCLC, and FIG. 2 illustrates the synergic in vivo activity of a combination of 224G11 and PF-2341066 on NCI-H441 NSCLC. EXAMPLE 1 In Vivo Activity of 224G11 and PF-02341066 as Single Treatments In order to verify that the NCI-H441 in vivo model available in the laboratory is sensible to both the 224G11 antibody and the PF-2341066 compound, immunocompromised mice engrafted subcutaneously with NCI-H441 were used. Briefly, NCI-H441 NSCLC cells from ATCC were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% FCS, 1% L-Glutamine. Cells were split two days before engraftment so that they were in exponential phase of growth. Ten million NCI-H441 cells were injected s.c. to Athymic nude mice. Five days after implantation, tumors were measurable and animals were divided into groups of 6 mice with comparable tumor size. For the antibody treatment, mice were treated i.p. with a loading dose of 2 mg of 224G11 Mab/mouse and then twice a week with 1 mg of antibody/mouse. 50 mg/kg of PF-02341066 was administered p.o. (oral gavage), daily for a week and then 5 days a week with a double dose the fifth day. Treatment lasted during the whole experiment. Tumor volume was measured twice a week and calculated by the formula: π/6×length×width×height. Results described in FIG. 1 showed a significant difference in tumors growth of mice treated both with 224G11 and PF-02341066. In this experiment 224G11 and PF2341066 showed comparable antitumoral activities. Example 2 In Vivo Activity of a Combination of 224G11 and PF-02341066 NCI-H441 cells from ATCC were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% FCS, 1% L-Glutamine. Cells were split two days before engraftment so that they were in exponential phase of growth. Ten million NCI-H441 cells were engrafted to Athymic nude mice. Five days after implantation, tumors were measurable and animals were divided into groups of 6 mice with comparable tumor size. For the antibody treatment, mice were treated i.p. with a loading dose of 2 mg of 224G11 Mab/mouse and then twice a week with 1 mg of antibody/mouse. 50 mg/kg of PF-2341066 was administered p.o. (oral gavage), daily for a week and then 5 days a week with a double dose the fifth day. The group of mice receiving both 224G11 and PF-2341066 was treated following the same modalities as the one described above for each compound. Tumor volume was measured twice a week and calculated by the formula: m/6×length×width×height and animal weights were monitored every day over the period of treatment. Statistical analysis was performed at each measured time using a Mann-Whitney test. In this experiment, mice of the control group were sacrificed on day 53 for ethical reasons. At day 53 post first injection, the average tumor volume of single modality treated groups is reduced by 64%, 73% and 93% for 224G11, PF-2341066 and 224G11+PF-2341066 respectively. At Day 53, the combined therapy improved significantly tumor growth compared to single therapy treatments (p≦0.002 compared to PF-2341066 alone and p≦≦0.002 compared to 224G11 alone), 1 out of 6 mice being without tumor in the combined therapy group. No significant differences were observed between the 2 single modality treatment. These results, represented at FIG. 2, were confirmed 14 days after the end of treatments (D67) where tumor volume of the group receiving the combination therapy remained significantly lower than the ones injected with the single modality treatment and where 16% of mice receiving the combined treatment were still tumor free. 1.-14.
