Field of the Invention The present invention pertains to liquid extraction cleaning devices of the type that spray cleaning liquid onto surfaces and thereafter suck the liquid back up to clean such surfaces. More specifically, the present invention pertains to liquid extraction cleaning devices that are used to clean carpet or upholstery and that store the cleaning solution and recovered liquid onboard. 2. General Background Some carpet and upholstery extraction cleaners are known in the industry as floor cleaners and some are known as spot cleaners. A typical floor cleaner comprises a wheeled main unit that rests on the floor and comprises one or more liquid spray nozzles, one or more agitators, and one or more vacuum intake nozzles beneath the main unit. As the main unit of such a floor cleaner is dragged over carpet, liquid spray is discharged from the main unit. The agitator of the main unit is then used to work the liquid into the carpet. Following the agitation, the vacuum intake nozzles of the main unit extract as much of the soiled liquid from the carpet as possible. It is common for floor cleaners to be configured to perform all of these actions simultaneously, albeit on different portions of the carpet. Thus, as the main unit is dragged or self-propelled over carpet, the spraying, agitating, and vacuuming occurs sequentially on any given portion of the carpet. Spot cleaners tend to be smaller than floor cleaners and are typically used to pick up spills, remove localized stains, or clean furniture upholstery. Some spot cleaners are merely handheld devices that comprise the same general features of the larger floor cleaners, but without the wheels. Other spot cleaners comprise a hand tool that is attached to a main unit via a flexible hose. With such hand tool spot cleaners, the hand tool performs the spraying and the vacuuming and may or may not perform agitation. The vacuum motor and most other necessary components of such hand tool spot cleaners are contained in the main unit. Many floor cleaners are provided with an accessory hand tool and hose that allow the floor cleaners to also serve as spot cleaners. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed primarily to floor cleaner liquid extraction devices. In one aspect of the invention, a liquid extraction cleaning device comprises a vacuum pump, a liquid pump, a cleaning solution tank, a recovery tank, a spray nozzle, a vacuum inlet port, and an agitator assembly. The cleaning solution tank is configured and adapted to store a cleaning liquid and is operatively connected to the liquid pump in a manner such that the liquid pump can draw cleaning liquid from the cleaning solution tank. The recovery tank is configured and adapted to store soiled cleaning liquid extracted from a floor and is operatively connected to the vacuum pump in a manner such that the vacuum pump can draw air from the recovery tank. The spray nozzle is operatively connected to the liquid pump in a manner such that the liquid pump is capable of forcing cleaning liquid out of the spray nozzle. The vacuum inlet port is operatively connected to the recovery tank and the vacuum pump in a manner such that the vacuum pump is capable of drawing fluid through the vacuum inlet port and into the recovery tank. The agitator assembly comprises first and second agitators and an electric motor. The first agitator is operatively connected to the electric motor in a manner such that operation of the electric motor causes the first agitator to rotate. The second agitator is operatively connected to the electric motor in a manner such that operation of the electric motor causes the second agitator to reciprocate. In another aspect of the invention, a liquid extraction cleaning device comprises a vacuum pump, a liquid pump, a cleaning solution tank, a recovery tank, a vacuum inlet port, an agitator assembly, first and second spray nozzles, and a liquid spray selection switch.

The recovery tank is configured and adapted to store soiled cleaning liquid extracted from a floor and is operatively connected to the vacuum pump in a manner such that the vacuum pump can draw air from the recovery tank. The vacuum inlet port is operatively connected to the recovery tank and the vacuum pump in a manner such that the vacuum pump is capable of drawing fluid through the vacuum inlet port and into the recovery tank. The agitator assembly comprises an agitator that is configured and adapted to move relative to the inlet port. Each of the first and second spray nozzles is operatively connected to the liquid pump in a manner such that the liquid pump is capable of forcing cleaning liquid from the cleaning solution tank out of the spray nozzle. The liquid spray selection switch is adapted and configured to selectively prevent cleaning liquid pumped by the liquid pump from being forced out of the second spray nozzle while permitting cleaning liquid pumped by the liquid pump to be forced out of the first spray nozzle, the liquid spray selection switch is also adapted and configured to selectively permit cleaning liquid pumped by the liquid pump to be forced out of the first and second spray nozzles simultaneously. In yet another aspect of the invention, a liquid extraction cleaning device comprises a main unit, a cleaning solution tank, a recovery tank, a vacuum inlet port, and an adjustable handle.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION A preferred embodiment of a liquid extraction cleaning device in accordance with the invention is shown in FIGS. 1-4. The extraction cleaner 10 comprises a main unit 12, a cleaning solution tank assembly 14, a recovery tank assembly 16, a handle 18, and accessories 20. The main unit 12 comprises a vacuum pump 22, a liquid pump 24, an agitator assembly 26, a primary spray nozzle 28, and preferably a secondary spray nozzle 30, an accessory tool liquid port 32, a spray selection switch 34, and a vacuum inlet port 36, and a lifting handle 37. The vacuum pump 22 is operatively connected to the recovery tank assembly 16 in a manner such that the vacuum pump can draw air from the recovery tank. The recovery tank assembly 16 is operatively connected to the vacuum inlet port 36 in a manner such that the vacuum inlet port draws in air and/or liquid when air is drawn from the recovery tank assembly by the vacuum pump 22. The liquid pump 24 is operatively connected to the solution tank assembly 14 for drawing liquid therefrom, and is operatively connected to the primary spray nozzle 28, the secondary spray nozzle 30, and the accessory tool liquid port 32 to supply pressurized liquid thereto. The spray selection switch 34 is operatively connected to the liquid pump 24 and preferably is a hand operated mechanical fluid valve that has three settings for channeling the liquid from the liquid pump. In one setting, the spray selection switch 34 allows liquid to travel from the liquid pump 24 to the primary spray nozzle 28, while preventing liquid from traveling from the liquid pump to the secondary spray nozzle 30 and/or accessory tool liquid port 32. In another setting, the spray selection switch 34 allows liquid to travel from the liquid pump 24 to the primary spray nozzle 28 and the secondary spray nozzle 30, while preventing liquid from traveling from the liquid pump to the accessory tool liquid port 32. In the third setting, the spray selection switch 34 allows liquid to travel from the liquid pump 24 to the accessory tool liquid port 32, while preventing liquid from traveling from the liquid pump to the primary spray nozzle 28 and/or the secondary spray nozzle 30. It should be appreciated however that this functionality could alternatively be carried out via electrical valves or a combination of electrical and mechanical valves. The agitator assembly 26 of the main unit 12 comprises a housing 38, a rotational agitator 40, a reciprocating agitator 42, an electric motor 44, and a pair of fixed side brushes 46. The rotational agitator 40 comprises a plurality of bristles 48 (some of which are omitted in the drawing figures) that extend from bristle holes 50 formed in a roller 52. The reciprocating agitator 42 is preferably configured to pivotally reciprocate and comprises brush bar 54 (also comprising bristles 48) that pivotally reciprocates about an axis that is parallel to the rotational axis of the rotational agitator 40. The axis about which the reciprocating agitator 42 pivots is preferably fixed relative to the housing 38. In contrast, the axis about which the rotational agitator 40 revolves preferably is able to pivot up or down (parallel to the ground) about an axis defined by the motor housing 56 that surrounds the electric motor 44. As shown most clearly in FIGS. 8 and 9, the motor housing 56 comprises an axle portion 58 that is free to pivot within a channel formed partially by the housing 38 and partially by the adjacent portion of the bottom of the main unit 12 of the liquid extraction cleaning device 10. Rigid arms 60 fixed to the motor housing 56 extend from the motor housing and connect to the opposite ends of the rotational agitator 40. Thus, motor housing 56 and the rotational agitator 40 pivot together about the axis of the axle portion 58 of the motor housing relative to the housing 38 of the agitator assembly 26. As such, only the force of gravity acting on the motor housing 56 and the rotational agitator 40 forces the rotational agitator downward against a floor (the weight of the electric motor 44 does not influence that force since the center of mass of the motor is aligned with the axle portion 58 of the motor housing). The electric motor 44 preferably drives the rotation of the rotational agitator 40 via a drive belt (not shown) located in one of the arms 60. A linking member 62 preferably connects an off-axis portion 64 adjacent to an end of the rotational agitator 40 to a pivot arm 66 of the reciprocating agitator 42. The linking member 62 thereby transforms rotational movement of the rotational agitator 40 into pivotal reciprocation of the reciprocating agitator 42. The fixed side brushes 46 of the agitator assembly 26 are mounted to the bottom of the housing 38 on opposite sides of the rotational agitator 40. Thus, the fixed side brushes 46 move only with the main unit 12 of the liquid extractor 10. The front of the housing 38 of the agitator assembly 26 also forms a part of the vacuum inlet port 36, with the other portion being formed by a piece of translucent material 68 in a manner such that liquid drawn into the vacuum inlet port can easily be observed. The housing 38 also supports the primary spray nozzle 28. As shown below in FIG. 3, the vacuum inlet port 36 is preferably located adjacent the front on the bottom of the main unit 12 and the rotational agitator 40 lies behind the vacuum inlet port 36 and between the vacuum inlet port and the reciprocating agitator 42. The primary spray nozzle 28 is preferably located immediately aft of the reciprocating agitator 42 and is configured to spray liquid downward in a fan-like pattern. In contrast, the secondary spray nozzle 30 is positioned on the rear of the liquid extraction cleaning device 10 and is preferably at least three times as far behind the vacuum inlet port as compared to the primary spray nozzle 28. It should be appreciate that, in operation, liquid extraction cleaning device 10 is preferably pulled rather than pushed. Thus, carpet is first wetted by the primary spray nozzle 28 or by the primary and secondary spray nozzles 28, 30 prior to being agitated, and liquid extraction via the vacuum inlet port 36 occurs after agitation. By positioning the secondary spray nozzle 30 much further behind the vacuum inlet 36 port as compared to the primary spray nozzle 28, the liquid sprayed from the secondary spray nozzle has a much longer dwell time on/in the carpet than does the liquid sprayed from the primary spray nozzle. Thus, operation of the secondary spray nozzle 30 not only increases the amount of liquid per area sprayed during a given pass of the liquid extraction cleaning device 10, but also increases the penetration time in which the liquid can penetrate the carpet. It should therefore be appreciated that the secondary spray nozzle 30 is typically only used during an initial cleaning pass or when deep liquid penetration is desired. The lifting handle 37 Is preferably positioned above the center of gravity of the liquid extraction cleaning device 10 and is configured to support the weight of the entire liquid extraction cleaning device. A pair of wheels 70 are preferably attached to the main unit 12 on opposite sides thereof and adjacent the rear of the liquid extraction cleaning device 10. The wheels 70 not only make it easier to pull the liquid extraction cleaning device 10 over carpet during operation, but also allow users to tilt the main unit 12 about the wheels and thereby push the liquid extraction cleaning device. The handle 18 of the liquid extraction cleaning device 10 is preferably pivotally connected to the upper rear edge of the main unit 12. The handle preferably comprises a locking mechanism 72, an electrical input port 74, a main power switch 76, a liquid pump switch 78, and power cord wrap posts 80. As shown in FIG. 11, the locking mechanism preferably comprises an internal linking member 82 connecting an external release member 84 to internal locking pins 86. The locking pins 86 cooperate with notched members 88 that are fixed relative to the main unit 12 of the liquid extraction cleaning device 10 in a manner such that the locking mechanism 72 can fix the pivotal orientation of the handle 18 relative to the main unit in any of a plurality of angles. The linking member 82 is preferably biased toward the notched members 88 via a spring 90 such that the locking mechanism 72 only allows the handle 18 to pivot relative to the main unit 12 when the release member 84 is pulled away from the base of the handle. Preferably, the handle 18 can be pivoted forward relative to the main unit 12 to such a degree that the handle is horizontal or even tilts downward a bit. As shown in FIG. 4, with the handle 18 tilted forward, the entire liquid extraction cleaning device 10 can be tilted on its back such that minimal floor space is required to stow the liquid extraction cleaning device. The electrical input port 74 on the handle 18 merely is a port for receiving the power supply cord (not shown) of the liquid extraction cleaning device 10 and the power cord wrap posts 80 are merely conventional posts for wrapping and storing the power cord when the extraction cleaning device is not in use. The main power switch 76 of the handle 18 is preferably an electrical three-way toggle switch that is capable of shutting off all power to the liquid extraction cleaning device 10. Alternatively, the main power switch 76 can be toggled to activate the vacuum pump 22 or the vacuum pump and, simultaneously, the electric motor 44 of agitator assembly 26. In either of such later alternatives, the liquid pump 24 can also be activated by depressing the liquid pump switch 78 of the handle 18. The cleaning solution tank assembly 14 comprises a tank portion 92, a fill cap 94, and a handle 96. Like with typical liquid extraction cleaning devices, the tank portion 92 is operatively connected to the liquid pump 24 when the tank portion is in position on the main unit 12. To refill the cleaning solution tank assembly 14 with cleaning solution (which should be understood to include water by itself too), a person can lift up on the handle 96. The handle 96 is preferably pivotally connected to the tank portion 92 such that the handle pivots upward when relative to the tank portion when lifted. This makes it easier to hold and lift the entire cleaning solution tank assembly 14 from the main unit 12. The fill cap 94 is preferably threadably attached to the tank portion 92 and is threadably removed to refill the tank. The fill cap 94 also preferably serves as a measuring cup for diluting concentrated cleaning solution. The recovery tank assembly 16 comprises a tank portion 98, a drain cap 100, a handle 102, and an intake duct 104. Like typical recovery tanks, the tank portion 98 is configured to collect liquid extracted through the vacuum inlet port 36 of the main unit 12 as air is drawn out of the tank portion 98 via the vacuum pump 22. The front wall of the tank portion 98 comprises the opening 106 through which an air and liquid mixture enters the tank. The drain cap 100 is preferably threadably attached to a drain port of the tank portion 98 and can be threadably removed therefrom to drain the tank. The intake duct 104 surrounds an intake passageway. The intake duct 104 comprises a lower catch 108 and an upper discharge tube 110. The discharge tube 110 surrounds a portion of the intake passageway and comprises a releasable locking tab 112 that cooperates with the lower catch 108 to releasably attach the intake duct 104 to the tank portion 98 of the recovery tank assembly 16. More specifically, the intake duct 104 is attached to the tank portion 98 by first hooking the lower catch 108 over a lip at the bottom of the front wall of the tank portion 98, and thereafter pivoting the intake duct upward about the lower catch such that the discharge tube 110 extends through the opening 106 of the tank portion 98 and the locking tab 112 clicks. Once the locking tab 112 clicks, the locking tab prevents the intake duct 104 from separating from the tank portion 98 unless the locking tab is manually deflected by reaching into the tank from the drain port of the tank portion 98. The front wall of the intake duct 104 preferably comprises an accessory tool vacuum inlet port 114 that is selectively covered by a pliable flap 116. When the flap 116 is bent down, the accessory tool vacuum inlet port 114 is configured to receive the downstream end of an accessory tool hose as described below. When the flap 116 is up and is covering the accessory tool vacuum inlet port 114, the intake duct 104 operatively connects the vacuum inlet port 36 to the interior of the tank portion 98 of the recovery tank assembly 16. Like with the cleaning solution tank assembly 14, the handle 102 of the recovery tank assembly 16 is pivotally connected to the tank portion 98 of the recovery tank assembly to make it easier to hold and lift the entire recovery tank assembly 16 off of the main unit 12. As shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, one of the accessories 20 is a hand tool 118 that is attached to a flexible hose 120. The hand tool 118 comprises a vacuum inlet port 122, an agitator 124, and spray nozzle 126, and a grip portion 128. The vacuum inlet port 122 and the grip portion 128 are configured such that air and liquid can be drawn in through the inlet port, pass through the grip portion, and then into the hose 120. The agitator 124 is preferably a brush bar comprising bristles and is adjacent to the vacuum inlet port 122 and is preferably fixed relative to the grip portion. The spray nozzle 126 is adjacent to the agitator 124 opposite the vacuum inlet port 122 and is operatively connectable to the 24 liquid pump of the main unit 12 via flexible liquid tube 130. The grip portion 128 preferably comprises a spray trigger 132 the operates a liquid valve (not shown) in a manner such that the liquid pump 24 can only force liquid out of the spray nozzle 126 when the spray trigger is depressed. The downstream end of the hose 120 comprises a fitting 134. The liquid tube 130 passes through the fitting wall upstream of the fitting outlet 136. The outlet 136 of the fitting 134 preferably comprises a bayonet style connector 138 and is configured to be inserted through the accessory tool vacuum inlet port 114 of the intake duct 104 of the recovery tank assembly 16. When inserted, the connector 138 of the fitting 134 can be releasably attached to the discharge tube 110 of the intake duct 104 in a manner such that the hose 120 is operatively connected to the vacuum pump 22 of the main unit 12 and such that air cannot be drawn in from the remainder of the intake duct 104 from the vacuum inlet port 36 of the main unit 12 into the tank portion 98 of the recovery tank assembly 16. The end of the liquid tube 130 comprises a fitting 139 that is connectable to the accessory tool liquid port 32 of the main unit 12 for operatively connecting the spray nozzle 126 of the hand tool 118 to the liquid pump 24 of the main unit. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, another one of the accessories 20 of the liquid extraction cleaning device is a tool caddy 140 that is removably connectable to the rear side of the handle 18. The tool caddy is configured to releasably hold the hand tool 118 and the hose 120 when the hand tool 118 is not in use. In view of the foregoing, it should be appreciated that the invention has several advantages over the prior art.
