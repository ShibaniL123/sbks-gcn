Such a flat plate display includes a liquid crystal display (LCD), a field emission display, a plasma display panel (PDP), an electro-luminescence (EL) display and an organic light-emitting display (OLED). Flat plate displays are being developed that are thin and portable. Among the flat plate displays, organic light-emitting apparatuses are self-emitting type display apparatuses that have attracted much attention as next-generation display apparatuses because of wide viewing angles, good contrast, and fast response speeds. An organic light-emitting display includes an intermediate layer, a first electrode, and a second electrode. The intermediate layer includes an organic emission layer which emits visible light if a voltage is applied to the first and second electrodes. In this instance, the organic light-emitting display may be contaminated and damaged due to an encapsulation member disposed over the second electrode or due to impurities. In order to prevent this, various encapsulation members, for example, an encapsulation layer, such as an organic encapsulation layer or an inorganic encapsulation layer, may be formed. However, since it is difficult to perform a process of forming the encapsulation layer, there is a limitation in improving characteristics of the encapsulation layer, and thus, there is a limitation in improving encapsulation characteristics of the organic light-emitting display.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Now, an exemplary embodiment according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. FIG. 1 is a schematic view of a deposition source and a deposition apparatus including the deposition source according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1, a deposition apparatus 100 includes a chamber 110, a deposition source 120, a stage 105, and a driving unit 130. Although not shown in FIG. 1, the chamber 110 includes at least one inlet/outlet through which a substrate 101 may pass. Also, the chamber 110 may be connected to a pump (not shown) for controlling pressure so as to maintain proper pressure in the chamber 110. Alternatively, the chamber 110 may be maintained at air pressure. The stage 105 is disposed inside the chamber 110. The substrate 101 is mounted on one surface of the stage 105. A fixing device (not shown) may be used to fix the substrate 101 mounted on the stage 105. The fixing device may be any of various types of devices, for example, a clamp, a pressing device, an adhesive material, or the like. The deposition source 120 faces the substrate 101. The deposition source 120 includes a crucible 121, a nozzle 122, and hardening portions 123 and 124. The crucible 121 accommodates a deposition material (not shown). A heating device, such as a heater (not shown), for heating the deposition material may be disposed around the crucible 121. The nozzle 122 is connected to the crucible 121 so that the deposition material evaporates, is discharged via the nozzle 122, and then moves toward the substrate 101, thereby forming a deposited film on the substrate 101. The hardening portions 123 and 124 are disposed at opposite sides of the nozzle 122 and crucible 121. The hardening portion 123 includes an ultraviolet (UV) irradiation unit 123a and a body 123b. The body 123b generates UV light, and the UV irradiation unit 123a irradiates the generated UV light toward the substrate 101. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the UV irradiation unit 123a and the body 123b may be formed as one body. The hardening portion 124 includes an UV irradiation unit 124a and a body 124b. The body 124b generates UV light, and the UV irradiation unit 124a irradiates the generated UV light toward the substrate 101. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the UV irradiation unit 124a and the body 124b may be formed as one body. Although a hardening process using UV light has been described in the current embodiment, the present invention is not limited thereto. In other words, the hardening portion 123 and the hardening portion 124 may generate and irradiate visible light. For this, the hardening portion 123 and the hardening portion 124 may include a body (not shown) and an irradiating unit (not shown) for irradiating visible light. The hardening portion 123 and the hardening portion 124 are disposed adjacent to the nozzle 122 to simultaneously harden the deposition material as soon as the deposition material discharged via the nozzle 122 reaches the substrate 101. The driving unit 130 is connected to the stage 105. The driving unit 130 may move the stage 105 in a first direction (in a direction of an arrow M1) or in a second direction (in a direction of an arrow M2) that is opposite to the first direction, as shown in FIG. 1. Hereinafter, operations and effects of the deposition apparatus 100 of the current embodiment will be simply described. The deposition material is seated on the substrate 101 via the nozzle 122 to form the deposited film on the substrate 101. In particular, when an organic material monomer having liquidity is accommodated as the deposition material in the crucible 121, the organic material monomer is discharged via the nozzle 122 and reaches the substrate 101. As soon as the deposition material reaches the substrate 101, the deposition material, that is, the organic material monomer, is immediately hardened through the hardening portion 123 and the hardening portion 124, thereby improving characteristics of the deposited film formed on the substrate 101. In this regard, a time corresponding to โimmediatelyโ refers to a time within a range in which a defect does not occur. For example, if a defect does not occur within 5 seconds after the deposition material reaches the substrate 101, โimmediatelyโ refers to a time within 5 seconds, which will be described below. Also, the deposited film may be formed on the entire surface or a desired surface of the substrate 101 by successively performing the above-described operation while moving the substrate 101. In detail, when the organic material monomer is deposited as the deposition material on the substrate 101 via the nozzle 122, since the organic material monomer has liquidity and is hardened after a time since the organic material monomer reached the substrate 101, the organic material monomer may have desired characteristics of a deposited film. Such an organic material monomer film having liquidity before being hardened may affect components (not shown) disposed below the organic material monomer film. In other words, impurities from the organic material monomer may permeate into the components (not shown) disposed below the deposited film to thus contaminate the components. Also, when the organic material monomer having liquidity moves on the substrate 101 before being hardened, the deposited film having a non-uniform shape may be finally formed on the substrate 101, thereby decreasing characteristics of the deposited film. However, in the current embodiment, as soon as the organic material reaches the substrate 101 via the nozzle 122, the organic material monomer is hardened through the hardening portions 123 and 124, and thus, there is no time for impurities to be released from the organic material having reached the substrate 101 and no time for the organic material deposited film to move on the substrate 101. In particular, when the hardening portions 123 and 124 simultaneously harden the organic material monomer, discharged via the nozzle 122, when it reaches the substrate 101, the organic material monomer is rapidly hardened as soon as the organic material monomer film is formed on the substrate 101, and thus there is no time for the organic material monomer film having liquidity to move on the substrate 101. Accordingly, desired characteristics of the deposited film may be easily obtained, and the components disposed below the deposited film are prevented from being contaminated during formation of the deposited film. Also, since the deposition process is performed while moving the substrate 101, even when the deposition process is performed on the entire surface or a desired surface of the substrate 101, the characteristics of the deposited film may be easily obtained and the components disposed below the deposited film are prevented from being contaminated. FIG. 2 is a schematic view of a deposition apparatus according to another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2, a deposition apparatus 200 includes a chamber 210, a deposition source 220, a stage 205, and a driving unit 230. The stage 205 is disposed inside the chamber 210. A substrate 201 is mounted on one surface of the stage 205. A fixing device (not shown) may be used to fix the substrate 201 mounted on the stage 205. The fixing device may be any of various types of devices, for example, a clamp, a pressing device, an adhesive material, or the like. The deposition source 220 faces the substrate 201. The deposition source 220 includes a crucible 221, a nozzle 222, and hardening portions 223 and 224. The crucible 221 accommodates a deposition material (not shown). A heating device, such as a heater (not shown), for heating the deposition material may be disposed around the crucible 221. The nozzle 222 is connected to the crucible 221 so that the deposition material evaporates, is discharged via the nozzle 222, and then moves toward the substrate 201, thereby forming a deposited film on the substrate 201. The hardening portions 223 and 224 are disposed at opposite sides of the nozzle 222. The hardening portion 223 includes a UV irradiation unit 223a and a body 223b. The body 223b generates UV light, and the UV irradiation unit 223a irradiates the generated UV light toward the substrate 201. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the UV irradiation unit 223a and the body 223b may be formed as one body. The hardening portion 224 includes a UV irradiation unit 224a and a body 224b. The body 224b generates UV light, and the UV irradiation unit 224a irradiates the generated UV light toward the substrate 201. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the UV irradiation unit 224a and the body 224b may be formed as one body. The hardening portion 223 and the hardening portion 224 are disposed adjacent to the nozzle 222 to simultaneously harden the deposition material as soon as the deposition material discharged via the nozzle 222 reaches the substrate 201. The driving unit 230 is connected to the deposition source 220. The driving unit 230 may move the deposition source 220 in a first direction (in a direction of an arrow M1) or in a second direction (in a direction of an arrow M2) that is opposite to the first direction, as shown in FIG. 2. Hereinafter, operations and effects of the deposition apparatus 200 of the current embodiment will be simply described. The deposition material is seated on the substrate 201 via the nozzle 222 to form the deposited film on the substrate 201. In particular, when an organic material monomer is accommodated in the crucible 221, the organic material monomer is discharged via the nozzle 222 and reaches the substrate 201. Then, the organic material monomer is hardened through the hardening portions 223 and 224, thereby improving characteristics of the deposited film formed on the substrate 201. Also, desired characteristics of the deposited film may be easily obtained, and the components disposed below the deposited film are prevented from being contaminated during formation of the deposited film. Also, since the deposition process is performed while moving the deposition source 220, even when the deposition process is performed on the entire surface or a desired surface of the substrate 201, the characteristics of the deposited film may be easily obtained and the components disposed below the deposited film are prevented from being contaminated. FIG. 3 is a schematic view of a deposition source and a deposition apparatus including the deposition source according to another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 3, a deposition apparatus 500 includes a chamber 510, a deposition source 520, a stage 505, a driving unit 530, an evaporation apparatus 540, and a liquid material supplying apparatus 550.

Unlike the previous embodiments, a crucible is not formed in the current embodiment. The evaporation apparatus 540 is disposed outside of the chamber 510. The evaporation apparatus 540 receives a deposition material from the liquid material supplying apparatus 550. In detail, a liquid material supplied from the liquid material supplying apparatus 550 moves to the evaporation apparatus 540 via a tube 555. In this regard, the liquid material is atomized to the evaporation apparatus 540 via an atomizer 560 disposed at one end of the tube 555. The deposition material evaporated in the evaporation apparatus 540 through an evaporation process reaches the nozzle 522 through a connecting member 545 and moves toward the substrate 501 from the nozzle 522, thereby forming the deposited film on the substrate 501. The hardening portions 523 and 524 are disposed at opposite sides of the nozzle 522. Although not shown in FIG. 3, the hardening portions 523 and 524 may include a body for generating UV light and an irradiating unit for irradiating UV light toward the substrate 501.

Referring to FIG. 7A, an electrode 310, an intermediate layer 320, an electrode 330, and a buffer layer 340 are formed on a substrate 301. The substrate 301 may be formed of a SiO2-based transparent glass material.

Buffer layer 340 protects electrode 330 disposed under the buffer layer 340. Buffer layer 340 may not be an essential component and may be excluded when required. FIG. 7B is an enlarged view of section B shown in FIG. 7A. Referring to FIG. 7B, the intermediate layer 320 may include exposed surfaces 321. In other words, when the intermediate layer 320 is formed by using a deposition process or any other method, a surface of the intermediate layer 320 may expand due to shapes of the components disposed below the intermediate layer 320 or various other factors or may protrude from a top surface of electrode 310 disposed under the intermediate layer 320. A protruding portion of the intermediate layer 320 may protrude above electrode 330 and buffer layer 340, and thus exposed surfaces 321 of the intermediate layer 320 may be exposed to the outside when not covered by electrode 330 and buffer layer 340. Referring to FIGS. 7C and 7D, an inorganic encapsulation layer 351 is formed on buffer layer 340. FIG. 7D is an enlarged view of section D shown in FIG. 7C. Referring to FIG. 7D, the inorganic encapsulation layer 351 does not completely cover the exposed surfaces 321 of the intermediate layer 320. In other words, the inorganic encapsulation layer 351 may not cover the exposed surfaces 321 of the intermediate layer 320 due to material characteristics and a thickness of the inorganic encapsulation layer 351. The inorganic encapsulation layer 351 may be formed of any of various materials, for example, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, Al-doped zinc oxide (AZO), or the like. Referring to FIGS. 7E and 7F (an enlarged view of section F shown in FIG. 7E), an organic encapsulation layer 361 is formed on the inorganic encapsulation layer 351. In detail, the organic encapsulation layer 361 is formed by using the deposition apparatus 200 shown in FIG. 2. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. That is, the organic encapsulation layer 361 may be formed by using any of the deposition apparatuses shown in FIG. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. In detail, an organic material monomer film for forming the organic encapsulation layer 361 is formed on the inorganic encapsulation layer 351 via the nozzle 222 of deposition source 220. In this regard, the organic material monomer may include acryl, an epoxy-based monomer, or a silicon-based monomer. As soon as the organic material monomer film is formed on the inorganic encapsulation layer 351, the organic material monomer film is immediately hardened by using the hardening portions 223 and 224 simultaneously, thereby forming the organic encapsulation layer 361. Accordingly, an organic material or other impurities may be prevented from penetrating into the intermediate layer 320, particularly, into any exposed surfaces of the intermediate layer 320, from the organic material monomer film. Here, the organic encapsulation layer 361 may be easily formed on the entire surface or a desired surface of the inorganic encapsulation layer 351 by performing a deposition process while moving the deposition source 220 by using the driving unit 230. In this regard, the intermediate layer 320 may be effectively prevented from being damaged through a series of operations of the nozzle 222 and the hardening portions 223 and 224. Referring to FIG. 7G, an inorganic encapsulation layer 352, an organic encapsulation layer 362, an inorganic encapsulation layer 353, an organic encapsulation layer 363, and an inorganic encapsulation layer 354 are sequentially formed, thereby completing formation of the organic light-emitting display. The inorganic encapsulation layer 352, the organic encapsulation layer 362, the inorganic encapsulation layer 353, the organic encapsulation layer 363, and the inorganic encapsulation layer 354 may include at least one of the above-described materials of the inorganic encapsulation layer 351 and the organic encapsulation layer 361. Alternatively, in the present invention, the organic encapsulation layer 363 and the inorganic encapsulation layer 354 may be omitted. Alternatively, the organic encapsulation layer 362, the inorganic encapsulation layer 353, the organic encapsulation layer 363, and the fourth inorganic encapsulation layer 354 may be omitted. In the described organic light-emitting display of FIGS. 7A-7G, intermediate layer 320, electrode 310, and electrode 330 may be effectively protected through a structure in which inorganic encapsulation layers and organic encapsulation layers are stacked on electrode 330. In this regard, the organic encapsulation layer 361 is formed by immediately hardening the organic material monomer film through the hardening portions 223 and 224 (FIG. 2) as soon as the organic material monomer film is formed on the inorganic encapsulation layer 351 via the nozzle 222 (FIG. 2), and thus any exposed surfaces of the intermediate layer 320 may be effectively prevented from being contaminated. FIGS. 8 and 9 are schematic cross-sectional views of another organic light-emitting display manufactured by using any of the deposition apparatuses of FIGS. 1-6. FIG. 9 is an enlarged view of section A shown in FIG. 8. For convenience of description, differences between the previous embodiments and the current embodiment will be mainly described below. An electrode 410 is formed on a substrate 401, and a pixel-defining layer 419 is formed on electrode 410. The pixel-defining layer 419 is formed not to cover at least a part of a top surface of electrode 410. An intermediate layer 420 is formed on electrode 410 and a portion of pixel-defining layer 419. The intermediate layer 420 includes an organic emission layer so as to emit visible light. An electrode 430 is formed on the intermediate layer 420. An inorganic encapsulation layer 451, an organic encapsulation layer 461, an inorganic encapsulation layer 452, an organic encapsulation layer 462, an inorganic encapsulation layer 453, an organic encapsulation layer 463, and an inorganic encapsulation layer 454 are formed on electrode 430. Although not shown in FIG. 8, a buffer layer may be formed on electrode 430 and inorganic encapsulation layer 451. In the described embodiment, a part of the intermediate layer 420 may be uplifted, or protrude, and an extent of the uplift, or protrusion, of the intermediate layer 420 may be great due to the shape of the pixel-defining layer 419 formed under the intermediate layer 420. Thus, the intermediate layer 420 may not be completely covered by electrode 430 and the inorganic encapsulation layer 451. The organic encapsulation layer 461 is then formed on the inorganic encapsulation layer 451. In detail, the organic encapsulation layer 461 is formed by using, for example, the deposition apparatus 100 or the deposition apparatus 200 shown in FIG. 1 or 2, respectively. Accordingly, an organic material or other impurities from an organic material monomer material layer may be prevented from penetrating into the intermediate layer 420, particularly, into any surface that is not covered by electrode 430 and inorganic encapsulation layer 451 from among surfaces of the intermediate layer 420. In the organic light-emitting display of the embodiment of FIG. 8, intermediate layer 420, electrode 410, and electrode 430 may be effectively protected through a structure in which inorganic encapsulation layers and organic encapsulation layers are stacked on electrode 430. In this regard, the organic encapsulation layer 461 is formed by immediately hardening the organic material monomer film as soon as the organic material monomer film is formed on the inorganic encapsulation layer 451, and thus the organic encapsulation layer 461 prevents the intermediate layer 420 from being contaminated. Although not particularly described here, the organic light-emitting display of FIG. 8 may be formed by using any of the deposition apparatuses 500, 600, 700, and 800 shown in FIGS. 3 to 6, respectively. A deposition source, a deposition apparatus, and a method of manufacturing an organic light-emitting display may easily improve characteristics of a deposited film and encapsulation characteristics.
