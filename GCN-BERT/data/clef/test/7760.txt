CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a national stage application filed under 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Application No. PCT/EP2010/005252, filed Aug. 27, 2010, which claims priority from European Application No. 09011294.7, filed Sep. 3, 2009, each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. The present invention relates to a silverware container, especially a silverware tray and/or a silverware basket, for arrangement on a crockery basket of a dishwasher, as well as dishwasher with a silverware container. Silverware containers, for example as a silverware tray with a crockery basket for a dishwasher are, for example, known from DE 43 09 915 C2. The dishwasher described therein comprises a basket, which can be moved between a washing position, in which the basket is located fully inside a washing chamber of the dishwasher, and a loading position, in which the basket is moved out of the washing chamber and can be loaded with dishes to be washed or unloaded when the dishes are clean. The basket comprises two opposite side walls each having a horizontal bar, on which a silverware tray is slidably mounted. Although the silverware tray only covers a certain part of the top of the basket, it has to be frequently moved to fully load/unload the basket, which is annoying for the user. On the one hand it is therefore desired that the tray is rather small so that it always covers only a very small part of the top of the basket. On the other hand it is desired to make the silverware tray as big as possible, so that a large quantity of silverware can be placed on the tray and washed in a single washing process. These are opposing desires, which depend on the quantity of dishes and silverware to be cleaned. However, since this quantity often varies, it is hard to decide whether to prefer a big silverware tray or a small one. Starting from the above mentioned prior art technology it is an object of the present invention to provide a silverware container for arrangement on a crockery basket of a dishwasher and a dishwasher with a silverware container which are easy and flexible to use. This object is solved by a silverware container for arrangement on a crockery basket of a dishwasher, wherein the silverware container comprises two opposing ends that are adapted for arrangement on the upper ends of two opposing side walls of the crockery basket or the silverware container is adapted for arrangement on the bottom of the crockery basket, characterized in that the silverware container comprises a bottom wall for supporting the silverware that comprises at least two essentially horizontal segments that are arranged telescopably relative to each other. This silverware container according to the invention allows a very simple and robust construction. Furthermore, as it comprises at least two essentially horizontal segments that are arranged telescopably relative to each other, the arrangement of the two essentially horizontal segments can be adapted as currently needed so that the silverware container is very flexible to use. Preferably, the silverware container is a cutlery container and/or a container for knifes, forks and spoons, which not necessarily need to be made of or contain silver. Instead, the cutlery can also be made of other metal, metal compounds, metal alloys, plastics or other suitable materials. Preferably, the horizontal segments of its or the bottom wall are telescopably perpendicularly to its opposing ends that are adapted for arrangement on the upper ends of the opposing side walls of the crockery basket. This allows an easy telescoping of the silverware container. In an advantageous embodiment, at least its or the bottom wall comprises openings, in particular slots, through holes and/or mesh holes so that water can get into and/or out of the silverware container. This improves the rinsing quality when the silverware container is sprayed with rinsing liquid and/or water. Preferably, at least the area of the bottom wall, in particular in addition the area of two opposing side walls of the silverware container, can be adapted by telescoping at least the telescopable horizontal segments of the bottom wall. In case the area of the bottom wall can be adapted, the area which is necessary for the silverware container can be selected as small as necessary for placing the silverware in it, so that the area which is left for other items can be maximized. Preferably, the silverware container is a silverware tray or a silverware basket for arrangement on a crockery basket of dishwasher. A silverware tray reduces or minimises the height which is necessary for placing the silverware, whereas a silverware basket increases or maximizes the amount of silverware which can be placed into the basket. Preferably, the silverware container is a silverware tray, a) that comprises a first guiding means and a second guiding means that are arranged respectively at opposing ends of the silverware tray as well as at least two tray elements that comprise the telescopable horizontal segments of its bottom wall,b) wherein the first guiding means is supported and telescopably arranged on the upper end of the first side wall of the crockery basket and the second guiding means is supported and telescopably arranged on the upper end of the second side wall of the crockery basket,c) whereas the size of the silverware tray is variable by telescoping the tray elements perpendicularly to the opposing ends of the silverware tray and using the guiding means as telescopic guidance. In this case, the silverware container can be arranged at the upper end of the crockery basket so that the lower area of the crockery basket can be used for other items whereas the silverware can be placed above these items. Furthermore, the guiding means allow easy telescoping of the tray elements. Preferably, both the first and the second guiding means each comprises two elongated halves that are slidably arranged in parallel and/or concentrically to each other, preferably wherein the two halves of each guiding means are arranged on two neighbouring tray elements at corresponding ends thereof. Preferably, the first guiding means is supported and telescopably arranged on a first upper side wire of the first side wall of the crockery basket, and/or the second guiding means of the silverware tray is supported and telescopably arranged on a second upper side wire of the second side wall of the crockery basket, wherein the upper side wire of the crockery basket extends at least essentially along the upper side of the respective side wall thereof, preferably at least substantially horizontally, preferably wherein the tray elements are telescopably along the first and the second side wire of the crockery basket. The upper side wires allow a safe guidance of the silverware container. Furthermore, in many cases, the upper side wires are existing anyway so that the guidance can be manufactured with at least relatively low or even no additional costs. Preferably, the guiding means guide the movement of the tray elements, both relatively to each other and relatively to the first and second side wall of the cutlery basket, in particular wherein at least one guiding means encompasses an upper side wire of the crockery basket. In this embodiment, the guiding means are therefore used in two different ways which can reduce the number of parts and the amount of space which is necessary and which can also reduce the manufacturing costs. Preferably, at least one of the guiding means comprises an abutment means for detachably arranging the silverware tray on a side wall, preferably on an upper side wire, of the crockery basket, wherein preferably at least one abutment means comprises at least one recess, which is resiliently clipable on a side wall, in particular on an upper side wire, of the crockery basket, and/or at least one of the guiding means is pivotably engaged with one of the opposing side walls, in particular with one upper side wire, of the crockery basket, and/or at least one of the guiding means comprises a stopper for limiting the movement of at least one tray element relative to a neighbouring tray element or relative to the first or second side wall of the crockery basket. Preferably, the silverware tray can be arranged on a crockery basket, a) wherein at least one of the side walls of the crockery basket, in particular at least one of the upper side wires thereof, comprises a stop at at least one of its ends for limiting the sliding movement of the silverware tray,b) wherein preferably the stops are provided as upwardly extending sections of the upper side wire. Therefore, a sliding movement to a or within an unintended range can be avoided. Preferably, the silverware container is a silverware basket, a) comprising a bottom wall, a front wall and a back wall and two opposing side walls,b) wherein the size of the silverware basket is, preferably horizontally, variable by telescoping the bottom wall and preferably the two side walls. Preferably, the silverware basket a) comprises at least two basket halves, each basket half comprising a telescopable horizontal segment of the bottom wall of the silverware basket and either the front wall or the back wall thereof and a telescopable segment of at least one side wall thereof, preferably two telescopable segment of two opposing side walls,b) wherein the basket halves are shiftable into each other to form the silverware basket and/orc) wherein the basket halves are telescopable with respect to each other for varying the size of the silverware basket, in particulard) wherein an additional intermediate basket part that comprises two opposing side walls and a base area can be arranged between the two basket halves. Preferably, the silverware basket comprises a linear guidance in a side wall and/or in the bottom wall. This improves the guidance of the telescoping movement. Preferably, at least one of the side walls, the front wall and/or the back wall in addition to the bottom wall comprise openings, in particular slots, through holes and/or mesh holes so that water can get into and/or out of the silverware basket. This can improve the rinsing quality, as more water and/or rinsing agent can pass the silverware. Preferably, at least one of the front walls and/or the back wall has a height that is adapted to hold the silverware at least essentially in an upright position. This allows an easy loading and unloading of the container. Preferably, the silverware basket comprises a handle which spans between the two opposite side walls. This allows an easy carrying of the container. Furthermore, the invention relates to a dishwasher comprising a crockery basket comprising a silverware container, a silverware tray and/or a silverware basket according to at least one of the invention.

The dishwasher basket (or: crockery basket) 2 comprises a bottom 2A and a front and a rear side wall 3, 4 (or: side mesh) having respective horizontal bars (or: upper side wires) 5, 6 extending along their length. The horizontal bars 5, 6 are upwardly bent at their lateral ends to form stops 5A and 6A. The horizontal bars 5, 6 slidably receive the tray 1, whereas the stops 5A, 6A limit the sliding movement of the tray 1 along the bars 5, 6 in both directions. The silverware tray 1 which is also shown in FIGS. 2 to 7, is made of plastic material. In its central tray area on the bottom wall 18 with telescopable horizontal segments 18A and 18B it is provided with upright pins 7, which are arranged in lines for receiving the silverware 8, 9, which is represented by a knife 8 and a spoon 9. The pins 7 separate the silverware 8, 9 so that it can reliably be washed. The tray 1, which is best shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, comprises two tray elements 10, 12, which are telescopably connected to each other at those lateral ends, which are slidably received by the side walls 3, 4 of the basket 2. Accordingly, the size of the tray 1 can be varied by telescoping the tray elements 10, 12 along the horizontal bars 5, 6. The telescopable connection of the tray elements 10, 12 is realized by guiding means 14A, 16A; 14B, 16B, which are best seen in FIG. 5. The guiding means 14A, 16A; 14B, 16B, are provided in the form of essentially U-shaped profiles, which are guided into each other, whereas the outer profile encompasses the inner profile in order to hold it. Four stoppers 20, 22, 24, 26, are arranged at the ends of the guiding means 14A, 16A; 14B, 16B, to limit the movement of the tray elements 10, 12 relative to each other in both telescoping directions. The tray 1 comprises fixing means or abutment means 30A, 30B, which are provided at the bottom side of the guiding means 14A, 16A; 14B, 16B, as best shown in FIG. 4.
