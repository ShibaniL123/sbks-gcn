This application claims the benefit of Indian provisional application number 2661/CHE/2012 filed on Jul. 3, 2012 which hereby incorporated by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to novel “3-(pyrazolyl)-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives of formula (I), as protein kinase inhibitors. BACKGROUND Protein Kinases are key regulators of cell function that constitute one of the largest and most functionally diverse gene families. Protein kinases participate in the signalling events that control the activation, growth and differentiation of cells in response to extracellular mediators and to changes in the environment. In general, these protein kinases fall into several groups; those which preferentially phosphorylate serine and/or threonine residues and those which preferentially phosphorylate tyrosine residues. Protein kinases play crucial role in regulating the different cell processes which include, but are not limited to, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, transcription, translation, signalling process and various regulatory mechanisms, by adding phosphate groups to the target protein residues. This phosphorylation event acts as molecular on/off switches that can modulate or regulate the target position biological function. Phosphorylation of targeted proteins occurs in response to a variety of extracellular signals. The appropriate protein kinase functions in signaling pathways to activate or deactivate. Uncontrolled signaling due to defective control of protein phosphorylation is known to contribute to various diseases. In the case of cancer, kinases are known to regulate many aspects of the cell growth, invasion that intrudes upon and destroys adjacent tissues and sometimes metastasis, or spreading to other locations in the body via lymph or blood. The protein kinase family members include enzymes that control cell growth, migration, activation, proliferation, differentiation, signaling, survival and regulation of the cell cycle. Many diseases and/or disorders are associated with aberrant, abnormal or deregulated activity of one or more kinases. These diseases and/or disorders include, but are not limited to cancers, allergic diseases and/or disorders, autoimmune diseases and/or disorders, inflammatory diseases and/or disorder and/or conditions associated with inflammation and pain, proliferative diseases, hematopoietic disorders, hematological malignancies, bone disorders, fibrosis diseases and/or disorders, metabolic disorders, muscle diseases and/or disorders respiratory diseases and/or disorders, pulmonary disorders, genetic developmental diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases/or disorders, chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies, cardiovascular, vascular or heart diseases and/or disorders, ophthalmic/ocular diseases and/or disorders, wound repair, infection and viral diseases. Therefore, inhibition of one or more of kinases would have multiple therapeutic indications. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) also known as ALK tyrosine kinase receptor or CD246 (cluster of differentiation 246) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ALK gene. The most abundant expression of ALK occurs in the neonatal brain, suggesting a possible role for ALK in brain development (Duyster, J. et al., Oncogene, 2001, 20, 5623-5637). ALK is implicated in oncogenesis in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tumors. Approximately sixty percent of anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) are associated with a chromosome mutation that generates a fusion protein consisting of nucleophosmin (NPM) and the intracellular domain of ALK. This mutant protein, NPM-ALK, possesses a constitutively active tyrosine kinase domain that is responsible for its oncogenic property through activation of downstream effectors. In addition, the transforming EML4-ALK fusion gene has been identified in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (Soda, M., et al., Nature, 2007, 448,561-566) and represents another in a list of ALK fusion proteins that are promising targets for ALK inhibitor therapy. Experimental data have demonstrated that the aberrant expression of constitutively active ALK is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of ALCL and that inhibition of ALK can markedly impair the growth of ALK+ lymphoma cells. The constitutively activated chimeric ALK has also been demonstrated in about 60% of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs), a slow-growing sarcoma that mainly affects children and young adults. Furthermore, the aberrant expression of full-length ALK receptor proteins has been reported in neuroblastomas and extremely virulent glioblastomas (brain cancer). ALK and its putative ligand, pleiotrophin, are overexpressed in human glioblastomas (Stoica, G. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2001, 276, 16772-16779). In mouse studies, depletion of ALK reduced glioblastoma tumor growth and prolonged animal survival (Powers, C. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2002, 277, 14153-14158). More recently, a novel oncogenic ALK fusion, EML4-ALK, comprising portions of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene, has been implicated in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells forced to express this fusion tyrosine kinase generated transformed foci in culture and subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. The EML4-ALK fusion transcript was detected in 6.7% of the 75 NSCLC patients examined; these individuals were distinct from those harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. These findings strongly suggest that EML4-ALK and TPM4-ALK fusions are promising candidates for a therapeutic target in a sizable subset of NSCLC and possibly in some esophageal carcinomas. An ALK inhibitor would either permit durable cures when combined with current chemotherapy for ALCL, IMT, or glioblastoma, or be used as a single therapeutic agent in a maintenance role to prevent cancer recurrence in those patients. Various ALK inhibitors have been reported, including amino substituted pyrimidines (WO/2009/032703A1), triazine and pyrimidine compounds (WO/2009/126514), and pyrimidine compounds (WO/2011/143033A1). Accordingly, a need exists for the identification of small-molecule compounds that specifically inhibit, regulate and/or modulate the signal transduction of kinases, particularly ALK, as a means to treat or prevent associated diseases.

Pharmacological Activity ALK Wild Type (WT) The ALK WT cell free assay was set up to evaluate the effects of these compounds as inhibitors of ALK enzyme. The enzymatic assay was standardized using recombinant human ALK enzyme (Cat#08-518) from Carna Biosciences using Ultra Light Poly GT (Cat# TRF 0100D) from Perkin Elmer as a substrate. TR-FRET (Time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer) detection technology was used for the read out. The final assay conditions were 50 mM HEPES pH 7.1, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.01% BSA, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM Na3 VO4, 40 nM Ultra Light Poly GT, 2.5 ng ALK WT enzyme, 1 μM ATP and 125 nM Lance Eu-W1024 labeled anti phospho tyrosine antibody (Cat# AD0203, Perkin Elmer) in 384 well format. The assay reaction time with the substrate was 30 minutes after which the antibody detection mix is added. The TR-FRET signal (Excitation at 340 nm, Emission at 615 nm and 665 nm) was read with 50 μs delay time on Victor3 V fluorimeter. The data is calculated using the ratio of reading at 665 nM to 615 nM. The final concentration of DMSO was 1% in the assay. Compounds were screened at 100 nM and 1 μM concentrations with pre-incubation of the enzymes with compound for 30 minutes. Each individual IC50 was determined using 10 point dose response curve generated by GraphPad Prism software Version 4 (San Diego, Calif., USA) using non linear regression curve fit for sigmoidal dose response (variable slope). The compounds prepared were tested using the above assay procedure and the results obtained are given in Table-8. Percentage inhibition at concentrations of 100 nM and 1.0 μM are given in table along with the IC50 (nM) details for selected examples. The IC50 values of the compounds are set forth in Table-8 wherein “A” refers to an IC50 value of less than 50 nM, “B” refers to IC50 value in range of 50.01 to 250 nM and “C” refers to IC50 value of greater than 250 nM.
