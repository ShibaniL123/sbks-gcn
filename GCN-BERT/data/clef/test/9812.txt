HER2/NEU CANCER VACCINE FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to protein conjugate comprising a protein antigen from the extracellular domain of Her2/Neu or a protein antigen having a high sequence identity or similarity to a certain portion of the extracellular domain of Her2/Neu. The invention also relates to the protein antigen. The protein conjugate comprises the protein antigen, and, covalently bonded to the protein antigen, an immunogenic carrier. The protein conjugate or the protein antigen can be used as a cancer vaccine for Her2/Neu positive cancers. The invention further provides a cancer vaccine against Her2/Neu positive cancers. The cancer vaccine contains the protein conjugate or the protein antigen and suitable adjuvants and/or pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The invention also provides a method of preventing and/or treating Her2/neu positive cancers using the cancer vaccine. Further provided is a process of producing the protein conjugate. Further, the invention relates to a nucleic acid encoding the protein antigen, and a kit for producing the protein conjugate. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Her2, also known as Neu, ErbB-2, or ρ185, is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB) family and encoded by the ERBB2 gene. Herein, the terms “HER2” or “Her2” and “Her2/neu” are used interchangeably. As other members of ErbB family, Her2 is a membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinases composed of extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain that can interact with downstream signaling molecules. Unlike the other family members, HER2 is considered to be an orphan receptor as it has no known ligand. HER2 can heterodimerise with other ErbB family receptors and is considered to be their preferred dimerisation partner. Dimerisation results in the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors and initiates a variety of signaling pathways leading to proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. Amplification of the ERBB2 gene occurs in 20-30% of human breast and ovarian cancers and is linked to a more aggressive disease course and worse prognosis (Bange, J., Zwick Ε. & Ullrich A., 2001, Nature Medicine, 7: 548-552; Slamon, D.J., Clark, G.M., Wong, S.G. et al., 1987’ Science,235:177-182: Slamon, D.J., Godolphin, W., Jones, L.A. et al., 1989, Science,244:707-712; Berchuck, A., Kamel, A., Whitaker. R., et al., 1990, Cancer Research 50:4087-4091). In ERBB2+ tumor cells, the receptor can function on its own and/or it needs to heterodimerize with another ErbB member to transduce a deregulated proliferative signal responsible for the neoplastic behavior of the cells. In recent years HER2 has evolved as an important target for therapy of breast cancer in particular by monoclonal antibody therapy, e.g. Herceptin (trastuzumab) a humanized monoclonal antibody against this surface target has been approved by FDA in 1998. Herceptin has a significant impact on survival rates of HER2 positive breast cancer patients (Tan, A. R. & Swain, S.M., 2002, Seminars in Oncology, 30: 54-64). Although active against HER2 homodimers, trastuzumab is not effective against ligand-induced HER2 heterodimers (Agus, D.B., Akita, R.W,, Fox, W.D., et al., 2002, Cancer Cell, 2:127-137; Cho, H.S., Mason, Κ., Ramyar, Κ.Χ,, et al., 2003, Nature,421:756-60). In addition, cancers usually develop resistance to trastuzumab (Cho, H.S., Mason, Κ., Ramyar, Κ.Χ., et al., 2003, Nature, 421:756-760). While trastuzumab is efficient for the treatment of late stage metastatic cancers, it is not clear if it is effective in earlier stage cancers (Editorial, 2005, Lancet, 366:1673). In June 2012, the FDA approved yet another monoclonal antibody pertuzumab (US7449184; US7981418) for treatment of HER2/neu positive metastatic breast cancer in combination with Herceptin® (trastuzumab) and docetaxel chemotherapy for patients who have not received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease (Genentech press release on 08 June, 2012 http://www.gene.com/gene/news/pressreleases/display.do?method=detail&id=14007). This approach allowed extending patient’s cancer progression-free period for median 6.1 months. As an alternative or complementation to HER2/neu-positive cancers treatment with therapeutic antibodies, different cancer vaccines are currently under testing. This approach provides the most dramatic shift in cancer treatment, as patient’s own immune system could be trained to recognise and delete HER2-positive cancer cells. Different vaccine designs (simple peptides, DNA encoding HER2 regions, HER2 protein fragments and whole-cell vaccines) have been tested in human clinical trials that have shown that significant levels of durable humoral or T-cell HER2 immunity can be generated with active immunization (Ladjemi, Μ.Ζ., Jacot, W., Charde’s, Τ. et al., 2010, Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 59:1295-1312). The most advanced clinical studies are with peptide-based vaccines, especially the one based on Ε75 peptide (Disis, M.L., & Κ Schiffman, Κ., 2001, Semin Oncol., 28:12-20; Murray, J.L., Gillogly, Μ.Ε., Przepiorka, D. et al., 2002, Clin Cancer Res., 8^3407-3418; Peoples, G.E., Gurney, J.M., Hueman, Μ.Τ., et al., 2005, J Clin Oncol 23:7536-7545; Ross, J.S., Slodkowska, Ε.Α., Symmans, W.F., et al., 2009, The Oncologist, 14:320-368; US 8,222,214; for review see Ladjemi, ΜΖ., Jacot, W., Chardes, Τ. et al., 2010, Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 59:1295-1312). This vaccination can break tolerance against endogenous HER2 receptor. The key component of the vaccine is peptide Ε75, a peptide of 9-amino acid residues (US 8,222,214; Mittendorf, Ε.Α., Clifton, G.T., Holmes, J.P. et al., 2012, Cancer,118:2594-602). Cancer vaccines do not usually cause toxicities typically associated with the use of therapeutic antibodies or chemotherapeutics (e.g. Peoples, G.E., Gurney, J.M., Hueman, Μ.Τ., et at., 2005, J. Clin. Oncol., 23:7536-7545; Ross, J.S., Slodkowska, Ε.Α., Symmans, W.F., et at., 2009, The Oncologist, 14:320-368: Dabney, R.S., Hale, D.F., Vreeland, T.J., et al., 2012, J. Clin. Oncol, 30 (ASCO suppl; abstr 2529); Hamilton, Ε., Blackwell, Κ., Hobeika, A.C., et al., 2012, J. Transl. Med., 10:28). Also, no significant toxic autoimmunity directed against normal tissues has been encountered with vaccines (Bernhard, Η., Salazar, L., Schiffman, Κ. et al., 2002, Endocr Relat Cancer 9:33-44; Ladjemi, Μ.Ζ., Jacot, W., Charde’s, Τ. etal., 2010, Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 59:1295-1312). Most of these vaccines focus on T-cell immunity and consist of peptides or mixes of a small number of epitopes, necessitating patient cohorts to be HLA-matched at enrollment, and consequently exhibit a narrow immune response (Ladjemi, Μ.Ζ., Jacot, W., Charde’s, Τ. et al., 2010, Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 59:1295-1312). In addition to a narrow spectrum of target sites for peptide vaccines, use of peptidebased vaccines might suffer from difficulties in identification of the most promising peptides. Peptide vaccines cause immune response limited to one or few peptides in the composition. A promising alternative are DNA vaccines that are easy to manufacture but, while they are superior to peptides in inducing CD8+ T-cell responses (Chaise, C., Buchan, S.L., Rice, J. et al., 2008, Blood,112:2956-2964: Rolla, S., Marchini, C., Malinarich, S. et al., 2008, Human Gene Therapy, 19:229-239; US8207141), they are typically less effective than protein vaccines in inducing antibody responses. Clinical trials with HER2 protein-based vaccines were also carried out. In one case, the HER2 ICD (intra-cellular domain, aa 676-1255) was used as an adjuvant vaccine (Disis, M.L., Schiffman, Κ., Guthrie, Κ. etal., 2004, J. Clin. Oncol.. 22:1916-1925). It was shown that the vaccine was well tolerated and the patients treated with the highest dose more rapidly developed immunity. No therapeutic effect was reported. Phase I clinical trials with dHER2 consisting of the complete extracellular domain (ECD) and a portion of the intracellular domain (ICD) in combination with a complex mix of adjuvants and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Lapatinib showed no (cardio) toxic effect, but also showed weak T-cell responses and 55 days median time to progression (Hamilton, Ε., Blackwell, Κ., Hobeika, A.C. et al., 2012, J. Trans. Med., 10:28, http://www.translationalmedicine.com/content/10/1/28). Use of a portion of a HER2 ECD domain (aa 1-146) complexed with cholesteryl pullulan nanogels (CHP-HER2) was well tolerated by patients and induced T-cell responses to the truncated HER2 protein (Kitano, S., Kageyama, S., Nagata, Υ. et al., 2006, Clin. Cancer. Res., 12:7397-7405). However, second trials with the same antigen showed that induced Abs (antibodies) did not recognize the HER2 antigen expressed in its native form at the surface of cancer cells (Kageyama, S., Kitano, S., Hirayama, Μ. et al., 2008, Cancer Sci., 99:601-6070). Combination of CHP-HER2 with yet another tumor-specific antigen, NY-ESO-1, did not lead to the improved immune responses. On contrary, there were weaker antibody responses to HER2 in the combination vaccine compared to CHP-HER2 alone (Aoki, Μ., Ueda, S., Nishikawa, Η. et al., 2009, Vaccine, 27:6854-6861). In summary, existing vaccines under development suffer from several limitations (Ladjemi, Μ.Ζ., Jacot, W., Charde’s, Τ. et al., 2010, Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 59:1295-1312): whole tumor cell vaccines must be made individually, the (an) immune response difficult to monitor and there is a risk of auto-immunity induction in the presence of adjuvant; DNA vaccines carry a risk of potentially promoting the malignancy due to DNA integration into the cell genome; peptide vaccines generate immune response limited to one or few epitopes, can be degraded in the absence of adjuvant, have restricted HLA population; HER2 protein-based vaccines up to now have not shown significant therapeutic effect. Esserman et al., Cancer Immunol. Immunother (1999) 47: 337-342 relates to vaccination of neu transgenic mice with the extracellular domain (ECD) of HER2. The authors report that immunization with the Neu ECD delayed the onset of tumor growth. However, the authors also report that once tumors began to grow, they appeared to do so at the same rate as those in the control immunized mice, i.e. without the Neu ECD antigen. Schwaninger et al., Cancer Immunol. Immunother (2004) 53: 1005-1017 describe virosomes as a carrier system for Her2/neu cancer vaccines. Mice vaccinated with the extracellular domain (ECD) of the Her2/neu protein bound to virosomes generated a humoral and cytotoxic immune response. However, once tumors were formed in their mouse model, vaccination had no influence on tumor progression, i.e. had no therapeutic effect. Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide a protein conjugate suitable as a cancer vaccine for HER2/neu positive cancer. It is another object to provide a protein antigen and a protein conjugate that has a therapeutic effect on HER2 positive cancer. It is another object to provide a protein conjugate or cancer vaccine capable to eliciting a longterm T-cell dependent immune response.

Figure 12: TMV-CPLys containing Tobacco Mosaic Virus particles. Schematic representation of the TMV-based vector for production of TMV-CPLys containing tobacco mosaic virus particles. The sequence of CPLys is shown (SEQ ID NO: 16) (accession number for wild-type CP: Q88922) and the extension at the N-terminus containing the lysine residue (ADFK) is indicated in bold and underlined. Expression of this viral construct in Nicotiana benthamiana leads to the formation of CPLys containing Tobacco Mosaic Virus particles. Figure 13: Schematic map of a TMV-based viral binary vector (magnICON® system). The backbone elements of the binary vector are a pVS1 origin for plasmid replication in Agrobacterium, a colE1 origin for plasmid replication in Ε. coli and a nptlll kanamycin antibiotic resistance gene for selection. For delivery of TMV-based viral vectors to plant cells, Agrobacterium tumefaciens is used. Therefore, the complete viral construct was cloned between the T-DNA left and right borders of the binary vector. The viral construct consists of the viral cDNA which encodes a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and the Movement Protein (ΜΡ). For efficient expression plant introns were added within the RdRP and ΜΡ sequences. The gene for the coat protein was removed and is replaced by the gene of interest in the final expression vector. The viral construct also contains the 5' and 3' non-translated (NTR) viral sequences which are essential for replication. For efficient expression of the viral RNA in plant cells, the viral cDNA has been cloned between a plant promoter and a plant terminator (Act2 and nos). To facilitate blue/white selection a lacZa cassette was inserted between two Bsal restriction sites which allow seamless in frame cloning of the gene of interest. All naturally occurring Bsal recognition sites were removed. Figure 14: Schematic representation of experimental design for evaluation of Her2-ED44-based vaccines made in Nicotiana benthamiana. Separate groups of Balb/c mice are immunised with 50 pg of rat Her2-ED44-His vaccine or conjugate vaccines Her2ED44-FrC or Her2ED44-TMV (both contain an equivalent amount of Her2-ED44). All Her2ED44-containing vaccines were combined with an equal volume of alum adjuvant (Sigma) and a total of 200 pL of alum absorbed vaccines are administered s.c. into two sites in the flank. For the control vaccine, 130 pg of plant expressed irrelevant protein (5T33lg-hkappa-Fragment C fusion protein made by ICON) are given as above. A DNA vaccine (50 pg) encoding the Her2/neu full length extracellular plus transmembrane domains (EC-TM) (Prof. Forni, University of Turin, Italy; Quagliino, Ε., Mastini, C., Forni, G. et al., 2008, Curr. Protoc. Immunol., Ch. 20: Unit 20.9.1-20.9-10) was administered i.m. into a separate group of mice to serve as a comparator vaccine. At least five mice per group were vaccinated per each experiment. Each group of mice received a second injection of the same amount of the homologous vaccines three weeks (D21) after the first injection. The mice were bled 3 weeks after the first injection and before the second injection and two times after second injection with two weeks interval between the bleedings (week 5 and week 7). The sample were analysed by ELISA for reactivity against Her2-ED44 and for reactivity against membrane bound Her2/Neu using the TUBO tumour cell line expressing rat Her2 (Neu) or the D2F2/E2 tumour cell line expressing human Her2. In tumour challenge experiments mice previously injected with two doses of the vaccines were challenged with either the TUBO cell or D2F2/E2 cells. 105 cells per mouse were injected s.c. in the flank in each instance 7 week after the last injection of the vaccines.

Evaluation of the ability of antibodies induced by huED44-FrC conjugate vaccine to inhibit Her2-mediated signaling in vitro in comparison with Herceptin and PI3K (downstream of Her2 signalling) inhibitor LY294002. The Her2 positive human Breast cancer cell line ΒΤ474 was treated separately with serum from mice vaccinated with huED44-FrC, control vaccine, Herceptin at dilutions indicated or LY294002 (30μΜ), inhibits Akt phosphorylation (Cell signalling)). Western blot analysis was performed after treatments as indicated using antibody to either phosphorylated Akt (Ser473, top panel), total Akt (middle panel) or B-actin (bottom panel). The human HER2 positive breast cancer cell line ΒΤ474 was separately incubated with pooled serum samples from vaccinated mice at dilutions indicated, trastuzumab (Herceptin®, Roche, UK) or 30μΜ LY294002 inhibotor (Cell Signalling Tecnology, Massachusetts, USA) for 1 hour. All treatments were carried out in complete DMEM media supplemented with 10% FCS at 37°C, 10% C02. After the incubation, the cells were harvested, lysed and 10 pg of protein per sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE® Novex® 4-12% Bis-Tris Gels, Invitrogen Life Technologies, California, USA) after denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes. Following the electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Amersham Hybond™-P, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and after blocking in 5% non-fat milk in Tris buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1% Tween® 20, (TBS-T) were incubated sequentially with anti-pAkt (rabbit anti-phosphor-Akt (Ser 473) antibody, Cell Signalling Technologies), Akt (rabbit anti-Akt antibody, Cell Signalling Technologies) or p-actin (mouse anti-human p-actin antibody, clone 2F1-1, BioLegend) antibody at 1/1,000 dilution. Before applying each subsequent antibody the previous antibody was stripped. After washing 3 times with TBS-Τ prior the membranes were incubated with 1/1,000 in TBS-T of the HRP- conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, Cell Signalling Technologies or anti-mouse IgG (Gamma)(AFF)-PEROX, The Binding Site, Birmingham, UK) for 1 hour at room temperature. The membrane was washed 3 times with TBS-T again before c detection with the SuperSignal™ West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Illinois, USA). The chemiluminescent signal was captured using Bio-Rad imaging system (Fluor-S® Multilmager, Bio-Rad). Figure 20: Rat ED44 Her2-FrC study TUBO model: prophylactic setting. Experimental design and testing of the rat ED44-FrC conjugate vaccine and unconjugated rat ED44 in the TUBO model of a prophylactic setting. Both vaccines induced highly significant protection against the tumour challenge (top left panel) which was similar to the EC-TM DNA vaccine (gift from Prof. Forni, University of Turin, Italy; Quagliino, Ε., Mastini, C., Forni, G. et al., 2008, Curr. Protoc. Immunol., Ch. 20: Unit 20.9.1-20.9-10). This protection was accompanied by induction of antibodies to Her2 ED44 by both vaccines, with the levels in each case being significantly higher than those induced by the DNA vaccine (top right panel). The induced antibody also bound to the native Her2 expressed on the surface of TUBO cells (bottom panel).

A - Protocol for vaccinations and sample collections for experiments in therapeutic setting of a metastatic breast cancer (Balb-NeuT model). Schematic presentation of the experiment in the therapeutic setting. 10-11 weeks old Balb-NeuT female mice (the age when they develop multiple cancinomas with micrometastasis to the bone marrow and lungs) were vaccinated with the same amounts and formulation of the rat ED44, ED44-FrC vaccines or the EC-TM DNA (control vaccine, Quagliino, Ε., Mastini, C., Forni, G. et al., 2008, Curr. Protoc. Immunol., Ch. 20: Unit 20.9.1-20.9-10) as for the TUBO model following the protocol for vaccination and bleeding as indicated. The Balb-NeuT mice were terminated if combined tumour size reached 15 mm. Results of the experiment are shown in Β. Β, Balb-NeuT model transgenic: therapeutic setting of breast carcinoma with metastasis ED44-FrC generated significant protection from the tumor whereas unconjugated vaccine ED44 or the EC-TM DNA vaccines failed to generate significant protection (top panel). ED44-FrC vaccine also induced significantly higher IgG antibody levels than ED44 or the EC-TM DNA vaccines (bottom left panel). The affinity of Her2ED44 specific antibody in the ED44-FrC-vaccinated mice was significantly higher than in the ED44-vaccinated mice (bottom right panel). Antibody affinity was measured using a chaotropic ELISA. Hence conjugate ED44-FrC vaccine in therapeutic setting induces higher anti-Her2 antibody levels and affinity than unconjugated or EC-TM DNA vaccine. EC-TM DNA vaccine is from G. Forni’s laboratory (University of Turin, Italy).

Ten-eleven weeks old Balb-NeuT female mice (the age when they develop multiple carcinomas with micrometastasis to the bone marrow and lungs) were vaccinated with the 50 pg ratED44 or 70 pg ED44-TMV vaccines with alum following the protocol for vaccination and bleeding as for the TUBO model. ED44-TMV vaccine induced higher IgG antibody levels than ED44. The affinity of Her2ED44 specific antibody in the ED44-TMV-vaccinated mice was also higher than in the ED44-vaccinated mice. Both IgG levels and antibody affinity were measured at week 5 after the first injection. Antibody affinity was measured using a chaotropic ELISA. Quaglino Ε, Mastini C, Forni G, Cavallo F.

Curr Protoc Immunol. 2008 Aug; chapter 20: Unit 20.9.1-20.9-10. doi: 10.1002/0471142735. im2009s82. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The protein conjugate of the invention is a conjugate between the protein antigen and the immunogenic carrier (also referred to simply as “carrier”). In the conjugate of the invention, the protein antigen and the carrier are cross-linked, which means that they are linked by at least one covalent chemical bond. However, there may be multiple covalent bonds between one molecule of a protein antigen and a carrier particle or carrier molecule. The protein antigen is a protein that may consist of one amino acid sequence. The purpose of the protein antigen is to generate a polyclonal immune response against the extracellular domain of HER2/Neu. The purpose of the carrier is to generate a durable humoral or Τ celldependent immunity against HER2/Neu and to overcome tolerance against HER2/Neu. Thus, the protein conjugate can bring about a broad and durable humoral or Τ celldependent immunity against HER2/Neu positive cancers. The human HER2 protein of 1255 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 18) has an N-terminal extracellular domain that is defined herein as to extend up to and including amino acid 653, a transmembrane domain of amino acids 654 to 675, and a C-terminal intracellular domain (ICD) from amino acids 676 to 1255 of SEQ ID NO: 18. In the present invention, the protein antigen is a protein comprising or consisting of a segment that can elicit an immune response against the HER2/Neu protein when the protein conjugate or the protein antigen is administered to a patient as a vaccine. This segment is also referred to herein as “first segment”. Herein, a segment is a portion in the linear amino acid sequence of a protein. The protein antigen may consist of a segment that can elicit an immune response against the HER2/Neu protein. Generally, however, the protein antigen contains further portions or segments in addition to the segment that can elicit the immune response against the HER2/Neu protein. Such further portions or segments may be portions that function as a signal peptide or portions that allow easy purification of expressed protein antigen, such as a purification tag. Purification tags, and other portions, may be linked via linker peptides to the remainder of the protein antigen, whereby the linker may allow cleavage of the tags. Examples of purification tags are the 6χ His-tag or the constant portion of an antibody light chain. The light chain may be a kappa light chain or a lambda light chain. The light chain is preferably taken from the species to be vaccinated. Since the main purpose of the invention is vaccination of humans, light chains from human antibodies are preferably used as purification tags. Preferred purification tags are the constant regions from antibody light chains, since they are abundant in the bloodstream of patients and therefore generally do not cause any adverse reactions. Thus, such purification tags do not need to be cleaved off from the protein antigen after expression and purification of the protein antigen. Herein, the segment (of the protein antigen) that can elicit an immune response against the HER2/Neu protein has a substantial length in order to generate a polyclonal immune response, preferably against multiple epitopes of the ECD of HER2/Neu. For this purpose, the protein antigen has a segment of substantial length taken from the ECD of the HER2/Neu protein or a segment of substantial length having a high sequence similarity or identity to a segment from the ECD of the HER2/Neu protein. The length of the segment is at least 300 amino acid residues, preferably at least 320 amino acid residues. The length is preferably at most 600 amino acids, preferably at most 500, and more preferably at most 400 amino acid residues. In other preferred embodiments, the length is from 300 to 400 amino acids, or from 320 to 370 amino acids. In even more preferred embodiments, the length of this segment is from 330 to 360 or from 337 to 350 amino acid residues. In the examples, the segment having 344 amino acids is used, which is referred to herein as “ED44”, wherein “44” indicates the molecular of 44 kDa and “ED” stands for “extracellular domain”. The segment that can elicit an immune response against HER2/Neu may have an amino acid sequence taken from the ED of HER2/Neu that is given in SEQ ID NO: 1. The sequence segment of the protein antigen of 300 or more contiguous amino acids of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 preferably comprises the amino acid sequence segment from amino acid 332 to 631, more preferably from amino acid 325 to 640, and even more preferably from amino acid 317 to 647, of SEQ ID ΝΟ:1 or variant sequence segments as defined in items (ii) or (iii). As further explained below, the protein antigen does generally not contain further sequence segments having a sequence identity of more than 50% to any sequence segment of the HER2 protein. In another embodiment, the protein antigen has a sequence segment of 300, preferably of 330, more preferably of 337, or more contiguous amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. Also in this embodiment, the protein antigen does generally not contain further sequence segments having a sequence identity of more than 50% to any sequence segment of the HER2 protein. In order for the protein antigen to elicit the desired immune response against HER2, the sequence identity to a sequence portion of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2 does not need to be 100%. Instead, the sequence segment may be a variant having an amino acid sequence having at least 85% sequence identity to a sequence portion from SEQ ID: 1 or SEQ ID: 2. The amino acid sequence identity may be at least 90%, preferably at least 95% and more preferably at least 97%. In calculating percent sequence identity, two sequences are aligned and the number of identical matches of nucleotides or amino acid residues between the two sequences is determined. The number of identical matches is divided by the length of the aligned region (i.e., the number of aligned nucleotides or amino acid residues) and multiplied by 100 to arrive at a percent sequence identity value. Possible and preferred lengths of the sequence segment (aligned region) are as defined above. In another embodiment, the sequence segment may be a variant having an amino acid sequence having at least 91% sequence similarity to a sequence portion from SEQ ID: 1 or SEQ ID: 2. The amino acid sequence identity may be at least 91%, preferably at least 94%, more preferably at least 97% and even more preferably at least 99%. Possible and preferred lengths of the aligned region are as defined above. Amino acid sequence similarities and identities may be determined using BLASTX 2.2.14 using the standard settings. The standard settings allow, for example, for sequence gaps in alignments. Alternatively, the variant sequence segment of the protein antigen may have from 1 to several amino acid additions, substitutions or deletions compared to a sequence portion from SEQ ID: 1 or SEQ ID: 2 over the length of the segment, provided the variant sequence can still elicit formation of antibodies against the ECD of human HER2 protein when injected into an animal (such as a rat or a mouse). The maximum number of amino acid additions, substitutions or deletions may be at most 20, preferably at most 10, more preferably at most 5, whereby the total number of additions, substitutions and additions together determine the number of “amino acid additions, substitutions or deletions”. These numbers of additions, substitutions and additions occur over the length of the sequence segment of 300 or more amino acid residues. Preferred lengths are as those given above. Substitutions may take place at those positions in the amino acid sequence where an aligned rat and human HER2 protein deviate, such as in the alignment shown in Fig. 2. This is based on the fact that antibodies against the ECD of rat HER2 protein are crossreactive with the ECD of the human HER2 protein and vice versa. Preferably, amino acids at one or more of the following positions of SEQ ID ΝΟ:1 may be substituted by residues of other amino acids: 317, 318, 352, 353, 356, 353, 359, 361, 365, 387, 398, 390, 394, 420, 429, 430, 451, 452, 470, 472, 497, 498, 502, 503, 505, 506, 510, 512, 513, 517, 533, 547, 548, 556-559, 572, 574, 579, 585, 593-595, 622, 639, 640, 651. The definitions of the variant sequence segment by way of minimum sequence identity or similarity and by way of the maximum number of additions or deletions may be combined. Thus, the variant sequence segment may have the minimum sequence identities or similarities to SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2 and from 1 to 20, preferably from 1 to 10, more preferably from 1 to 5 additions and/or deletions, allowing for optimized alignment when determining the sequence identity or similarity. Preferably, the variant sequence segment may have the minimum sequence identities to SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2 and from 1 to 10 additions and/or deletions. Alternatively, the variant sequence segment of the protein antigen may be encoded by a nucleic acid that hybridizes under stringent conditions to a nucleic acid that is complementary to a nucleic acid sequence encoding SEQ ID: 1 or SEQ ID: 2. The hybridization conditions depend on the G/C composition of DNA probe and salt concentration in hybridization buffer. For hybridization usually different concentrations of SSC buffer are used. 1xSSC buffer contains 150 mM NaCI, 15 mM trisodium citrate, pH 7.0. The hybridization results are directly related to the hybridization stringency, e.g. number of degrees below the Tm (melting temperature) of DNA at which the experiment is performed. Higher number of degrees below the Tm corresponds weaker hybridization stringency. For a aqueous solution of DNA (no salt) the formula for Tm is: Tm = 69.3°C + 0.41 (% G + C)°C. Herein, stringent conditions are, for example, conditions wherein the hybridization takes place in 1χ SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 60°C. The protein antigen and, preferably, the protein conjugate of the invention preferably do not contain a further amino acid sequence segment as follows: a further amino acid sequence segment of 20 or more, preferably 10 or more, contiguous amino acid residues from a sequence portion from amino acid 1 to 253, preferably 1 to 283, more preferably 1 to 300, nor from a sequence portion starting from amino acid 670, preferably from amino acid 654, to amino acid 1255 of SEQ ID NO: 18; or a further amino acids sequence segment of more than 20 contiguous amino acid residues having more than 50%, preferably more than 40%, sequence identity to a sequence portion from amino acid 1 to 253, preferably 1 to 283, more preferably 1 to 300, nor to a sequence portion starting from amino acid 670, preferably from amino acid 654, to amino acid 1255 of SEQ ID NO: 18. In one embodiment, the protein antigen, and the protein conjugate containing the protein antigen, do not contain an amino acid sequence segment of 10 or more, preferably of 5 or more, contiguous amino acid residues from the transmembrane domain or the intracellular domain of the Her2/neu protein of SEQ ID NO: 18. In another embodiment, any further sequence segment (of the protein antigen) of a length of at least 7 amino acid residues of said protein antigen has an amino acid sequence identity less than 50% to any sequence portion of identical length of SEQ ID NO: 18. In a further embodiment, the protein antigen consists of a first sequence segment that can elicit the immune response against the HER2 protein and optionally a further sequence segment, wherein said first sequence segment (i) has an amino acid sequence of 300, preferably of 330, more preferably of 337 or more contiguous amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2; or (ii) has a variant amino acid sequence of 300, preferably of 330, more preferably of 337 or more amino acid residues, and the amino acid sequence of said variant sequence segment has at least 85% or at least 90% or at least 95% sequence identity to a sequence portion from SEQ ID: 2; or (iii) has a variant amino acid sequence of 300, preferably of 330, more preferably of 337 or more amino acid residues and has from 1 to 20 substitutions, deletions or additions in said variant sequence compared to a sequence segment of 300 or more amino acid residues, or of an amino acid sequence of the same length in terms of number of amino acid residues, of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2; and wherein said protein antigen (or the protein conjugate containing the protein antigen) does not contain a further amino acid sequence segment of 20 or more, preferably 10 or more, contiguous amino acid residues from a sequence portion from amino acid 1 to 253, preferably 1 to 283, nor from a sequence portion starting from amino acid 670, preferably from amino acid 654 of SEQ ID NO: 18. In the protein conjugate containing the protein antigen, the protein antigen and the immunogenic carrier are preferably covalently bonded by chemical cross-linking using a chemical cross-linking agent. The protein antigen may be cloned and expressed according to generally known methods. However, expression is preferably done in eukaryotic cells. A nucleic acid encoding the desired portion or the first segment from the extracellular domain of HER2/Neu may be cloned using primers designed for such portion using the known gene sequence of the HER2 gene. The GenBank accession no. for the Her2/neu gene is: ΑΑΑ75493 (SEQ ID NO: 18). Many different expression systems that are based on different production hosts (bacteria, fungi, animal, insect and plant cells) and expression vectors designed either for stable transgenic or transient expression can be used. All such systems are well known to the skilled person and described (for review see: Huang, C.J., Lin, Η. & Yang, X. 2012, J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol., 39:383-399: Hou, J., Tyo, Κ.Ε., Liu, Ζ. et al., 2012, FEMS Yeast Res., 12:491-510; Martinez, J.L,, Liu, L., Petranovic, D. et al., 2012, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol., Apr 12. [Epub ahead of print]; Su, Χ., Schmitz, G., Zhang, Μ. etal., 2012, Adv Appl Microbiol., 81:1-61; Ghaderi, D., Zhang, Μ., Hurtado-Ziola, N.& Varki, A. 2012, Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev., 28:147-175; Egelkrout, Ε., Rajan, V. & Howard, J.A., 2012, Plant Sci.,184:83-101) and the choice of the system depends on factors such as cost of materials or the speed required for the protein production. Our preferred choice are plant expression systems, notably plant virus-based transient expression system due to speed, yield and universality in production of different types of recombinant proteins including the hetero-oligomeric proteins like monoclonal antibodies. Another important advantage of plant expression systems is the ability to provide for the production of plant viral particles by allowing expression of plant viral coat protein or fusion proteins from the expression vector (Werner, S. et al., 2006, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,103:17678-17683: W02007031339). Such systems are described in detail in numerous research articles, reviews and patents (Marillonnet, S., Thoeringer, C., Kandzia, R. et al., 2005, Nat. Biotechnol., 23:718-723; Giritch, A., Marillonnet, S., Engler, C., et al., 2006, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A, 103:14701-14706; Gleba, Υ., Klimyuk, V. & Marillonnet, S. 2007, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol., 18:134-141; Klimyuk, V., Pogue, G., Herz, S. et al., 2012, Curr Top Microbiol Immunol., Apr 15; W02005049839; W02006079546). W02005049839 contains detailed information of possible plant viral expression vectors, modifications thereof and sequence information thereof. The design of viral vectors, cloning strategy and expression of recombinant proteins and viral particles is described in detail herein in the EXAMPLE 1. Modular cloning strategies for seamless stitching together different DNA fragments was established in our laboratory (Engler, C., Kandzia, R. & Marillonnet, S., 2008, PLoS One, 3:℮3647; Weber Ε., Engler, C., Guetzner, R. etal., 2011, PLoS One, _6:e16765; Engler, C. & Marillonnet, S. 2011, Methods Mol Biol.,729:167-81; Thieme, F., Engler, C., Kandzia, R. et at., 2011, PLoS One, 6:℮20556) and used for construct engineering. The system is simple, reliable, convenient to use and allows fast construct engineering of any complexity. The ED44 of human Her2/neu (amino acid residues 310 - 653; Fig 1Α) and its two truncated variants (amino acid residues 310-649 and 340-649; Fig 1C, D) have been cloned into viral vectors, tested for the expression level and were used for conjugate generation and vaccine formulation. After expression of the protein antigen preferably in a eukaryotic host, it is purified using generally known methods. In one embodiment, the protein antigen has a purification tag. Purification can then involve column chromatography using a matrix having affinity to the purification tag. The immunogenic carrier may have a molecular weight of at least 5 kDa, preferably of at least 10 kDa, more preferably at least 15 kDa, and even more preferably of at least 20 kDa. The molecular weight may, however, still be much larger than 20 kDa and may be higher than 100 kDa. The carrier may or may not be a protein. Preferably, however, the carrier is also a protein. The carrier protein may be a monomeric protein such as tetanus toxin fragment C or the DOM1 fragment (SEQ ID NO: 17) thereof or a multimeric protein. Multimeric proteins may be di-, tri or higher oligomers or even polymers of protein subunits. An example of a widely used carrier that is a polymeric protein is Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanine (KLH) (Harris, J.R. & Markl, J. 1999, Micron., 30: 597-623; Harris, J.R. & Markl, J. 2000, Eur. Urol., 3: 24-33). Examples of other polymeric proteins are viral particles that may consist of or comprise a large number of monomeric protein molecules or subunits, generally multimers of coat protein monomers. Such viral particles may contain viral RNA or DNA. Viral particles are preferred carriers, since they are highly immunogenic, notably in mammals such as humans, and can cause a strong immune response. In one embodiment, the viral particles are plant viral particles, such as of plant tobamoviruses. Viral particles, notably plant viral particles, that may be used as immunogenic carriers in the protein conjugate of the invention are described in more detail in the following. A viral particle is a multimeric particle comprising a plurality of viral coat protein molecules. The sizes of the viral particles as determined in electron microscopy as described in Analytical Biochem., 333 (2004) 230-235 may be at least 10 nm in the shortest dimension, more preferably at least 13 nm in the shortest dimension. As mentioned before, viral particles are generally formed of many coat protein molecules. The viral particles, notably the plant viral particles, can be formed by expressing the coat protein molecules in a suitable host such as in a plant or cells thereof as desribed in WO 2007/ 031339 or by purifying plant viral particles from a plant host that is infected with the plant virus. Plant viruses, the plant viral particles of which may be used in the protein conjugate of the present invention, are known, see e.g. the book of Drews, Adam, Heinze, “Molekulare Pflanzenvirologie”, Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg 2004. The viral particles may be produced by expressing a polynucleotide encoding the (monomeric) protein, generally the coat protein, that assembles for forming the viral particle in a bacterial or plant host. The plant host may be plant cells, plant tissue or entire plants. Apart from encoding the coat protein, said polynucleotide will have regulatory elements required for the expression of the coat protein in the chosen host. Upon expressing the polynucleotide, the viral particles of the invention generally assemble within host cells or may be assembled in vitro after isolating the coat protein from the host cells under suitable conditions. The plant viral coat protein may be derived from any plant virus such as the plant viruses listed below. In one embodiment, said plant viral coat protein is derived from a plant virus forming rod-shaped viral particles. Other examples are filamentous and icosahedral plant viral particles. “Being derived” means that the coat protein that forms the plant viral particle does not have to be identical to the natural coat protein of a plant virus. Instead, the coat protein used may have additions, deletions, insertions or mutations relative to a natural coat protein of a plant virus. In one embodiment, at most 20 amino acid residues of the natural plant viral coat protein are deleted and/or mutated. In another embodiment, at most 20 amino acid residues are inserted into the natural sequence of the plant viral coat protein of the plant virus from which the coat protein is derived. The plant viral particle (and the plant viral coat protein that forms the plant viral particle) and the plant viral particle may be derived from an RNA virus, such as a plant plus-sense single-stranded RNA virus, or from a DNA virus. Examples of plant viruses the coat protein of which may be used for the present invention include tobamoviruses such as tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), turnip vein clearing virus (TVCV), potato virus X, potato virus Υ and fragments or homologues thereof, provided said fragments or homologues are capable of forming viral particles. In one embodiment, the coat protein used has a sequence identity of at least 50% to the coat protein of turnip vein clearing virus, to tobacco mosaic virus, potato virus X or potato virus Υ. In another embodiment, said sequence identity is at least 60%; in a further embodiment, said sequence identity is at least 70%. In an important embodiment, the coat protein has a sequence identity to the coat protein of tobacco mosaic virus of at least 90%. Plant viruses belonging to different taxonomic groups that form viral particles can be used as immunogenic carriers according to the principles of the present invention.

Rod-shaped viruses - TMV: the virions have ≈300 nm in length and ≈18 nm in diameter; PVX (filamentous; usually flexuous; with a clear modal length): 515 nm long and 13 nm in diameter; Brome Mosaic Virus: 26 nm in diameter. Symmetry/shape - icosahedral: Alfalfa mosaic virus (Nucleocapsids bacilliform, or quasiisometric elongated): 35 nm long (Tb) or 30 nm long; Ta that occurs either in bacilliform (Ta-b) or ellipsoidal (Ta-t) shape) with no clear modal length: 56 nm long (Β); 43 nm long (Μ); 18 nm in diameter. Preferred plant viral particles are from plant viruses having a single-stranded plussense RNA genome. The viruses (tobacco mosaic virus and potato virus X) may be expressed using well-established expression systems for said viruses (Donson et al., 1991, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 88\7204-7208; Shivprasad et al., 1999, Virology, 255:312-323: Marillonnet et al., 2004, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA,101:6852-6857; Marillonnet et al., 2005, Nat Biotechnol., 23:718-723; Chapman, Kavanagh & Baulcombe, 1992, Plant J., 2j549-557; Baulcombe, Chapman & Santa Cruz, 1995, Plant J., 7:1045-1053; Angell & Baulcombe, 1997, ΕΜΒΟ J., 16:3675-3684) including the very recently developed system for expression of hetero-oligomeric proteins (ΕΡ Application No. 05 001 819.1; WO 2006/079546). Plant viral particles from other viruses including DNA viruses also can be used for practicing this invention (for reviews please refer to: Mullineaux et al., 1992, Genetic Engineering in Plant Viruses, CRC Press Inc., ρρ187-215; Timmermans et al., 1994, Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol., 45:79-112; Porta & Lomonossoff, 2002, Biotechnol. Genet. Engineering Rev., 19:245-291). Thus, the immunogenic carrier may be a plant viral particle that may be derived from an RNA virus, such as a Tobamovirus. In another embodiment, the immunogenic carrir is a plant viral particle of a virus from the family Potyviridae. Other options were mentioned above. Multimeric carrier proteins may be covalently bonded to multiple protein antigen molecules, e.g. as illustrated in Fig. 3C. Notably, a viral particle as a carrier may be covalently bonded to multiple molecules of the protein antigen. The best known examples of non-proteinaceous carriers are liposomes (for review see: Felnerova, D., Viret, J.F., GlOck, R., et al., 2004, Curr Opin Biotechnol., 15: 518-29; Tiwari, S., Agrawal, G.P. & Vyas, S.P. 2010, Nanomedicine, 5: 1617-1650). Carrier proteins may be expressed as generally known in the art, e.g using expression systems such as those mentioned above. Expression of plant viral coat protein and production of plant viral particles is described in detail in W02007031339. Other carriers are commercially available such as Tetanus toxin fragment C from Sigma-Aldrich (Τ3694 Sigma) or from Merck-Millipore (No. 582235). As a further alternative, a part of Tetanus toxin fragment C called DOM1 (see SEQ ID NO: 17) can be used. It was shown that, unlike Tetanus fragment C, DOM1 is a novel antigen for Β cells in patients and hence would not be recognised by pre-existing antibodies induced because of a tetanus vaccination (Low, L., Manderr, A., McCann, Κ. et al., 2009, Human Gene Then, 20:1269-1278), that supposedly might slow down the immune response. In one embodiment of the invention where the carrier is a protein carrier, the protein conjugate comprising the protein antigen and the carrier protein may be expressed as a fusion protein, i.e. as portions of one amino acid sequence. In such embodiment, the covalent bond between the protein antigen and the carrier protein is a peptide bond of the fusion protein. A linker peptide may be used in between the protein antigen and the carrier protein for allowing independent folding of the protein antigen domain and the carrier protein domain of the fusion protein. W02007031339 describes how protein antigen as a recombinant protein co-expressed as a fusion protein with plant viral coat protein. Coat protein domains may then assemble, optionally in the presence of free viral coat protein, to form plant viral particles displaying on their surface protein antigen domains. The immunogenic carrier protein preferably does not have similarity to the HER2 protein. Thus, the carrier protein does preferably not have an amino acid sequence segment of 50 or more, preferably of 30 or more, more preferably of 20 or more, and even more preferably of 10 or more contiguous amino acid residues, which sequence segment has an amino acid sequence identity of more than 50% to any sequence portion of identical length (in terms of number of amino acid residues) of SEQ ID NO: 18. Conjugation of the protein antigen and the carrier by one or more covalent bonds is described next. Covalent linking of two or more different proteins or peptides can be achieved using several well-known approaches. These are not limited to: translational fusion; intein-mediated cis- or trans-splicing, hetero-oligomeric proteins assembly via disulfide bonds formation, chemical conjugation using cross-linking agents. One of the most commonly used approaches is translational (in-frame) fusion of proteins of interest or fragments thereof, where they are expressed from one transcriptional unit under control of single promoter. Generation of translational fusions between different proteins or parts thereof is well-known prior art and can be carried out using standard molecular biology techniques (Sambroock, J., Fritsch, E.F., Maniatis, Τ. 1989, Molecular cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York). The approach is frequently used for improving expression and facilitating purification of recombinant proteins (Butt, T.R., Edavettal, S.C., Hall, J.P. et at, 2005, Protein Expr. Purif., 43:1-9; Fazen, C.H., Kahkoska, A..R, Doyle, R.P., 2012, Protein Expr. Purif., 85:51-59; for review see: Lichty, J.J., Malecki, J.L., Agnew, H.D., et al., 2011, Protein Expr. Purif., Sep 3. [Epub ahead of print]), determining tissue-, cell- or subcellular compartmentalization of the proteins of interest or studying their interactions (e.g. GFP or GUS reporter gene fusions- Sepulveda-Garcia, Ε. & Rocha-Sosa, Μ. 2012, Plant Sci.,195:36-47; Ahn, C.S., Han, J.A. & Pai, H.S. 2012, Planta, Sept 22, [Epub ahead of print]) or for any other applications like fusing heterologous domains for making chimaeric proteins (Meng, Z.F., Wang, H.J., Yao, X. et al., 2012, Chin. Med. J.,125:3266-3272; Eon-Duval, A., Valax, Ρ., Solacroup, Τ. et al., 2012, J Pharm Sci., 101:3604-3618). Covalent in-frame fusion of two or more different proteins or protein fragments can be achieved by using intein-mediated trans-splicing. Inteins were first identified as protein sequences embedded in-frame within protein precursor and excised during protein maturation process (Perler, F.B., Davis, Ε.Ο., Dean, G.E. et al., 1994, Nucleic Acids Res., 22:1125-1127 ; Perler, F. Β. , 1998, Cell, 92;1-4). All information and catalytic groups necessary to perform a self-splicing reaction reside in the intein and two flanking amino acids. The chemical mechanism of protein splicing is described in detail by Perler and colleagues (1997, Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., Τ292-299) and by Shao & Kent (1997, Chem. Biol., 4:187-194). Inteins usually consist of N-and C-terminal splicing regions and central homing endonuclease region or small linker region. Over 100 inteins are known so far that are distributed among the nuclear and organellar genomes of different organisms including eukaryotes,' archaebacteria and eubacteria (http://www. neb. com/neb/inteins. html). Engineering of split inteins is described for example in Brenzel, S., Kurpiers, Τ. & Mootz, H.D. 2006, Biochemistry, 45:1571-1578). Finding of new natural split inteins is described in Carvajal-Vallejos, Ρ., Pallisse, R., Mootz, H.D. et at, 2012, J. Biol. Chem.,287:28686-96. It was shown that intein molecules are capable of trans-splicing. The removal of the central homing endonuclease region does not have any effect on intein self-splicing. This also made possible the design of trans-splicing systems, in which the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of intein are co-expressed as separate fragments and, when fused to exteins (protein fragments, being ligated together with the help of intein), can perform trans-splicing in vivo (Shingledecker, Κ., Jiang, S.Q. & Paulus, Η., 1998, Gene,207:187-195). It was also demonstrated with N-and C-terminal segments of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis RecA intein, that protein trans-splicing could take place in vitro (Mills, K.V., Lew, Β.Μ., Jiang, S., et a!., 1998, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 95:3543-3548). This phenomenon was also identified for DnaE protein of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 (Wu, Η., Hu, Ζ. & Liu, X.Q., 1998, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 95:9226-9231). Two different genes located more than 700 Kb. ρ. apart on opposite DNA strands encode this protein. It was also shown that two intein sequences encoded by those genes reconstitute a split mini-intein and are able to mediate protein trans- splicing activity when tested in Esherichia coli cells. The intein molecule of the same origin (DnaE intein from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803) was used to produce functional herbicide-resistant acetolactate synthase 11 from two unlined fragments (Sun, L., Ghosh, I., Paulus, Η. et at., 2001, Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 67:1025-29) and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) (Chen, L., Pradhan, S. & Evans, T.C., 2001, Gene,263:39-48) in Ε coli. Yet another way of linking two or more polypeptides together is their assembly via disulfide bond formation. The easiest way to achieve this is to use fragments of proteins that are known to interact between each other and, preferably, to form disulfide bonds. Examples of such fragments are the constant regions of immunoglobulin light (e.g. “kappa” or “lambda”) and heavy (e.g. Fc of IgG) chains. This approach can be used for formation of homodimers consisting of antigen fusion to constant regions heavy chain (US7067110) and for bi-specific IgG design ( Zuo,Z., Jimenez, Χ., Witte, L. & Zhu, Ζ. 2000, Protein Eng., 13:361-367: Davis, J.H., Aperlo, C., Li, Υ. et at., 2010, Protein Eng. Des. Sel., 23:195-202: for review see Carter, Ρ. 2001, J. Immunol. Methods,248:7-150: Thakur, A., Lum, L.G. 2010, Curr.Opin. Mol. Ther., 12:340-3490). The most universal approach for covalently linking two or more different proteins is to use chemical cross-linking agents, which is preferred for linking the protein antigen and the carrier protein in the present invention. Various known cross-linking agents can be applied for this purpose. Frequently employed cross-linking agents are glutaraldehyde (Maloney, D.G., Kaminski, M.S., Burowski, D. et. al., 1985, Hybridoma, 4:192-209; Timmerman, J.M. & Levy, R., 2000, J. Immunol.,164:4797-47803: Bendandi, Μ., Gocke, C.D., Kobrin, C.B. et. al., 1999, Nat. Med., 5:1171-1177; Bendandi, Μ., Marillonnet, S., Kandzia, R. et. al., 2010, Ann. Oncol., 21:2420-2427), maleimide (Betting, D.J., Kafi, Κ., Abdollah-Fard, A. et al., 2008, J. Immunol.,181:4131-4140; Kafi, Κ., Betting, D.J., Yamada, R.E. et. al., 2009, Mol. Immunol., 46:448-4560) and many others. Glutaraldehyde crosslinks proteins primarily via lysine residues, with secondary reactions at cysteine, tyrosine, and histidine residues (Migneault, 1., Dartiguenave, C., Bertrand, M.J. & Waldron, K.C., 2004, Biotechniques, 37:790-796). Maleimide acts on (reduced) cysteine sulfhydryl groups (Betting, D.J., Kafi, Κ., Abdollah-Fard, A. et al., 2008, J. Immunol.,181:4131-4140). Techniques of cross-linking as well as numerous cross-linking agents are well-known to those familiar with the art and are described in many reviews and protocols (Wong, S.S. & Wong, L.J. 1993, Enzyme Microb. Technol., 14:866-874: Wong, S.S. & Jameson, D.M. 2009, Chemistry of Protein and Nucleic Acid Cross-Linking and Conjugation, CRC Press, Second Edition; Thermo Scientific Pierce Crosslinking Technical Handbook, 2009, Thermo Scientific; for downloading more info or protocols - www.thermo.com/pierce). Cross-linking agents are also commercially available and the protocols for cross-linking proteins of the manufacturer may be followed. Thus, in such embodiment, the protein conjugate may be produced by a process comprising providing the protein antigen and the immunogenic carrier as separate protein molecules and cross-linking the protein antigen and the immunogenic carrier via a linker using a chemical cross-linking agent such as glutaraldehyde. The kit of the invention comprises the protein antigen as defined herein and an immunogenic protein or protein aggregate for cross-linking with said protein antigen for forming the protein conjugate. The kit may further contain a chemical cross-linking agent. The protein conjugate obtained as described above is generally stored in an aqueous medium. For longer storage times, it may be frozen or lyophilized. The aqueous medium may contain a buffer to control the pH and may contain physiologic saline and/or other additives. The anti-cancer vaccine of the invention contains the protein conjugate of the invention and suitable pharmacologically acceptable excipients. In another embodiment, the anti-cancer vaccine contains the protein antigen, whereby the protein antigen may not be covalently linked to an immunogenic carrier or an immunogenic carrier protein, and suitable pharmacologically acceptable excipients. The invention also provides a vaccine comprising a protein antigen as described herein, wherein the protein antigen of item (ii) or item (iii) is capable of providing protection against a HER-2/Neu-positive cancer, in particular therapeutic protection after tumor formation as determined in the Balb-NeuT metastatic breast cancer model. As the anti-cancer vaccine is generally administered to patients by injection, the anti-cancer vaccine is generally a liquid aqueous formulation. However, the anti-cancer vaccine may also be in solid form such as in a lyophilized form to be reconstituted with an aqueous medium before administration. Examples for excipients include, without limitation, sterile aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Aqueous excipients include, without limitation, water, alcohol, saline, and buffered solutions. Preservatives and other additives such as, for example, antimicrobials, anti-oxidants, chelating agents may also be present. Similarly as described in US 8,222,214, the anti-cancer vaccine can comprise agents that enhance the protective efficacy of the vaccine, such as adjuvants. Adjuvants include any compound or compounds that act to increase a protective immune response to the protein conjugate, thereby reducing the quantity of antigen necessary in the vaccine, and/or the frequency of administration necessary to generate a protective immune response. Adjuvants can include for example, emulsifiers, muramyl dipeptides, pyridine, aqueous adjuvants such as aluminum hydroxide, aluminum salts, chitosan-based adjuvants, and any of the various saponins, oils, and other substances known in the art, such as Amphigen, LPS, bacterial cell wall extracts, bacterial DNA, CpG sequences, synthetic oligonucleotides and combinations thereof (Schijns et al. (2000) Curr. Opin. Immunol. 12:456), Mycobacterial phlei (Μ. phlei) cell wall extract (MCWE) (U.S. Pat. No. 4,744,984), Μ. phlei DNA (M-DNA), and M-DNA-M. phlei cell wall complex (MCC). Compounds which can serve as emulsifiers include natural and synthetic emulsifying agents, as well as anionic, cationic and nonionic compounds. Among the synthetic compounds, anionic emulsifying agents include, for example, the potassium, sodium and ammonium salts of lauric and oleic acid, the calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts of fatty acids, and organic sulfonates such as sodium lauryl sulfate. Synthetic cationic agents include, for example, cetyltrhethylammonlum bromide, while synthetic nonionic agents are exemplified by glycerylesters (e.g., glyceryl monostearate), polyoxyethylene glycol esters and ethers, and the sorbitan fatty acid esters (e.g., sorbitan monopalmitate) and their polyoxyethylene derivatives (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate). Natural emulsifying agents include acacia, gelatin, lecithin and cholesterol. Other suitable adjuvants can be formed with an oil component, such as a single oil, a mixture of oils, a water-in-oil emulsion, or an oil-in-water emulsion. The oil can, be a mineral oil, a vegetable oil, or an animal oil. Mineral oils are liquid hydrocarbons obtained from petrolatum via a distillation technique, and are also referred to in the art as liquid paraffin, liquid petrolatum, or white mineral oil. Suitable animal oils include, for example, cod liver oil, halibut oil, menhaden oil, orange roughy oil and shark liver oil, all of which are available commercially. Suitable vegetable oils, include, for example, canola oil, almond oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, olive oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, or soybean oil. Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) and Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant (FIA) are two common adjuvants that are commonly used in vaccine preparations, and are also suitable for use in the present invention. Both FCA and FIA are water-in-mineral oil emulsions; however, FCA also contains a killed Mycobacterium sp. Immunomodulatory cytokines can also be used in the vaccine compositions to enhance vaccine efficacy, for example, as an adjuvant. Non-limiting examples of such cytokines include interferon alpha (IFN-a), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or combinations thereof. GM-CSF is preferred as a cytokine. The anti-cancer vaccine of the invention can be used for treating or preventing HER-2/Neu-positive cancer in mammals, preferably in humans. Treating HER-2/Neu-positive cancer is preferred over prevention thereof. Treatment means that the vaccine is administered to a subject having the cancer. Preferred anti-cancer vaccines of the invention have a therapeutic effect, which means that further development of a HER-2/Neupositive cancer can be prevented or slowed down even if the vaccine is administered when the cancer has already formed in the patient. In the examples, therapy is investigated and demonstrated in experiments referred to as “therapeutic setting”. Many different types of cancers can be HER-2/Neu-positive, such as breast, liver, kidney, pancreatic, ovarian, prostate, gastric, colon, colorectal, bladder, testicular, stomach, esophageal or thyroid cancer. Detection of the HER2 gene or protein in these cancers may be e.g. by an immune reaction in biopsies using anti-HER-2/Neu monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies or by determining expressed RNA from the HER2 gene. Amplification of the HER2 gene was tested in Science 235 (1987) 177-182 and correlated with the prognosis of breast cancer. When treating a HER-2/Neu-positive cancer in a patient suffering from such cancer, the anti-cancer vaccine is administered to the patient. Administration of the vaccine can be by infusion or injection (e.g., intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, subcutaneously, intrathecal, intraduodenally, intraperitoneally, and the like). Preferably, the compositions or vaccines are administered by intradermal injection. The anti-cancer vaccine is administered to a patient in a therapeutically effective amount. The amount depends on the several variables such as the size or weight of the patient and condition of the patient. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the vaccine can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in patients. The dosage of such vaccine compositions lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The vaccine can be administered to a patient on any schedule appropriate to induce and/or sustain protective immunity against the cancer, and more specifically to induce and/or sustain a humoral and preferably a cytotoxic Τ lymphocyte response to the protein antigen. For example, patients can be administered a vaccine composition as a primary immunization as described and exemplified herein, followed by administration of a booster to bolster and/or maintain the protective immunity. In some aspects, patients can be administered the vaccine compositions 1,2 or more times per month. Once per month for six consecutive months is preferred to establish the protective immune response, particularly with respect to the primary immunization schedule. In some aspects, boosters can be administered at regular intervals such as every 6 or more months after completion of the primary immunization schedule. Administration of the booster may be every 6 months. The vaccine administration schedule, including primary immunization and booster administration, can continue as long as needed for the patient, for example, over the course of several years, to over the lifetime of the patient. In some aspects, the vaccine schedule includes more frequent administration at the beginning of the vaccine regimen, and includes less frequent administration (e.g., boosters) over time to maintain the protective immunity. The vaccine of the invention may be administered to a human patient in a dosage of from 0.1 mg to 50 mg of the sequence segment of 300 or more contiguous amino acids from the ECD of the HER2 protein or of the variant sequence segment of the protein antigen per administration. Such dosage may also be used in subsequent administrations. EXAMPLES In the following, the invention is further illustrated using examples. The invention is, however, not limited to these examples. EXAMPLE 1 Construct design The Her2-ED44 sequence of rat (GenBank accession no.: NP_058699, amino acid residues 314-657 = 344 residues, Fig. 1-2) was generated using PCR from the respective cDNA by adding flanking Bsal sites and removing two internal Bsa\ sites. The human HER2-ED44 sequence (GenBank accession no.: ΑΑΑ75493, amino acid residues 310-653 = 344 residues, Fig. 1-2) was generated using gene synthesis with the codon usage of Nicotiana tabacum. From the rat and human Her2-ED44, different versions (modules) were generated using PCR. These modules differ in the overhangs created by the flanking Bsa\ restriction sites which will be used for cloning (Fig. 4-9). Fragment C serves as immunogenic carrier protein in the vaccine which aids to break the self-tolerance for HER2. Tetanus toxin is a potent neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani the causative agent of tetanus. Fragment C is a non-toxic C-terminal portion of the Tetanus toxin which confers binding to neurons (Swiss-Prot accession no.: Ρ04958, amino acid residues 865-1315 = 451 residues). The Tetanus toxin fragment C sequence was generated by gene synthesis. Also here, from the originally synthesized fragment C sequence different modules were generated using PCR (Fig. 10-11). The Her2-ED44 and Tetanus toxin fragment C modules were cloned in TMV-based viral expression vectors (magnICON® system, see below) using the Type IIS restriction enzyme Ssal which generates different, customized overhangs for each module and thereby allowing assembly of the final construct by removing these restriction sites (Engler, C., Kandzia, R. & Marillonnet, S. 2008, PLoS One, 3:℮3647; Fig. 4, Fig. 7, Fig. 10). The TMV-based viral vector constructs also contained a rice a-amylase 3Α signal peptide (Swiss-Prot accession no.: Ρ27932) which is cleaved off in planta and serves to deliver the protein of interest in the plant apoplast where it accumulates. The rice a-amylase signal peptide was amplified from Oryza sativa genomic DNA and the last two amino acids of the signal peptide modified from HA to SG (wild type: MGKQMAALCGFLLVALLWLTPDVAHA; modified: MGKQMAALCGFLLVALLWLTPDVASG) due to cloning reasons. Additionally, Her2-ED44 and Tetanus toxin fragment C were fused to a (GGGGS)3 linker and a 6χ His tag or human kappa light chain constant region (Swiss-Prot accession no.: Ρ01834) which was optimized by gene synthesis for Ν. tabacum codon usage (Fig. 4-11). As an alternative immunogenic carrier, Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) particles were used. TMV particles have a rod-like structure of approximately 300 nm in length and 18 nm in diameter. The particles are built of coat protein (CP) subunits which assemble around the genomic, single-stranded RNA of the virus. To improve the conjugation efficiency by glutardialdehyde, the coat protein was modified. The N-terminal modification of the TVCV coat protein (Swiss-Prot accession no.: Q88922), i.e. addition of 4 amino acid residues ADFK, was introduced in the wild-type sequence by PCR (primer sequence: τττ ggtctc A AATG GCT GAC ΤΤΤ AAG AGC TAT AAC ATC ACG ΑΑΤ CCT AAC C; 5sal restriction site, generated overhang, introduced additional codons). The resulting DNA module encoding the CPLys protein was also cloned into a magnICON® TMV-based viral expression vector using the type IIS enzyme Bsa\ (Fig. 12). Viral binary expression vectors were developed based on the magnICON® technology (Gleba, Υ., Klimyuk, V. & Marillonnet, S., 2005, Vaccine, 2005, 23:2042-2048: Gleba, Υ., Klimyuk, V. & Marillonnet, S. 2007, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol., 18:134-141) using elements from Tobamo viruses (Tobacco Mosaic Virus, TMV), i.e. from the cDNAs of two closely related plant viruses, TVCV (turnip vein clearing virus; Lartey, R.T., Lane, L.C. & Melcher, U. 1994, Arch. Virol., 138:287-298; Lartey, R.T., Voss, T.C. & Melcher, U. 1995, Gene, 166:331-332) and crTMV (crucifer-infecting tobamovirus; Dorokhov, Y.L., Ivanov, Ρ.Α., Novikov, V.K., etal., 1994, FEBS Lett.,350:5-8). The resulting vectors are called 'TMV-based', since both parental viruses are tobamoviruses and related to the well-known tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). All three viruses (TVCV, crTMV and TMV) are positive-strand RNA viruses and have the same overall structure and mode of replication. Basically, the viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), the Movement Protein (ΜΡ) and the Coat Protein (CP). The RdRP replicates the full viral RNA transcript (genomic RNA) as well as the two subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) that are required for expression of the two other viral proteins, ΜΡ and CP. The ΜΡ is required for short distance cell-to-cell movement of the viral genomic RNA within the infiltrated leaf. The CP is required for formation of viral particles and long distance systemic movement from leaf to leaf via the vascular system. Formation of viral particles is not required for cell-to-cell movement. Therefore, the CP was eliminated from the viral vectors and replaced with the gene of interest. Thus, the viral vector is unable to produce viral particles and the gene of interest is expressed at higher levels. In addition to the viral proteins and the gene of interest, the viral vector must also contain the 5' and 3' non-translated (5’ ntr and 3’ ntr) viral sequences which are essential for replication (Marillonnet, S., Giritch, A., Gils, Μ. etal., 2004, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 101:6852-7: Fig. 13). For efficient expression of the TMV-based viral vector in plant cells, the cDNA of the viral vector has been cloned between a plant promoter and a plant terminator (Act2 and nos) (Marillonnet, S., Giritch, A., Gils, Μ. et at., 2004, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A.,101:6852-6857) and plant introns were added within the RdRP and ΜΡ sequences (Marillonnet, S., Thoeringer, C., Kandzia, R. etal., 2005, Nat. Biotechnol., 23:718-723). For efficient delivery of TMV-based viral vectors to plant cells, we use Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Therefore, the complete viral vector (plant promoter, TMV-based viral vector sequences with gene of interest, plant terminator) has been cloned between the T-DNA left and right borders of a binary vector. The elements of the binary vector are a pVS1 origin (Hajdukiewicz, Ρ., Svab, Ζ. & Maliga, Ρ., 1994, Plant Mol Biol., 25:989-994) for plasmid replication in Agrobacterium, a co/E1origin for plasmid replication in Ε. coli, a npt\\\ kanamycin antibiotic resistance gene (Frisch, D.A., Harris-Haller, L.W., Yokubaitis, Ν.Τ. et at., 1995, Plant Mol. Biol., 27:405-409) and T-DNA left and right borders (Frisch, D.A., Harris-Haller, L.W., Yokubaitis, Ν.Τ. et al., 1995, Plant Mol. Biol., 27:405-409) to delimitate the ends the DNA transferred to plant cells. To facilitate blue/white selection a lacZa cassette amplified from pUC19 was inserted between two Ssal restriction sites which allow seamless in frame cloning of the gene of interest. Therefore, during initial construction of the viral vectors, all naturally occurring Ssal recognition sites were removed to allow easy and robust cloning of the gene of interest (Fig. 13).

Tetanus-Toxin-Fraqment -C-hKappa and TMV particles in Ν. benthamiana plants (maanlCON® system) For production of the recombinant proteins, the selected Agrobacterium strain harboring the TMV-based expression vector is grown in liquid LBS medium with soya peptone (Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem, The Netherlands) replacing tryptone, and supplemented with 50 pg/mL rifampicin and 50 pg/mL kanamycin. Agrobacterial cultures are grown at 28°C until OD60o reaches 2 to 4. Infiltration solution is prepared by diluting the agrobacterial culture in infiltration buffer (10 mM MES, pH 5.5, 10 mM MgS04) to a defined cell concentration (equivalent to a 200-fold dilution of a culture with OD60o of 1.0). About 40 to 80 Nicotiana benthamiana plants (5 to 10 for harvest of TMV particles), grown under controlled and standardized conditions for 6-8 weeks, are vacuum-infiltrated with the agrobacterial infiltration solution and then kept in the greenhouse for 7-12 days for expression and accumulation of the recombinant protein. Plant leaves are then harvested, ground in liquid nitrogen to a fine leaf powder and kept at -80°C until protein extraction followed by purification. Purification of Her2-ED44-His-taq using Ni-NTI affinity chromatography The leaf powder (0.6 to 1 kg) is extracted in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.5 Μ NaCI, 10 mM imidazole with approximately two volumes (w/v) of extraction buffer. The extraction is performed at +4°C by shaking for 40 minutes. The homogenate is clarified by centrifugation at 15.000 χ g for 10 minutes followed by filtration through MiraCloth filter. The pelleted plant tissue is re-extracted using the same extraction conditions. The extracts are combined and subjected to pH adjustment. The pH of the clarified homogenate is lowered to 5.0 using 5Ν HCL for removal of host cell proteins including Rubisco. After incubation at pH 5 with stirring for about 30 minutes, the pH of the crude extract is re-adjusted to pH 7.4 with 5Ν NaOH. The crude extract is then centrifuged (20.000 χ g for 15 minutes) to remove cell debris and precipitates. Before applying the crude extract to the affinity chromatography column, the crude extract is filtered through several filtration membranes (20pm - 8pm - 3pm - 0.45pm). The clear filtrate is applied onto a 5 mm HisTrap™FF column (GE Healthcare, 17-5255-01), which was equilibrated with 20 CV washing buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, 0.5 Μ NaCI, 20 mM imidazole). After loading, the column is washed with 20 CV of washing buffer. Her2-ED44-His is eluted with 20 CV elution buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, 0.5 Μ NaCL, 0.5 Μ imidazole). A polishing step is applied to remove DNA, host cell proteins and endotoxins. The eluted Her2-ED44-His solution is subjected to a SartobindQ®SingleSep mini capsule (Sartorius, #92IEXQ42D4-SS), which is a strong basic anion exchanger. The SartobindQ®SingleSep mini capsule is sanitized with 1 Ν NaOH followed by equilibration with PBS pH 5.0. Before loading the Her2-ED44-His eluate onto SartobindQ®SingleSep mini capsule, the pH of Her2-ED44-His eluate is adjusted to ρΗ5.0 using 5 Ν HCL. The flow-through of SartobindQ®SingleSep mini capsule is collected and the capsule is washed with PBS buffer, pH 5.0, until base line UV280 nm is reached. The purified Her2-ED44-His is concentrated using Spin-X UF concentrator 30k MWCO (Corning, #431489). Finally, the concentrate is sterile-filtrated using 0.2 pm filter. The protein concentration of purified Her2-ED44-His is determined using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, #23225). Immunoblotting analysis of His-tagged Her2-ED44 was carried out using a primary anti-tetra-His antibody (QIAGEN, #34670) and secondary anti-mouse-IgG-horse radish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma Aldrich, Α4416). Endotoxin determination was carried out using the Endosafe®-PTS system (Charles River Laboratories, #PTS100) with Endosafe®PTS cartridges, sensitivity 10-0.1EU/ml (Charles River Laboratories, #PTS201). Purification Her2-ED44-Kappa and Tetanus Toxin Fragment C-Kappa using affinity chromatography on KappaSelect For protein extraction, the frozen leaf powder (appr. 600 g to 1 kg) is mixed with approximately two volumes (w/v) of extraction buffer (200 mM sodium citrate, ρΗ6, 5 mM EDTA) and incubated with shaking for about 40 minutes. The homogenate is clarified by centrifugation at 15.000 χ g for 10 minutes followed by filtration through MiraCloth filter. The extraction was repeated to ensure the maximal yield of expressed recombinant protein. The pH of the clarified homogenate is then lowered to pH 5.0 using sodium citrate solution for removal of host cell proteins including Rubisco. After incubation at ρΗ5 for about 30 minutes, the pH of the crude extract is re-adjusted with 5 Ν NaOH to pH 7.4. The extract is centrifuged at 20.000 χ gfor 15 minutes to remove precipitates and cell debris and subsequently filtered through several membrane filters (20pm - 8pm - 3pm and 0.45pm) to obtain an extract suitable for subsequent column chromatography. All chromatography steps are carried out at room temperature using a GE Healthcare ΑΚΤΑ Purifier Chromatography System. Affinity chromatography with KappaSelect (GE Healthcare, 17-5458-01) is performed to purify recombinant fusion proteins containing a Kappa constant region as purification tag. The column material is equilibrated with 20 column (CV) volumes PBS ρΗ7.34 prior loading the filtered protein extract. After loading, the column is washed with 20 CV wash buffer PBS, ρΗ7.34. Column-bound protein is eluted with a low pH buffer (0.1 Μ Glycine ρΗ2.9) via a peak-based fractionation and adjusted to a neutral pH with 0.4 Μ Na2HP04. After KappaSelect affinity chromatography, the eluate is further purified (polishing step) on a SartobindQ®SingleSep mini capsule, a strong basic anion exchanger (Sartorius, #92IEXQ42D4-SS). The SartoBinQ column was sanitized with 1 Ν NaOH, followed by equilibration with PBS ρΗ5.0 before use. The pH of eluate was adjusted to 4.8 before loading into SartoBindQ column. The flow-though was collected and column was washed with PBS buffer (ρΗ5.0) until base line UV280 nm is reached. The purified Her2-ED44-Kappa was concentrated using Spin-X UF concentrator 30k MWCO (Corning, #431489) and purified Tetanus Toxin Fragment C-Kappa was concentrated using Spin-X UF concentrator 50k MWCO (Corning, #431490). The concentrate was then sterile-filtrated using 0.2 pm filter. The concentration of purified protein is determined using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, #23225). Endotoxin determination was carried out using the Endosafe®-PTS system (Charles River Laboratories, #PTS100) with Endosafe®PTS cartridges, sensitivity 10-0.1EU/ml (Charles River Laboratories, #PTS201). Purification of TMV virus particles The frozen leaf powder is mixed with 3-5 volumes (w/v) of 0.1 Μ potassium phosphate buffer, ρΗ7.0. The homogenate is incubated on ice on a shaker for approximately 30 minutes. Then, the homogenate is filtered through a MiraCloth filter into a prechilled tube. The filtrate is transferred into centrifuge tubes, ℅ volume of chloroform is added and the solution is gently but thoroughly mixed for 20 minutes on ice. The mixture is centrifuged at 10,000 χ g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The upper aqueous phase is transferred into a fresh centrifugation tube and 1/10 volume of 12% sodium chloride and 1/5 volume of 25% PEG-6000 is added. The mixture is incubated on ice for approximately 1 hour and centrifuged at 10,000 χ gfor 15 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant is carefully removed and 1/5 volume of 0.1 Μ potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 is added. Finally, the mixture is incubated on ice until the pellet is dissolved. Quality of the viral particles is analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Approximately 12 mg purified TMV particles can be obtained from 6 g fresh leaf material. Conjugation of Her2-EC-Kappa with Tetanus Toxin-Fraqment-C-Kappa or TMV virus particles using qlutaraldehvde Her2-ED44-Kappa and Tetanus toxin Fragment C-Kappa or TMV viral particles are mixed (3 mg of each) for the conjugation reaction. Glutardialdehyde (25%) is added to the protein mixture to a final concentration of 0.1%. The mixture is incubated at room temperature for 2 hours and gently stirring. The reaction is stopped by addition of 2Μ glycine to a final concentration of 20 mM and incubation is continued for 30 minutes. The entire reaction is subjected to gel filtration for removal of remaining glutardialdehyde and non-conjugated proteins. The maximal volume of 2 ml of the reaction mixture was loaded onto a Superdex™ 200 column (GE Healthcare, #17-1043-02) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The mobile phase is PBS buffer pH 7.34 and the flow through was collected in 10 fractions over the entire peaks areas. The conjugation efficiency is analyzed (15 μI of each fraction) by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immunoblot analysis using anti-human Kappa antibodies (Sigma Aldrich, #Α7164). All conjugate containing fractions (molecular weight > 70 kDa) were pooled and concentrated using Spin-X UF concentrator 50k MWCO (Corning, #431490). Protein concentration of conjugate is determined using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo scientific #23225). Endotoxin determination was carried out using the Endosafe®-PTS system (Charles River Laboratories, #PTS100) with Endosafe®PTS cartridges, sensitivity 10-0.1EU/ml (Charles River Laboratories, #PTS201). EXAMPLE 3 Mice and experimental protocol BALB/c female mice aged between 6 and 10 weeks at the beginning of the procedures were kept in accordance with the Home Office Guidelines. Experiments were performed under Project Licence JR 70/6401 or AM 30/3028 and Personal Licence PIL 70/20084 (UoS). Mice are injected with 50 pg of Her2-ED44-His or conjugate vaccines containing an equivalent amount of Her2-ED44. Each mouse received either 50 pg of Her2-ED44, or 130 microgram of Her2-ED44-kappa-Fragment C-kappa, or 91 pg of Her2-ED44-kappa-TMV in 100 pL saline combined with an equal volume of alum adjuvant (Sigma). Before injections vaccines combined with alum were mixed end-over-end for 1h at ambient temperature. The injections are carried out subcutaneously into two sites in the flank. At least five mice per group were vaccinated per each experiment, except of Balb-NeuT where the group sizes were smaller. For the control vaccine 130 pg of plant expressed irrelevant protein (5T33lg-hkappa-Fragment C fusion protein made by ICON) was given. A comparator vaccine, Her2/Neu-EC-TM DNA vaccine (50 pg), was injected intramuscularly into two site. Wild-type mice are injected twice with the same amount of vaccine, second injection was given three weeks after the first one (Fig. 14). The mice were bled 3 weeks after the first injection and two times after second injection with two weeks interval between the bleeds (week 5 and week 7). Balb-NeuT transgenic mice were vaccinated 5 times with the first injection given at 10 weeks of age with the subsequent injection given every three weeks. Blood samples were taken 2 weeks after each injection. The samples were analysed by ELISA for reactivity against Her2-ED44 and for reactivity against membrane bound Her2/neu as well as for IgG isotypes and affinity. Serial blood sampling To detect vaccine-induced antibody responses, blood samples were taken from vaccinated mice by tail bleeding. Local anesthetic (Instillagal®, FARCO-PHARMA GmbH, Cologne, Germany) was applied to the tip of the tails and mice were warmed at 37 C for 5 min. A 1-2 mm section of the tip of the tail was cut with a scalpel and up to 200 pL of blood was removed per mouse. After clotting, whole blood was spun at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes and the serum was collected. Serum samples were preserved by the addition of 1 mL of 1 mM sodium azide and store at -20 C. Evaluation of anti-Her2-ED44 levels of total IqG antibody and antibody isotvoes bv ELISA For ELISA, 96-well flat bottomed Nunc Immunos™ ELISA plates (NUNC) were coated with Her2-ED44-His (3 pg/mL in carbonate/ bicarbonate buffer pH 9.6) overnight. The following day the plates were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at ambient temperature. Serial 4χ dilutions of samples ranging from 1/100 to 1/6400 for week 3 samples and ranging from 1/1000 to 1/64000 for every subsequent time point were added to the plates and incubated for 1.5 h on a shaker at 37°C. After 4 times washing with PBS/0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma # ρ1379) the detection anti-mouse IgG antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase (The Binding site, Birmingham, UK; # ΑΡ272; dilution 1/1000) was incubated with the plates for 1.5 h. Following another 4 washes with PBS/0.1%Tween the o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate (Sigma, # Ρ4664) was added and the reaction was allowed to develop and then stopped by the addition of 2.5 Μ H2S04.The optical density was measured at 490 nm using a Dynex MRX Plate reader. The results of the measurements are shown in Figures 15Α; 18Β; 20 and 21Β. For antibody isotype evaluation a similar protocol was applied but a different detection antibody was used as following anti-lgG1 (Biorbyt Ltd., Cat. No. orb27074), antilgG2a (Serotec # STAR13313, dilution 1/4000) and anti-lgG2b (Harlan Sera-Lab ltd# SBA 1090-05; dilution 1/1000). The serum antibody levels were calculated from a standard curve and expressed as arbitrary units per mL (Fig. 15, panel Β). Mammalian carcinoma cell lines TUBO cells are a cloned line derived from BALB/c mice which are transgenic for the transforming r-Her-2/neu oncogene (BALB-NeuT) (Rovero, 2000) and used in the binding assay to assess the reactivity with the rat Her2/neu. TUBO cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose (ΡΑΑ Laboratories) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and 20% FCS. When the cells reach 60-70% confluency they are incubated with TRYPSIN-EDTA(PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria) for 5-10 minutes at 37°C and then trypsin is stopped by split dilution. Splitting dilution can range from 1:3 to 1:6 or 1:8. The D2F2/E2 cells belong to a mammary tumor line from BALB/c mice which has been stably transfected with a vector expressing the human ERBB2 (Her2/neu) gene (Piechocki, Μ.Ρ., Pilon, S.A. & Wei, W.Z. 2001, J. Immunol., 167: 3367-3374). The D2F2/E2 cells were used in the binding assay to assess the reactivity with human Her2/neu. D2F2/E2 cell were cultured in high glucose DMEM supplemented with Penicillin-Streptomycin, 20% FCS and 800 pg/mL of G418 (Gibco). When confluent the cells were trypsinised and split by diluting between 1:4 and 1:8. For FACS analysis and tumour challenge experiments single cell suspensions are prepared by passing the cells through a syringe after trypsinisation. Evaluation of induced mouse antibody for binding to surface Her2 /neu by FACS analysis Binding of the induced antibody was analyzed by FACS staining using previously published protocols with modifications (Rovero, 2000). Briefly, 2x105 (either Tubo or D2F2/E2) cells were initially pre-incubated with serum from naive mice to reduce nonspecific binding and then with 1/100 dilution of the immune sera derived from vaccinated mice. The staining was carried out in a total volume of 100 pL. Secondary anti-mouse F(ab’)2 IgG labeled with eFluor660 (eBioscience# 50-4010-82, dilution 1/200), was used to detect the levels of induced antibody binding with a subsequent FACS analysis using FACS Callibur and Cell Quest software. The results of the measurements are shown in Figures 16-18 and 20. Tumour challenge experiments Protection experiments were performed using the TUBO cell line or the D2F2/E2 cell line. After two doses of vaccines mice were challenged with 105 tumor cells. The challenge was 4-6 weeks after the last vaccine injection. A group of mice which received no injections was used as an additional control. Mice were observed for the signs of tumours. Once tumours were visible they were measured every second day and mice with tumours ≥1.5 cm were humainly terminated. The survival graphs were produced using Graphpad PRISM 4.03 software. Statistical analysis to compare groups injected with different vaccines was performed using the Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric data. Inhibition of Her2/neu-mediated signaling by antibodies induced with hu Her 2 ED44-FrC conjugate vaccine The human HER2 positive breast cancer cell line ΒΤ474 was incubated separately with pooled sera from mice vaccinated at dilutions indicated, trastuzumab (Herceptin®, Roche, UK) or 30 ρΜ of PI3K (downstream of Her2 signalling) inhibitor LY294002 (Cell Signalling Technology, Massachusetts, USA) for 1 hour. All treatments were carried out in complete DMEM media supplemented with 10% FCS at 37°C, 10% C02. After the incubation, the cells were harvested, lysed and 10 pg of protein per sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE® Novex® 4-12% Bis-Tris Gels, Invitrogen Life Technologies, California, USA) after denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes. Following the electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Amersham Hybond™-P, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and after blocking in 5% non-fat milk in Tris buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1% Tween® 20, (TBS-T) were incubated sequentially with anti-pAkt (rabbit anti-phosphor-Akt (Ser473) antibody, Cell Signalling Technologies), Akt (rabbit anti-Akt antibody, Cell Signalling Technologies) or p-actin (mouse anti-human βactin antibody, clone 2F1-1, BioLegend) antibody at 1/1,000 dilution. Before applying each subsequent antibody, the previous antibody was stripped. After washing 3 times with TBS-Τ prior the membranes were incubated with 1/1,000 in TBS-T of the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, Cell Signalling Technologies or anti-mouse IgG (Gamma)(AFF)-PEROX, The Binding Site, Birmingham, UK) for 1 hour at room temperature. The membrane was washed 3 times with TBS-T again before detection with the SuperSignal™ West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Illinois, USA). The chemiluminescent signal was captured using Bio-Rad imaging system (Fluor-S® Multilmager, Bio-Rad). The results of Western blotting are shown in Figure 19.
