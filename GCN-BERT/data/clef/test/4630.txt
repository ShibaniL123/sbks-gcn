Prior Art. The development of a proper golf swing is critical to becoming a successful golfer. A proper golf swing includes a number of components including maintaining a proper swing plane throughout the entire course of the golf swing. The back swing, down swing, ball contact, and follow through combine together to form a circular arc swing path. Repetitive practice of a golf swing is desirable so that a proper golf swing becomes second nature. There are various known devices which train particular components of a golf swing. For example, a number of training devices assist in maintaining a head position of a golfer during a golf swing. Various devices affix a cord or tensioning member to a golf club so that the golf club is tethered to a point during the golf swing. Other devices are tethered to a sliding carriage. Various other devices retain a head, legs, or arms during the course of a golf swing. Prior patent references include Humphrey (U.S. Patent No. 4,449,708) which discloses a golf practice device having a track 11 with a sliding carriage 15 attached to a flexible tension member connected to a golf club.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific manners in which to make and use the invention and are not to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the instant invention. While the invention has been described with a certain degree of particularity, it is to be noted that many modifications may be made in the details of the invention's construction and the arrangement of its components without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure. It is understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth herein for purposes of exemplification. Referring to the drawings in detail, Figure 1 illustrates a perspective view of a golf swing training apparatus 10 mounted on a wall 12 (shown in dashed lines) and also showing a golfer user 14 (shown in dashed lines) swinging a golf club 16 (shown in dashed lines) and standing on a floor 18. The swing plane is illustrated by dashed lines 56. Figure 2 illustrates the golf swing training apparatus 10 shown in Figure 1 alone with arrows showing the various positions of the constituent elements to be described in detail herein. The apparatus 10 includes a tubular mounting bar 20 having a pair of opposed ends 22 and 24 which each terminate in a wall bracket 26 and 28, respectively, for attachment to a wall 12 by fasteners (not shown). It will be appreciated that other mechanisms for attachment of the mounting bar 20 might be employed within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Although the mounting bar 20 in a preferred embodiment is a hollow metal tube, other materials and configurations are possible. As best seen in Figure 1, when installed against a wall 12, the mounting bar 20 is substantially parallel to and spaced from the wall 12. In the configuration shown, the mounting bar 20 is also perpendicular to the floor 18. The mounting bar 20 may be fabricated from metal tubing. As will be described herein, the mounting bar remains stationary and affixed to the wall in all positions for both use and storage of the apparatus. The apparatus 10 includes an extendible length arm stabilizer 30. The arm stabilizer 30 extends from the mounting bar 20 and terminates at one end in a headrest or head stabilizer 32 which may take a number of configurations. The extendible length arm stabilizer is substantially perpendicular to the mounting bar. The headrest may include a flat pad or, alternatively, might be in the form of a ball or sphere. The golfer user 14 will rest his or her head against the head stabilizer 32, to discourage unwanted movement of the head or body during the swing. As best seen in Figure 2, the extendible length arm stabilizer 30 may include a first tube 34 having a first diameter and a second tube 36 having an outside diameter slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the first tube so that the second tube 36 telescopes with respect to the first tube 34. Accordingly, the position of the head stabilizer 32 may be adjusted as illustrated by arrow 38. The length of the arm stabilizer may be locked into a desired position by a quick release collar 40 or other mechanism, as are well known. The end of the arm stabilizer 30 opposed to the head stabilizer 32 is adjustably connected to the mounting bar 20. The first tube 34 is rigidly affixed to a tubular mounting sleeve 42 which has an inner diameter slightly larger than the outer diameter of the mounting bar 20. The mounting sleeve 42 is coaxial with the mounting bar. Accordingly, the mounting sleeve 42 and, in turn, the arm stabilizer 30, may be adjusted in height as illustrated by arrow 44. The tubular mounting sleeve 42 and the radially extending arm stabilizer 30 may also be radially adjusted as shown by arrows 39. The mounting sleeve 42 may be locked into a desired position by a pair of quick release collars 46 and 48, or other mechanisms, all as are well known. The apparatus 10 also includes a swing cam 50 shown in Figures 1 and 2 and also shown apart from the apparatus in Figures 6, 7, and 8. Figure 6 illustrates a perspective view, Figure 7 illustrates a front view, and Figure 8 illustrates a side view of the swing cam. The swing cam 50 engages and rotates about a swing cam assembly 52 which is mounted to the first tube 34 of the extendable length arm stabilizer 30 through a shaft 54 which passes through a diameter of the first tube 34. A guideline attachment post 60 extends radially outward from the swing cam 50. The swing cam 50 and the guideline attachment post 60 may be engaged with the swing cam assembly 52 through a series of bearings (not shown). Accordingly, the swing cam 50 and the attachment post 60 may rotate through 360° about an axis of the arm stabilizer 30 as illustrated by arrows 62 and 64 in Figure 7. The swing cam 50 and the swing cam assembly 52 may also be adjusted by rotating the swing cam assembly 52 about the shaft 54 passing through the arm stabilizer 30. As best seen in Figure 8, the swing cam assembly 52 may be adjusted to adjust the angle of the swing cam 50 and the extending guideline attachment post 60 as illustrated by arrows 66 and 68. The angle of the swing cam assembly 52 will be set substantially parallel to the swing plane 56 of the golfer as shown in Figure 1. The guideline attachment post 60 has a series of openings or apertures therethrough. Returning to a consideration of Figure 1 and also a side view of the apparatus 10 shown in Figure 9, an adjustable length guideline 70, which may be a cord or a rope, is attached at one end to the guideline attachment post 60 at a desired location on the attachment post. The length of the guideline may be adjusted such as with a loop and a friction fit clamp. An opposite end of the guideline 70 is removably affixed to the golf club 16 with a golf club connector which may take a variety of configurations. In the preferred embodiment shown, the golf club connector includes a ring 72 which slips over the end of the golf club 16 and a tab 74 extending from the ring 72 which may be held by the golfer user 14 during the golf swing. The guideline 70 will not permit the golf club to be moved further than the length of the guideline. It will also act as a visual reminder to retain the guideline 70 in a taut position during the entire swing. Because the swing cam 50 and extending attachment post 60 will rotate, the guideline 70 will follow the entire swing path of the golf club during the golf swing. The apparatus 10 also includes a pair of extending guide rods 80 and 82 which are seen in Figures 1 and 2 and also shown in Figures 3, 4 and 5. Each guide rod 80 and 82 is adjustable in length as illustrated by arrows 84 and 86, respectively, as shown in Figure 2. Each guide rod 80 and 82 may terminate in a soft bumper 88 and 90, respectively. At an opposite end of each guide rod 80 and 82 from the bumpers, each guide rod is adjustably connected to a shaft 92 and 94 which rotates within a guide rod mounting plate 96 shown from the top in Figure 3, from the bottom in Figure 4, and from the side in Figure 5. The guide rod 80 also includes a gear 98 while guide rod 82 includes a gear 100 which engage each other so that movement of one guide rod will cause movement of the other guide rod and so that the guide rods will stay equidistant from an angle formed by a plane through the mounting bar 20 perpendicular to the wall 12. The movement of the guide rods may be seen by the arrows 102 and 104 in Figure 4. The mounting plate 96 also rotates with respect to the mounting bar 20 through a shaft 106 as best seen by the arrows 108 and 110 in Figure 5. Each guide rod 80 and 82 may include an extending pin that travels in an arc slot in or through the mounting plate 96. Figure 10 illustrates a perspective view of the golf swing training apparatus which has been folded up after use for storage. The extendible arm stabilizer 30 has been rotated with respect to the mounting bar so it is adjacent to the wall 12. Likewise, the guide rods 80 and 82 and the accompanying mounting plate 96 have been rotated with respect to the mounting bar 20 so that mounting plate 96 is parallel and adjacent to the wall and the guide rods 80 and 82 are parallel to and adjacent to the wall. Figures 11, 12 and 13 illustrate a further, additional function of the golf swing training apparatus 10. With the extendible length arm stabilizer extending outward perpendicular from the wall (not shown in Figures 11, 12 and 13), the guide rods 80 and 82 would be rotated out of the way. The golfer 14 will hold at approximately chest level, a swing tempo and angle check bar while utilizing the head restraint or head rest 32 to position the head and body of the golfer. As shown in the sequential views in Figures 11, 12 and 13, the golfer will start with the bar 20 substantially parallel to the floor and then rotate the bar to simulate a back swing, down swing and follow through. The golfer will monitor the swing tempo and the swing angle of the bar throughout which encourages a smooth swing at a correct angle throughout.
