FEMALE URINATION AID FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to a portable urination aid. The present invention has particular but not exclusive application for use in assisting women to urinate in a standing or prone position. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There are circumstances where it is necessary or desirable for a woman to urinate when in a standing or a prone position rather than the usual squatting position. Circumstances where a woman may have to urinate in a prone or inclined position include those where a woman is confined to bed or immobilised for medical reasons such as illness, surgery, injury or childbirth. Bedpans and urinal bottles are readily available, but they are difficult to use and there is a likelihood of urine spillage on skin, clothing and bed linen. Circumstances where a woman may be forced to urinate in an upright, standing position include situations where toilet facilities are not available, inadequate or unsanitary. Public toilet facilities can be unhygienic and there may be reluctance to make contact with the toilet. Women can experience difficulties locating acceptable toilet facilities whilst travelling, camping, attending outdoor events, using public transport and participating in outdoor activities and sports. Extreme sports such as rock climbing can make the action of urinating particularly difficult or dangerous for a woman. Climatic conditions such as very cold temperatures can make it unsafe to remove clothing to urinate. The female anatomy does not allow a woman to control the direction of flow of discharging urine, particularly when they are in a standing or lying position. The urine flow cannot be directed away from the body, resulting in the risk of skin and clothing becoming wet. Furthermore, there is no facility to aim the urine flow in a specific direction or into a receptacle if required. This is a particular issue where it is necessary to produce a urine sample for testing for legal or medical purposes. Urinating may be difficult or painful for a woman following injury, childbirth or surgery; or if there is a skin condition such as a rash or infection present. There are problems and disadvantages for a woman trying to urinate when in a prone or standing position, in a difficult environment, or when suffering from certain medical conditions. OBJECT OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a urination aid that overcomes at least in part one or more of the abovementioned problems. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention concerns a urination aid for females and was developed by experimentation with different designs to direct discharge away from the body while at the same time being comfortable in forming a seal with the female body. In its development it was necessary to consider an aid that can be used by a variety of women with different shapes. The present invention broadly resides in a urination aid having a longitudinal body with an internal channel that is tapered from a first end to an opposite second end, said first end has a large aperture and the second end has a relatively smaller aperture, said larger aperture has a periphery that is angled relative to the longitudinal axis of the body. In another aspect the invention broadly resides in a urination aid having a longitudinal body with an internal channel that is tapered from a first end to an opposite second end, said first end has a large first aperture and the second end has a small second aperture, said first aperture and second apertures are substantially elliptical in shape but angled in opposite directions relative to the longitudinal axis of the body; said first aperture periphery has a rounded edge with a rounded point at an upper end of the angled first aperture periphery while the angled second aperture periphery has a low end so that the rounded point and the low end are aligned on the same side and on the same axis parallel with the longitudinal axis of the body when the urination aid is in a substantially vertical orientation; wherein the rounded point serves to position the urination aid on the woman and the low end serves to direct the discharge. Preferably the internal channel is continuously tapered from the first end to the opposite second end. Preferably the angle of the periphery of the first aperture is between 75° and 80° with respect to the longitudinal axis of the body. Preferably the size and shape of the first aperture enables close fitting with a woman’s genitalia and more particularly a woman’s vulva. Preferably the periphery or rim of the first aperture is substantially elliptical. Preferably a major axis of the substantially elliptical rim measures from 4.5 cm to 6.5 cm. More preferably the major axis measures from 5 cm to 6 cm. Most preferably the major axis is approximately 5.5 cm. Preferably the minor axis of the elliptical rim measures from 4.5 cm to 5.5 cm. Preferably the minor axis measures approximately 5 cm. Preferably the rim of the first aperture forms a rounded point adjacent an end of the major axis of the sloping aperture periphery. Preferably the rim is resilient to deformation. Preferably the rim is substantially rigid during handling and in use. Preferably the rim has a rounded edge. In a preferred aspect the rounded edge is an outwardly rolled lip. Preferably the urination aid is resilient to deformation. Preferably the urination aid is sufficiently rigid and resistant to deformation so that it retains a close fit to the vulva between the labia during use to guard against leakage and resist deformation due to the flow of urine. Preferably the body is longitudinally tapered with a continuous taper. Preferably the periphery of the second aperture is angled relative to the longitudinal axis of the body. Preferably the angle of the periphery of the second aperture with respect to the longitudinal axis of the body is in the opposite direction to the angle of the periphery of the first aperture. The angle of the plane of the periphery of the second aperture is preferably between 255° and 260°. Preferably the angled periphery of the second aperture forms a point that serves as a spout which directs the flow of urine away from the body when the urination aid is in use. Preferably the point on the periphery of the second aperture is positioned on the same side to the rounded point on the periphery of the first aperture relative to each other and the longitudinal axis through the body. The urination aid can be a single use disposable version. Alternatively it can be made of materials to allow it to be washed and reused. Preferably the urination aid is made from paper or card. More preferably the urination aid is made from stiff paper or card lined with a water proof or water resistant coating of wax or plastic. In an alternative embodiment the urination aid is made from plastics. The urination aid is used to assist a woman to urinate when she is in an upright or prone position. In one aspect multiple urination aids can be stacked, for example in a dispenser, to permit easy access to a urination aid in public toilets, surgeries, clinics and hospitals.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT With reference to Figures 1 to 6 there is shown a first preferred embodiment of the urination aid 10 for use in assisting a woman to urinate. The urination aid 10 has a longitudinal continuously tapered body 11 with a first aperture 12 and a second aperture 13. The first aperture 12 is larger than the second aperture 13. The first aperture 12 has a substantially elliptical rim 14 with a rounded edge 15. The plane of the elliptical rim 14 of the first aperture 12 is angled with respect to the longitudinal axis of the tapered body. The angle of the plane of the first aperture with respect to the longitudinal axis of the tapered body 11 is between 80° and 75°. The substantially elliptical rim 14 has a major axis and a minor axis. A pointed rim portion 18 is located adjacent an end of the major axis of the substantially elliptical rim 14. The second aperture 13 is angled in an opposite direction to the angle of the first aperture 12 thus forming a spout shape with the end of the spout 16 longitudinally aligned with the pointed rim portion 18 of rim 14. The tapered body 11 has an asymmetric elliptical cone shape with a truncated end. The major axis of the substantially elliptical first aperture 12 is approximately 5.5 cm. The minor axis of the first aperture 12 is approximately 5 cm. The longer side of the tapered body (measured from rounded point 18 to end of spout 16) is approximately 16.5 cm. The shorter side of the tapered body 11 measures approximately 15 cm. The second aperture measures approximately 1.5 cm. There are different embodiments of varying sizes to fit adult females and girls. The relative proportions of the urination aid remains substantially the same regardless of the absolute size. The size and shape of the first aperture 12 allows it to substantially conform to female genitalia when in use. In use, the first aperture 12 of the urination aid 10 is placed within the outer labia of the vulva over the woman’s urethral opening and clitoris with the rounded point 18 located towards the rear of the vulva and preferably located in the entrance of the vagina. The rim 14 of the first aperture 12 is gently pressed against the woman’s skin between the outer labia to form a seal which prevents leakage of urine. The rounded edge 15 allows the first aperture 12 of the urination aid 10 to form close contact with the skin without causing irritation or chafing. When the urination aid 10 is in position, the woman’s outer labia assist in keeping the urination aid 10 in place during use and ensures a close fit to minimize risk of leakage and splashing during urination. In use, exposure of the surrounding skin to urine is minimised, so there is little or no need to wash or wipe after urination. The substantially elliptical rim 14 and planar nature of the first aperture 12 of the urination aid 10 ensures a close fit with a wide range of shapes and sizes of female genitalia. This close fit prevents or minimises undesirable leakage of urine during use. The rounded point 18 assists the user in locating the urination aid in the optimum position. When in position, the dimensions of the longitudinal body 11 together with the angle of the first aperture 12 are such that the urination aid 10 can handle the urine flow without it backing up, allowing efficient outflow from the urethra. When the user is standing upright, the urine flow is directed through the longitudinal body 11 in a forward and downward direction until the urine exits from the second aperture 13. This keeps the urine flow away from the user’s body and clothing, thus allowing skin and clothing to remain dry. If the woman is lying down, or in an inclined or squatting position, the urine flow can be easily directed into a suitable receptacle. The overall dimensions of the urination aid 10 make it suitable for carrying in a handbag, rucksack or other types of hand luggage. The length of the urination aid 10 is sufficient to ensure that the urine flow is conducted to an adequate distance from the body and clothing to avoid splashing and seepage. The slope of the first aperture 12 together with the spout formed by slope of the second aperture 13 forms a natural conduit allowing the urine to flow clear of the body and clothing. The urination aid 10 can be used by adjusting the underwear (for example, by drawing it to the side) if necessary in the event that it is difficult or impractical to remove or completely pull down clothing to permit urination. The urination aid 10 is uncomplicated in design, lightweight and portable. It is ready to use, and requires no construction, unfolding or adjustment before use. This aspect is particularly advantageous for the elderly, disabled or infirm; or for those with injuries. The urination aid 10 is also particularly suitable for use in poor light or harsh environmental conditions where it may be difficult or time consuming to prepare a urination aid for use. The urination aid 10 may be used in conjunction with a vessel such as a urinal, toilet, bed pan, urine bottle or specimen vial. The urination aid 10 is therefore useful in hospitals or other medical environments. The urination aid 10 facilitates urinating in a bedpan, making it an easier, cleaner and less stressful experience than using a bedpan on its own. The urination aid 10 simplifies the process of directing urine into a sample jar without spillage thus making it quicker, easier, convenient and efficient to provide a urine sample for medical or legal purposes. Alternatively, the urination aid 10 may be used, for example in an outdoor setting, in the absence of an additional vessel to capture the excreted urine. The urination aid 10 can find application during outdoor activities such as camping, outdoor events, travelling and sports. The urination aid 10 of the present invention can be, for example, a single use disposable version or a washable, multiple use version. The urination aid 10 can be made from a variety of materials, providing that the material is waterproof during use and has sufficient resilience and rigidity to allow it to maintain close contact with the vulva during use and resist deformation due to the flow of urine. A single use urination aid 10 is preferably readily disposable and can be made from board, paper or card. The urination aid is preferably made from board having a weight of approximately 170 to 350 gnr2. The board is formed into the desired shape for the urination aid by conventional manufacturing processes. The rolled rim is formed by processes known in the art to provide the required stiffness and handling properties. The urination aid is preferably waterproofed to prevent urine from leaking during use. Waterproofing may be achieved by lining the interior surfaces of the urination aid with a layer of wax or plastic (such as polyethylene) during manufacture. The waterproofing layer can be applied in accordance with conventional methods, for example by spray application. A single use urination aid can also be manufactured from known biodegradable materials making it particularly suitable for outdoor use and disposal. A biodegradable urination aid can be prepared by coated a board urination device with a waterproof lining of a biodegradable plastic such as poly(lactic acid). The urination aid 10 can also be made from plastic material which is lightweight and easily cleaned such as synthetic rubber, silicones, polyethylene, polypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate. Methods of moulding plastics are known in the art. A plastic urination aid can be washed, dried and reused many times. The plastic can be treated using known methods to provide, for example, an antibacterial material to improve hygiene or a hydrophobic surface to ensure rapid drying. The urination aid 10 may be made from coloured material, or may have decoration or colour applied to the outer surface. The urination aid 10 can be used for advertising or other information dissemination purposes. The urination aid 10 may be used in conjunction with a urinal, toilet, bed pan, urine bottle and the like. Alternatively the urination aid 10 may be used outdoors with no additional vessel. Urination aids of the present invention are of suitable shape and configuration for stacking, for example for arrangement in a dispenser. Such a dispenser can be provided in public toilets, surgeries, clinics, hospitals and the like. ADVANTAGES An advantage of a preferred embodiment of the urination aid is that it allows a woman to urinate whilst in an upright position without having to remove clothing. The urination aid contacts the vulva and forms a seal when in position during urination, thus preventing leakage which may lead to wet skin and clothing. It reduces the need for wiping or washing the skin after urination. The substantially elliptical rim and planar nature of the first aperture of the urination aid enables a close fit with a wide range of shapes and sizes of female genitalia. This close fit substantially prevents undesirable leakage of urine during use. The dimensions and configuration of the urination aid allow the flow of urine to be directed away from the body and clothing without backing up or splashing. The rounded or rolled edge of the rim of the first aperture allows the urination aid to form close contact with the vulva without causing damage to delicate skin. This is particularly useful where there is skin or tissue damage present due to disease, rashes or infection; or following injury, surgery or childbirth. The urination aid is uncomplicated, lightweight and portable. It is ready to use, and requires no unfolding or construction. The device is cheap to produce and simple to use. In one embodiment it is easy to clean and maintain. In another embodiment it is simple to dispose of.
