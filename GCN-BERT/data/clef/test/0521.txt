[Step 4] Synthesis of N-((5-(2-(2,2-difluoroacetyl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)pyridin-2-yl)methyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)nicotinamide
N-(3-fluorophenyl)-N-((5-(hydrazinecarbonyl)pyridin-2-yl)methyl)nicotinamide (0.111 g, 0.304 mmol), synthesized in step 3, and triethylamine (0.085 mL, 0.608 mmol) were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) at room temperature, and 2,2-difluoroacetic anhydride (0.050 mL, 0.456 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at 80Â°C for 18 hours, and then cooled to room temperature to terminate the reaction. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The title compound was used without further purification (0.133 g, 98.7%) as colorless oil.
