PROCESS FOR PRODUCING BTX FROM A MIXED HYDROCARBON SOURCE USI NG CATALYTI C CRACKI NG The present invention relates to a process for producing BTX comprising catalytic cracking, aromatic ring opening and BTX recovery. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a process installation to convert a hydrocarbon feedstream into BTX comprising a catalytic cracking unit, an aromatic ring opening unit and a BTX recovery unit. It has been previously described that aromatic hydrocarbons comprising p-xylene can be produced from a hydrocarbon feedstream by a process comprising the steps of: producing a naphtha fraction and a light cycle oil fraction from a catalytic cracking zone; combining the gasoline and light cycle oil fractions; hydrotreating the combined gasoline and light cycle oil fractions to produce a hydrotreated product; fractionating the hydrotreated product in a fractionation zone to make a light ends cut, a naphtha cut, a hydrocracker feed and an unconverted oil fraction; sending the hydrocracker feed to a hydrocracking zone to make a hydrocracker product; recycling the hydrocracker product to the fractionation zone, feeding the hydrocracker product above an outlet for the hydrocracker feed, but below an outlet for the naphtha cut; sending the naphtha cut to a dehydrogenation zone to make a dehydrogenated naphtha; and the dehydrogenated naphtha to an aromatics recovery unit to recover p-xylene and other arom atics; see WO 2013/ 052228 A1. A major drawback of the process of WO 2013/052228 A1 is that the aromatics yield is relatively low. It was an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing BTX from a mixed hydrocarbon stream having an improved yield of high-value petrochemical products, preferably BTXE. The solution to the above problem is achieved by providing the embodiments as described herein below and as characterized in the claims. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for producing BTX comprising: (a) subjecting a hydrocarbon feedstream to catalytic cracking to produce catalytic cracking gasoline and cycle oil; (b) subjecting cycle oil to aromatic ring opening to produce BTX; and (c) recovering BTX from catalytic cracking gasoline. In the context of the present invention, it was surprisingly found that the yield of high-value petrochemical products, such as BTX, can be improved by using the improved process as described herein. For instance, the maximum theoretical BTXE production shown in WO 2013/052228 can be estimated in 28 wt-% of the feed. This estimation is based on the claimed conversion (98 wt-%) of the mixture of gasoline and LCO (usually 75% of the feed to the FCC unit) and the selectivity towards aromatics (38 wt-%). In the case of the present invention, it can be demonstrated that battery-limit BTXE yields of more than 35 wt-% of the feed can be obtained when arom atization processes are employed to further process the gases generated by the overall complex. US 2008/0156696 A1 describes a FCC process for converting C3/C4 feeds to olefins and aromatics comprising cracking a first hydrocarbon feed that preferably comprises gas oil in a first riser and cracking a second hydrocarbon feed comprising light hydrocarbons having three and/or four carbon atoms in a second riser. US 2008/0156696 A1 discloses that certain heavy stream that are produced in the FCC process may be recycled to the second riser. The process of US 2008/0156696 A1 aims to convert inexpensive C3/C4 feedstocks such as LPG to aromatics using an FCC unit. Furthermore, US 2008/0156696 A1 teaches that it is advantageous to feed a heavy feedstock to a FCC process as a coke precursor when processing a light feed in a FCC process in order to produce sufficient coke to operate the FCC process in heat balance. US 2008/0156696 A1 merely describes recycling to the FCC unit and thus fails to provide a process wherein cycle oils are subjected to an aromatic ring opening unit. In the process of the present invention, any hydrocarbon composition that is suitable as a feed for catalytic cracking can be used. Preferably, the hydrocarbon feedstream comprises one or more selected from the group consisting of naphtha, kerosene, gasoil and resid. More preferably, the hydrocarbon feedstream comprises gasoil, most preferably vacuum gasoil. Depending on the hydrogen content of the feed, it may be beneficial to increase the hydrogen content of the hydrocarbon feedstream by hydrotreatment prior to subjecting the hydrocarbon feedstream to catalytic cracking. Methods for increasing the hydrogen content of a hydrocarbon feedstream are well known in the art and include hydrotreating. Preferably, the hydrotreating comprises contacting the hydrocarbon feedstream in the presence of hydrogen with a hydrogenation catalyst commonly comprising a hydrogenation metal, such as Ni, Mo, Co, W, Pt and Pd, with or without promoters, supported on an inert support such as alumina. The process conditions used for hydrotreating the hydrocarbon feedstream generally comprise a process temperature of 200-450 °C, preferably of 300-425 °C and a pressure of 1- 25 MPa, preferably 2-20 MPa gauge. In case resid is used as a feed, it may be specifically subjected to solvent deasphalting before subjecting to catalytic cracking. Preferably, the resid is further fractioned, e.g. using a vacuum distillation unit, to separate the resid into a vacuum gas oil fraction and vacuum residue fraction. Preferably, the feed used in the process of the present invention comprises less than 8%wt asphaltenes, more preferably less than 5 %wt asphaltenes. Preferably, the feed used used in the process of the present invention comprises less than 20 ppmwt metals. The terms naphtha, kerosene, gasoil and resid are used herein having their generally accepted meaning in the field of petroleum refinery processes; see Alfke et al. (2007) Oil Refining, Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry and Speight (2005) Petroleum Refinery Processes, Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. In this respect, it is to be noted that there may be overlap between the different crude oil fractions due to the complex mixture of the hydrocarbon compounds comprised in the crude oil and the technical limits to the crude oil distillation process. Preferably, the term "naphtha" as used herein relates to the petroleum fraction obtained by crude oil distillation having a boiling point range of about 20-200 °C, more preferably of about 30-190 °C. Preferably, light naphtha is the fraction having a boiling point range of about 20-100 °C, more preferably of about 30-90 °C. Heavy naphtha preferably has a boiling point range of about 80-200 °C, more preferably of about 90-190 °C. Preferably, the term "kerosene" as used herein relates to the petroleum fraction obtained by crude oil distillation having a boiling point range of about 180-270 °C, more preferably of about 190-260 °C. Preferably, the term "gasoil" as used herein relates to the petroleum fraction obtained by crude oil distillation having a boiling point range of about 250-360 °C, more preferably of about 260-350 °C. Preferably, the term "resid" as used herein relates to the petroleum fraction obtained by crude oil distillation having a boiling point of more than about 340 °C, more preferably of more than about 350 °C. The process of the present invention involves catalytic cracking, which comprises contacting the feedstream with a catalytic cracking-catalyst under catalytic cracking conditions. The process conditions useful in catalytic cracking, also described herein as "catalytic cracking conditions", can be easily determined by the person skilled in the art; see Alfke et al. (2007) loc. cit. The term "catalytic cracking" is used herein in its generally accepted sense and thus may be defined as a process to convert a feedstream comprising high-boiling, high- molecular weight hydrocarbon fractions of petroleum crude oils to lower boiling point hydrocarbon fractions and olefinic gases by contacting said feedstream with a catalytic cracking catalyst at catalytic cracking conditions. Preferably, the catalytic cracking used in the process of the present invention comprising contacting the feedstream with an catalytic cracking catalyst under catalytic cracking conditions, wherein the catalytic cracking catalyst comprises an porous catalyst having acidic catalytic sites, preferably a zeolite, and wherein the catalytic cracking conditions comprise a temperature of 400-800 °C and a pressure of 10-800 kPa gauge. Preferably, the catalytic cracking is performed in a "fluid catalytic cracker unit" or "FCC unit". Accordingly, the preferred catalytic cracking employed in the process of the present invention is fluid catalytic cracking or FCC. In a FCC unit, catalytic cracking takes place generally using a very active zeolite-based catalyst in a short- contact time vertical or upward-sloped pipe called the "riser". Pre-heated feed is sprayed into the base of the riser via feed nozzles where it contacts extremely hot fluidized catalyst. Preferred process conditions used for fluid catalytic cracking generally include a temperature of 425-730 °C and a pressure of 10-800 kPa gauge. The hot catalyst vaporizes the feed and catalyzes the cracking reactions that break down the high-molecular weight hydrocarbons into lighter components including LPG, light-distillate and middle-distillate. The catalyst/hydrocarbon mixture flows upward through the riser for a few seconds, and then the mixture is separated via cyclones. The catalyst-free hydrocarbons are routed to a main fractionator (a component of the FCC unit for separation into fuel gas (methane), C2-C4 hydrocarbons, FCC gasoline, light cycle oil and, eventually, a heavy cycle oil. The C2-C4 hydrocarbons fraction produced by FCC generally is a mixture of paraffins and olefins. As used herein, the term "catalytic cracking gasoline" relates to the light- distillate produced by catalytic cracking that is relatively rich in mono-aromatic hydrocarbons. As used herein, the term "cycle oil" relates to the middle-distillate and heavy-distillate produced by catalytic cracking that is relatively rich in hydrocarbons having condensed aromatic rings. As used herein, the term "light cycle oil" relates to the middle-distillate produced by catalytic cracking that is relatively rich in aromatic hydrocarbons having two condensed aromatic rings. As used herein, the term "heavy cycle oil" relates to the heavy-distillate produced by catalytic cracking that is relatively rich in hydrocarbons having more than 2 condensed aromatic rings. Spent catalyst is disengaged from the cracked hydrocarbon vapors and sent to a stripper where it is contacted with steam to remove hydrocarbons remaining in the catalyst pores. The spent catalyst then flows into a fluidized-bed regenerator where air (or in some cases air plus oxygen) is used to burn off the coke to restore catalyst activity and also provide the necessary heat for the next reaction cycle, cracking being an endothermic reaction. The regenerated catalyst then flows to the base of the riser, repeating the cycle. The process of the present invention may comprise several FCC units operated at different process conditions, depending on the hydrocarbon feed and the desired product slate. As used herein, the term "low-severity FCC" or "refinery FCC" relates to a FCC process that is optimized towards the production of catalytic cracking gasoline. Most conventional refineries are optimized towards gasoline production, conventional FCC process operating conditions can be considered to represent low-severity FCC. Preferred process conditions used for refinery FCC generally include a temperature of 425-570 °C and a pressure of 10- 800 kPa gauge. Preferably, the catalytic cracking used in the process of the present invention is fluid catalytic cracking comprising contacting the feedstream with an FCC catalyst under FCC conditions, wherein the FCC catalyst comprises zeolite and wherein the FCC conditions comprise a temperature of 425-730 °C and a pressure of 10-800 kPa gauge. More preferably, the fluid catalytic cracking used in the process of the present invention is high-severity FCC, preferably comprising temperature of 540-730 °C and a pressure of 10-800 kPa gauge. As used herein, the term "high-severity FCC" or "petrochemicals FCC" relates to a FCC process that is optimized towards the production of olefins. High-severity FCC processes are known from the prior art and are inter alia described in EP 0 909 804 A2, EP 0 909582 A1 and US 5,846,402. Preferred process conditions used for high- severity FCC generally include a temperature of 540-730 °C and a pressure of 10- 800 kPa gauge. The term "alkane" or "alkanes" is used herein having its established meaning and accordingly describes acyclic branched or unbranched hydrocarbons having the general formula C and therefore consisting entirely of hydrogen atoms and saturated carbon atoms; see e.g. lUPAC. Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (1997). The term "alkanes" accordingly describes unbranched alkanes ("normal- paraffins" or "n-paraffins" or "n-alkanes") and branched alkanes (" iso-paraffins" or "iso-alkanes") but excludes naphthenes (cycloalkanes) . The term "aromatic hydrocarbons" or "aromatics" is very well known in the art. Accordingly, the term "aromatic hydrocarbon" relates to cyclically conjugated hydrocarbon with a stability (due to derealization) that is significantly greater than that of a hypothetical localized structure (e.g. Kekule structure). The most common method for determining aromaticity of a given hydrocarbon is the observation of diatropicity in the 1 H NMR spectrum, for example the presence of chemical shifts in the range of from 7.2 to 7.3 ppm for benzene ring protons. The terms "naphthenic hydrocarbons" or "naphthenes" or "cycloalkanes" is used herein having its established meaning and accordingly describes saturated cyclic hydrocarbons. The term "olefin" is used herein having its well-established meaning. Accordingly, olefin relates to an unsaturated hydrocarbon compound containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Preferably, the term "olefins" relates to a mixture comprising two or more of ethylene, propylene, butadiene, butylene-1, isobutylene, isoprene and cyclopentadiene. The term "LPG" as used herein refers to the well-established acronym for the term "liquefied petroleum gas". LPG generally consists of a blend of C2-C4 hydrocarbons i.e. a mixture of ethane, propane and butanes and, depending on the source, also ethylene, propylene and butylenes. As used herein, the term "C# hydrocarbons", wherein "#" is a positive integer, is meant to describe all hydrocarbons having # carbon atoms. Moreover, the term "C#+ hydrocarbons" is meant to describe all hydrocarbon molecules having # or more carbon atoms. Accordingly, the term "C5+ hydrocarbons" is meant to describe a mixture of hydrocarbons having 5 or more carbon atoms. The term "C5+ alkanes" accordingly relates to alkanes having 5 or more carbon atoms. The terms light-distillate, middle-distillate and heavy-distillate are used herein having their generally accepted meaning in the field of petroleum refinery processes; see Speight, J. G. (2005) loc.cit. In this respect, it is to be noted that there may be overlap between different distillation fractions due to the complex mixture of the hydrocarbon compounds comprised in the product stream produced by refinery or petrochemical unit operations and the technical limits to the distillation process used to separate the different fractions. Preferably, a "light-distillate" is a hydrocarbon distillate obtained in a refinery or petrochemical process having a boiling point range of about 20-200 °C, more preferably of about 30-190 °C. The "light-distillate" is often relatively rich in aromatic hydrocarbons having one aromatic ring. Preferably, a "middle-distillate" is a hydrocarbon distillate obtained in a refinery or petrochemical process having a boiling point range of about 180-360 °C, more preferably of about 190-350 °C. The "middle-distillate" is relatively rich in aromatic hydrocarbons having two aromatic rings. Preferably, a "heavy-distillate" is a hydrocarbon distillate obtained in a refinery or petrochemical process having a boiling point of more than about 340 °C, more preferably of more than about 350 °C. The "heavy-distillate" is relatively rich in hydrocarbons having more than 2 aromatic rings. Accordingly, a refinery or petrochemical process-derived distillate is obtained as the result of a chemical conversion followed by a fractionation, e.g. by distillation or by extraction, which is in contrast to a crude oil fraction. The process of the present invention involves aromatic ring opening, which comprises contacting the cycle oil in the presence of hydrogen with an aromatic ring opening catalyst under aromatic ring opening conditions. The process conditions useful in aromatic ring opening, also described herein as "aromatic ring opening conditions", can be easily determined by the person skilled in the art; see e.g. US3256176, US4789457 and US 7,513,988. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for producing BTX comprising: (a) subjecting a hydrocarbon feedstream to catalytic cracking to produce catalytic cracking gasoline and cycle oil; (b) subjecting cycle oil in the presence of hydrogen to aromatic ring opening to produce BTX; and (c) recovering BTX from catalytic cracking gasoline. The term "aromatic ring opening" is used herein in its generally accepted sense and thus may be defined as a process to convert a hydrocarbon feed that is relatively rich in hydrocarbons having condensed aromatic rings, such as cycle oil, to produce a product stream comprising a light-distillate that is relatively rich in BTX (ARO- derived gasoline) and preferably LPG. Such an aromatic ring opening process (ARO process) is for instance described in US3256176 and US4789457. Such processes may comprise of either a single fixed bed catalytic reactor or two such reactors in series together with one or more fractionation units to separate desired products from unconverted material and may also incorporate the ability to recycle unconverted material to one or both of the reactors. Reactors may be operated at a temperature of 200-600 °C, preferably 300-400 °C, a pressure of 3-35 MPa, preferably 5 to 20MPa together with 5-20 wt-% of hydrogen (in relation to the hydrocarbon feedstock), wherein said hydrogen may flow co-current with the hydrocarbon feedstock or counter current to the direction of flow of the hydrocarbon feedstock, in the presence of a dual functional catalyst active for both hydrogenation-dehydrogenation and ring cleavage, wherein said aromatic ring saturation and ring cleavage may be performed. Catalysts used in such processes comprise one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Pd, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os, Cu, Co, Ni, Pt, Fe, Zn, Ga, In, Mo, W and V in metallic or metal sulphide form supported on an acidic solid such as alumina, silica, alumina-silica and zeolites. In this respect, it is to be noted that the term "supported on" as used herein includes any conventional way to provide a catalyst which combines one or more elements with a catalytic support. By adapting either single or in combination the catalyst composition, operating temperature, operating space velocity and/or hydrogen partial pressure, the process can be steered towards full saturation and subsequent cleavage of all rings or towards keeping one aromatic ring unsaturated and subsequent cleavage of all but one ring. In the latter case, the ARO process produces a Iight-distillate ("ARO-gasoline") which is relatively rich in hydrocarbon compounds having one aromatic and or naphthenic ring. In the context of the present invention, it is preferred to use an aromatic ring opening process that is optimized to keep one aromatic or naphthenic ring intact and thus to produce a Iight-distillate which is relatively rich in hydrocarbon compounds having one aromatic or naphthenic ring. A further aromatic ring opening process (ARO process) is described in US 7,513,988. Accordingly, the ARO process may comprise aromatic ring saturation at a temperature of 100-500 °C, preferably 200-500 °C, more preferably 300-500 °C, a pressure of 2-10 MPa together with 1 -30 wt-%, preferably 5-30 wt-% of hydrogen (in relation to the hydrocarbon feedstock) in the presence of an aromatic hydrogenation catalyst and ring cleavage at a temperature of 200-600 °C, preferably 300-400 °C, a pressure of 1-12 MPa together with 1 -20 wt-% of hydrogen (in relation to the hydrocarbon feedstock) in the presence of a ring cleavage catalyst, wherein said aromatic ring saturation and ring cleavage may be performed in one reactor or in two consecutive reactors. The aromatic hydrogenation catalyst may be a conventional hydrogenation/hydrotreating catalyst such as a catalyst comprising a mixture of Ni, W and Mo on a refractory support, typically alumina. The ring cleavage catalyst comprises a transition metal or metal sulphide component and a support. Preferably the catalyst comprises one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Pd, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os, Cu, Co, Ni, Pt, Fe, Zn, Ga, In, Mo, W and V in metallic or metal sulphide form supported on an acidic solid such as alumina, silica, alumina-silica and zeolites. In this respect, it is to be noted that the term "supported on" as used herein includes any conventional way of to provide a catalyst which combines one or more elements with a catalyst support. By adapting either single or in combination the catalyst composition, operating temperature, operating space velocity and/or hydrogen partial pressure, the process can be steered towards full saturation and subsequent cleavage of all rings or towards keeping one aromatic ring unsaturated and subsequent cleavage of all but one ring. In the latter case, the ARO process produces a light-distillate ("ARO- gasoline") which is relatively rich in hydrocarbon compounds having one aromatic ring. In the context of the present invention, it is preferred to use an aromatic ring opening process that is optimized to keep one aromatic ring intact and thus to produce a light-distillate which is relatively rich in hydrocarbon compounds having one aromatic ring. Preferably, the aromatic ring opening comprises contacting the cycle oil in the presence of hydrogen with an aromatic ring opening catalyst under aromatic ring opening conditions, wherein the aromatic ring opening catalyst comprises a transition metal or metal sulphide component and a support, preferably comprising one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Pd, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os, Cu, Co, Ni, Pt, Fe, Zn, Ga, In, Mo, W and V in metallic or metal sulphide form supported on an acidic solid, preferably selected from the group consisting of alumina, silica, alumina-silica and zeolites and wherein the aromatic ring opening conditions com prise a tern perature of 100-600 °C, a pressure of 1-12 MPa. Preferably, the aromatic ring opening conditions further comprise the presence of 1-30 wt-% of hydrogen (in relation to the hydrocarbon feedstock. Preferably, the aromatic ring opening catalyst comprises an aromatic hydrogenation catalyst comprising one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Ni, W and Mo on a refractory support, preferably alumina; and a ring cleavage catalyst comprising a transition metal or metal sulphide component and a support, preferably comprising one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Pd, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os, Cu, Co, Ni, Pt, Fe, Zn, Ga, In, Mo, W and V in metallic or metal sulphide form supported on an acidic solid, preferably selected from the group consisting of alumina, silica, alumina-silica and zeolites, and wherein the conditions for aromatic hydrogenation comprise a temperature of 100-500 °C, preferably 200-500 °C, more preferably 300-500 °C, a pressure of 2-10 MPa and the presence of 1 -30 wt-%, preferably 5-30 wt-%, of hydrogen (in relation to the hydrocarbon feedstock) and wherein the ring cleavage comprises a temperature of 200-600 °C, preferably 300- 400 °C, a pressure of 1-12 MPa and the presence of 1-20 wt-% of hydrogen (in relation to the hydrocarbon feedstock). The process of the present invention involves recovery of BTX from a mixed hydrocarbon stream comprising aromatic hydrocarbons, such as catalytic cracking gasoline. Any conventional means for separating BTX from a mixed hydrocarbons stream may be used to recover the BTX. One such suitable means for BTX recovery involves conventional solvent extraction. The catalytic cracking gasoline and light- distillate may be subjected to "gasoline treatment" prior to solvent extraction. As used herein, the term "gasoline treatment" or "gasoline hydrotreatment" relates to a process wherein an unsaturated and aromatics-rich hydrocarbon feedstream, such as catalytic cracking gasoline, is selectively hydrotreated so that the carbon-carbon double bonds of the olefins and di-olefins comprised in said feedstream are hydrogenated; see also US 3,556,983. Conventionally, a gasoline treatment unit may include a first-stage process to improve the stability of the aromatics-rich hydrocarbon stream by selectively hydrogenating diolefins and alkenyl compounds thus making it suitable for further processing in a second stage. The first stage hydrogenation reaction is carried out using a hydrogenation catalyst commonly comprising Ni and/or Pd, with or without promoters, supported on alumina in a fixed-bed reactor. The first stage hydrogenation is commonly performed in the liquid phase comprising a process inlet temperature of 200 °C or less, preferably of 30-100 °C. In a second stage, the first-stage hydrotreated aromatics-rich hydrocarbon stream may be further processed to prepare a feedstock suitable for aromatics recovery by selectively hydrogenating the olefins and removing sulfur via hydrodesulfurization. In the second stage hydrogenation a hydrogenation catalyst is commonly used comprising elements selected from the group consisting of Ni, Mo, Co, W and Pt, with or without promoters, supported on alumina in a fixed-bed reactor, wherein the catalyst is in a sulfide form. The process conditions generally comprise a process temperature of 200-400 °C, preferably of 250-350 °C and a pressure of 1-3.5 MPa, preferably 2-3.5 MPa gauge. The aromatics-rich product produced by the GTU is then further subject to BTX recovery using conventional solvent extraction. In case the aromatics-rich hydrocarbon mixture that is to be subjected to the gasoline treatment is low in diolefins and alkenyl compounds, the aromatics-rich hydrocarbon stream can be directly subjected to the second stage hydrogenation or even directly subjected to aromatics extraction. Preferably, the gasoline treatment unit is a hydrocracking unit as described herein below that is suitable for converting a feedstream that is rich in aromatic hydrocarbons having one aromatic ring into purified BTX. The product produced in the process of the present invention is BTX. The term "BTX" as used herein relates to a mixture of benzene, toluene and xylenes. Preferably, the product produced in the process of the present invention comprises further useful aromatic hydrocarbons such as ethylbenzene. Accordingly, the present invention preferably provides a process for producing a mixture of benzene, toluene xylenes and ethylbenzene ("BTXE"). The product as produced may be a physical mixture of the different aromatic hydrocarbons or may be directly subjected to further separation, e.g. by distillation, to provide different purified product streams. Such purified product stream may include a benzene product stream, a toluene product stream, a xylene product stream and/or an ethylbenzene product stream. Preferably, the aromatic ring opening further produces light-distillate and wherein the BTX is recovered from said light-distillate. Preferably, the BTX produced by aromatic ring opening is comprised in the light-distillate. In this embodiment, the BTX comprised in the light-distillate is separated from the other hydrocarbons comprised in said light-distillate by the BTX recovery. Preferably the BTX is recovered from the catalytic cracking gasoline and/or from the light-distillate by subjecting said catalytic cracking gasoline and/or light-distillate to hydrocracking. By selecting hydrocracking for the BTX recovery over solvent extraction, the BTX yield of the process of the present invention can be improved since mono-aromatic hydrocarbons other than BTX can be converted into BTX by hydrocracking. Preferably, the catalytic cracking gasoline is hydrotreated before subjecting to hydrocracking to saturate all olefins and diolefins. By removing the olefins and diolefins in the catalytic cracking gasoline, the exotherm during hydrocracking can be better controlled, thus improving operability. More preferably, the olefins and diolefins are separated from the catalytic cracking gasoline using conventional methods such as described in US 7,019,188 and WO 01/59033 A1. Preferably, the olefins and diolefins, which were separated from the catalytic cracking gasoline, are subjected to aromatization, thereby improving the BTX yield of the process of the present invention. The process of the present invention may involve hydrocracking, which comprises contacting the catalytic cracking gasoline and preferably the light-distillate in the presence of hydrogen with a hydrocracking catalyst under hydrocracking conditions. The process conditions useful hydrocracking, also described herein as "hydrocracking conditions", can be easily determined by the person skilled in the art; see Alfke et al. (2007) loc.cit. Preferably, the catalytic cracking gasoline is subjected to gasoline hydrotreatment as described herein above before subjecting to hydrocracking. Preferably, the C9+ hydrocarbons comprised in the hydrocracked product stream are recycled either to the hydrocracker or, preferably, to aromatic ring opening. The term "hydrocracking" is used herein in its generally accepted sense and thus may be defined as catalytic cracking process assisted by the presence of an elevated partial pressure of hydrogen; see e.g. Alfke et al. (2007) loc.cit. The products of this process are saturated hydrocarbons and, depending on the reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure and space velocity and catalyst activity, aromatic hydrocarbons including BTX. The process conditions used for hydrocracking generally includes a process temperature of 200-600 °C, elevated pressures of 0.2-20 MPa, space velocities between 0.1-20 h 1. Hydrocracking reactions proceed through a bifunctional mechanism which requires an acid function, which provides for the cracking and isomerization and which provides breaking and/or rearrangement of the carbon-carbon bonds comprised in the hydrocarbon compounds comprised in the feed, and a hydrogenation function. Many catalysts used for the hydrocracking process are formed by combining various transition metals, or metal sulfides with the solid support such as alumina, silica, alumina-silica, magnesia and zeolites. Preferably the BTX is recovered from the catalytic cracking gasoline and/or from the light-distillate by subjecting said catalytic cracking gasoline and/or light-distillate to gasoline hydrocracking. As used herein, the term "gasoline hydrocracking" or "GHC" refers to a hydrocracking process that is particularly suitable for converting a complex hydrocarbon feed that is relatively rich in aromatic hydrocarbon compounds -such as FCC gasoline- to LPG and BTX, wherein said process is optimized to keep one aromatic ring intact of the aromatics comprised in the GHC feedstream, but to remove most of the side-chains from said aromatic ring. Accordingly, the main product produced by gasoline hydrocracking is BTX and the process can be optimized to provide chemicals-grade BTX. Preferably, the hydrocarbon feed that is subject to gasoline hydrocracking further comprises light-distillate. More preferably, the hydrocarbon feed that is subjected to gasoline hydrocracking preferably does not comprise more than 1 wt-% of hydrocarbons having more than one aromatic ring. Preferably, the gasoline hydrocracking conditions include a temperature of 300-580 °C, more preferably of 400-580 °C and even more preferably of 430-530 °C. Lower temperatures must be avoided since hydrogenation of the aromatic ring becomes favourable, unless a specifically adapted hydrocracking catalyst is employed. For instance, in case the catalyst comprises a further element that reduces the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst, such as tin, lead or bismuth, lower temperatures may be selected for gasoline hydrocracking; see e.g. WO 02/44306 A1 and WO 2007/ 055488. I n case the reaction temperature is too high, the yield of LPG's (especially propane and butanes) declines and the yield of methane rises. As the catalyst activity may decline over the lifetime of the catalyst, it is advantageous to increase the reactor temperature gradually over the life time of the catalyst to maintain the hydrocracking conversion rate. This means that the optimum temperature at the start of an operating cycle preferably is at the lower end of the hydrocracking temperature range. The optimum reactor temperature will rise as the catalyst deactivates so that at the end of a cycle (shortly before the catalyst is replaced or regenerated) the temperature preferably is selected at the higher end of the hydrocracking temperature range. Preferably, the gasoline hydrocracking of a hydrocarbon feedstream is performed at a pressure of 0.3-5 MPa gauge, more preferably at a pressure of 0.6-3 MPa gauge, particularly preferably at a pressure of 1 -2 MPa gauge and most preferably at a pressure of 1.2-1.6 MPa gauge. By increasing reactor pressure, conversion of C5+ non-aromatics can be increased, but this also increases the yield of methane and the hydrogenation of aromatic rings to cyclohexane species which can be cracked to LPG species. This results in a reduction in aromatic yield as the pressure is increased and, as some cyclohexane and its isomer m ethylcyclopentane, are not fully hydrocracked, there is an optimum in the purity of the resultant benzene at a pressure of 1.2-1.6 MPa. Preferably, gasoline hydrocracking of a hydrocarbon feedstream is performed at a Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) of 0.1 -20 h"1, more preferably at a Weight Hourly Space Velocity of 0.2-15 h 1 and m ost preferably at a Weight Hourly Space Velocity of 0.4-10 h 1. When the space velocity is too high, not all BTX co-boiling paraffin components are hydrocracked, so it will not be possible to achieve BTX specification by simple distillation of the reactor product. At too low space velocity the yield of methane rises at the expense of propane and butane. By selecting the optimal Weight Hourly Space Velocity, it was surprisingly found that sufficiently complete reaction of the benzene co-boilers is achieved to produce on spec BTX without the need for a liquid recycle. Preferably, the hydrocracking comprises contacting the catalytic cracking gasoline and preferably the light-distillate in the presence of hydrogen with a hydrocracking catalyst under hydrocracking conditions, wherein the hydrocracking catalyst comprises 0.1-1 wt-% hydrogenation metal in relation to the total catalyst weight and a zeolite having a pore size of 5-8 A and a silica (S1O2) to alumina (AI2O3) molar ratio of 5-200 and wherein the hydrocracking conditions comprise a temperature of 400-580 °C, a pressure of 300-5000 kPa gauge and a Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) of 0.1-20 h 1.

One advantage of selecting this specific hydrocracking catalyst as described herein above is that no desulphurization of the feed to the hydrocracking is required. Accordingly, preferred gasoline hydrocracking conditions thus include a temperature of 400-580 °C, a pressure of 0.3-5 MPa gauge and a Weight Hourly Space Velocity of 0.1-20 h 1.

Preferably, the aromatic ring opening and preferably the hydrocracking further produce LPG and wherein said LPG is subjected to aromatization to produce BTX. The process of the present invention may involve aromatization, which comprises contacting the LPG with an aromatization catalyst under aromatization conditions. The process conditions useful for aromatization, also described herein as "aromatization conditions", can be easily determined by the person skilled in the art; see Encyclopaedia of Hydrocarbons (2006) Vol II, Chapter 10.6, p. 591-614. The term "aromatization" is used herein in its generally accepted sense and thus may be defined as a process to convert aliphatic hydrocarbons to aromatic hydrocarbons. There are many aromatization technologies described in the prior art using C3-C8 aliphatic hydrocarbons as raw material; see e.g. US 4,056,575; US 4,157,356; US 4,180,689; Micropor. Mesopor. Mater 21, 439; WO 2004/013095 A2 and WO 2005/ 08515 A1. Accordingly, the aromatization catalyst may comprise a zeolite, preferably selected from the group consisting of ZSM-5 and zeolite L and may further comprising one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Ga, Zn, Ge and Pt. In case the feed mainly comprises C3-C5 aliphatic hydrocarbons, an acidic zeolite is preferred. As used herein, the term "acidic zeolite" relates to a zeolite in its default, protonic form. In case the feed mainly comprises C6-C8 hydrocarbons a non-acidic zeolite preferred. As used herein, the term "non-acidic zeolite" relates to a zeolite that is base-exchanged, preferably with an alkali metal or alkaline earth metals such as cesium, potassium, sodium, rubidium, barium, calcium, magnesium and mixtures thereof, to reduce acidity. Base-exchange may take place during synthesis of the zeolite with an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal being added as a component of the reaction mixture or may take place with a crystalline zeolite before or after deposition of a noble metal. The zeolite is base-exchanged to the extent that most or all of the cations associated with aluminum are alkali metal or alkaline earth metal. An example of a monovalent base:aluminum molar ratio in the zeolite after base exchange is at least about 0.9. Preferably, the catalyst is selected from the group consisting of HZSM-5 (wherein HZSM-5 describes ZSM-5 in its protonic form), Ga/HZSM-5, Zn/HZSM-5 and Pt/GeHZSM-5. The aromatization conditions may comprise a temperature of 450-550 °C, preferably 480-520 °C a pressure of 100-1000 kPa gauge, preferably 200-500 kPa gauge, and a Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) of 0.1-20 rr1, preferably of 0.4-4 rr1.

Preferably, the catalytic cracking further produces LPG and wherein said LPG produced by catalytic cracking is subjected to aromatization to produce BTX. Preferably, only part of the LPG produced in the process of the present invention (e.g. produced by one or more selected from the group consisting of aromatic ring opening, hydrocracking and catalytic cracking) is subjected to aromatization to produce BTX. The part of the LPG that is not subjected to aromatization may be subjected to olefins synthesis, e.g. by subjecting to pyrolysis or, preferably, to dehydrogenation. Preferably, propylene and/or butylenes are separated from the LPG produced by catalytic cracking before subjecting to aromatization. Means and methods for separating propylene and/or butylenes from mixed C2-C4 hydrocarbon streams are well known in the art and may involve distillation and/or extraction; see Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol. 6, Chapter "Butadiene", 388-390 and Vol. 13, Chapter "Ethylene", p. 512. Preferably, some or all of the C2 hydrocarbons are separated from LPG produced in the process of the present invention before subjecting said LPG to aromatization. Preferably, LPG produced by hydrocracking and aromatic ring opening is subjected to a first aromatization that is optimized towards aromatization of paraffinic hydrocarbons. Preferably, said first aromatization preferably comprises the aromatization conditions comprising a temperature of 400-600 °C, preferably 450- 550 °C, more preferably 480-520 °C, a pressure of 100-1000 kPa gauge, preferably 200-500 kPa gauge, and a Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) of 0.1-7 rr1, preferably of 0.4-2 h 1. Preferably the LPG produced by catalytic cracking is subjected to a second aromatization that is optimized towards aromatization of olefinic hydrocarbons. Preferably, said second aromatization preferably comprises the aromatization conditions comprising a temperature of 400-600 °C, preferably 450-550 °C, more preferably 480-520 °C, a pressure of 100-1000 kPa gauge, preferably 200-700 kPa gauge, and a Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) of 1 -20 h 1, preferably of 2-4 h 1. It was found that the aromatic hydrocarbon product made from olefinic feeds may comprise less benzene and more xylenes and C9+ aromatics than the liquid product resulting from paraffinic feeds. A similar effect may be observed when the process pressure is increased. It was found that olefinic aromatization feeds are suitable for higher pressure operation when compared to an aromatization process using paraffinic hydrocarbon feeds, which results in a higher conversion. With respect to paraffinic feed and low pressure process, the detrimental effect of pressure on aromatics selectivity may be offset by the improved aromatic selectivities for olefinic aromatization feeds. Preferably, one or more of the group consisting of the aromatic ring opening, the hydrocracking and the aromatization further produce methane and wherein said methane is used as fuel gas to provide process heat. Preferably, said fuel gas may be used to provide process heat to the hydrocracking, aromatic ring opening and/or aromatization. Preferably, the arom atization further produces hydrogen and wherein said hydrogen is used in the hydrocracking and/or aromatic ring opening.

However, it is also to be understood that a description on a product comprising certain com ponents also discloses a product consisting of these components. Sim ilarly, it is also to be understood that a description on a process comprising certain steps also discloses a process consisting of these steps. The present invention will now be m ore fully described by the following non-limiting Examples. Exam pie 1 The experimental data as provided herein were obtained by flowsheet modelling in Aspen Plus. For the fluid catalytic cracker, product yields and compositions are based on experimental data obtained from literature. For the aromatic ring opening followed by gasoline hydrocracking a reaction scheme has been used in which all multi aromatic compounds were converted into BTX and LPG and all naphthenic and paraffinic compounds were converted to LPG. In Example 1, hydrotreated vacuum gas oil (VGO) originating from Daqing crude oil is sent to the high severity catalytic cracking unit. This unit produces a gaseous stream, a light-distillate cut, a middle-distillate cut and coke. The light-distillate cut (properties shown in Table 1 ) is further upgraded in the gasoline hydrocracker into a BTXE-rich stream and a non-aromatic stream. The middle-distillate also referred as "light cycle oil" is upgraded in the aromatic ring opening unit under conditions keeping 1 aromatic ring intact. The aromatic-rich product obtained in the latter unit is sent to the gasoline hydrocracker to improve the purity of the BTXE contained in that stream. The results are provided in Table 2 as provided herein below. The products that are generated are divided into petrochemicals (olefins and BTXE, which is an acronym for BTX + ethylbenzene) and other products (hydrogen, methane and heavy fractions comprising C9 and heavier aromatic compounds). I n overall terms, there is a shortage of hydrogen of 1.3 wt-% of total feed. For Example 1 the BTXE yield is 16.4 wt-% of the total feed. Exam pie 2 Example 2 is identical to Example 1 except for the following: An aromatization process is treating the C3 and C4 hydrocarbons generated by the catalytic cracking unit, the gasoline hydrocracking unit and the aromatic ring opening unit. Different yield patterns due to variations in feedstock composition (e.g. olefinic content) were obtained from literature and applied in the model to determine the battery-limit product slate (Table 2). The hydrogen generated by the aromatization unit (hydrogen-producing unit) can be subsequently used in the hydrogen-consuming units (gasoline hydrocracker and aromatic ring opening unit). A remarkable increase in BTXE yield is obtained with a simultaneous increase in the hydrogen production. In overall terms, there is a small surplus of hydrogen of 0.3 wt-% of total feed. For Example 2 the BTXE yield is 46.5 wt-% of the total feed. Exam pie 3 Example 3 is identical to the Example 1 except for the following: Light Virgin Naphtha is used as feedstock for the catalytic cracking process. Product yields and compositions using this feed are based on experimental data obtained from literature. The use of lighter feedstock avoids the production of middle- distillates and thus, the necessity of an aromatic ring opening unit to process that fraction. In addition, there is a dramatic increase in the hydrogen being produced compared to the case where VGO is used (overall hydrogen surplus of 0.6 wt-% of the total feed compared to a shortage of 1.3 wt-% of total feed in Example 1 ). The battery-limit product yields are provided in table 2 as provided herein below. For Example 3 the BTXE yield is 16.0 wt-% of the total feed. Exam pie 4 Example 4 is identical to the Example 2 except for the following: The same feedstock (Light Virgin Naphtha) has been used as for example 3. Thus, aromatic ring opening unit is not required in this case. In overall terms, this is the case with the largest hydrogen surplus: 1.7 wt-% of the total feed. For Example 4 the BTXE yield is 35.9 wt-% of the total feed. Table 1.
