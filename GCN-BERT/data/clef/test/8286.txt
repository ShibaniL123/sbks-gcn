METHODS OF PROCUCING 6-CARBON CHEMICALS FROM LONG CHAIN FATTY ACIDS VIA OXIDATIVE CLEAVAGE CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/992,794, filed May 13, 2014, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD Disclosed herein are methods for biosynthesizing adipyl-[acp] and hexanoic acid from dodecanoyl-[acp] and methods for biosynthesizing adipyl-[acp] from octanoyl-[acp]. The products are biosynthesized using a polypeptide having pimeloyl- facpj synthase activity and, for example, a polypeptide having aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, such as in recombinant host cells expressing one or more such polypeptides. Further disclosed herein are methods for converting adipyl-[acp] and/or hexanoic acid to a C6 monomer such as adipic acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid, hexamethylenediamine, 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid, caprolactam, or 1,6-hexanediol (hereafter "C6 building blocks") using one or more isolated polypeptides having dehydrogenase, reductase, monooxygenase, transaminase, N-acetyltransferase, deacylase, or thioesterase activity or using recombinant host cells expressing one or more such polypeptides. BACKGROUND Nylons are polyamides which are sometimes synthesized by the condensation polymerisation of a diamine with a dicarboxylic acid. Similarly, nylons may be produced by the condensation polymerisation of lactams. A ubiquitous nylon is nylon 6,6, which is produced by reaction of hexamethylenediamine (HMD) and adipic acid. Nylon 6 is produced by a ring opening polymerisation of caprolactam. Therefore, adipic acid, hexamethylenediamine and caprolactam are important intermediates in the production of nylons (Anton & Baird, Polyamides Fibers, Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, 2001). Industrially, adipic acid and caprolactam are produced via air oxidation of cyclohexane. The air oxidation of cyclohexane produces, in a series of steps, a mixture of cyclohexanone (K) and cyclohexanol (A), designated as KA oil. Nitric acid oxidation of KA oil produces adipic acid (Musser, Adipic acid, Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000). Caprolactam is produced from cyclohexanone via its oxime and subsequent acid rearrangement (Fuchs, Kieczka and Moran, Caprolactam, Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000) Industrially, hexamethylenediamine (HMD) is produced by hydrocyanation of a C6 building block to adiponitrile, followed by hydrogenation to HMD (Herzog and Smiley, Hexamethylenediamine, Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2012). Given a reliance on petrochemical feedstocks, biotechnology offers an alternative approach via biocatalysis. Biocatalysis is the use of biological catalysts such as enzymes, to perform biochemical transformations of organic compounds. Both bioderived feedstocks and petrochemical feedstocks are viable starting materials for biocatalysis processes. Accordingly, against this background, it is clear that there is a need for sustainable methods for producing adipic acid, caprolactam, 6-aminohexanoic acid, hexamethylenediamine and 1,6-hexanediol (hereafter "C6 Building Blocks") wherein the methods are biocatalyst-based (Jang et al, Biotechnology & Bioengineering, 2012, 109(10), 2437 - 2459). However, no wild-type prokaryote or eukaryote naturally overproduces or excretes C6 building blocks to the extracellular environment. Nevertheless, the metabolism of adipic acid and caprolactam has been reported (Ramsay et al, Appl. Environ. Microbiol, 1986, 52(1), 152 - 156; Kulkarni and Kanekar, Current Microbiology, 1998, 37, 191 - 194). The dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, is converted efficiently as a carbon source by a number of bacteria and yeasts via β-oxidation into central metabolites, β- oxidation of adipate to 3-oxoadipate faciliates further catabolism via, for example, the ortho-cleavage pathway associated with aromatic substrate degradation. The catabolism of 3-oxoadipyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA by several bacteria and fungi has been characterized comprehensively (Harwood and Parales, Annual Review of Microbiology, 1996, 50, 553 - 590). Both adipate and 6-aminohexanoic acid are intermediates in the catabolism of caprolactam, finally degraded via 3- oxoadipyl-CoA to central metabolites. Potential metabolic pathways have been suggested for producing adipic acid from biomass-sugar: (1) biochemically from glucose to cis,cis muconic acid via the ortho-cleavage aromatic degradation pathway, followed by chemical catalysis to adipic acid; (2) a reversible adipic acid degradation pathway via the condensation of succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA and (3) combining β-oxidation, a fatty acid synthase and ω-oxidation. However, no information using these strategies has been reported (Jang et ah, Biotechnology & Bioengineering, 2012, 109(10), 2437 - 2459). An optimality principle states that microorganisms regulate their biochemical networks to support maximum biomass growth. Beyond the need for expressing heterologous pathways in a host organism, directing carbon flux towards C6 building blocks that serve as carbon sources rather than as biomass growth constituents, contradicts the optimality principle. For example, transferring the 1-butanol pathway from Clostridium species into other production strains has often fallen short by an order of magnitude compared to the production performance of native producers (Shen et al, Appl. Environ. Microbiol, 201 1, 77(9), 2905 - 2915). The efficient synthesis of a six carbon aliphatic backbone as central precursor is a key consideration in synthesizing C6 building blocks prior to forming terminal functional groups, such as carboxyl, amine or hydroxyl groups, on the C6 aliphatic backbone. SUMMARY This document is based at least in part on the discovery that it is possible to construct biochemical pathways for producing a six carbon chain aliphatic backbone precursor, in which one or two functional groups, i.e., carboxyl, amine or hydroxyl, can be formed, leading to the synthesis of one or more of adipic acid, 6- aminohexanoic acid, hexamethylenediamine, 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid, caprolactam, or 1,6-hexanediol (hereafter "C6 building blocks"). Adipic acid and adipate, acetic acid and acetate, 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid and 6-hydroxyhexanoate, and 6- aminohexanoic acid and 6-aminohexanoate are used interchangeably herein to refer to the compound in any of its neutral or ionized forms, including any salt forms thereof. It is understood by those skilled in the art that the specific form will depend on pH. These pathways, metabolic engineering, and cultivation strategies described herein rely on fatty acid synthesis enzymes or analog enzymes and a polypeptide having the ability to accept a C8 or C12 acyl-[acp] substrate and oxidatively cleave the C-C bond between the C6 and C7 carbons of the substrate to produce 6-oxohexanoyl-[acp] and acetaldehyde when octanoyl-[acp] is the substrate or 6-oxohexanoyl-[acp] and hexanal when dodecanoyl-[acp] is the substrate. A polypeptide having the ability to accept a C8 or C12 acyl-[acp] substrate and oxidatively cleave the C-C bond between the C6 and C7 carbons of the substrate (referred to as a pimeloyl-facpj synthase herein) can have at least 70% sequence identity to the wild type pimeloyl-facpj synthase encoded by biol from Bacillus subtilis The wild type pimeloyl-facpj synthase typically oxidatively cleaves the C-C bond between the C7 and C8 carbons of the acyl-[acp] substrate. In the face of the optimality principle, it surprisingly has been discovered that appropriate non-natural pathways, feedstocks, host microorganisms, attenuation strategies to the host's biochemical network and cultivation strategies may be combined to produce C6 building blocks efficiently. In some embodiments, the C6 aliphatic backbone for conversion to a C6 building block can be formed from dodecanoyl-[acp] or octanoyl-[acp] that is produced in fatty acid synthesis. See FIG. 1. In some embodiments, a terminal carboxyl group can be enzymatically formed using a polypeptide having thioesterase activity or a polypeptide having aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. See FIG. 2. In some embodiments, a terminal amine group can be enzymatically formed using a polypeptide having ω-transaminase activity or a polypeptide having diamine transaminase activity. See FIG. 3, FIG. 4, FIG. 5, and FIG. 6. The amide bond associated with caprolactam is the result of first having a terminal carboxyl group and terminal amine group on the linear carbon chain to form the bond. In some embodiments, a terminal hydroxyl group can be enzymatically formed using a polypeptide having alkane 1-monooxygenase activity or a polypeptide having alcohol dehydrogenase activity See FIG. 7 and FIG. 8.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Described herein are enzymes, non-natural pathways, cultivation strategies, feedstocks, host microorganisms and attenuations to the host's biochemical network, which generates a six carbon chain aliphatic backbone from central metabolites in which one or two terminal functional groups may be formed leading to the synthesis of adipic acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid, 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid, hexamethylenediamine, caprolactam, or 1 ,6-hexanediol (referred to as "C6 building blocks" herein). As used herein, the term "central precursor" is used to denote any metabolite in any metabolic pathway shown herein leading to the synthesis of a C6 building block. The term "central metabolite" is used herein to denote a metabolite that is produced in microorganisms to support growth. Host microorganisms described herein can include endogenous pathways that can be manipulated such that one or more C6 building blocks can be produced. In an endogenous pathway, the host microorganism naturally expresses all of the enzymes catalysing the reactions within the pathway. A host microorganism containing an engineered pathway does not naturally express all of the enzymes catalyzing the reactions within the pathway but has been engineered such that all of the enzymes within the pathway are expressed in the host. The term "exogenous" as used herein with reference to a nucleic acid (or a protein) and a host refers to a nucleic acid that does not occur in (and cannot be obtained from) a cell of that particular type as it is found in nature or a protein encoded by such a nucleic acid. Thus, a non-naturally-occurring nucleic acid is considered to be exogenous to a host once in the host. It is important to note that non- naturally-occurring nucleic acids can contain nucleic acid subsequences or fragments of nucleic acid sequences that are found in nature provided the nucleic acid as a whole does not exist in nature. For example, a nucleic acid molecule containing a genomic DNA sequence within an expression vector is non-naturally-occurring nucleic acid, and thus is exogenous to a host cell once introduced into the host, since that nucleic acid molecule as a whole (genomic DNA plus vector DNA) does not exist in nature. Thus, any vector, autonomously replicating plasmid, or virus (e.g., retrovirus, adenovirus, or herpes virus) that as a whole does not exist in nature is considered to be non-naturally-occurring nucleic acid. It follows that genomic DNA fragments produced by PCR or restriction endonuclease treatment as well as cDNAs are considered to be non-naturally-occurring nucleic acid since they exist as separate molecules not found in nature. It also follows that any nucleic acid containing a promoter sequence and polypeptide-encoding sequence (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) in an arrangement not found in nature is non-naturally-occurring nucleic acid. A nucleic acid that is naturally-occurring can be exogenous to a particular host microorganism. For example, an entire chromosome isolated from a cell of yeast x is an exogenous nucleic acid with respect to a cell of yeast y once that chromosome is introduced into a cell of yeast y. In contrast, the term "endogenous" as used herein with reference to a nucleic acid (e.g., a gene) (or a protein) and a host refers to a nucleic acid (or protein) that does occur in (and can be obtained from) that particular host as it is found in nature. Moreover, a cell "endogenously expressing" a nucleic acid (or protein) expresses that nucleic acid (or protein) as does a host of the same particular type as it is found in nature. Moreover, a host "endogenously producing" or that "endogenously produces" a nucleic acid, protein, or other compound produces that nucleic acid, protein, or compound as does a host of the same particular type as it is found in nature. For example, depending on the host and the compounds produced by the host, one or more of the following polypeptides may be expressed in the host in addition to a polypeptide having pimeloyl-facp] synthase activity: a polypeptide having aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, a polypeptide having alkane 1-monooxygenase activity, a polypeptide having thioesterase activity, a polypeptide having ω-transaminase activity, a polypeptide having carboxylate reductase activity, a polypeptide having hydrolase activity, a polypeptide having diamine transaminase activity, a polypeptide having N- acetyltransferase activity, a polypeptide having lysine N-acetyltransferase activity, a polypeptide having deacylase activity, or a polypeptide having alcohol dehydrogenase activity. In recombinant hosts expressing a polypeptide having carboxylate reductase activity, a polypeptide having phosphopantetheinyl transferase activity also can be expressed as it enhances activity of the carboxylate reductase activity. In recombinant hosts expressing a polypeptide having monooxygenase activity, an electron transfer chain protein such as a polypeptide having oxidoreductase activity or a ferredoxin polypeptide also can be expressed. For example, a recombinant host can include an exogenous polypeptide having pimeloyl-facp] synthase activity and produce 6-oxohexanoyl-[acp] and either hexanal or acetaldehyde, depending if dodecanoyl-[acp] or octanoyl-[acp] is the substrate for the polypeptide having pimeloyl-facp] synthase activity. For example, a recombinant host can include an exogenous polypeptide having pimeloyl-facp] synthase activity and an exogenous polypeptide having aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and produce (i) adipyl-[acp] and hexanoic acid or (ii) adipyl-[acp] and acetic acid, depending if dodecanoyl-[acp] or octanoyl-[acp] is the substrate for the polypeptide having pimeloyl-facp] synthase activity. In embodiments in which dodecanoyl-[acp] is the substrate for the polypeptide having pimeloyl-facp] synthase activity in the recombinant host, adipyl-[acp] and hexanoic acid can be produced. In embodiments in which octanoyl-[acp] is the substrate for the polypeptide having pimeloyl-facp] synthase activity in the recombinant host, adipyl- [acp] and acetic acid can be produced. For example, a recombinant host can include an exogenous polypeptide having pimeloyl-facp] synthase activity, an exogenous polypeptide having aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, and an exogenous polypeptide having thioesterase activity, and produce adipic acid. See, e.g., FIG. 2. For example, a recombinant host can include an exogenous polypeptide having pimeloyl-facp] synthase activity, an exogenous polypeptide having aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, and at least one polypeptide selected from the group consisting of (i) an exogenous polypeptide having alkane 1-monooxygenase activity, (ii) an exogenous polypeptide having alcohol dehydrogenase activity and (iii) a polypeptide having aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and produce adipic acid. In some embodiments, the host includes two or more exogenous polypeptides having different aldehyde dehydrogenase activities. See, e.g., FIG. 2. For example, a recombinant host can include an exogenous polypeptide having pimeloyl-facp] synthase activity, an exogenous polypeptide having aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, and at least one polypeptide selected from the group of (i) an exogenous polypeptide having alkane 1-monooxygenase activity, (ii) an exogenous polypeptide having alcohol dehydrogenase activity, (iii) an exogenous polypeptide having thioesterase activity and produce adipic acid.

For example, a polypeptide having pimeloyl-facpj synthase activity described herein can have at least 70% sequence identity (homology) (e.g., at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100%) to the amino acid sequence of a Bacillus subtilis pimeloyl-facpj synthase (see Genbank Accession No. AAB 17462.1, SEQ ID NO:23). See, FIG. 21. The percent identity (homology) between two amino acid sequences can be determined as follows. First, the amino acid sequences are aligned using the BLAST 2 Sequences (B12seq) program from the stand-alone version of BLASTZ containing BLASTP version 2.0.14. This stand-alone version of BLASTZ can be obtained from Fish & Richardson's web site (e.g., www.fr.com/blast/) or the U.S. government's National Center for Biotechnology Information web site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Instructions explaining how to use the B12seq program can be found in the readme file accompanying BLASTZ. B12seq performs a comparison between two amino acid sequences using the BLASTP algorithm. To compare two amino acid sequences, the options of B12seq are set as follows: -i is set to a file containing the first amino acid sequence to be compared (e.g., C:\seql.txt); -j is set to a file containing the second amino acid sequence to be compared (e.g., C:\seq2.txt); -p is set to blastp; -o is set to any desired file name (e.g., C:\output.txt); and all other options are left at their default setting. For example, the following command can be used to generate an output file containing a comparison between two amino acid sequences: C:\B12seq -i c:\seql.txt -j c:\seq2.txt -p blastp -o c:\output.txt. If the two compared sequences share homology (identity), then the designated output file will present those regions of homology as aligned sequences. If the two compared sequences do not share homology (identity), then the designated output file will not present aligned sequences. Similar procedures can be following for nucleic acid sequences except that blastn is used. Once aligned, the number of matches is determined by counting the number of positions where an identical amino acid residue is presented in both sequences. The percent identity (homology) is determined by dividing the number of matches by the length of the full-length polypeptide amino acid sequence followed by multiplying the resulting value by 100. It is noted that the percent identity (homology) value is rounded to the nearest tenth. For example, 78.11, 78.12, 78.13, and 78.14 is rounded down to 78.1, while 78.15, 78.16, 78.17, 78.18, and 78.19 is rounded up to 78.2. It also is noted that the length value will always be an integer. It will be appreciated that a number of nucleic acids can encode a polypeptide having a particular amino acid sequence. The degeneracy of the genetic code is well known to the art; i.e., for many amino acids, there is more than one nucleotide triplet that serves as the codon for the amino acid. For example, codons in the coding sequence for a given enzyme can be modified such that optimal expression in a particular species (e.g., bacteria or fungus) is obtained, using appropriate codon bias tables for that species. Functional fragments of any of the enzymes described herein can also be used in the methods of the document. The term "functional fragment" as used herein refers to a peptide fragment of a protein that has at least 25% (e.g., at least: 30%; 40%; 50%; 60%; 70%; 75%; 80%; 85%; 90%; 95%; 98%; 99%; 100%; or even greater than 100%) of the activity of the corresponding mature, full-length, wild-type protein. The functional fragment can generally, but not always, be comprised of a continuous region of the protein, wherein the region has functional activity. This document also provides (i) functional variants of the enzymes used in the methods of the document and (ii) functional variants of the functional fragments described above. Functional variants of the enzymes and functional fragments can contain additions, deletions, or substitutions relative to the corresponding wild-type sequences. Enzymes with substitutions will generally have not more than 50 (e.g., not more than one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, or 50) amino acid substitutions (e.g., conservative substitutions). This applies to any of the enzymes described herein and functional fragments. A conservative substitution is a substitution of one amino acid for another with similar characteristics. Conservative substitutions include substitutions within the following groups: valine, alanine and glycine; leucine, valine, and isoleucine; aspartic acid and glutamic acid; asparagine and glutamine; serine, cysteine, and threonine; lysine and arginine; and phenylalanine and tyrosine. The nonpolar hydrophobic amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine. The polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine and glutamine. The positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine. The negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Any substitution of one member of the above- mentioned polar, basic or acidic groups by another member of the same group can be deemed a conservative substitution. By contrast, a nonconservative substitution is a substitution of one amino acid for another with dissimilar characteristics. Deletion variants can lack one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 amino acid segments (of two or more amino acids) or non-contiguous single amino acids. Additions (addition variants) include fusion proteins containing: (a) any of the enzymes described herein or a fragment thereof; and (b) internal or terminal (C or N) irrelevant or heterologous amino acid sequences. In the context of such fusion proteins, the term "heterologous amino acid sequences" refers to an amino acid sequence other than (a). A heterologous sequence can be, for example a sequence used for purification of the recombinant protein (e.g., FLAG, polyhistidine (e.g., hexahistidine), hemagglutinin (HA), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), or maltosebinding protein (MBP)). Heterologous sequences also can be proteins useful as detectable markers, for example, luciferase, green fluorescent protein (GFP), or chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT). In some embodiments, the fusion protein contains a signal sequence from another protein. In certain host cells (e.g., yeast host cells), expression and/or secretion of the target protein can be increased through use of a heterologous signal sequence. In some embodiments, the fusion protein can contain a carrier (e.g., KLH) useful, e.g., in eliciting an immune response for antibody generation) or ER or Golgi apparatus retention signals. Heterologous sequences can be of varying length and in some cases can be a longer sequences than the full-length target proteins to which the heterologous sequences are attached. In some embodiments, the oxidative cleavage of dodecanoyl-[acp] or octanoyl-[acp] into one or more C6 aliphatic backbones is achieved by protein engineering of the acyl carrier protein in the particular host, establishing substrate alignment of the carbon-6 and carbon-7 positions within the pimeloyl-facpj synthase encoded by Biol. In some embodiments, the oxidative cleavage of dodecanoyl-[acp] or octanoyl-[acp] into one or more C6 aliphatic backbones is achieved by synthesizing a modified phosphopantetheine linker between the acyl carrier protein and the fatty acid in the particular host, establishing substrate alignment of the carbon-6 and carbon-7 positions within the pimeloyl-facpj synthase encoded by Biol. In some embodiments, the oxidative cleavage of dodecanoyl-[acp] or octanoyl-[acp] into one or more C6 aliphatic backbones is achieved by enzyme engineering of the pimeloyl-facpj synthase (SEQ ID NO: 23) encoded by Biol, establishing substrate alignment of the carbon-6 and carbon-7 positions within the enzyme for oxidative cleavage. The reactions of the pathways described herein can be performed in one or more host strains (a) naturally expressing one or more relevant enzymes, (b) genetically engineered to express one or more relevant enzymes, or (c) naturally expressing one or more relevant enzymes and genetically engineered to express one or more relevant enzymes. Alternatively, relevant enzymes can be extracted from of the above types of host cells and used in a purified or semi-purified form. Moreover, such extracts include lysates (e.g. cell lysates) that can be used as sources of relevant enzymes. In the methods provided by the document, all the steps can be performed in host cells, all the steps can be performed using extracted enzymes, or some of the steps can be performed in cells and others can be performed using extracted enzymes. As described herein recombinant hosts can include nucleic acids encoding one or more of a polypeptide having synthase activity, a polypeptide having dehydrogenase activity, a polypeptide having reductase activity, a polypeptide having monooxygenase activity, a polypeptide having thioesterase activity, a polypeptide having deacylase activity, a polypeptide having transferase activity, or a polypeptide having transaminase activityas described in more detail below. In addition, the production of one or more C6 building blocks can be performed in vitro using the isolated enzymes described herein, using a lysate (e.g., a cell lysate) from a host microorganism as a source of the enzymes, or using a plurality of lysates from different host microorganisms as the source of the enzymes. Enzymes generating the C6 aliphatic backbone for conversion to C6 Building Blocks The C6 aliphatic backbone for conversion to one or more C6 building blocks can be formed from fatty acid biosynthesis using acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA as central metabolites and a polypeptide having pimeioyi-facpj synthase activityfor oxidative cleavage of a dodecanoyl-[acp] or octanoyl-[acp] precursor. Suitable pimeloyl-facpj synthases have the ability to accept a C8 or C12 acyl-[acp] substrate and oxidatively cleave the C-C bond between the C6 and C7 carbons of the substrate to produce 6-oxohexanoyl-[acp] and acetaldehyde when octanoyl-[acp] is the substrate or 6-oxohexanoyl-[acp] and hexanal when dodecanoyl-[acp] is the substrate, and can have at least 70% sequence identity to the wild type pimeloyl-facpj synthase encoded by biol from Bacillus subtilis The wild type pimeloyl-facpj synthase is classified under EC 1.14.15.12 and typically oxidatively cleaves the C-C bond between the C7 and C8 carbons of the acyl-[acp] substrate. See Green et al, J. Biol. Inorg. Chem., 2001, 6, 523- 533; Cryle and De Voss, Chem. Commun. (Camb.), 2004, 7, 86-87; Cryle and Schlichting, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2008, 105, 15696 - 15701. In some embodiments, the semialdehyde products produced from a polypeptide having pimeloyl-facpj synthase activity (e.g., having 70% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 23) are converted to their respective carboxylic acids by a polypeptide having aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. See FIG. 1. In some embodiments, the aldehyde dehydrogenase is classified under EC 1.2.1.3 or EC 1.2.1.4. See FIG. 1. Enzymes generating the terminal carboxyl groups in the biosynthesis of C6 Building Blocks As depicted in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the terminal carboxyl groups can be enzymatically formed using a polypeptide having thioesterase activity or a polypeptide having aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. In some embodiments, the first or second terminal carboxyl group leading to the synthesis of a C6 building block is enzymatically formed by an aldehyde dehydrogenase classified under EC 1.2.1.- (e.g., EC 1.2.1.3, EC 1.2.1.4, EC 1.2.1.16, EC 1.2.1.20, EC 1.2.1.63, or EC 1.2.1.79). For example, a first terminal carboxyl group can be enzymatically formed by an aldehyde dehydrogenase classified under EC 1.2.1.4 (Ho & Weiner, Journal of Bacteriology, 2005, 187(3), 1067 - 1073) or classified EC 1.2.1.3 (Guerrillot & Vandecasteele, Eur. J. Biochem., 1977, 81, 185— 192). For example, a second terminal carboxyl group leading to the synthesis of adipic acid can be enzymatically formed by an aldehyde dehydrogenase classified under EC 1.2.1.- (e.g., EC 1.2.1.3, EC 1.2.1.16, EC 1.2.1.20, EC 1.2.1.63, or EC 1.2.1.79), such as the gene product oi CpnE, ChnE, or ThnG (see, e.g., Iwaki et ah, Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 1999, 65(1 1), 5158 - 5162; or Lopez-Sanchez et αί, Αρρί Environ. Microbiol., 2010, 76(1), 110 - 1 18). The gene product of ThnG is a 7- oxoheptanoate dehydrogenase. The gene product of ChnE is a 6-oxohexanoate dehydrogenase. In some embodiments, the second terminal carboxyl group leading to the synthesis of adipic acid is enzymatically formed by a thioesterase classified under EC 3.1.2.-, such as the gene product oifatB, tesA, or the thioesterases having the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2 (see, e.g., Jing et ah, BMC Biochemistry, 201 1, 12, 44; Cantu et al, Protein Science, 2010, 19, 1281 - 1295; Zhuang et al, Biochemistry, 2008, 47(9), 2789 - 2796; or Naggert et al, J. Biol Chem., 1991, 266(17), 1 1044 - 11050). Enzymes generating the terminal amine groups in the biosynthesis of C6 Building Blocks As depicted in FIG. 3, FIG. 4, FIG. 5, and FIG. 6, a terminal amine group can be enzymatically formed using a polypeptide having ω-transaminase activity or a polypeptide having deacylase activity. In some embodiments, a terminal amine group can be enzymatically formed by a ω-transaminase classified, for example, under EC 2.6.1.-, e.g., EC 2.6.1.18, EC 2.6.1.19, EC 2.6.1.29, EC 2.6.1.48, or EC 2.6.1.82 such as that obtained from Chromobacterium violaceum (Genbank Accession No. AAQ59697.1, SEQ ID NO: 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Genbank Accession No. AAG08191.1, SEQ ID NO: 9), Pseudomonas syringae (Genbank Accession No. AAY39893.1, SEQ ID NO: 10), Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Genbank Accession No. ABA81 135.1, SEQ ID NO: 11), Vibrio fluvialis (Genbank Accession No. AEA39183.1, SEQ ID NO: 13), Streptomyces griseus, or Clostridium viride. See, FIG. 3. An additional ω-transaminase that can be used in the methods and hosts described herein is from Escherichia coli (Genbank Accession No. AAA57874.1, SEQ ID NO: 12). Some of the ω-transaminases classified, for example, under EC 2.6.1.29 or EC 2.6.1.82 are diamine co-transaminases. In some embodiments, the first terminal amine group leading to the synthesis of 6-aminohexanoic acid is enzymatically formed by a ω-transaminase classified under EC 2.6.1.18, such as that obtained from Vibrio fluvialis (SEQ ID NO: 13) or Chromobacterium violaceum (SEQ ID NO: 8), classified under EC 2.6.1.19, such as that obtained from Streptomyces griseus, or classified under EC 2.6.1.48, such as that obtained from Clostridium viride. The ω-transaminases having the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 9, 10, and 1 1 also can be used. The reversible co-transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum has demonstrated analogous activity accepting 6-aminohexanoic acid as amino donor, thus forming the first terminal amine group in adipate semialdehyde (Kaulmann et al. , Enzyme and Microbial Technology, 2007, 41, 628 - 637). The reversible 4-aminobubyrate: 2-oxoglutarate transaminase from Streptomyces griseus has demonstrated analogous activity for the conversion of 6- aminohexanoic acid to adipate semialdehyde (Yonaha et al, Eur. J. Biochem., 1985, 146, 101 - 106). The reversible 5-aminovalerate transaminase from Clostridium viride has demonstrated analogous activity for the conversion of 6-aminohexanoic acid to adipate semialdehyde (Barker et αί, J. Biol. Chem., 1987, 262(19), 8994 - 9003). In some embodiments, the second terminal amine group leading to the synthesis of hexamethylenediamine is enzymatically formed by a diamine transaminase classified under EC 2.6.1.29 or classified under EC 2.6.1.82, such as the gene product of YgjG. The ω-transaminases having the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 8-13 can be used for biosynthesizing hexamethylenediamine. The gene product of ygjG accepts a broad range of diamine carbon chain length substrates, such as putrescine, cadaverine and spermidine (Samsonova et al, BMC Microbiology, 2003, 3 :2) The diamine transaminase from E.coli strain B has demonstrated activity for 1,6 diaminohexane (Kim, J. Chem., 1963, 239(3), 783 - 786). In some embodiments, the second terminal amine group leading to the synthesis of heptamethylenediamine is enzymatically formed in N6-acetyl-l,6- diaminohexane by a deacylase classified, for example, under EC 3.5.1.17 such as an acyl lysine deacylase. Enzymes generating the terminal hydroxyl groups in the biosynthesis of C6 Building Blocks As depicted in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, a terminal hydroxyl group can be enzymatically formed using a polypeptide having alkane 1-monooxygenase activity or a polypeptide having alcohol dehydrogenase activity. In some embodiments, the first terminal hydroxyl group leading to the synthesis of a C6 building block is enzymatically formed by an alkane 1- monooxygenase such as that encoded by alkBGT or a cytochrome P450 such as from the CYP153 family such as CYP153A (see, e.g., Van Beilen & Funhoff, Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 2005, 16, 308 - 314; Koch et al, Appl. Environ. Microbiol, 2009, 75(2), 337-344; or ieder and Shapiro, Journal of Bacteriology , 1975, 122(1), 93 - 98). See, e.g., SEQ ID NOs. 16-18. The substrate specificity of terminal alkane 1 -monooxygenase in the CYP153A family and alkB monooxygenase has been broadened successfully (Koch et ah, 2009, supra). Although non-terminal hydroxylation is observed in vitro for CYP153A6, in vivo only 1 -hydroxylation occurs (Funhoff et ah, Journal of Bacteriology, 2006, 188(14), 5220 - 5227). In some embodiments, a terminal hydroxyl group leading to the synthesis of 6- hydroxyhexanoic acid is enzymatically formed by an alcohol dehydrogenase classified under EC 1.1.1.- (e.g., EC 1.1.1.2) such as the gene product of YMR318C, cpnD or gabD, or classified under EC 1.1.1.258 such as the gene product of ChnD. The alcohol dehydrogenase classified under EC 1.1.1.258 is a 6-hydroxyhexanoate dehydrogenase. In some embodiments, the second terminal hydroxyl group leading to the synthesis of 1,6 hexanediol is enzymatically formed by an alcohol dehydrogenase classified under EC 1.1.1.- (e.g., EC 1.1.1.1, EC 1.1.1.2, EC 1.1.1.21, or EC 1.1.1.184) such as the gene product of YMR318C or YqhD or the protein having GenBank Accession No. CAA81612.1.

See FIG. 8. Cultivation strategy In some embodiments, one or more C6 building blocks are biosynthesized in a recombinant host using anaerobic, aerobic or micro-aerobic cultivation conditions. In some embodiments, the cultivation strategy entails nutrient limitation such as nitrogen, phosphate or oxygen limitation. In some embodiments, a cell retention strategy using, for example, ceramic membranes can be employed to achieve and maintain a high cell density during either fed-batch or continuous fermentation. In some embodiments, the principal carbon source fed to the fermentation in the synthesis of one or more C6 building blocks can derive from biological or non- biological feedstocks. In some embodiments, the biological feedstock can be or can derive from, monosaccharides, disaccharides, lignocellulose, hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, levulinic acid and formic acid, triglycerides, glycerol, fatty acids, agricultural waste, condensed distillers' solubles, or municipal waste. The efficient catabolism of crude glycerol stemming from the production of biodiesel has been demonstrated in several microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Cupriavidus necator, Pseudomonas oleavorans, Pseudomonas putida and Yarrowia lipolytica (Lee et ah, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol., 2012, 166: 1801 - 1813; Yang et al, Biotechnology for Biofuels, 2012, 5: 13; Meijnen et al, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol, 201 1, 90:885 - 893). The efficient catabolism of lignocellulosic-derived levulinic acid has been demonstrated in several organisms such as Cupriavidus necator and Pseudomonas putida in the synthesis of 3 -hydroxy valerate via the precursor propanoyl-CoA (Jaremko and Yu, 2011, supra; Martin and Prather, J. Biotechnol, 2009, 139:61 - 67). The efficient catabolism of lignin-derived aromatic compounds such as benzoate analogues has been demonstrated in several microorganisms such as Pseudomonas putida, Cupriavidus necator (Bugg et al. , Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 201 1, 22, 394 - 400; Perez-Pantoja et al, FEMS Microbiol. Rev., 2008, 32, 736 - 794). The efficient utilization of agricultural waste, such as olive mill waste water has been demonstrated in several microorganisms, including Yarrowia lipolytica (Papanikolaou et al, Bioresour. Technol, 2008, 99(7):2419 - 2428). The efficient utilization of fermentable sugars such as monosaccharides and disaccharides derived from cellulosic, hemicellulosic, cane and beet molasses, cassava, corn and other agricultural sources has been demonstrated for several microorganism such as Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum and Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactococcus lactis (see, e.g., Hermann et al, J. Biotechnol, 2003, 104: 155 - 172; Wee et al, Food Technol. Biotechnol, 2006, 44(2): 163 - 172; Ohashi et al, J. Bioscience and Bioengineering, 1999, 87(5):647 - 654). The efficient utilization of furfural, derived from a variety of agricultural lignocellulosic sources, has been demonstrated for Cupriavidus necator (Li et al, Biodegradation, 2011, 22: 1215 - 1225). In some embodiments, the non-biological feedstock can be or can derive from natural gas, syngas, CO2/H2, methanol, ethanol, benzoate, non-volatile residue (NVR) or a caustic wash waste stream from cyclohexane oxidation processes, or terephthalic acid / isophthalic acid mixture waste streams. The efficient catabolism of methanol has been demonstrated for the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastor is. The efficient catabolism of ethanol has been demonstrated for Clostridium kluyveri (Seedorf et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 2008, 105(6) 2128 - 2133). The efficient catabolism of CO2 and H2, which may be derived from natural gas and other chemical and petrochemical sources, has been demonstrated for Cupriavidus necator (Prybylski et al, Energy, Sustainability and Society, 2012, 2: 11). The efficient catabolism of syngas has been demonstrated for numerous microorganisms, such as Clostridium ljungdahlii and Clostridium autoethanogenum (K5pke et al, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 201 1, 77(15):5467 - 5475). The efficient catabolism of the non-volatile residue waste stream from cyclohexane processes has been demonstrated for numerous microorganisms, such as Delftia acidovorans and Cupriavidus necator (Ramsay et al, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 1986, 52(1): 152 - 156). In some embodiments, the host microorganism is a prokaryote. For example, the prokaryote can be a bacterium from the genus Escherichia such as Escherichia coli; from the genus Clostridia such as Clostridium ljungdahlii, Clostridium autoethanogenum or Clostridium kluyveri; from the genus Corynebacteria such as Corynebacterium glutamicum; from the genus Cupriavidus such as Cupriavidus necator or Cupriavidus metallidurans; from the genus Pseudomonas such as Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida or Pseudomonas oleavorans; from the genus Delftia such as Delftia acidovorans; from the genus Bacillus such as Bacillus subtillis; from the genus Lactobacillus such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii; or from the genus Lactococcus such as Lactococcus lactis. Such prokaryotes also can be a source of genes to construct recombinant host cells described herein that are capable of producing one or more C6 building blocks. In some embodiments, the host microorganism is a eukaryote. For example, the eukaryote can be a filamentous fungus, e.g., one from the genus Aspergillus such as Aspergillus niger. Alternatively, the eukaryote can be a yeast, e.g., one from the genus Saccharomyces such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae; from the genus Pichia such as Pichia pastoris; or from the genus Yarrowia such as Yarrowia lipolytica; from the genus Issatchenkia such as Issathenkia orientalis; from the genus Debaryomyces such as Debaryomyces hansenii; from the genus Arxula such as Arxula adenoinivorans; or from the genus Kluyveromyces such as Kluyveromyces lactis. Such eukaryotes also can be a source of genes to construct recombinant host cells described herein that are capable of producing one or more C6 building blocks. Metabolic engineering The present document provides methods involving less than all the steps described for all the above pathways. Such methods can involve, for example, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve or more of such steps. Where less than all the steps are included in such a method, the first, and in some embodiments the only, step can be any one of the steps listed. Furthermore, recombinant hosts described herein can include any combination of the above enzymes such that one or more of the steps, e.g., one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or more of such steps, can be performed within a recombinant host. This document provides host cells of any of the genera and species listed and genetically engineered to express one or more (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 or more) recombinant forms of any of the enzymes recited in the document. Thus, for example, the host cells can contain exogenous nucleic acids encoding enzymes catalyzing one or more of the steps of any of the pathways described herein. In addition, this document recognizes that where enzymes have been described as accepting CoA-activated substrates, analogous enzyme activities associated with [acp]-bound substrates exist that are not necessarily in the same enzyme class. Also, this document recognizes that where enzymes have been described accepting (R)-enantiomers of substrate, analogous enzyme activities associated with (S)-enantiomer substrates exist that are not necessarily in the same enzyme class. This document also recognizes that where an enzyme is shown to accept a particular co-factor, such as NADPH, or co-substrate, such as acetyl-CoA, many enzymes are promiscuous in terms of accepting a number of different co-factors or co-substrates in catalyzing a particular enzyme activity. Also, this document recognizes that where enzymes have high specificity for e.g., a particular co-factor such as NADH, an enzyme with similar or identical activity that has high specificity for the co-factor NADPH may be in a different enzyme class. In some embodiments, the enzymes in the pathways described herein are the result of enzyme engineering via non-direct or rational enzyme design approaches with aims of improving activity, improving specificity, reducing feedback inhibition, reducing repression, improving enzyme solubility, changing stereo-specificity, or changing co-factor specificity. In some embodiments, the enzymes in the pathways described herein are gene dosed (i.e., overexpressed by having a plurality of copies of the gene in the host organism), into the resulting genetically modified organism via episomal or chromosomal integration approaches. In some embodiments, genome-scale system biology techniques such as Flux Balance Analysis are utilized to devise genome scale attenuation or knockout strategies for directing carbon flux to a C6 building block. Attenuation strategies include, but are not limited to; the use of transposons, homologous recombination (double cross-over approach), mutagenesis, enzyme inhibitors and RNA interference (RNAi). In some embodiments, fluxomic, metabolomic and transcriptomal data are utilized to inform or support genome-scale system biology techniques, thereby devising genome scale attenuation or knockout strategies in directing carbon flux to a C6 building block. In some embodiments, the host microorganism's tolerance to high concentrations of a C6 building block is improved through continuous cultivation in a selective environment. In some embodiments, the host microorganism's endogenous biochemical network is attenuated or augmented to (1) ensure the intracellular availability of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, (2) create a NADPH imbalance that may only be balanced via fatty acid synthesis and the formation of a C6 building block, (3) prevent degradation of central metabolites or central precursors leading to and including C6 building blocks and (4) ensure efficient efflux from the cell. In some embodiments requiring the intracellular availability of acetyl-CoA for C6 building block synthesis, an endogenous phosphotransacetylase generating acetate such as pta is attenuated (Shen et al, Appl. Environ. Microbiol, 201 1, 77(9), 2905 - 2915). In some embodiments requiring the intracellular availability of acetyl-CoA for C6 building block synthesis, an endogenous gene encoding an acetate kinase in an acetate synthesis pathway, such as ack, is attenuated. In some embodiments requiring the intracellular availability of acetyl-CoA for C6 building block synthesis, an endogenous gene encoding an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of pyruvate to lactate such as IdhA is attenuated (Shen et al, Appl. Environ. Microbiol, 2011, 77(9), 2905 - 2915). In some embodiments requiring the intracellular availability of acetyl-CoA for C6 building block synthesis, endogenous genes encoding enzymes that catalyze the degradation of phosphoenolpyruvate to succinate such as frdBC are attenuated (see, e.g., Shen et al., 20\ \, supra). In some embodiments requiring the intracellular availability of acetyl-CoA for C6 building block synthesis, an endogenous gene encoding an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of acetyl-CoA to ethanol such as the alcohol dehydrogenase encoded by adhE is attenuated (Shen et al., 20\ \, supra). In some embodiments requiring the intracellular availability of acetyl-CoA for C6 building block synthesis, recombinant acetyl-CoA synthetase such as the gene product of acs is overexpressed in the microorganism (Satoh et al, Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering, 2003, 95(4), 335 - 341). In some embodiments, carbon flux is directed into the pentose phosphate cycle by attenuating an endogenous glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9). In some embodiments, where pathways require excess NADPH co-factor in the synthesis of a C6 building block, a recombinant puridine nucleotide transhydrogenase gene such as UdhA is overexpressed in the host organism (Brigham et al, Advanced Biofuels and Bioproducts, 2012, Chapter 39, 1065 - 1090). In some embodiments, where pathways require excess NADPH co-factor in the synthesis of a C6 building block, a recombinant glyceraldehyde-3P- dehydrogenase gene such as GapN is overexpressed in the host organism (Brigham et ah, 2012, supra). In some embodiments, where pathways require excess NADPH co-factor in the synthesis of a C6 building block, a recombinant malic enzyme gene such as maeA or maeB is overexpressed in the host (Brigham et al, 2012, supra). In some embodiments, where pathways require excess NADPH co-factor in the synthesis of a C6 building block, a recombinant glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene such as zwfis overexpressed in the host (Lim et al, Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering, 2002, 93(6), 543 - 549). In some embodiments, where pathways require excess NADPH co-factor in the synthesis of a C6 building block, a recombinant gene encoding fructose 1, 6 diphosphatase such as fbp is overexpressed in the host (Becker et al. , Journal of Biotechnology, 2007, 132, 99 - 109). In some embodiments, where pathways require excess NADPH co-factor in the synthesis of a C6 building block, an endogenous gene encoding a triose phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1) is attenuated. In some embodiments, where pathways require excess NADPH co-factor in the synthesis of a C6 building block, a recombinant glucose dehydrogenase such as the gene product oigdh is overexpressed in the host organism (Satoh et al, 2003, supra). In some embodiments, endogenous genes encoding enzymes facilitating the conversion of NADPH to NADH are attenuated, such as the NADH generation cycle that may be generated via inter-conversion of glutamate dehydrogenases in EC 1.4.1.2 (NADH-specific) and EC 1.4.1.4 (NADPH-specific); or transhydrogenases. In some embodiments, an endogenous gene encoding a glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3) that utilizes both NADH and NADPH as co-factors is attenuated. In some embodiments, a membrane-bound alkane 1-monooxygenase is solubilized via truncation of the N-terminal region that anchors the P450 to the endoplasmic reticulum (Scheller et al, J. Biol. Chem., 1994, 269(17), 12779 - 12783). In some embodiments using hosts that naturally accumulate polyhydroxyalkanoates, an endogenous gene encoding a polymer synthase enzyme can be attenuated in the host strain. In some embodiments using hosts that naturally accumulate lipid bodies, the associated genes encoding synthases can be attenuated in the host strain. In some embodiments, β-oxidation enzymes degrading central metabolites and central precursors leading to and including C6 building blocks are attenuated. In some embodiments, endogenous genes encoding enzymes activating C6 building blocks via Coenzyme A esterification such as CoA-ligases are attenuated. In some embodiments, the efflux of a C6 building block across the cell membrane to the extracellular media is enhanced or amplified by genetically engineering structural modifications to the cell membrane or increasing any associated transporter activity for a C6 building block. The efflux of hexamethylenediamine can be enhanced or amplified by overexpressing broad substrate range multidrug transporters such as Bit from Bacillus subtilis (Woolridge et al, 1997, J. Biol Chem., 272(14):8864 - 8866); AcrB and AcrD from Escherichia coli (Elkins & Nikaido, 2002, J. Bacteriol, 184(23), 6490 - 6499), NorA from Staphylococcus aereus (Ng et al, 1994, Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 38(6), 1345 - 1355), or Bmr from Bacillus subtilis (Neyfakh, 1992, Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 36(2), 484 - 485). The efflux of 6-aminohexanoate and heptamethylenediamine can be enhanced or amplified by overexpressing the solute transporters such as the lysE transporter from Corynebacterium glutamicum (Bellmann et al, 2001, Microbiology, 147, 1765 - 1774). The efflux of adipic acid can be enhanced or amplified by overexpressing a dicarboxylate transporter such as the SucE transporter from Corynebacterium glutamicum (Huhn et al., Appl. Microbiol & Biotech., 89(2), 327 - 335). Producing C6 Building Blocks Using a Recombinant Host Typically, one or more C6 building blocks can be produced by providing a host microorganism and culturing the provided microorganism with a culture medium containing a suitable carbon source as described above. In general, the culture media and/or culture conditions can be such that the microorganisms grow to an adequate density and produce a C6 building block efficiently. For large-scale production processes, any method can be used such as those described elsewhere (Manual of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology, 2nd Edition, Editors: A. L. Demain and J. E. Davies, ASM Press; and Principles of Fermentation Technology, P. F. Stanbury and A. Whitaker, Pergamon). Briefly, a large tank (e.g., a 100 gallon, 200 gallon, 500 gallon, or more tank) containing an appropriate culture medium is inoculated with a particular microorganism. After inoculation, the microorganism is incubated to allow biomass to be produced. Once a desired biomass is reached, the broth containing the microorganisms can be transferred to a second tank. This second tank can be any size. For example, the second tank can be larger, smaller, or the same size as the first tank. Typically, the second tank is larger than the first such that additional culture medium can be added to the broth from the first tank. In addition, the culture medium within this second tank can be the same as, or different from, that used in the first tank. Once transferred, the microorganisms can be incubated to allow for the production of a C6 building block. Once produced, any method can be used to isolate C6 building blocks. For example, C6 building blocks can be recovered selectively from the fermentation broth via adsorption processes. In the case of adipic acid and 6-aminoheptanoic acid, the resulting eluate can be further concentrated via evaporation, crystallized via evaporative and/or cooling crystallization, and the crystals recovered via centrifugation. In the case of hexamethylenediamine and 1,6- hexanediol, distillation may be employed to achieve the desired product purity. The invention will be further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Enzyme activity of CYP153 monooxygenase using hexanoate as substrate in forming 6-hydroxyhexanoate A nucleotide sequence encoding a HIS tag was added to each of the Polaromonas sp. JS666, Mycobacterium sp. HXN-1500 and Mycobacterium austroafricanum genes encoding (1) the monooxygenases (SEQ ID NOs: 16 - 18), respectively (2) the associated ferredoxin reductase partner (SEQ ID NOs: 19-20) and the specie's ferredoxin (SEQ ID NOs: 21-22). For the Mycobacterium austroafricanum monooxygenase, the Mycobacterium sp. HXN-1500 oxidoreductase and ferredoxin partners were used. The three modified nucleic acid sequences encoding the protein partners were cloned into a pgBlue expression vector under a hybrid pTac promoter. Each expression vector was transformed into a BL21 [DE3] E. coli host. Each resulting recombinant E. coli strain were cultivated at 37°C in a 500mL shake flask culture containing 50 mL LB media and antibiotic selection pressure. Each culture was induced for 24h at 28°C using 1 mM IPTG. The pellet from each induced shake flask culture was harvested via centrifugation. Each pellet was resuspended and the cells made permeable using Y- per™ solution (ThermoScientific, Rockford, IL) at room temperature for 20 min. The permeabilized cells were held at 0°C in the Y-per™ solution. Enzyme activity assays were performed in a buffer composed of a final concentration of 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH = 7.8), 1.7 mM MgS04, 2.5 mM NADPH and 30 mM hexanoate. Each enzyme activity assay reaction was initiated by adding a fixed mass of wet cell weight of permeabilized cells suspended in the Y-per™ solution to the assay buffer containing the heptanoate and then incubated at 28 °C for 24 h, with shaking at 1400 rpm in a heating block shaker. The formation of 7-hydroxyheptanoate was quantified via LC-MS. The monooxygenase gene products of SEQ ID NO 16 - 18 along with reductase and ferredoxin partners, accepted hexanoate as substrate as confirmed against the empty vector control (see FIG. 20) and synthesized 6-hydroxyhexanoate as reaction product. EXAMPLE 2 Enzyme activity of ω-transaminase using adipate semialdehyde as substrate and forming 6-aminohexanoate A nucleotide sequence encoding a His-tag was added to the genes from Chromobacterium violaceum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, and Vibrio fluvialis encoding the co-transaminases of SEQ ID NOs: 8, 9, 10, 1 1 and 13, respectively (see FIG. 21) such that N-terminal HIS tagged co-transaminases could be produced. Each of the resulting modified genes was cloned into a pET21a expression vector under control of the T7 promoter and each expression vector was transformed into a BL21 [DE3] E. coli host. The resulting recombinant E. coli strains were cultivated at 37°C in a 250mL shake flask culture containing 50 mL LB media and antibiotic selection pressure, with shaking at 230 rpm. Each culture was induced overnight at 16 °C using 1 mM IPTG. The pellet from each induced shake flask culture was harvested via centrifugation. Each pellet was resuspended and lysed via sonication. The cell debris was separated from the supernatant via centrifugation and the cell free extract was used immediately in enzyme activity assays. Enzyme activity assays in the reverse direction (i.e., 6-aminohexanoate to adipate semialdehyde) were performed in a buffer composed of a final concentration of 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH = 7.5), 10 mM 6-aminohexanoate, 10 mM pyruvate and 100 μΜ pyridoxyl 5' phosphate. Each enzyme activity assay reaction was initiated by adding cell free extract of the co-transaminase gene product or the empty vector control to the assay buffer containing the 6-aminohexanoate and incubated at 25°C for 24 h, with shaking at 250 rpm. The formation of L-alanine from pyruvate was quantified via RP-HPLC. Each enzyme only control without 6-aminohexanoate demonstrated low base line conversion of pyruvate to L-alanine. See FIG. 14. The gene product of SEQ ID NO 8, SEQ ID NO 10, SEQ ID NO 11 and SEQ ID NO 13 accepted 6-aminohexanote as substrate as confirmed against the empty vector control. See FIG. 15. Enzyme activity in the forward direction (i.e., adipate semialdehyde to 6- aminohexanoate) was confirmed for the transaminases of SEQ ID NO 8, SEQ ID NO 9, SEQ ID NO 10, SEQ ID NO 1 1 and SEQ ID NO 13. Enzyme activity assays were performed in a buffer composed of a final concentration of 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH = 7.5), 10 mM adipate semialdehyde, 10 mM L-alanine and 100 μΜ pyridoxyl 5' phosphate.

EXAMPLE 3 Enzyme activity of carboxylate reductase using adipate as substrate and forming adipate semialdehyde A nucleotide equence encoding a HIS-tag was added to the genes from Segniiiparus rugosus and Segniiiparus rotundus that encode the carboxylate reductases of SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 7, respectively (see FIG. 21), such that N-terminal HIS tagged carboxylate reductases could be produced. Each of the modified genes was cloned into a pET Duet expression vector along with a sfp gene encoding a HIS- tagged phosphopantetheine transferase from Bacillus subtilis, both under the T7 promoter. Each expression vector was transformed into a BL21 [DE3] E. coli host and the resulting recombinant is. coli strains were cultivated at 37°C in a 250mL shake flask culture containing 50 mL LB media and antibiotic selection pressure, with shaking at 230 rpm. Each culture was induced overnight at 37 °C using an auto- induction media. The pellet from each induced shake flask culture was harvested via centrifugation. Each pellet was resuspended and lysed via sonication, and the cell debris was separated from the supernatant via centrifugation. The carboxylate reductases and phosphopantetheine transferases were purified from the supernatant using Ni-affinity chromatography, diluted 10-fold into 50mM HEPES buffer (pH = 7.5), and concentrated via ultrafiltration.

Each enzyme activity assay reaction was initiated by adding purified carboxylate reductase and phosphopantetheine transferase or the empty vector control to the assay buffer containing the 6-hydroxyhexanoate and then incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The consumption of NADPH was monitored by absorbance at 340 nm. Each enzyme only control without 6-hydroxyhexanoate demonstrated low base line consumption of NADPH. See FIG. 9. The gene products of SEQ ID NO 3 - 7, enhanced by the gene product of sfp, accepted 6-hydroxyhexanoate as substrate as confirmed against the empty vector control (see FIG. 1 1), and synthesized 6-hydroxyhexanal. EXAMPLE 5 Enzyme activity of (O-transaminase for 6-aminohexanol, forming 6-oxohexanol A nucleotide sequence encoding an N-terminal His-tag was added to the Chromobacterium violaceum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio fluvialis genes encoding the ω-transaminases of SEQ ID NOs: 8 - 13, respectively (see FIG. 21) such that N- terminal HIS tagged ω-transaminases could be produced.

The cell debris was separated from the supernatant via centrifugation and the cell free extract was used immediately in enzyme activity assays. Enzyme activity assays in the reverse direction (i.e., 6-aminohexanol to 6- oxohexanol) were performed in a buffer composed of a final concentration of 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH = 7.5), 10 mM 6-aminohexanol, 10 mM pyruvate, and 100 μΜ pyridoxyl 5' phosphate. Each enzyme activity assay reaction was initiated by adding cell free extract of the co-transaminase gene product or the empty vector control to the assay buffer containing the 6-aminohexanol and then incubated at 25 °C for 4 h, with shaking at 250 rpm.
