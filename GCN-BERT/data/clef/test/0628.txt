Example 5A
Diethyl 5-[(ethylcarbamoyl)amino]-3-methylthiophene-2,4-dicarboxylate
100 mg (0.377 mmol) of diethyl 2-amino-4-methylthiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate (commercially available) were dissolved in 0.4 ml of pyridine. 0.122 ml (1.51 mmol) of ethyl isocyanate were added to the solution and the mixture was stirred at 80Â° C. After 28 h, the mixture was cooled to RT and the pyridine was distilled off. The residue was taken up in dichloromethane and concentrated again. The title compound (135 mg, 98% of theory) was obtained as brown crystals.
