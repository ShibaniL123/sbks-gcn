ï il °10 This invention relates to microwave frequency discriminators. One of the applications of a microwave fréquence OEiscriminator is in the examination of unwanted noise modulations in the output of a continuous wave klystron oscillator. These norse modulations can be divideoE into frequency and amplitude modulations. Generally an amplitude detector is used to detect amplitude modulations and a frequency discriminator is used o detect the frequency modulations sothat, for example, further analysis may be cooE21eted by a spectrum analyser. An arai»litude <'eteetor ms reasonably simple but a frequency õ.ŒEsorimínator often presents p;reatõr «li fioultio s. One fern o: mioro-,;:;ave frequency æisoriminator which has been employed makes use of a microwave cavity to convert a frequency modulation of an input signal, to an amplitude modulation. The cavity is tuned so that the nominal frequency of its input signal lies within one side of its resonance curve; the sensitivity of the Discriminator, as a converter of frequency to amplitude modulation, is thus deìændent upon the slope of resonance curve. } oreover when the frequency modulation of a signal is :- " small any un',-anted araplituãe modulation present in the signal will tend to mask the amplitude modulation which has been er-tved by convers!on from frequency modulation. . .ii::.: :. ..

According to the invention a microwave frequency discriminator comprises a microwave bridge having an input a ra, an output arm, an az n connected to a resonance cavity and a balancing a r,1 presenting an adjustable impédance to the bridge whereby, when the bridge is balanced for an input sígnal of a predetermined dation frequency, varíations of frequency of the input signal cause an output signal to be present in the output arm, and an output signal channel connected to the output arm and. terminating in a phase-sensitive-detector, whereby the output of the detector varies. in amplitude according to the frequency deviation of the input signal to the bridge. L. "directive feed may be coupled to the input a n of th bridge to provide a reference frequency signal for the phase-sensítive-rectifier which is related in chase and frequency to the input signal. An adjustable phase-shilter may be provided to adjust the phase of the reference signal. Conveniently bhe ',hase-sensitive-deteotor oioerates a I.F. (intermediate frequeuay) and separate mixers feŒE by a co ç non local oscillator are provided to change the frequency of the bridge output and reference signals before they = re applied to the phase-sensitive detector. An envelope-following-detector may be fed from the reference signal derived from the bridge input signal thereby enabling the detection and measurement of amplitude modulation present in the input signal. '4.. j, ti ï :t .j As an alternative to the use of the envelope-followingdetector for the OEetõotion of amplitude modulation a second phase sensitive detector fed from the bridge out]?ut and reference sígnals may be provided. A phase shifter is °í»rovided in the reference signal input to this sòcond detector to provide a 90° phase-shit. The output of the second detector then gives a sensitive indication o amplitude modulation on the inçout signa! to the bridge. In order to make the invention clearer a short discussion of the orinoi les involveŒEE v4ill no'c., ho glvõn together with a description, by v«ay of example, of a discriminator according to the invention. Reference v íll be made to the accompanying lapwings in v;hich: Fig. la, b, o shorts diagrams useful in appreciating the principle oí' the invention, Fig. 2 shows schematically the arrangement of one form of discriminator, and Fig. 3 shorts a useíhl addition to the discriminator of Fig. 2. In Fig. la a microwave bridge is formed by a hybrid arrangement I to which is connectes a cavity 2, an aì n 3 terminate by a varíable short-circuit 4 and containing a variable attenuator 5, an output an 6 Shoe an input anu 7.

The directive feed J2 couples to a reference channel J3 v;hich contains a phase shifter J4, a mixer J5 and an IF reference signal amplifier 16; the output of the reference signal amplifier J6 is fed as a reference signal to the phase sensitive detector 11.

If a frequency deviation i present in the output of the source 8 then an output will appear in the output arm 6 of the bridge. This is shown ín Fig. lb 'there a frequency deviation (Curve C,) about the source frequency pronounces a bri«ç.ge output as shown in curve G. The sense of the frequency deviation is not ap'garönt from the amplitude (Curve B) of the bridge output but conventional positive anti negative signs are shown which indicate the change o phase of the bridge output in the ann 6. The waveform of the amplitude modttlated output signal in the output arm 6 ef the brigtge is seen in Fig. o. The output signal from the output a u 6 of the bridge passes to the mixer where it ís reduoe(l to intermediate frequency an& sub sequently am olified in the amplifier 0 before being applied to the phase .... sensitive ãetector I.

Accordingly the »hase of the reference sígnal can be adjusted by means of the phase shifter 14 in the reference channel 13. The arrangement of Fig. la, acting as a frequency discriminator, has the advantage that, by virtue of the use of a ]»ridge, amplitude variation of the output of the source 8 will not materially affect the output sig, nal from 'the arm 6 of the bridge. In practice then the signa! fed to the phase sensitive detector 11 is in-sensitive to amplitude modulation present in the original signal. -. .... • Tho use of a phase sens:i, tive dotoetor ensures that any unwanted " " " am'»litudó modulation coming through fz' u the source on the signal and the " " reference channels is balanced to a large extent at the detector; this ....
