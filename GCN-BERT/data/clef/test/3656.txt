In order to move the distal knife portion 175 out of the way, further to the above, the distal knife portion 175 can be moved from its unactuated position (FIG. 18) to a dropped position which is illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 16A. In various embodiments, the firing member 170 can be retracted proximally such that the distal knife portion 175 can contact the frame 111 of the shaft 110 and/or a portion of the first jaw 121 and be displaced downwardly, for example, into a position in which the cartridge body 132 of a staple cartridge 130 can slide over the top of the distal knife portion 175, as described in greater detail below. In at least one such embodiment, referring now to FIG. 4A, the first jaw 121 can comprise at least one declined ramp, or cam, 118 wherein the knife portion 175 can be configured to contact the declined ramp 118 and slide down the declined surface thereof. In certain embodiments, the knife portion 175 can further comprise at least one corresponding declined surface, or follower, 178 which can be configured to engage the at least one declined ramp 118. In at least one such embodiment, the declined ramp 118 and the declined surface 178 can be oriented at the same, or at least substantially the same, angle. In certain embodiments, as a result, the knife portion 175, for example, of the firing member can descend in a direction which is transverse to its firing path, i.e., the path in which firing member 170 is advanced to fire, or deploy, the staples of the staple cartridge 130, as described in greater detail further below. In at least one such embodiment, such a firing path can comprise a longitudinal axis extending between its proximal, unactuated position and its distal, actuated position, for example. In various embodiments, referring to FIGS. 4A and 5A, the first jaw 121 can comprise one or more windows, openings, slots, channels, and/or recesses which can be configured to permit the distal knife portion 175 to move from its unactuated position to its dropped position. In at least one embodiment, the first jaw 121 can comprise a recess 119 which can be configured to receive the second flange 173 of the firing member 170 and a window, or opening, 109 which can be configured to permit the first flange 172 of the firing member 170 to at least partially drop downwardly out of the first jaw 121 when the knife portion 175 is moved into its dropped position. At such point, referring again to FIG. 16A, the distal knife portion 175 may no longer obstruct the path of the staple cartridges and, as a result, a staple cartridge 130 can be slid distally past the distal knife portion 175, as illustrated in FIGS. 17 and 17A, as described above. In at least one such embodiment, the top surface of the second flange 173 can be completely recessed within the recess 119, or positioned substantially flush with the top of the recess 119, such that the cartridge body 132 of a staple cartridge 130 can slide thereover. In various embodiments, the top surface of the second flange 173 can be aligned with and/or positioned below the cartridge support surfaces 115 and/or the cartridge support surfaces 125 such that the cartridge body 132 of the staple cartridge 130 can slide thereover without interference, or with little interference, therebetween. Further to the above, referring generally to FIG. 2A, each staple cartridge 130 can comprise a plurality of staple rows which can slide within a first lateral channel 113 alongside a first side of the distal knife portion 175 and a plurality of staple rows which can slide within a second lateral channel 113 alongside a second, or opposite, side of the distal knife portion 175 as the staple cartridge 130 is advanced past the distal knife portion 175 into the cartridge channel 122. In various embodiments, further to the above, the firing member 170 can also be selectively engaged with the first trigger 163 such that, when the first trigger 163 is pulled toward the pistol grip 162 to advance a staple cartridge 130 into the end effector 120, as described above, the first trigger 163 can pull the firing member 170 proximally into contact with the declined ramp 118 in order to move the distal knife portion 175 into its descended position. In various embodiments, the first trigger 163 can comprise another drive member which can be configured to engage the rack portion of the firing member 170 and pull the firing member 170 proximally when the first trigger 163 is actuated. Also similar to the above, such a drive member can become disengaged from the firing member 170 when the first trigger 163 has reached the end of its actuation such that the firing member 170 can be subsequently and independently actuated by the second trigger 164. Nonetheless, once the staple cartridge 130 has been slid past the lowered knife portion 175 and the staple cartridge 130 has been sufficiently positioned within the end effector 120, the cartridge driver 140 can be retracted to its unactuated position, as described above, and the firing member 170 can be returned upwardly to its unactuated position. In such circumstances, the firing member 170 can be displaced distally such that the declined surface 178 slides upwardly along the declined ramp 118. In at least one such embodiment, the firing member 170 can be resiliently deflected downwardly when the distal knife portion 175 is moved into its dropped position such that the firing member 170 can resiliently return to its unactuated position. In certain embodiments, the surgical instrument 100 can further comprise a spring which can be configured to bias the firing member 170 into its unactuated position. In any event, once a staple cartridge 130 has been positioned within the end effector 120, and the cartridge driver 140 and the firing member 170 have been returned to their unactuated positions, the firing sequence to deploy the staple cartridge 130 can begin, as described in greater detail further below. Turning now to FIG. 19 once again, the firing member 170 can be advanced distally from its unactuated position to engage the second jaw 123 and move the second jaw 123 into a closed position, as described above. In various circumstances, such movement of the firing member 170 can be generated by a partial actuation of the second trigger 164 wherein, if the surgeon desires, the surgeon can release the partially-actuated second trigger 164 to return the firing member 170 back to its unactuated position and allow the second jaw 123 to be returned to its open position. In at least one such embodiment, the end effector 120 can comprise a spring which can be configured to bias the second jaw 123 into its open position as the firing member 170 is being retracted. Furthermore, the handle 160 can further comprise a trigger spring operably engaged with the second trigger 164 which can be configured to return the second trigger 164 to its unactuated position when it is released by the surgeon. In any event, the surgeon can reopen the end effector 120 in order to reposition the jaws 121 and 123 relative to the targeted tissue and, once the surgeon is satisfied with the position of the jaws 121 and 123, the surgeon can actuate the second trigger 164 to close the second jaw 123 once again. As the second jaw 123 is moved into its closed position, the second jaw 123 can contact the tissue positioned intermediate the first jaw 121 and the second jaw 123 and position the tissue against a top, or tissue-contacting, surface 136 of the cartridge body 132. In at least one such embodiment, the tips of the staple may be recessed with respect to, and/or positioned flush with, the tissue-contacting surface 136 such that, when the tissue is compressed against the cartridge body 132, the staple tips do not penetrate, or at least substantially penetrate, the tissue positioned thereagainst. Once the second jaw 123 has been closed and the tissue has been compressed, the firing member 170 can be advanced distally, as described above. Upon comparing FIG. 19 and FIG. 20, the reader will note that the firing member 170 has been partially advanced within the end effector 120. As illustrated in FIG. 20, the distal end of the firing member 170 can be configured to sequentially engage a plurality of staple drivers 180 positioned within the first jaw 121 in order to lift a plurality of staples 190 toward the second jaw 123. Referring now to FIGS. 9 and 10, the distal portion of the firing member 170 can further comprise one or more lift ramps 171 which can be configured to engage the staple drivers 180 and lift the staple drivers 180 upwardly as the lift ramps 171 pass thereunder. Referring now to FIGS. 6, 7, 8, 8A, 8B, and 8C, each staple driver 180 can comprise a corresponding inclined surface 181 which can be contacted by a lift ramp 171. In various embodiments, the lift ramps 171 of the firing member and the inclined surfaces 181 of the staple drivers 180 can be inclined at the same, or at least substantially the same, angle. Referring primarily to FIGS. 6 and 7, each staple driver 180 can comprise one or more staple cradles 187 which can each be configured to support a staple 190 thereon, as illustrated in FIG. 19. In at least one embodiment, referring now to FIGS. 13 and 14, each staple 190 can comprise a base 197, which can be positioned within a cradle 187, and one or more staple legs 196 extending upwardly from the base 197. As also illustrated in FIGS. 13 and 14, at least a portion of the staple legs 196 can be positioned within and/or extend through the cartridge body 132 wherein, as described in greater detail below, the staple drivers 180 can be configured to move the staples 190 relative to the cartridge body 132 as the firing member 170 is advanced. Referring primarily to FIG. 120, the lift ramps 171 of the firing member 170 can contact the proximal-most staple drivers 180 and begin to lift them, and the staples 190 supported thereon, toward the second jaw 123. As the firing member 170 is progressed even further toward the distal end of the end effector 120, the lift ramps 171 can sequentially contact the staple drivers 180 and lift the staples 190 supported thereon toward the second jaw 123. As illustrated in FIG. 20, the staple drivers 180 can progressively slide up the lift ramps 171 as the lift ramps 171 are slid thereunder. In various embodiments, the cartridge body 132 of the staple cartridge 130 can be held in place by the tissue and the second jaw 123 wherein, as a result, the staple legs 196 of the staples 190 can move relative to the cartridge body 132 when the staples 190 are lifted upwardly. In various embodiments, referring again to FIGS. 13 and 14, the cartridge body 132 can comprise a plurality of guide slots 139 which can each be configured to guide the staple legs 196 as they are moved relative to the cartridge body 132. In at least one embodiment, the guide slots 139 can be configured to closely receive the staple legs 196 such that relative movement therebetween can be limited to the upward movement described herein. As the staple legs 196 are lifted upwardly, the staple legs 196 can emerge from the cartridge body 132 through holes, or apertures, 138 defined in the cartridge body 132. In various embodiments, referring again to FIGS. 13 and 14, the cartridge body 132 can further comprise a plurality of longitudinal rails 134 in which the guide slots 139 and the apertures 138 can be defined. In at least one such embodiment, the longitudinal rails 134 can define three rows of staples 190 on a first side of a longitudinal slot 157 and three rows of staples 190 on a second side of the slot 157, for example. As described above, the staple drivers 180 can be displaced upwardly toward the second jaw 123. In various embodiments, referring primarily now to FIG. 4A, the cartridge channel 122 of the first jaw 121 can comprise one or more features configured to guide the staple drivers 180 along a predetermined path as they are moved relative to the cartridge channel 122. In at least one embodiment, referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, each staple driver 180 can comprise a guide rail 182 which can be configured to be slidably received within a guide slot 126 defined in the outer sidewalls of the cartridge channel 122. In at least one such embodiment, the guide slots 126 can each be configured to confine the movement of a staple driver 180 along a straight line, or axis, which can be perpendicular, or at least substantially perpendicular, to the top surface 136 of the cartridge body 132, for example. In addition to or in lieu of the above, the cartridge channel 122 can further comprise one or more guide channels 127, for example, defined in the inner sidewalls of the cartridge channel 122 which can at least partially comprise cavities configured to slidably receive at least a portion of the drivers 180 therein. In various embodiments, the guide channels 127 can each be configured to confine the movement of a staple driver along a straight line which can be perpendicular, or at least substantially perpendicular, to the top surface 136 of the cartridge body 132, for example. In embodiments comprising both guide slots 126 and guide channels 127, each driver 180 can be guided on opposite sides thereof, for example. In various embodiments, further to the above, the second jaw 123 can comprise an anvil 124 which can be configured to deform the staple legs 196 of the staples 190, as illustrated in FIGS. 20 and 21. In certain embodiments, the anvil 124 can comprise a plurality of staple pockets, for example, which can each be configured to receive at least one staple leg 196 therein and deform the staple legs 196 to a desired configuration. As the staple legs 196 are being deformed, each staple 190 can capture a portion of the tissue therein and compress the tissue against the top surface 136 of the cartridge body 132. In various embodiments, the staple legs 196 of each staple 190 can be bent inwardly toward one another and hold and/or compress the tissue captured therebetween against a bridge 195 extending between the staple leg apertures 198 defined in the cartridge body 132, for example. In certain embodiments, the staples 190 can be pushed upwardly until the bases 196 of the staples 190 are positioned adjacent to or in contact with the bridges 195. In at least one embodiment, referring primarily to FIG. 14, the cartridge body 132 can comprise a first portion including two or more rows of staples 190 and a second portion including two or more rows of staples 190, for example, wherein the first portion can be connected to the second portion by one or more connectors 156. In at least one such embodiment, the connectors 156 can extend across a longitudinal slot 157 defined in the cartridge body 132 wherein the connectors 156 can be broken and/or incised by the distal knife portion 175 as the firing member 170 is advanced distally to deploy the staples 190 and transect the tissue, as described above. After the connectors 156 have been separated, broken, or incised, the first and second portions of the cartridge body 132 may be unconnected to one another. As illustrated in FIG. 21, the firing member 170 can be advanced distally until the distal knife portion 175 of the firing member 170 has reached the distal end of the end effector 120. At such point, in various circumstances, all of the staple drivers 180 will have been moved from their unfired positions to their fired positions, as also illustrated in FIG. 21. In certain other circumstances, the firing member 170 may not be fully advanced within the end effector 120 and only some of the staple drivers 180 may be moved upwardly from their unfired positions. In either event, the firing bar 170 can be retracted to its unactuated position after firing at least some of the staples 190. In various embodiments, referring now to FIG. 22, the distal knife portion 175 of the firing member 170 can be configured to engage the fired staple drivers 180 and return the staple drivers 180 to their unfired position as the firing bar 170 is being retracted. Referring now to FIGS. 8A and 8B, each driver 180 can further comprise a reset ramp 186 which can be engaged by a reset member 174 extending from the firing member 170. More particularly, a reset member 174 of the firing member 170 can enter into a reset cavity 184 defined in the driver 180 such that a bottom drive, or cam, surface 176 extending along the bottom side of the reset member 174 can engage the reset ramp 186 and push the reset ramp 186 downwardly, i.e., toward its unfired position. In various embodiments, the drive surface 176 and the resent ramp 186 can be oriented at the same, or at least substantially the same, angle while, in other embodiments, they may be oriented at different angles. In various other embodiments, a staple driver 180 can include any suitable surface against which the drive surface 176 can apply a force thereto. In at least one embodiment, the reset member 174 can comprise a proximal lead-in portion 174a which, in certain circumstances, can be configured to enter the reset cavity 184 before the drive surface 176 contacts the reset ramp 186. In at least one such embodiment, the proximal lead-in portion 174a can comprise a beveled surface which can initially contact the staple driver 180 and adjust the position of the staple driver 180 before the staple driver 180 is cammed downwardly by the drive surface 176. As discussed above, the movement of each staple driver 180 can be confined to a vertical path, for example, wherein each staple driver 180 can be displaced downwardly along this vertical path as the reset member 174 passes therethrough. By the time that a distal portion 174b of the reset member 174 has exited the reset cavity 184 of the staple driver 180, in various embodiments, the staple driver 180 will have been returned to its unfired position. Referring again to FIGS. 22 and 23, the reset members 174 of the firing member 170 can initially reset the distal-most staple drivers 180 and then sequentially reset the remainder of the staple drivers 180 as the firing member 170 is retracted to its unactuated position. As the firing member 170 is being retracted, the second flange 173 of the firing member 170 can exit the longitudinal slot 103 of the second jaw 123 thereby allowing the second jaw 123 to re-open, as discussed above. Once the second jaw 123 has been sufficiently re-opened, as illustrated in FIG. 23, the first jaw 121 can be moved away from the implanted staple cartridge 130a. More particularly, as discussed above, the staples 190 can capture the cartridge body 132 against the tissue such that, when the first jaw 121 is moved away from the tissue, the cartridge body 132 can detach from the first jaw 121 and remain behind with the tissue. After the staple cartridge 130a has been implanted and removed from the staple cartridge channel 122, a second staple cartridge, such as staple cartridge 130b, for example, can be advanced into the staple cartridge channel 122. As described above, the firing member 170 can be retracted from its unactuated position to its lowered position such that the staple cartridge 130b can be advanced distally past the firing member 170 and into the end effector 120 by the cartridge driver 140. At such point, the reloaded surgical stapler 100 can be used once again. After the second staple cartridge 130b has been implanted, further to the above, a third staple cartridge 130c can be advanced into the end effector 120. In fact, the illustrated embodiment of surgical stapler 100 can comprise five staple cartridges 130 positioned therein although other embodiments are contemplated which comprise less than five staple cartridges or more than five staple cartridges positioned therein. In any event, a continuous, or sequential, supply of staple cartridges 130 may allow the surgeon to repeatedly use the surgical stapler 100 without having to remove the end effector 120 from the surgical site in order to be reloaded. Stated another way, certain previous surgical staplers required the end effectors thereof to be removed from the surgical site in order to be reloaded, which increased the time needed to complete a surgical procedure. Furthermore, certain previous surgical staplers required a surgeon to remove a spent staple cartridge from the end effectors thereof in order to insert a new staple cartridge, which also increased the time needed to complete a surgical procedure. In any event, certain embodiments are contemplated herein wherein, once the supply of staple cartridges 130 contained within the shaft 110 have been exhausted, additional staple cartridges 130 can be inserted into the shaft 110 of the surgical stapler 100 such that the staple cartridges 130 can be fed into the end effector 120, as described above. Furthermore, at least one embodiment is contemplated in which a staple cartridge 130 can be manually inserted into the staple cartridge channel 122 after the supply of staple cartridges 130 contained within the surgical stapler 100 has been exhausted. As described above, the surgical stapler 100 can be configured to supply a continuous, or sequential, number of staple cartridges 130 into the end effector 120. As also described above, the cartridge driver 140 of the surgical stapler 100 can be reciprocated between proximal and distal positions in order to sequentially advance the distal-most staple cartridge 130 contained within the shaft 110 into the cartridge channel 122. Stated another way, the cartridge driver 140 can be configured to advance a staple cartridge 130 from a staging position (FIG. 16) to a loaded position (FIG. 2) and, after the cartridge driver 140 has been returned to its proximal position and the loaded staple cartridge 130 has been implanted, the cartridge driver 140 can advance another staple cartridge 130 from the staging position to the loaded position once again. In at least one such embodiment, the cartridge driver 140 can extend over the proximal-most staple cartridges 130 such that the distal end of the cartridge 140 can directly engage the distal-most staple cartridge 130. In various embodiments, referring again to FIG. 3, the surgical instrument 100 can further comprise a biasing member 150 which can be configured to supply the staging position with another staple cartridge 130 as the staple cartridge 130 that was previously positioned in the staging position is advanced into the cartridge channel 122, as described above. In at least one such embodiment, the biasing member 150 can comprise a distal sled 151 which can be configured to contact the proximal-most cartridge 130 and, in addition, one or more push rods 152 which can be configured to transmit a biasing force to the distal sled 151. In at least one such embodiment, the biasing member 150 can comprise a spring and/or any other suitable resilient member which can be configured to apply a continuous biasing force to the proximal-most cartridge 130. Referring again to FIG. 13, the cartridge body 132 of each staple cartridge 130 can comprise alignment protrusions 137 which can be engaged by the distal sled 151 to transmit the biasing force to the cartridge body 132. In certain embodiments, the alignment protrusions 137 can define the proximal recess 131 wherein the distal sled 151 can be received within the proximal recess 131. In various embodiments, further to the above, the biasing force applied to the proximal-most staple cartridge 130 by the biasing member 150 can cause the proximal-most staple cartridge 130 to slide forward and/or abut the adjacent staple cartridge 130 positioned distally thereto. With respect to FIG. 3, the biasing member 150 can apply a biasing force to the staple cartridge 130e which can abut the staple cartridge 130d and transmit the biasing force thereto. Similarly, the staple cartridge 130d can abut the staple cartridge 130c and the staple cartridge 130c can abut the staple cartridge 130b such that the biasing force is transmitted from the biasing member 150 all the way to the second staple cartridge 130b, for example. As the reader will appreciate, the biasing force being applied to the proximal-most staple cartridge 130e by the biasing member 150 tends to push all of the staple cartridges 130 distally and, specifically, tends to push the second staple cartridge 130b distally out of the staging position. In order to hold the second staple cartridge 130b, and/or any other staple cartridge 130, in the staging position until it is advanced distally by the cartridge driver 140, as described above, the shaft frame 111, for example, can comprise one or more holding members which can be configured to releasably hold a staple cartridge 130 in the staging position. Referring now to FIG. 15, the shaft frame 111 can comprise retention arms 107 which can each include a stop 106 configured to block the distal advancement of a staple cartridge 130. More particularly, the stops 106 can be aligned with the support ledges 115 such that cartridge body 132 of the staple cartridge 130 can abut the stops 106 and such that the stops 106 can releasably hold the cartridge body132 within the support ledges 115. In at least one such embodiment, the stops 106 can define the distal end of the staging position wherein, when a staple cartridge is in contact with the stops 106, the staple cartridge 130 can be held in the staging position. In various embodiments, the retention arms 107 are sufficiently stiff to withstand and resist the biasing force being transmitted through the staple cartridges 130 by the biasing member 150, as described above. In such embodiments, however, the cartridge driver 140 is able to supply a sufficient force to the second cartridge 130b in order to dislodge it from the staging position and advance it distally. In such circumstances, the retention arms 107, and the stops 106 defined therein, can flex or move outwardly such that the second staple cartridge 130b, for example, can pass thereby. As the staple cartridge 130b is moved distally, the retention arms 107 can be engaged with the side rails 133 of the cartridge body 132 and, once the cartridge body 132 has passed by the retention arms 107, the retention arms 107 can resiliently return inwardly. Further to the above, the reader will note that, as the second staple cartridge 130b is being advanced distally, the biasing member 150 may act to keep the third staple cartridge 130c in contact with the second staple cartridge 130b. In such circumstances, the retention arms 107 may resiliently return from their expanded position to catch the third staple cartridge 130c and hold the staple cartridge 130c in the staging position. In at least one embodiment, the cartridge body 132 of each staple cartridge may comprise a divot or recess, for example, defined in the distal ends of the side rails 133 which can provide a suitable catch for the resilient arms 107 to engage and stop a staple cartridge 130 from being prematurely advanced out of the staging position. In addition to or in lieu of the above, the side rails 133 of each cartridge body 132 may also comprise a proximal divot or recess, for example, which can allow the resilient arms 107 to resiliently return to their unflexed state prior to the subsequent staple cartridge 130 reaching its fully staged position and thereby stop the subsequent staple cartridge 130 from being advanced past the staging position. In any event, once the second staple cartridge 130b has been positioned in the end effector 120 by the cartridge driver 140, the cartridge driver 140 can be retracted to its proximal, unactuated position such that the distal end 141 of the cartridge driver 140 is positioned within the distal recess 131 of the third staple cartridge 131 c. After the second cartridge 130b has been deployed, the cartridge driver 140 can advance the third staple cartridge 130c from the staging position into the end effector 120 as the biasing member 150 advances the fourth staple cartridge 130d into the staging position. Similarly, after the third cartridge 130c has been deployed, the cartridge driver 140 can advance the fourth staple cartridge 130d from the staging position into the end effector 120 as the biasing member 150 advances the fifth staple cartridge 130e into the staging position, and so forth. As described above, a staple cartridge 130 can be slid into the end effector 120 such that the staples 190 of the staple cartridge 130 can be deployed, or fired, by the staple drivers 180. In various embodiments, the staple cartridge 130 can be advanced to a predetermined position in which the bases 197 of the staples 190 are aligned with the staple cradles 187 of the staple drivers 180. In at least one embodiment, the cartridge channel 122 can comprise a forward stop, or datum, against which the staple cartridge 130 can be positioned by the cartridge driver 140 wherein, when the cartridge body 132 is positioned against this datum, the bases 197 of the staples 190 may be aligned with the staple cradles 187. In various embodiments, the support ledges 125 defined in the sides of the cartridge channel 122 and/or the support ledges 115 defined in the shaft frame 111, for example, can define channels, slots, and/or recesses configured to closely receive the support rails 133. In at least one such embodiment, referring primarily to FIG. 14, the support ledges 115, and/or the support ledges 125, can comprise an at least partially enclosed trough which can prohibit, or at least limit, the upward movement of the cartridge body 132 relative to the shaft frame 111, and/or cartridge channel 122. In various embodiments, the troughs comprising the support ledges 125 can be configured to releasably hold the cartridge body 132 in position until the first jaw 121 is moved away from the implanted cartridge body 132, as described above. In at least one such embodiment, the cartridge body 132 can be configured to flex as the first jaw 121 is pulled away such that that support rails 133 can pop or snap out of the support ledge troughs. In various embodiments, the cartridge body 132 can be comprised of at least one bioabsorbable, biocompatible, and/or biostable plastic material, for example, which is sufficiently flexible to flex as described above. As described above, the surgical instrument 100 can comprise a plurality of staple cartridges 130a-130e, for example, stored therein which can be consecutively or sequentially supplied to the end effector 120 thereof. In various embodiments, the staple cartridges 130a-130e, for example, can be identical, or at least substantially identical. In at least one embodiment, the staples 190 of the staple cartridges 130a-130e can each be comprised of a wire having the same, or at least substantially the same, diameter, for example. In various embodiments, this wire can be comprised of at least one metal, such as stainless steel and/or titanium, for example. In various other embodiments, one or more of the staple cartridges stored within the surgical stapler 100 are different than the other staple cartridges stored within the surgical stapler 100 in at least one regard. In at least one such embodiment, one or more of the staple cartridges stored within the surgical stapler 100 can comprise staples having at least one different diameter. For example, a first staple cartridge stored within the surgical stapler can comprise a plurality of first staples comprised of wires having a first diameter, a second staple cartridge stored within the surgical stapler can comprise a plurality of second staples comprised of wires having a second diameter, and a third staple cartridge stored within the surgical stapler can comprise a plurality of third staples comprised of wires having a third diameter, wherein the first diameter can be different than the second diameter, the second diameter can be different than the third diameter, and the first diameter can be different than the third diameter. In certain embodiments, a staple cartridge can comprise a first row of staples comprised of wires having a first diameter, a second row of staples comprised of wires having a second diameter, and/or a third row of staples comprised of wires having a third diameter, wherein the first diameter can be different than the second diameter, the second diameter can be different than the third diameter, and the first diameter can be different than the third diameter, for example. In certain embodiments, one or more of the staple cartridges stored within the surgical stapler 100 can comprise staples having at least one different unformed height. For example, a first staple cartridge stored within the surgical stapler can comprise a plurality of first staples having a first height, a second staple cartridge stored within the surgical stapler can comprise a plurality of second staples having a second height, and a third staple cartridge stored within the surgical stapler can comprise a plurality of third staples having a third height, wherein the first height can be different than the second height, the second height can be different than the third height, and the first height can be different than the third height.
