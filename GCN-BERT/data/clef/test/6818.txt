Example 39: Synthesis of N-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-(4-(4-((1-methylazetidin-3-yl)ethynyl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanamidedihydrocloride
Step 1: Synthesis of methyl 2-methyl-4-(4-(4-((1-methylazetidin-3-yl)ethynyl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate
To a solution of methyl 4-(4-(4-(azetidin-3-ylethynyl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate dihydrochloride (Intermediate 4) (1.5 g, 1 eq) in dichloromethane (30 ml) was added with formaldehyde (37 wt %, 0.89 ml, 4 eq) and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (2.53 g, 4 eq). The mixture was stirred for 5 hr at room temperature, and extracted with ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed with sat. aq. NaHCO3, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (0.9 g, 68%).
