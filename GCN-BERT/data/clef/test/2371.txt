Method for detecting multispecific antibody light chain mispairing Herein is reported a method for the determination of light chain mispairing in a multispecific antibody preparation based on limited proteolytic digestion and ESI- MS analysis. The method can be used for quality control or cell line selection. Background of the Invention In 1995 Yamaguchi et al. (J. Immunol. Meth. 181 (1995) 259-267) reported a method for proteolytic fragmentation with high specificity of mouse immunoglobulin G using lysyl endopeptidase, clostripain, metalloendopeptidase and V8 protease, whereby under the reaction conditions examined clostripain, lysyl endopeptidase, metalloendopeptidase, and V8 protease failed to cleave lgGl and lgG 1 -CM selectively in the hinge region. Matsuda et al. (FEBS Lett. 473 (2000) 349-357) reported a method for the preparation of Fc fragments using Lys-C for obtaining information of the Fc- associated glycoforms by MS for determining the pairing of oligosaccharides in the Fc region of immunoglobulin G. Villanueva et al. (J. Mass Spectrom. 37 (2002) 974-984) reported a limited proteolysis methodology, based on the use of unspecific exoproteases coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), to map quickly secondary structure elements of a protein from both ends, the N- and C-termini. In WO 2005/073732 a method of analysis of high molecular weight proteins, specifically, a reversed-phase LC/MS method of analysis of high molecular weight proteins including antibodies, is reported. WO 2006/047340 relates to subjecting column isolated preparations of polypeptides with a reduction/oxidation reagent and a chaotropic agent and isolating the refolded active protein produced from said contacting. The active proteins can be high molecular weight proteins including Fc domain containing polypeptides or fragments. Kleemann et al. (Anal. Chem. 80 (2008) 2001-2009) reported the characterization of IgGl immunoglobulins and peptide-Fc fusion proteins by limited proteolysis in conjunction with LC-MS. Applying limited proteolysis using endoproteinase Lys-C resulted in the predominant cleavage C-terminal of this lysine residue. Summary of the Invention It has been found that for the determination of light chain mispairing in a multispecific antibody limited proteolysis of the (multispecific) antibody has to be performed prior to MS analysis as the determination of light chain mispairing in a complete multispecific antibody is hampered by isobaric mass interference. Thus, one aspect as reported herein is the use of a limited digestion with a proteolytic enzyme of a multispecific antibody for the analysis of the multispecific antibody's light chain pairing. One aspect as reported herein is the use of a limited digestion with a proteolytic enzyme of a multispecific antibody for the determination of light chain mispairing in the multispecific antibody. One aspect as reported herein is the use of a limited digestion with a proteolytic enzyme of a multispecific antibody produced by a recombinant mammalian cell for the selection of a multispecific antibody producing mammalian cell. In one embodiment of all previous aspects the analysis/determination/selection is by using the result of a mass spectrometry of the digested antibody. One aspect as reported herein is a method for the determination of the light chain pairing in a multispecific antibody comprising the following steps: a) incubating a sample comprising the multispecific antibody with a proteolytic enzyme for a limited time, b) identifying the mass of the fragments obtained by the limited proteolytic digestion in step a) by mass spectrometry, and c) determining from the results in step b) the light chain pairing of the multispecific antibody. One aspect as reported herein is a method for the determination of light chain mispairing of a multispecific antibody comprising the following steps: a) incubating a sample comprising the multispecific antibody with a proteolytic enzyme for a limited time, b) identifying the mass of the fragments obtained by the limited proteolytic digestion in step a) by mass spectrometry, and c) determining from the results in step b) the light chain pairing of the multispecific antibody and thereby determining light chain mispairing. One aspect as reported herein is a method for the selection of a recombinant mammalian cell producing a multispecific antibody comprising the following steps: a) individually incubating a sample comprising a multispecific antibody produced by a clonal population of a recombinant mammalian cell of a multitude of recombinant mammalian cells all cells of the multitude producing the same multispecific antibody with a proteolytic enzyme for a limited time, b) identifying the mass of the fragments obtained by the limited proteolytic digestion in step a) by mass spectrometry, c) determining from the results in step b) the presence of light chain mispairing of the multispecific antibody for each clonal cell population, and d) selecting based on the results in step c) a recombinant cell producing a multispecific antibody.

Detailed Description of the Invention DEFINITIONS As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the" include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a cell" includes a plurality of such cells and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth. As well, the terms "a" (or "an"), "one or more" and "at least one" can be used interchangeably herein. In contrast thereto reference to "one cell" does not include a plurality of such cells but is limited to a single (isolated) cell. It is also to be noted that the terms "comprising", "including", and "having" can be used interchangeably. Further it is also to be noted that the term "comprising" encompasses the term "consisting of as limitation. The term "antibody" is used herein in the broadest sense and encompasses various antibody structures, including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., at least bispecific antibodies) as long as these antibody structures are multispecific and comprise at least two non- peptidically bound light chains. The term "non-peptidically bound" denotes that two polypeptides are not associated with each other by a peptide bond (formed between amino- and carboxy- groups of amino acids). Nevertheless these polypeptides can be associated by other covalent bonds such as disulfide bonds or non-covalently. The term "chimeric" antibody refers to an antibody in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is derived from a particular source or species, while the remainder of the heavy and/or light chain is derived from a different source or species. The "class" of an antibody refers to the type of constant domain or constant region possessed by its heavy chain. There are five major classes of antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl, and IgA2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called Î±, Î´, Îµ, Î³, and Î¼, respectively. The term "Fc-region" herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain that contains at least a portion of the constant region. The term includes native sequence Fc-regions and variant Fc-regions. In one embodiment, a human IgG heavy chain Fc-region extends from Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus of the heavy chain. However, the C-terminal lysine (Lys447) of the Fc-region may or may not be present. Unless otherwise specified herein, numbering of amino acid residues in the Fc-region or constant region is according to the EU numbering system, also called the EU index, as described in Kabat, E.A. et al, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th ed., Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991), NIH Publication 91-3242. The terms "full length antibody", "intact antibody," and "whole antibody" are used herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody having a structure substantially similar to a native antibody structure or having heavy chains that contain an Fc region as defined herein. The terms "host cell", "host cell line", and "host cell culture" are used interchangeably and refer to cells into which exogenous nucleic acid has been introduced, including the progeny of such cells. Host cells include "transformants" and "transformed cells," which include the primary transformed cell and progeny derived therefrom without regard to the number of passages. Progeny may not be completely identical in nucleic acid content to a parent cell, but may contain mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened or selected for in the originally transformed cell are included herein. A "human antibody" is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human or a human cell or derived from a non-human source that utilizes human antibody repertoires or other human antibody-encoding sequences. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues. A "humanized" antibody refers to a chimeric antibody comprising amino acid residues from non-human HVRs and amino acid residues from human FRs. In certain embodiments, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the HVRs (e.g., CDRs) correspond to those of a non-human antibody, and all or substantially all of the FRs correspond to those of a human antibody. A humanized antibody optionally may comprise at least a portion of an antibody constant region derived from a human antibody. A "humanized form" of an antibody, e.g., a non- human antibody, refers to an antibody that has undergone humanization. An "isolated" antibody is one which has been separated from a component of its natural environment. In some embodiments, an antibody is purified to greater than 95% or 99% purity as determined by, for example, electrophoretic (e.g., SDS- PAGE, isoelectric focusing (IEF), capillary electrophoresis) or chromatographic (e.g., ion exchange or reverse phase HPLC). For review of methods for assessment of antibody purity, see, e.g., Flatman, S. et al, J. Chromatogr. B 848 (2007) 79-87. An "isolated" nucleic acid refers to a nucleic acid molecule that has been separated from a component of its natural environment. An isolated nucleic acid includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily contain the nucleic acid molecule, but the nucleic acid molecule is present extrachromosomally or at a chromosomal location that is different from its natural chromosomal location. The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical and/or bind the same epitope, except for possible variant antibodies, e.g., containing naturally occurring mutations or arising during production of a monoclonal antibody preparation, such variants generally being present in minor amounts. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. Thus, the modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including but not limited to the hybridoma method, recombinant DNA methods, phage-display methods, and methods utilizing transgenic animals containing all or part of the human immunoglobulin loci, such methods and other exemplary methods for making monoclonal antibodies being described herein. The term "variable region" or "variable domain" refers to the domain of an antibody heavy or light chain that is involved in binding the antibody to antigen. The variable domains of the heavy chain and light chain (VH and VL, respectively) of a native antibody generally have similar structures, with each domain comprising four conserved framework regions (FRs) and three hypervariable regions (HVRs). (See, e.g., Kindt, T.J. et al. Kuby Immunology, 6th ed., W.H. Freeman and Co., N.Y. (2007), page 91) A single VH or VL domain may be sufficient to confer antigen-binding specificity. Furthermore, antibodies that bind a particular antigen may be isolated using a VH or VL domain from an antibody that binds the antigen to screen a library of complementary VL or VH domains, respectively. See, e.g., Portolano, S. et al, J. Immunol. 150 (1993) 880-887; Clackson, T. et al, Nature 352 (1991) 624-628). The term "vector," as used herein, refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of propagating another nucleic acid to which it is linked. The term includes the vector as a self-replicating nucleic acid structure as well as the vector incorporated into the genome of a host cell into which it has been introduced. Certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of nucleic acids to which they are operative ly linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as "expression vectors". DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Herein is reported a method for the determination of light chain mispairing in a multispecific antibody preparation based on limited proteolytic digestion and ESI- MS analysis. The method can be used for quality control or cell line selection. It has been found that for the determination of light chain mispairing in a multispecific antibody limited proteolysis of the (multispecific) antibody has to be performed prior to MS analysis as the determination of light chain mispairing in a complete multispecific antibody is hampered by isobaric mass interference. Thus, one aspect as reported herein is the use of a limited digestion with a proteolytic enzyme of a multispecific antibody for the analysis of the multispecific antibody's light chain pairing. In a bivalent multispecific antibody, i.e. in a bivalent bispecific antibody, one light chain mispairing product is possible (see Figure 1). In one exemplary embodiment of the methods as reported herein two samples of a bivalent bispecific antibody has been digested with plasmin (EC 3.4.21.7). In all samples no uncleaved intact antibody was present after the digestion. In sample 1 approximately 20 % of light-chain mispaired antibody is detectable (see Figure 3) whereas in the second sample no light-chain mispaired antibody is detectable (see Figure 4). In one exemplary embodiment of the methods as reported herein a sample of a bivalent bispecific antibody has been limited digested with Lys-C. In the sample light-chain mispaired antibody is detectable (see Figure 5). If more than 2 light chains are present, e.g. in a trivalent or tetravalent multispecific antibody, more than one light chain mispairing product is possible (see Figure 2). In a mass spectrometric analysis of the complete antibody it is only possible to determine the presence of a light chain mispaired product but not the stoichiometry and the orientation of a potential mispairing cannot be detected (see Figure 6). Different proteolytic enzymes can be chosen for this task: - Ides: cleaves below the hinge region (cannot be used in an antibody with the L234A, L235A mutation) - plasmin: cleaves above the hinge region - pepsin: cleaves below the hinge region; results in a degraded Fc-region - Lys-C: cleaves above the hinge region. In one exemplary embodiment of the methods as reported herein a sample of a tetravalent bispecific antibody has been limited digested with Lys-C. It has been found that for a tetravalent multispecific antibody the mispairing in the Fab region form from light chain 1 and the heavy chain 1 fragment can be detected better at an ISCID of 0 whereas the Fc-region fragment comprising the second light chain can be detected better at an ISCID of 90. In order to remove the Fc-region a Protein A affinity chromatography can be used to separate the Fab fragments from the Fc-region after the enzymatic digestion. The Fab fragments are in the flow-through of the Protein A affinity chromatography. Chimeric and humanized antibodies In certain embodiments, an antibody analyzed with the methods as reported herein is a chimeric antibody. Certain chimeric antibodies are described, e.g., in US 4,816,567; and Morrison, S.L. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 (1984) 6851-6855). In one example, a chimeric antibody comprises a non-human variable region (e.g., a variable region derived from a mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, or non- human primate, such as a monkey) and a human constant region. In a further example, a chimeric antibody is a "class switched" antibody in which the class or subclass has been changed from that of the parent antibody. Chimeric antibodies include antigen-binding fragments thereof. In certain embodiments, a chimeric antibody is a humanized antibody. Typically, a non-human antibody is humanized to reduce immunogenicity to humans, while retaining the specificity and affinity of the parental non-human antibody. Generally, a humanized antibody comprises one or more variable domains in which HVRs, e.g., CDRs, (or portions thereof) are derived from a non-human antibody, and FRs (or portions thereof) are derived from human antibody sequences. A humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of a human constant region. In some embodiments, some FR residues in a humanized antibody are substituted with corresponding residues from a non-human antibody (e.g., the antibody from which the HVR residues are derived), e.g., to restore or improve antibody specificity or affinity. Humanized antibodies and methods of making them are reviewed, e.g., in Almagro, J.C. and Fransson, J., Front. Biosci. 13 (2008) 1619-1633, and are further described, e.g., in Riechmann, I. et al, Nature 332 (1988) 323-329; Queen, C. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 (1989) 10029-10033; US 5, 821,337, US 7,527,791, US 6,982,321, and US 7,087,409; Kashmiri, S.V. et al, Methods 36 (2005) 25-34 (describing specificity determining region (SDR) grafting); Padlan, E.A., Mol. Immunol. 28 (1991) 489-498 (describing "resurfacing"); Dall'Acqua, W.F. et al, Methods 36 (2005) 43-60 (describing "FR shuffling"); and Osbourn, J. et al, Methods 36 (2005) 61-68 and Klimka, A. et al, Br. J. Cancer 83 (2000) 252- 260 (describing the "guided selection" approach to FR shuffling). Human framework regions that may be used for humanization include but are not limited to: framework regions selected using the "best-fit" method (see, e.g., Sims, M.J. et al., J. Immunol. 151 (1993) 2296-2308; framework regions derived from the consensus sequence of human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chain variable regions (see, e.g., Carter, P. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 (1992) 4285-4289; and Presta, L.G. et al, J. Immunol. 151 (1993) 2623-2632); human mature (somatically mutated) framework regions or human germline framework regions (see, e.g., Almagro, J.C. and Fransson, J., Front. Biosci. 13 (2008) 1619-1633); and framework regions derived from screening FR libraries (see, e.g., Baca, M. et al, J. Biol. Chem. 272 (1997) 10678-10684 and Rosok, M.J. et al, J. Biol. Chem. 271 (19969 22611-22618). Human Antibodies In certain embodiments, an antibody analyzed in the method as reported herein is a human antibody. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art. Human antibodies are described generally in van Dijk, M.A. and van de Winkel, J.G., Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 5 (2001) 368-374 and Lonberg, N., Curr. Opin. Immunol. 20 (2008) 450-459. Human antibodies may be prepared by administering an immunogen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce intact human antibodies or intact antibodies with human variable regions in response to antigenic challenge. Such animals typically contain all or a portion of the human immunoglobulin loci, which replace the endogenous immunoglobulin loci, or which are present extrachromosomally or integrated randomly into the animal's chromosomes. In such transgenic mice, the endogenous immunoglobulin loci have generally been inactivated. For review of methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic animals, see Lonberg, N., Nat. Biotech. 23 (2005) 1117-1125. See also, e.g., US 6,075,181 and US 6,150,584 describing XENOMOUSEâ¢ technology; US 5,770,429 describing HuMabÂ® technology; US 7,041,870 describing K-M MOUSEÂ® technology, and US 2007/0061900, describing VelociMouseÂ® technology). Human variable regions from intact antibodies generated by such animals may be further modified, e.g., by combining with a different human constant region. Human antibodies can also be made by hybridoma-based methods. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described. (See, e.g., Kozbor, D., J. Immunol. 133 (1984) 3001-3005; Brodeur, B.R. et al, Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1987), pp. 51-63; and Boerner, P. et al, J. Immunol. 147 (1991) 86-95) Human antibodies generated via human B-cell hybridoma technology are also described in Li, J. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103 (2006) 3557-3562. Additional methods include those described, for example, in US 7,189,826 (describing production of monoclonal human IgM antibodies from hybridoma cell lines) and Ni, J., Xiandai Mianyixue 26 (2006) 265-268 (describing human-human hybridomas). Human hybridoma technology (Trioma technology) is also described in Vollmers, H.P. and Brandlein, S., Histology and Histopathology 20 (2005) 927-937 and Vollmers, H.P. and Brandlein, S., Methods and Findings in Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology 27 (2005) 185-191. Human antibodies may also be generated by isolating Fv clone variable domain sequences selected from human-derived phage display libraries. Such variable domain sequences may then be combined with a desired human constant domain. Techniques for selecting human antibodies from antibody libraries are described below. Library-Derived Antibodies Antibodies analyzed in the methods as reported herein may be isolated by screening combinatorial libraries for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example, a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are reviewed, e.g., in Hoogenboom, H.R. et al, Methods in Molecular Biology 178 (2001) 1-37 and further described, e.g., in the McCafferty, J. et al, Nature 348 (1990) 552-554; Clackson, T. et al, Nature 352 (1991) 624-628; Marks, J.D. et al, J. Mol. Biol. 222 (1992) 581-597; Marks, J.D. and Bradbury, A., Methods in Molecular Biology 248 (2003) 161-175; Sidhu, S.S. et al, J. Mol. Biol. 338 (2004) 299-310; Lee, C.V. et al, J. Mol. Biol. 340 (2004) 1073-1093; Fellouse, F.A., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101 (2004) 12467-12472; and Lee, C.V. et al, J. Immunol. Methods 284 (2004) 119-132. In certain phage display methods, repertoires of VH and VL genes are separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be screened for antigen-binding phage as described in Winter, G. et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol. 12 (1994) 433-455. Phage typically display antibody fragments, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments or as Fab fragments. Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned (e.g., from human) to provide a single source of antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths, A.D. et al, EMBO J. 12 (1993) 725-734. Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning non-rearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro, as described by Hoogenboom, H.R. and Winter, G., J. Mol. Biol. 227 (1992) 381-388. Patent publications describing human antibody phage libraries include, for example: US 5,750,373, and US 2005/0079574, US 2005/0119455, US 2005/0266000, US 2007/0117126, US 2007/0160598, US 2007/0237764, US 2007/0292936, and US 2009/0002360. Antibodies or antibody fragments isolated from human antibody libraries are considered human antibodies or human antibody fragments herein. Multispecific Antibodies Engineered proteins, such as bi- or multispecific antibodies capable of binding two or more antigens are known in the art. Such multispecific binding proteins can be generated using cell fusion, chemical conjugation, or recombinant DNA techniques. In certain embodiments, an antibody analyzed in the methods as reported herein is a multispecific antibody, e.g. at least a bispecific antibody. Multispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different sites. Multispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies. Techniques for making multispecific antibodies include, but are not limited to, recombinant co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs having different specificities (see Milstein, C. and Cuello, A.C., Nature 305 (1983) 537-540, WO 93/08829, and Traunecker, A. et al, EMBO J. 10 (1991) 3655- 3659), and "knob-in-hole" engineering (see, e.g., US 5,731,168). Multi-specific antibodies may also be made by engineering electrostatic steering effects for making antibody Fc-heterodimeric molecules (WO 2009/089004); cross-linking two or more antibodies or fragments (see, e.g., US 4,676,980, and Brennan, M. et al, Science 229 (1985) 81-83); using leucine zippers to produce bi-specific antibodies (see, e.g., Kostelny, S.A. et al, J. Immunol. 148 (1992) 1547-1553; using "diabody" technology for making bispecific antibody fragments (see, e.g., Holliger, P. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 (1993) 6444-6448); and using single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers (see, e.g. Gruber, M et al, J. Immunol. 152 (1994) 5368-5374); and preparing trispecific antibodies as described, e.g., in Tutt, A. et al, J. Immunol. 147 (1991) 60-69). Engineered antibodies with three or more functional antigen binding sites, including "Octopus antibodies," are also included herein (see, e.g. US 2006/0025576). The antibody or fragment herein also includes a "Dual Acting Fab" or "DAF" comprising an antigen binding site that binds to [[PRO]] as well as another, different antigen (see, US 2008/0069820, for example). The antibody or fragment herein also includes multispecific antibodies described in WO 2009/080251, WO 2009/080252, WO 2009/080253, WO 2009/080254, WO 2010/112193, WO 2010/115589, WO 2010/136172, WO 2010/145792, and WO 2010/145793. A wide variety of recombinant multispecific antibody formats have been developed in the recent past, e.g. tetravalent bispecific antibodies by fusion of, e.g. an IgG antibody format and single chain domains (see e.g. Coloma, M.J., et. al., Nature Biotech. 15 (1997) 159-163; WO 2001/077342; and Morrison, S.L., Nature Biotech. 25 (2007) 1233-1234. Also several other new formats wherein the antibody core structure (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG or IgM) is no longer retained such as dia-, tria- or tetrabodies, minibodies, several single chain formats (scFv, Bis-scFv), which are capable of binding two or more antigens, have been developed (Holliger, P., et. al, Nature Biotech. 23 (2005) 1126-1136; Fischer, N., and Leger, O., Pathobiology 74 (2007) 3-14; Shen, J., et. al, J. Immunol. Methods 318 (2007) 65-74; Wu, C, et al, Nature Biotech. 25 (2007) 1290-1297). All such formats use linkers either to fuse the antibody core (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG or IgM) to a further binding protein (e.g. scFv) or to fuse e.g. two Fab fragments or scFv (Fischer, N., and Leger, O., Pathobiology 74 (2007) 3-14). While it is obvious that linkers have advantages for the engineering of multispecific antibodies, they may also cause problems in therapeutic settings. Indeed, these foreign peptides might elicit an immune response against the linker itself or the junction between the protein and the linker. Furthermore, the flexible nature of these peptides makes them more prone to proteolytic cleavage, potentially leading to poor antibody stability, aggregation and increased immunogenicity. In addition one may want to retain effector functions, such as e.g. complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which are mediated through the Fc-part by maintaining a high degree of similarity to naturally occurring antibodies. Thus, ideally, one should aim at developing multispecific antibodies that are very similar in general structure to naturally occurring antibodies (like IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG or IgM) with minimal deviation from human sequences. In one approach bispecific antibodies that are very similar to natural antibodies have been produced using the quadroma technology (see Milstein, C, and Cuello, A.C., Nature 305 (1983) 537-540) based on the somatic fusion of two different hybridoma cell lines expressing murine monoclonal antibodies with the desired specificities of the bispecific antibody. Because of the random pairing of two different antibody heavy and light chains within the resulting hybrid-hybridoma (or quadroma) cell line, up to ten different antibody species are generated of which only one is the desired, functional bispecific antibody. Due to the presence of mispaired byproducts, and significantly reduced production yields, sophisticated purification procedures are required (see e.g. Morrison, S.L., Nature Biotech. 25 (2007) 1233-1234). In general the same problem of mispaired by-products remains if recombinant expression techniques are used. An approach to circumvent the problem of mispaired byproducts, which is known as 'knobs-into-holes', aims at forcing the pairing of two different antibody heavy chains by introducing mutations into the CH3 domains to modify the contact interface. On one chain bulky amino acids were replaced by amino acids with short side chains to create a 'hole'. Conversely, amino acids with large side chains were introduced into the other CH3 domain, to create a 'knob'. By co-expressing these two heavy chains (and two identical light chains, which have to be appropriate for both heavy chains), high yields of heterodimer formation ('knob-hole') versus homodimer formation ('hole-hole' or 'knob-knob') was observed (Ridgway, J.B., et al, Protein Eng. 9 (1996) 617-621; and WO 96/027011). The percentage of heterodimer could be further increased by remodeling the interaction surfaces of the two CH3 domains using a phage display approach and the introduction of a disulfide bridge to stabilize the heterodimers (Merchant, A.M., et al., Nature Biotech. 16 (1998) 677-681; Atwell, S., et al, J. Mol. Biol. 270 (1997) 26-35). New approaches for the knobs-into-holes technology are described in e.g. in EP 1 870 459 Al . Although this format appears very attractive, no data describing progression towards the clinic are currently available. One important constraint of this strategy is that the light chains of the two parent antibodies have to be identical to prevent mispairing and formation of inactive molecules. Thus this technique is not appropriate as a basis for easily developing recombinant, tri-or tetraspecific antibodies against three or four antigens starting from two antibodies against the first and the second antigen, as either the heavy chains of these antibodies and/or the identical light chains have to be optimized first and then further antigen binding peptides against the third and fourth antigen have to be added. WO 2006/093794 relates to heterodimeric protein binding compositions. WO 99/37791 describes multipurpose antibody derivatives. Morrison, S.L., et al, J. Immunol. 160 (1998) 2802-2808 refers to the influence of variable region domain exchange on the functional properties of IgG. WO 2013/02362 relates to heterodimerized polypeptides. WO 2013/12733 relates to polypeptides comprising heterodimeric Fc regions. WO 2012/131555 relates to engineered hetero-dimeric immunoglobulins. EP 2647707 relates to engineered hetero-dimeric immunoglobulins. WO 2013/026835 relates to bispecific, Fc free antibodies with a domain crossover. WO 2009/080251, WO 2009/080252, WO 2009/080253, WO 2009/080254 and Schaefer, W. et al, PNAS, 108 (2011) 11187-1191 relate to bivalent, bispecific IgG antibodies with a domain crossover. The multispecific antibodies with VH/VL replacement/exchange in one binding to prevent light chain mispairing (CrossMabVH-VL) which are described in WO2009/080252, (see also Schaefer, W. et al, PNAS, 108 (2011) 11187-1 191) clearly reduce the byproducts caused by the mismatch of a light chain against a first antigen with the wrong heavy chain against the second antigen (compared to approaches without such domain exchange). However their preparation is not completely free of side products. The main side product is based on a Bence- Jones- type interaction (see also Schaefer, W. et al, PNAS, 108 (2011) 11187-1191; in Fig. S1I of the Supplement).

One aspect as reported herein is a bispecific antibody comprising a) a full length antibody specifically binding to a first antigen and consisting of two antibody heavy chains and two antibody light chains, and b) an Fv fragment specifically binding to a second antigen comprising a VH2 domain and a VL2 domain, wherein both domains are connected to each other via a disulfide bridge, wherein only either the VH2 domain or the VL2 domain is fused via a peptidic linker to the heavy or light chain of the full length antibody specifically binding to a first antigen, wherein the first and the second antigen are different antigens. In the bispecific the heavy chains and the light chains under a) are isolated chains. In one embodiment the other of the VH2 domain or the VL2 domain is not fused via a peptide linker to the heavy or light chain of the full length antibody specifically binding to a first antigen. In all aspects as reported herein the first light chain comprises a VL domain and a CL domain and the first heavy chain comprises a VH domain, a CHI domain, a hinge region, a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain. In one embodiment of all aspects the antibody as reported herein is a multispecific antibody, which requires heterodimerization of at least two heavy chain polypeptides. Several approaches for CH3 -modifications in order to support heterodimerization have been described, for example in WO 96/27011, WO 98/050431, EP 1870459, WO 2007/110205, WO 2007/147901, WO 2009/089004, WO 2010/129304, WO 2011/90754, WO 2011/143545, WO 2012/058768, WO 2013/157954, WO 2013/096291, which are herein included by reference. Typically, in the approaches known in the art, the CH3 domain of the first heavy chain and the CH3 domain of the second heavy chain are both engineered in a complementary manner so that the heavy chain comprising one engineered CH3 domain can no longer homodimerize with another heavy chain of the same structure (e.g. a CH3- engineered first heavy chain can no longer homodimerize with another CH3- engineered first heavy chain; and a CH3 -engineered second heavy chain can no longer homodimerize with another CH3 -engineered second heavy chain). Thereby the heavy chain comprising one engineered CH3 domain is forced to heterodimerize with another heavy chain comprising the CH3 domain, which is engineered in a complementary manner. For this embodiment of the invention, the CH3 domain of the first heavy chain and the CH3 domain of the second heavy chain are engineered in a complementary manner by amino acid substitutions, such that the first heavy chain and the second heavy chain are forced to heterodimerize, whereas the first heavy chain and the second heavy chain can no longer homodimerize (e.g. for steric reasons). The different approaches for supporting heavy chain heterodimerization known in the art, that were cited and included above, are contemplated as different alternatives used in a multispecific antibody according to the invention, which comprises a "non-crossed Fab region" derived from a first antibody, which specifically binds to a first antigen, and a "crossed Fab region" derived from a second antibody, which specifically binds to a second antigen, in combination with the particular amino acid substitutions described above for the invention. The CH3 domains of the multispecific antibody as reported herein can be altered by the "knob-into-holes" technology which is described in detail with several examples in e.g. WO 96/027011, Ridgway, J.B., et al, Protein Eng. 9 (1996) 617- 621; and Merchant, A.M., et al, Nat. Biotechnol. 16 (1998) 677-681. In this method the interaction surfaces of the two CH3 domains are altered to increase the heterodimerization of both heavy chains containing these two CH3 domains. Each of the two CH3 domains (of the two heavy chains) can be the "knob", while the other is the "hole". The introduction of a disulfide bridge further stabilizes the heterodimers (Merchant, A.M., et al, Nature Biotech. 16 (1998) 677-681; Atwell, S., et al, J. Mol. Biol. 270 (1997) 26-35) and increases the yield. In one preferred embodiment the multispecific antibody as reported herein comprises a T366W mutation in the CH3 domain of the "knobs chain" and T366S, L368A, Y407V mutations in the CH3 domain of the "hole-chain" (numbering according to Kabat EU index). An additional interchain disulfide bridge between the CH3 domains can also be used (Merchant, A.M., et al., Nature Biotech. 16 (1998) 677-681) e.g. by introducing a Y349C mutation into the CH3 domain of the "knobs chain" and a E356C mutation or a S354C mutation into the CH3 domain of the "hole chain". Thus in a another preferred embodiment, the multispecific antibody as reported herein comprises the Y349C and T366W mutations in one of the two CH3 domains and the E356C, T366S, L368A and Y407V mutations in the other of the two CH3 domains or the multispecific antibody as reported herein comprises the Y349C and T366W mutations in one of the two CH3 domains and the S354C, T366S, L368A and Y407V mutations in the other of the two CH3 domains (the additional Y349C mutation in one CH3 domain and the additional E356C or S354C mutation in the other CH3 domain forming a interchain disulfide bridge) (numbering according to Kabat EU index). But also other knobs-in-holes technologies as described by EP 1 870 459A1, can be used alternatively or additionally. In one embodiment the multispecific antibody as reported herein comprises the R409D and K370E mutations in the CH3 domain of the "knobs chain" and the D399K and E357K mutations in the CH3 domain of the "hole-chain" (numbering according to Kabat EU index). In one embodiment the multispecific antibody as reported herein comprises a T366W mutation in the CH3 domain of the "knobs chain" and the T366S, L368A and Y407V mutations in the CH3 domain of the "hole chain" and additionally the R409D and K370E mutations in the CH3 domain of the "knobs chain" and the D399K and E357K mutations in the CH3 domain of the "hole chain" (numbering according to the Kabat EU index). In one embodiment the multispecific antibody as reported herein comprises the Y349C and T366W mutations in one of the two CH3 domains and the S354C, T366S, L368A and Y407V mutations in the other of the two CH3 domains, or the multispecific antibody as reported herein comprises the Y349C and T366W mutations in one of the two CH3 domains and the S354C, T366S, L368A and Y407V mutations in the other of the two CH3 domains and additionally the R409D and K370E mutations in the CH3 domain of the "knobs chain" and the D399K and E357K mutations in the CH3 domain of the "hole chain" (numbering according to the Kabat EU index). Apart from the "knob-into-hole technology" other techniques for modifying the CH3 domains of the heavy chains of a multispecific antibody to enforce heterodimerization are known in the art. These technologies, especially the ones described in WO 96/27011, WO 98/050431, EP 1870459, WO 2007/110205, WO 2007/147901, WO 2009/089004, WO 2010/129304, WO 2011/90754, WO 2011/143545, WO 2012/058768, WO 2013/157954 and WO 2013/096291 are contemplated herein as alternatives to the "knob-into-hole technology" in combination with a multispecific antibody as reported herein.

Recombinant Methods and Compositions Antibodies may be produced using recombinant methods and compositions, e.g., as described in US 4,816,567. The required nucleic acid may encode an amino acid sequence comprising the VL and/or an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody (e.g., the light and/or heavy chains of the antibody). In a further embodiment, one or more vectors (e.g., expression vectors) comprising such nucleic acid are provided. In a further embodiment, a host cell comprising such nucleic acid is provided. In one such embodiment, a host cell comprises (e.g., has been transformed with): (1) a vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VL of the antibody and an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody, or (2) a first vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VL of the antibody and a second vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody. In one embodiment, the host cell is eukaryotic, e.g. a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell or lymphoid cell (e.g., Y0, NSO, Sp20 cell). In one embodiment, a method of making an anti-[[PRO]] antibody is provided, wherein the method comprises culturing a host cell comprising a nucleic acid encoding the antibody, as provided above, under conditions suitable for expression of the antibody, and optionally recovering the antibody from the host cell (or host cell culture medium). For recombinant production of an antibody, nucleic acid encoding an antibody, e.g., as described above, is isolated and inserted into one or more vectors for further cloning and/or expression in a host cell. Such nucleic acid may be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Suitable host cells for cloning or expression of antibody-encoding vectors include prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells described herein. For example, antibodies may be produced in bacteria, in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria, see, e.g., US 5,648,237, US 5,789,199, and US 5,840,523. (See also Charlton, K.A., In: Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 248, Lo, B.K.C. (ed.), Humana Press, Totowa, NJ (2003), pp. 245-254, describing expression of antibody fragments in E. coli.) After expression, the antibody may be isolated from the bacterial cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be further purified. In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody-encoding vectors, including fungi and yeast strains whose glycosylation pathways have been "humanized," resulting in the production of an antibody with a partially or fully human glycosylation pattern. See Gerngross, T.U., Nat. Biotech. 22 (2004) 1409-1414; and Li, H. et al, Nat. Biotech. 24 (2006) 210-215. Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibody are also derived from multicellular organisms (invertebrates and vertebrates). Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains have been identified which may be used in conjunction with insect cells, particularly for transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Plant cell cultures can also be utilized as hosts. See, e.g., US 5,959,177, US 6,040,498, US 6,420,548, US 7,125,978, and US 6,417,429 (describing PLANTIBODIESâ¢ technology for producing antibodies in transgenic plants). Vertebrate cells may also be used as hosts. For example, mammalian cell lines that are adapted to grow in suspension may be useful. Other examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells as described, e.g., in Graham, F.L. et al, J. Gen Virol. 36 (1977) 59-74); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK); mouse Sertoli cells (TM4 cells as described, e.g., in Mather, J.P., Biol. Reprod. 23 (1980) 243-252); monkey kidney cells (CV1); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA); canine kidney cells (MDCK; buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3 A); human lung cells (W138); human liver cells (Hep G2); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562); TRI cells, as described, e.g., in Mather, J.P. et al, Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci. 383 (1982) 44-68; MRC 5 cells; and FS4 cells. Other useful mammalian host cell lines include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, including DHFR" CHO cells (Urlaub, G. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 (1980) 4216-4220); and myeloma cell lines such as Y0, NSO and Sp2/0.

The DNA sequences of the subcloned gene fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Gene synthesis fragments were ordered according to given specifications at Geneart (Regensburg, Germany). DNA sequence determination DNA sequences were determined by double strand sequencing performed at MediGenomix GmbH (Martinsried, Germany) or SequiServe GmbH (Vaterstetten, Germany). DNA and protein sequence analysis and sequence data management The GCG's (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wisconsin) software package version 10.2 and Infomax's Vector NTl Advance suite version 8.0 was used for sequence creation, mapping, analysis, annotation and illustration. Expression vectors For the expression of the described antibodies, variants of expression plasmids for transient expression (e.g. in HEK293 EBNA or HEK293-F) cells based either on a cDNA organization with or without a CMV-Intron A promoter or on a genomic organization with a CMV promoter were applied. Beside the antibody expression cassette the vectors contained: - an origin of replication which allows replication of this plasmid in E. coli, and - a Î²-lactamase gene which confers ampicillin resistance in E. coli. The transcription unit of the antibody gene was composed of the following elements: - unique restriction site(s) at the 5 ' end - the immediate early enhancer and promoter from the human cytomegalovirus, - followed by the Intron A sequence in the case of the cDNA organization, - a 5 '-untranslated region of a human antibody gene, - an immunoglobulin heavy chain signal sequence, - the human antibody chain (wildtype or with domain exchange) either as cDNA or as genomic organization with the immunoglobulin exon-intron organization - a 3 ' untranslated region with a polyadenylation signal sequence, and - unique restriction site(s) at the 3 ' end. The fusion genes comprising the antibody chains as described below were generated by PCR and/or gene synthesis and assembled by known recombinant methods and techniques by connection of the according nucleic acid segments e.g. using unique restriction sites in the respective vectors. The subcloned nucleic acid sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. For transient transfections larger quantities of the plasmids were prepared by plasmid preparation from transformed E. coli cultures (Nucleobond AX, Macherey-Nagel). Cell culture techniques Standard cell culture techniques were used as described in Current Protocols in Cell Biology (2000), Bonifacino, J.S., Dasso, M., Harford, J.B., Lippincott- Schwartz, J. and Yamada, K.M. (eds.), John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Multispecific antibodies were expressed by transient co-transfection of the respective expression plasmids in adherently growing HEK293-EBNA or in HEK29-F cells growing in suspension as described below. Transient transfections in HEK293-EBNA system Multispecific antibodies were expressed by transient co-transfection of the respective expression plasmids (e.g. encoding the heavy and modified heavy chain, as well as the corresponding light and modified light chain) in adherently growing HEK293-EBNA cells (human embryonic kidney cell line 293 expressing Epstein- Barr- Virus nuclear antigen; American type culture collection deposit number ATCC # CRL-10852, Lot. 959 218) cultivated in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, GibcoÂ®) supplemented with 10% Ultra Low IgG FCS (fetal calf serum, GibcoÂ®), 2 mM L-Glutamine (GibcoÂ®), and 250 Î¼g/ml Geneticin (GibcoÂ®). For transfection FuGENEâ¢ 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used in a ratio of FuGENEâ¢ reagent (Î¼Î) to DNA ^g) of 4: 1 (ranging from 3: 1 to 6:1). Proteins were expressed from the respective plasmids using a molar ratio of (modified and wildtype) light chain and heavy chain encoding plasmids of 1 : 1 (equimolar) ranging from 1 :2 to 2: 1, respectively. Cells were fed at day 3 with L-Glutamine ad 4 mM, Glucose [Sigma] and NAA [GibcoÂ®]. Multispecific antibody containing cell culture supernatants were harvested from day 5 to 11 after transfection by centrifugation and stored at -20Â°C. General information regarding the recombinant expression of human immunoglobulins in e.g. HEK293 cells is given in: Meissner, P. et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 75 (2001) 197-203. Transient trans fections in HEK293-F system Multispecific antibodies were generated by transient transfection with the respective plasmids (e.g. encoding the heavy and modified heavy chain, as well as the corresponding light and modified light chain) using the HEK293-F system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, HEK293-F cells (Invitrogen) growing in suspension either in a shake flask or in a stirred fermenter in serum-free FreeStyleâ¢ 293 expression medium (Invitrogen) were transfected with a mix of the four expression plasmids and 293fectinâ¢ or fectin (Invitrogen). For 2 L shake flask (Corning) HEK293-F cells were seeded at a density of 1.0E*6 cells/mL in 600 mL and incubated at 120 rpm, 8% C02. The day after the cells were transfected at a cell density of ca. 1.5E*6 cells/mL with ca. 42 mL mix of A) 20 mL Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with 600 Î¼g total plasmid DNA (1 Î¼g/mL) encoding the heavy or modified heavy chain, respectively and the corresponding light chain in an equimolar ratio and B) 20 ml Opti-MEM + 1.2 mL 293 fectin or fectin (2 Î¼Î/mL). According to the glucose consumption glucose solution was added during the course of the fermentation. The supernatant containing the secreted antibody was harvested after 5-10 days and antibodies were either directly purified from the supernatant or the supernatant was frozen and stored. Protein determination The protein concentration of purified antibodies and derivatives was determined by determining the optical density (OD) at 280 nm, using the molar extinction coefficient calculated on the basis of the amino acid sequence according to Pace, et al., Protein Science, 1995, 4, 2411-1423. Antibody concentration determination in supernatants The concentration of antibodies and derivatives in cell culture supernatants was estimated by immunoprecipitation with Protein A Agarose-beads (Roche). 60 Î¼Î^ Protein A Agarose beads were washed three times in TBS-NP40 (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet-P40). Subsequently, 1-15 mL cell culture supernatant was applied to the Protein A Agarose beads pre-equilibrated in TBS- NP40. After incubation for at 1 hour at room temperature the beads were washed on an Ultrafree-MC-filter column (Amicon) once with 0.5 mL TBS-NP40, twice with 0.5 mL 2x phosphate buffered saline (2xPBS, Roche) and briefly four times with 0.5 mL 100 mM Na-citrate pH 5,0. Bound antibody was eluted by addition of 35 Î¼Î NuPAGEÂ® LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen). Half of the sample was combined with NuPAGEÂ® Sample Reducing Agent or left unreduced, respectively, and heated for 10 min at 70Â°C. Consequently, 5-30 Î¼Î were applied to a 4-12% NuPAGEÂ® Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) (with MOPS buffer for non-reduced SDS-PAGE and MES buffer with NuPAGEÂ® Antioxidant running buffer additive (Invitrogen) for reduced SDS-PAGE) and stained with Coomassie Blue. The concentration of antibodies and derivatives in cell culture supernatants was quantitatively measured by affinity HPLC chromatography. Briefly, cell culture supernatants containing antibodies and derivatives that bind to Protein A were applied to an Applied Biosystems Poros A/20 column in 200 mM KH2P04, 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.4 and eluted from the matrix with 200 mM NaCl, 100 mM citric acid, pH 2,5 on an Agilent HPLC 1100 system. The eluted protein was quantified by UV absorbance and integration of peak areas. A purified standard IgGl antibody served as a standard. Alternatively, the concentration of antibodies and derivatives in cell culture supernatants was measured by Sandwich-IgG-ELISA. Briefly, StreptaWell High Bind Streptavidin A-96 well microtiter plates (Roche) are coated with 100 Î¼ÎÎÎ½ÎµÎÎ biotinylated anti-human IgG capture molecule F(ab')2<h-Fcy> BI (Dianova) at 0.1 Î¼g/mL for 1 hour at room temperature or alternatively overnight at 4Â°C and subsequently washed three times with 200 Î¼ÎÎÎ½ÎµÎÎ PBS, 0.05% Tween (PBST, Sigma). 100 Î¼ÎÎÎ½ÎµÎÎ of a dilution series in PBS (Sigma) of the respective antibody containing cell culture supernatants was added to the wells and incubated for 1-2 hour on a microtiterplate shaker at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with 200 Î¼ÎÎÎ½ÎµÎÎ PBST and bound antibody was detected with 100 Î¼Î F(ab')2<hFcy>POD (Dianova) at 0.1 Î¼g/mL as the detection antibody for 1-2 hours on a micro-titerplate shaker at room temperature. Unbound detection antibody was washed away three times with 200 Î¼ÎÎÎ½ÎµÎÎ PBST and the bound detection antibody was detected by addition of 100 Î¼Î^ ABTS/well. Determination of absorbance was performed on a Tecan Fluor Spectrometer at a measurement wavelength of 405 nm (reference wavelength 492 nm). Protein purification Proteins were purified from filtered cell culture supematants referring to standard protocols. In brief, antibodies were applied to a Protein A Sepharose column (GE healthcare) and washed with PBS. Elution of antibodies was achieved at pH 2.8 followed by immediate neutralization of the sample. Aggregated protein was separated from monomeric antibodies by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) in PBS or in 20 mM Histidine, 150 mM NaCl pH 6.0. Monomeric antibody fractions were pooled, concentrated (if required) using e.g., a MILLIPORE Amicon Ultra (30 MWCO) centrifugal concentrator, frozen and stored at -20Â°C or -80Â°C. Part of the samples were provided for subsequent protein analytics and analytical characterization e.g. by SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or mass spectrometry. SDS-PAGE The NuPAGEÂ® Pre-Cast gel system (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instruction. In particular, 10% or 4-12% NuPAGEÂ® No vexÂ® Bis- TRIS Pre-Cast gels (pH 6.4) and a NuPAGEÂ® MES (reduced gels, with NuPAGEÂ® Antioxidant running buffer additive) or MOPS (non-reduced gels) running buffer was used. Analytical size exclusion chromatography Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for the determination of the aggregation and oligomeric state of antibodies was performed by HPLC chromatography. Briefly, Protein A purified antibodies were applied to a Tosoh TSKgel G3000SW column in 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.5 on an Agilent HPLC 1100 system or to a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 2 x PBS on a Dionex HPLC-System. The eluted protein was quantified by UV absorbance and integration of peak areas. BioRad Gel Filtration Standard 151-1901 served as a standard.
