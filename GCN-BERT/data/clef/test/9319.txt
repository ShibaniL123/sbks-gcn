Example 454
[1-{[3-(2-Methoxypropyl)-5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1-(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl]methyl}imidazolidin-2-ylidene]cyanamide (racemate)
650 mg (1.23 mmol, 80% purity) of the compound from Ex. 458A were dissolved in 12 ml of DMF, and 270 mg (1.85 mmol) of dimethyl N-cyanodithioiminocarbonate and 340 mg (2.46 mmol) of potassium carbonate were added. The mixture was stirred at 80Â° C. in a microwave oven (Biotage Initiator with dynamic control of irradiation power) for 4 h. The reaction mixture was then concentrated to dryness and the residue was separated into its components by means of preparative HPLC (Method 8). The product fractions were combined and concentrated. 317 mg (54% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
