Example 4 (Reference)
(S)-4-Amino-2-(6-oxopiperidin-3-yl)isoindoline-1,3-dione (30). To a mixture of 3-amino phthalic acid hydrochloride (0.144 g, 0.664 mmol) and (S)-5-aminopiperidin-2-one hydrochloride (0.100 g, 0.664 mmol) in dry DMF (2.2 mL) was added triethylamine (0.933 mL, 6.64 mmol) and the reaction mixture was heated at 80 Â°C over 18 h. The crude mixture was quenched by the addition of a saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution (30 mL) and extracted using DCM (3x20 mL). Combined organic phases were dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated. The crude residue was purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC to give the desired product 30 (0.08 g, 47%) as an off-white powder.
