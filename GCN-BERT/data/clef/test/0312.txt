Field of the Invention The present invention relates to polypeptides having glucoamylase activity and polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides. The invention also relates to nucleic acid constructs, vectors, and host cells comprising the polynucleotides as well as methods for producing and using the polypeptides, and to the use of glucoamylases of the invention for starch conversion to producing fermentation products, such as ethanol, and syrups, such as glucose. The invention also relates to a composition comprising a glucoamylase of the invention. 2. Description of the Related Art Glucoamylase (1,4-alpha-D-glucan glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.3) is an enzyme, which catalyzes the release of D-glucose from the non-reducing ends of starch or related oligo- and polysaccharide molecules. Glucoamylases are produced by several filamentous fungi and yeast, with those from Aspergillus being commercially most important. Commercially, glucoamylases are used to convert starchy material, which is already partially hydrolyzed by an alpha-amylase, to glucose. The glucose may then be converted directly or indirectly into a fermentation product using a fermenting organism. Examples of commercial fermentation products include alcohols (e.g., ethanol, methanol, butanol, 1,3-propanediol); organic acids (e.g., citric acid, acetic acid, itaconic acid, lactic acid, gluconic acid, gluconate, lactic acid, succinic acid, 2,5-diketo-D-gluconic acid); ketones (e.g., acetone); amino acids (e.g., glutamic acid); gases (e.g., H2 and CO2), and more complex compounds, including, for example, antibiotics (e.g., penicillin and tetracycline); enzymes; vitamins (e.g., riboflavin, B12, beta-carotene); hormones, and other compounds which are difficult to produce synthetically. Fermentation processes are also commonly used in the consumable alcohol (e.g., beer and wine). The end product may also be a syrup. For instance, the end product may be glucose, but may also be converted, e.g., by a glucose isomerase to fructose or a mixture composed almost equally of glucose and fructose. This mixture, or a mixture further enriched with fructose, is the most commonly used high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) commercialized throughout the world. It is an object of the present invention to provide polypeptides having glucoamylase activity and polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides and which provide a high yield in fermentation product production processes, such as ethanol production processes, including one-step ethanol fermentation processes from un-gelatinized raw (or uncooked) starch. Uniprot: B0CVJ1 discloses a polypeptide from Laccaria bicolor and WO 2006/069289 describes a glucoamylase from Trametes cingulata.

Mature polypeptide: The term “mature polypeptide” means a polypeptide in its final form following translation and any post-translational modifications, such as N-terminal processing, C-terminal truncation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, etc. In one aspect, the mature polypeptide is amino acids 19 to 573 of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, or SEQ ID NO: 6 based on the SignalP program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1-6) that predicts amino acids 1 to 18 of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, and SEQ ID NO: 6 are signal peptides. Preferably, the mature polypeptide is amino acids 19 to 573 of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, or SEQ ID NO: 6. The sequence defined by amino acids 22 to 476 of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, and SEQ ID NO: 6 is the catalytic domain. The sequence defined by amino acids 479 to 573 of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, and SEQ ID NO: 6 is a starch binding domain. Mature polypeptide coding sequence: The term “mature polypeptide coding sequence” is defined herein as a nucleotide sequence that encodes a mature polypeptide having glucoamylase activity. Preferably, the mature polypeptide coding sequence is nucleotides defined by positions 55 to 159, 229 to 505, 573 to 877, 932 to 1207, 1269 to 1731, 1800 to 1895, 1962 to 2104 of SEQ ID NO: 1, or defined by positions 55 to 159, 229 to 504, 571 to 876, 942 to 1217, 1276 to 1738, 1806 to 1901, 1960 to 2102 of SEQ ID NO: 3 or of SEQ ID NO: 5. Identity: The relatedness between two amino acid sequences or between two nucleotide sequences is described by the parameter “identity”. For purposes of the present invention, the degree of identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000, Trends in Genetics 16: 276-277), preferably version 3.0.0 or later. The optional parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 (EMBOSS version of BLOSUM62) substitution matrix. The output of Needle labeled “longest identity” (obtained using the—nobrief option) is used as the percent identity and is calculated as follows: [in-line-formulae](Identical Residues×100)/(Length of Alignment−Total Number of Gaps in Alignment)[/in-line-formulae] For purposes of the present invention, the degree of identity between two deoxyribonucleotide sequences is determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, supra) as implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000, supra), preferably version 3.0.0 or later. The optional parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EDNAFULL (EMBOSS version of NCBI NUC4.4) substitution matrix. The output of Needle labeled “longest identity” (obtained using the—nobrief option) is used as the percent identity and is calculated as follows: [in-line-formulae](Identical Deoxyribonucleotides×100)/(Length of Alignment−Total Number of Gaps in Alignment)[/in-line-formulae] Homologous sequence: The term “homologous sequence” is defined herein as a nucleotide sequence/polypeptide sequence having a degree of identity to the mature polypeptide encoding part of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5 or to the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6, respectively, of at least 90%, more preferably at least 91%, more preferably at least 92%, even more preferably at least 93%, most preferably at least 94%, and even most preferably at least 95%, such as at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or even at least 99%. Polypeptide fragment: The term “polypeptide fragment” is defined herein as a polypeptide having one or more (several) amino acids deleted from the amino and/or carboxyl terminus of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6; or a homologous sequence thereof; wherein the fragment has glucoamylase activity. Preferably, a fragment contains at least 500 amino acid residues, more preferably at least 450 amino acid, and most preferably at least 400 amino acid residues, of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6, or a homologous sequence thereof. A particular fragment is the sequence defined by amino acids 22 to 476 of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6 which comprise the catalytic domain of the polypeptide of the invention. Subsequence: The term “subsequence” is defined herein as a nucleotide sequence having one or more (several) nucleotides deleted from the 5′ and/or 3′ end of the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5; or a homologous sequence thereof; wherein the subsequence encodes a polypeptide fragment having glucoamylase activity. Preferably, a subsequence contains at least 1500 nucleotides, more preferably at least 1400 nucleotides, and most preferably at least 1200 nucleotides of the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, of SEQ ID NO: 3 or of SEQ ID NO: 5; or a homologous sequence thereof. Allelic variant: The term “allelic variant” denotes herein any of two or more alternative forms of a gene occupying the same chromosomal locus. Allelic variation arises naturally through mutation, and may result in polymorphism within populations. Gene mutations can be silent (no change in the encoded polypeptide) or may encode polypeptides having altered amino acid sequences. An allelic variant of a polypeptide is a polypeptide encoded by an allelic variant of a gene. Isolated polynucleotide: The term “isolated polynucleotide” as used herein refers to a polynucleotide that is isolated from a source. Preferably, the polynucleotide is at least 1% pure, preferably at least 5% pure, more preferably at least 10% pure, more preferably at least 20% pure, more preferably at least 40% pure, more preferably at least 60% pure, even more preferably at least 80% pure, and most preferably at least 90% pure, as determined by agarose electrophoresis. Substantially pure polynucleotide: The term “substantially pure polynucleotide” as used herein refers to a polynucleotide preparation free of other extraneous or unwanted nucleotides and in a form suitable for use within genetically engineered protein production systems. Thus, a substantially pure polynucleotide contains at most 10%, preferably at most 8%, more preferably at most 6%, more preferably at most 5%, more preferably at most 4%, more preferably at most 3%, even more preferably at most 2%, most preferably at most 1%, and even most preferably at most 0.5% by weight of other polynucleotide material with which it is natively or recombinantly associated. A substantially pure polynucleotide may, however, include naturally occurring 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions, such as promoters and terminators. It is preferred that the substantially pure polynucleotide is at least 90% pure, preferably at least 92% pure, more preferably at least 94% pure, more preferably at least 95% pure, more preferably at least 96% pure, more preferably at least 97% pure, even more preferably at least 98% pure, most preferably at least 99%, and even most preferably at least 99.5% pure by weight. The polynucleotides of the present invention are preferably in a substantially pure form, i.e., that the polynucleotide preparation is essentially free of other polynucleotide material with which it is natively or recombinantly associated. The polynucleotides may be of genomic, cDNA, RNA, semisynthetic, synthetic origin, or any combinations thereof. Coding sequence: When used herein the term “coding sequence” means a nucleotide sequence, which directly specifies the amino acid sequence of its protein product. The boundaries of the coding sequence are generally determined by an open reading frame, which usually begins with the ATG start codon or alternative start codons such as GTG and TTG and ends with a stop codon such as TAA, TAG, and TGA. The coding sequence may be a DNA, cDNA, synthetic, or recombinant nucleotide sequence. cDNA: The term “cDNA” is defined herein as a DNA molecule that can be prepared by reverse transcription from a mature, spliced, mRNA molecule obtained from a eukaryotic cell. cDNA lacks intron sequences that are usually present in the corresponding genomic DNA. The initial, primary RNA transcript is a precursor to mRNA that is processed through a series of steps before appearing as mature spliced mRNA. These steps include the removal of intron sequences by a process called splicing. cDNA derived from mRNA lacks, therefore, any intron sequences. Nucleic acid construct: The term “nucleic acid construct” as used herein refers to a nucleic acid molecule, either single- or double-stranded, which is isolated from a naturally occurring gene or which is modified to contain segments of nucleic acids in a manner that would not otherwise exist in nature or which is synthetic. The term nucleic acid construct is synonymous with the term “expression cassette” when the nucleic acid construct contains the control sequences required for expression of a coding sequence of the present invention. Control sequences: The term “control sequences” is defined herein to include all components necessary for the expression of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention. Each control sequence may be native or foreign to the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide or native or foreign to each other. Such control sequences include, but are not limited to, a leader, polyadenylation sequence, propeptide sequence, promoter, signal peptide sequence, and transcription terminator. At a minimum, the control sequences include a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The control sequences may be provided with linkers for the purpose of introducing specific restriction sites facilitating ligation of the control sequences with the coding region of the nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide. Operably linked: The term “operably linked” denotes herein a configuration in which a control sequence is placed at an appropriate position relative to the coding sequence of the polynucleotide sequence such that the control sequence directs the expression of the coding sequence of a polypeptide. Expression: The term “expression” includes any step involved in the production of the polypeptide including, but not limited to, transcription, post-transcriptional modification, translation, post-translational modification, and secretion. Expression vector: The term “expression vector” is defined herein as a linear or circular DNA molecule that comprises a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention and is operably linked to additional nucleotides that provide for its expression. Host cell: The term “host cell”, as used herein, includes any cell type that is susceptible to transformation, transfection, transduction, and the like with a nucleic acid construct or expression vector comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention. Modification: The term “modification” means herein any chemical modification of the polypeptide consisting of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6; or a homologous sequence thereof; as well as genetic manipulation of the DNA encoding such a polypeptide. The modification can be a substitution, a deletion and/or an insertion of one or more (several) amino acids as well as replacements of one or more (several) amino acid side chains. Variant: When used herein, the term “variant” means a polypeptide having glucoamylase activity comprising an alteration, i.e., a substitution, insertion, and/or deletion of one or more (several) amino acid residues at one or more (several) positions. A substitution means a replacement of an amino acid occupying a position with a different amino acid; a deletion means removal of an amino acid occupying a position; and an insertion means adding 1-3 amino acids adjacent to an amino acid occupying a position. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Polypeptides Having Glucoamylase Activity In a first aspect, the present invention relates to isolated polypeptides comprising an amino acid sequence having a degree of identity to the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6 of preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 91%, more preferably at least 92%, even more preferably at least 93%, most preferably at least 94%, and even most preferably at least 95%, such as at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or even 100% identity, which have glucoamylase activity (hereinafter “homologous polypeptides”). Preferably, the homologous polypeptides have an amino acid sequence that differs by ten amino acids, preferably by five amino acids, more preferably by four amino acids, even more preferably by three amino acids, most preferably by two amino acids, and even most preferably by one amino acid from the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6. A polypeptide of the present invention preferably comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6, or an allelic variant thereof; or a fragment thereof having glucoamylase activity. In another preferred aspect, the polypeptide comprises the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6 or an allelic variant thereof; or a fragment thereof having glucoamylase activity. In another preferred aspect, the polypeptide consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6 or an allelic variant thereof; or a fragment thereof having glucoamylase activity. In a second aspect, the present invention relates to isolated polypeptides having glucoamylase activity that are encoded by polynucleotides that hybridize under preferably very low stringency conditions, more preferably low stringency conditions, more preferably medium stringency conditions, more preferably medium-high stringency conditions, even more preferably high stringency conditions, and most preferably very high stringency conditions with (i) the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5, (ii) the cDNA sequence contained in SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5, (iii) a subsequence of (i) or (ii), or (iv) a full-length complementary strand of (i), (ii), or (iii) (J. Sambrook, E. F. Fritsch, and T. Maniatis, 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d edition, Cold Spring Harbor, New York). A subsequence of the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5 contains at least 100 contiguous nucleotides or preferably at least 200 contiguous nucleotides. Moreover, the subsequence may encode a polypeptide fragment having glucoamylase activity. Preferably, the complementary strand is the full-length complementary strand of the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, of SEQ ID NO: 3 or of SEQ ID NO: 5. The nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5; or a subsequence thereof; as well as the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6; or a fragment thereof; may be used to design nucleic acid probes to identify and clone DNA encoding polypeptides having glucoamylase activity from strains of different genera or species according to methods well known in the art. In particular, such probes can be used for hybridization with the genomic or cDNA of the genus or species of interest, following standard Southern blotting procedures, in order to identify and isolate the corresponding gene therein. Such probes can be considerably shorter than the entire sequence, but should be at least 14, preferably at least 25, more preferably at least 35, and most preferably at least 70 nucleotides in length. It is, however, preferred that the nucleic acid probe is at least 100 nucleotides in length. For example, the nucleic acid probe may be at least 200 nucleotides, preferably at least 300 nucleotides, more preferably at least 400 nucleotides, or most preferably at least 500 nucleotides in length. Even longer probes may be used, e.g., nucleic acid probes that are preferably at least 600 nucleotides, more preferably at least 700 nucleotides, even more preferably at least 800 nucleotides, or most preferably at least 900 nucleotides in length. Both DNA and RNA probes can be used. The probes are typically labeled for detecting the corresponding gene (for example, with 33P, 32P, 3H, 35S, biotin, or avidin). Such probes are encompassed by the present invention. A genomic DNA or cDNA library prepared from such other strains may, therefore, be screened for DNA that hybridizes with the probes described above and encodes a polypeptide having glucoamylase activity. Genomic or other DNA from such other strains may be separated by agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or other separation techniques. DNA from the libraries or the separated DNA may be transferred to and immobilized on nitrocellulose or other suitable carrier material. In order to identify a clone or DNA that is homologous with SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5; or a subsequence thereof; the carrier material is preferably used in a Southern blot. For purposes of the present invention, hybridization indicates that the nucleotide sequence hybridizes to a labeled nucleic acid probe corresponding to the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5; the cDNA sequence contained in SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5; its full-length complementary strand; or a subsequence thereof; under very low to very high stringency conditions. Molecules to which the nucleic acid probe hybridizes under these conditions can be detected using, for example, X-ray film. Preferably, the nucleic acid probe is the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5. In another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is a polynucleotide sequence that encodes the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, or a subsequence thereof. In another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is SEQ ID NO: 1. In another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is the polynucleotide sequence contained in plasmid in E. coli strain DSM 23221, wherein the polynucleotide sequence thereof encodes a polypeptide having glucoamylase activity. In another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is the mature polypeptide coding region contained in plasmid in E. coli strain DSM 23221. In another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3. In another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is a polynucleotide sequence that encodes the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 4, or a subsequence thereof. In another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is SEQ ID NO: 3. In another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5. In another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is a polynucleotide sequence that encodes the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 6, or a subsequence thereof. In another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is SEQ ID NO: 5. For long probes of at least 100 nucleotides in length, very low to very high stringency conditions are defined as prehybridization and hybridization at 42° C. in 5×SSPE, 0.3% SDS, 200 micrograms/ml sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA, and either 25% formamide for very low and low stringencies, 35% formamide for medium and medium-high stringencies, or 50% formamide for high and very high stringencies, following standard Southern blotting procedures for 12 to 24 hours optimally. For long probes of at least 100 nucleotides in length, the carrier material is finally washed three times each for 15 minutes using 2×SSC, 0.2% SDS preferably at 45° C. (very low stringency), more preferably at 50° C. (low stringency), more preferably at 55° C. (medium stringency), more preferably at 60° C. (medium-high stringency), even more preferably at 65° C. (high stringency), and most preferably at 70° C. (very high stringency). For short probes that are about 15 nucleotides to about 70 nucleotides in length, stringency conditions are defined as prehybridization, hybridization, and washing post-hybridization at about 5° C. to about 10° C. below the calculated Tm using the calculation according to Bolton and McCarthy (1962, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 48:1390) in 0.9 M NaCl, 0.09 M Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 6 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1×Denhardt's solution, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium monobasic phosphate, 0.1 mM ATP, and 0.2 mg of yeast RNA per ml following standard Southern blotting procedures for 12 to 24 hours optimally. For short probes that are about 15 nucleotides to about 70 nucleotides in length, the carrier material is washed once in 6×SCC plus 0.1% SDS for 15 minutes and twice each for 15 minutes using 6×SSC at 5° C. to 10° C. below the calculated Tm. In a third aspect, the present invention relates to isolated polypeptides having glucoamylase activity encoded by polynucleotides comprising or consisting of nucleotide sequences that have a degree of identity to the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5 of at least 90%, more preferably at least 91%, more preferably at least 92%, even more preferably at least 93%, most preferably at least 94%, most preferably at least 95%, and even most preferably 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%, which encode an active polypeptide. See polynucleotide section herein. The present invention also relates to artificial variants comprising a substitution, deletion, and/or insertion of one or more (or several) amino acids of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6; or a homologous sequence thereof. Preferably, amino acid changes are of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions or insertions that do not significantly affect the folding and/or activity of the protein; small deletions, typically of one to about 30 amino acids; small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an amino-terminal methionine residue; a small linker peptide of up to about 20-25 residues; or a small extension that facilitates purification by changing net charge or another function, such as a poly-histidine tract, an antigenic epitope or a binding domain. Examples of conservative substitutions are within the group of basic amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine), acidic amino acids (glutamic acid and aspartic acid), polar amino acids (glutamine and asparagine), hydrophobic amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine), and small amino acids (glycine, alanine, serine, threonine and methionine). Amino acid substitutions that do not generally alter specific activity are known in the art and are described, for example, by H. Neurath and R. L. Hill, 1979, In, The Proteins, Academic Press, New York. The most commonly occurring exchanges are Ala/Ser, Val/Ile, Asp/Glu, Thr/Ser, Ala/Gly, Ala/Thr, Ser/Asn, Ala/Val, Ser/Gly, Tyr/Phe, Ala/Pro, Lys/Arg, Asp/Asn, Leu/Ile, Leu/Val, Ala/Glu, and Asp/Gly. In addition to the 20 standard amino acids, non-standard amino acids (such as 4-hydroxyproline, 6-N-methyl lysine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, isovaline, and alpha-methyl serine) may be substituted for amino acid residues of a wild-type polypeptide. A limited number of non-conservative amino acids, amino acids that are not encoded by the genetic code, and unnatural amino acids may be substituted for amino acid residues. “Unnatural amino acids” have been modified after protein synthesis, and/or have a chemical structure in their side chain(s) different from that of the standard amino acids. Unnatural amino acids can be chemically synthesized, and preferably, are commercially available, and include pipecolic acid, thiazolidine carboxylic acid, dehydroproline, 3- and 4-methylproline, and 3,3-dimethylproline. Alternatively, the amino acid changes are of such a nature that the physico-chemical properties of the polypeptides are altered. For example, amino acid changes may improve the thermal stability of the polypeptide, alter the substrate specificity, change the pH optimum, and the like. Essential amino acids in the parent polypeptide can be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, 1989, Science 244: 1081-1085). In the latter technique, single alanine mutations are introduced at every residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for glucoamylase activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. See also, Hilton et al., 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271: 4699-4708. The active site of the enzyme or other biological interaction can also be determined by physical analysis of structure, as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography, electron diffraction, or photoaffinity labeling, in conjunction with mutation of putative contact site amino acids. See, for example, de Vos et al., 1992, Science 255: 306-312; Smith et al., 1992, J. Mol. Biol. 224: 899-904; Wlodaver et al., 1992, FEBS Lett. 309: 59-64. The identities of essential amino acids can also be inferred from analysis of identities with polypeptides that are related to a polypeptide according to the invention. Single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions can be made and tested using known methods of mutagenesis, recombination, and/or shuffling, followed by a relevant screening procedure, such as those disclosed by Reidhaar-Olson and Sauer, 1988, Science 241: 53-57; Bowie and Sauer, 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 2152-2156; WO 95/17413; or WO 95/22625. Other methods that can be used include error-prone PCR, phage display (e.g., Lowman et al., 1991, Biochem. 30: 10832-10837; U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; WO 92/06204), and region-directed mutagenesis (Derbyshire et al., 1986, Gene 46: 145; Ner et al., 1988, DNA 7: 127). Mutagenesis/shuffling methods can be combined with high-throughput, automated screening methods to detect activity of cloned, mutagenized polypeptides expressed by host cells (Ness et al., 1999, Nature Biotechnology 17: 893-896). Mutagenized DNA molecules that encode active polypeptides can be recovered from the host cells and rapidly sequenced using standard methods in the art. These methods allow the rapid determination of the importance of individual amino acid residues in a polypeptide of interest, and can be applied to polypeptides of unknown structure. The total number of amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions of the mature polypeptide, such as amino acids 19 to 573 of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6, or the catalytic domain, such as amino acids 22 to 476 of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6, is 10, preferably 9, more preferably 8, more preferably 7, more preferably at most 6, more preferably 5, more preferably 4, even more preferably 3, most preferably 2, and even most preferably 1. Sources of Polypeptides Having Glucoamylase Activity A polypeptide of the present invention may be obtained from microorganisms of any genus. For purposes of the present invention, the term “obtained from” as used herein in connection with a given source shall mean that the polypeptide encoded by a nucleotide sequence is produced by the source or by a strain in which the nucleotide sequence from the source has been inserted. Preferably, the polypeptide obtained from a given source is secreted extracellularly. A polypeptide having glucoamylase activity of the present invention may also be bacterial polypeptide, or a yeast polypeptide, or more preferably a filamentous fungal polypeptide such as an Acremonium, Agaricus, Alternaria, Artomyces, Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, Botryospaeria, Ceriporiopsis, Chaetomidium, Chrysosporium, Claviceps, Cochliobolus, Coprinopsis, Coptotermes, Corynascus, Cryphonectria, Cryptococcus, Diplodia, Exidia, Filibasidium, Fusarium, Gibberella, Gloeophyllum, Holomastigotoides, Humicola, Irpex, Lentinula, Leptospaeria, Magnaporthe, Melanocarpus, Meripilus, Mucor, Myceliophthora, Neocallimastix, Neurospora, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Phanerochaete, Piromyces, Poitrasia, Pseudoplectania, Pseudotrichonympha, Pycnoporus, Rhizomucor, Schizophyllum, Scytalidium, Talaromyces, Thermoascus, Thielavia, Tolypocladium, Trichoderma, Trichophaea, Verticillium, Volvariella, or Xylaria polypeptide having glucoamylase activity. In a more preferred aspect, the polypeptide is a Pycnoporus sp. polypeptide having glucoamylase activity. Particularly the Pycnoporus sp. is Pycnoporus sanguineus. It will be understood that for the aforementioned species the invention encompasses both the perfect and imperfect states, and other taxonomic equivalents, e.g., anamorphs, regardless of the species name by which they are known. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize the identity of appropriate equivalents. Strains of these species are readily accessible to the public in a number of culture collections, such as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen GmbH (DSM), Centraalbureau Voor Schimmelcultures (CBS), and Agricultural Research Service Patent Culture Collection, Northern Regional Research Center (NRRL). Furthermore, such polypeptides may be identified and obtained from other sources including microorganisms isolated from nature (e.g., soil, composts, water, etc.) using the above-mentioned probes. Techniques for isolating microorganisms from natural habitats are well known in the art. The polynucleotide may then be obtained by similarly screening a genomic or cDNA library of such a microorganism. Once a polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide has been detected with the probe(s), the polynucleotide can be isolated or cloned by utilizing techniques that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, supra). Polypeptides of the present invention also include fused polypeptides or cleavable fusion polypeptides in which another polypeptide is fused at the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the polypeptide or fragment thereof. A fused polypeptide is produced by fusing a nucleotide sequence (or a portion thereof) encoding another polypeptide to a nucleotide sequence (or a portion thereof) of the present invention. Techniques for producing fusion polypeptides are known in the art, and include ligating the coding sequences encoding the polypeptides so that they are in frame and that expression of the fused polypeptide is under control of the same promoter(s) and terminator. A fusion polypeptide can further comprise a cleavage site. Upon secretion of the fusion protein, the site is cleaved releasing the polypeptide having glucoamylase activity from the fusion protein. Examples of cleavage sites include, but are not limited to, a Kex2 site that encodes the dipeptide Lys-Arg (Martin et al., 2003, J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 3: 568-76; Svetina et al., 2000, J. Biotechnol. 76: 245-251; Rasmussen-Wilson et al., 1997, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63: 3488-3493; Ward et al., 1995, Biotechnology 13: 498-503; and Contreras et al., 1991, Biotechnology 9: 378-381), an Ile-(Glu or Asp)-Gly-Arg site, which is cleaved by a Factor Xa protease after the arginine residue (Eaton et al., 1986, Biochem. 25: 505-512); an Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys site, which is cleaved by an enterokinase after the lysine (Collins-Racie et al., 1995, Biotechnology 13: 982-987); a His-Tyr-Glu site or His-Tyr-Asp site, which is cleaved by Genenase I (Carter et al., 1989, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics 6: 240-248); a Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser site, which is cleaved by thrombin after the Arg (Stevens, 2003, Drug Discovery World 4: 35-48); a Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Gly site, which is cleaved by TEV protease after the Gln (Stevens, 2003, supra); and a Leu-Glu-Val-Leu-Phe-Gln-Gly-Pro site, which is cleaved by a genetically engineered form of human rhinovirus 3C protease after the Gln (Stevens, 2003, supra). Polynucleotides The present invention also relates to isolated polynucleotides comprising or consisting of nucleotide sequences that encode polypeptides having glucoamylase activity of the present invention. Preferably, the nucleotide sequence comprises or consists of SEQ ID NO: 1. In another more preferred aspect, the nucleotide sequence comprises or consists of the sequence contained in plasmid which is contained in E. coli DSM 23221. In another preferred aspect, the nucleotide sequence comprises or consists of the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. In another more preferred aspect, the nucleotide sequence comprises or consists of the mature polypeptide coding sequence contained in plasmid contained in E. coli DSM 23221. The present invention also encompasses nucleotide sequences that encode polypeptides comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or the mature polypeptide thereof, which differ from SEQ ID NO: 1 or the mature polypeptide coding sequence thereof by virtue of the degeneracy of the genetic code. The present invention also relates to subsequences of SEQ ID NO: 1 that encode fragments of SEQ ID NO: 2 that have glucoamylase activity. The present invention also relates to mutant polynucleotides comprising or consisting of at least one mutation in the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, in which the mutant nucleotide sequence encodes the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2. Preferably, the nucleotide sequence comprises or consists of SEQ ID NO: 3. In another preferred aspect, the nucleotide sequence comprises or consists of the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3. The present invention also encompasses nucleotide sequences that encode polypeptides comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4 or the mature polypeptide thereof, which differ from SEQ ID NO: 3 or the mature polypeptide coding sequence thereof by virtue of the degeneracy of the genetic code. The present invention also relates to subsequences of SEQ ID NO: 3 that encode fragments of SEQ ID NO: 4 that have glucoamylase activity. The present invention also relates to mutant polynucleotides comprising or consisting of at least one mutation in the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, in which the mutant nucleotide sequence encodes the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 4. Preferably, the nucleotide sequence comprises or consists of SEQ ID NO: 5. In another preferred aspect, the nucleotide sequence comprises or consists of the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5. The present invention also encompasses nucleotide sequences that encode polypeptides comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or the mature polypeptide thereof, which differ from SEQ ID NO: 5 or the mature polypeptide coding sequence thereof by virtue of the degeneracy of the genetic code. The present invention also relates to subsequences of SEQ ID NO: 5 that encode fragments of SEQ ID NO: 6 that have glucoamylase activity. The present invention also relates to mutant polynucleotides comprising or consisting of at least one mutation in the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, in which the mutant nucleotide sequence encodes the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 6. The techniques used to isolate or clone a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide are known in the art and include isolation from genomic DNA, preparation from cDNA, or a combination thereof. The cloning of the polynucleotides of the present invention from such genomic DNA can be effected, e.g., by using the well known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody screening of expression libraries to detect cloned DNA fragments with shared structural features. See, e.g., Innis et al., 1990, PCR: A Guide to Methods and Application, Academic Press, New York. Other nucleic acid amplification procedures such as ligase chain reaction (LCR), ligated activated transcription (LAT) and nucleotide sequence-based amplification (NASBA) may be used. The polynucleotides may be cloned from a strain of Penicillium, or another or related organism and thus, for example, may be an allelic or species variant of the polypeptide encoding region of the nucleotide sequence. The present invention also relates to isolated polynucleotides comprising or consisting of nucleotide sequences that have a degree of identity to the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, of SEQ ID NO: 3 or of SEQ ID NO: 5 of preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 91%, more preferably at least 92%, even more preferably at least 93%, most preferably at least 94%, and even most preferably at least 95%, such as at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% identity, which encode an active polypeptide. Modification of a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the present invention may be necessary for the synthesis of polypeptides substantially similar to the polypeptide. The term “substantially similar” to the polypeptide refers to non-naturally occurring forms of the polypeptide. These polypeptides may differ in some engineered way from the polypeptide isolated from its native source, e.g., artificial variants that differ in specific activity, thermostability, pH optimum, or the like. The variant sequence may be constructed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence presented as the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, e.g., a subsequence thereof, and/or by introduction of nucleotide substitutions that do not give rise to another amino acid sequence of the polypeptide encoded by the nucleotide sequence, but which correspond to the codon usage of the host organism intended for production of the enzyme, or by introduction of nucleotide substitutions that may give rise to a different amino acid sequence. For a general description of nucleotide substitution, see, e.g., Ford et al., 1991, Protein Expression and Purification 2: 95-107. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that such substitutions can be made outside the regions critical to the function of the molecule and still result in an active polypeptide. Amino acid residues essential to the activity of the polypeptide encoded by an isolated polynucleotide of the invention, and therefore preferably not subject to substitution, may be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (see, e.g., Cunningham and Wells, 1989, supra). In the latter technique, mutations are introduced at every positively charged residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for glucoamylase activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. Sites of substrate-enzyme interaction can also be determined by analysis of the three-dimensional structure as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, crystallography or photoaffinity labeling (see, e.g., de Vos et al., 1992, supra; Smith et al., 1992, supra; Wlodaver et al., 1992, supra). The present invention also relates to isolated polynucleotides encoding polypeptides of the present invention, which hybridize under very low stringency conditions, preferably low stringency conditions, more preferably medium stringency conditions, more preferably medium-high stringency conditions, even more preferably high stringency conditions, and most preferably very high stringency conditions with (i) the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5, (ii) the cDNA sequence contained in SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5, or (iii) a full-length complementary strand of (i) or (ii); or allelic variants and subsequences thereof (Sambrook et al., 1989, supra), as defined herein. Preferably, the complementary strand is the full-length complementary strand of the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5. The present invention also relates to isolated polynucleotides obtained by (a) hybridizing a population of DNA under very low, low, medium, medium-high, high, or very high stringency conditions with (i) the mature polypeptide coding sequence SEQ ID NO: 1, of SEQ ID NO: 3 or of SEQ ID NO: 5, (ii) the cDNA sequence contained in SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5, or (iii) a full-length complementary strand of (i) or (ii); and (b) isolating the hybridizing polynucleotide, which encodes a polypeptide having glucoamylase activity. Preferably, the complementary strand is the full-length complementary strand of the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5. Hybrid Enzymes The present invention also relates to hybrid enzymes comprising a catalytic domain having enzyme activity (e.g., starch degrading enzyme activity, such as alpha-amylase, amylopullulanase, beta-amylase, CGTase, glucoamylase, isoamylase, maltogenic amylase, or pullulanase activity), and a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). The hybrid enzyme may further comprise a linker. The hybrid may be produced by fusing a first DNA sequence encoding a catalytic domain and a second DNA sequence encoding a carbohydrate-binding module, or the hybrid may be produced as a completely synthetic gene based on knowledge of the amino acid sequences of suitable CBMs, linkers and catalytic domains. The term “hybrid enzyme” (also referred to as “fusion protein”, “hybrid”, “hybrid polypeptide” or “hybrid protein”) is used herein to characterize the hybrid polypeptides of the invention comprising a catalytic module having enzyme activity (e.g., starch degrading enzyme activity, such as alpha-amylase, amylopullulanase, beta-amylase, CGTase, glucoamylase, isoamylase, maltogenic amylase, or pullulanase activity) and a carbohydrate-binding module wherein the catalytic domain and the carbohydrate-binding module are derived from different sources. The term “source” includes, but is not limited to, a parent enzyme or a variant thereof, e.g., an amylase or glucoamylase, or other catalytic activity comprising a suitable catalytic module and/or a suitable CBM and/or a suitable linker. However the CBM may also be derived from a polypeptide having no catalytic activity. The catalytic domain and the carbohydrate binding module may be derived from the same microbial strain, from strains within the same species, from closely related species or less related organisms. Preferably the catalytic domain and the carbohydrate binding module of the hybrids are derived from different sources, e.g., from different enzymes from the same strain and/or species, or, e.g., from strains within different species. In one aspect the hybrid enzyme comprises the CBM (also known as a carbohydrate binding domain or CBD) according to the invention and a catalytic domain. The catalytic domain is in a particular embodiment a glucoamylase catalytic domain. Nucleic Acid Constructs The present invention also relates to nucleic acid constructs comprising an isolated polynucleotide of the present invention operably linked to one or more (several) control sequences that direct the expression of the coding sequence in a suitable host cell under conditions compatible with the control sequences. An isolated polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention may be manipulated in a variety of ways to provide for expression of the polypeptide. Manipulation of the polynucleotide's sequence prior to its insertion into a vector may be desirable or necessary depending on the expression vector. The techniques for modifying polynucleotide sequences utilizing recombinant DNA methods are well known in the art. The control sequence may be an appropriate promoter sequence, a nucleotide sequence that is recognized by a host cell for expression of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention. The promoter sequence contains transcriptional control sequences that mediate the expression of the polypeptide. The promoter may be any nucleotide sequence that shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice including mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters, and may be obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular polypeptides either homologous or heterologous to the host cell. Examples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present invention in a filamentous fungal host cell are promoters obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase, Aspergillus niger acid stable alpha-amylase, Aspergillus niger or Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase (glaA), Rhizomucor miehei lipase, Aspergillus oryzae alkaline protease, Aspergillus oryzae triose phosphate isomerase, Aspergillus nidulans acetamidase, Fusarium venenatum amyloglucosidase (WO 00/56900), Fusarium venenatum Daria (WO 00/56900), Fusarium venenatum Quinn (WO 00/56900), Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease (WO 96/00787), Trichoderma reesei beta-glucosidase, Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I, Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase II, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase I, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase II, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase III, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase IV, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase V, Trichoderma reesei xylanase I, Trichoderma reesei xylanase II, Trichoderma reesei beta-xylosidase, as well as the NA2-tpi promoter (a hybrid of the promoters from the genes for Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase and Aspergillus oryzae triose phosphate isomerase); and mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters thereof. In a yeast host, useful promoters are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase (ENO-1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae galactokinase (GAL1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH1, ADH2/GAP), Saccharomyces cerevisiae triose phosphate isomerase (TPI), Saccharomyces cerevisiae metallothionein (CUP1), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. Other useful promoters for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al., 1992, Yeast 8: 423-488. The control sequence may also be a suitable transcription terminator sequence, a sequence recognized by a host cell to terminate transcription. The terminator sequence is operably linked to the 3′ terminus of the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide. Any terminator that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used in the present invention. Preferred terminators for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus nidulans anthranilate synthase, Aspergillus niger alpha-glucosidase, and Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease. Preferred terminators for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome C (CYC1), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Other useful terminators for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al., 1992, supra. The control sequence may also be a suitable leader sequence, a nontranslated region of an mRNA that is important for translation by the host cell. The leader sequence is operably linked to the 5′ terminus of the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide. Any leader sequence that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used in the present invention. Preferred leaders for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase and Aspergillus nidulans triose phosphate isomerase. Suitable leaders for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase (ENO-1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH2/GAP). The control sequence may also be a polyadenylation sequence, a sequence operably linked to the 3′ terminus of the nucleotide sequence and, when transcribed, is recognized by the host cell as a signal to add polyadenosine residues to transcribed mRNA. Any polyadenylation sequence that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used in the present invention. Preferred polyadenylation sequences for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus nidulans anthranilate synthase, Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease, and Aspergillus niger alpha-glucosidase. Useful polyadenylation sequences for yeast host cells are described by Guo and Sherman, 1995, Molecular Cellular Biology 15: 5983-5990. The control sequence may also be a signal peptide coding sequence that codes for an amino acid sequence linked to the amino terminus of a polypeptide and directs the encoded polypeptide into the cell's secretory pathway. The 5′ end of the coding sequence of the nucleotide sequence may inherently contain a signal peptide coding sequence naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding sequence that encodes the secreted polypeptide. Alternatively, the 5′ end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding sequence that is foreign to the coding sequence. The foreign signal peptide coding sequence may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a signal peptide coding sequence. Alternatively, the foreign signal peptide coding sequence may simply replace the natural signal peptide coding sequence in order to enhance secretion of the polypeptide. However, any signal peptide coding sequence that directs the expressed polypeptide into the secretory pathway of a host cell of choice, i.e., secreted into a culture medium, may be used in the present invention. Effective signal peptide coding sequences for filamentous fungal host cells are the signal peptide coding sequences obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Aspergillus niger neutral amylase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, Humicola insolens cellulase, Humicola insolens endoglucanase V, and Humicola lanuginosa lipase. It may also be desirable to add regulatory sequences that allow the regulation of the expression of the polypeptide relative to the growth of the host cell. Examples of regulatory systems are those that cause the expression of the gene to be turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus, including the presence of a regulatory compound. Regulatory systems in prokaryotic systems include the lac, tac, xyl and trp operator systems. In yeast, the ADH2 system or GAL1 system may be used. In filamentous fungi, the TAKA alpha-amylase promoter, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase promoter, and Aspergillus oryzae glucoamylase promoter may be used as regulatory sequences. Other examples of regulatory sequences are those that allow for gene amplification. In eukaryotic systems, these regulatory sequences include the dihydrofolate reductase gene that is amplified in the presence of methotrexate, and the metallothionein genes that are amplified with heavy metals. In these cases, the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide would be operably linked with the regulatory sequence. Expression Vectors The present invention also relates to recombinant expression vectors comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention, a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The various nucleic acids and control sequences described herein may be joined together to produce a recombinant expression vector that may include one or more (several) convenient restriction sites to allow for insertion or substitution of the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide at such sites. Alternatively, a polynucleotide sequence of the present invention may be expressed by inserting the nucleotide sequence or a nucleic acid construct comprising the sequence into an appropriate vector for expression. In creating the expression vector, the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression. The recombinant expression vector may be any vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus) that can be conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures and can bring about expression of the nucleotide sequence. The choice of the vector will typically depend on the compatibility of the vector with the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced. The vectors may be linear or closed circular plasmids. The vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e., a vector that exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g., a plasmid, an extrachromosomal element, a minichromosome, or an artificial chromosome. The vector may contain any means for assuring self-replication. Alternatively, the vector may be one that, when introduced into the host cell, is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. Furthermore, a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids that together contain the total DNA to be introduced into the genome of the host cell, or a transposon, may be used. The vectors of the present invention preferably contain one or more (several) selectable markers that permit easy selection of transformed, transfected, transduced, or the like cells. A selectable marker is a gene the product of which provides for biocide or viral resistance, resistance to heavy metals, prototrophy to auxotrophs, and the like. Selectable markers for use in a filamentous fungal host cell include, but are not limited to, amdS (acetamidase), argB (ornithine carbamoyltransferase), bar (phosphinothricin acetyltransferase), hph (hygromycin phosphotransferase), niaD (nitrate reductase), pyrG (orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase), sC (sulfate adenyltransferase), and trpC (anthranilate synthase), as well as equivalents thereof. Preferred for use in an Aspergillus cell are the amdS and pyrG genes of Aspergillus nidulans or Aspergillus oryzae and the bar gene of Streptomyces hygroscopicus. The vectors of the present invention preferably contain an element(s) that permits integration of the vector into the host cell's genome or autonomous replication of the vector in the cell independent of the genome. For integration into the host cell genome, the vector may rely on the polynucleotide's sequence encoding the polypeptide or any other element of the vector for integration into the genome by homologous or nonhomologous recombination. Alternatively, the vector may contain additional nucleotide sequences for directing integration by homologous recombination into the genome of the host cell at a precise location(s) in the chromosome(s). To increase the likelihood of integration at a precise location, the integrational elements should preferably contain a sufficient number of nucleic acids, such as 100 to 10,000 base pairs, preferably 400 to 10,000 base pairs, and most preferably 800 to 10,000 base pairs, which have a high degree of identity to the corresponding target sequence to enhance the probability of homologous recombination. The integrational elements may be any sequence that is homologous with the target sequence in the genome of the host cell. Furthermore, the integrational elements may be non-encoding or encoding nucleotide sequences. On the other hand, the vector may be integrated into the genome of the host cell by non-homologous recombination. For autonomous replication, the vector may further comprise an origin of replication enabling the vector to replicate autonomously in the host cell in question. The origin of replication may be any plasmid replicator mediating autonomous replication that functions in a cell. The term “origin of replication” or “plasmid replicator” is defined herein as a nucleotide sequence that enables a plasmid or vector to replicate in vivo. Examples of origins of replication useful in a filamentous fungal cell are AMA1 and ANS1 (Gems et al., 1991, Gene 98: 61-67; Cullen et al., 1987, Nucleic Acids Research 15: 9163-9175; WO 00/24883). Isolation of the AMA1 gene and construction of plasmids or vectors comprising the gene can be accomplished according to the methods disclosed in WO 00/24883. More than one copy of a polynucleotide of the present invention may be inserted into a host cell to increase production of the gene product. An increase in the copy number of the polynucleotide can be obtained by integrating at least one additional copy of the sequence into the host cell genome or by including an amplifiable selectable marker gene with the polynucleotide where cells containing amplified copies of the selectable marker gene, and thereby additional copies of the polynucleotide, can be selected for by cultivating the cells in the presence of the appropriate selectable agent. The procedures used to ligate the elements described above to construct the recombinant expression vectors of the present invention are well known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, supra). Host Cells The present invention also relates to recombinant host cells, comprising an isolated polynucleotide of the present invention, which are advantageously used in the recombinant production of the polypeptides. A vector comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention is introduced into a host cell so that the vector is maintained as a chromosomal integrant or as a self-replicating extra-chromosomal vector as described earlier. The term “host cell” encompasses any progeny of a parent cell that is not identical to the parent cell due to mutations that occur during replication. The choice of a host cell will to a large extent depend upon the gene encoding the polypeptide and its source. The host cell may be any cell useful in the recombinant production of a polypeptide of the present invention, e.g., a prokaryote or a eukaryote. The prokaryotic host cell may be any gram-positive bacterium or gram-negative bacterium. Gram-positive bacteria include, but are not limited to, Bacillus, Enterococcus, Clostridium, Geobacillus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Oceanobacillus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Streptomyces.

The filamentous fungi are generally characterized by a mycelial wall composed of chitin, cellulose, glucan, chitosan, mannan, and other complex polysaccharides. Vegetative growth is by hyphal elongation and carbon catabolism is obligately aerobic.

Fungal cells may be transformed by a process involving protoplast formation, transformation of the protoplasts, and regeneration of the cell wall in a manner known per se. Suitable procedures for transformation of Aspergillus and Trichoderma host cells are described in EP 0238023 and Yelton et al., 1984, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 81: 1470-1474. Suitable methods for transforming Fusarium species are described by Malardier et al., 1989, Gene 78: 147-156, and WO 96/00787. Yeast may be transformed using the procedures described by Becker and Guarente, In Abelson, J. N. and Simon, M.

Methods of Production The present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention, comprising: (a) cultivating a cell, which in its wild-type form produces the polypeptide, under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide; and (b) recovering the polypeptide. Preferably, the cell is of the genus Pycnoporus. In a more preferred aspect, the cell is of the species Pycnoporus sanguineus. The present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention, comprising: (a) cultivating a recombinant host cell, as described herein, under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide; and (b) recovering the polypeptide. The present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention, comprising: (a) cultivating a recombinant host cell under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide, wherein the host cell comprises a mutant nucleotide sequence having at least one mutation in the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, of SEQ ID NO: 3, or of SEQ ID NO: 5, wherein the mutant nucleotide sequence encodes a polypeptide that comprises or consists of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, of SEQ ID NO: 4 or of SEQ ID NO: 6 and (b) recovering the polypeptide. In the production methods of the present invention, the cells are cultivated in a nutrient medium suitable for production of the polypeptide using methods well known in the art. For example, the cell may be cultivated by shake flask cultivation, and small-scale or large-scale fermentation (including continuous, batch, fed-batch, or solid state fermentations) in laboratory or industrial fermentors performed in a suitable medium and under conditions allowing the polypeptide to be expressed and/or isolated. The cultivation takes place in a suitable nutrient medium comprising carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic salts, using procedures known in the art. Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to published compositions (e.g., in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection). If the polypeptide is secreted into the nutrient medium, the polypeptide can be recovered directly from the medium. If the polypeptide is not secreted into the medium, it can be recovered from cell lysates. The polypeptides may be detected using methods known in the art that are specific for the polypeptides. These detection methods may include use of specific antibodies, formation of an enzyme product, or disappearance of an enzyme substrate. For example, an enzyme assay may be used to determine the activity of the polypeptide as described herein. The resulting polypeptide may be recovered using methods known in the art. For example, the polypeptide may be recovered from the nutrient medium by conventional procedures including, but not limited to, centrifugation, filtration, extraction, spray-drying, evaporation, or precipitation. The polypeptides of the present invention may be purified by a variety of procedures known in the art including, but not limited to, chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, hydrophobic, chromatofocusing, and size exclusion), electrophoretic procedures (e.g., preparative isoelectric focusing), differential solubility (e.g., ammonium sulfate precipitation), SDS-PAGE, or extraction (see, e.g., Protein Purification, J.-C. Janson and Lars Ryden, editors, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989) to obtain substantially pure polypeptides. Plants The present invention also relates to plants, e.g., a transgenic plant, plant part, or plant cell, comprising an isolated polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide having glucoamylase activity of the present invention so as to express and produce the polypeptide in recoverable quantities. The polypeptide may be recovered from the plant or plant part. Alternatively, the plant or plant part containing the recombinant polypeptide may be used as such for improving the quality of a food or feed, e.g., improving nutritional value, palatability, and rheological properties, or to destroy an antinutritive factor. The transgenic plant can be dicotyledonous (a dicot) or monocotyledonous (a monocot). Examples of monocot plants are grasses, such as meadow grass (blue grass, Poa), forage grass such as Festuca, Lolium, temperate grass, such as Agrostis, and cereals, e.g., wheat, oats, rye, barley, rice, sorghum, and maize (corn). Examples of dicot plants are tobacco, legumes, such as lupins, potato, sugar beet, pea, bean and soybean, and cruciferous plants (family Brassicaceae), such as cauliflower, rape seed, and the closely related model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Examples of plant parts are stem, callus, leaves, root, fruits, seeds, and tubers as well as the individual tissues comprising these parts, e.g., epidermis, mesophyll, parenchyme, vascular tissues, meristems. Specific plant cell compartments, such as chloroplasts, apoplasts, mitochondria, vacuoles, peroxisomes and cytoplasm are also considered to be a plant part. Furthermore, any plant cell, whatever the tissue origin, is considered to be a plant part. Likewise, plant parts such as specific tissues and cells isolated to facilitate the utilisation of the invention are also considered plant parts, e.g., embryos, endosperms, aleurone and seeds coats. Also included within the scope of the present invention are the progeny of such plants, plant parts, and plant cells. The transgenic plant or plant cell expressing a polypeptide of the present invention may be constructed in accordance with methods known in the art. In short, the plant or plant cell is constructed by incorporating one or more (several) expression constructs encoding a polypeptide of the present invention into the plant host genome or chloroplast genome and propagating the resulting modified plant or plant cell into a transgenic plant or plant cell. The expression construct is conveniently a nucleic acid construct that comprises a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention operably linked with appropriate regulatory sequences required for expression of the nucleotide sequence in the plant or plant part of choice. Furthermore, the expression construct may comprise a selectable marker useful for identifying host cells into which the expression construct has been integrated and DNA sequences necessary for introduction of the construct into the plant in question (the latter depends on the DNA introduction method to be used). The choice of regulatory sequences, such as promoter and terminator sequences and optionally signal or transit sequences is determined, for example, on the basis of when, where, and how the polypeptide is desired to be expressed. For instance, the expression of the gene encoding a polypeptide of the present invention may be constitutive or inducible, or may be developmental, stage or tissue specific, and the gene product may be targeted to a specific tissue or plant part such as seeds or leaves. Regulatory sequences are, for example, described by Tague et al., 1988, Plant Physiology 86: 506. For constitutive expression, the 35S-CaMV, the maize ubiquitin 1, and the rice actin 1 promoter may be used (Franck et al., 1980, Cell 21: 285-294, Christensen et al., 1992, Plant Mol. Biol. 18: 675-689; Zhang et al., 1991, Plant Cell 3: 1155-1165). organ-specific promoters may be, for example, a promoter from storage sink tissues such as seeds, potato tubers, and fruits (Edwards & Coruzzi, 1990, Ann. Rev. Genet. 24: 275-303), or from metabolic sink tissues such as meristems (Ito et al., 1994, Plant Mol. Biol. 24: 863-878), a seed specific promoter such as the glutelin, prolamin, globulin, or albumin promoter from rice (Wu et al., 1998, Plant and Cell Physiology 39: 885-889), a Vicia faba promoter from the legumin B4 and the unknown seed protein gene from Vicia faba (Conrad et al., 1998, Journal of Plant Physiology 152: 708-711), a promoter from a seed oil body protein (Chen et al., 1998, Plant and Cell Physiology 39: 935-941), the storage protein napA promoter from Brassica napus, or any other seed specific promoter known in the art, e.g., as described in WO 91/14772. Furthermore, the promoter may be a leaf specific promoter such as the rbcs promoter from rice or tomato (Kyozuka et al., 1993, Plant Physiology 102: 991-1000, the chlorella virus adenine methyltransferase gene promoter (Mitra and Higgins, 1994, Plant Molecular Biology 26: 85-93), or the aldP gene promoter from rice (Kagaya et al., 1995, Molecular and General Genetics 248: 668-674), or a wound inducible promoter such as the potato pin2 promoter (Xu et al., 1993, Plant Molecular Biology 22: 573-588). Likewise, the promoter may inducible by abiotic treatments such as temperature, drought, or alterations in salinity or induced by exogenously applied substances that activate the promoter, e.g., ethanol, oestrogens, plant hormones such as ethylene, abscisic acid, and gibberellic acid, and heavy metals. A promoter enhancer element may also be used to achieve higher expression of a polypeptide of the present invention in the plant. For instance, the promoter enhancer element may be an intron that is placed between the promoter and the nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the present invention. For instance, Xu et al., 1993, supra, disclose the use of the first intron of the rice actin 1 gene to enhance expression. The selectable marker gene and any other parts of the expression construct may be chosen from those available in the art. The nucleic acid construct is incorporated into the plant genome according to conventional techniques known in the art, including Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, virus-mediated transformation, microinjection, particle bombardment, biolistic transformation, and electroporation (Gasser et al., 1990, Science 244: 1293; Potrykus, 1990, Bio/Technology 8: 535; Shimamoto et al., 1989, Nature 338: 274). Presently, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer is the method of choice for generating transgenic dicots (for a review, see Hooykas and Schilperoort, 1992, Plant Molecular Biology 19: 15-38) and can also be used for transforming monocots, although other transformation methods are often used for these plants. Presently, the method of choice for generating transgenic monocots is particle bombardment (microscopic gold or tungsten particles coated with the transforming DNA) of embryonic calli or developing embryos (Christou, 1992, Plant Journal 2: 275-281; Shimamoto, 1994, Current Opinion Biotechnology 5: 158-162; Vasil et al., 1992, Bio/Technology 10: 667-674). An alternative method for transformation of monocots is based on protoplast transformation as described by Omirulleh et al., 1993, Plant Molecular Biology 21: 415-428. Following transformation, the transformants having incorporated the expression construct are selected and regenerated into whole plants according to methods well-known in the art. Often the transformation procedure is designed for the selective elimination of selection genes either during regeneration or in the following generations by using, for example, co-transformation with two separate T-DNA constructs or site specific excision of the selection gene by a specific recombinase. The present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention comprising: (a) cultivating a transgenic plant or a plant cell comprising a polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide having glucoamylase activity of the present invention under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide; and (b) recovering the polypeptide. Compositions The present invention also relates to compositions comprising a polypeptide of the present invention. Preferably, the compositions are enriched in such a polypeptide. The term “enriched” indicates that the glucoamylase activity of the composition has been increased, e.g., with an enrichment factor of at least 1.1. The composition may comprise a polypeptide of the present invention as the major enzymatic component, e.g., a mono-component composition. Alternatively, the composition may comprise multiple enzymatic activities, such as an aminopeptidase, amylase, carbohydrase, carboxypeptidase, catalase, cellulase, chitinase, cutinase, cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase, deoxyribonuclease, esterase, alpha-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase, glucoamylase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, haloperoxidase, invertase, laccase, lipase, mannosidase, oxidase, pectinolytic enzyme, peptidoglutaminase, peroxidase, phytase, polyphenoloxidase, proteolytic enzyme, ribonuclease, transglutaminase, or xylanase. The additional enzyme(s) may be produced, for example, by a microorganism belonging to the genus Aspergillus, preferably Aspergillus aculeatus, Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus foetidus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus japonicus, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus niger, or Aspergillus oryzae; Fusarium, preferably Fusarium bactridioides, Fusarium cerealis, Fusarium crookwellense, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium graminum, Fusarium heterosporum, Fusarium negundi, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium reticulatum, Fusarium roseum, Fusarium sambucinum, Fusarium sarcochroum, Fusarium sulphureum, Fusarium toruloseum, Fusarium trichothecioides, or Fusarium venenatum; Humicola, preferably Humicola insolens or Humicola lanuginosa; or Trichoderma, preferably Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma koningii, Trichoderma longibrachiatum, Trichoderma reesei, or Trichoderma viride.

For instance, the polypeptide composition may be in the form of a granulate or a microgranulate. The polypeptide to be included in the composition may be stabilized in accordance with methods known in the art. Examples are given below of preferred uses of the polypeptide compositions of the invention. The dosage of the polypeptide composition of the invention and other conditions under which the composition is used may be determined on the basis of methods known in the art.

Uses according to the invention include starch conversion of starch to, e.g., syrup and fermentation products, including ethanol and beverages. Examples of processes where a glucoamylase of the invention may be used include the ones described in WO 92/20777, WO 03/066816, WO 03/066826, WO 2004/080923, and WO 2004/081193, which are hereby all incorporated by reference. Production of Fermentation Products Process for Producing Fermentation Products from Gelatinized Starch Containing Material In this aspect the present invention relates to a process for producing a fermentation product, especially ethanol, from starch-containing material, which process includes a liquefaction step and sequentially or simultaneously performed saccharification and fermentation steps. The invention relates to a process for producing a fermentation product from starch-containing material comprising the steps of: (a) liquefying starch-containing material; preferably using an alpha amylase (b) saccharifying the liquefied material obtained in step (a) using a glucoamylase of the invention; and (c) fermenting the saccharified material using a fermenting organism. The fermentation product, such as especially ethanol, may optionally be recovered after fermentation, e.g., by distillation. Suitable starch-containing starting materials are listed in the section “Starch-containing materials”-section below. Contemplated enzymes are listed in the “Enzymes”-section below. The liquefaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an alpha-amylase. The fermentation is preferably carried out in the presence of yeast, preferably a strain of Saccharomyces. Suitable fermenting organisms are listed in the “Fermenting Organisms”-section below. In preferred embodiments steps (b) and (c) are carried out sequentially or simultaneously (i.e., as SSF process). In a particular embodiment, the process of the invention further comprises, prior to step (a), the steps of: x) reducing the particle size of the starch-containing material, preferably by milling; y) forming a slurry comprising the starch-containing material and water. The aqueous slurry may contain from 10-40 wt %, preferably 25-35 wt % starch-containing material. The slurry is heated to above the gelatinization temperature and alpha-amylase, preferably bacterial and/or acid fungal alpha-amylase, may be added to initiate liquefaction (thinning). The slurry may in an embodiment be jet-cooked to further gelatinize the slurry before being subjected to an alpha-amylase in step (a) of the invention. More specifically liquefaction may be carried out as a three-step hot slurry process. The slurry is heated to between 60-95° C., preferably 80-85° C., and alpha-amylase is added to initiate liquefaction (thinning). Then the slurry may be jet-cooked at a temperature between 95-140° C., preferably 105-125° C., for 1-15 minutes, preferably for 3-10 minute, especially around 5 minutes. The slurry is cooled to 60-95° C. and more alpha-amylase is added to finalize hydrolysis (secondary liquefaction). The liquefaction process is usually carried out at pH 4.5-6.5, in particular at a pH between 5 and 6. Milled and liquefied whole grains are known as mash. The saccharification in step (b) may be carried out using conditions well know in the art. For instance, a full saccharification process may last up to from about 24 to about 72 hours, however, it is common only to do a pre-saccharification of typically 40-90 minutes at a temperature between 30-65° C., typically about 60° C., followed by complete saccharification during fermentation in a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process (SSF process). Saccharification is typically carried out at temperatures from 30-65° C., typically around 60° C., and at a pH between 4 and 5, normally at about pH 4.5. The most widely used process in fermentation product, especially ethanol, production is the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process, in which there is no holding stage for the saccharification, meaning that fermenting organism, such as yeast, and enzyme(s) may be added together. SSF may typically be carried out at a temperature between 25° C. and 40° C., such as between 29° C. and 35° C., such as between 30° C. and 34° C., such as around 32° C. According to the invention the temperature may be adjusted up or down during fermentation. In accordance with the present invention the fermentation step (c) includes, without limitation, fermentation processes used to produce alcohols (e.g., ethanol, methanol, butanol); organic acids (e.g., citric acid, acetic acid, itaconic acid, lactic acid, gluconic acid); ketones (e.g., acetone); amino acids (e.g., glutamic acid); gases (e.g., H2 and CO2); antibiotics (e.g., penicillin and tetracycline); enzymes; vitamins (e.g., riboflavin, B12, beta-carotene); and hormones. Preferred fermentation processes include alcohol fermentation processes, as are well known in the art. Preferred fermentation processes are anaerobic fermentation processes, as are well known in the art. Processes for Producing Fermentation Products from Un-Gelatinized Starch-Containing In this aspect the invention relates to processes for producing a fermentation product from starch-containing material without gelatinization of the starch-containing material (i.e., uncooked starch-containing material). In one embodiment only a glucoamylase of the invention is used during saccharification and fermentation. According to the invention the desired fermentation product, such as ethanol, can be produced without liquefying the aqueous slurry containing the starch-containing material. In one embodiment a process of the invention includes saccharifying (milled) starch-containing material, e.g., granular starch, below the gelatinization temperature in the presence of a glucoamylase of the invention to produce sugars that can be fermented into the desired fermentation product by a suitable fermenting organism. Accordingly, in this aspect the invention relates to a process for producing a fermentation product from starch-containing material comprising: (a) saccharifying starch-containing material with a mature glucoamylase comprised in SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6, preferably the sequence shown as amino acids 19 to 573 in SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 6 or a glucoamylase having at least 90%, more preferably at least 91%, more preferably at least 92%, even more preferably at least 93%, most preferably at least 94%, and even most preferably at least 95%, such as at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or even 100% identity thereto, at a temperature below the initial gelatinization temperature of said starch-containing material, (b) fermenting using a fermenting organism. Steps (a) and (b) of the process of the invention may be carried out sequentially or simultaneously. In an embodiment a slurry comprising water and starch-containing material is prepared before step (a). The fermentation process may be carried out for a period of 1 to 250 hours, preferably is from 25 to 190 hours, more preferably from 30 to 180 hours, more preferably from 40 to 170 hours, even more preferably from 50 to 160 hours, yet more preferably from 60 to 150 hours, even yet more preferably from 70 to 140 hours, and most preferably from 80 to 130 hours. The term “initial gelatinization temperature” means the lowest temperature at which gelatinization of the starch commences. Starch heated in water begins to gelatinize between 50° C. and 75° C.; the exact temperature of gelatinization depends on the specific starch, and can readily be determined by the skilled artisan. Thus, the initial gelatinization temperature may vary according to the plant species, to the particular variety of the plant species as well as with the growth conditions. In the context of this invention the initial gelatinization temperature of a given starch-containing material is the temperature at which birefringence is lost in 5% of the starch granules using the method described by Gorinstein and Lii, 1992, Starch/Stärke 44(12): 461-466. Before step (a) a slurry of starch-containing material, such as granular starch, having 10-55 wt. % dry solids, preferably 25-40 wt. % dry solids, more preferably 30-35 wt. % dry solids of starch-containing material may be prepared. The slurry may include water and/or process waters, such as stillage (backset), scrubber water, evaporator condensate or distillate, side stripper water from distillation, or other fermentation product plant process water. Because the process of the invention is carried out below the gelatinization temperature and thus no significant viscosity increase takes place, high levels of stillage may be used if desired. In an embodiment the aqueous slurry contains from about 1 to about 70 vol. % stillage, preferably 15-60 vol. % stillage, especially from about 30 to 50 vol. % stillage. The starch-containing material may be prepared by reducing the particle size, preferably by dry or wet milling, to 0.05 to 3.0 mm, preferably 0.1-0.5 mm. After being subjected to a process of the invention at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or preferably at least 99% of the dry solids of the starch-containing material is converted into a soluble starch hydrolysate. The process of the invention is conducted at a temperature below the initial gelatinization temperature. Preferably the temperature at which step (a) is carried out is between 30-75° C., preferably between 45-60° C. In a preferred embodiment step (a) and step (b) are carried out as a sequential or simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process. In such preferred embodiment the process is typically carried at a temperature between 25° C. and 40° C., such as between 29° C. and 35° C., such as between 30° C. and 34° C., such as around 32° C. According to the invention the temperature may be adjusted up or down during fermentation. In an embodiment simultaneous saccharification and fermentation is carried out so that the sugar level, such as glucose level, is kept at a low level such as below 6 wt. %, preferably below about 3 wt. %, preferably below about 2 wt. %, more preferred below about 1 wt. %, even more preferred below about 0.5 wt. %, or even more preferred 0.25% wt. %, such as below about 0.1 wt. %. Such low levels of sugar can be accomplished by simply employing adjusted quantities of enzyme and fermenting organism. A skilled person in the art can easily determine which quantities of enzyme and fermenting organism to use. The employed quantities of enzyme and fermenting organism may also be selected to maintain low concentrations of maltose in the fermentation broth. For instance, the maltose level may be kept below about 0.5 wt. % or below about 0.2 wt. %. The process of the invention may be carried out at a pH in the range between 3 and 7, preferably from pH 3.5 to 6, or more preferably from pH 4 to 5. Starch-Containing Materials Any suitable starch-containing starting material, including granular starch, may be used according to the present invention. The starting material is generally selected based on the desired fermentation product. Examples of starch-containing starting materials, suitable for use in a process of present invention, include tubers, roots, stems, whole grains, corns, cobs, wheat, barley, rye, milo, sago, cassava, tapioca, sorghum, rice, peas, beans, or sweet potatoes, or mixtures thereof, or cereals, sugar-containing raw materials, such as molasses, fruit materials, sugar cane or sugar beet, potatoes, and cellulose-containing materials, such as wood or plant residues, or mixtures thereof. Contemplated are both waxy and non-waxy types of corn and barley. The term “granular starch” means raw uncooked starch, i.e., starch in its natural form found in cereal, tubers or grains. Starch is formed within plant cells as tiny granules insoluble in water. When put in cold water, the starch granules may absorb a small amount of the liquid and swell. At temperatures up to 50° C. to 75° C. the swelling may be reversible. However, with higher temperatures an irreversible swelling called “gelatinization” begins. Granular starch to be processed may be a highly refined starch quality, preferably at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97% or at least 99.5% pure or it may be a more crude starch containing material comprising milled whole grain including non-starch fractions such as germ residues and fibers. The raw material, such as whole grain, is milled in order to open up the structure and allowing for further processing. Two milling processes are preferred according to the invention: wet and dry milling. In dry milling whole kernels are milled and used. Wet milling gives a good separation of germ and meal (starch granules and protein) and is often applied at locations where the starch hydrolysate is used in production of syrups. Both dry and wet milling is well known in the art of starch processing and is equally contemplated for the process of the invention. The starch-containing material is reduced in particle size, preferably by dry or wet milling, in order to expose more surface area. In an embodiment the particle size is between 0.05 to 3.0 mm, preferably 0.1-0.5 mm, or so that at least 30%, preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 70%, even more preferably at least 90% of the starch-containing material fit through a sieve with a 0.05 to 3.0 mm screen, preferably 0.1-0.5 mm screen.

The amount of glucose is determined here by the glucose oxidase method for the activity determination. The method described in the section 76-11 Starch-Glucoamylase Method with Subsequent Measurement of Glucose with Glucose Oxidase in “Approved methods of the American Association of Cereal Chemists”. Vol. 1-2 AACC, from American Association of Cereal Chemists, (2000); ISBN: 1-891127-12-8.
