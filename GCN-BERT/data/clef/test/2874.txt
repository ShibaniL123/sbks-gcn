FIELD OF THE INVENTION [003] The present invention relates to physical exercise machines and more particularly to an exercise apparatus that enables users to perform an arm curl exercise that is resisted by a resistance mechanism. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [004] Exercise machines for exercising bicep muscles are known where the user is forced to engage a handle that rotates forcing the user to exert force via wrist and muscles other than the biceps. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [005] The state of the art for weight machines for training the biceps muscles in an arm curl pattern is primarily centered in two different configurations. One method is a cable based exercise where there is either a single resistive cable and handle or dual resistive cables with handles for each. The cable allows for varying patterns to be created and cover a wide variety of user sizes without adjustments to the machine. The second method is to have either a fixed or rotating grip on the end of a resisted arm, typically with an axis of rotation that is coincident with the axis of rotation of the elbow. This arm based method allows for a variety of grip positions during the movement of elbow flexion. This is important in biceps training since rotation of the wrist during the flexion exercise affects the length of the biceps and will affect the outcome. Aside from the benefits listed above, each method also has subsequent limitations. The limitation of the cable based method is it does not allow the grip to rotate in multiple planes of motion. This does not afford the supination/pronation opportunity at the wrist to allow for maximum length change of the biceps during arm flexion and therefore is not a preferred method. The single axis arm method does allow for wrist movement but does not afford the variability in the movement pattern to fit different sized and shaped individuals without significant adjustments. It also does not allow the user to choose their own user defined path of motion since a single axis machine primarily accomplishes a machine defined path of motion. An apparatus and method according to the invention has the benefit of a variable path of motion that the cable based machine offers in addition to allowing the wrist to supinate and pronate (rotate around the longitudinal axis of the forearm) without additional stresses being placed on the wrist. A method and apparatus according to the invention employs at least: a two link arm that has a fixed pivot behind the user and a dual axis pivot at its elbow. This allows the arm to move in any direction the user desires to complete the arm flexion exercise. The present method and apparatus of the invention also automatically adjusts to the users arm length due to the fact that arm is not loaded around a single pivot but instead has two links. Because the forward link cannot rotate around its longitudinal axis, the invention allows for a multi axis grip that affords any wrist position without subsequent adverse torque reactions at the wrist. Resistive load is accomplished via a cable attached to the end of the second link, directly in line with the rotating grip without interfering with said grip. This allows for the preferred loading characteristics of a cable resistance with the multiple grip orientations afforded by a fixed arm machine. [006] In accordance with the invention there is provided an apparatus (10) for performing an arm curl exercise by a user (5) having a trunk (T1 ) having a longitudinal axis (LA), opposing anterior (AS) and posterior (PS) sides and arms (13) with elbows (13e) extending from the trunk (T1 ), the apparatus comprising: a frame (12), a seat (16) having a seating surface (S), an elbow pad (19) having an engaging surface (ES), an input arm assembly (24) interconnected to a resistance mechanism (42) and a manually graspable mechanism (30h), the input arm assembly being pivotably mounted on the frame for back and forth travel along a generally upward (UW) to downward (DW) and forward (FW) to rearward (RW) direction, the input arm assembly (24) being adapted to reside in a start motionless position (SMP) relative to a selected arrangement of the seat (16) and elbow pad (19), the seat (16) being arranged relative to the input arm assembly (24) to position the user in a user start position (USP) that enables the user to manually engage the manually graspable mechanism (30h) when the user is seated in an orientation where a posterior surface (PSE) of the user's elbow user's elbow (13e) is engaged with the engaging surface (ES) of the elbow pad (19) and the anterior side of the user's trunk is oriented in a generally forward (FW) direction, the input arm assembly comprising a first arm (30r) being rotatably pivotable around a first linear axis (AA) starting from the start exercise position (SEP) through a generally forward to rearward or downward to upward path of travel under resistance (R1 ) exerted by the resistance mechanism on application of upwardly or rearwardly directed force (RUF) by the user (5) on the manually graspable mechanism (30h), the input arm assembly comprising a second arm (30f) rotatably pivotable around a second linear axis (AAA) along a generally forward to rearward or downward to upward path of travel under resistance (R1 ) exerted by the resistance mechanism on application of upwardly or rearwardly directed force (RUF) by the user (5) on the manually graspable mechanism (30h).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [062] In an exemplary embodiment, as shown in Figs. 1 , 2 an arm curl apparatus 10 of the present invention includes a support frame 12 on which a user support structure 14 is mounted. The user support structure 14 includes a seat surface 16 and a back rest 18. The seat 16 is mounted on the frame 12 facing away from a pair of laterally disposed input arm assemblies 24 comprised of a pair of arm portions, a first arm portion 30r rotatably mounted to the frame for rotation around an axis AA disposed at an acute angle X relative to horizontal and a second arm portion 30f rotatably mounted to a distal end of the first arm portion for rotation around both a second axis AAA that is generally parallel to the axis AA and around a third axis Z that is generally perpendicular to axis AA. [063] The apparatus includes handles or manually graspable mechanisms 30h that are comprised of a link support 30I that is rotatably mounted for rotation around a fourth axis Y that is generally parallel to axis AA and a hand grip 30hg rotatable around a fifth axis YY that is generally perpendicular to axis Y to enable the user to readily rotate the handles 30h without resistance when pulling RUF, LF on the handles 30h to move the arms 30r, 30f. [064] The arms 30r, 30f are mounted to the frame 12 and are arranged and adapted so as to be interconnected via cable 47, 48 and pulley mechanisms to a weight resistance (in this embodiment a weight stack 42) that exerts an opposing resistance R1 , R1 a against pivoting of arms 30r and 30f around axes AA, AAA and Z. The weight stack 42 is selectively connectable to one end of a cable 48 by inserting a pin 42p in one of a plurality of holes in a lifting post 50 that passes vertically through the plates 42w as is well known in the art. For example, the weight stack 42 is formed by a stack of rectangular, brick-shaped plates 42w. Each plate 42w further has at least one horizontal channel or hole, wherein a pin 42p may be disposed to slidably engage any of a series of horizontal channels which are vertically oriented on the lifting post 50 in a spaced apart manner to match the vertical spacing of the stacked weight plates 42w. The pin 42p thereby engages a portion of the stack of weight plates 42w, such that when vertical force is applied to the lifting post 50, the selected stack of weight plates 42w is moved upwards to create a resistance R1 , R1 a to pivoting of arms 30f, 30r around axes AA, AAA and Z. Typically, the weight stack 42 apparatus is oriented such that the further down the pin is entered into the lifting post 50, the greater the number of plates 42w are engaged, thereby increasing the resistance R1 of the machine 10. [065] In alternative embodiments, other mechanisms for providing resistance, such as friction fittings, springs, elastic bands, pneumatic or electromagnetic resistance, or an air resistance fan could be employed (either alone or in combination) and still practice the invention. Additionally, free weights could be operably engaged to the transmission assembly to resist the movement. [066] The seat 16 is mounted on the frame 12 in a position relative to the ground such that a user can sit on the seat with the user's feet 9 touching the ground. The back rest 18 is mounted to the frame 12 relative to the seat 16 such that the user can engage the user's back PS against the back rest 18 when seated on the seat 16. [067] A pair of elbow pads 19 are mounted to the frame in a position or disposition that is space laterally away from a midline MID relative to the seat 16 and backrest 18 in an arrangement. The arrangement of the seat 16 and elbow pads 19 are adapted such that a user 5 seated on the seat 16 can engage the posterior surface PSE of the user's elbows against the engaging surface ES of the elbow pads 19 when seated without having to make any adjustments in vertical or horizontal positioning of the seat 16 and pads 19 regardless of the size or configuration of the user 5. [068] The input arm assembly 24 is comprised of a pair of pivotable arms 30r, 30f having a pair of handles 30h comprised of grips 30hg and handle links 30I mounted to a distal end 30d of the pivotable arms 30f. The arms 30r, 30f are mounted and adapted to dispose the grips 30hg and handles 30h in a start exercise or rest position SEP forwardly of FW and vertically below DW the point of engagement of the posterior surface PSE of the user's elbows with the engaging surface ES of the elbow pads 19 as well as the seat 16 surface S. [069] The anterior or front arm portion 30f of the assembly 24 is connected to the manually selectively adjustable weight resistance mechanism 42 via or through the posterior or rear arm portion 30r. As shown, the rear arm 30r is mounted to the frame 12e at a position that is disposed rearwardly RW of the front to rear position of the seat 16 and elbow pads 19. Rear arm 30r is pivotable around axis AA which as shown in the embodiments of Figs. 1 -7 is disposed at an angle X relative to horizontal H, Fig. 3 such that the path of travel of arm 30r on movement upwardly and rearwardly beginning from the start motionless position SMP is laterally inwardly LATI, Figs. 6A, 6B toward the midline of the seat 16 and backrest 18 pivots. Similarly, front arm 30f is pivotable around both axis AA as well as an additional axis AAA that is generally parallel to axis AA. As shown front arm 30f is pivotably mounted on the forward distal end of arm 30r. Forward arm 30f is additionally pivotable around a separate axis Z formed by a dual axis hinge 30fb, 30fa, 30rb, 30ra mechanism such that front arm 30f is separately pivotable in the lateral SS direction enabling the user 5 to additionally pivot arm 30f laterally inwardly LATI around axis Z on applying lateral force LF when pulling the handles 30h rearwardly and upwardly RUF beginning from the start exercise SEP position of the handles 30h. Thus the arm assembly is comprised of an articulating arm assembly of arms 30r and 30f for pivoting around multiple axes AA, AAA and Z. [070] As shown, the input arm assembly 24 is interconnected to the resistance mechanism 42 at a point of interconnection 30de on the distal end of arm 30f that is spaced a first selected orthogonal distance FOD apart from the first linear axis AA selected to create a first selected torque resistance from the resistance mechanism against forward FW to rearward RW movement of the input arm assembly and is spaced a second selected orthogonal distance SOD from the third linear axis Z selected to create a second selected torque resistance from the resistance mechanism against lateral force LF and side to side SS movement of the second arm 30f.
