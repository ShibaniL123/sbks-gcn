BACKGROUND OF INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to foot coverings and more particularly to a new and useful disposable waterproof oversock which is adapted to protect a wearer's feet and socks while wearing footwear in conditions that may be wet, dirty, soiled or otherwise hazardous. 2. Background of the Related Art The use of socks as a foot covering inside shoes, boots, or other footwear is well known in the prior art. Socks may serve any of several purposes, including maintaining the warmth of feet, preventing injuries to feet due to abrasion with the inner surfaces or edges of footwear, or acting as a barrier between feet and undesirable matter that may penetrate into the footwear. Individuals, especially construction workers, utility workers and emergency response personnel, often find themselves operating in difficult environments. In some of these environments, individuals may be required to walk through damp or soiled areas, through puddles of standing water, and even through hazardous conditions in which standing water contains raw sewage or other hazardous materials. Individuals participating in recreational activities, such as hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, boating, and watersports, also confront similar conditions. Therefore, it is desirable to provide a solution that protects feet and socks from liquid and other undesirable elements that may penetrate footwear or reach above the ankle. During disaster relief efforts in particular, personnel are required to act quickly entering hazardous situations to save lives and prevent further damage. The delay in donning protective gear can cost precious moments. Therefore, it is desirable to provide a solution that allows protective gear to be applied and removed quickly in emergency situations. One common solution is for individuals to first insert their socked feet into any available plastic bags, such as those commonly provided by grocery stores or the bags in which loaves of sliced bread are sold, and then inserting their bag-covered feet into footwear. This solution provides only brief protection as these bags are not designed for this purpose. The durability of such coverings is unreliable, making the bags prone to rips and other failings after minimal abrasion inside footwear. Accordingly, it remains desirable to provide a solution for protecting feet and socks that is durable enough to endure the abrasive conditions expected inside footwear. Another disadvantage of this solution is that such coverings are prone to sagging, making it difficult to maintain the covering's desired position above an individual's ankle and around their calf. This causes problems when attempting to lower a pant leg over the covering, at which point the covering is likely to be pushed down and expose the ankle and lower leg. A further problem results as the bag sags during use and exposes the ankle and lower leg. In either circumstance, it is possible that the individual is unaware that the bag has sagged or that the ankle and lower leg would now be vulnerable if the individual were required to proceed through some depth of water. It remains desirable to provide a solution that permits the waterproof covering to maintain its position above the ankle while being applied and throughout use in working conditions. In an alternative approach, a sock composed of an elastic and waterproof material is provided. The elastic sleeve is pulled on over the individual's bare or socked foot. One significant concern in using an elasticized sleeve is that the elasticized material will cause difficulty in pulling the sleeve over a bare or socked foot. Another concern is that the elastic material would cause continuous and uncomfortable pressure on the foot. Therefore, it remains desirable to provide a waterproof solution that is not difficult to put on and that does not apply unnecessary pressure upon the foot. A further concern is that the cost of using the elasticized material would be prohibitive for a disposable item. As such, it remains desirable to provide a solution that is inexpensive and disposable. An additional solution provides a sock composed of one or more advanced materials that have wicking properties in addition to being waterproof or water-resistant. Such materials prevent moisture from the external environment from reaching the individual's foot and are capable of drawing any moisture developing inside the sock—as from natural foot perspiration—away from the foot to the exterior of the sock. While this solution offers varying degrees of success in protecting the foot and sock, it embodies several disadvantages. One disadvantage of this solution is that the materials employed are prohibitively expensive for use in a disposable solution. A further disadvantage of this solution is that it will be tempting to reuse such an expensive item, causing some to attempt to clean the sock even after it has been exposed to unknown and potentially hazardous contaminants. An individual using such a sock will have been spared contact with undesirable substances during use, only to be unnecessarily exposed to the same substances in attempting to clean it for additional use. Accordingly, it remains desirable to provide a solution that is inexpensive enough to discourage individuals from attempting to clean a soiled sock. Another disadvantage of this solution is that it causes the accumulation of moisture within the oversock. The accumulation of moisture inside an oversock is noted particularly in socks and oversocks that fit snugly around the foot. As such, it is the expensive wicking materials used in snugly fitting socks that are contributing to the moisture problem they claim to address. Therefore, it remains desirable to provide a solution that does not encourage the accumulation of moisture within the oversock. Yet another disadvantage of a solution that utilizes a snugly fitted oversock is that such oversocks are difficult to slide over the foot and ankle as they are being put on and removed. It is thus desirable to provide a solution that allows the oversock to be put on and removed easily. A further disadvantage of this solution is that many of the advanced materials used in this solution are not recyclable. Therefore, it remains desirable to provide a solution that uses readily recyclable materials. It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide a waterproof oversock that will protect a wearer's foot and sock from becoming wet, soiled or contaminated from contact with external conditions that penetrate the wearer's footwear. Another object of this invention is to provide a waterproof oversock that protects a wearer's leg and sock above the ankle when submerged in standing water or other bodies of liquid. A further object of this invention is to provide a waterproof oversock that maintains its position about the ankle during dressing and ordinary usage. Still another object of this invention is to provide a waterproof oversock that will discourage the accumulation of moisture. It is also an object of this invention to provide a waterproof oversock that does not cause discomfort to the wearer's foot during ordinary use. Another object of this invention is to provide a waterproof sock that is easy to put on and remove. A further object of this invention is to provide a waterproof oversock that is disposable and recyclable. SUMMARY OF INVENTION Accordingly, the present invention contemplates a new and improved waterproof oversock, and more particularly, a disposable oversock that is easy to put on and which stays in place above the ankle. The invention eliminates the above-discussed and other drawbacks of the currently employed solutions. The invention solves the problem of feet and socks becoming wet and soiled by providing a waterproof oversock that serves as a durable and impermeable barrier to external elements. The problem of maintaining such protection above the ankle is solved by providing a recess within the oversock that encompasses the wearer's calf area and contributes to securing the oversock in position about the lower leg. The problem of maintaining such protection above the ankle is further solved by providing a means for easily and adjustably securing the oversock in position above and about the ankle. The problem of difficulty putting on a tight fitting elastic sock is solved by providing an oversized oversock that slips easily over a foot even when wearing a thick sock directly on the foot. The problem of moisture build-up inside the oversock is solved by providing an oversized oversock that does not hold the foot tightly. The problem of risking contamination by attempting to clean the oversock is solved by providing an oversock that is disposable and recyclable. The invention is particularly suited for use by emergency personnel in disaster relief efforts. The waterproof oversock can be applied quickly without significantly impacting the response times of disaster relief personnel. Similarly, the waterproof oversock may be removed with ease and speed regardless of the presence of additional protective gear or equipment. Furthermore, the generous capacity of the oversock provides the option for it to be worn over the pant leg, extending its protection the bottom of the pant leg in addition to the wearer's foot, ankle and sock. In one embodiment, a waterproof oversock is provided that is loose fitting about the foot and with a means of securing the oversock about the ankle. In another embodiment, a waterproof oversock is provided with a seamless surface. In a further embodiment, a waterproof oversock is provided with a plurality of points for securing the oversock in place about the ankle.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings that are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the description herein to specific embodiments is not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous decisions specific to any particular implementation must be made to achieve the developers' goals, such as compliance with regulatory constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. The oversock components discussed herein may be composed of any of a number of sufficiently strong materials and may be formed or constructed by any of a number of processes. Nothing in the descriptions of the embodiments below is intended to be a limitation in the possible materials to be used in constructing any form of this invention. FIG. 1 is a side view of a first side of an embodiment of an oversock 100. FIG. 2 is a side view of a second side of an embodiment of Oversock 100. In this first embodiment, oversock 100 is comprised of two layers, layer 102 being visible in FIG. 1 and layer 103 being visible in FIG. 2. Layers 102 and 103 are comprised of polyethylene that is at least 0.003 inches thick. Without doubt, any of a number of other materials meeting the requirements and characteristics of the preferred material could be employed. Either the first side or the second side may be described as the left side or right side of Oversock 100 as worn on a foot. Similarly, as worn on a foot, either first or second side may be described as the interior or exterior of the foot and leg upon which Oversock 100 is worn. Oversock 100 has the general shape of an oversized traditional sock with a wider opening than is traditionally provided. This embodiment of oversock 100 further diverges from a traditional sock shape by providing an enlarged calf region 104. As worn, calf region 104 creates a recess in which the wearer's calf rests. Calf region 104 surrounds the wearer's calf, providing a more comfortable fit and additional support against sagging. Oversock 100 may be provided in a range of foot or shoe sizes with the understanding, however, that Oversock 100 is oversized relative to the size of the intended foot to which it will be applied. Wearer's foot will rest within region 105 of oversock 100. The profile of Oversock 100 is defined by an upper edge 110 and seam 120 along the remaining perimeter of Oversock 100. Seam 120 is formed by heat sealing or a similarly effective means of manufacture. As an artifact of manufacture, seam 120 may appear to continue along upper edge 110. However, layers 102 and 103 are not joined at upper edge 110. Upper edge 110 defines the opening of Oversock 100 into which a wearer's foot would be inserted. Strips 135 and 136 comprise a hook and loop fastening system, wherein strip 135 comprises a surface of fastening material such as a loop surface and strip 136 comprises a surface of fastening material such as a hook surface. Oversock 100 is secured about a calf by folding the portion of Oversock 100 with strip 136 onto strip 135. Reinforcing strip 160 is securely affixed to Oversock 100 in the vicinity of upper edge 110 approximately 2.5 inches below upper edge 110. Reinforcing strip 160 may be comprised of either a single strip affixed to both the first side and second side of Oversock 100 or two or more strips attached individually to both the first side and second side of Oversock 100. Reinforcing strip 170 is securely affixed to Oversock 100 at ankle region 106. Reinforcing strip 170 may be comprised of either a single strip affixed to both the first side and second side of Oversock 100 or two or more strips attached individually to both the first side and second side of Oversock 100. Strip 136 may be pulled and selectively attached along the width of strip 135. This individual adjustment allows the wearer to adjustably secure oversock 100 about a range of calf sizes and to customize the positioning to match wearer's desired fit. The rigidity of strips 135 and 136, individually and when secured together, prevent flap region 153 of Oversock 100 from sagging about wearer's calf and ankle. Region 105 remains loose about wearer's foot before and after being secured. Once secured about wearer's foot, ankle, and calf, Oversock 100 looks, feels, and behaves similar to a standard sock. The wearer may then insert an Oversock-enclosed foot into any other footwear. The low friction properties of layers 102 and 103 allow the Oversock and foot to be slipped into footwear with minimal resistance. FIG. 3 is a side view of a first side of a second embodiment of an Oversock 100. FIG. 4 is a side view of a second side of a second embodiment of Oversock 100. In this second embodiment, strips 135 and 136 continue to comprise a hook and loop fastening system used to selectively secure Oversock 100 about wearer's ankle. Reinforcing strip 160 further comprises two ends, and reinforcing strip 170 further comprises two ends. Upper tab 131 is securely attached to Oversock 100 in the vicinity of a first end of reinforcing strip 160. Upper tab 132 is securely attached to Oversock 100 in the vicinity of a second end of reinforcing strip 160. Lower tab 141 is securely attached to Oversock 100 in the vicinity of a first end of reinforcing strip 170. Lower tab 142 is securely attached to Oversock 100 in the vicinity of a second end of reinforcing strip 170. Upper tabs 131 and 132 comprise a hook and loop fastening system. Upper tabs 131 and 132 may be pulled and selectively attached to each other. This individual adjustment allows the wearer to further adjustably secure Oversock 100 about a range of calf sizes and to customize how firmly it is secured about the calf. Lower tabs 141 and 142 comprise a hook and loop fastening system. Lower tabs 141 and 142 may be pulled and selectively attached to each other. This individual adjustment allows the wearer to further adjustably secure Oversock 100 about a range of ankle sizes and to customize how firmly it is secured about the ankle. The particular embodiments disclosed above are illustrative only, as the invention may be modified and practiced in different but equivalent manners apparent to those skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings herein. Furthermore, no limitations are intended to the details of construction or design herein shown, other than as described in the claims below.
