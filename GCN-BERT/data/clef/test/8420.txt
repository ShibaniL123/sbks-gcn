Synthesis of Compound 28
Succinimidyl 4-(azidomethyl)benzoate [1] (793 mg, 2.89 mmol) and 6-aminohexanol (538 mg, 4.59 mmol, 1.6 eq.) were dissolved in MeOH (30 ml), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature. The disappearance of the raw material was confirmed by TLC (EtOAc, UV, anisaldehyde) after 1 hour. The reaction solution was diluted with ethyl acetate and subjected to liquid-liquid extraction with 1 N HCl and distilled water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and distilled under reduced pressure. Then, flash column chromatography (chloroform:methanol=100:0â†’100:1) was performed. A compound 28 (422 mg, 1.53 mmol, 53%) was obtained as a white powder.
