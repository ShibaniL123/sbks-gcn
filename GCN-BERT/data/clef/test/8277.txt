Methods and Compositions for Enhancing the Uptake of Therapeutic Agents by Target Cells Field of Invention The present invention relates to a new use of a known medicament. Specifically, the invention relates to methods and compositions for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of a therapeutic agent by increasing the uptake of the therapeutic agent by target cells, and in particular relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a regulating agent of lipid raft/eaveoiae-dependeni endocytic pathway and some therapeutic agents, such as anti-tumor agents. The invention also relates to a method for screening a regulating agent of lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway capable of enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of anti-tumor agents. Background of Invention Tumor growth and migration are dependent on angiogenesis and iymphangiogenesis. Therefore, tumor angiogenic and iymphangiogenic endothelial cells have emerged as new targets for cancer therapeutics (Folkman, J. Ν Engl J Med 1971 ; 285:1182-1186, Witte ΜΗ et al, Lymphoiogy. 1987; 20(4);257-66). Meanwhile, it has been shown that abnormal angiogenesis is also involved in a variety of diseases including obesity, diabetic retinopathy, persistent hyperplastic vitreous, psoriasis, allergic dermatitis, arthritis, arteriosclerosis, endometriosis, asthma, ascites, and peritoneal adhesion (Carmeiiet Ρ., Nature Medicine 2003; 9(6): 653-660). Endostatin (ES) is a 20 kDa C-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII and is an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis and Iymphangiogenesis. ES can inhibit the proliferation and migration of angiogenic and Iymphangiogenic endothelial cells, and thus can impede the formation of new blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. It has been shown that recombinant endostatin can inhibit the growth and metastasis of various types of tumors without eliciting drug resistance in animal models (Folkman J, et al. Cell 1997; 88:277-285, Folkman J. et al, Nature 1997; 390:404-407, Zhuo W. et al, Journal of Pathology; 222:249-260). Recently, a recombinant human endostatin, Endu, containing an extra N-terminal (M)GGSHHHHH amino acid residues compared to. the natural endostatin, has been widely used and tested In clinic for the treatment of multiple types of cancers, especially non-small ceil lung cancer. It has been shown that ES can be internalized by activated angiogenic and iymphangiogenic endothelial cells, However, the specific mechanism remains unclear. Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed on the surface of various types of tumor cells and is closely related to the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. Several monoclonal antibodies against EGFR have been developed as antitumor therapeutics. For example. Cetuximah is a monoclonal antibody of EGFR that specifically binds to cell surface EGFR of tumor cells. Cetuximab has been used for the treatment of certain cancers. Nystatin (NT) is a polyene antibiotic that is used as a broad spectrum antifungal drug in human. It can be orally or topically applied, without any interaction with other drags. NT has high efficacy against Candida, while other fungi, including cryptococcus neoformans, aspergillus, mucor, microsporum, histoplasma capsulatum, blastomyces dermatitidis, dermatophytes are usually sensitive to NT as well. NT is also commonly used as a prophylactic treatment in patients prone to fungal infection, such as AIDS patients and patients undergoing chemotherapy. The mechanism of nystatin and its analogs (e.g., amphotericin Β) is that they can bind with, ergosterol on the fungus cell membrane, resulting in membrane perforation, potassium leakage, and subsequently the death of fungus, Since ergosterol is a unique lipid composition of fungus ceil membrane, NT and amphotericin Β will not affect eukaryotic cell membrane when applied to human or animals. NT can influence the cholesterol-dependent endocytosis of cells and has been used as a specific inhibitor of lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytie pathway. Since cholesterol is required for lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytie pathway, NT can bind with cell surface membrane cholesterol, thus inhibiting this pathway. Amphotericin Β, methyi-p-cyclodextrin, and fllipin have a similar function to that of NT and can also inhibit lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytie pathway by affecting cholesterol. Amphotericin: Β (ΑΜΒ) has the same function as NT and is used for the treatment of cryptococcus and aspergillus infection, Wickstrorn et al (2002, 2003) reported that in endothelial cells, ES can bind to integrin alphaSbetal and caveolin (the structural protein of caveolae) in lipid rafts, radicating the correlation between ES and lipid raft (Wickstrorn et al, Cancer Res. 2002;62: 55S0-9, Wickstrorn et al, J, Biol. Chem, 2003;278(39): 37895-37901). In addition, Dixeiius et al (2000), Shi et al (2007), and Zhuo et al (2010) respectively reported that ES can be specifically internalized in angiogenic and lymphangiogenic endothelial cells (Dixeiius et al, Blood 2000, 95, 3403-3411; Shi et al, Blood 2007, 110, 2899-2906, Zhuo W. et al, Journal of Pathology; 222:249-260). In 2002, Pike et al and Roepsiorff et al found that the cell surface binding of epithelial growth factor (EOF), the ligand of EGFR, can be increased by inhibition of cholesterol and lipid rafts (Pike et al, Biochemistry 2002;4ΐ: 10315-22, Roepstorff et al, J Biol Chem 2002:277: 18954-60). Kojic et al (2008) reported tot tumor cells can internalize AMF/PGI through the lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytie- pathway. In addition, this endocytio process is cell-type specific, indicating that Lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytosis might provide a drug delivery route specifically targeting tumor cells (Kojic et al, PLoS ONE 2008;3; ℮3597). MigaJovich et al (2009) reported that NT increases the uptake of daidzeln-BSA by ovarian cancer cells through regulating lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytosis. Daidzein-BSA is a potential tumor imaging agent. By increasing the-uptake of daidzein-BSA by tumor cells, NT may improve the effects of this tumor imaging agent in tumor imaging (Migalovich et al. Cancer Res. 2009;69: 5610-5617). In conclusion, lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytosis may be involved in. the uptake of many important molecules including cytokines, exogenous proteins,, and even therapeutic compounds. Regulating and manipulating such endocytie procedures at a cellular level may influence the uptake of these substances in a subject, which may find a potential application for drug delivery. Summary of Invention The invention is based on the following discovery. ES can be internalized by endothelial cells through both lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytie pathway and clathrin-coated pit endocytie pathway,. The inventors surprisingly found that inhibiting lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytie pathway with NT leads to an unexpected result that the uptake of ES by angiogenic and lymphangiogemc endothelial cells is increased, resulting in an emhanced inhibitory effect of ES on endothelial cells, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor growth. Without being bound by theory, it is speculated that the inhibition of lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytie pathway leads to the compensatory activation of the highly efficient clathrin-coated pit endocytie pathway, resulting in an increased overall endocytosis of ES. Similarly, ligands ofEGTR have been shown to have a similar endocytie machinery to ES, For example, monoclonal antibody against EGFR is a potent antitumor agent that inhibits the signal activation and tumor proliferation by specifically binding to EGFR on tumor ceil surface. The inventors found that, by affecting Bpid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytosis, NT significantly enhances the uptake of EGFR monoclonal antibody by tumor cells, leading to enhanced therapeutic efficacy of this antibody. These findings indicate the potential use of NT in turner therapy and imaging. Furthermore, there are many protein drugs sharing a similar endocytie pattern like ES, including endothelin receptor type A, cholera toxin, transforming growth, factor-p receptors, Β cell antigen receptor, bone morphogenetic protein receptor, ΗΜ 1.24, and integrals. These proteins all. have the potential to be used in combination with NT to achieve an enhanced therapeutic effect. Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides the use of a regulating agent of lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway in preparing a pharmaceutical composition for increasing the uptake of a therapeutic agent by a target cell in a subject. In another aspect, the invention provides the use of an inhibitor of the lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway in preparing a pharmaceutical composition for increasing the uptake of a therapeutic agent by a target cell in a subject, wherein the inhibitor inhibits the lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway in the target cell, and wherein the therapeutic agent, in the absence of the inhibitor, is capable of being taken in by the target cell via lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway and clathrin-coated pit endocytic pathway. In another aspect, the invention provides a method of increasing the uptake of a therapeutic agent by a target cell in a subject, comprising the step of administering a regulating agent of lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway to the subject.

In another aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a regulating agent of lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway and a therapeutic agent, such as an antitumor agent. In specific embodiments of the aforementioned aspects of this invention, the regulating agent of lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway is an inhibitor of lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway. Examples of such inhibitors are polyene antifungal drugs (for example, NT or ΑΜΒ), methyl-P-cyclodextrin, or filipin. According to this invention, the aforementioned therapeutic agent is one which can be internalized by a target cell through both lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway and clathrin-coated pit endocytic pathway.

The ES can be a native endostatin or a recombinant endostatin (such as recombinant human endostatin). In a specific embodiment of this invention, the ES has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO.l, SEQ ID NO.2, SEQ ID Ν0.3, or SEQ ID Ν0.4. In a further embodiment of this invention, the ES derivatives are PEG-modified endo statin. Preferably, the PEG is monomethoxy PEG with an average molecular weight of 5-40 kDa.

According to this invention, the therapeutic agent is an antibody capable of inhibiting the growth of tumors. In a specific embodiment of this invention, the antibody is EGFR antibody, such as a monoclonal antibody against EGFR. An example of the monoclonal antibodies against EGFR is Cetuximab.

Detailed Description The present invention provides a new use for a broad-spectrum polyene antibiotic Nystatin (NT) and similar agents. In addition, the present invention provides new pharmaceutical compositions and methods of applying the same for enhancing the efficacy of therapeutic protein drugs, such as ES and EGFR monoclonal antibody, which are internalized by means of lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway and oiathrin-coafed pit. endocytic pathway. Lipid rafts are the micro-domains on plasma membrane rich in cholesterol and sphingomyelins. The saturated aliphatic chains of sphingomyelins and glycosphingolipids are clustered tightly and the gaps between the saturated aliphatic chains are filled with cholesterol as spacer molecules to form a liquid-ordered phase, he. lipid raft, which is about 50 nm in diameter. Lipid raft is a dynamic structure that has a close relationship with the cell membrane signal transduction and protein sorting. Caveolae (also known as membrane cave-like invagination or membrane microcapsules) refers to a form of lipid raft which has the same membrane lipids composition as lipid raft, but also contains caveolin (a small-molecular-weight protein, 2llcDa). Lipid raft/caveolae-dependent pathway does not require clathrin, Adipocytes, endothelial cells, epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells are abundant in caveolae which is involved in endocytosis. In addition, the presence of certain signal molecules in caveolae indicates that it is associated with cell signal transduction, Clathrin-coated pits are dynamic membrane transporting structure formed during the process of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis, Endocytosis that are dependent on this type of structure is called the clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Angiogenesis-related diseases and lymphangiogenesis-related diseases are diseases closely related to abnormal angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, including cancer, autoimmune diseases like arthritis and psoriasis, diabetes, obesity and a variety of eye diseases. the inventors found that lipid raft/caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway inhibitor NT can significantly enhance the endoeytosis of ES in vascular endothelial cells when both NT and endostatin are added to the culture media of vascular endothelial cells. This enhancement effect is positively correlated with the concentrations of NT, Meanwhile, the same result was also observed in lymphatic endothelial cells. Further experiments revealed that this enhancement effect can also be achieved by other therapeutic agents and reagents with the similar action mechanism, to NT. As demonstrated in Example 1, a class of substances with the similar action mechanism to NT, such as amphotericin Β (ΑΜΒ), methylated p-cyclodextrin (Μβ-0Ο) and filipin, can also enhance the endoeytosis of ES in vascular endothelial cells, ΑΜΒ and filipin are antifungal antibiotics. Similar to NT, ΑΜΒ, Μβ-ΟΒ and filipin can significantly enhance the endoeytosis of ES in vascular endothelial cells, and this enhancement effect is positively correlated with the concentrati ons of these compounds. Moreover, the inventors found that NT can significantly enhance the endoeytosis of PEG-modified ES (PEG-ES), ES with additional amino acid sequence (M)GGSHHHHH at N-terminal (Endu), and Endu with PEG modification at N-terminal in endothelial cells, and this enhancement effect is positively correlated with the concentrations of NT. At the molecular cell biology level, the inventors demonstrated that. NT can promote the endoeytosis of ES in endothelial cells, and further enhance the inhibitory effect of ES on endothelial cell survival related signaling pathways (such as ERK and ρ38 ΜΑΡΚ). At the cellular level, the inventors demonstrated that the combination of NT and ES can enhance the inhibitory effect of ES on endothelial cell migration activity. Further, using the Α549 lung cancer animal model and the FI22 liver cancer animal model, the inventors demonstrated that NT can enhance the inhibitory' effect of ES on tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis. In addition, it is found that NT can also enhance the uptake and distribution of ES in tumor tissues. The inventors also found that, EGFR monoclonal antibody has some similarities to ES in terms of its endocyiic mechanism, and its endoeytosis in tumor cells can also be modulated by NT. At the molecular cell biology level, the inventors demonstrated that NT can enhance the endoeytosis of EGFR monoclonal antibody in. cancer cells. Further, the inventors also demonstrated that combined treatment with NT and EGFR monoclonal antibody can improve the distribution and uptake of EGFR monoclonal antibody in xenograft tumor in mice. Accordingly, the invention provides a new use of antifungal antibiotic NT in a combined anticancer therapy to promote the uptake and efficacy of anticancer agents such as ES or EGFR monoclonal antibody. It may be used in cancer treatment and tumor imaging. Protein modification with polymers is a commonly used technique to change the dynamic characteristics of drugs, such as half-life, and to improve immunological characteristics and toxicological properties. Among the polymers, the polyethylene glycol (FECI) is the most commonly used protein modification molecule. The inventors proved that the endocytosis of endostatin (and its derivative Endu) modified with PEG (monomethoxy polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde) at the N-terminal a-amine was significantly increased in endothelial ceils by NT. This fact provides a theoretical basis for the combination therapy of NT and modified or labeled ES or its derivatives to achieve, a synergistic effect The inventors also demonstrated that this combined therapy can be extended to other drugs which have similar endoeytle pattern arid action mechanism to ES, Such drugs include substances which can target tumor or tumor vasculature and thus can be used for treatment or imaging purposes, such as EGFR monoclonal antibody and the modified, labeled EGFR monoclonal antibody. The uptake and efficacy of such substances can also he promoted when used in combination with polyene agents such as NT. The invention also provides a new formulation and pharmaceutical composition for the combined therapy of NT (or ΑΜΒ, etc.) and ES. ES is administered by intravenous infusion in cancer therapy. NT is a broad-spectrum antifungal polyene antibiotic, insoluble in water and difficult to be absorbed in gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, having high toxicity by direct injection. However, it has been shown that NT can be administered as an intravenous infusion by way of liposome encapsulation. For example, Aronex's NT liposomal formulation, Nyotran, completed phase HI clinical trials in 1999 and is expected to be commercialized in recent years. This will allow intravenous administration of NT, Both ΑΜΒ and NT belong to broad-spectrum antifungal polyene antibiotics, and they share the identical action mechanisms. To date, there are three kinds of amphotericin Β liposome formulations listed in European and American market (trade name: Abelcet, Amphocil and AmBisome, respectively), which achieve intravenous infusion for this kind of insoluble antibioties. Another liposomal amphotericin Β infusion formulation was also released in 2003, under the trade name Fungizone. Therefore, it is feasible to achieve the combination therapy of ES or EGFR monoclonal antibody with NT or ΑΜΒ by way of liposome formulations and intravenous administration. Examples Example 1: NT enhances the uptake and internalization of ES in blood vessel endothelial cells and lymphatic vessel endothelial cells. Human microvaseular endothelial cells (HMECs) were from ATCC (accession number CRL 10636). Mouse lymphatic endothelial cells (niLEC) were isolated via digesting peritoneal lymphoma induced by incomplete Freund’s adjuvant injection (Zhuo W. et al, Journal of Pathology; 222:249-260). Endu was obtained from Simcere-Medgenn Bio-pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Endu is a recombinant ES containing an additional amino acid sequence (M)GGSHHHHH at N-terminal, the sequence of which is SEQ ID NO.3 or SEQ ID NO.4 because the first amino acid residue Μ will be randomly deleted when expressed in Ε. Coli. ES was obtained from Protgen Ltd., the amino acid sequence of which is SEQ ID NO.l or SEQ ID NO.2 because the first amino acid residue Μ will be randomly deleted when expressed in Ε. Coli. Monomethoxy PEG propionaldehyde (mPEG-ALD) with an average molecular weight of 20 kDa (Jenkem Technology CO., Ltd.,) was used as the PEG reagent for specifically modifying the a-amino group at N-terminal of a protein. PEG-ES and PEG-Endu were prepared by Protgen Ltd. according to the instructions provided in the PEG reagent kit. Monoclonal antibody against ES was purchased from Oncogene Science, Inc. NT and other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. The endothelial cells were cultured to reach 90% confluence, and then pre-treated with DMEM medium (Hyclone) containing NT as follows. NT stock solution was added to the medium to a final concentration of 0 pg/mL, 25 pg/mL, or 50 pg/mL, and the culture was then incubated in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for 20 min for NT pre-treatment. After pre-treatment, ES stock solution (5mg/ml) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 5pg/mL. The culture was then incubated in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for 30 min to allow the internalization of ES by the endothelial cells. After removing the medium, the endothelial cells were washed with ice-cold PBS for 3 times and then collected. The ES internalization in whole cell lysate, cytosolic fraction, and nuclear fraction was examined by Western Blotting, compared with the cells without NT treatment. The results indicated that under the same ES dosage and treatment time, NT treatment significantly increased the ES internalization in whole cell lysate, cytosolic fraction, and nuclear fraction (Figure 1Α). The ES internalization was increased by about 2 folds and 15 folds in cells treated with NT at 25pg/mL and 50 pg/mL, respectively, and the increase of ES internalization was positively correlated to NT concentration (Figure 1Α). The mLECs were pre-treated with DMEM (Hyclone) containing 0, 75, 150, or 300 pg/mL NT in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for 20 min. The cells were then incubated with culture media containing ES (final concentration of 2 pg/mL) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for 15 min. After treatment, the cells were washed with PBS for 3 times, and then collected. The ES internalization in cells treated with NT at various concentrations was examined by Western Blotting. The results showed that treatment with NT at 75, 150, 300 pg/mL increased ES internalization in mLECs by 16-, 32- and 78-fold, respectively, and the increase of ES internalization was positively correlated to NT concentration (Figure IB). Some other agents which share the same action mechanism as NT were also tested in place of in this example, such as ΑΜΒ (25-50 pg/mL), methyl-P-cyclodextrin (1-2 mM), and filipin (2.5-5 pg/mL). The results showed that they can increase ES internalization in endothelial cells (Figure 1C). Other therapeutic agents which share the same action mechanism as ES can also be used in this example, such as PEG-modified ES. For this purpose, ES was modified with monomethoxy PEG propionaldehyde (mPEG-ALD) of 20 kDa which specifically modifies the N-terminal of a protein, and the product (PEG-ES) was an ES protein conjugated with one PEG molecule at the N-terminal a-amino group of ES. The results indicated that under the same PEG-ES dosage and treatment time, PEG-ES internalization in blood vessel endothelial cells was increased with NT treatment, and the increases were positively correlated to the NT concentrations (Figure ID). Similar results were also obtained in internalization experiment using other derivatives of ES, Endu and PEG-Endu (Endu conjugated with one PEG group on the N-terminal a-amino group). Under the same dosage and treatment time, Endu/PEG-Endu internalization in endothelial cells was increased with NT treatment, and the increases were positively correlated to the NT concentration (Figure IE). Example 2: NT increases the inhibitory effect of ES on endothelial cell signal pathways by enhancing ES internalization. Kim et al (2002) found that ES can inhibit the signal transduction pathways in endothelial cell mediated by extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), ρ38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (ΜΑΡΚ), and ρ125 focal adhesion kinase (ρ125 FAK), resulting in the inhibition of endothelial cell activity (Kim et al, J.Biol. Chem. 2002, 277, 27872-27879). In this example, the ERK and ρ38 ΜΑΡΚ pathways were taken as the markers of endothelial cell activation and it is found that the combination of NT and ES further elevated the inhibitory effect of ES on these pathways. In this example, endothelial cells were separated into four groups: (1) negative control group, neither NT treatment, nor ES treatment; (2) NT group, treatment with NT at 50 pg/mL for 20 min, without ES treatment; (3) ES group, treatment with ES at 5 pg/mL for 30 min, without NT treatment; (4) NT plus ES group, treatment with NT at 50 pg/mL for 20 min, followed by treatment with ES at 5 pg/mL for 30 min. After treatment with the same method as described in Example 1, cells were collected and the ERK and ρ38 ΜΑΡΚ pathways were examined. The results showed that compared with negative control group, NT treatment (NT group) did not influence the signal transduction of ERK and ρ38 ΜΑΡΚ pathways. ES treatment (ES group) inhibited the activation of ERK and ρ38. ΜΑΡΚ pathways, which is consistent with that reported by Kim et al. NT plus ES treatment (NT plus ES group) further enhanced the inhibitory effects of ES on the activation of ERK and ρ38 ΜΑΡΚ pathways. These results demonstrated that combined treatment with NT plus ES potentiated the inhibitory effect of ES on the activation of cell signaling pathways (Figure 2). Example 3: NT enhances the inhibitory effect of BS on endothelial cell migration. Cell, migration assay: HMEC (2 * JO4 cells per well) were seeded into DMEM (Hyclone) containing 0.5% FBS (Byclone.) and 10 ng/mL VEGF (PeproTech) on the upper layer of Transwell chambers (8 μΐπ pores. Costar). ES (40 pg/mL) or NT (50 pg/mL) was added into both the upper and lower layers, and then the chambers were incubated in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for 6 hours to allow cell migration. After giutaraldehyde fixation and crystal violet staining, 5 randomly selected fields in each well were observed with a microscopy (400 χ magnification, Olympus 1X71). The numbers of the cells migrated into the lower layer were counted and mean values were calculated, Experiments were- performed, in triplicate and each experiment was repeated twice. In this example, endothelial, cells were separated into four groups: (1) negative control group,, neither NT treatment, nor BS treatment; (2) NT group, treatment with NT at 50 pg/mL, without ES treatment; (3) ES group, treatment with ES at 40 pg/mL, without NT treatment; (4) NT plus ES group, combined treatment, with NT at SO pg/mL and ES at 40 pg/mL. The results showed that compared with negative control group, NT treatment (NT group) did not substantially influence the transwell migration of endothelial cells. ES treatment (ES group) inhibited the transwell migration of endothelial, cells by 61%. NT plus ES treatment (NT plus ES group) enhanced the inhibitory effect ofES on the- transweli migration of endothelial cells (inhibition rate 87%, Ρ < 0.001, NT plus ES group vs ES group). These results demonstrated that combined treatment with NT plus BS potentiated the inhibitory effect of ES on endothelial cell migration. Representative images of cell migration in each group were 'shown in Figure 3Α. Mean, values of migrated cell numbers were shown in Figure 3Β. Example 4; NT increases the uptake and distribution of ES in. tumor tissue, resulting in enhanced antitumor and antiangiogenesis efficacy of ES in animals. Human lung adenocarcinoma Α549 tumor cells (ATCC accession number CCL-185) at exponential growth were subcutaneously inoculated into 6-8 week-old nude mice (Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd). When the tumor volume reached 100 nutr, the tumor bearing nude mice were separated into four groups: (1) negative control,, treatment with saline; (2) NT group, treatment with NT (6mg/kg, intraperitoneal injections daily), without ES treatment; (3) ES group, treatment, with ES (12mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection, daily), without NT treatment; (4) NT plus ES group, combined treatment with NT (6mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection, daily) and ES (12mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection, daily), After fourteen daily injections, mice were sacrificed, and the weight and volume of the tumors were measured. The results indicated that compared with control group, NT treatment did not influence- tumor growth; ES treatment inhibited tumor growth by 40%. NT plus ES treatment enhanced the inhibitory effect of ES on tumor growth (inhibition rate 60%), These results demonstrated that N'T potentiated the inhibitory efficacy of ES on tumor growth (Figure 4Α), No abnormal changes, were observed in the animals in all groups in terras of weight, feeding and routine. Tumor blood vessel formation assay: Tumors from Α,549 mice were resected, fixed and sectioned. Samples were detected with primary antibody against CD31 (the marker of tumor blood vessel endothelial cells) and F1TC-labeled secondary antibody (Santa Cruz), and then observed with Nikon Α1 laser scanning eonfocal microscope (LSCM), The sectional areas of blood vessels in .randomly selected fields (400 χ.) were, quantified and averaged with the software of the LSCM system. The results showed that NT potentiated the inhibitory efficacy of ES on tumor blood vessel formation, which was similar to the inhibitory efficacy on tumor growth. Average tumor weight of each group was shown in Figure 4A. Average tumor blood vessel area (arbitrary unit) of each, group was shown in Figure 4Β, The enhancement effect of NT on the antitumor and antiangiogenesis activities of ES was also evidenced in Η22 liver cancer mouse model. Average tumor weight in each group was shown in. Figure 4C. Average tumor blood vessel area (arbitrary unit) in each group was shown in Figure 4D, No abnormal changes were observed in the animals in all groups in terms of weight, feeding and routine. Measurement of the uptake and distribution of fluorescent-labeled ES in tumor tissue of tumor-bearing mice: Human lung adenocarcinoma Α549 tumor cells at exponential growth were subcutaneously inoculated into 6-8 week-old nude mice (Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd). Tumor-bearing mice (η ≈ 4/group) were separated into two groups when the tumor volume reached 300 mm3. (1); ES group, treatment with Rhodamme (Pierce) labeled ES (Rh-ES, 20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection), without NT; (2) NT plus ES group, combined treatment with NT (6mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) and Rh-ES (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection). Four hours later, mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were resected, the imaging and quantitive analysis of fluorescent-labded-ES uptake in tumor was performed with bioluminescen.ee imaging system (Tsinghua University). The results showed that NT significantly increased the uptake and distribution of ES in tumor tissue by 4 folds (Figure 4Ε). Example 5: NT significantly enhances- the endocytosis of EGFR monoclonal antibody (Cetuximab) by tumor cells and the uptake and distribution of EGFR monoclonal antibody in animal tumor tissues. EGFR-expressing Α549 cells at exponential growth were cultured to reach 90% confluence and then pre-treated with DMEM medium containing NT as follows. NT stock solution was added to the medium to a final concentration of 0 pg/mL, 25 pg/mL, or SO pg/rnL, and the culture was then incubated in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for 20 -min for NT pre-treatment. After pre-treatment, EGFR monoclonal antibody (Cetuximab, Merck) stock solution (5mg/ml) was added to the medium to a final concentration of Sgg/mL. The culture was then incubated in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C ‘for 30 min to allow the internalization of EGFR monoclonal antibody by the endothelial cells, After treatment, the medium was removed, and the- endothelial cells were washed with ice-cold PBS for 3 times and then collected. The EGFR monoclonal antibody internalization in cells was examined by Western Blotting, compared with EGFR monoclonal antibody internalization in cells without NT treatment. The results showed that under the same Cetuximab dosage and treatment time, NT treatment significantly increased the Cetuximab internalization in the cells, and Cetuximab internalization was positively - correlated to NT concentrations (Figure 5 A). Human lung adenocarcinoma Α549 tumor cells at exponential growth were subcutaneously inoculated into 6-8 week-old nude mice (Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd), The mice (η ≈ 4/group) were separated into two. groups. When the tumor volume reached about 500 mm3 the first group was treated with CyS.S-labelled. Cetuximab (CyS.S, GE), and the second group was treated with Cy5,5-labelled Cetuximab (same dose as the first group) plus NT. Cy5,5-Cetuximab uptake in tumors from the two groups of animals was examined with bioluminescence imaging system (Tsinghua University). The results demonstrated that NT can increase the uptake and distribution of Cetuximab .in tumor tissues, and thus is useful in enhancing medicine uptake, improving therapeutic efficacy and tumor imaging (Figure 5Β). 1.
