Preparation of compound 39-f.
Compound 39-g (1.8 g, 7.28 mmol), benzyl bromide (4.4 g, 25.5 mmol) and potassium carbonate (3.52 g, 25.5 mmol) were dissolved in acetonitrile (50 mL). The reaction mixture was replacedwith nitrogen three times to remove the oxygen inside the system and then heated at 80°C for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with water (50 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL × 3). The combined organic phases were washed successively with water (50 mL × 3) and brine (50 mL),dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 10: 1) to delivera pale yellow solid 39-f (2 g, yield: 64%).
