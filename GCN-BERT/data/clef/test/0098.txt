[Step 4] Synthesis of N-(3-fluorophenyl)-N-((5-(hydrazinecarbonyl)pyridin-2-yl)methyl)-1-methylpiperidine-4-carboxamide
Methyl 6-((N-(3-fluorophenyl)-1-methylpiperidine-4-carboxamido)methyl)nicotinate (0.130 g, 0.337 mmol), synthesized in step 3, and hydrazine monohydrate (0.082 mL, 1.686 mmol) were dissolved in ethanol (10 mL) at room temperature, and the solution was heated under reflux for 12 hours, and then cooled to room temperature to terminate the reaction. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent, and the concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 4 g cartridge; methanol/dichloromethane = from 5% to 30%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.120 g, 92.3%) as a foam solid.
