Step B: 2-Chloro-3-(difluoromethyl)pyridine. To a solution of 2-chloropyridine-3-carbaldehyde (250 mg, 1.77 mmol) in dichloromethane (2.5 mL) was added diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST, 350 μL, 2.65 mmol) over 30 min at 0° C. The reaction mixture was warmed to r and stirred for 2 h. The reaction was quenched with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (4 mL) and the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (3×10 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (1×5 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated. Purification (FCC, SiO2, eluting with n-hexane:ethyl acetate (4:1)) afforded the title compound (100 mg, 0.611 mmol, 34%) as a yellow liquid.
