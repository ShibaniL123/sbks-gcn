1-Methyl-3-(3-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)propyl)pyrido [3,4-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione
Step 1
3 -(Methylamino)isonicotinic acid
3-Fluoroisonicotinic acid (3.00 g, 21.3 mmol) was dissolved in dioxane (6 mL) and 30% aqueous methylamine solution (22.0 g, 213 mmol) was added. The reaction solution was heated to 140Â°C and stirred for 14 hours. Conc. hydrochloric acid (12 N, 3 mL) was added and the pH was adjusted to 3, filtered and the filter cake was dried to give 3-(methylamino)isonicotinic acid (3.00 g, as a yellow solid) with a yield of 93%.
