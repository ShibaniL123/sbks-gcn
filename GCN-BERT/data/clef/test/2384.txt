Method D (Chlorination at C-6 after Cyclization)
Example 9: 6-chloro-8-[(1R,2R)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]-2-{[1-(methylsulfonyl)-piperidin-4-yl]amino}pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one
A solution of 8-[(1R,2R)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]-2-{[1-(methylsulfonyl)-piperidin-4-yl]amino}pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one (Example 2, 4.22 g, 10 mmol) and NCS (1.53 g, 11 mmol) in 2-MeTHF (100 mL) was stirred in a 50° C. oil bath for 44 h. After cooling to room temperature, EtOH (1.75 mL, 30 mmol) was added and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The solution was diluted with EtOAc (120 mL) and washed with a mixture of water (15 mL) and sat. aq NaHCO3 (15 mL). The aqueous layer was further extracted with EtOAc (80 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with sat. aq NaCl (15 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to dryness. Ethanol (45 mL) was added to the residue, and the resulting suspension stirred in a 55° C. oil bath for 1 h, then allowed to gradually cool with stirring to room temperature overnight. The resulting white solid was collected by filtration, rinsed with EtOH (3 mL), and dried under vacuum (˜10 mmHg, 50° C.) to give 6-chloro-8-[(1R,2R)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]-2-{[1-(methylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl]amino}pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one (Example 9, 3.86 g, 84%) as a white solid.
