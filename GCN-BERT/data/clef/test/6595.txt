CROSS REFERENCE APPLICATIONS This application is a Divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/967,473 filed Aug. 15, 2013, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel processes and intermediates for the preparations of isomer free Prostaglandins and the derivatives thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Prostaglandin ester analogues of the following Formula I-2 wherein is a single or double bond; R2 is a single bond or a C1-4-alkylene or —CH2O—; and R3 is a C1-7-alkyl or an aryl or an aralkyl, each of which is unsubstituted or substituted by a C1-4-alkyl, a halogen or a trihalomethyl; and R4 is C1-7-alkyl, such as, Latanoprost, Isoproyl unoprostone, Isoproyl cloprostenol, Travoprost and Tafluprost have been used in the management of open-angle glaucoma. The Prostaglandin ester analogues of Formula I-2 have been shown to have significantly greater hypotensive potency than the parent compound, presumably as a result of their more effective penetration through the cornea. They reduce intra-ocular pressure by enhancing uveoscleral outflow, and may also have some effect on trabecular meshwork as well. As shown in the following Scheme A: most of the Prostaglandin ester analogues of Formula I-2 disclosed in the prior art, such as in WO02096898, EP1886992, EP2143712, JP2012246301, U.S. Pat. No. 6,720,438, US2008033176, WO2010097672, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,582,779 were obtained by first synthesizing a Lactone VIII, wherein or is a protective group of carbonyl group; P1 and P2 are protective groups for the hydroxyl groups; is a single or double bond; R2 is a single bond or a C1-4-alkylene or —CH2O—; and R3 is a C1-7-alkyl or an aryl or an aralkyl, each of which is unsubstituted or substituted by a C1-4-alkyl, a halogen or a trihalomethyl and then conducting a semi-reduction of the Lactone to get a Lactol VII which was underwent a Wittig reaction to produce a C5˜C6 configuration cis-olefin of Formula IV-1, which was then converted to Prostaglandin ester analogues of Formula I-2. No matter which kind of Wittig reagents or solvents were used or what was the temperature for the Wittig reaction, it was inevitable that about 2˜10% 5,6-trans isomer of the compound of Formula IV-1 would be produced. If the starting material already contained a trace amount of an isomer (e.g., 15β-isomer or enantiomer), the resultant compound of Formula IV-1 would contain the corresponding isomer. As shown in the following Scheme B: some of the syntheses of Prostaglandin ester analogues of Formula I-2, for example, latanoprost disclosed in the prior art, such as WO02090324 and US2009259058, were involved a conjugate addition of a cyclopentenone VI′ with a ω-side chain unit IX′ to obtain a cyclopentanone V-2′, which was then underwent a 9-keto reduction to get a protected latanoprost IV-2′. Nevertheless, such a conjugate addition could not avoid the generation of a trace amount of 8β-isomer and 12α-isomer, nor could it avoid the generation of a trace amount of 9β-isomer. In addition, commercially available cyclopentenone VI′ and ω-side chain unit IX′ very likely contain trace amount of enantiomers and as a result, in the reaction of Scheme B, the 15β-isomer of latanoprost would be produced. Moreover, commercially available cyclopentenone VI′ could contain a trace amount of 5,6-trans isomer and as a result, in the reaction of Scheme B, the 5,6-trans isomer of the latanoprost would be produced. As shown in the following Scheme C: WO2011008756 discloses the synthesis of Travoprost by a ring-closing reaction with the cyclopentane ring at the presence of a Grubb's catalyst, and conducting deprotection and ring-opening reactions to obtain Travoprost. Although WO02011008756 mentions that the ring-closing reaction would obtain an olefin with a configuration of“cis” at C5˜C6, upon a study made by the inventor, the ring-closing reaction of WO2011008756 is still involved the generation of a certain amount of 5,6-trans isomer. Latanoprost, Isoproyl unoprostone, Travoprost and Tafluprost all are not solids, and their free acid forms are not solids, either. Even in all the processes shown in Schemes A to C, none of the intermediates with the necessary chiro centers and olefins being established could be crystallized. Consequently, it is unlikely to purify these Prostaglandin analogues or intermediates by crystallization to remove the isomers. Therefore, it was almost impossible to obtain any isomer free Prostaglandin ester analogues of Formula I-2 in an oil form through common purification technology. While WO02096898 and WO2011005505 disclose methods for removing the 5,6-trans isomer and 15-isomer of latanoprost by preparative HPLC and WO201109599 discloses removing the isomer of latanoprost acid by reverse phase preparative HPLC, these purification methods by utilization preparative HPLC to remove the isomer are costly and not suitable for mass productions. Given the above, commercially available Prostaglandin ester analogues of Formula I-2, either as active pharmaceutical ingredients or in the form of formulation products contain a certain amount of isomers, particularly 5,6-trans isomer. For medicine safety and reducing production cost, the present invention provides a simpler process for producing isomer free Prostaglandin ester analogues of Formula I-2 where unwanted isomers, particularly 5,6-trans isomers can be effectively and easily removed during the processes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, the present invention provides novel processes for the preparation of a compound of Formula I-2 substantially free of the 5,6-trans isomer: wherein is a single or double bond; R2 is a single bond or a C1-4-alkylene or —CH2O—; and R3 is a C1-7-alkyl or an aryl or an aralkyl, each of which is unsubstituted or substituted by a C1-4-alkyl, a halogen or a trihalomethyl; and R4 is C1-7-alkyl. In another aspect, the present invention provides novel processes for the preparation of a compound of Formula IV substantially free of the 5,6-trans isomer: wherein or a protective group of the carbonyl group; P1 is a protective group for the hydroxyl group; is a single or double bond; X is OH, OR4, NHR5 or NR4R5 where R4 is C1-7-alkyl and R5 is H or C1-7-alkyl; R2 is a single bond or a C1-4-alkylene or —CH2O—; and R3 is a C1-7-alkyl or an aryl or an aralkyl, each of which is unsubstituted or substituted by a C1-4-alkyl. In another aspect, the present invention provides novel processes for the preparation of a compound of Formula III substantially free of the 5,6-trans isomer: wherein or a protective group of the carbonyl group; P1 is a protective group for the hydroxyl group; is a single or double bond; R2 is a single bond or a C1-4-alkylene or —CH2O—; and R3 is a C1-7-alkyl or an aryl or an aralkyl, each of which is unsubstituted or substituted by a C1-4-alkyl, a halogen or a trihalomethyl. In one another aspect, the present invention provides novel processes for the preparation of high purity prostaglandin or prostaglandin analogues. In yet one another aspect, the present invention provides novel isomer free intermediates useful for the production of high purity prostaglandin or prostaglandin analogues and novel isomer free prostaglandin analogues. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Preparation of Compounds of Formula IV-1 The compound of Formula IV-1 wherein or a protective group for carbonyl group; P1 and P2 are protective groups for hydroxyl groups; is a single or double bond; R2 is a single bond or a C1-4-alkylene or —CH2O—; and R3 is a C1-7-alkyl or an aryl or an aralkyl, each of which is unsubstituted or substituted by a C1-4-alkyl, a halogen or a trihalomethyl, can be prepared according to the reactions shown in Scheme 1: As shown in step (a) and step (b) of Scheme 1, the Lactone of Formula VIII, wherein or a protective group for carbonyl group; P1 and P2 are protective groups for hydroxyl groups; is a single or double bond; R2 is a single bond or a C1-4-alkylene or —CH2O—; and R3 is a C1-7-alkyl or an aryl or an aralkyl, each of which is unsubstituted or substituted by a C1-4-alkyl, a halogen or a trihalomethyl, is subjected to a semi-reductive reaction with a suitable reducing agent, such as diisobutyl aluminium hydride (DIBAL), followed by a Wittig reaction to produce a compound of Formula IV-1. Owing to the use of different solvents, reagents, temperatures, and the like, the resultant cis-selectivity on the C5-C6 double bond of the compound of Formula IV-1 would depend on the solvents, reagents, temperatures, and/or the other reaction conditions involved in the Wittig reaction. Nevertheless, no matter what the reaction conditions were, it was inevitable that about 2-10% 5,6-trans isomer would be produced and such isomer was the main by-product of the preparation according to Scheme 1 for the compound of Formula IV-1. Moreover, the Lactone of Formula VIII wherein may contain a trace amount of 15β-isomer, and as a result, the 15β-isomer of the compound of Formula IV-1 prepared according to Scheme 1 would be produced. Most of the lactones of Formula VIII were produced from the popular, commercially available Corey lactones. Commercially available Corey lactones contain a trace amount of an enantiomer, and the lactones of Formula VIII prepared from such Corey lactones may contain a trace amount of an enantiomer. Consequently, when a compound of Formula IV-1 was produced according to Scheme 1, an accompanying enantiomer of the compound of Formula IV-1 would also be produced. In Scheme 1, suitable protective group for hydroxyl groups, i.e., for P1 and P2, include, but are not limited to, methoxymethyl, methoxythiomethyl, tert-butylthiomethyl, benzyloxymethyl, 2-methoxyethoxymethyl, bis(2-chloroethoxy)methyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl, 4-methoxytetrahydropyranyl, 4-methoxytetrahydrothiopyranyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydrothiofuranyl, 1-ethoxyethyl, 1-methyl-1-methoxyethyl, triphenylmethyl, allyl, benzyl and substituted benzyl. Preferably, the protective group is methoxymethyl, methoxythiomethyl, tert-butylthiomethyl, benzyloxymethyl, 2-methoxyethoxymethyl, bis(2-chloroethoxy)methyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl, 4-methoxytetrahydropyranyl, 4-methoxytetrahydrothiopyranyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydrothiofuranyl, I-ethoxyethyl, 1-methyl-1-methoxyethyl, or triphenylmethyl. In Scheme 1, the suitable protective groups for carbonyl groups include, but are not limited to, dialkyl ketal, diaralkyl ketal, diacetyl ketal, dithio ketal, 1,3-dioxane, 1,3-dioxolane, 1,3-dithiane, 1,3-dithiolane, and 1,3-oxathiolane. Preferred protective groups for carbonyl groups include dialkyl ketal, 1,3-dioxane, and 1,3-dioxolane. As an alternative, the compound of Formula IV-1 can be prepared according to the reactions shown in Scheme 2: As shown in step (a) of Scheme 2, the compounds of Formula V-2, wherein or a protective group for carbonyl group; P1 and P2 are protective groups for hydroxyl groups; is a single or double bond; R2 is a single bond or a C1-4-alkylene or —CH2O—; and R3 is a C1-7-alkyl or an aryl or an aralkyl; and R is C1-7-alkyl, each of which is unsubstituted or substituted by a C1-4-alkyl, a halogen or a trihalomethyl, are prepared by a coupling reaction, which is preferably performed at a temperature ranging from −100° C. to 40° C., with an enantiomerically enriched ω-side chain unit of a cuprate derived from the compound of Formula IX-1, Formula IX-2 or Formula IX-3 wherein or a protective group for carbonyl group; P2 is a protective group for hydroxyl group; Y is halogen; is a single or double bond; R2 is a single bond or a C1-4-alkylene or —CH2O—; and R3 is a C1-7-alkyl or an aryl or an aralkyl, each of which is unsubstituted or substituted by a C1-4-alkyl, a halogen or a trihalomethyl; R7 is C1-7-alkyl, of an optically active cyclopentenone of Formula VI wherein R6 is C1-7-alkyl; and P1 is a protective group for hydroxyl group. Step (b) of Scheme 2 pertains to a keto reduction which was performed with a reducing agent selected from sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride, diisobutylaluminum hydride, lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminohydride, a lithium tri-alkyl borohydride, a potassium tri-alkyl borohydride or a sodium tri-alkyl borohydride or a mixture thereof. Preferably, the reducing agent is lithium tri-sec-butylborohydride (L-selectride), lithium tri-amylborohydride, sodium tri-sec-butylborohydride, potassium tri-sec-butylborohydride, or potassium tri-amylborohydride or a mixture thereof. More preferably, the reducing agent is lithium tri-sec-butylborohydride. Step (c) of Scheme 2 pertains to an enzymatic hydrolysis reaction which was conducted in the presence of an enzyme, preferably a Candida antarctica lipase, such as Lipase 435, in an aqueous phase (water or a buffer), and/or an organic solvent such as hexane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, or methylisobutylketone, or a mixture thereof. Step (d) of Scheme 2 pertains to an enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis reaction, preferably a chemical hydrolysis reaction. For example, a compound of Formula IV-3 was dissolved in an alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol, and reacted with a base, such as potassium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide to produce a compound of Formula IV-1. The compounds of Formula IV-1 produced according to Scheme 2 would be accompanied not only with the by-products (8-isomer and 12-isomer) of the conjugate addition reaction of step (a), but the by-product (9-isomer) of the 9-keto reduction reaction of step (b), and even the resultant isomers (5,6-trans isomer and 15β-isomer) produced from the impurities in the starting material. In Scheme 2, suitable protective groups for hydroxyl groups (i.e., P1 and P2) include, but are not limited to, methoxymethyl, methoxythiomethyl, 2-methoxyethoxymethyl, bis(2-chloroethoxy)methyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl, 4-methoxytetrahydropyranyl, 4-methoxytetrahydrothiopyranyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydrothiofuranyl, 1-ethoxyethyl, 1-methyl-1-methoxyethyl, triphenylmethyl, allyl, benzyl, substituted benzyl and SiRaRbRc wherein Ra, Rb and Rc are each independently a C1-8 alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, a substituted phenyl, or a substituted benzyl. Preferably, the protective group is trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, n-octyldimethylsilyl, methoxymethyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, or tetrahydropyranyl. In Scheme 2, suitable protective groups for carbonyl group include, but are not limited to, dialkyl ketal, diaralkyl ketal, diacetyl ketal, dithio ketal, 1,3-dioxane, 1,3-dioxolane, 1,3-dithiane, 1,3-dithiolane, and 1,3-oxathiolane. Preferred protective groups for carbonyl groups include dialkyl ketal, 1,3-dioxane, and 1,3-dioxolane. Synthesis of Prostaglandin Analogues of Formula I-2 Substantially Free of the 5,6-trans isomer When used herein, the term “substantially free of the 5,6-trans isomer” or “substantially isomers free” means that a compound in question does not contain more than 0.5% of 5,6-trans isomer or does not contain more than 0.5% of 5,6-trans isomer and, if present, the 15β-isomer. According to the present invention, a novel approach for the synthesis of a prostaglandin analogue of Formula I-2 substantially free of the 5,6-trans isomer: wherein is a single or double bond; R2 is a single bond or a C1-4-alkylene or —CH2O—; R3 is a C1-7-alkyl or an aryl or an aralkyl, each of which is unsubstituted or substituted by a C1-4-alkyl, a halogen or a trihalomethyl; and R4 is C1-7-alkyl, is depicted in Scheme 3. As shown in Step (a) of Scheme 3, a compound of Formula III wherein or a protective group for carbonyl group; P1 and P2 are protective groups for hydroxyl groups; and , R2 and R3 are as defined above for Formula I-2, is prepared by the macrolactonization of a compound of Formula IV-1 wherein or a protective group for carbonyl group; P1 and P2 are protective groups for hydroxyl groups; and , R2 and R3 are as defined above, which contains 0˜5% 5,6-trans isomer or/and other isomers, and can be prepared from the method of Scheme 1 or Scheme 2. The macrolactonization may involve the activation of the carboxyl or/and hydroxyl functional groups. In this route, the macrolactonization comprises the initial formation of a thioester with a suitable reagent, which includes, but is not limited to, S-pyridin-2-yl chloromethanethioate, 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide/triphenylphosphine, or 4-tert-butyl-2-(2-(4-tert-butyl-1-isopropyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)disulfanyl)-1-isopropyl-1H-imidazole/triphenylphosphine. Optionally, a catalytic amount of an amine, such as triethylamine, can be added to the reaction, and in addition, a metal ion, such as Ag+, Hg2+, or Cu2+, can also be added to promote the cyclization rate. Suitable sources for providing the metal ion include AgClO4, AgBF4, AgOTf, CuBr2, CuCl2, and (CF3CO2)2Hg. The macrolactonization may alternatively involve the initial formation of a mixed anhydride with a suitable reagent in the presence or absence of a base or a Lewis acid. Suitable reagents for forming the mixed anhydrides include, but are not limited to, 2,4,6-trichlorobenzoyl chloride, 2-nitro-6-nitrobenzoic anhydride, p-nitrofluoromethylbenzoic anhydride, p-nitrobenzoic anhydride and the like. Examples of the suitable bases include 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, pyrolidinopyridine, triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, and isopropyldiethylamine. Examples of suitable Lewis acids include Sc(OTf)3, TiCl4, AgClO4, trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) and TiCl2(OTf). The macrolactonization can also be achieved by using a condensation reagent and a base in an appropriate solvent. Suitable condensation reagents include, but are not limited to, N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 2-chloro-1-methyl-pyridium iodide, 2-chloro-4,5-dihydro-1,3-dimethyl-1H-imidazolium chloride, N,N-diphenylchlorophenylmethyleniminium chloride, cyanuric chloride, 1,3-dimethyl-2-chloroimidazolium chloride and N,N,N,N-tetramethylchloroformamidinium chloride, and the like. Examples of suitable bases include pyridine, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), and the like. Suitable solvents for the condensation reaction include methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, and 1,2-dichloroethane, and a mixture thereof. Upon analyzing a resultant compound of Formula III by HPLC or UPLC, it is unexpectedly found that the resultant compound of Formula III is substantially free of the 5,6-trans isomer, which reveals that the macrolactonization reaction exhibits a high cis-selectivity, that is, the 5,6-cis compounds of Formula IV-1 dominate in the macrolactonization reaction whereas the 5,6-trans compounds of Formula IV-1 hardly undergo the macrolactonization reaction. Step (b) of Scheme 3 involves a deprotection reaction by removing the P1 or/and the P2 at the ω-side chain. The conditions for carrying out such deprotection reactions are obvious to persons skilled in the art. For example, the macrolactone of Formula III when P1 and, if present, P2 are tetrahydropyranyl protective groups is dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as methanol or a solvent mixture of acetone and water in a volumetric ratio of 5 to 1, treated with a deprotecting agent such as hydrogen chloride, p-toluenesulfonic acid, or pyridium p-toluenesulfonate, and stirred at room temperature for 10 minutes to 10 hours. The reaction is quenched with a base, e.g., ammonium hydroxide or the like, and subjected to a work-up procedure conducted in a conventional manner. It is unexpectedly found that the resultant deprotected compound of formula II substantially free of the 5,6-trans isomer exhibits excellent crystallizability, for example, as evidenced from the working examples provided thereinafter as having a melting point higher than 100° C., compared to Compounds IIa, IIb, and IIe disclosed in WO2011008756 (Example 9, 12a-12c) each of which contains a certain amount of a5,6-trans isomer and is not in a solid form. The crude product of the compound of Formula II contains a small amount of isomers (such as 15β-isomer, an enantiomer) derived from the impurity in the starting compound of Formula IV-1, and such isomer can be further removed by purifying the crude product via crystallization. Step (c) in combination with Step (e), and alternatively Step (d) of Scheme 3 involve transesterification reactions of the macrolactone of Formula II to form a prostaglandin analogue of Formula I-2. In Step (d), the transesterification includes the direct reaction of a compound of Formula II with a nucleophile selected from the group consisting of a C1-7 alkanol, a C1-7 alkoxide, a C1-7 alkoxide salt, or a mixture thereof to form a prostaglandin analogue of Formula I-2 containing a hydroxyl group and an ester group. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the nucleophile is selected from 2-propanol, sodium 2-propoxide, or a mixture thereof. In Step (c) and Step (e), the transesterification includes hydrolyzing the macrolactone of Formula II to form a compound of Formula I-1 containing a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group, and then esterificating the compound of Formula I-1 to obtain a prostaglandin analogue of Formula I-2. According to the present invention, the resultant compound of Formula I-2 can be further purified by silylating all the hydroxyl groups in the compound of Formula I-2 with a silylating agent of formula XSiRaRbRc wherein X is a halogen, such as F, Cl, or Br, Ra, Rb and Rc are each independently a C1-8 alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, a substituted phenyl, or a substituted benzyl, in a suitable solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide (DMF), or ethyl acetate, and in the presence of a base such as imidazole or triethylamine to form a compound of Formula I-2″, wherein Ra, Rb and Rc are each independently a C1-8 alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, a substituted phenyl, or a substituted benzyl; and , R2 and R3 are as defined above; removing the impurities; and then desilylating the resultant compound to form a compound of Formula I-2 having an improved purity. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the silylating agent suitable for the purification reaction is selected from the group consisting of chlorotrimethylsilane, chlorotriethylsilane, chlorodimethyl(octyl)silane, and tert-butylchlorodimethylsilane. As for the conditions for carrying out the desilylation reaction, they can be those obvious to persons skilled in the art for the deprotection reaction described hereinbefore. According to some preferred embodiments of the present invention, certain conventionally known prostaglandin analogues substantially free of isomers can be prepared in the following manners: Synthesis of Isomers Free Travoprost As shown in the following Scheme, isomers free Travoprost can be easily produced from commercially available compound Xa, without the need of utilizing chromatography for separating the isomers. The reaction in step (a) of Scheme 4 is a protection reaction. Examples of suitable protective groups are described by T. W. Greene in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis,” John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1981. Preferred protective groups are base stable, and may include, but are not limited to, methoxymethyl, methoxythiomethyl, 2-methoxyethoxymethyl, bis(2-chloroethoxy)methyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl, 4-methoxytetrahydropyranyl, 4-methoxytetrahydrothiopyranyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydrothiofuranyl, 1-ethoxyethyl, 1-methyl-1-methoxyethyl, triphenylmethyl, allyl, and benzyl and substituted benzyl. The reaction conditions for conducting the protection can be those conventionally known in the art. For example, the Lactone of Formula Xa is dissolved in methylene chloride and p-toluenesulfonic acid in a catalytic amount is added thereto. The reaction mixture is subjected to an ice bath, and an appropriate amount of 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran is added, and then is stirred at room temperature for about 10 minutes to about 10 hours to obtain a protected Lactone of Formula Villa. In Step (b) of Scheme 4, the Lactone of Formula VIIIa is subjected to a semi-reductive reaction with diisobutyl aluminium hydride (DIBAL) to obtain the Lactol of Formula VIIa. The reaction can be conducted at a temperature ranging from −60° C. to −100° C., preferably from −60° C. to −80° C. In Step (c) of Scheme 4, the Lactol of Formula VIIa is then subjected to a Wittig reaction with the ylide generated from (4-carboxybutyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide and potassium tert-butoxide, to produce a compound of Formula IV-1a containing 2˜4% 5,6-trans isomer. Step (d) of Scheme 4 is a macrolactonization reaction. No matter whether the macrolactonization undergoes through the formation of a thioester or a mixed anhydride or condensation with 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, the compound of IIIa can be obtained. Upon analysis of a resultant compound of Formula IIIa by UPLC, it is found that no matter what reagents and reaction conditions were used, all the obtained compounds of Formula IIIa contain the 5,6-trans isomer in an amount less than 0.03% or even less than the amount that can be detected by UPLC. Step (e) of Scheme 4 is a deprotection reaction. The macrolactone of Formula IIIa wherein each of P1 and P2 is a tetrahydropyranyl protective group is dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as methanol, treated with a deprotecting agent such as hydrogen chloride, p-toluenesulfonic acid, or pyridium p-toluenesulfonate, and stirred at room temperature for 10 minutes to 10 hours. The reaction is quenched with a base, e.g., aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution or the like, and subjected to a work-up procedure conducted in a conventional manner to obtain the compound of Formula IIa as a solid. After crystallization, the resultant crystalline compound and the filtrate of the crystallization were analyzed by UPLC. It was found that either the isomers or the impurities resulting from the reactions could be effectively removed by the crystallization process. The compound of Formula IIa substantially free of isomers and impurities was subjected to hydrolysis reaction in step (f) of Scheme 4 to obtain isomers free Travoprost acid ((+)-fluprostenol), which was then subjected to an esterification reaction in step (g) of Scheme 4 to obtain isomers free Travoprost. Synthesis of Isomers Free Latanoprost As shown in Scheme 5, isomers free latanoprost can be produced from commercially available compound Xb in the same manner as shown in Scheme 4. The product of Formula IIb obtained in step (e) also exhibits excellent crystallinity. Analysis of the crude compound of Formula IIb before crystallization revealed that the amount of 5,6-trans isomer was already less than 0.1%, which showed that the 5,6-trans isomer side-product of the Wittig reaction was removed during the macrolactonization process. Similarly, during the crystallization of the compound of Formula IIb, the trace amount of the 5,6-trans isomer and if any, the 15β-isomer derived from the starting compound Xb, and even the impurities generated from the preceding reactions could be easily removed. Consequently, highly pure, isomers free Latanoprost could be easily obtained. Synthesis of Pure Tafluprost As shown in Scheme 6, similar to the reactions shown in Schemes 4 and 5, step(a) is a DIBAL reduction reaction, step(b) is a Wittig reaction, step(c) is a microlactonization reaction, and step(d) is a deprotection reaction. The compound of Formula IIc obtained in step (d) is substantially free of the 5,6-trans isomer. It was subjected to the hydrolysis reaction of step (f) and the esterification reaction of step (i) to obtain Tafluprost substantially free of the 5,6-trans isomer. As an alternative, the compound of Formula IIc could be acylated with an acylating agent of Formula R8COCl or (R8CO)2O wherein R8 is C1-7-alkyl, unsubstituted phenyl or substituted phenyl such as acetyl chloride, acetic anhydride, benzoyl chloride, benzoic anhydride, or 4-phenyl benzoyl chloride, into the compound of Formula IIc′ wherein R8 is C1-7-alkyl, unsubstituted phenyl or substituted phenyl which has better crystallinity and the compound of Formula IIc′ could be purified by crystallization so as to remove the trace amount of the isomer, and if present, even the enantiomer to obtain isomer free Tafluprost. Step (g) is a hydrolysis reaction which simultaneously opens the macrolactone ring and deacylates the compound to form isomer free Tafluprost acid. In Step (h), the transesterification includes the direct reaction of a compound of Formula IIc with a nucleophile selected from 2-propanol, sodium 2-propoxide, or a mixture thereof to form Tafluprost. Synthesis of Pure Isopropyl Unoprostone As shown in Scheme 7, similarly, step(a) is a DIBAL reduction reaction, step(b) is a Wittig reaction, step(c) is a microlactonization reaction, step(e) is a deprotection reaction, step (f) is a hydrolysis reaction, and step (g) is an esterification reaction. For the synthesis of Isopropyl Unoprostone, the starting compound of Formula VIIId, wherein P1 and P2 are protective groups for the hydroxyl groups, was subjected to step(a)˜step(c) to form the macrolactone of Formula IIId. Thereafter, the macrolactone of Formula IIId was preferably subjected to step (d) for selectively removing P2 and oxidizing the resultant hydroxy group into a keto group. For example, the macrolactone of Formula IIId, wherein P1 is tetrahydropyranyl; and P2 is tert-butyldimethylsilyl, was reacted in a suitable solvent, such as THF, with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF), so as to selectively remove tert-butyldimethylsilyl; and then oxidized at proper oxidation conditions, such as Collins oxidation, Swern oxidation, PCC oxidation, PDC oxidation, or TEMPO oxidation, preferably TEMPO oxidation, to form a compound of Formula IIId′ substantially free of the 5,6-trans isomer. The compound of Formula IIId′ was then subjected to the deprotection reaction in step(e) to remove P1 so as to form the novel crystalline compound of Formula IId′, followed by the ring-opening hydrolysis reaction in step (f) to obtain isomer free Unoprostone, which was further subjected to the esterification reaction of step (g) to obtain isomer free isopropyl Unoprostone. As mentioned above, the macrolactone of Formula IIId could be subjected to step (d) for removing the protection group for carbonyl to form a compound of Formula IIId′.

The macrolactone of Formula III is reacted with an alkyl amine of Formula HNR4R5 where R4 is C1-7-alkyl and R5 is H or C1-7-alkyl, such as, but not limited to, ethylamine, in an aprotic solvent, such as, but not limited to, tetrahydrofuran, to form a compound of Formula IV-2, wherein X is NR4R5, substantially free of the 5,6-trans isomer.
