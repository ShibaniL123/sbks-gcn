Step 3
N-(1-(5-bromobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine
1-(5-bromobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-amine 76c (1.2 g, 4.722 mmol), 2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate 1b (1.59 g, 7.083 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylehtylamine (1.83 g, 14.166 mmol) were dissolved in 25 mL of 1,4-dioxane. The mixture was warmed up to 90Â°C and stirred for 12 hours, then the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound N-(1-(5-bromobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine 76d (1.3 g, yield 84%) as a yellow oil.
