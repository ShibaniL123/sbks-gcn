Intermediate 44: 8-Iodo-7-methoxy-2-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine
To a microwave vial charged with EtOH (1.0 mL) were added 3-iodo-4-methoxypyridin-2-amine (100 mg, 0.4 mmol) and 3-bromo-1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-one (83 μL, 2.7 mmol). The vial was capped and the reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 2 h, then heated at 50° C. for 18 h, and then at 100° C. for 3.5 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to rt and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was diluted with sat. aq. NaHCO3 and extracted with DCM (×3). The combined organic extracts were concentrated. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-40% EtOAc/hexanes) provided the title compound as an off-white solid (81 mg, 59% yield).
