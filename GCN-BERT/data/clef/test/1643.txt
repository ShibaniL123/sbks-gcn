(4) Preparation of 2-(2,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-8,11-dioxa-2-azadispiro[3.3.47.24]tridecane
(1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]decane-8,8-diyl)dimethanol (8 g, 39.56 mmol) was dissolved in acetonitrile (160 mL), to which was added N,N-diisopropylamine (15.3 g, 118.38 mmol), and trifluoromethylsulfonic anhydride (24.6 g, 87.19 mmol) was added dropwise at -30°C, then reacted at -30°C for 30 min, N,N-diisopropylamine (15.3 g, 118.38 mmol) and (2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)methylamine (7.9 g, 47.25 mmol) was added, and the system was heated to 80°C and reacted for 1.5h. Ethyl acetate (200 mL) was added for dilution, water (300 mL×3) was used for washing, anhydrous sodium sulfate was used for drying. After concentration, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane : methanol =1:50-1:10) to obtain the title compound as a white solid (4 g, yield 30%).
