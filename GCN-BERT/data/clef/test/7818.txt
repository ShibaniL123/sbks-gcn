FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention belongs to the field of "one pot" methods for catalytic conversion of cellulose into alkyl-α,β-glycosides. STATE OF THE ART PRIOR TO THE INVENTION The current growing demand for reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere because of its effect on global warming, has generated a rapid development of alternative technologies that use renewable raw materials among which is cellulose. The fact that cellulose is abundant and is a renewable source, has led to a boom in studies related to the transformation of the same. On the other hand, the long-chain alkyl glycosides are non-ionic compounds that have excellent properties as surfactants, as well as having a low toxicity and being biodegradable. These carbohydrates derivatives can be used in cosmetics and detergents, as emulsifiers in the food industry and as dispersing agents in pharmaceutics. There are two main methods for obtaining this type of compounds, the Fischer glycosidation process and the Koenig-Knorr method. The Fisher glycosidation process is simpler and less expensive than the Koenig-Knorr method and involves an acetylation of a carbohydrate (usually glucose) using an acid catalyst and in the presence of an alcohol. Various acid catalysts, both homogeneous and heterogeneous, are described in the literature that have been used, such as, e.g. ionic exchange resins, amorphous silica-alumina, zeolite and mesoporous materials of the MCM-41 type, mineral catalysts and organic acids among others. Acid hydrolysis of the cellulose is an important source for obtaining glucose. Cellulose, which as mentioned above is an increasingly important source for obtaining biofuels and chemical compounds, is a crystalline polymer of D-glucopyranose units joined together through β-1,4-glycosidic bonds. The interaction between different chains is ensured through hydrogen bonds and Van der Valls interactions, which provides cellulose with a high stability, making it difficult to carry out the process of hydrolysis of the same. Most of the processes of hydrolysis to convert the cellulose into glucose are carried out in water. The reaction is carried out in the presence of acid minerals, enzymes or under hydrothermal conditions. Recently, processes using heterogeneous catalysts have been developed. S. Sugama et al, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2008 describes the use of carbon materials with SO3H groups. A. Takagaky et al, Chem. Comm. 2008, use laminated metal oxides such as, e.g. HNbMoO6, but the yield of glucose is too low in both cases. To promote the transformation of cellulose into glucose, Onda et al, Green Chemistry, 2008 and Top. Cat. 2009, use as starting material cellulose that has been pre-treated to reduce the crystallinity of the same. R.P. Swatloski, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2002, have described that it is possible to dissolve cellulose in ionic liquids, and also in the presence of mineral catalysts or acid solid catalysts cellulose can also be depolymerized. W. Deng et al, Chem. Comm. 2010 have described the transformation of cellulose into methyl-α,β-glycosides in methanol medium with a yield of 50%-60% in the presence of several acid catalysts, at 468 K and 30 bars. But this process requires high pressure and temperature, and affords alkyl-glucosides low yields when it reacts with long-chain alcohols needed to obtain products with surfactant properties such as those obtained by the method of the present invention. The present invention describes a method able to convert cellulose into alkyl-α,β-glycosides surfactants in mild conditions and in a reaction in a single reactor using an appropriate catalyst and suitable reaction conditions that allow to couple the hydrolysis of the starting cellulose with the Fisher glycosidation of the glucose formed in the first step with alcohols with chains with more than 4 carbons. Processes in a single reactor (also known as one pot reactions) are a strategy intended to intensify the processes to improve the efficiency of reactions that occur in series. These reactions are being widely studied because of their numerous advantages such as the elimination of the processes of separation and purification of intermediates with the subsequent increase in production and reduction of investment and waste formation. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for obtaining surfactants from cellulose and hemicellulose that is carried out in a reaction in a single reactor, one pot, and that comprises at least the following steps: a) a first step of hydrolysis where the cellulose is mixed with at least one ionic liquid, water and catalyst;b) a second step of glycosidation wherein at least one alcohol is added when the hydrolysis level of the cellulose is comprised between 10 and 80%. When cellulose is referred to in the description of the present invention, it refers both to cellulose and mixtures of hemicellulose and cellulose. According to this method, it is possible to transform cellulose directly into surfactants, e.g. alkyl-α,β-glycosides, preferably alkyl-α,β-glucosides and alkyl-α,β-xylosides in a one pot reaction, and for this, the appropriate catalyst and the appropriate reaction conditions that allow to couple the two reactions that have to be carried out in one pot have been found, the hydrolysis of the starting cellulose in ionic medium and the Fisher glycosidation of the glucose formed in the first step with alcohols. Preferably, the ionic liquid that is used in the first step can be preferably selected from ionic liquids that contain the imidazolium group as cation, and more preferably it is BMIMCI. In the method described according to the present invention, the amount of water present in the medium is important since, although it favours the first stage of hydrolysis of the cellulose and minimizes the formation of HMF (unwanted product), at the same time it has a negative effect on the second stage of glycosidation of glucose, so it is necessary to find an amount which is most conducive to the hydrolysis of the cellulose trying to cause the least possible negative effect on the Fisher glycosidation. As explained above, according to a particular embodiment of the present invention the cellulose/water ratio is between 20 and 0.2 by weight, more preferably between 10 and 0.5 by weight. Both for the hydrolysis of cellulose and the Fisher glycosidation of the method that is carried out according to the present invention is necessary that the catalyst is an acid catalyst. This catalyst can be preferably selected from heteropoly acids and catalysts comprising sulfonic groups. The heteropoly acids are preferred heteropoly acids containing PO4 or SiO4 tetrahedra. In addition, these heteropoly acids contain preferably Mo o W. According to a particular embodiment, the heteropoly acid is H3PW12O40. In the case where the catalyst comprises sulfonic groups, they must be accessible so as to increase the effectiveness of the catalyst. According to a particular embodiment, the catalyst used involves the use of resin with sulfonic groups, being an example of them Amberlyst 15Dry. Amberlyst 15Dry resin is a commercial catalyst from Rohm and Haas company. Once carried out the first step, in which the initial cellulose and the ionic liquid have been mixed together with the catalyst and a certain amount of water, the hydrolysis reaction starts that can be carried out at a preferred temperature between 60 and 140° C and at a preferred pressure between 1 and 5 bars and more preferably is carried out at atmospheric pressure for a period of time sufficient to hydrolyze, preferably between 10% of the cellulose, but no more than 80%. At this time, in the second step, an alcohol is added and the pressure of the system is reduced to a preferred range between 5 and 700 mbar and more preferably between 20 and 600 mbar, maintaining the preferred temperature between 60 and 140° C. In the second stage of the reaction, the hydrolysis of the cellulose can continue taking place at the same time that the second step glycosidation occurs. The reaction time varies depending on the reaction conditions and the amount of catalyst used. Under preferred reaction conditions, the ratio of cellulose or mixtures of cellulose and hemicellulose with respect to ionic liquid can vary between 0.4 and 0.02 by weight, the ratio of cellulose plus ionic liquid to catalyst being preferably between 80 and 5 by weight and preferably between 60 and 10 by weight. It should be noted that the single combination of results reported so far on hydrolysis of cellulose and glycosidation of glucose with alcohols is not enough for obtaining the results of the process that is described in the present invention. If one carries out the complete hydrolysis of the cellulose and then it is reacted with the alcohol, either at atmospheric pressure or under vacuum, the glycosidation product selectivity is low. If on the other hand the cellulose and the alcohol are mixed from the beginning, the final yield is low. In our case, we have found that surprisingly the results obtained are better when the alcohol is introduced when only a part of cellulose has been hydrolyzed, preferably between 10% and 80%. Moreover, it has been observed that the method is efficient if at that moment is carried out a variation of the working pressure in the above ranges. The alcohol introduced in step 2, is preferably an alcohol with 4 or more carbons, such as for example butanol and hexanol and more preferably is an alcohol with 8 or more carbons, such as for example, octanol, decanol dodecanol and tetradecanol, preferably octanol. Preferably, these alcohols can be linear alcohols. The products obtained according to the method of the present invention may be alkyl-α,β-glycosides, preferably alkyl-α,β-glycosides and alkyl-α,β-xylosides that can be used as surfactants due to their properties.
