CA 02544136 the 2006-04-20 present invention conceme the use of the agomélatine or N [2 (7-méthoxy-1naphtyl) éthyl] acetamide of formula (I) • (I) like its hydrates, crystalline forms and additive salts to an acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable base, only or in association for obtaining drugs intended for the treatment of the bipolar disorders, in particular of the bipolar disorders of types I and II, and more particularly of the bipolar disorders of type I. The agomélatine or N [2 (7-méthoxy-l-naphtyl) éthyl] acetamide has the double effect of being on the one hand a agonist on the receivers of the system melatoninergic and on the other hand antagonistic of the receiver 5-HT2 C. These properties confer to him an activity in the central nervous system and more particularly in the treatment of the major depression, the depressions saisounières, cardiovascular pathology, the pathology sleep disorders of the digestive system, insomnia and tirednesses due to the jet lags, of the disorders of the appetite and obesity. The agomélatine, its preparation and its use into therapeutic were described in European patents EP 0.447.285 and EP 1.564.202. The applicant discovered at present that the agomélatine or N [2 (7-méthoxy-1naphtyl) éthyl] acetamide, like her hydrates, forms crystalline and additive salts to an acid or at a base pharmaceutically acceptable, used only or in association, had interesting properties allowing to use it in the treatment of the bipolar disorders, in particular of the bipolar disorders of types I and II, and more particularly in the bipolar disorders of type I. CA 02544136 2006-04-20 the bipolar disorders are a state psychopathological having an impact of most severe on the life of the patients, as well on the social plan, family as professional. They are characterized by occurred generally repeated depressive episodes, maniacs, hypomanes or mixed separated by pé6odes during which the subjects are a priori unscathed of major psychic dysfunction. In other words, the patients suffering from bipolar disorders are marked by a vulnerability to present marked fluctuations of mood in a recurring way. The caractéfistiques ones of the access and their evolution in time makes it possible to distinguish several clinical forms: the bipolar disorder of type I is most typical and is characterized by one or more episodes maniacs or mixed usually accompanied by major depressive episodes; the bipolar disorder of type II as for him relates to the association of at least a major depressive episode and an episode of hypomanie, attenuated form of the mania. The risk of suicide of bipolar patients is very high: 25 to 50% of them made at least an suicide attempt. There currently does not exist of treatment satisfactory and recognized for the bipolar disorders. The treatments of first intention are generally the stabilizers of mood or thymorégulateurs, but these treatments are often unable to relieve the depressive symptoms (J. Covering joint. Psychiatry, 2004,65 (4); 569-579). The concomitant regulation of an antidepressant, although frequently used, is a very discussed practice because the latter can start or worsen the mixed states maniacs and states, and must be stopped at the time of occurred of episode maniac. The antidepressants are in particular famous to support induction or the acceleration of the cycles hyperthymic, to support two to three times plus occurred of a turn maniac or hypomaniaque, and finally their prolonged use seems to lead to an increase in the number of depressive episodes and maniacs. The applicant discovered at present that, in a surprising way, the agomélatine could be used in the treatment of the bipolar disorders, in particular of the bipolar disorders of types I and It, and more particularly in the bipolar disorders of type I, only or in association. CA 02544136 2009-08-03 the expected effects of the use of the agomélatine in the bipolar disorders and more particularly in the bipolar disorders of type I were, of the fact even of its activity in the depression, those of the antidepressants décñts in the literature like the paroxétine for example. In a surprising way, the agomélatine does not behave like a traditional antidepressant, as that could be observed during a clinical study undertaken near suffering patients of bipolar disorders of type I. These results make it possible to consider its even prolonged use, in the bipolar disorders, in particular the bipolar disorders of types I and II, and more particularly in the bipolar disorders of type I. The invention thus relates to the use of the agomélatine, like its hydrates, forms cfistallines and additive salts ì an acid or base pharmaeeutiquement acceptable, only or in association, for obtaining pharmaceutical compositions intended for the treatment of the bipolar disorders, in particular of the bipolar disorders of type I and II, and more particularly of the bipolar disorders of type I. An aspect of the invention aims at the use of the agomélatine, its hydrates, crystalline forms or additive salts to an acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable base, for obtaining a drug intended for the treatment of the bipolar disorders. Another aspect of the invention aims at the use of the agomélatine, its hydrates, crystalline forms or additive salts to an acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable base, for obtaining a drug intended for the treatment of the bipolar disorders of type I. Another aspect aims at an association containing of the agomélatine or one of its hydrates, crystalline forms or additive salts to an acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable base, and an agent thymoregulator. The invention also relates to association between the agomélatine and a stabihsator of mood or thymoregulator for obtaining pharmaceutical compositions intended for the treatment of the bipolar disorders, in particular of the bipolar disorders of types I and It, and more particularly of the bipolar disorders of type I. CA 02544136 2009-08-03 -3aLes stabilizing of mood or thymoregulator according to the invention relates to lithium, the antiépileptiques ones, such as for example the carbamazépine, the valproate and the lamotrigine ..... More particularly, the stabilizer of mood or thymoregulator of association according to the invention will be lithium or the valproate. When the agomélatine is associated with a stabilizer of mood, it could be managed front, during or after the stabilizer of mood, provided that the time interval between the two administrations makes it possible to obtain the synergistic effect expected on the central nervous system. At the time of a simultaneous administration of the two components of association according to the invention, one préf' will erera a pharmaceutical composition containing the agomélatine and the stabilizing agent of mood, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. An aspect of the invention aims at a pharmaceutical composition containing of the agomélatine or one of its hydrates, crystalline forms or additive salts to an acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable base, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, intended for the manufacture of a drug for the treatment of the bipolar disorders. Another aspect of the invention aims at a pharmaceutical composition containing of the agomélatine or one of its hydrates, crystalline forms and additive salts to an acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable base, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, intended for the manufacture of a drug for the treatment of the bipolar disorders of type I. CA 02544136 2006-04-20 the pharmaceutical compositions will be presented in forms being appropriate for the administrations by way oral, parenteral, transcutanée, nasal, rectal, perlinguale, and in particular in the form of injectable preparations, compñmés, sublingual tablets, glossettes, gélules, capsules, shelves, suppositories, creams, pomades, gel dermic, etc… In addition to the agomélatine and the stabilizer of mood which is possibly associated for him, the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention contain one or more excipients or vehicles chosen among thinners, lubricants, binders, agents of disintegration, absorbents, dyes, sweetening substances, etc… As example and in a nonrestrictive way, one can quote " • for the thinners: lactose, dextrose, the sucrose, the mannitol, the sorbitol, the cellulose, glycerin, • for the lubricants: silica, talc, stearic acid and its calcium and magnesium salts, polyethylene glycol, • for the binders: magnesium and aluminium silicate, starch, gelatine, the tragacanth, methyl cellulose, the carboxymethyl cellulose of sodium and polyvinylpyrrolidone, • for disintegrating: agar, alginic acid and its salt of sodium, effervescent mixtures. Useful posology varies according to the sex, the age and the weight of the patient, the route of administration, the nature of the affection and the possibly associated treatments and spread out between 1 Mg and 50 Mg of agomélatine by 12 midnight. In a preferential way, the amount day labourer of agomélatine will be of 25 Mg per day.

A 6 weeks treatment by the agomélatine (25 mg/jour) was carried out. Among the patients, 19 continued the treatment beyond the 6 weeks of acute treatment, and 11 of them continued the treatment up to 1 year. The results obtained showed that 81% of the patients had accepted the treatment, with approximately 50% at the end of one only week of treatment. Only three episodes maniacs or hypomaniaques were observed after the 6 weeks of treatment, rate completely compatible with those met with a stabilizer of mood, showing well that the positive action of the agomélatine on the bipolar patients of type I is not correlated with an increase in the incidences maniacs and/or hypomaniaques even over a long life of treatment.
