Example 20A
Methyl 1-(2-methoxyethyl)-3,5-dimethyl-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate
1.246 g (3.825 mmol) of caesium carbonate were added to a solution of 402 mg (1.25 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 18A in 12.3 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 10 min. Then 452 mg (3.18 mmol) of iodomethane were added, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 22 h. The reaction mixture was then partitioned between water (75 ml) and dichloromethane (75 ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The residue obtained was chromatographed on silica gel (hexane/ethyl acetate eluent). 248 mg (59% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
