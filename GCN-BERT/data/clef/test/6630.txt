My present invention relates generally to dispensIng devices, and has particular reference to the dispensing of liquids. While mM invention is primarily directed toward the dispensing of a liquid such as ink from a container such as a bottle to facilitate the feedìng of the ink to the niba of a draftsman's pen, nevertheless it will be understood that my invention hs a far wider applicability. Merely for the purpose of explaining the nature of my invention, I have herein illustrated and shall hereinafter describe the manner in which the invention is applicable to an ink bottle o similar container. My invention ischaracterlzed by the association with a container fer he liquid of a means for controlling the flow of liquid out of the container, which in the preferred embodlmentcomprises an outlet tube so constructed and arranged that movement of theoutlet tube will automatically render said means operative to effect a discharge of liquid through theoutlet tube. Thus, with the outlet tube properly desígned for the purpose, the nibs of a draftsman's pen may be applied thereto and the movement of the outlet tube by the pen, itself, may be used to effect an expulsion o f ink through the outlet tube Into the nibs of the pen. Preferably, the flow-controlling means is of a character which is normally inoperative and which, when rende: ed operative, effects a definite expulsion of the liquid through the outlet tube. m i o In the preferred form of my invention, the liquid- ezpelling means comprises a deformable chamber adapted, when deformed, to diminish its volumetric capacity. I prefer to employ for this purpose a collapsible chamber comprising a hollow body of resilient deformable material such as rubber. From a broader aspect, my invention may be said to comprise a container having a compressible portion, the compressible portion being constituted of a hollow body of resilient deformable material, and the capillary outlet tube projecting from said portion and beingadapted by movement thereof to effect compression of said portion and consequent expulsion of liquid through theoutlet tube. While the compressible or deformable portion or body may be permanently aseoolated with the container, I prefer to construct the same in a manner which permits its removable applicable to a cóntalner or bottle which may, under certain circumstances, embody the conventional shape of ink bottles already on the market. In such an event, the present dispenser serves the additional functionof a closure for the bottle. Another feature of my invention lles in the optional association of the present unit with a separate support therefor. The unit may be mounted in the support in a pivotable manner, or it may be permanently or removably mounted in the support in relatively fixed relationship. I achieve the foregoing objeótm and advantages, and such other objects and advantages as may hereinafter appear or be pointed out, in the manner illustratively exemplified in the accompanying drawings, wherein - ï b «..I (. »k]I = Figure I is a side elevatlonal view of a dispensing unit embodying the features of my present invention; Figure is a front elevatlonal view of the same; Figure 3 is a view similar to Figure I, showing the container in pivoted relationship o the support; Figure 4 is a front view of Figure 3, illustrative showing the manner in which the nibs of a drafting pen may be employed for withdrawing ink from the container; Figure 5 is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the liquid-expelling means of Figures 1-4; Figure 6 is m view similar to Figure 5, showing the manner in which the means is distorted or deformed to effect expulsion of liquid; Figure 7 is an enlarged perspective view of the capillary outlet tube of Figures 5 and 6; Figure 8 is a view similar to Figure illustrating a modlfioation; Figure 9 is a view similar to Figure 7, illustra - ing a further modiflcatÆon; Figure I0 is a side elevational view of a modified form of llquid-dispenslng unit; Figure II is a view similar to Figure I0, showing the container in pivoted or adjustable relationship to the support; Figure 12 is a side elevatìonal view of a further modification of the unit; Figure 13 is a front dew of Figure 12; Figure 14 is an enlarged elevational view, partly in oboes-sectlon, showing a further modification of the invention and Figure 15 shows a further embodiment of my invention. ç ......... In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 1-4, a i support 80, preferably provided with non-skid feet or pro- k j Jections 21, comprises the spaced upstanding portions 22. Aligned notches at the top of the portions 88 serve as bearIngs for a pivot pin 23 which carries a ring 24. This ring is so constructed and arranged that it may be associated with the neck of a container B5 which is adapted to accommodate a supply of liquid such as ink. It will be understood that the ring 24 may, if desired, form a part of the container 25 or it may be an entirely separate element. Furthermore, It is to be understood that the container 25 may, itself, embody integral Journal portions adapted to be pivotally supported, either In a removable or permanent manner, in association with the upstanding portions 22 of the support. The characteristic features of the present disp se are indicated most clearly in Figures 5 and 6. On the assumption that the container 25 is of the more or less conventional character, composed of glass or the lime and comprising an outlet neck, a hollow body 26 le designed to be associated with the outlet neck to serve as a closure therefor. The body 26 is in the form of a hõllow chamber or hood and may be composed of resilient deformable material such as rubber. This body, as illustrated In Figures 5 and 6, comprises the slde walls 27 and the end wall 28i and in the end wall 28 I provide an integral neck portion 9 which is eccentrically positioned. Extending through the portion 89 is a capillary i outlet tube 50 which is mounted in llquid-tight association i with the hood or portion 86. The outlet tube is of relaI tively rigid material, such as vulcanized hard rubber or its equivalent, and comprises not only the capillary midportlon but also a tall portion 31 which extends hto the hollow deformable body. In the embodiment of Figures 5, 6 and 7, the tall portion 31 is arcuately formed, but this is not absolutely essential as will be pointed out presently. Where the device is intended for use by draftsmen or the llke, the outlet tube 30 is also provided with the forwardly projecting feeding portion 32 which may be forked, as shown in Figures 5-7, this portion being adapted to be grasped between the nibs 33 of a drafting pen, as shown in Figure 4. When the device is used, it normally assumes the position of Figures 1 and 2, the container 25 being firmly supported in substantially upright position with the deformable outlet chamber 2 arranged at the top, i.e., above the level of the liquid, such as ink, within the container. When the draftsman desires to withdraw ink from the container, he engages the portion 3 between the nlbs of his dzaftìng pen and swings the container into the position of Figures 3 and 4. This brings the outlet chamber or deformable hood member into a position below the lev of the liquid. Howevç liquid does not immediately flow out of the container because of the fact that the outlet tube has a capillary passage which normally prevents egress of liquid. By slightly moving the outlet tube, however, this being accomplished by the drafting pen, itself, the outlet tube may be caused to assume a position such as that shown in Figure 6. This movement brings about a distortion or deformation of the deformable chamber, as indicated generally by the reference numéral 34 in Figure 6. In the embodiment herein illustrated, this deformation is of a character which diminishes the volumetric capacity of the deformable chamber or hood, whereby a positive expulsion of liquid is brought about. During the movement of the outlet tube, the tail portion 31 braces itself against the adjacent side wall 27, and this facilitates the desired deformationor compresslon of the deformable member. It will be observed that the ink as it flows out of the outlet tube will pass directly into the spaces between the nlbs 35 of the drafting pen. Any desired quarry of ink may thus be withdrawn. Thereupon, the outlet tube is release and the container is permitted to assume the normal position of Figures 1 and The entire procedure, as hereinabove outlined, may obviously be carried out by the draftsman with only one hand. This leaves the other hand free to support his drawing board, T-square, triangles, etc., and, in general, this simplified one-handed procedure greatly facilitates the matter of feeding a new supply of ink to the drafting pen. In Figure 8 I have illustrated a modified type of capillary outlet tube in which the body portion 35 and the forwardly extending forked portion 36 are substantially the same as in Figure 7, but in which the tall portion 37 is substantially straight as compared with the arcuate t il portion Figure 7. l, .'" ìL i i! In Figure 9 I have illustrated a further modification of the outlet tube in which the tail portion 38 issubstantially straight, as in Figure 7, but in which the body portion 39 tapers forwardly to produce the wedge-shaped feeding projection When an outlet tube of the character illustrated in either Figures 8 or 9 is used with a deformable hood of the character shown, it is mounted more closely to the side wall 27 and in substantial parallelism with the latter, as illustrated most clearly in Figure 14. In Figures 1-4, the container has been shown in a pivotable relationship to a support, with the pivot axis substantially horizontal, In Figures lO and ll I have shown a modified unit in which the pivot axis is inclined approximately 70° to the horizontal. In Figures I0 and II a support 41 is provided with the flat inclined upper surface 42. At the approximate center of this surface, a circular bore 4 is provided to serve as a bearing for the pivot pin 44. This pivot pin isformed or mounted on the flattened under surface of a container 45 so that the container may be swung from the normal inoperative position of Figure i0 to the operative position of Figure II. Obviously, the mutual pivoting of the container 45 on the base 41 may be accomplìshed by means other than the illustrated expedient of the interengaging pin 44 and bore 43. In this embodiment, the container is provided with an outlet neck in association with which a deformable member 46 is mounted, This member will be substantially the same, in general character, as the hood illustrated and described in Figures 5 and 6; and a capillary outlet tube 47 projects from this deformable chamber in the manner shown. In connection with Figures I0 and II, it is not contemplated hat the container will be swung from the position of Figure lO to that of Figure Il each time the pen is to be filled, or each time that liquid is to be withdrawn. It has been found satisfactory and feasible to leave the unit in the position of Figure lO when it is not in use, and to swing it ìnto the position of Figure ll during operative pe%iode. It will be observed that in Figure lO the deformable member 46 is substantially above the level 48 of the liquid within the container 45; whereas theoutlet chamber 46 is below thins level w en the container is pivoted into the position of Figure ll. Even with the chamber the position of Figure II, no liquid will flow out of the outlet tube 47 until the latter is moved, either by the nibs of a drawing pen or otherwise. When so moved, the portion or member 46 will distort, as hereinbefore described, to effect an expulsion of liquid. In Figures 12 and iS I have illustrated a modificatlon in which the container 49 has tapered wall portions and a substantially flat end wall 51, the support in this case comprising the base 5 and the spaced upstanding portions 53. The portions 55 are so constructed and arranged with respect fo the walls 50 that the latter may be wedged into the position shown in Figures 12 and 1S. At other times the container 49 may be bodily removed from the support and stood upon the bottom wall 51. In this embodiment, a deformable outlet chamber 54 is associated with the container 49, and a capillary ourlet tube 55 projects therefrom and functions as hereinbefore described. Obviously, if desired, the unit of Figures 12 and 13 may be made of one piece in its entirety; or the container may be mounted in an irremovable manner within the support 58. Other means,of associating the container with a support, either pivotally or otherwise, will readily suggest themselves to those skilled in the art! and, except as expressed in the appended claims, I do not consider my invention to be restricted to the specific embodiments herein illustrated and described. Moreover, it will be obvious that the invention does not require the employment of a support at all; and, under certain olrcumstanoes, thecontainer, together with the deformable or compressible portion, and the capillary outlet tube, may constitute a complete unit by itself, independent of any additional support. In Figure 14 I have illustrated the applicability of my invention to a bottle or container of conventional character. The reference numeral 56 is applied to a glass bottle having the outlet neck 57. Assocla%ed with this outlet neck is a bored stopper portion 58 which carries the déformable hood or outlet chamber 59. The latter has he bore projection 60 in which i ii a capillary outlet tube 61 is mounted, this tube being substantlally of the character illustrated most clearly in Figure 9. Preferably, the portions 58 and 59 are made of one integral piece of soft rubber or the like which may be separately manufactured and sold, as a unit, in conjunction with the capillary outlet tube for use with a conventional bottle of the character designated 56. If desired, the bored stopper portion 58 need not necessarily project into the neck of the bottle but may, under certain circumstances, be applied to the neck of the bottle exteriorly thereof. In using the device of Figure 14, the bottle must be tipped either by hand or otherwise tò bring the deformable chamber below the level of the liquid, at which time the outlet tube may be engaged by the nlbs of a drawing pen, moved to distort the member 59, and thereby caused to disgorge nk into the pen. The entire unit of Figure 14, may, obviously, be mounted into pivotal association with a suï ble saddle or other contrivance for permitting a pivoting hereof, in which case the resultant assembly embodies substantially the characteristics illustrated in connection with Figures 1-4. In the embodiment of Figure 15 I have illustrated an arrangement in which a metal frame 70 comprises a base 71 and two side walls 72 arranged to receive between them the type of container designated by the reference numeral 73. This container is pivotally mounted on the frame 70 by -lO- ï i journal portions integrally formed on the container and cooperating with complementary formations on the frame More particularly, in the illustrated embodiment, the journal portions on the container take the form of integral projections 74 which are adapted fo be received in slots 75 in the walls 72. It will be understood, of course, that the elements formed in the bottle need not necessarily be projections but may be in the form o f depressions which would cooperate with complementary projections on the supporting frame. Attention is invited particularly to the height of the pivot axis with reference to the center of gravity, whìch is such as to cause the apparatus to function most efficiently from the standpoint (a) of normally maintaining the bottle in vertical position and returning it to that position automatlcally when the bottle is released, and (b) of requiring a minimum effort to til the bottle or container to its position of use, shown in dot-and-dash lines. This desirable objective is accomplished by a au the pivot axis above the center of gravity of the container, but closer to the center of gravity than the pivot axis of Figures 1-4. It will be understood that the container of Figures 1-4, and also the container of Figure 15, will always automatically assume its normal vertical position when released, even though the base or support happens to be resting on an inclined surface such as a drafting board. -llL It will also be understood that the feeding projections of the capillary outlet tube, as indicated by the reference numerals 3a, 36 and 40, need not necessarily assume the positions illustrated in the present drawings. For example, referring for purposes of explanation to Figures and 6 it may, under certain circumstances, be desirable to arrange the feeding projections 32 at the upper end of the body portion 30, tacher than at the lower end as shown in these Figures. Furthermore, the arcuate tail portion 31 of Figures and 6 may be swung the other way, if desired, whereby the convex surface of the rail portion braces itself against the side wall 27. As hereinbefore stated, the invention is not restrlot d in its applicability to the dispensing of ink and ma obviously, find wider utility in the dispensing of various types of liquids either into various types of Instrumentalltle serving a function similar to the drawing pen herein mentioned or otherwise. In general, it will be understood that changes in thÇ details, herein described and illustrated for the purpose of explaining the nature of my invention, may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit ah@ 3cope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims. is, therefore, intended that these details be interpreted Ls illustrative, and not in a limiting sense.
