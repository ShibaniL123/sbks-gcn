FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention is related to a process for the preparation ospemifene and to intermediate compounds used in the process. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Ospemifene or (Z)-2-[4-(4-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-but-1-enyl)phenoxy]ethanol is represented by formula (I): Ospemifene is an estrogen receptor agonist/antagonist currently investigated e.g. for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause. Preparation of ospemifene starting from Z-4-(4-hydroxy-1,2-diphenyl-but-1-enyl)phenol has been described in WO 96/07402. Use of McMurry coupling reaction wherein two ketone groups are coupled to produce an alkene compound has been suggested for the manufacture of ospemifene. WO 2008/099059 describes McMurry coupling, between commercially available starting materials, 4-hydroxybenzophenone (or (4-hydroxyphenyl)(phenyl)methanone) and 3-chloropropiophenone, to produce mainly Z-isomer of 4-(4-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-but-1-enyl)phenol intermediate of ospemifene. McMurry coupling between 4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)benzophenone and 3-chloropropiophenone to give mainly Z-isomer of the end product (ospemifene) has been described in WO 2011/089385. McMurry coupling reaction is known to be susceptible to side reactions as two molecules of the same starting material react with each other (homocoupling). It was found that the above described McMurry processes for preparing ospemifene suffer from the drawback that the hydroxyl substituted end product of the McMurry coupling reaction is cumbersome to isolate from the homocoupling impurities, (VIIa and VIIb), that are formed in the reaction, particularly if high yield of the end product is desired. Thus, it is desirable to provide an improved method for producing ospemifene in high yield and purity, the method also being economically feasible, operationally practical and suitable for use in a large scale. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) which process comprises (a) reacting a compound of formula (IIIa) wherein Ra is a protective group which is benzyl, wherein the phenyl ring of the benzyl group is optionally substituted, or C(O)—Rb, wherein Rb is C1-5 alkyl or an optionally substituted phenyl, with 3-chloropropiophenone to produce a compound of formula (IVa) wherein Ra is as defined above, and (b) subjecting the compound of formula (IVa) to the removal of the protective group to give a compound of formula (I) One embodiment of the invention is a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) which process comprises a) reacting a compound of formula (IIIb) wherein Rb is as defined before, with 3-chloropropiophenone to produce a compound of formula (IVb) wherein Rb is as defined above, and (b) subjecting the compound of formula (IVb) to cleavage of the ester bond of the Rb—C(O)O group to give a compound of formula (I). Another embodiment of the present invention is process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) which process comprises (a) reacting a compound of formula (IIIa) wherein Ra is benzyl wherein the phenyl ring of the benzyl group is optionally substituted, with 3-chloropropiophenone to produce a compound of formula (IVa) wherein Ra is benzyl wherein the phenyl ring of the benzyl group is optionally substituted, and (b) subjecting the compound of formula (IVa) to cleavage of the ether bond to give a compound of formula (I). In another aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) comprising the step of removing the protective group Ra from compound of formula (IVa). In another aspect, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) comprising the step of cleaving the ester bond of a compound of formula (IVb), wherein Rb is C1-5 alkyl or an optionally substituted phenyl, to give a compound of formula (I). Still in another aspect, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of compound of formula (I) comprising the step of cleaving the ether bond of a compound of formula (IVa), wherein Ra is benzyl wherein the phenyl ring of the benzyl group is optionally substituted, to give a compound of formula (I). The invention is also directed to novel compounds of formula (IVb) wherein Rb is C1-5 alkyl or an optionally substituted phenyl, and to a novel compound of formula (IIIb), wherein Rb is t-butyl. It has been found that, in contrast, to hydroxyl substituted McMurry coupling products used earlier in the preparation of ospemifene, the compounds of formula (IVa) can be easily isolated in high yield and purity by a simple crystallization step. The relatively low solubility, of compounds of formula (IVa) to lower alcohols allows crystallization from plain lower alcohols or from a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbon and lower alcohol. Such crystallizations have, been found to effectively isolate the compound of formula (IVa) from its homocoupling impurities in high yield. Ospemifene can then be obtained from the compound of formula (IVa) by removing the protective group while the amount of homocoupling impurities, such us the impurities of formula (VIIa) and (VIIb), remains low.

In still another′ embodiment, the leaving group L′ is Cl and Rb is t-butyl. In still another embodiment, the leaving group L′ is Cl and Rb is phenyl. According to one embodiment, the compound of formula (IIIb) is prepared by reacting the compound of formula (II) with a compound, of formula Rb—C(O)—Cl, wherein Rb is C1-5 alkyl or an optionally substituted phenyl. This esterification reaction is suitably carried out by dissolving the compound of formula (II) in suitable organic solvent such as dichloromethane (DCM) or xylenes together with a base such as triethylamine. The compound of formula Rb—C(O)—Cl is then added under cooling. The mixture may be further stirred e.g. at room temperature. The reaction is typically Completed within 12 hours or less. Reaction may be quenched by aqueous HCl solution. The organic phase is isolated, washed, filtered and evaporated to obtain the compound of formula (IIIb). In one embodiment the evaporation can be omitted and compound of formula (IIIb) can be stored and used as xylene solution. As an alternative to esterification reaction, the compound of formula (IIIb) may be prepared via Friedel-Crafts acylation by reacting a compound of formula (V) wherein Rb is C1-5 alkyl or an optionally substituted phenyl, with a compound of formula (VI) wherein L″ is a leaving group. Suitable leaving groups L″ include, but are not limited to, halogen and hydroxyl. Typically, the reaction is catalyzed by a Brønstedt acid, such as polyphosphoric acid (PPA) when L″ is hydroxyl and by Lewis acids when L″ is halogen. According to one embodiment the compound of formula (IIIb) is prepared by reacting the compound of formula (V), wherein Rb is C1-5 alkyl or an optionally substituted phenyl, with benzoic acid in the presence of polyphosphoric acid (PPA). Benzoic acid and compound of formula (V), wherein Rb is C1-5 alkyl or an optionally substituted phenyl, are suitably added to warmed PPA.

Organic phase may then be washed, filtered and evaporated to obtain the Compound of formula (IIIb): Other, routes for the preparation of a compound of formula (IIIb) are readily available for a skilled person by utilizing methods well known in the art. Compound formula (IIIa); wherein Ra is benzyl, wherein the phenyl ring of the benzyl group is optionally substituted can be prepared using methods, known in the art. For example compound of formula (IIIa) can be prepared by etherification of compound of formula (II). Etherification of compound can be accomplished in numerous ways. For example compound of formula (II) can be reacted with an compound of formula RaL′″ wherein L′″ is a suitable leaving group and Ra is benzyl wherein the phenyl ring of, the benzyl group is optionally substituted. The, compound of formula RaL′″ can be in the form of alkyl halide (Cl, Br, I), alkyl sulfonate (eg. OTs, OMs, OTf) or alkyl-trichloroacetimidate (ONHCCl3). Etherification can be carried out in basic, acidic or neutral conditions. Details of various etherification conditions can be found in standard textbooks such as Greene, T. W. et al., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3. Edition, Wiley, 1999 and Sasson, Y.; Neumann, R. Handbook of Phase Transfer Catalysis 1. Edition, Blackie Academic and Professional Chapman & Hall, 1997. In one embodiment the leaving group of the formula Ra-L′″ is chloride and Ra is benzyl. Reaction is suitable carried out in xylenes together with base and phase transfer catalyst, like described in WO 01/36360A1. After aqueous work up and concentration the compound of formula (IIIa) is obtained as xylene solution. Xylene solution of compound of formula (IIIa) can be used directly in the following step. Ospemifene is obtained from compound of formula (IVa) by removing the hydroxyl protecting group Ra. If Ra is C(O)—Rb, ospemifene is obtained by a cleavage of the ester bond (dashed bond below) such that the hydroxyl group of ospemifene is formed. The cleavage of the ester bond can be carried out by using well known methods such as hydrolysis or a reductive cleavage. Hydrolysis can be catalysed by, a base or an acid. Abase catalysed hydrolysis is particularly preferred. The base catalysed hydrolysis can be carried out in a suitable solvent such as aqueous THF or aqueous THF/MeOH mixture in the presence of a suitable base, such as NaOH, KOH or LiOH at room temperature for a time sufficient to complete the hydrolysis. When the hydrolysis is carried out at room temperature, the reaction is completed typically within 12 hours or less. Thereafter, water and suitable organic solvent such as EtOAc or toluene is added. The mixture is then acidificated, the phases are separated and the organic phase is washed, dried, filtered and concentrated. Ospemifene can be conveniently isolated from the residue by crystallization from a suitable crystallization solvent. Preferred solvents for crystallization are C1-5 alcohols, particularly methdriol, ethanol or isopropanol, or aqueous C1-5 alcohols such as aqueous methanol (e.g. 80% or 90% methanol). Reductive cleavage can be carried out in the presence of a reducing agent such as lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4) in a suitable organic solvent such as toluene, THF, hexane or xylenes or mixture thereof. The reaction is suitably carried out at room temperature or below and under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction may be suitably quenched by addition of saturated NH4Cl-solution. Organic phase is washed, dried, filtered and concentrated. Ospemifene can be conveniently isolated from the residue by crystallization froth a suitable crystallization solvent as described above. If Ra is benzyl wherein the phenyl ring of the benzyl group is optionally substituted, the cleavage takes place in the ether bond (dashed line below). The Cleavage of the ether bond can be carried out using well known methods such as hydrogenolysis. Details of various hydrogenation conditions can be found in standard textbooks such as Greene, T. W. et al., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3. Edition, Wiley, 1999. Hydrogenolysis of the ether bond of the compound of formula (IVa) wherein Ra is benzyl wherein the phenyl ring of the benzyl group is optionally substituted, can be catalysed by transition metals. The Pd-catalyzed hydrogenolysis is particularly preferred. The catalytic hydrogenation can be carried, out in suitable solvents such as alcohols, at elevated temperatures under a pressure of hydrogen for a time sufficient to complete the hydrogenolysis. After completion of the reaction the catalyst is filtered and the filtrate is allowed to cool slowly and seeded with pure ospemifene. Cooling is continued at temperature <10° C. for more than 3 hours and crystalline ospemifene is isolated by filtration. Ospemifene can be re-crystallized if needed from C1-5 alcohols or aqueous C1-5 alcohols. Ospemifene obtained by the method of the invention, has particularly high, over 99.5%, purity as it is devoid of homocoupling impurities such as the impurities of formula (VIIa) and (VIIb) typically involved in McMurry coupling reaction.
