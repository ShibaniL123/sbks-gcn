More specifically, the invention relates to a liquid crystal composition having a positive dielectric anisotropy, and a device that contains the composition and has a twisted nematic (TN) mode, an optically compensated bend (OCB) mode, an inch-plane switching (IPS) mode or a polymer sustained alignment (PSA) mode. Background Art In a liquid crystal display device, a classification based on an operating mode for liquid crystals includes a phase change (PC) mode, a twisted nematic (TN) mode, a super twisted nematic (STN) mode, an electrically controlled birefringence (ECB) mode, an optically compensated bend (OCB) mode, an in-plane switching (IPS) mode, a vertical alignment (VA) mode and a polymer sustained alignment (PSA) mode. A classification based on a driving mode in a device includes a passive matrix (PM) and an active matrix (AM). The PM is further classified into static, multiplex and so forth, and the AM is classified into a thin film transistor (TFT), a metal insulator metal (MIM) and so forth. The TFT is further classified into amorphous silicon TFT and polycrystal silicon TFT. The latter is classified into a high temperature type and a low temperature type according to a production process. A classification based on a light source includes a reflective type utilizing natural light, a transmissive type utilizing backlight and a transflective type utilizing both the natural light and the backlight. The devices contain a liquid crystal composition having suitable characteristics. The liquid crystal composition has a nematic phase.

An optical anisotropy of the composition relates to a contrast ratio in the device. A product (Δn × d) of the optical anisotropy (Δn) of the composition and a cell gap (d) in the device is designed so as to maximize the contrast ratio. A suitable value of the product depends on a type of the operating mode. The suitable value is about 0.45 micrometer in a device having the mode such as TN. In the above case, a composition having a large optical anisotropy is preferred for a device having a small cell gap. A large dielectric anisotropy in the composition contributes to a low threshold voltage, a small electric power consumption and a large contrast ratio in the device. Accordingly, the large dielectric anisotropy is preferred. A large specific resistance in the composition contributes to a large voltage holding ratio and a large contrast ratio in the device. A composition having a large specific resistance at room temperature and also at a temperature close to a maximum temperature of the nematic phase in an initial stage is preferred. A composition having a large specific resistance at room temperature and also at a temperature close to the maximum temperature of the nematic phase after the device has been used for a long period of time is preferred. Stability of the composition to ultraviolet light and heat relates to a service life of the liquid crystal display device. In the case where the stability thereto is high, the device has a long service life. Such characteristics are preferred for an AM device used in a liquid crystal projector, a liquid crystal television and so forth. A large elastic constant in the composition contributes to a large contrast ratio and a short response time in the device. Therefore, the large elastic constant is preferred. A composition having a positive dielectric anisotropy is used for an AM device having the TN mode. On the other hand, a composition having a negative dielectric anisotropy is used for an AM device having the VA mode. A composition having a positive or negative dielectric anisotropy is used for an AM device having the IPS mode. A composition having a positive or negative dielectric anisotropy is used for an AM device having the PSA mode. Examples of the liquid crystal compositions having the positive dielectric anisotropy are disclosed in the following Patent literatures No. 1 to No. 8. However, the liquid crystal compositions disclosed in the literatures contain a cyano compound, and therefore the voltage holding ratio is low. Therefore, the liquid crystal compositions are not suitable for use in the AM device. In particular, the stability of the compositions to ultraviolet light is significantly low.

Examples In order to evaluate characteristics of a composition and a compound to be contained in the composition, the composition and the compound were made a measurement obj ect. When the measurement obj ect was the composition, the composition was measured as a sample as is, and values obtained were described. When the measurement object was the compound, a sample for measurement was prepared by mixing the compound (15% by weight) into mother liquid crystals (85% by weight) . Values of characteristics of the compound were calculated according to an extrapolation method using values obtained by measurement: (extrapolated value) = { (measured value of a sample for measurement) - 0.85 × (measured value of mother liquid crystals)} / 0.15. When a smectic phase (or crystals) precipitated at the ratio thereof at 25°C, a ratio of the compound to the mother liquid crystals was changed step by step in the order of (10% by weight : 90% by weight), (5% by weight : 95% by weight) and (1% by weight: 99% by weight) Values of a maximum temperature, an optical anisotropy, viscosity and a A ratio of each component was expressed in terms of weight percent. Characteristics were measured according to the methods described below. Most of the methods are applied as described in EIAJ ED-2521A of the Standard of Electronic Industries Association of Japan, or as modified thereon. Maximum Temperature of a Nematic Phase (NI; °C): A sample was placed on a hot plate in a melting point apparatus equipped with a polarizing microscope and was heated at a rate of 1°C per minute. Temperature when a part of the sample began to change from a nematic phase to an isotropic liquid was measured. A higher limit of a temperature range of the nematic phase may be abbreviated as "maximum temperature." Minimum Temperature of a Nematic Phase (Tc; °C): A sample having a nematic phase was put in glass vials, and the vials were kept in freezers at temperatures of 0°C, -10°C, -20°C, -30°C and -40°C for 10 days, and then liquid crystal phases were observed. For example, when the sample maintained the nematic phase at -20°C and changed to crystals or a smectic phase at -30°C, Tc was expressed as Tc ≤ -20°C. A lower limit of the temperature range of the nematic phase may be abbreviated 10 days, and then liquid crystal phases were observed. For example, when the sample maintained the nematic phase at -20°C and changed to crystals or a smectic phase at -30°C, Tc was expressed as Tc ≤ -20°C. A lower limit of the temperature range of the nematic phase may be abbreviated as "minimum temperature." Viscosity (bulk viscosity; η; measured at 20°C; mPa·s) : A cone-plate (E type) viscometer was used for measurement. Viscosity (rotational viscosity; γ1; measured at 25°C; mPa·s): Measurement was carried out according to the method described in M. Imai et al., Molecular Crystals and Liquid Crystals, Vol. 259, p. 37 (1995). A sample was put in a TN device in which a twist angle was 0 degrees and a distance (cell gap) between two glass substrates was 5 micrometers. A voltage was stepwise applied to the device in the range of 16 V to 19.5 V at an increment of 0.5 V. After a period of 0.2 second with no application, a voltage was repeatedly applied under the conditions of only one of rectangular waves (rectangular pulse; 0.2 second) and no application (2 seconds) . A peak current and peak time of a transient current generated by the application were measured. A value of rotational viscosity was obtained from the measured values and calculation equation (8) described on page 40 of the paper presented by M. Imai et al. A value of dielectric anisotropy necessary for the calculation was determined by the method described below by using the device in which the rotational viscosity was measured. Optical Anisotropy (refractive index anisotropy; Δn; measured at 25°C): Measurement was carried out by means of an Abbe refractometer with a polarizing plate mounted on an ocular, using light at a wavelength of 589 nanometers. A surface of a main prism was rubbed in one direction, and then a sample was added dropwise onto the main prism. A refractive index (n∥) was measured when the direction of polarized light was parallel to the direction of rubbing. A refractive index (n⊥) was measured when the direction of polarized light was perpendicular to the direction of rubbing. A value of optical anisotropy was calculated from an equation: Δn = n∥ - n⊥. Dielectric Anisotropy (Δε; measured at 25°C) : A sample was put in a TN device in which a distance (cell gap) between two glass substrates was 9 micrometers and a twist angle was 80 degrees. Sine waves (10 V, 1 kHz) were applied to the device, and after 2 seconds, a dielectric constant (ε∥) in the major axis direction of liquid crystal molecules was measured. Sine waves (0.5 V, 1 kHz) were applied to the device, and after 2 seconds, a dielectric constant (ε⊥) in the minor axis direction of the liquid crystal molecules was measured. A value of dielectric anisotropy was calculated from an equation: Δε = ε∥ - ε⊥. Threshold Voltage (Vth; measured at 25°C; V): An LCD-5100 luminance meter made by Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd. was used for measurement. A light source was a halogen lamp. A sample was put in a normally white mode TN device in which a distance (cell gap) between two glass substrates was 0.45/Δn (µm) and a twist angle was 80 degrees. A voltage (32 Hz, rectangular waves) to be applied to the device was stepwise increased from 0 V to 10 V at an increment of 0.02 V. On the occasion, the device was irradiated with light from a direction perpendicular to the device, and the amount of light passing through the device was measured. A voltage-transmittance curve was prepared, in which the maximum amount of light corresponds to 100% transmittance and the minimum amount of light corresponds to 0% transmittance. A threshold voltage is a voltage at 90% transmittance. Voltage Holding Ratio (VHR-1; at 25°C; %) : A TN device used for measurement had a polyimide alignment film, and a distance (cell gap) between two glass substrates was 5 micrometers. A sample was put in the device, and then the device was sealed with an ultraviolet-curable adhesive. A pulse voltage (60 microseconds at 5 V) was applied to the device, and the device was charged. A decaying voltage was measured for 16.7 milliseconds with a high-speed voltmeter, and area A between a voltage curve and a horizontal axis in a unit cycle was determined. Area B is an area without decay. A voltage holding ratio is a percentage of area A to area B. Voltage Holding Ratio (VHR-2; at 80°C; %) : A TN device used for measurement had a polyimide alignment film, and a distance (cell gap) between two glass substrates was 5 micrometers. A sample was put in the device, and then the device was sealed with an ultraviolet-curable adhesive. A pulse voltage (60 microseconds at 5 V) was applied to the TN device and the device was charged. A decaying voltage was measured for 16.7 milliseconds with a high-speed voltmeter, and area A between a voltage curve and a horizontal axis in a unit cycle was determined. Area B is an area without decay. A voltage holding ratio is a percentage of area A to area B. Voltage Holding Ratio (VHR-3; at 25°C; %): Stability to ultraviolet light was evaluated by measuring a voltage holding ratio after a device was irradiated with ultraviolet light. A composition having a large VHR-3 has a high stability to ultraviolet light. A TN device used for measurement had a polyimide alignment film and a cell gap was 5 micrometers. A sample was injected into the device, and then the device was irradiated with light for 20 minutes. A light source was an ultra high-pressure mercury lamp USH-500D (made by Ushio, Inc.), and a distance between the device and the light source was 20 centimeters. In measuring VHR-3, a decaying voltage was measured for 16.7 milliseconds. The composition having a large VHR-3 has a high stability to ultraviolet light. A value of VHR-3 is preferably in the range of 90% or more, further preferably, 95% or more. Voltage Holding Ratio (VHR-4; at 25°C; %): Stability to heat was evaluated by measuring a voltage holding ratio after a TN device into which a sample was injected was heated in a constant-temperature bath at 80°C for 500 hours. In measuring VHR-4, a decaying voltage was measured for 16.7 milliseconds. A composition having a large VHR-4 has a high stability to heat. Response Time (τ; measured at 25°C; ms) : An LCD-5100 luminance meter made by Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd. was used for measurement. A light source was a halogen lamp. A low-pass filter was set at 5 kHz. A sample was put in a normally white mode TN device in which a distance (cell gap) between two glass substrates was 5.0 micrometers and a twist angle was 80 degrees. Rectangular waves (60 Hz, 5 V, 0.5 second) were applied to the device. On the occasion, the device was irradiated with light from a direction perpendicular to the device, and the amount of light passing through the device was measured. The maximum amount of light corresponds to 100% transmittance, and the minimum amount of light corresponds to 0% transmittance. Rise time (τr; millisecond) is a period of time required for a change from 90% transmittance to 10% transmittance. Fall time (τf; millisecond) is a period of time required for a change from 10% transmittance to 90% transmittance. Response time is a sum of the rise time and the fall time thus determined. Elastic Constant (K; measured at 25°C; pN) : HP4284A LCR meter made by Yokogawa-Hewlett-Packard Co. was used for measurement. A sample was put in a homogeneous alignment cell in which a distance (cell gap) between two glass substrates was 20 micrometers. An electric charge of 0 V to 20 V was applied to the cell, and an electrostatic capacity and an applied voltage were measured. Measured values of the electrostatic capacity (C) and the applied voltage (V) were fitted to equation (2.98) and equation (2.101), and thus values of K11 and K13 were obtained from equation (2.99), the equations being described on page 75 of "Liquid Crystal Device Handbook" (Ekisho Debaisu Handobukku in Japanese) (The Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Ltd.). Next, K22 was calculated by fitting the values of K11 and K33 determined previously to equation (3.18) on page 171 of the same Handbook. An elastic constant is a mean of K11, K22 and K33 thus determined. Specific Resistance (ρ; measured at 25°C; Ωcm) : Into a vessel equipped with an electrode, 1.0 milliliter of a sample was injected. A DC voltage (10 V) was applied to the vessel, and a DC current after 10 seconds was measured. A specific resistance was calculated from the following equation: specific resistance=voltage×electric capacity of vessel/DC current×dielectric constant of vacuum. Gas Chromatographic Analysis: GC-14B gas chromatograph made by Shimadzu Corporation was used for measurement. A carrier gas was helium (2 mL per minute). A sample injector and a detector (FID) were set to 280°C and 300°C, respectively. A capillary column DB-1 (length 30 m, bore 0.32 mm, film thickness 0.25 µm; dimethylpolysiloxane as a stationary phase, non-polar) made by Agilent Technologies, Inc. was used for separation of component compounds. After the column was kept at 200°C for 2 minutes, the column was heated to 280°C at a rate of 5°C per minute. A sample was prepared in an acetone solution (0.1% by weight), and then 1 microliter of the solution was injected into the sample injector. A recorder was C-R5A Chromatopac made by Shimadzu Corporation or the equivalent thereof. The resulting gas chromatogram showed retention time of a peak and a peak area corresponding to each of the component compounds. As a solvent for diluting the sample, chloroform, hexane and so forth may also be used. The following capillary columns may also be used for separating the component compounds: HP-1 (length 30 m, bore 0.32 mm, film thickness 0.25 µm) made by Agilent Technologies, Inc., Rtx-1 (length 30 m, bore 0.32 mm, film thickness 0.25 µm) made by Restek Corporation and BP-1 (length 30 m, bore 0.32 mm, film thickness 0.25 µm) made by SGE International Pty. Ltd. A capillary column CBP1-M50-025 (length 50 m, bore 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 µm) made by Shimadzu Corporation may also be used for the purpose of avoiding an overlap of peaks of the compounds. A ratio of liquid crystal compounds contained in a composition may be calculated by the method as described below. The liquid crystal compounds can be detected by means of a gas chromatograph. A ratio of peak areas in a gas chromatogram corresponds to a ratio (in the number of moles) of the liquid crystal compounds. When the capillary columns described above were used, a correction coefficient of each of the liquid crystal compounds may be regarded as 1 (one). Accordingly, a ratio (% by weight) of the liquid crystal compounds was calculated from the ratio of the peak areas. The invention will be explained in detail by way of Examples. The invention is not limited by the Examples described below. The compounds described in Comparative Examples and Examples were expressed using symbols according to definitions in Table 3 below. In Table 3, a configuration of 1,4-cyclohexylene is trans. A parenthesized number next to a symbolized compound in Examples corresponds to the number of the compound. A symbol (-) means any other liquid crystal compound. A ratio (percentage) of liquid crystal compounds is expressed in terms of weight percent (% by weight) based on the total weight of the liquid crystal composition. The liquid crystal composition further contains an impurity. Last, values of characteristics of the composition were summarized.
