Step 3. 6-Cyano-1-trityl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine 4-oxide
A vial was charged with 6-bromo-1-trityl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine 4-oxide (1.623 g, 3.56 mmol), dicyanozinc (1.691 g, 14.40 mmol), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (376.8 mg, 0.411 mmol) and 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene (455.4 mg, 0.787 mmol). The vial was sealed, evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen (this process was repeated a total of three times). A solution of TMEDA (341.5 mg, 2.94 mmol) in DMF (15.0 ml) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 110Â° C. for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered. The filter cake was washed with DCM. The filtrate was concentrated. The resultant residue was purified on silica gel (120 g, 0-100% EtOAc in DCM) to give the desired product as a yellow foamy solid (894.5 mg, 63%).
