(2S,3R,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-4-[(5-cyclobutyl-2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)methoxy]-1-{[(propan-2-yl)oxy]carbonyl}-5-{2-[(propan-2-yl)oxy]pyridin-3-yl}pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid
Example 95A
(2S,3R,4S,5S)-2-ethyl 1-isopropyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(2-isopropoxypyridin-3-yl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylate
To (2S,3R,4S,5S)-ethyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(2-isopropoxypyridin-3-yl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (Core 7) (2.00 g, 5.27 mmol) and triethylamine (5.88 mL, 42.2 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) was added isopropyl carbonochloridate (3.88 g, 31.6 mmol) drop wise at ambient temperature. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours, and dichloromethane (20 mL) and water (10 mL) added. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification of the residue via chromatography, eluting with ethyl acetate in heptanes provided the title compound (2.26 g, 92% yield).
