LaCourse et al., which in turn claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Number 61/141,570 filed Dec. 30, 2008, entitled “CERAMIC SCINTILLATOR BODY AND SCINTILLATION DEVICE,” by Brian C. LaCourse et al., all of which are all incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure is directed to scintillator devices, particularly ruggedized scintillator devices for industrial applications, and to ceramic scintillator bodies. BACKGROUND Scintillation devices are used in a variety of industrial applications. For example, scintillation devices are used for well logging in the oil and gas industry and for imaging scans in the medical field. Typically, scintillation devices include scintillator bodies, such as a scintillator crystal, produced from a material that is effective to detect gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet radiation or other radiation. The scintillator bodies can absorb x-rays or other radiation and emit light. The emitted light can sometimes be recorded on film. Generally, the scintillator bodies are enclosed in casings or sleeves that include a window to permit radiation-induced scintillation light to pass out of the crystal package. The light passes to a light-sensing device such as a photomultiplier tube, a photodiode, or another photosensor that converts the light emitted from the scintillator body into electrical pulses. In other applications, multiple scintillator bodies can be used in imaging arrays for medical imaging equipment. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The present disclosure may be better understood, and its numerous features and advantages made apparent to those skilled in the art by referencing the accompanying drawings.

The use of the same reference symbols in different drawings indicates similar or identical items. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Numerous innovative teachings of the present application will be described with particular reference to exemplary embodiments. However, it should be understood that this class of embodiments provides only a few examples of the many advantageous uses of the innovative teachings herein. In general, statements made in the specification of the present application do not necessarily limit any of the various claimed articles, systems, or methods. Moreover, some statements may apply to some inventive features but not to others. The demands of well logging and medical imaging benefit from scintillation devices that are accurate under harsh and fast conditions. Various classes of scintillating materials can be used to produce scintillator bodies depending on intended applications. For example, single crystal oxyorthosilicates, such as lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO), are often used in medical imaging applications, such as positron emission tomography (PET). These materials are typically characterized by relatively high stopping power and fast decay times. Nonetheless, LYSO is often characterized by low light output, and performance in PET scan applications can suffer from electron emission resulting from the β− decay of lutetium. Another class of scintillating materials includes ceramic rare earth sulfoxylates, such as gadolinium oxysulfide (GOS). Ceramic materials such as GOS can be less costly than single crystal materials, such as LYSO. However, the hexagonal structure of ceramic rare earth sulfoxylates often causes “birefringence,” or light scattering at grain boundaries. As a result, such materials are less transparent and exhibit less light output or brightness than many single crystal materials. Consequently, improvements in scintillator efficiency and brightness that might be caused by the compatibility of ceramic rare earth sulfoxylates with certain activators are typically diminished by the reduced transparency that results from their hexagonal structures. FIG. 1 shows a particular embodiment of a radiation detector device 100. The radiation detector device 100 includes a photosensor 101, a light pipe 103, and a scintillation device 105. Though the photosensor 101, the light pipe 103, and the scintillation device 105 are illustrated separately from each other, it is to be understood that the photosensor 101 and the scintillation device 105 are adapted to be coupled to each other via the light pipe 103. In one embodiment, the photosensor 101 includes a device capable of spectral detection and resolution. For example, the photosensor 101 can comprise a conventional photomultiplier tube (PMT), a hybrid photodetector, or a photodiode. The photosensor 101 is adapted to receive photons emitted by the scintillation device 105 after absorbing x-rays or other radiation, and the photosensor 101 is adapted to produce electrical pulses or imaging signals from photons that it receives. The electronics 130 can include one or more electronic devices, such as an amplifier, a pre-amplifier, a discriminator, an analog-to-digital signal converter, a photon counter, another electronic device, or any combination thereof. The photosensor 101 can be housed within a tube or housing made of a material capable of protecting electronics associated with the photosensor 101, such as a metal, metal alloy, other material, or any combination thereof. As illustrated, the light pipe 103 is disposed between the photosensor 101 and the scintillation device 105 and facilitates optical coupling between the photosensor 101 and the scintillation device 105. In one embodiment, the light pipe 103 can include a quartz light pipe, plastic light pipe, or another light pipe. In another embodiment, the light pipe 103 can comprise a silicone rubber interface that optically couples an output window 119 of the scintillation device 105 with an input window of the photosensor 101. In some embodiments, multiple light pipes can be disposed between the photosensor 101 and the scintillation device 105. The scintillation device 105 includes a scintillator body 107 housed within a casing 115. The scintillator body 107 can have various shapes, such as a rectangular shape, or a cylindrical surface including flat end faces. It will be appreciated that the surface finish of the scintillator body 107 can be sanded, polished, ground, etc., as desired. The scintillator body 107 has a length that extends from a first end that is proximal to the photosensor 101 and a second end that is distal from the photosensor 101. The scintillation device 105 also includes a reflector 109 substantially surrounding the scintillator body 107. In addition, the scintillation device 105 can include a boot 111 that acts as a shock absorber to prevent damage to the scintillator body 107. The boot 111 can comprise a polymer, such as silicone rubber, another material, or a combination thereof. Further, the scintillation device 105 can also include a casing 113. In a particular embodiment, the scintillator body 107 is a ceramic scintillator body that includes a polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material having a substantially cubic crystallographic structure. The polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material has a chemical composition represented by a general formula Lu(2-x)GdxO3:Ac. The value of x is greater than 0 and less than 2. For instance, the value of x can be greater than zero and less than or equal to one, such as in the chemical composition represented by the general formula LuGdO3:Ac. Alternatively, the value of x can be greater than 1 and less than 2, such as in the chemical composition represented by the general formula Lu0.5Gd1.5O3:Ac. As represented in the general formula, the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material also includes an activator, Ac. The activator causes the scintillator body 107 to emit visible light or ultraviolet light after absorbing gamma radiation, x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or other radiation. The activator can include a rare earth element, such as a lanthanide element. For example, the activator can include cerium, europium, praseodymium, samarium, terbium, or ytterbium. In an illustrative embodiment, the activator comprises less than or equal to approximately ten percent (10%) of the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material, such as less than or equal to approximately five percent (5%) or less than or equal to approximately two percent (2%) of the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material. In another embodiment, the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material includes a co-dopant. The co-dopant can include an aliovalent cation. For example, the co-dopant can be a divalent cation, such as calcium. In another example, the co-dopant can be a quatrovalent cation, such as zirconium. In yet another example, the co-dopant can include a rare earth element that is different from the activator, such as cerium, terbium, praseodymium, europium, or any combination thereof. In an illustrative embodiment, the activator and co-dopant can collectively comprise less than or equal to approximately ten percent (10%) of the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material, such as less than or equal to approximately five percent (5%) or less than or equal to approximately two percent (2%) of the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material. For instance, the co-dopant can comprise less than or equal to approximately five percent (5%) of the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material. In an illustrative embodiment, the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material can be characterized by a grain size of from approximately 1 μm to approximately 100 μm. Additionally, the scintillator body 107 can also be characterized by a density of greater than 98%, such as greater than or equal to 99.9%, of theoretical density. In addition, the scintillator body 107 can be characterized by an optical transmittance of greater than fifty percent (50%) total transmission at a scintillator body thickness that stops greater than 98% of x-ray or other radiation at a wavelength of maximum emission. In addition, the scintillator body 107 can be characterized by a decay time of less than 1 ms. The scintillator body 107 can also be characterized by a high stopping power, such as with an atomic number (eff Z) of greater than approximately 62. FIG. 2 illustrates a particular embodiment of x-ray scanning equipment 200, such as x-ray computed tomography (CT) equipment. The x-ray scanning equipment 200 includes an array 202 of scintillator devices, or pixels, and a segmented photodetector 210. The x-ray scanning equipment 200 also includes an x-ray source 206 adapted to emit x-rays 204, e.g., in a fan-shaped or cone-shaped pattern. The x-ray source 206 and the array 202 of scintillator devices may be adapted to rotate about an object 208. For example, the x-ray source 206 and the array 202 may be adapted to rotate opposite each other substantially along a circle centered about the object 208 and at substantially equal rates. In a particular embodiment, each pixel in the array 202 includes a ceramic scintillator body. Each ceramic scintillator body is adapted to absorb x-rays 204 emitted by the x-ray source 206 and to emit scintillation light 214 that feeds into the segmented photodetector 210. The segmented photodetector 210 is adapted to measure scintillation light 214 received from each pixel and to determine from which pixel the particular scintillation light is received. The segmented photodetector 210 is adapted to produce signals based on the amount of scintillation light emitted by each pixel in the array 202 from various angles and to send the signals to the computing device 212. The computing device 212 is adapted to construct an image of the object 208 based on the signals received from the segmented photodetector 210. Each ceramic scintillator body comprises a polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material having a substantially cubic crystallographic structure. The polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material has a chemical composition represented by a general formula Lu(2-x)GdxO3:Ac, where Ac is an activator. The value of x is greater than 0 and less than 2. For instance, the value of x can be greater than zero and less than or equal to one, such as in the chemical composition represented by the general formula LuGdO3:Ac. Alternatively, the value of x can be greater than 1 and less than 2, such as in the chemical composition represented by the general formula Lu0.5Gd1.5O3:Ac. The activator, Ac, can include a rare earth element, such as a lanthanide element. For example, the activator can include cerium, europium, praseodymium, samarium, terbium, or ytterbium. In an illustrative embodiment, the activator comprises less than or equal to approximately ten percent (10%) of the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material based on molar percentage, such as less than or equal to approximately five percent (5%) or less than or equal to approximately two percent (2%) of the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material based on molar percentage. In another embodiment, the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material can include a co-dopant, such as an aliovalent cation. In one example, the co-dopant can be a divalent cation, such as calcium. In another example, the co-dopant can be a quatrovalent cation, such as zirconium. In yet another example, the co-dopant can include a rare earth element that is different from the activator, such as cerium, terbium, praseodymium, europium, or any combination thereof. In an illustrative embodiment, the activator and co-dopant can collectively comprise less than or equal to approximately ten percent (10%) of the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material based on molar percentage, such as less than or equal to approximately five percent (5%) or less than or equal to approximately two percent (2%) of the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material based on molar percentage. For instance, the co-dopant can comprise less than or equal to approximately five percent (5%) of the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material based on molar percentage. In an illustrative embodiment, the polycrystalline scintillating material can be characterized by a grain size of from approximately 1 μm to approximately 100 μm. Additionally, each ceramic scintillator body can also be characterized by a density of greater than 98%, such as greater than or equal to 99.9%, of theoretical density. Further, each ceramic scintillator body can be characterized by an optical transmittance of greater than fifty percent (50%) total transmission at a scintillator body thickness that stops greater than 98% of x-ray or other radiation at a wavelength of maximum emission. In addition, each ceramic scintillator body can be characterized by a decay time of less than 1 ms. Each ceramic scintillator body can also be characterized by a high stopping power, such as with an atomic number (eff Z) of greater than approximately 62. FIG. 3 is a graph 300 illustrating emission intensity versus emission wavelength with respect to a lutetium gadolinium oxide (LuGdO3) scintillating material. The polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material includes europium as an activator in a proportion of two percent (2%). The graph 300 shows emission intensity at various wavelengths using an excitation wavelength of 266 nm with a gate delay of 10 ns and a gate width of 50 ns. FIG. 4 is a graph 400 illustrating emission intensity versus emission wavelength with respect to a lutetium oxide (Lu2O3) scintillating material also doped with europium as an activator in a proportion of two percent (2%). The graph 400 also shows emission intensity at various wavelengths using an excitation wavelength of 266 nm with a gate delay of 10 ns and a gate width of 50 ns. The graph 300 illustrates that LuGdO3 is characterized by significantly greater emission intensity than that of Lu2O3, shown in FIG. 3. For example, LuGdO3 exhibits an average emission intensity of greater than or equal to 40,000 ph/MeV at emission wavelengths of from approximately 410 nm to approximately 620 nm, with a maximum emission peak at 610 nm. Whereas, as illustrated in FIG. 4, scintillating material including Lu2O3 exhibits an average emission intensity of less than approximately 30,000 ph/MeV at emission wavelengths of from approximately 410 nm to approximately 620 nm. FIG. 5 illustrates a method of producing a ceramic scintillator body. At block 500, a precipitant solution of ammonium hydroxide and ammonium bicarbonate is prepared. Moving to block 502, a precursor solution of lutetium nitrate, gadolinium nitrate, an activator (Ac) nitrate precursor, and a co-dopant nitrate precursor, is prepared. Proceeding to block 504, the precursor solution is titrated into the precipitant solution to form a precipitate. Continuing to block 506, the precipitate is filtered and washed, and a precipitate wet cake is obtained. For example, the precipitate can be washed using deionized water until a desired conductivity value of residual ions is reached. In another example, the precipitate can also be washed with ethanol to prevent agglomeration during drying. Advancing to block 508, the precipitate wet cake is dried to obtain a precipitate dry cake. At block 510, the precipitate dry cake is calcined to obtain a polycrystalline ceramic scintillating powder having a composition represented by the general formula Lu(2-x)GdxO3:Ac (where x is less than two and greater than zero) and including a co-dopant. Moving to block 512, the calcined powder can be formed into ceramic scintillator bodies by first die pressing the powder into pellets and then cold isostatic pressing the pellets. Proceeding to block 514, the pressed pellets are sintered to obtain sintered samples, and each sample is hot isostatic pressed. Advancing to block 516, in a particular embodiment, each sample is air annealed to improve transparency. The method terminates at 518. EXAMPLE In one example, a precipitant solution of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) and ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) was prepared by adding 3M NH4OH and 1M NH4HCO3 to a beaker and mixing to form a uniform complex precipitant solution, diluted to approximately 500 ml. Next, a solution of precursors was prepared by mixing 60 ml Lu(NO3)3 (0.87M), 42.44 ml Gd(NO3)3 (1.23M), 16.04 ml Eu(NO3)3 (0.49M), 9.56 μl Pr(NO3)3 (1.13M), diluted to 1.5 . The precursor solution was titrated into the precipitant solution to form a precipitate. The precipitate was filtered from solution and washed with deionized water and Ethanol to produce a precipitate wet cake. The precipitate wet cake was dried in an oven at approximately 60° C., and the dried cake was calcined at 850° C. for 2 hrs in order to form a scintillating material having a composition of LuGdO3 with 7% Eu and 100 ppm Pr3+. The amount of co-dopant precursor used in the above example can be altered to vary the amount of co-dopant in the composition of the scintillating material, as shown in TABLE 1, below. TABLE 1 DESIRED CO-DOPANT AMOUNT PRE-CURSOR AMOUNT 1000 ppm Pr 95.6 μl Pr(NO3)3 (1.13M) 100 ppm Tb 17.4 μl Tb(NO3)3 (0.62M) 100 ppm Ce 20.54 μl Ce(NO3)3 (0.526M) 100 ppm Ca 20.6 μl Ca(NO3)2 (0.524M) The calcined powder was formed into ceramic scintillator bodies, by die pressing the powder into approximately 12 mm diameter pellets and then cold isostatic pressing the pellets to 30 ksi (2.07×108 Pa). The pressed pellets were then sintered in air at 1550° C. for 3 hrs. Each sintered sample was then hot isostatic pressed at 1500° C. for 1 hr in Argon at 30 ksi to produce a ceramic scintillator body. It is found that characteristics of the powder scintillating material can affect density and transparency of the resulting scintillator body. Some prior methods aim to produce powders having a uniform distribution of extremely small particles one the order of 1-5 nm in diameter, while other prior methods mix large (e.g., greater than 500 nm) and small (1-5 nm) sizes to attempt to fill any gaps between particles. However, it is found that a powder having substantially spherical particles between 10 nm and 500 nm, with a narrow particle size distribution is advantageous. For instance, a powder scintillating material having substantially spherical particles, where at least ninety percent of the particles have a size between approximately 50 nm and approximately 250 nm, such as approximately 66 nm to approximately 220 nm, can be used to produce a scintillator body having increased density and transparency. In accordance with the embodiments described herein, a ceramic scintillator body is disclosed that includes a polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material having a cubic crystallographic structure and having a chemical composition represented by a general formula Lu(2-x)GdxO3:Ac, where x is greater than zero and less than two and where Ac is an activator. While some rare earth oxides, such as lutetium oxide, can make effective scintillating materials, the cost of lutetium can produce a barrier to commercialization of lutetium oxide scintillators. It is found that the addition of gadolinium can significantly reduce the cost of scintillating material, while maintaining a substantially cubic crystallographic structure and causing only slight reductions in radiation stopping power when compared with lutetium oxide. In addition, it is found that lutetium gadolinium oxide doped with a rare earth activator such as europium exhibits a significantly higher emission intensity over emission wavelengths from approximately 410 nm to 620 nm, as illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4. In a particular embodiment, the polycrystalline ceramic scintillating material includes a co-dopant. While some rare earth activators, such as europium, can contribute to high scintillator efficiency, they may also produce a long afterglow in medical imaging applications as scintillation light lingers after a radiation source is deactivated. Afterglow is often caused by electron traps in scintillating material and can be reduced by adding certain elements. It is found that two approaches can reduce afterglow due to electron traps in lutetium gadolinium oxide. In one embodiment, electron traps caused by oxygen-related defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies or interstitial oxygen ions) in lutetium gadolinium oxide can be reduced by introducing aliovalent ions. It is found that calcium and zirconium are effective due to the closeness of their ionic radii to the ionic radii of lutetium and gadolinium. In another embodiment, it is found that afterglow can be reduced by introducing more favorable electron traps that do not contribute to afterglow by later releasing trapped electrons. For instance, the addition of rare earth co-dopants, such as praseodymium, cerium or terbium can create favorable electron traps that do not release trapped electrons or that cause non-radiative decay of trapped electrons. Hence, the scintillator efficiency of activators, such as europium, can be realized while afterglow is reduced. For example, a scintillator body produced from Lu(2-x)GdxO3:Eu (where x is greater than zero and less than two) and containing a co-dopant of calcium, cerium, praseodymium, terbium or zirconium, can be characterized by an afterglow of less than or equal to approximately 0.01% at 100 ms. TABLE 2, below, includes illustrative examples of scintillating material compositions having approximately 7% percent of europium based on molar percentage, and a co-dopant listed in ppm.
