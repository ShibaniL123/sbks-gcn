This statement is included solely to comply with 37 C..F.R. § 4 1 .1 (a){f)(4) and should not be taken as an assertion or admission that the application discloses and/or claims only one invention, Baekgrotrnd of ti^ Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common type of non-small cell lung cancer and the second leading cause of lung cancer related-death, causing approximately 400,000 deaths per year worldwide (Cancer Genome Arias Research (2012) Nature 489:519-525; Siegei e/ a . (2013) CA Cancer J. Cite. 63:1 1 -30). Unlike lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), for which man relevant oncogenic mutations have been defined and used to develop strategies for targeted therapies, the genomic landscape of lung SCC is only now emerging. There are not yet any approved targeted therapies for lung SCC. Unfortunately, therapeutic targets in lung ADC, such as EGFR and EML4-ALK, do not appear to play major roles in lung SCC (Rekhttnati el «/. (2 12) Clin. Cancer Res. 18: 1 167- 1 176). This fact underscores the need to develop a preclinical model of lung squamous cell carcinoma in which to define and test novel therapeutic approaches. Currently, the field lacks a mouse model in which introduction of genetic alterations found in human squamous lung cancers leads to tumors of purely squamous phenoiype. Simultaneous activation of Kras^1^3 (Kras) and inactivation oiLkhl (also known as serine- threonine kinase 1 1 , SiklJ) gives rise to multiple lung cancer histologies, including squamous cell carcinomas (Ji el al. (2007) Nature 448:807-810); however, KMAS mutations are very rarely found in human squamous lung tumors. Recently, it was reported that kinase-dead Ikk knock-in mice developed spontaneous lung squamous cell carcinomas characterized by !kk down-regulation and marked pulmonary inflammation (Xiao el. ai. (20.13) Cancer Cell 23:527-540). Significant down-reguiation ΟΪΪΜ1 was found in Ikk A KA lung SCCs and adjacent lung tissues as compared to wild-type lungs. Deletion oi'Lkhl alone is unable to drive rumor formation (Ji et al. (2007) Nature 448; 807-81 ). PTBN (Phosphatase and tensin homolog) is another commonly mutated, deleted, or epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor in human lung cancers (Salmena et ai (2008) Cell 133:403-414). PTEN k altered in 1 5% of human SCCs (Cancer Genome Atlas Research (2012) Nature 489: 519-525). PTEN negatively regulates the PI3K/A T pathway and PI3 pathway gene alterations are found in more than half of human lung SCCs (Cancer Genome Atlas Research (2012) Nature 489:519-525). In the mouse model, Pten deletion alone in airway basal cells can initiate lung tumor formation, but with low tumor incidence, long latency, and mixed ADC and. SCC phenotypc (Maikoski et al (2013) Mol Car nog, (e-pub) do : 10. l002/mc/22G30). One key feature of tumor development that autochthonous genetically engineered mouse models provide is a physiologically relevant tumor ttneroenvironment All of the models of lun SCC to date, including the Ma knock-in. mice and a model driven by chronic tuberculosis infection, show marked pulmonary inflammation ( alhandian et ai. (2009) Oncogene 28:1 28-1938; Xiao et al (2 13) Cancer Cell 23:527-540), suggesting that an inilammatory microenvironment is central to the development of lung SCCs. This is not surprising given that nearly all humans with lung SCCs have a history of tobacco use that drives squamous metaplasia and the development of SCCs is associated with inflammatory diseases and chronic immunosuppression. Both tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) comprise significant proportions of the inflammatory infiltrates in a wide variety of mouse tumor models and human cancers (Murdoch et al. (2008) Na Rev. Cancer 8:618-631 ). Neutrophils were shown to predominate in human head neck squamous carcinomas (Trcilakis et al. (201 ) Int. J. Cancer 129:2183-2193), Neutrophils found in mouse tumors are plienorypica!ly characterized as polymorphonuclear CD ! .lb':Ly6GT cells, and may be related to a subtype of myeloid deri ved suppressive cells (MDSCs). MDSCs encompass a heterogeneous population of myeloid cells, which share the ability to suppress T cel ls through the production of arginase, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and other mechanisms (Dumitru et al. (2012) Cancer Immunol Immimoiher. 61 : 1 155- 1167). In the tumor microenvironraent, accumulated MDSCs are thought to promote tumor progression through enhancing matrix degradation, tunior ceil proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis (Welch ei al. (1 89) Proc. Mat!. Acad Sci. USA. 86:5859-5863). MDSCs have also been shown to antagonize effector T cell function, support the generation of immunosuppressive T cell populations and inhibit the lysis of tumor ceils by cytotoxic T cells or NK. cells (Dumitru e( al. (2012) Cancer Immunol. Immimoiher. 61 : 1155-1 167). Some MDSCs have neutrophilic features, but the precise relationship between these cells and normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes remains under active investigation. Polymorphonuclear cells infiltrating lung cancers are referred to herein as TA s. Tumors can also evade immune surveillance by expressing molecules that maintain immune tolerance in peripheral tissues, such as Pd-ligand-i (PD-Li). which interacts with the immune receptor Programmed ceil death- i (PDCD1 or PD-l) (Barber et al. (2006) Nature 439:682-687). The PD- l/PD-LJ interaction inhibits CD f cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) proliferation, survival and effector function, and can induce apoptosis of tumor- infiiiraiing T ceils (Barber et al (2006) Nature 439:682-687). PD- 1 /PD-L 1 interactions can aiso promote the differentiation of CDC T cells into FOXP3r Tregs {Francisco et al (2009) J. Exp, Med, 206:3015-3029), which are known to further suppress the immune system and cause peripheral immune tolerance in lung cancer patients (Adeegbe and Nishikawa (2013) Front. Immunol 4: 1 0). Ectopic PD-LI expression in tumor cells in a syngeneic transplant model facilitated the escape of the tumor cells from CTL control (Iwai et al. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Set. U.S.A. 99:12293- 12297). Consistent with these findings in pre-elinieal systems, infusing lung cancer patients with blocking anti-PD- 1/PDL-l monoclonal antibodies has shown efficacy in early stage trials, despite limited activity of prior immunotherapies for lung malignancies (Brahmer et al (2012) N. Engl J. Med. 366:2455- 2465; Topalian el el (2012) N. Engl J. Med. 366:2443-2454). Tumor- ropagating cells have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into the bulk population of the tumor and are thought to drive both disease recurrence and metastatic spread (Visvader and Lindeman (2012) Cell Stem Cell 10:717-728), Stem cell antigen- i (S al or Ly6a) was reported as a bronchioalveolar stem cell (BASC) marker in the distal lung and is also enriched in bronehiolar progenitor cells (Ki et al (2005) Cell 121 :823-835; Lee et l. (2014) Cell 156:440-455.). SC T cells, located at the bronchioalveolar duct junction (BADJ), are hyper-proliferative in response to both oncogenic Kras and deletion of P fen, suggesting that the are susceptible to neoplastic transformation (Kim el al (2005) Ceil 121:823-835; Tiozzo el al. (2009) Am. J. Respir, Crit. Care Med. 180:7 1-712). In addition, SCA 1 can he used to enrich for Junior propagating cells (TPCs) in the lung den carcinonmJ^m^'^"' ^^ (Kras;p53) mode! (Curtis ei al (2010) Ceil Stem Cell 7: 1 27-133). In the more proximal lung, nerve growth factor receptor (TNFR superfamily, member 6, Ngfr) is a stem cell marker for the pseudostratifted tracheal epithelium in both human and moose; NGFR expression is specifically observed in the p63 ' mouse basal stem cells (Rock et al. (2009) Pro . Nail. Acad. Set U.S.A. 106: 12771 -12775). NGFR''' basal cells appear to be the cel!s-of-origin in a SOX2-induced model of esophageal SCC, and NGFR has been suggested as a putative marker for huma esophageal SCC TPCs (Huang ei al. (2009) BMC Cancer 9:9; Liu ei al. (2013) Cell Stem Cell 12:304-315). Despite these clues as to the molecular phenotype of a potential rumor propagating cell in SCC, no TPC population able to propagate disease serially has been identified for lung SCC. Moreover, since therapies that negatively regulate immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-L anti-PD-L L and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, are bot significantly toxic in combination and very expensive, there is a great need in the art to identify hiomarkers which are predictive of patient responsiveness to such therapies in order to appropriatel determine an efficacious and cost-effective course of therapeutic intervention. S m er y. of the I n yetitian The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that the presence of activating oncogenes (e.g., activating KRAS, NRAS, and or HRAS mutations), the presence of inhibiting tumor suppressors (e.g., inhibiting Lkbi and/or Pten mutations), and the amount (e.g., copy number or level of expression) and/or activity of such hiomarkers, are predictive of h peφrø1iferat ve cell responsiveness to anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.

Detailed Descr ip tian of the In vention The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that bi-al!elic inactivation of the tumor suppressors, Lkbl and Fl n, in the lung causes lung tumors with a purely squamous ceil phenotype. These squamous lung rumors were 100% penetrant and recapitulated the genetic, molecular and microenvironmental aspects of the human disease. With this model, the molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of lung squamous tumors, including tumor propagating ceils, microenvironmental factors, immune tolerance, and therapeutic targets were identified. For example, Lkb];Pter anxl\ (LP) tumors expressed the squamous markers KRT5, p63 and SOX2, and transcriptionally resembled the basal subtype of human SCC. In contrast to mouse adenocarcinomas, the LP tumors contained immune populations enriched for tumor-associated neutrophils, SCAi 'MGFR' fractions were enriched for tumor propagating cells (IPCs.) that could serially transplant the disease in orthotopic assays. TPCs in the LP model and NGF.R* cells in huma SCCs highly expressed PD-L1 , suggesting a mechanism of immune escape for TPCs. Accordingly, the present invention relates, in part, to methods for predicting response of a cancer in a subjec t to anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy based upon a determination and analy sis of specific biomarkcrs, such as the presence of activating oncogenes (e.g., activating K.RAS, NRAS, and/or HRAS mutations), the presence of inhibiting tumor suppressors (e.g,, inhibiting Lkb l and/or Pten mutations), and the amount (e.g., copy number or level of expression) and/or activity of such biomarkcrs. In addition, such analyses cart be used in order to provide useful anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment regimens (e.g., based on predictions of subject survival or relapse, timing of adjuvant or neoadjuvant: treatment, etc.). 1. Definitions The. articles "a" and "an" are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e. to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, "an element" means one element or more than one element. The term "altered amount" or "altered level" refers to increased or decreased copy number (e.g., gerniline and/or somatic) of a biomarker nucleic acid, e.g., increased, or decreased expression level in a cancer sample, as compared to the expression level or copy number of the biomarker nucleic acid in a control sample. The term "altered amount" of a biomarker also includes an increased or decreased protein level of a biomarker protein or metabolite level of a biomarker metabolite, such as L-arginine or creatine, in a sample, e,g„ a cancer sample, as compared to the corresponding protein or metabolite level in a normal, control sample. Furthermore, an altered amount of a. biomarker protein may be determined by detecting posttraiislationai modification such as methylation status of the marker, which may affect the expression or acti vity of the biomarker protein. The amount of a biomarker in a subject is "significantly" higher or lower than the normal amount of the biomarker, if the amount of the biomarker is greater or less, respectively, than the normal level by an amount greater than the standard error of the assay employed to assess amount, and preferably at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 300%, 350%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900%, 1 00% or than that amount. Alternately, the amount of the biomarker in the subject can be considered "significantly" higher or lower than the normal amount if the amount is at least about two, and preferably at least about three, four, or five times, higher or lower, respectively, than the normal amount of the biomarker. Such "significance" can also be applied to any other measured parameter described herein, such as for expression, inhibition, cytotoxicity, ceil growth, and the like. The term "altered level of expression'' of a biomarker refers to an expression level or copy number of the biomarker in a test sample, e.g., a sample derived from a patient suffering from cancer, that is greater or less than the standard error of the assay employed to assess expression or copy number, and is preferably at least twice, and more preferably three, four, five or ten or more times the expression levei or copy number of the biomarker in a control sample (e.g., sample from a healthy subjects not having the associated disease) and preferably, the average expression level or copy number of the biomarker in several control samples. The altered level of expression is greater or less than the standard error of the assay employed to assess expression or copy number, and is preferably at least twice, and more preferably three, four, five or ten or more times the expression level or copy number of the biomarker in a control sample (e.g., sampie from a healthy subjects not having the associated disease) and preferably, the average expression level or copy number of the biomarker in several control samples. The term "altered activity'' of a biomarker refers to an activity of the biomarker which is increased or decreased in a disease state, e.g., in a cancer sample, as compared to the activity of the biomarker in a normal, control sample. Altered activity of the biomarker may be the result of. for example, altered expression of the biomarker, altered protein level of the biomarker, altered structure of the biomarker, or, e.g., an altered interaction with other proteins involved in the same or different pathway as the biomarker or altered interaction with transcriptional activators or inhibitors. The term "altered structure" of a biomarker refers to the presence of mutation or allelic variants within a biomarker nucleic acid or protein, e.g., mutations which affect expression or activ ity of the biomarker nucleic acid or protein, as compared to the normal or wild-type gene or protein. For example, mutations include, but are not limited to substitutions, deletions, or addition mutations. Mutations may be present in the coding or non-coding region of t he biomarker nucleic actd. "Unless otherwise specified here within, the terms "antibody" and "antibodies" broadly encompass naftiraily-oecurring forms of antibodies (e.g. IgG, igA, gM, IgE) and recombinant an tibodies such as single-chain antibodies, chimeric and humanized antibodies and multi-specific antibodies, as well as fragments and derivati ves of all of the foregoing, which fragments and derivatives have at least an antigenic binding site. Antibody derivatives may comprise a protein or chemical moiety conjugated to an antibody. The term "antibody" as used herein also includes an "antigen-binding portion'* of an antibody (or simply ' antibody portion"). The term "antigen-binding portion", as used herein, refers to one or more fragments of an antibod that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., a biomarker polypeptide, fragment thereof, or biomarker metabolite). It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. .Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH,, CL and CHI domains; (ii) a F(ab')2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CHI domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward ef al,> (1989) Nature 341 :544-546), which consists of a VH domain; and. (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CD ). furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment,. VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, the can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent polypeptides (known as single chain Fv (seFv); see e.g.. Bird ei al. ( 1 88) Science 242:423-426; and Huston ei al. ( 1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Set. USA 85:5879-5883; arid Osboura et ί 1 98, Nature Biotechnology 16: 778). Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody. A ny VH and VL sequences of specific- seFv can be linked to hitman immunoglobulin constant region c-DNA or genomic sequences, in order to generate expression vectors encoding complete- IgG polypeptides or other tsotypes. VH and VL can also be used in the generation of Fab, Fv or other fragments of immunoglobulins using either protein chemistry or recombinant DNA technology. Other forms of single chain an tibodies, such as diabodies are also encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent, bispeeifie antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see e.£, Hollig«r, P., et al. ( 1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Set. USA 90:6444-6448; Poijak, R. J., et ol ( 1 94) Structure 2:1121- 1 123). Still further, an antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof may be part of larger immunoadhesion polypeptides,, formed by covalent or noncovalent association of the antibody or antibody portion with one or more other proteins or peptides. Examples of such itnmunoadhesion polypeptides include use of the streptavidin core region to make a tetrameric scFv polypeptide (Kipriyanov, S.M., et al. ( 1 95) Human Antibodies and Hybridomas 6:93-101) and use of a cysteine residue, btomarker peptide and a C-terminal polyhistidme tag to make bivalent and biotinylated scFv polypeptides (Kipriyanov, S.M., et al. (1994) MoL Immunol. 31 : 1047- 1058). Antibody portions, such as Fab and P(ab')2 fragments, can be prepared from whole antibodies using conventional techniques, such as papain or pepsin digestion, respectively, of whole antibodies. Moreover, antibodies, antibody portions and immunoadhesion polypeptides can be obtained, using standard recombinant DNA techniques, a described herein. Antibodies ma be polyclonal or monoclonal; xenogeneic, allogeneic, or syngeneic; or modified forms there f (e.g. humanized, chimeric- etc.). Antibodies may also be folly human. Preferably, antibodies of the invention bind specifically or substantially specifically to a biomarker polypeptide or fragment thereof The terms "monoclonal antibodies" and "monoclonal antibody composition,' ' as used herein, refer to a population of antibody polypeptides that contain only one species of an antigen binding site capable of immunoreacting with a -particular epitope of an antigen, whereas the term "polyclonal antibodies" and "polyclonal antibody composition" refer to a population of antibody polypeptides that contain multiple species of antigen binding sites capable of interacting with a particular antigen. A monoclonal antibody composition typically displays a single binding affinity for particular antigen with which it immitnoreacts. Antibodies may a! so be "humanked", which is intended to include antibodies made by a non-human cell having variable and constant regions which have been altered to more closely resemble antibodies that would be made by a human cell. For example, by altering the non-human antibody amino acid sequence to incorporate amino acids found in human genniine immunoglobulin sequences. The humanized antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germiine immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesi in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDfts. The term "humanized antibody", as used herein, also includes antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the genniine of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences. The term "assigned score'' refers to the numerical value designated, for each of the bio markers after being measured in a patient sample. The assigned score correlates to the absence, presence or inferred amount of the iomarker in die sample. The assigned score can be generated manually (e.g. , by visual inspection) or with the aid of instrumentation for image acquisition and analysts, in certain embodiments, the assigned score is determined by a qualitative assessment, for example, detection of a fluorescent readout on a graded scale, or quantitative assessment. In one embodiment, an "aggregate score,'' which refers to the combination of assigned scores from a plurality of measured biomarkers, is determined. In one embodiment the aggregate score is a summation of assigned scores, in another embodiment, combination of assigned scores involves performing mathematical operations on the assigned scores before combining them into an aggregate score. In certain, embodiments, the aggregate score is also referred to herein as the predictive score." The term "biomarker" refers to a measurable entity of the present invention that has been determined to be predictive of anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy effects on a cancer. Biomarkers cars include, without limitation, nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites, particularly those relating to oncogene biomarkers (e.g., activating mutations in oncogene biomarkers) and tumor suppressor biomarkers (e.g., inhibiting mutations in tumor suppressors) as shown in Table 1. A "blocking" antibody or an antibody "antagonist" is one which inhibits or reduces at least one biological activity of the anttgen(s) it binds. In certain embodiments, the blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies or fragments thereof described herein substantially or completely inhibit a given biological acti vity of the antigen(s). The term "body fluid" refers to fluids that are excreted or secreted from the body as well as fluid that are normally not (e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, amniotic fluid, aqueous humor, bile, blood and blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, cerumen and earwax, cowper's fluid or pre-ejaeu!atory fluid, chyle, chyme, stool female ejaculate, interstitial fluid, intracellular fluid, lymph, menses, breast milk, mucus, pleura! fluid, pus, saliva, sebum, semen, serum, sweat, synovial fluid, tears, urine, vaginal lubrication, vitreous humor, vomit). The terms "cancer" or 'Tumor" or "hyperproliferative" refer to the presence of cells possessing characteristics typical of cancer-causing cells, such as uncontrolled proliferation, immortality, metastatic potential, rapid growth and proliferation rate, and certain characteristic morphological features. In some embodiments, such cells exhibit such characteristics in part or in full due to the expression and activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-'i , PD-L1 , PD-L2, and/or CTLA-4. Cancer cells are often in the form of a tumor, but such cells may exist alone within an animal, or may be a non~ tumorigenic cancer ceil, such as a leukemia cell.

In some embodiments, cancers are epitMelial in nature and include but are not limited to, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, gynecologic cancers, renal cancer, laryngeal cancer, lung cancer, oral cancer, head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, or skin cancer, in other embodiments, the cancer is breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, or colon cancer. In still other embodiments, the epithelial cancer is non-sroa!!-eeh lung cancer, nonpapiliary renal cell carcinoma, cervicai carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma (e.g., serous ovarian carcinoma), or breast carcinoma. The epithelial cancers may be characterized in various other ways including, but not limited to, serous, endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell, Brenner, or undifferentiated. in some embodiments, long cancer subtypes are included. For example, according to the American Cancer Society, there are two major types of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small ceil lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC comprises about 15% of all cancers. NSCLC, however, comprises about 85% of all lung cancers and is di vided into three distinct sub-types: squamous cell carcinoma (about 25-30% of the cases), large cell carcinomas (about 10-15%), and adenocarcinomas (about 40%). The cells in these subtypes differ in size, shape, and chemical make-up. These lung cancers are inclusive of bronchogenic carcinoma, bronchial carcinoids, chondroraatous hamartoma, solitary pulmonary nodules, pulmonary sarcomas, undifferentiated small cell carcinoma, undifferentiated large cell carcinoma, and broneholoalveolar carcinomas. Each such Sung cancer subtype is contemplated for use according to the present invention, either alone or in any combination. The term "coding region" refers to regions of a nucleotide sequence comprising codons which are translated into amino acid residues, whereas the term "noncoding region'' refers to regions of a nucleotide sequence that are not translated into amino acids (e.g., 5' and 3' untranslated regions). The term "complementary" refers to the broad concept of sequence complementarity between regions of two nucleic acid strands or between two regions of the same nucleic acid strand. It is known that an adenine residue of a first nucleic acid region is capable of forming specific hydrogen bonds ("base pairing") with a residue of a second nucleic acid region which is antiparallei to the first region if the residue is thymine or uracil Similarly, it is known that a cytosiiie residue of a first nucleic acid strand is capable of base pairing with a residue of a second nucleic acid strand which is antiparaliei to the first strand if the residue is guanine. A first region of a nucleic acid is complementary to a second region of the same or a different nucleic acid if, when the two regions are arranged iii an antiparaliei fashion, at least one nucleotide residue of the first region is capable of base pairing with a residue of the second region. Preferably, the first region comprises a first portion and the second region comprises a second portion, whereby, when the first and second portions are arranged in an antiparaliei fashion, at least about 50%, and preferably at !east about 75%, at !east about 90%, or at least about 95% of the nucleotide residues of the first portion are capable of base pairing with nucleotide residues in the second portion. More preferably, all nucleotide residues of the first portion are capable of base pairing with nucleotide residues in the second portion. The term "control" refers to any reference standard suitable to provide a comparison to the expression products in the test sample, in one embodiment, the control comprises obtaining a "control sample*" from which expression product levels are detected and compared to the expression product levels from the test sample. Such a control sample may comprise any suitable sample, including but not limited to a sample from a control cancer patient (can he stored sample or previous sample measurement) with a known outcome; normal tissue or cells isolated from a subject, such as a normal patient or the cancer patient, cultured primary cells/tissues isolated from a subject such as a normal subject or the cancer patient, adjacent normal cells/tissues obtained from the same organ or body location of the cancer patient, a tissue or cell sample isolated from a normal subject, or a primary cells/tissues obtained from a depository. In another preferred embodiment, the control ma comprise a reference standard expression product level from any suitable source, including but not limited to housekeeping genes, an expression product level range from normal tissue (or other previously analyzed control sample), a previously determined expression product level range within a test sample from a group of patients, or a set of patients with a certain outcome (for example, survi val for one, two, three, four years, etc) or receiving a certain treatment (for example, standard of care cancer therapy). It will be understood by those of skill in the art that such control samples and reference standard expression product levels can be used in combination as controls in the methods of the present invention. In one embodiment, the control may comprise normal or non-cancerous cell/tissue sample, in another preferred embodiment, the control may comprise an expression level for a set of patients, such as a set of cancer patients, or for a set of cancer patients receiving a certain treatment, or for a set of patients with one outcome versus another outcome. In the former ease, the specific expression product level of each patient can be assigned to a percentile level of expression, or expressed as either higher or lower than the mean or average of the reference standard expression level In another preferred embodiment, the control ma comprise norma! cells, ceils from patients treated with combination chemo therapy, and cells from patients having benign cancer. In another embodiment, the control may also comprise a measured value for example, average level of expression of a particular gene in a population compared to the level of expression of a housekeeping gene in the same population. Such a population may comprise normal subjects, cancer patients who have not undergone any treatment (i.e., treatment naive), cancer patients undergoing standard of care therapy, or patients having benign cancer, in another preferred embodiment, the control comprises a ratio transformation of expression product levels, including bitt not limited to determining a ratio of expression product levels of two genes in the test sample and comparing it to any suitable ratio of the same two genes in a reference standard; determining expression product levels of the two or more genes in the test sample and determining a difference in expression product le vels i any suitable control; and determining expression product levels of the two or more genes in the test sample, normalizing their expression to expression of housekeeping genes in the test sample, and comparing to any suitable control in particularly preferred embodiments, the control comprises a control sample which is of the same lineage and/or ty pe as the test sample. In another embodiment, the control may comprise expression product levels grouped as percentiles within or based on a set of patient samples, such as all patients with cancer, in one embodiment a control expression product level is established wherein higher or lower levels of expression product relative to, for instance, a particular percentile, are used as the basis for predicting outcome, in another preferred embodiment, a control expression product level is established using expression product levels from cancer control patients with a known outcome, and the expression product levels from, the test sample are compared to the control expression product level as the basis for predicting outcome. As demonstrated by the data below, the methods of the invention are not limited to use of a specific cut-point in comparing the level of expression product in the test sample to the control. The ''copy number" of a biomarker nucleic acid refers to the number of DNA sequences in a cell (e.g., germline and/or somatic) encoding a particular gene product. Generally, for a given gene, a mammal has two copies of each gene. The copy number can be increased, however, by gene amplification or duplication, or reduced by deletion. For example, germline copy number changes include changes at one or more genomic loci, wherein said one or more genomic loci are not accoutited for by the number of copies in tit' normal complement of germline copies in a control ( -. e.. the normal copy number in germline DNA for the same species as that from which the specific germline DNA and corresponding copy number were determined). Somatic copy .number changes include changes at one or more genomic loci, wherein said one or more genomic loci are not accounted for by the number of copies in germline DNA of a control (e.g., copy number in germline DNA for the same subject as that from which the somatic DNA and correspondin copy number were determined). The "normal" copy number (e.g.t germline and/or somatic ) of a biomarker nucleic acid or "normal" level of expression of a biomarker nucleic acid, protein, or metabolite is the activity/le vel of expression or copy number in a biological sample, e.g., a sample containing tissue, whole blood, serum, plasma, buccal scrape, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, stool, and bone marrow, from a subject, e.g., a human, not afflicted with cancer, or from a corresponding non-cancerous tissue in the same subject who has cancer. The term: "determining a suitable treatment regimen for the subject" is taken to mean the determination of a treatment regimes (i.e. , a single therapy or a combination of different therapies that are used for the prevention and/or trea tment of the cancer in the subject) for a subject that is started, modified and/or ended based or essentially based or at least partially based on the results of the analysis according to the present invention. One example is determining whether to provide targeted therapy against a cancer to provide immunotherapy that generally increases immune responses against the cancer (e.g., anti- immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy). Another example is starting an adjuvant therapy after surgery whose purpose is to decrease the risk of recurrence, another would be to modify the dosage of a particular chemotherapy. The determination can, in addition to the results of the analysis according to the present invention, be based on personal characteristics of the subject to be treated. In most cases, the actual determination of the suitable treatment regimen for the subject will be performed by the attending physician or doctor. A molecule is "fixed" or "affixed" to a substrate if u is covalently or non-eovalently associated with the sitbsirate such that the substrate can be rinsed with a fluid (e.g. standard saline citrate, pH 7,4) without a substantial fraction of the molecule dissociating from the substrate. The term: "expression signature" or "signature" refer to a group of two or more eoordinately expressed biomarkers. For example, the genes, proteins, metabolites, and the like making up this signature may be expressed in a specific cell lineage, stage of differentiation, or during a particular biologicai response. The biomarkers can reflect biologicai aspects of the tu mors in which they are expressed, such as the cell of origin of the cancer, the nature of the non-mali nant ceils in the biopsy, and the oncogenic mechanisms responsible for the cancer. Expression dat and gene expression levels can be stored on computer readable media, e.g., the computer readable medium used in conjunction with a tmcroarray or chip reading device. Such expression data can be manipulated to generate expression signatures. "Homologous" as used herein, refers to nucleotide sequence similarity' between two regions of the same nucleic acid strand or between regions of two different nucleic acid strands. When a nucleotide residue position in both regions is occupied by the same nucleotide residue, then the regions are homologous at that position. A first region is homologous to a second reaion if at least one nucleotide residue position of each resion is occupied b the same residue . Homology between two regions is expressed in terras of the proportion of nucleotide residue positions of the two regions that are occupied by the same nucleotide residue. By way of example, a region having the nucleotide sequence 5'- ATTGCC-3' and a region having the nucleotide sequence 5'-TATGGC-3' share 50% homology. Preferably, the first region comprises a first portion and the second region comprises a second portion, whereby, at least about 50%, and preferably at least about 75%, at least about 90%, or at least about 95% of the nucleotide residue positions of each of the portions are occupied by the same nucleotide residue. More preferably, all nucleotide residue positions of each of the portions are occupied by the same nucleotide residue. The term "immune cell" refers to ceils that play a role in the immune response. Immune cells are of hematopoietic origin, and include lymphocytes, such as B cells and T. cells; natural killer cells; myeloid cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and granulocytes. The ter 'immune checkpoint inhibitor*' mean a group of molecules on the cell surface of CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells that fine-tune immune responses by down- modulating or inhibiting an anti-tumor immune response, imiiiune checkpoint proteins are well known in the art and include, without limitation, CTLA-4, P -i, VISTA, B7-H2, B7- H3, PD-L l , B7-B4, 87-H6, 2B4, ICOS, KVEM, PD-L2, CD1 0, gp49B, PIR-B, KLR family receptors, TiM-S , TL -3, l M-4, LAG-3, BTLA, SiRPaipha (CD47), CD48, 284 CCD244), B7. t , B7.2, 1LT-2, ILT-4, TfGfT, and A2aR (see, for example, WO 2 1,2/177624). "Anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy" refers to the use of agents that inhibit immune checkpoint inhibitors. Inhibition of one or more immune checkpoint inhibitors can block or otherwise neutralize inhibitory signaling to thereby upregulate an immune response in order to more efficaciously treat cancer. Exemplary agents useful for inhibiting immune checkpoint inhibitors include antibodies, small molecules, peptides, pepttdomimettes, natural Hgands, and derivati ves of natural Hgands, that can either bind and/or inactivate or inhibit immune checkpoint proteins, or fragments thereof; as well as UNA interference, antisense, nucleic acid aptamers, etc. that can downregulate the expression and/or activity of immune checkpoint inhibitor nucleic acids, or fragments thereof. Exemplary agents for upregulating an immune response include antibodies against one or more immune checkpoint inhibitor proteins block the interaction between the proteins and its natural reeeptor(s); a non-activating form of one or more immune checkpoint inhibitor proteins (e.g., a dominant negative polypeptide); small molecules or peptides that block the interaction between one or more immune checkpoint inhibitor proteins and its natural receptoris); fusion proteins (e.g. the extracellular portion of an immune checkpoint inhibition protein fused to the Fc portion of an antibody or immunoglobulin) that bind to its natural receptor(s); nucleic acid molecules that block immune checkpoint inhibitor nucleic acid transcription or translation; and the like. Such agents can directly block the interaction between the one or more immune checkpoint inhibitors and its natural receptor(s) (e.g., antibodies) to prevent inhibitory signaling and upregulate an immune response. Alternatively, agents can indirectly block the interaction between one or more immune checkpoint proteins and its natural reeeptorfs) to prevent inhibitory signaling and upregulate an immune response. For example, a soluble version of an immune checkpoint protein ligand- such as a stabilized extracellular domain can binding to its receptor to indirectly reduce the effective concentration of the receptor to bind to an appropriate ligand. in one embodiment, anti-PD-l antibodies, anti-PD-Ll antibodies, and anti-CT.LA-4 antibodies,, either alone or in combination or in combination with anti-ARG l therapeutics described below, arc used to inhibit- immune checkpoint inhibitors. in some embodiments, arginase 1 (ARG1 ) is included within the definition of "immune checkpoint inhibitor" by virtue of the fact that it has immunomhibitory functions. The term "arginase I" refers to a manganese-containing enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of arginme and water to ornithine and urea. At least two isoforms of mammalian arginase exist (types I and 11), which differ in their tissue disiribution, subcellular localization, immunologic crossreaciivity and physiologic function. The type 1 isoform encoded by this gene, is a cytosoHc enzyme and expressed predomi nantly in the liver as a component: of the urea cycle. Representative human ARG1 cD A and protein sequences are well-known in the art and are publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). For example, ARGI isoform 1 is available under accession numbers NM J)01244438, 1 and NPJX) 1231367.1 . ARGI isoform 2, available under accession numbers NM J)00045.3 and NPJXXXB6.2, uses an alternate in-frame splice site at the 5' end of an exon compared to variant 1 resulting in the same N- and C -termini, but is shorter i comparison to isofomi 1. Nucleic acid and polypeptide sequences of ARGI orthologs in organisms other than humans are well known and include, for example, mouse ARG I (NMJ>07842.3 and R 031508.1), chimpanzee ARGi (ΧΜ 0033 Π489.2 and XPJXB3.1 1537.1), monkey ARG I (XMJ)Ol 103609,2 and XPjtOl 103609.2), dog ARGi (XM J532053.4, ΧΡ_ 532053.3, XMJXB639427.2, and XPJX13639475..1 }f cow ARG I (NMJX) 1046154.1 and NPJ.K>1039619.1), rat ARG I (NMJH7B4.3 and NPJ>58830.2)« and zehrafish ARGI (NMJX) 1045197.1 and NPJX) 1038662.1). Representative ARG I sequences are presented below in Table 1. Anti-ARG l antibodies are well-known in the art and include, for example, 16001 - Ϊ-ΑΡ (Proieintech Group), AMAb90545 (Atlas Antibodies), and PA 1783 (Hosier immunoleader). In addition, other inhibitors of ARGI (e.g., small molecules) are known and include, for example, -hydroxy-L-arginine and 2(S)-arai.no-643oronohexonic acid (ABH). Moreover, assays for measuring ARGi amount, activity, and metabolites are well -known in the art (see, for example, U.S. Pat, Pitbi. 201 1 - 026348). it is to be noted that the term can further be used to refer to any combination of features described herein regarding ARG I molecules. For example, any combination of sequence composition, percentage identify, sequence length, domain structure, functional acti ity, etc. can be used to describe an ARGI molecule of the present invention. "PD-i" is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that refers to a member of the immunoglobulin gene superianiily that functions as a comhibitory receptor having PD-LI and PD-L2 as known iigan s. PD- 1 was previously identified using a subtraction cloning based approach to select for proteins involved in apoptotie cell death. PD-1 is a member of the CD28/CTLA-4 famil of molecules based on its ability to hind to PD-Li . Like CTLA- 4, PD-1 is rapidly induced on the surface of T-celis in response to anti-CD3 (Agate et at. 25 (1996) «/- Immunol. 8:765). In contrast to CTLA-4, however, PD-1 is also induced on the surface of 8-celis (in response to anti-igM). PD-1 is also expressed on a subset of thymocytes and myeloid cells (Agata et al (1 96) supro; Mishimura el al. ( 1996) Int. Immunol. 8:773), The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of a representati ve human PD-1 bioraarker is available to the public at the GenBank database under N _005018.2 and NP J>0S0G9.2 (see also Ishida et l. (1 92) 20 EM O J 1 1:3887; Shiaohara et al. (1994) Genomics 23:704; U.S. Patent 5,698,520). PD- l has an extracellular region containing immunoglobulin superfamify domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular region including an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (1 TIM) (ishida ei al. ( 1992) EMBOJ. I 1 :3887; S nohara et al. (1994) Genomics 23:704; and U.S. Patent 5,698,520). These features also define a larger family of polypeptides, called the immunoinhibitory receptors, which also includes gp49Bs PIR.-B, and the killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs) (Vivier and Da ron ( 1 97) Immunol. Toa'ay 18:286). It is often assumed that the tyros l phospiiory kited ΓΠΜ motif of these receptors interacts with SH2-domain containing phosphatases, which leads to inhibitory signals. A subset of these immunoinhibitory receptors bind to MHC polypeptides, for example the KIRs, and CTLA4 binds to B7-i and B7-2. It has been proposed that there is a phy!ogcoetic relationship between the MHC and B7 genes (Henry et l. ( 1999) Immunol. Today 20(6):285~8). Nucleic acid and polypeptide sequences of PD-1 orthologs in organisms other than humans are well known and include, for example, mouse PD-1 (NMJ0O8798.2 and NP_ 032824.1), rat PD- 1 ( M JXH 106927.1 and NP J>011 0397.1 ), dog PD- 1 (XM. 543338.3 and XP..543338.3), cow PD- 1 ( M j)01083506,.i and NIMXM076975.1), and chicken PD-1 (XM __422723.3 and XP _422723.2). PD-1 polypeptides are inhibitory receptors capable of transmitting an inhibitory signal to an immune cell to thereby inhibit immune cell effector function, or are capable of promoting costimulatioii (e.g., by competitive inhibition) of immune cells, e.g., when present is soluble, monomene form. Preferred PD-i family members share sequence identity with PD-i and bind to one or more B7 family members, e.g., B7-l f B7~2, PD-l ligand, and/or other polypeptides on antigen presenting cells. The term "PD-i activity" includes the ability of a PD- l polypeptide to modulate an inhibitory signal in an activated immune cell, e.g., by engaging a natural PD-i ligand on an antigen presenting cell, PD- i transmits an inhibitory signal to an immune cell- in a manner similar to CTLA4. Modulation of an inhibitory signal in an immune ceil results in modulation of proliferation of, and/or cytokine secretion by, an immune cell. Thus, the term "PD- l activity" includes the ability of a PD- l polypeptide to bind its natural ligand(s), the ability to modulate immune cell costinut!atory or inhibitory signals, and the ability to modulate the immune response. The term: "PD-l ligand'" refers to binding partners of the PD- l receptor and includes both PD-Ll (Freeman et ah (2000 J. Exp. Med. S 92: 102?) and PD-L2 (Latchman et at. (2001 ) Nat. Immunol. 2:261). At least two types of human PD-l ligand polypeptides exist, PD- 1 ligand proteins comprise a signal sequence, and an Ig V domain, art IgC domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Both PD-Ll (See Freeman et al. (2000) I Exp. Med. 1 2: 027 for sequence data) and PD-L2 (See Latchman et al. (2001 ) Nat. Immunol 2:261 for sequence data) are members of the B? family of polypeptides. Both PD-Ll and PD-L2 are expressed in placenta, spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, and heart. Only PD-L2 is expressed in pancreas, lung and liver, while only PD-Ll is expressed in fetal liver. Both 'PD-l ligands are uprcgu!atcd on activated monocytes and dendritic cells, although PD-L l expression is broader. For example, PD-Ll is known to be const) tutively expressed and unregulated to higher levels on murine hematopoietic ceils (e.g., T cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and bone marrow-derived mast cells) and non- hematopoietic ceils (e.g., endothelial, epithelial and muscle cells), whereas PD-L2 is indueibly expressed on DCs, macrophages, and bone marrow-derived mast cells (see, Butte et al, (2007) Immunity 27: 1 1 1 ). PD- l ligands comprise a family of polypeptides having certain conserved structural and functional features. The term "family" when used to refer to proteins or nucleic acid molecules, is intended to mean two or more proteins or nucleic acid molecules .having a common structural domain or motif and having sufficient amino acid or nucleotide sequence homology, as defined herein. Such family members can be naturally or non- naturaliy occurring and can be from either the same or different species. For example, a family can contain a first protein of human origin, as well as other, distinct proteins of human origin or alternatively, can contain homologue-s of non-human origin. Members of a family may also have common functional characteristics. PD-l iigands are members of the B7 family of polypeptides. The term "B7 family" or "B7 polypeptides" as used herein includes costiimtlatory polypeptides that share sequence homology with B7 polypeptides, e.g., with Β7- Ϊ (CD80), B7-2 (CD86), inducible ^stimulatory ligand (1COS-L), B7-H3, B7-H4, VISTA, B7-H6, B7h (Swallow e( al. (1999) Immunity 1 1 :423), and/or FD- 1 ligands (e.g., PD-LI or PD-L2). For example, human B7-1 and 87-2 share approximately 26% amino acid sequence identity when compared using the BLAST program at NCBI with the default parameters (BIosum62 matrix with gap penalties set at existence 1 1 and extension 1 (see the NCBI website). The term B7 family also includes variants of these polypeptides which are capable of modulating immune cell function. The B7 family of molecules share a number of conserved regions, including signal- domains, IgV domains and the IgC domains. gV domains and the IgC domains are art-reeognized Ig superfamily member domains. These domains correspond to structural units that have distinct folding patterns called Ig .folds. Ig folds are comprised of a sandwich of two β sheets, each consisting of anti-parallel β strands of 5-10 amino acids with a conserved disulfide bond between the two sheets in most, but not all, IgC domains of ig, TCR, and MHC molecules share the same types of sequence patterns and are called the C! -set within tie Ig superfamily. Other IgC domains fall within other sets. IgV domains also share sequence patterns and are called V set domains. IgV domains are longer than IgC domains and contain an additional pair of β strands. The term "PD-LI" refers to a specific PD-l ligand. Two forms of human PD-L I molecules have been identified. One form is a naturally occurring PD-L soluble polypeptide, i.e., having a. short hydrophilic domain at the COOH-terminaS end and no transmembrane domain, and is referred to herein as PD-LI S. The second form is a cell- associated polypeptide, i.e., having a transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain, referred to herein as PD-L IM. The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of representati ve human PD-L I biomarkers regarding PD-LI M are also available to the public at the GenBank database under NM_014!43.3 and NP_054862.1. PD-L i proteins comprise a signal sequence, and an IgV domain and an IgC domain. The signal sequence is from about amino acid 1 to about amino acid 18. The signal sequence is from about amino aetd I to about amino acid 18. The IgV domain is from about amino acid 19 to about amino acid 134 and the IgV domain is From about amino acid 1 to about amino acid 134. The IgC domain is from about amino acid 135 to about amino acid 227 and the IgC domain of SEQ ID NO: 6 is shown from about amino acid 135 to about amino acid 227, The hydrophilic tail of PD- Ll comprises hydrophilic tail shown from about amino acid 228 to about aniino acid 245. The PD-L I polypeptide comprises a transmembrane domain shown from about amino acids 239 to about amino acid 259 and a cytoplasmic domain shown of about 30 amino acids from 260 to about amino acid 290, In addition, nucleic acid and polypeptide sequences of PD-LI ortho!ogs in organisms other than humans are well known and include, for example, mouse PD-LI (Nyj>21893.3 and NP 0686 3.1), rat PD-LI (NMJ)Ol 191954.1 and P .001178883. J }, dog PD-LI (XM .541302.3 and XP 541302.3), cow PD-LI (MM 001 .163412.1 and MP 001 156884 J), and chicken PD-LI (XM 42481 ί .3 and XT 4248.1 1.3). The term "PD-L2" refers to another specific PD-l ligarid. PD-L2 is a B7 family member expressed on various APCs, trie hiding dendritic cells, macrophages and bone- marrow derived mast cells (Zhong et ah (2007) Eur. J. Immunol 37:2405). APC-expressed PD-L2 is able to both inhibit T ceil activation through ligation of PD-l and costiraulate T cell activation, through a PD-l independent mechanism (Shin et l (2005) J. Exp, Med 201 : 1531). In addition, ligation of dendritic cell-expressed PD-.L2 results irt enhanced dendritic cell cytokine expression and survival (Radhakrishrtan et al (2003) J. Immunol. 37: 1827; Nguyen ei a!. (2002) « Exp. Med. 1 6: 1393). The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of representative human PD-L2 biomar'kers are well known in the art and are also available to the public at. the GenBartk database under NM_025239.3 and NP 079515,2. PD-L2 proteins are characterized by common structural elements. In some embodiments, PD-L2 proteins include at least one or more of the following domains: a signal peptide domain, a transmembrane domain, an IgV domain, an IgC domain, an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. For example, amino acids 1-1 comprise a signal sequence. As used herein, a "signal sequence" or "signal peptide" serves to direct a polypeptide containing such a sequence to a lipid failayer, and is cleaved in secreted and membrane bound polypeptides and includes a peptide containing about 1.5 or more amino acids which occurs at the N-terniinus of secretory and membrane bound polypeptides and which contains a large number of hydrophobic aniino acid residues.

As used herein, the term "transmembrane domain" includes an amino acid sequence of about 15 amino acid residues in length which spans the plasma membrane. More preferably, a transmembrane domain includes about at least 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, or 45 amino acid residues and spans the pl sma membrane. Transmembrane domains are rich in hydrophobic residues, and typically have an alpha-helical structure. In a preferred embodiment, at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or more of the amino acids of a transmembrane domain are hydrophobic, e.g., leucines, isoleucines, tyrosines, or tryptophans. Transmembrane domains are described in, for example, Zagotta et l. (1996) Amu. Rev. Neuros i. 19: 235-263, In still another embodiment, amino acid residues 20- 120 of the native human PD-L2 polypeptide and. amino acid residues 1- !.OJ of the mature polypeptide comprise an IgV domain. Amino acid residues 121 - 21 of the native human PD-L2 polypeptide and amino acid residues 102-200 of the mature polypeptide comprise an IgC domain. As used herein, IgV and IgC domains are recognized in the art as Ig superfamily member domains. These domains correspond to structural units that have distinct folding patterns called Ig folds. Ig folds are comprised of a sandwich of two 8 sheets, each consisting of aotiparallel (3 strands of 5- 10 amino acids with a conserved disulfide bond between the two sheets in most, but not all, domains. IgC domains of Ig, TC , and MHC molecules share the same types of sequence patterns and are called the CI set within the Ig superfamily. Other IgC domains fall within other sets. IgV domains also share sequence patterns and are called V set domains. IgV domains are longer than C~ domains and form an additional pair of strands. In yet another embodiment, amino acid residues 1-21 of the native human PD-L2 polypeptide and amino acid, residues 1-200 of the mature polypeptide comprise an extracellular domain. As used herein, the term "extracellular domain" represents the N -terminal amino acids which extend as a tail from the surface of a cell.

In still another embodiment, amino acid residues 244-273 of the native human PD-L2 polypeptide and. amino acid, residues 225-273 of the mature polypeptide comprise a cytoplasmic domain. As used herein, the term ''cytoplasmic domain" represents the C-terminal amino acids which extend as a tail into the cytoplasm of a cell, in addition, nucleic acid and polypeptide sequences of PD-L2 orthologs in organisms other than humans are well known mid include, for example, mouse PD-L2 (NM 021396.2 and NP_G6737.1 .1 ), rat P.D-L2 ( MJXM 107582.2 and NP 001 101 52.2), dog PD-L2 (XM 847012.2 and XP_ 852105.2), cow PD-L2 (XM_ 586846.5 and XP .586846,3), and chimpanzee PD-L2 (XMJXH 140776.2 and XP 001 140776.1 ). The term "PD-L2 activity;' "biological activity of PD-L2," or "functional activity of PD-L2," refers to an activity exerted by a PD-L2 protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule on a PD-L2-responsive cell or tissue, or on a PD- L2 polypeptide binding partner, as determined in vivo, or in vitro, according to standard techniques, in one embodiment, a PD-L2 activity i a direct activity, such as an association with a PD-L2 binding partner. As used herein, a "target molecule" or "binding partner" is a molecule with which a FD-L2 polypeptide binds or interacts in nature, such that PD-L2 -mediated function is achieved, in an exemplary embodiment, a PD-L2 target molecule is the receptor RGMb. Alternatively, a PD-L2 activity is an indirect activity, such as a cellular signaling activity mediated by interactio of the PD- L2 polypeptide with its natural binding partner, e.g., RGMb. The biological activities of PD-L2 are described herein. For example, the PD-L2 polypeptides of the present invention can have one or more of the following activities: 1) bind to and/or modulate the activity of the receptor RGMb, PD-1 , or other PD-L2 natural binding partners, 2) modulate iatra-or intercellular signaling, 3) modulate activation of immune cells, e. g. , T lymphocytes, and 4) modulate the immune response of an organism, e.g., mouse or human organism. The term "immune response" includes T ceil mediated and/or 8 cell mediated immune responses. Exemplary immune responses include T cell responses, e.g., cytokine production and cellular cy totoxicity. In addition, the term immune response includes immune response that are indirectly effected by T cell activation, e.g., antibody production (humoral responses) and acti vation of cytokine responsive ceils, e.g., macrophages. The term "inHttunotherapeutic agent" can include any molecule, peptide, antibody or other agent which can stimulate a host immune system to generate an immune response to a tumor or cancer in the subject. Various itmniuiotlierapeutie agents are useful in the compositions and methods described herein. The- term 'inhibit" includes the decrease, limitation, or blockage, of for example a particular action, function, or interaction. n some embodiments, cancer is "inhibited" if at least one symptom of the cancer is alleviated, terminated, slowed, or prevented. As used herein, cancer is also "inhibited" if recurrence or metastasis of the cancer is reduced, slowed, delayed, or prevented. The term "interaction" when referring to an interaction between two molecules, refers to the physical contact (e.g., binding) of the molecules with one another. Generally, such an interaction results in an activity (which produces a biological effect) of one or both of said molecules. An "isolated protein" refers to a protein that is substantially free of other proteins, cellular material, separation medium, and culture medium when isolated from cells or produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. An "isolated" or purified" protein or biologically acti ve portion thereof is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the antibody, polypeptide, peptide or fusion protein is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language "substantially free of cellular material" includes preparations of a biomarker polypeptide or fragment thereof, in which the protein is separated from, cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinant!}' produced.

A "kit*" is any manufacture (e.g. a package or container) comprising at least one reagent, e.g. a probe or small molecule, for specifically detecting and/or affecting the expression of a marker of the invention. The kit may be promoted, distributed, or sold as a unit for performing the methods of the present invention. The kit may comprise one or more reagents necessary to express a composition useful m the methods of the present invention, hi certain embodiments, the kit may further comprise a reference standard, e.g.f a nucleic acid encoding a protein that does not affect or regulate signaling pathways controlling cell growth, division, migration, survival or apoptosis. One skilled in the art can envision many such control proteins, including, but not limited to, common molecular tags (e.g., green fluorescent protein and beta-galactosidase), proteins not classified in any of pathway encompassing eel! growth, division, migration, survival or apoptosis by GeneOntology reference, or ubiquitous housekeeping proteins. Reagents in the kit may be provided in individual containers or as mixtures of two or more reagents in a single container. In addition, instructional materiais w hich describe the use of the compositions within the kit can be included. The term: "neoadjuvant therapy" refers to a treatment given before the primary treatment. Examples of neoadjuvant therapy can include chenio therapy, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy, for example, in treating breast cancer, neoadjuvant therapy can allows patients with large breast cancer to undergo breast-conserving surgery. The "normal'' level of expression of a biomarker is the level of expression of the biomarker in ceils of a subject, e.g. , a human patient, not afflicted with a cancer. An "over- expression" or "significantly higher level of expression." of a biomarker refers to an expression level in a test sample that is greater than the standard error of the assa employed to assess expression, and is preferably at least twice, and more preferably 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3, 3,5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6,5, 7, 7,5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, i0, 10.5, 1 1, 12, .13, 14, 1 , 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 times or more higher than the expression activity or level of the biomarker in a control sample (e.g., sample from a healthy subject not having the biomarker associated disease) and preferably, the average expression level of the biomarker in several control samples. A "significantly lower level of expression" of a biomarker refers to an expression level in a test sample that is at least twice, and more preferably 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2,7, 2,8, 2,9, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9,5, 10, 10.5, 11 , 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 times or more lower than the expression level of the biomarker in a control sample (e.g.y sample from, a healthy subject not having the biomarker associated disease) and preferably, the average expression level of the biomarker in several control samples. The term "oncogene" refers to a well-known class of proteins that have the potential to cause cancer or a nucleic acid encoding same. Non-limiting examples of oncogenes include growth factors or mitogens such as c-Sis; receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, HER2, PDGFR, and VEGPR; cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases such as Abf and kinases in the Src-family, Syk-ZAP-70 family, and BT family of tyrosine kinases; cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases and their regulatory subunits such as PI 3CA, PIK3RL and RAF (e.g., RAF- 1 , A-RAF, B-RAF); regulatory GTPases such as RAS (e.g., KRAS); transcription factors such as MYC; and combinations thereof. By contrast, the term "tumor suppressor" refers to a well-known class of proteins that have the potential to protect a cell from becoming a cancerous cell. Non-limiting examples of tumor suppressor genes include the TP53 gene (also kno wn as the P53 gene), which encodes p53 (also known as protein 53 or tumor protein 53); kinases such as, e.g., tyrosine kinases or serine/threonine kinases including serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK 1 1 ); the RB I gene, which encodes the Retinoblastoma protein (pRb); LKBI,; PTEN; VHL; APC; CD95; ST5; YPEL3; ST7; ST 14; and combinations thereo The term "at least one mutation" in a polypeptide or a gene encoding a polypeptide and grammatical variations thereof means a polypeptide or gene encoding a polypeptide having one or more allelic variants, splice variants, derivative variants, substitution variants, deletion variants, truncation variants, and/or insertion variants, fusion polypeptides, orthologs, and/or interspecies homologs. By way of example, at least one mutation of a Ras protein would include a Ras protein in which part of all of the sequence of a polypeptide or gene encoding the Ras protein is absent or not expressed in the cell for at least one Ras protein produced in the cell. For example, a Ras protein may be produced by a ceil in a truncated form and the sequence of the truncated form may be wild type over the sequence of the truncate. A deletion may mean the absence of all or part of a gene or protein encoded by a gene. Additionally, some of a protein expressed in or encoded by a cell may be mutated while other copies of the same protein produced in the same cell may be wild type. By way of another example a mutation in a Ras protein would include a Ras protein having one or more amino acid differences in its amino acid sequence compared with wild type of the same Ras protein. By way of another example, a mutation LKBI includes, but is not limited to, an LKB I having at least one amino acid difference compared to wild type LKB i . Mutation may be somatic or gennlirte. Mutations in a polypeptide, including, but not: limited to, LKBI , can lead to expression of truncated protein. Mutations in an oncogene that cause increased activity of the oncogene to therefore promote cancer are known as ''activating mutations," Such activating mutations are well known in the art for many oncogenes and particularly for the activating mutant oncogenes described herein. Suc mutations can be constitutive (i.e., always causing increased activity) or inducible. Such mutations can also cause variable increases in oncogene activity. For example, the term "KRAS" and " R.AS,? and "HRAS" refer to specific members of the rat sarcoma (RAS) superfamily of proteins, V- i~ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), v-Ha-ras Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (HRAS), and neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog (NRAS) are the founding members of the rat sarcoma (RAS) superfamily of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) that is known to comprise 150 members in humans (Colicel (2004) Sci. STKE 20O4:R£l 3). Five subgroups of these small GTPases have been identified and designated as the RAS; ras homolog family member ( HO); RAB'IA, member RAS oncogene family (RA.B); RAN, member RAS oncogene family (RAN); and ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) families. All small GTPases function as binary switches that transition between GDP- bound, inactive and GTP-bound, acti ve forms and thereby contribute to intracellular signaling that underlies a wide array of cellular activities, including cell -proliferation, differentiation, survival, motility, cytoskeleton rearrangements, and transformation (Cox and Dear (2010) Small GTPases 1 ;2-27; Lowy et at. (1993) Amu. Rev. Biochem. 62:85 i- 891), Somatic point mutations that activate KRAS, HRAS, or NRAS have been identified in a variety of human tumors, with KRAS being the most frequently activated oncoprotein in humans. Somatic activating mutations of KRAS are thus present in > 0% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, for example (Jaffee et a , (2002) Cancer Ceil 2:25-28). Since members of the Ras family communicate signals from outside the cell to the nucleus, mutations in Ras pathway signalling can permanently activate it and cause inappropriate transmission inside the cell even in the absence of extracellular signals. Because these signals result in cell growth and division, dysreguiated RAS pathway signaling, such as promoted by aeiivatin RAS mutations, can ultimately lead to oncogenesis and cancer (Goodsell et l. (1 99) Oncologist 4: 263-264). Activated mutations in the Ras family (e.g., H~Ras, N~Ras and K-Ras) are found in 20-25% of all human tumors and up to 90% in specific tumor types (Downward et al (2003) Nat. Rev. Carreer 3: 1 1-22; Bos et ol (1989) Cancer Ras. 49:4682- 4689; Kranenburg et at (2005) Bioehim. Biophys. Acta 1756:8.1 -82). Representative human KRAS cD A and protein sequences are well-known in the art and are publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), For example, KRAS isoform 1 is a vailable under accession numbers NMJ 3360.3 and. NPJZ03524.1 and is composed of six exons, including cxon 4a, which the shorter transcript variant 2 lacks. This rare variant has a coding sequence that terminates in εχοη 4a and encodes a unique C-terminus, compared to isoform 2.

Transcript 1 (NM 005343.2) differs from transcript 3 (NMJ)01 130442.1) in the 3' UTR, but otherwise encodes the same protein. Transcript 2 (NM 005343.2) encodes an alternate exon in its 3' coding region and a different 3 'UTR from transcripts 1 and 2 resulting in a shorter isoform 2 (NP_789765.1 ) compared to isoform I and contains a distinct C-terminus as well.

Mutations in a tumor suppresso thai cause reduced activity of the tumor suppressor to therefore promote cancer are known as "inhibiting mutations." Such inhibiting mutations, such as niissense, frameshift, nonsense, deletion, addition, catalytic reduction, or other mutations, are well known in the art for many tumor suppressors and particularly for the inhibiting mutant tumor suppressors described herein. Such mutations can be constitutive (i.e., always causing decreased activity) or inducible. Such mutations can also cause variable decreases in tumor suppressor activity or be loss-of-tunctton mutations. For example, the term 'Τ,ΚΒΓ' is synonymous with Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 1 (ST l I) and is a serine/threonine protein kinase. LKB1 is a primary upstream kinase of adenine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of ceil metabolism and mamtainenancc of energy homeostasis, LK'Si suppresses cellular growth by activating a group of other kinases, comprising AMPK and AMP -re!ate kinases. Activation of AMPK by LKB I suppresses growth and proliferation when energy and nutrient levels are scarce. The human LKB gene is defective in patients with Peittz- Jeghers syndrome (PJS). PJS is an autosomal dominantly inherited syndrome characterized by hamartomatous polyposis of the gastrointestinal tract and mucocutaneous pigmentation. Over 145 different germline LKB i mutations are known and the majority of the mutations lead to a truncated protein product At least 40 different somatic LKBI mutations are known in 41 sporadic tumors and seven cancer cell lines. Mutations occur particularly in lung and colorectal cancer. Most of the somatic LKBi mutations result in truncation of the protein. Representative human LKBI cDNA and protein sequences are well-known in the art and are publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology information (NCBI).

Additional inhibiting L S'i imitations are well known in the art (see, for example, U.S. Pat. PuM. 2013-0231346 and U.S. Pat, Publ. 2014-0057798). Similarly, "PTEN" is a tumor suppressor known as Phosphatase and Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome Ten and is party of the Pl-3 Kinase-AKX pathway. The P!-3 kinase pathway controls a number of cellular functions including eel! growth, metabolism, differentiation, and apoptosis. Many types of cancer are thought to arise in response to abnormalities in signal transduction pathways of which the Pl-3 ki nase pa thway is a major example. The ΡΪ-3 kinase pathway comprises a number of enzymes in addition to PTEN, including PI-3 kinase and AKT (a serine/threonine kinase) all of which are involved in producing and maintaining intracellular levels of second messenger molecule PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PIP.*). Homeostasis in the levels of this important second messenger is maintained by the interaction betwee Pl-3 kinase and PTEN. Specifically, the PTEN gene encodes a lipid phosphatase that regulates signaling through the phosphatide linositol 3- kinase (Pi- kinase) pathway. PTEN dephosphorylates ΡΪΡ3, the product of Pl-3 kinase (for review, see Cantley ei al. (1999) Proa. Nail. Acad Set (IS, A, 96:4240-4245). As a consequence of PTEN loss and the resultant increase in P1.P3 levels, signal propagation through downstream kinases such as AKT is constititttvcly elevated. When either PI-3 kinase or PTEN are mutated and/or reduced in activity PIP3 levels are perturbed and it is believed that this perturbation acts as a trigger in the development of cancer. Such perturbation of metabolites can be detected according to well known methods in the art. Preclinical studies indicate that this indirect mode of constitutive kinase activation in tumor cells, through loss of the PTEN suppressor gene, creates a kinase dependency analogous to that seen in tumors with direct, activating mutations in the kinase itself Tumors with loss- of-function mutations in PTEN exhibit constitutive activation of AKT. The PTEN protein comprises, from amino- to carboxy-terminus, a protein tyrosine phosphatase catalytic domain that has considerable homology to the cytoskeietal protein tensin, a C2 domain that confers lipid-binding and membrane-targeting, and a PDZ domain- binding site that contributes to membrane localization and protein stability (Lee at al (1999) Cell; Wit ef al. (3000) FNAS). The amino-termina! catalytic domain includes the H. C(X) sequence, which is the signature motif of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Dual specificity phosphatase, whose substrate targets include phosphorylated protein and jiiositoi phospholipids. PTEN is distinguished by the fac t that, unlike other dual specificity phosphatases, it preferential iy dephosphorylates phosphoinositides at the D3 position of the inositol ring (Maeharria ei al ( 1 99) Trends Cell Bio , Maeharaa £/ a/. (1998) J. Biol C m.}. PTEN is the product of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN/MMAC, mutations in which have been eon-elated with a number of different tumor types, including those of the brain, prostate, endometrium, breast, and lung, (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Pufal. 2012- 0253020). Representative human PTE cDNA and protein sequences arc well-known in the art and are publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). For example, PTEN sequences are available under accession numbers NM 0003 S 4.4 and NP 000305.3. Nucleic acid and polypeptide sequences of PTEN orthologs in organisms other than humans are well known and include, for example, chimpanzee PTEN (XM_52.1544.4 and XPJ21544.3), monkey PTEN (NMJ>0i260965.1 and NP 001247894.1 ), dog PTEN (NM 0010031 2, 1 and HP 001003192.1), mouse PTEN (NM. 008960.2 and NP 032986.1 ), rat PTEN (NM. 031606.1 and NP .1 13794.1 ), chicken PTEN (XM_4215S5.4 and XP 421555.2), and zebrafish PTEN (NMJXi 1001822.2 and NP_001001822.1). Representative PTEN sequences are presented below in Table 1. it is to be noted that the term can further be used to refer to an combination of features described herein regarding PTEN molecules. For example, any combination of sequence composition, percentage identify, sequence length, domain structure, functional activity, etc. can be used to describe a PTEN molecule of the present: invention. The term "inhibiting PTEN mutation" includes any one or more mutations in the PTEN gene that reduce or eliminate PTEN tumor suppressor activity. Examples of LKB 1 mutations include, but are not limited to, missense, nonsense, irames ift deletion, addition, a kinase domain mutation, and combinations thereof, in another embodiment, the deletion, insertion or mutation of PTEN is in the catalytic kinase domain. An "over-expression" or "significantly higher level of expression" of a biomarker refers to an expression level in a test sample that is greater than the standard error of the assay employed to assess expression, and is preferably at least twice, and more preferably 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8,5, 9, 9.5, 10, I.0.5, 1 1 , 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 times or more higher than the expression activity or level of the biomarker in a control sample (e.g., sample from a healthy subject not having the biomarker associated disease) and preferably, the average expression level of the biomarker in several control samples. A "significantly Sower level of expression" of biomarker refers to an expression level in a test sample that is at least twice, and more preferably 2,1, 2.2, 2.3, 2,4, 2,5, 2,6, 2,7, 2,8, 2,9, 3, 3.5, 4 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, Sf 8.5, 9, 9,5, 10, 10.5, 1 1 , 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 times or more lower than the expression level of the biomarker in a control sample (e.g., sample from a. healthy subject not having the biomarker associated disease) and preferably, the average expression level of the biomarker in several control samples. The term "predictive" includes the use of a biomarker nucleic acid, protein, and/or metabolite status, e.g., over- or under- activity, emergence, expression, growth, remission, recurrence or resistance of tumors before, during or after therapy, for determining the likelihood of response of a cancer to anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment (e.g. , therapeutic antibodies against PD- 1 , PD-L l , and/or CTLA-4). Such predictive use of the biomarker may be confirmed by, e.g., (1 ) increased or decreased copy number (e.g., by FISH, FISH plus SKY, single-molecule sequencing, e.g., as described hi the art at least, at J. SiotechnoL 86:289-30! , or qPCR), overexpression or uuderexpression of a biomarker nucleic acid (e.g., by }'SH, Northern Blot, or qPCR), increased or decreased biomarker protein (e.g., by IHC) and/or biomarker metabolite, or increased or decreased activity (determined by, for example, modulation of oncogene biomarkers (e.g., activating mutations in oncogene biomarkers) and tumor suppressor biomarkers (e.g. , inhibiting mutations in tumor suppressors)), e.g., i more than about 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 1 1%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%, or more of assayed human cancers types or cancer samples; (2) its absolute or relatively modulated presence or absence in biological sample, e.g., a sample containing tissue, whole blood, serum, plasma, buccal scrape, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, stool, or bone marrow, from a subject, e.g. a human, afflicted with cancer; (3) its absolute or relatively modulated presence or absence in clinical subset of patients with cancer {e.g., those responding to a particular anti-tnimtme checkpoint inhibitor therapy or those developing resistance thereto). The terms "prevent" "preventing," "prevention," "prophylactic treatment," and the like refer to reducing the probability of developing a disease, disorder, or condition in a subject, who does not have, but is at risk of or susceptible to developing a disease, disorder, or condition. The term "probe" refers to any molecule which is capable of selectively binding to a specifically intended target molecule, for example, a nucleotide transcript or protein encoded by or corresponding to a biomarker nucleic acid. Probes can be either synthesized by one skilled in the art, or derived from appropriate biological preparations. For purposes of detection of the target molecule, probes may be specifically designed to be labeled, as described herein Examples of molecules that can be utilized as probes include, but are not limited to, RNA, DNA, proteins, antibodies, and organic molecules. The term "prognosis" includes a prediction of the probable course and outcome of cancer or the likelihood of recovers' from the disease. In some embodiments, the use of statistical algorithms provides a prognosis of cancer in an individual For example, the prognosis can be surgery, development of a clinical subtype of cancer (eg. , solid tumors, such as lung cancer, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma), development of one or more clinical factors, development of intestinal cancer, or recover}' from the disease. The term "response to anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy" relates to any response of the iiyperproliferative disorder {eg., cancer) to an anti -immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, such as anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, preferably to a change in tumor mass and/or volume after initiation of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Hyperproiiferative disorder response may be assessed , for example for efficacy or in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant situation, where the size of a tumor after systemic intervention can be compared to the initial size and dimensions as measured by CT, PET, mammogram, ultrasound or palpation. Responses may also be assessed by caliper measurement or pathological examination of the tumor after biopsy or surgical resection. Response may be recorded in a quantitative fashion like percentage change in tumor volume or in a qualitative fashion like "pathological complete response" (pCR), ''clinical complete remission" (eC ), ""clinical partial remission" (cPR), "clinical stable disease" (cSD), "clinical progressi ve disease" (cPD) or oilier qualitative criteria. Assessment of hyperproliferative disorder response may be done early after the onset of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, ,g., after a few hours, days, weeks or preferably after a few months. A typical endpoint for response assessment is upon termination of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or upon surgical removal of residual tumor cells and/or the tumor bed. This is typically three months after initiation of neoadjuvant therapy. In some embodiments, clinical efficacy of the therapeutic treatments described herein may be determined by measuring the clinicai benefit rate (CBBL). The clinical benefit rate is measured b determining the sum of the percentage of patients who are in complete remission (CR), the number of patients who are in partial remission (PR) and the nuniber of patients ha ving stable disease (SD) at a time point at least 6 months out from the end of therapy. The shorthand for this formula is CBR:::CR+PR+$.D over 6 months, in some embodiments, the CBR for a. particular cancer therapeutic regimen is at least 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%. 80%, 85%, or more. Additional criteria for evaluating the response to cancer therapies are related to "survival," which includes all of the following: survivai until mortality, also known as overall survival (wherein said mortality maybe either irrespective of cause or tumor related); "recurrence -free survival" (wherein the term recurrence shall include both localized and distant recurrence); metastasis free survival: disease free survival (wherein the term disease shall include cancer and diseases associated therewith). The length of said survival may be calculated by reference to a defined start point (e.g., time of diagnosis or start of treatment) and end point (e.g., death, recurrence or metastasis). In addition, criteria for efficacy of treatment can be expanded to include response to chemotherapy, probabilit of survi val, probability of metastasis within a gi ven time period, and probability of htmor recurrence. For example, in order to determine appropriate threshold values, a particular cancer therapeutic regimen can be administered to a population of subject and the outcome can be con-elated to biotnarker measurements that were determined prior to administration of any cancer therapy. The outcome measurement may be pathologic response to therapy given in the neoadjuvant setting. Alternatively, outcome measures, such a overall survival and disease-free survivai can be monitored over a period of time for subjec ts following cancer therapy for whom biomarker measurement values are known, in certain embodiments, the doses administered are standard doses known in the art for cancer therapeutic agents. The period of time for which subjects are monitored can vary. For example, subjects may be monitored for at least 2, 4, 6, 8, .10, 12, 14, 1 , .18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, or 60 months. Biotnarker measurement threshold values that correlate to outcome of a cancer therapy can be determined using well-known methods in the art, such as those described in the Examples section. The term "resistance" refers to an acquired or natural resistance of a cancer sample or a mamma! to a cancer therap ( i.e., being nonresponsivc to or having reduced or limited response to the therapeutic treatment), such as having a reduced response to a therapeutic treatment fay 25% or more, for example, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or more, to 2- fold, 3-foMf 4- old, 5-fold, 1.0-fold, 15-fold, 20-fold or more. The reduction in response can be measured by comparing with the same cancer sample or mammal before the resistance is acquired, or by comparing with a different cancer sample or a mammal who is known to have no resistance to the therapeutic treatment. A typical acquired resistance to chemotherapy is called "multidrug resistance." The multidrug resistance can be mediated by P-glycoprotein or can be mediated by other mechanisms, or it can occur when a mammal is in fected with a multi-drug-resistant microorganism or a combination of microorganisms. The determination of resistance to a therapeutic treatment is routine in the art nd within the skill of an ordinarily skilled clinician, for example, can be measured by cell proliferative assays and cell death assays as described herein as "sensitizing." In some embodiments, the term "reverses resistance" means that the use of a second agent in combination with a primary cancer therapy (e.g., chemotherapeutic or radiation therapy) is able to produce a significant decrease in tumor volume at a level of statistical significance (e.g. , p<0.05) when compared to tumor volume of untreated tumor in the circumstance where the primary cancer therapy (e.g., cbemotherapeutic or radiation therapy) alone is unable to produce a statistically significant decrease in tumor volume compared to tumor volume of untreated tumor. This generally applies to tumor volume measurements made at a time when the untreated tumor is growing log rhythmically. The terms "response" or "responsi veness" refers to an anti-cancer response, e.g. in the sense of reduction of tumor size or inhibiting tumor growth. The terms can. also refer to an improved prognosis, for example, as reflected by an increased time to recurrence, which is the period to first recurrence censoring for second primary cancer as a first event or death without evidence of recurrence, or an increased overall survival, which is the period from treatment to death from any cause. To respond or to have a response means there is a beneficial endpoint attained when exposed to a stimulus. Alternatively, a negative or detrimental symptom is minimized, mitigated or attenuated on exposure to a stimulus, it will be appreciated that evaluating the likelihood that a tumor or subject will, exhibit a favorable response is equivalent to evaluating the likelihood that the tumor or subject will not exhibit favorable response (i.e., will exhibit a lack of response or be non-responsive). An "RNA interfering agent" as used herein, is defined as any agent which interferes with or inhibits expression of a target biomarker gene by RNA interference (RNAi). Such RNA interfering agents include, but are not limited to. nucleic acid molecules including R A molecules which are homologous to the target biomarker gene- of the invention, or a fragment thereof, short interfering RNA (siRNA), and small molecules which interfere with or inhibit expression of a target biomarkcr nucleic acid by RNA interference (RNAi). "RNA interference (RNAi)" is an evolurionaHy conserved process whereby the expression or introduction of RNA of a sequence that is identical or highly similar to a target biomarker nucleic acid results in the sequence specific degradation or spec fic post- transcriptional gene silencing (PIGS) of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from that targeted gene (see Cobura, G. and Cullen, B. (2002) J. of Paralogy 76(1 ):9225), thereby inhibiting expression of the target biomarker nucleic acid. In one embodiment, the RN A is double stranded RNA (dsRNA). This process has been described in plants, invertebrates, and mammalian cells, in nature, RNAi is initiated by the dsRNA-speeific endonuclease Dicer, which promotes proeessive cleavage of long dsRNA into double- tranded fragments termed siR As. siRNAs arc incorporated into a protein complex that recognizes and cleaves target mRN s. RNAi can also be initiated by introducing nucleic acid molecules, e.g... synthetic siRNAs or RNA interfering agents, to inhibit or silence the expression of target biomarker nucleic acids. As used herein, "inhibition of target biomarker nucleic acid expression " or "inhibition of marker gene expression''' includes any decrease in expression or protein, activity or level of the target biomarker nucleic acid or protein encoded by the target biomarker nucleic acid. The decrease may be of at least 30%, 40%, 50%s 60%, 70%, 80%„ 90%, 95% or 99% or more as compared to the expression of a target biomarker nucleic acid or the acti vity or level of the protein encoded by a target biomarker nucleic acid which has not been targeted by an RN A interfering agent. The term "sample" used for detecting or determining the presence or level of at least one biomarker is typically whole blood, plasma, serum, saliva, urine, stool (e.g., feces), tears, and any other bodily fluid (t g. , as described above under the definition of "body fluids"), or a tissue sample (e.g., biopsy) such as a small intestine, colon sample, or surgical resection tissue. In certain instances, the method of the present invention further comprises obtaining the sample from the indi vidual prior to detecting or determining the presence or level of at least one marker in the sample. The term "sensitize" means to alter cancer cells or tumor ceils in a way that allows for more effective treatment of the associated cancer with a cancer therapy (e.g. , anti- immune checkpoint inhibitor, chemotherapentic, and/or radiation therapy), in some embodiments, normal cells are not affected to an extent that causes the normal ceils to be unduly injured by the anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Art increased sensitivity or a reduced sensitivity to a therapeutic treatment is measured according to a known method in the art for the particular treatment and methods described herein below, including, but not limited to, cell proliferative assays (Tamgawa N, Kern D H, ikasa Y, Morton D L, Cancer Res .1982; 42; 2.159-2164), ceil death assays (Weisenthal L M, Shoemaker R H, Marsdea J A, Dili. P L, Baker J A, Moran E , Cancer Res 1984; 94: 161-173: Weisenthal L M, Lippman M E« Cancer Treat Rep 1 85; 69; 615-632; Weisenthal L M, In: Kaspers G J L, Pieters R, Twentyman P R, Weisenthal L M, Veerman A J P, eds. Drug Resistance in Leukemia and Lymphoma. Langhorne, P A: Harwood Academic Publishers, 1993: 415- 432; Weisenthal L M, Contrib Gynecol Obstet 1994; 19: 82-90). The sensitivity or resistance may also be measured in animal by measuring the tumor size reduction over a period of time, tor example, 6 month for human and 4-6 weeks for mouse. A composition or a method sensitizes response to a therapeutic treatment if the increase in treatment sensitivity or the reduction in resistance is 25% or more, for example, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or more, to 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 20-fold or more, compared to treatment sensitivity or resistance in the absence of such composition or method. The determination of sensitivity or resistance to a therapeutic, treatment is routine in. the art and within the skill of an ordinarily skilled clinician, it. is to be understood that any method described herein for enhancing the efficacy of a cancer therapy can be equally applied to methods for sensitizing ηνρεφΓθΙίίεκιίίνε or otherwise cancerous cells (e.g., resistant cells) to the cancer therapy. The term ''synergistic effect" refers to the combined effect of two or more anti- immune checkpoint inhibitor agents can be greater than the sum of the separate effects of the anticancer agents alone. "Short interfering RNA" (siRNA), also referred to herein as "small interfering RNA" is defined as an agent which functions to inhibit expression of a target biomarker nucleic acid, e.g., by Ai. An siRNA may be chemically synthesized, may be produced b in vitro transcription, or may be produced within a host cell, in one embodiment, stR A is a double stranded R.N A (dsRNA) molecule of about 1 to about 40 nucleotides in length, preferably about 15 to about. 28 nucleotides, more preferably about 19 to about 25 nucleotides in length, and more preferably about 1 , 20, 1, or 22 nucleotides in length, and may contain a 3' and/or 5' overhang on each strand having a length of about 0, 1, 2, 3, 45 or 5 nucleotides. The length of the overhang is independent between the two strands, i.e., the length of the overhang on one strand is not dependent 0 the length of the overhang on the second strand. Preferably the siRNA is capable of promoting RNA interference through degradation or specific post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of die target messenger RNA (ra'RNA). in another embodiment,, an siRNA i a small hairpin (also called stem loop) RNA (shR A). in one embodiment, these shRNAs are composed of a short (e.g., 19-25 nucleotide) annscnse strand, followed by a 5-9 nucleotide loop, and the analogous sense strand. Alternatively, the sense strand may precede the nucleotide loop structure and the antisense strand may follow. These shRNAs may be contained in plasroids, retroviruses, and lentivtruses and expressed from, for example, the pol ΙΪΪ U6 promoter, or another promoter (.vet?, e.g., Stewart, et al. (2003) RNA Apr;9(4):493-501 incorporated by reference herein). R A interfering agents, e.g., siRNA molecules, may be administered to a patient having or at risk for having cancer, to inhibit expression of a biomarker gene which is overexpressed in cancer and thereby treat, prevent, or inhibit cancer in the subject. The term "subject" refers to any healthy animal, mammal or human, or an animal, mammal or human afflicted with a cancer, e.g. , lung, ovarian, pancreatic, liver, breast, prostate, and colon carcinomas, as well as melanoma and multiple myeloma. The term ""subject" is interchangeable with "patient.'" The term: "survival" include ail of the following: survival until mortality, also known as overall survival (wherein said mortality may be either irrespective of cause or tumor related); ""recurrence-free survival" (wherein the term recurrence shall include both localized and distant recurrence); metastasis free survival; disease free survival (wherein the term disease sha!i include cancer and diseases associated therewith). The length of said survival may be calculated by reference to a defined start point (e.g. time of diagnosis or start of treatment) and end point (e.g. death, recurrence or metastasis). In addition, criteria for efficacy of treatment can be expanded to include response to chemotherapy, probability of survival, probability of metastasis within a given time period, and probability of tumor recurrence. The term "therapeutic effect" refers to a local or systemic effect in animals, particularly mammals, and more particularly humans, caused by a pharmacologically acti ve substance. The term thus means any substance intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease or in the enhancement of desirable physical or mental development and conditions in m animal or human. The phrase ""therapeuticail - effective amount" means that amount of such a substance that produces some desired local or systemic effect at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any treatment. In certain embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound will depend on its therapeutic index,, solubility, and the like. For example, certain compounds discovered by the methods of the present invention may be administered in a sufficient amount to produce a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to such treatment. The terms ' herapeutieally-effeetive amount" and ''effective amount*" as used herein means that amount of a compound, material, or composition comprising a compound of the present invention which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect in at least a sub-population of cells in an animal at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of subject compounds may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g.„ for determining the LD$o and the ED$». Compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred, in some embodiments, the LD¾> (lethal dosage) can be measured and can be, for example, at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900%, 1.000% or more reduced for the agent relative to no administration of the agent. Similarly, the EDso (>'.<?., the concentration which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) can be measured and can be. for example, at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900%, 1000 or more increased for the agent relative to no administration of the agent. Also, Similarly, the ICs (i.e., the concentration which achieves half-maximal cytotoxic or cytostatic effect on cancer cells) can be measured and can be, for example, at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900%, 1 00% or more increased for the agent, relative to no administration of the agent. In some embodiments, cancer cell growth in an assay can be inhibited by at least about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or even 100%. In another embodiment, at least about a 10% , 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or even 100% decrease in a solid malignancy can be achie ved. A "transcribed polynucleotide" or "nucleotide transcript" is a polynucleotide (e.g. an niRNA, hnRNA, a cDN A, or an analog of such RNA or cDNA) which is complementary to or homologous with ail or a portion of a mature mRNA made by transcription of a biomarker nucleic acid and normal posWranseriptional processing (e.g. splicing), if any, of the RNA transcript, and reverse transcription of the RNA transcript. There is a known and definite correspondence between the amino acid sequence of a particular protein and the nucleotide sequences that can code for the protein, as defined by the genetic code (shown below). Likewise, there is a known and definite correspondence between the nucleotide sequence of a particular nucleic acid and the amino acid sequence encoded by that nucleic acid, as defined by the genetic code.

Therefore,, a number of different nucleotide sequences may code for a given amino acid sequence. Suck nucleotide sequences are considered functionally equivalent since they result in the production of the same amino acid sequence in all organisms (although certain organisms may translate some sequences more efficiently than they do others). Moreover, occasionally, a methylated variant of a purine or pynmidine may be found in a given nucleotide sequence. Such rnerhylations do not affect the coding relationship between the trinucleotide eodon and the corresponding amino acid. in view of the foregoing, the nucleotide sequence of a DNA or RNA encoding a biomarkcf nucleic acid (or any portion thereof) can be used to derive the polypeptide amino acid sequence, using the genetic code to translate the DNA or RNA into an amino acid sequence. Likewise, for polypeptide amino acid sequence, corresponding nucleotide sequences that can en de the polypeptide can be deduced from the genetic code (which, because of its redundancy, will produce multiple nucleic acid sequences for any given amino acid sequence). Thus, description and/or disclosure herein of a nucleotide sequence which encodes a polypeptide should be considered to also include description and/or disclosure of the amino acid sequence encoded by the -nucleotide sequence. Similarly, description, and/or disclosure of a polypeptide amino acid se uence herein, should be considered to also include description and/or disclosure of all possible nucleotide sequences that can encode the amino acid sequence.

Subjects In one embodiment, the subject for whom predicted likel ihood of efficacy of an anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is determined, is a mammal C . : mouse, rat, primate, non-human mammal, domestic animal such as dog, eat, cow, horse), and is preferably a human. In another embodimen t of the methods of the invention, the subject has not. undergone treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and/or anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In still another embodiment, the subject has undergone treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and/or anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In certain embodiments, the subject has had surgery to remove cancerous or precancerous tissue. In other embodiments, the cancerous tissue has not been remo ved, e.g., the cancerous tissue may be located in an inoperable region of the body, such as in a tissue that is essential for life, or in a region where a surgical procedure would cause considerable risk of harm to the patient. The methods of the invention can be used to determine the responsiveness to anti- immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies of many different cancers in subjects such as those described above. In one embodiment, die cancers are solid tumors, such as lung cancer or lung cancer subtypes (e.g., squamous cell carcrnormX melanoma, and/or renal cell carcinoma. In another embodiment, the cancer is an epithelial cancer such as, but not limited to, brain cancer (e.g., glioblastomas) bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, gynecologic cancers, renal cancer, laryngeal cancer, lung cancer, oral cancer, head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, or skin cancer. In still other embodiments, the cancer is breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, or colon cancer. In still other embodiments, the epithelial cancer is uon-small-celi lung cancer, nonpapil!ary renal cell carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma (e.g.> serous ovarian carcinoma), or breast carcinoma.. The epithelial cancers may be characterized in various other ways including, but not limited to, serous, endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell, brenner, or undifferentiated. 1.11. Sample Cghecdon,. F in some embodiments, biomarker amount and/or acti vity measurements) in a sample .from a subject is compared to a predetermine control (standard) sample. The sample from the subject is typically from a diseased tissue, such as cancer ceils or tissues. The control sample can be from the same subject or from a different subjec t. The control sample i typically a normal, non-diseased sample. However, in some embodiments, such as for staging of disease or for evaluating the efficacy of treatment, the control sample can be from a diseased tissue. The control sample can be a combination of samples from several different subjects. In some embodiments, the biomarker amount and/or activity measurements) from a subject is compared to a pre-determined level. This pre-determined level is typically obtained from normal samples. As described herein, a "pre-determined" biomarker amount and/or activity measurements) may be a biomarker amount and/or activity measurements) used to, by way of example only, evaluate a subject that may be selected for treatment, evaluate a response to an anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and/or evaluate a response to a combination anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. A pre-determined biomarker amount and/or activity measurements) may be determined in populations of patients with or without cancer. The pre-determined biomarker amount and or acti vit measurements) can be a single number, equally applicable to every patient, or the pre-determined biomarker amount and/or activity measurements) can vary according to specific subpopulaiions of patients. Age, weight, height, and other factors of a subject may affect the redete mined biomarker amount and/or activity measurements) of the individual. Furthermore, the pre-deterrained biomarker amount and/or aeti vity can be determined for each subject individually. In one embodiment, the amounts determined ami or compared in a method described herein are based on absolute measurements. In another embodiment, the amounts determined and/or compared in a method described herein are based on relative measurements, such as ratios (e.g. , expression and/or activity of activating oncogene biomarkers to that of wild type oncogene biomarkers. expressio and/or activity of inhibiting tumor suppressor biomarkers to that of wild type tumor suppressor biomarkers, and expression and/or activity of a biomarker of interest normalized to that of a housekeeping gene). The pre-deiermined biomarker amount and/or activity measurements) can be any suitable standard. For example, the pre-determincd biomarker amount and'or activity measurements) can be obtained from the same or a different human for whom a patient selection is being assessed. In one embodiment, the predetermined biomarker amount and/or acti vity measurements can be obtained from a previous assessment of the same patient. In such a manner, the progress of the selection of the patient can be monitored over time. In addition., the control can be obtained from an assessment of another human or multiple humans, e.g. , selected groups of humans, if the subject is a human. In such a manner, the extent of the selection of the human for whom selection is being assessed can be compared to suitable other humans, e.g., other humans who are in a similar situation to the human of interest, such as those suffering from similar or the same condition(s) and/or of the same ethnic group. In some embodiments of the present invention the change of biomarker amount and/or activity measurement's) from the pre-determined level is about 0.5 fold, about 1 .0 fold, about 1.5 fold, about 2.0 fold, about 2.5 fold, about 3.0 fold, abou 3.5 fold, about 4.0 fold, about 4.5 fold, or about 5.0 fold or greater, in some embodiments, the fold change is less than about 1 , less than about 5, less than about 10, less than abotit 20, less than about 30, less than about 40, or less than about 50. In other embodiments, the fold change in biomarker amount and/or activity measurement's) compared to a predetermined level is more than about 1 , more than about 5, more than about 10, more than about 20, more than abotit 30, more than about 40, or more than about 50, Biological samples can be collected from a variety of sources from a patient including a body fluid sample, cell sample,, or a tissue sample comprising nucleic acids and/or proteins, "Body fluids'" refer to fluids that are excreted or secreted from the body as well as fluids that are•normally not (e.g., bronchoalevolar lavage fluid, amniotic fluid, aqueous humor, bile, blood and blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, cerumen and earwax, cowper s fluid or pre-ejaculatory fluid, chyle, chyme, stool, female ejaculate, interstitial fluid, intracellular fluid, lymph, menses, breast milk, mucus, pleural fluid, pus, saliva, sebum, semen, serum, sweat, synovial fluid, tears, urine, vagina! lubrication, vitreous humor, vomit), in a preferred embodiment, the subject and/or control sample is selected from the group consisting of cells, cell lines, histological slides, paraffin embedded tissues, biopsies, whole blood, nipple aspirate, serum, plasma, buccal scrape, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, stool, and bone marrow, in one embodiment, the sample is serum, plasma, or urine. IN another embodiment, the sample is serum. The samples can be collected from individuals repeatedly over a longitudinal period of time (e.g., once or more on the order of days, weeks, months, annually, biannuaily, etc.). Obtaining numerous samples from an individual over a period of time can be used to verify results from earlier detections and/or to identify an alteration in biological pattern as a result of, for example, disease progression, drug treatment, etc. For example, subject samples can be taken and monitored every month, every two months, or combinations of one, two, or three month intervals according to the invention. In addition, the biomarker amount and/or activity measurements of the subject obtained over time can be conveniently compared with each other, as well as with those of normal controls during the monitoring period, thereby providing the subject's own values, as an internal, or personal, control for Song-term monitoring. Sample preparation and separation can involve any of the procedures, depending on the type of sample collected and/or analysis of biomarker measuremenf(s). Such procedures include, by way of example only, concentration, dilution, adjustment of pH, removal of high abundance polypeptides {e.g., albumin, gamma globulin, and transferrin, etc), addition of preservatives and calibrates, addition of protease inhibitors, addition, of denaturants, desalting of samples, concentration of sample proteins, extraction and purification of lipids. The sample preparation can also isolate molecules that are bound in uon-eovalent complexes to other protein (e.g., carrier proteins). This process may isolate those molecules bound to a specific carrier protein (e.g.^ albumin), or use a more general process. such as the release of bound molecule from ail carrier proteins via protein denaturation, for example using an acid, followed b removal of the carrier proteins. Removal of undesired proteins (e.g., high abundance, iininformative, or undetectable proteins) from a sample can be achieved using high affinity reagents, high molecular weight filters, uUracentrif ligation and/or electrodialysis. High affinity reagents include antibodies or other reagents (e.g., aptamers) thai selectively bind to high abundance proteins. Sample preparation couid also include ion exchange chromatography, metal ion affinity chromatography, gel filtration, hydrophobic chromatography, chrom tofocusing, adsorption chromatography, isoelectric focusing and related techniques. Molecular weight filters include membranes that separate molecules on the basis of size and molecular weight. Such filters may further employ reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration and microfiltratioii. Uitracenirifugaiioo. is a method for removing undesired polypeptides from a sample, Uliraeenirifugarion is the eentrifugation of a sample at about 15,000-60,000 rpm while monitoring with an optical system the sedimentation (or lack thereof) of particles. Electrodialysis is a procedure which uses an eleciromembrane or semipermable membrane in a process in which ions arc transported through semi-permeable membranes from one solution to another under the influence of a potential gradient. Since the membranes used in electrodialysis may have the ability to selectively transport ions having positive or negati ve charge, reject ions of the opposite charge, or to allow species to migrate through a scraipermable membrane based on size and charge, it renders electrodialysis useful for concentration, removal, or separation of electrolytes. Separation and purification in the present invention may include any procedure known in the art, such as capillary electrophoresis (e.g., in capillary or on-chip) or chromatography (e.g., in capillary, column or on a chip). Electrophoresis is a method which can be used to separate ionic molecules under the influence of an electric field. Electrophoresis can be conducted in a gel, capillary, or in a microchannel on a chip. Examples of gels used for electrophoresis include starch, acr lamide, polyethylene oxides, agarose, or combinations thereof. A gel can be modified by its cross-linking, addition of detergents, or denaturants, immobilization of enzymes or antibodies (affinity electrophoresis) or substrates (zymography) and incorporation of a pH gradient. Examples of capillaries used for electrophoresis include capillaries that interface with an electrospray. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is preferred for separating complex hydrophiiic molecules and highly charged solutes. CE technology can also be implemented on microfiuidic chips. Depending 00 the types of capillary and buffers used, CE can be furdier segmented into separation techniques such as capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF), capillary isotachophoresis (elTP) and. capillary electrochromatography (CEC). An embodiment to couple CE techniques to electrospray ionization involves the. use. of volatile solutions, for example, aqueous mixtures containing' a volatile acid and or base and an organic such as an alcohol or acetonitrile. Capillary isotachophoresis (clTP) is a technique in which the analytes move through the capillary at a constant speed but are nevertheless separated by their respective mobilities. Capiiiarv zone electrophoresis (CZE), also known as free-solution CE (FSCE), is based on differences in the e!ectrophoretic mobility of the species, determined by the charge on the molecule, and the frictional resistance the molecule encounters during migration which is often directly proportional to the size of the molecule. Capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) allows weakly-ionizable amphoteric molecules, to be separated by electrophoresis in a pH gradien CEC is a hybrid technique between traditional high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and CE. Separation and purification techniques used in the present in vention include any chromatography procedures known in the art. Chromatography can be based on the dif erential adsorption and elution of certain analyte or partitioning of analytes between mobile and stationary phases. Different examples of chromatography include, but not limited to, liquid chromatography (LC), gas chromatography (GC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), etc. IV, Biomarker Nucleic Acids and Polypeptides One aspect of the invention pertains to the use of isolated nucleic acid molecules that correspond to biomarker nucleic acids that encode a biomarker polypeptide or a portion of such a polypeptide. As used herein, the term "nucleic acid molecule" is intended to include DNA molecules (e.g., e'D A or genomic DNA) and R'NA molecules (e.g. , m'RNA and analogs of the DNA or R A generated using nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA. An "isolated" nucleic acid molecule is one which is separated from other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid molecule. Preferably, an "isolated" nucleic acid molecule i free of sequences (preferabiy protein- encoding sequences) which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5' and 3' ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kB, 4 kB, 3 kB, 2 kB, 1 kB, 0.5 kB or 0.1 kB of nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an "isolated" nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. A biomarker nucleic acid molecule of the present invention can be isolated using standard molecular biology techniques and the sequence information in the database records described herein. Using ail or a portion of such nucleic acid sequences, nucleic acid molecules of the invention can be isolated using standard hybridization and cloning techniques (e.g., as described in Sambrook ef ΰ/., ed.. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989). A nucleic acid molecule of the invention can be amplified using cDNA, raR A, or genomic DN A as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers according to standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid molecules so amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to ail or a portion of a nucleic acid molecule of the invention can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques, e.g., using an automated DNA synthesizer. Moreover, a nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of a nucleic acid sequence, wherein the full length nucleic acid sequence comprises a marker of the invention or which encodes a polypeptide corresponding to a marker of the invention. Such nucleic acid molecules can be used, for example, as a probe or primer. The probe/primer typically is used as one or more substantially purified oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide typically comprises a region of nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent conditions to at least about 7, preferably about 15, more preferably about 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, or 400 or more consecutive nucleotides of a biomarker nucleic acid sequence. Probes based on the sequence of a biomarker nucleic acid molecule can be used to detect transcripts or genomic sequences corresponding to one or more markers of the invention. The probe comprises a label group attached thereto, e.g. , a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, art enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. A biomarker nucleic acid molecules that differ, due to degeneracy of the genetic code, from the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acid molecules encoding a protein which corresponds to the biomarker, and thus encode the same protein, are also contemplated. in addition, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that DNA sequence polymorphisms that lead to changes in the amino acid sequence can exist within a population (e.g., the human population). Such genetic polymorphisms can exist among individuals within a population due to natural allelic variation. An allele is one of a group of genes which occur alternatively at a given genetic locus, in addition, it will be appreciated that DNA polymorphisms that affect RNA expression levels can also exist that may affect the overall expression level of that gene (e.g. , by affecting regulation or degradation). The term "allele," which is used interchangeably herein with "allelic variant," refers to alternative forms of a gene or portions thereof. Aileles occupy the same locus or position on homologous chromosomes. When a subject has two identical aileles of a gene, the subject is said to be homozygous for the gene or allele. When a subject has two different alleles of a gene, the subject is said to be heterozygous for the gene or allele. For example, biomarker alleles can differ from each other in a single nucleotide, or several nucleotides, and can include substitutions, deletions, and insertions of nucleotides. An allele of a gene can also be a form of a gene containing one or more mutations. The term "allelic variant of a polymorphic region of gene" or ""allelic variant", used interchangeably herein, refers to an alternative form of a gene having one of several possible nucleotide sequences found in that region of the gene in the population. As used herein, allelic variant is meant to encompass functional allelic variants, non-functional allelic variants, SNPs, mutations and polymorphisms. The term: "single nucleotide polymorphism" (SNP) refers to a polymorphic site occupied b a single nucleotide, which, is the site of variation between allelic sequences. The site is usually preceded by and followed by highly conserved sequences of the allele (e.g., sequences that vary in less than 1/100 or 1/1.000 members of a population). A SNP usually arises due to substitution of one nucleotide for another at the polymorphic site. SNPs can aiso arise from a deletion of a nucleotide or an insertion of a nucleotide relative to a reference allele. Typically the polymorphic site is occupied by a base other than the reference base. For example, where the reference allele contains the base 4 " (thymidine) at the polymorphic site, the altered allele can contain a "C" (cytidine), "CT (guanine), or "A" (adenine) at the polymorphic site, SNP's may occur in protein-coding nucleic acid sequences, in which case they may give rise to a defective or otherwise variant protein, or genetic disease. Such a SNP may alter the coding sequence of the gene and therefore specify another amino acid (a. "missense-" SNP) or a. SNP may introduce a stop codon (a "no sense" SNP). When a SNP does not alter the amino acid sequence of a protein, the SNP is called "siietK." SNP's may also occur in noncoding regions of the nucleotide sequence. This may result in defective protein expression, e.g., as a result: of alternative spicing, or it may have no effect on the function of the protein. As used herein, the terms "gene" and "recombinant gene" refer to nucleic acid molecules comprising an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a marker of the invention. Such natural allelic variations can typically result in 1 -5% variance in the nucleotide sequence of given gene. Alternative alleles can be identified by sequencing the gene of interest in a number of different individuals. This can be readily carried out by using hybridization probes to identify the same genetic locus in a variety of individuals. Any and ail such nucleotide variations and resulting amino acid polymorphisms or variations that are the result of natural allelic variation, and that do n ot alter the functional activity are intended to be within the scope of the invention. In another embodiment,, a biornarker nucleic acid molecule i at least 7, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 80, tOO, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 550, 650, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1 100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent conditions to a nucleic acid molecule corresponding to a marker of the invention or to a nucleic acid molecule encoding a protein corresponding to a marker of the invention. As used herein, the teiin "hybridizes under stringent conditions'' is intended to describe conditions for hybridization and washing under which nucleotide sequences at least 60% (65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, preferably 85%) identical to each other typicall remain hybridized to each other. Such stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in sections 6.3.1 -6.3.6 of Current Protocols in Molecular Biology., John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), A preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions are hybridization in 6X sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at aboitt 45"C, followed by one or more washes in 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50-65 . in addition to naturally-occurring allelic variants of a nucleic acid molecule of the invention that can exist in the population, the skilled artisan will further appreciate that sequence changes can be introduced by imitation thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, without altering the biological activity- of the protein encoded thereby. For example, one can make nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at "non-essential" amino acid residues. A "non-essential" ammo acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence without altering the biological activity, whereas an "essential" amino acid residue is required for biological activity. For example, amino acid residues that are not conserved or only semi-conserved among homologs of various species may be non-essential for activity and thus would be likely targets for alteration. Alternatively, amino acid residues that are conserved among the homologs of various species (e.g., murine and human) ma be essential for activity and thus would not be likely targets for alteration. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention pertains to nucleic acid molecules encoding a polypeptide of the invention that contain changes in amino acid residues that are not essential for activity. Such polypeptides differ in amino acid se uence from the naturally-occurring proteins which correspond to the markers of the invention, yet retain biological activity, in one embodiment, a bioroarker protein has an amino acid sequence that is at least about 40% identical, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 83%, 85%, 87.5%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or identical to the amino acid sequence of a biomarker protein described herein. An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a variant protein can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids of the invention, such that one or more amino acid residue substitutions, additions, or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations can be introdiiced by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Preferably, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues, A "conservative amino acid substitution" is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g. , lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g. , aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), non-polar side chains {e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isokucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains {e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Alternatively, imitations can be introduced randomly along all or part of the coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis, the encoded protein can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the protein can be determined. In some embodiments, the present invention further contemplates the use of ami- biomarker ami sense nucleic acid molecules, i.e., molecules which are complementary to a sense nucleic acid of the invention, e.g., complementary to the coding strand of a double- stranded C.DN A molecule corresponding to a marker of the invention or complementary to an mR A sequence corresponding to a marker of the Invention. Accordingly, an antisense nucleic acid molecule of the invention can hydrogen bond to (i.e. anneal with) a. sense nucleic acid of the invention. The antisense nucleic acid can be complementary to art entire coding strand, or to only a portion thereof, e.g., all or part of the protein coding region (or open reading frame). An aotisense nucleic acid molecule can also be antisense to all or part of a non-coding region of the coding strand of a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention. The non-coding regions ("5' and 3' untranslated regions") are die 5' and 3' sequences which flank the coding region and are not translated into amino acids. An antisense oligonucleotide can be, for example, about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 5, or 50 or more nucleotides in length. An antisense nucleic acid can be constructed using chemical synthesis and enzymatic ligation reactions using procedures known in the art. For example, an antisense nucleic acid (e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide) can be chemically synthesized using naturally occurring nucleotides or variously modified nucleotides designed to increase the biological stability of the molecules or to increase the physical stability of the duplex formed between the antisense and sense nucleic acids, e.g., phosphorothioate derivatives and acridine substituted nucleotides can be used. Examples of modified nucleotides which can be used to generate the antisense nucleic acid include 5- fiuorourac.il. 5-bromouracil, 5-chlorouracil, 5-iodouracil, hypoxanthine, xanthine, 4- acetylcytosme, 5-(carboxyhydroxylniethyl) uracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomemyl-2- thiouridine, 5-carboxymethylaminomefhyluraciU dihydrouracil, beta-D-gaiaetosylqueosine, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenine, i~mediy!guanine, Ϊ -methylinosine, 2,2~dimethylguanine5 2- methyladenine, 2~methyigitanine5 3-methylc tosine., 5-methylcytosme, N6~adenine, 7- methylguanine, 5 -methyl aminomethyl uracil, 5-metk>xyaraim>methy1~2-thiouraeiif heta-D~ annosylqueosine, S'-methoxycar oxymethyluracil, 5-methoxyuraciI, 2-methylthio-N6- isopentenyladenine, uracil-S-oxyacetie aeid (v), wybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosme, 2- thiocytosine, 5-methyl-2~thiouraciS, 2-thiouraciL, 4~thiouracil, 5-methylitraeil, uracii-5- oxyaeetie acid methylesier, nracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), 5-meihyl-2-thiouracil, 3-(3-amino- 3- N-2~earboxyprop l) uracil, facp3)w, and 2,6-diaraijK purine. Alternatively, the antisense nucleic acid can be produced biologically using an expression vector into which a nucleic acid has been sub-cloned in an antisense orientation (i.e. , RNA transcribed from the inserted nucleic acid will be of an antisense orientation to a target nucleic acid of interest, described further irt the following subsection). The antisense nucleic acid molecules of the invention are typically administered to a subject or generated w situ such that they hybridize with or bind to cellular tn'RNA and/or genomic D A encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a selected marker of the invention to thereby inhibit expression of the marker, e.g., by inhibiting transcription and/or translation. The hybridization can be by conventional nucleotide complementarity to form a stable duplex, or, for example, in the case of an antisense nucleic acid molecule which binds to DMA duplexes, through specific interactions in the major groove of the double helix. Examples of a route of administration of antisense nucleic acid molecules of the invention includes direct injection at a tissue site or infusion of the antisense nucleic acid into a blood- or bone marrow-associated body fluid. Alternatively, antisense nucleic acid molecules can be modified to target selected cells and then administered systemically. For example, for systemic administration, antisense molecules can be modified such that they specifically bind to receptors or antigens expressed on a selected cell surface, e.g., by linking the antisense nucleic acid molecules to peptides or antibodies which bind to cell surface receptors or antigens. The antisense nucleic acid molecules cart also be delivered to cells using the vectors described herein. To achieve sufficient intracellular concentrations of the antisense molecules, vector constructs in w hich the antisense nucleic acid molecule is placed under the control of a strong pol 11 or pol 111 promoter arc preferred. An antisense nucleic acid molecule of the invention can be an a-anomerie nucleic acid molecule. An ot-anomeric nucleic acid molecule forms specific double-stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which, contrary to the usual a-units, the strands run parallel to each other (Gaultier et a!., 1 87, Nucleic Acids Res. 15:6625-6641). The antisense nucleic acid molecule can also comprise a 2,-o-methy!ribonuc!eotide (Inone et al, 1987, Nucleic Acids Res. 15:6131 -6148) or a chimeric RNA-DNA analogue (Inoue ei al, 1987, FBBS leti. 215:327-330). The present invention also encompasses .ribozymes. R.iboxynies are catalytic RNA molecules with ribonuc lease activity which are capable of cleaving a single-stranded nucleic acid, such as an mRNA, to which they have a complementary region. Tints, ribozymes (e.g.s hammerhead ribozymes as described in Haselhoff arid Ger!aeh, 1 88, Nature 334:585-591) can be used to eatalytiealiy cleave mRNA. transcripts to thereby inhibit translation of the protein encoded by the mRNA. A nbozyme having specificity for a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a marker of the invention cart be designed based upon the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA corresponding to the marker. For example, a deri vative of a Tetrahymeim L-1 IV S RNA can be constructed in which the nucleotide sequence of the active site is complementary to the nucleotide sequence to be cleaved (see Cech et al U.S. Patent No. 4,987,07 i ; and Ceeh et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,116,742). Alternatively, an mRNA encoding a polypeptide of the invention can be used to select a catalytic RNA having a specific ribouuclease activit from a pool of RNA molecules (see, e.g.,. Bartel and Szostak, 1993, Science 261 : 141 1-1418). The present invention also encompasses nucleic acid molecules which form triple helical structures. For example, expression of a biomarker protein can be inhibited by targeting nucleotide sequences complementary to the regulatory region of the gene encoding the polypeptide (e.g. , the promoter and/or enhancer) to form triple helical structures that prevent transcription of the gene in target ceils. See generally Helene (1991) Anticancer Drug Des. 6(6);569-84; Helene (1992) Ann. N. Y, Acad Set. 660:27-36; and Maher (1992) Bioassays 14(12):807-i 5. in various embodiments, the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety or phosphate backbone to improve, e.g., the stability, hybridization, or solubility of the molecule. For example, the deoxyribose phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid molecules can be modified to generate peptide nucleic acid molecules (see Hyrup et l, 1 96, Bioorganic ά Medicinal Chemistry 4(1): 5- 23). As used herein, the terms "peptide nucleic acids" or "PNAs" refer to nucleic acid mimics, e.g., DNA mimics, in which the deoxyribose phosphate backbone is replaced by a pseudopeptide backbone and only the four natural iiucleobases are retained. The neutral backbone of PNAs has been shown to allow for specific hybridization to DNA and RNA under conditions of knv ionic strength. The synthesis of PNA oligomers can he performed using standard solid phase peptide synthesis protocols as described in Hyrup et al. (.1 96), supra; Perry-O'Keeie ei al ( 1 96) Proc. Natl. Acad. S t. USA 93: 14670-675, PNAs can be used in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. For example, P As can he used as ami sense or antigene agent for sequence-specific modulation of gene expression by , e.g. , inducing transcription or translation arrest or inhibiting replication. PNAs can also be used, e.g., in the analysis of single base pair mutations in a gene by, e.g., PNA directed PGR clamping; as artificial restriction enzymes when used io combination with other enzymes, e.g. , Si nucleases (Hyrup ( 1996), supra: or as probes or primers for DNA sequence and hybridization (Hyrup, 1996, supra; Perry-O' eefe et al, 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Set USA 93: 14670-675). in another embodiment, PNAs can be modified, e.g. , to enhance their stability or cellular uptake, by attaching lipophilic or other helper groups to PNA, by the formation of PNA-DNA chimeras, or by the use of liposomes or other techniques of drug delivery known in the art. For example, PNA-DNA chimeras can be generated which can combine the advantageous properties of PN A and DNA. Such chimeras allow DNA recognition enzymes, e.g., RNASE H and DN A polymerases, to interact with the DNA portion while the PNA portion would provide high binding affinity and specificity. PNA-DNA chimeras can he linked using linkers of appropriate lengths selected in terms of base stacking, number of bonds between tie nucleobases, and orientation (Hyrup, 1 96, supra). The synthesis of PNA-D A chimeras can be performed as described in Hyrup (1 96), supra, and Finn et cil. ( 1996) Nucleic Acids Res. 24( 17):3357~63. For example, a DNA chain can be synthesized on a solid support using standard phosphoramidite coupling chemistry and modified nucleoside analogs. Compounds such as 5'-(4-mefhoxytrityi)amino-5'-deoxy- thymidine phosphoramidite can be used as a link between the PNA and the 5' end of DNA (Mag et al., 1989, Nucleic Acids Res. 17:5973-88). PNA monomers are then coupled in a step-wise manner to produce a chimeric molecule with a 5' PNA segment and a 3' DN A segment (Finn et al., 1 96, Nucleic Acids Res. 24( I ?.):3357-63), Alternatively, chimeric molecules can be synthesized with a 5' D segment and a 3' PNA segment (Peferser et al, 1.975, Bioorgame Med. Chem. Lett. 5: 11 19-1 1 1.24). in other embodiments, the oligonucleotide can include other appended groups such as peptides (e.g., for targeting host cell receptors in vivo), or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane (see, e.g., Letsinger et at, 1 89, Proc. Nail. Acad. Set. USA 86:6553-6556; Lemaitre et aL, 1987. Froc. Nail. Acad. ScL USA 84:648-652; PCX Publication No. WO 88/098.10) or die blood-brain barrier (see, e.g. , PCX Publication No. WO 89/10134). In addition, oligonucleotides can be modified with hybridization-triggered cleavage agents (see, e.g., Krol e/ a/., 1988, Bio Techniqtm 6:958-976) or intercalating agents (see, e.g., Zon, 1988, Pharm. Res, 5 539-549). To this end, the oligonucleotide can be conjugated to another molecule, e.g., a peptide, hybridization triggered cross-linking agent, transport agent, hybrielization-iriggered cleavage agent, etc. Another aspect of the invention pertains to the use of biomarker proteins and biologically active portions thereof. In one embodiment, the native polypeptide corresponding to a marker can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques, in another embodiment, polypeptides corresponding to a marker of the invention arc produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Alternative to recombinant expression, a polypeptide corresponding to a marker of the invention can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques. An "isolated" or "purified" protein or biologically acti ve portion thereof is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the ceil or tissue source from which the protein is derived, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language "substantially free of cellular material'" includes preparation of protein in which the protein is separated from cellular components of the ceils from which it is isolated or recombinant!}' produced, Tims, protein that is substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of protein having less than about 30%, 20%, .1 %, or 5% (b dry weight) of heterologous protein (also referred to herein as a "contaminating protein"). When the protein or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantSy produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, Le., culture medium represents less than about 20%, 10%, or 5% of the volume of the protein preparation. When the protein is produced by chemical synthesis,, it is preferably substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals, i.e. , tt is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals which are in volved in the synthesis of the protein. Accordingly such preparations of the protein have less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, 5% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or compounds other than the -polypeptide of interest. Biologically active portions of a biomarker polypeptide include polypeptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently identical to or derived from a biomarker proicin amino acid sequence described herein, but which includes fewer amino acids than the full length protein, and exhibit at least one activity of the corresponding Mi-length protein. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the corresponding protein. A biologically active portion of a protein of the invention can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 00 or more amino acids in length. Moreover, other biologically active portions, in which other regions of the protein are deleted, can be prepared by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of the functional activities of the native form of a polypeptide of the invention. Preferred polypeptides have an amino acid sequence of a biomarker protein encoded by a nucleic acid molecule described herein. Other useful proteins are substantially identical (e.g., at least about 40%, preferably 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 83%, 85%, 88%, 90%, 1 , 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%) to one of these sequences and retain the functional activity of the protein of the corresponding naturally-occurring protein yet differ in amino acid sequence due to natural allelic variation or mutagenesis. To determine the percent identity of two amino acid se uences or of two nucleic acids, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino or nucleic acid sequence). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity = # of identical positions/total # of positions (e.g., overlapping positions) x lOO). In one embodiment the two sequences are the same length. The determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A preferred, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karii.n and Altschul (1990) Proc. NatL Acad. Set. USA 87:2264-2268, modified as in Karlin and Altschul (1993) Froc. Nad. Acad. ScL USA 90:5873-5877. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul, et al. (1990) «/. Mo Biol. 215:403-410. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the BLAST program, score - 100, wordlength - 12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score - 50, wordlength - 3 to obtain amino acid se uences homologous to a protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Aitschui et a!. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402. Alternatively- PSI-Biast can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules. When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI-B!ast programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and BLAST) can be used. See http://www.nc-bi.nlm.nai.gov. Another preferred, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller, (1988) Comp tAppl Biosci, 4: 1 1-7. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PA 120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used. Yet. another useful algorithm for identifying regions of local sequence similarity and alignment is the FASTA algorithm as described in Pearson, and Lipman (1988) Proc. Nail Acad. ScL USA 85:2444-2448. When, using the FASTA algorithm: for comparing nucleotide or amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table can, for example, be used with a A"-tuple value of 2. The percent identity between two sequences can be determined using techniques similar to those described above, with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent identity, only exact matches are counted. The invention also provides chimeric or fusion proteins corresponding to a bio-marker protein. As used herein, a "chimeric protein" or "fusion protein" comprises ail or part (preferably a biologically active part) of a polypeptide corresponding to a marker of the invention operably linked to a heterologous polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide other than the polypeptide corresponding to the marker). W tthiii the fusion protein, the term "operabl Jinked" is intended to indicate that the polypeptide of the invention and the heterologous polypeptide are fused in-frame to each other. The heterologous polypeptide can be fused to the araino-termin us or the carboxyi-teoninus of the -polypeptide of the invention. One useful fusion protein is a GST fusion protein in which a polypeptide corresponding to a marker of the invention is fused to the earboxyl terminus of GST sequences. Such fusion proteins can facilitate the purification of a -recombinant polypeptide of the invention. in another embodiment;, the fusion protein contains a heterologous signal sequence, immunoglobulin fusion protein, toxin, or other useful protein sequence. Chimeric and fusion proteins of the invention can be produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques. In another embodiment, the fusion gene can be synthesized by conventional techni ues including automated DMA synthesizers. Alternatively, PGR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers which give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments which can subsequently be annealed and re-amplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence (see, e.g., Ausubel et L. supra), Moreover, many expression vectors are commercially available that already encode a fusion moiety (e.g.s a GST polypeptide). A nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention can be cloned into such an expression vector such that the fusion moiety is linked in-frame to the polypeptide of the invention. A signal sequence can be used to facilitate secretion and isolation of the secreted protein or other proteins of interest. Signal sequences are typically characterized by a core of hydrophobic amino acids which are generally cleaved from: the mature protein during secretion in one or more cleavage events. Such signal peptides cotuain processing sites that allow cleavage of the signal sequence from the mature proteins as they pass through the secretory pathway. Thus, the invention pertains to the described polypeptides having a signal sequence, as well as to polypeptides from which the signal sequence has been proteolytically cleaved (i.e., the cleavage products), in one embodiment, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a signal sequence can be operably linked in an expression vector to a protein of interest, such as a protein which is ordinarily not secreted or is otherwise difficult to isolate. The signal sequence directs secretion of the protein, such as from a eukaryotic host into which the expression vector is transformed, and the signal sequence ts subsequently or concurrently cleaved. The protein can then be readily purified from, the extracellular medium by art recognized methods. Alternatively, the signal sequence can be linked to the protein of interest using a sequence which .facilitates purification, such as with a GS domain. The present invention also pertains to variants of the bioraarker polypeptides described herein. Such variants have an altered amino acid sequence which can function as either agonists (mimetics) or as antagonists. Variants can be generated by mutagenesis, e.g. , discrete point mutation or truncation. An agonist can retain substantially the same, or a subset, of the biological activities of the naturally occurring form of the protein. An antagonist of a protein can inhibit one or more of the activities of the naturally occurring form of the protein by, for example, competitively binding to a downstream or upstream member of a cellular signaling cascade which includes the protein of interest. Thus, specific biological effects can be elicited by treatment with a variant of limited function. Treatment of a subject with a variant having a subset of the biological acti vities of the naturally occurring form of the protein can have fewer side effects in a subject relative to treatment with the naturally occurring form of the protein. Variants of a biomarker protein which function as cither agonists (mimeties) or as antagonists can be identified by screening combinatorial libraries of mutants, e.g. , truncation mutants, of the protein of the invention for agonist or antagonist activity. In one embodiment, a variegated library of variants is generated by combinatorial mutagenesis at the nucleic acid level and is encoded by a variegated gene library. A variegated library of variants can. be produced by, for example, enzyroaticaHy ligatmg a mixture of synthetic oligonucleotides into gene sequences such that a degenerate set of potential protein sequences is expressible as individual polypeptides, or alternatively, as a set of larger fusion proteins (e.g. , for phage display). There are a variety of methods which can be used to produce libraries of potential variants of the polypeptides of the invention from a degenerate oligonucleotide sequence. Methods for synthesizing degenerate oligonucleotides are known in the art (see, e.g., Narang, 1 83, Tetrahedron 39;3; 'Hakura e.t al, \ 9M, Amw. Rev. Biache . 53:323; itakura <?/ <?/., ) 9M, Science 198: 1056; Ike et a!., 1 83 Nueteic Acid Res. 1 1 :477). in addition, libraries of fragments of the coding sequence of a polypeptide corresponding to a marker of the invention can be used to generate a variegated population of polypeptides for screening and subsequent selection of variants. For example, a library of coding se uence fragments can be generated by treating a double stranded PCR fragment of the coding sequence of interest with a nuclease under conditions wherein nicking occurs onl about once per molecule, denaturing the double stranded DM A, rcnaruring the DNA to form double stranded DNA which can include sense am sense pairs from different nicked products, removing single stranded portions from reformed duplexes by treatment with S i nuclease, and li gating the resulting fragment library into an expression vector. By this method, an expression library can be deri ved which encodes amino terminal and internal fragments of various sizes of the protein of interest. Several techniques are known in the art for screening gene products of combinatorial libraries made by point mutations or truncation, and for screening cDNA libraries for gene products having a selected property. The most widely used techniques, which are amenable to high throughput analysis, for screening large gene libraries typically include clonin the gene library into replicabSe expression vectors, transforming appropriate cells with the resulting library of vectors, and expressing the combinatorial genes under conditions in which detection of a desired activity facilitates isolation of the vector encoding the gene whose product was detected. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis (REM), a technique which enhances the frequency of functional mutants in the libraries, can be used in combination with the screening assays to identify variants of a protein of the invention (Arkin and Yourvan, 1992, Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA «9:781 1 -7815; Delgrave ef al, 1 93, Protein Engineering 6(3); 327- 331). The production and use of biomarker nucleic acid and/or biomarker polypeptide molecules described herein can be facilitated by using standard recombinant techniques. In. some embodiments, such techniques use vectors, preferably expression vectors, containing a nucleic acid encoding a biomarker polypeptide or a portion of such a polypeptide. A used herein, the term "vector" refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a "plasmid", which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments can be !igated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments can be hgared into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host ceil into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host ceil upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby arc replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors, namely expression vectors, are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operably linked. In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of piasmids (vectors). However, the present invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors, such as viral vectors (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), which serve equivalent motions. The recombinant expression vectors of die invention comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell. This means that the recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory sequences, selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, which is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Within a recombinant expression vector, "operably linked" is intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory sequeuce(s) in a manner which allows for expression of the nucleotide sequence (e.g., in an in vitro transcription translation system or in a host cell when the vector is introduced into the host cell). The term "regulatory sequence" is intended to include promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements (e.g.-, polyadenylation signals). Such regulatory sequences arc described, for example, in Gocddei, Methods in Enzymology: Gem Expression Technology vol, 185, Academic Press, San Diego, CA (1 1). Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cell and those which direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only i certain host ceils (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory sequences), it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cel l to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, and the like. The expression vectors of the invention can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce proteins or peptides, including fusion proteins or peptides, encoded by nucleic acids as described herein. The recombinant expression vectors for use in the invention can be designed for expression of a polypeptide corresponding to a marker of the invention in prokaryotic (e.g-, E. coii) or eu'fcaryotic cells (e.g., insect cells fusing bacuiovirus expression vectors} , yeast cells or mammalian cells). Suitable host ceils are discussed further in Goeddel, supra. Alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can be transcribed and translated m vitro, for example using T7 promoter regulatory sequences and 17 polymerase. Expression of proteins in prokaryotes is most often carried out in E. coll with vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters directing the expression of either fission or non-f usion proteins. Fusion vectors add a number of amino acids to a protein encoded therein, usually to the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. Such fusion vectors typically serve three purposes: 1) to increase expression of recombinant protein; 2 ) to increase the solubility of the recombinant protein; and 3) to aid in the purification of the recombinant protein by acting as a ligartd in affinity purification. Often, in fusion expression vectors, a proteolytic cleavage site is introduced at the junction of the fusion moiety and the recombinant protein to enable separation of the recombinant protein from die fusion moiety subsequent to purification of the fusion protein. Such enzymes, and their cognate recognition sequences, include Factor Xa, thrombin and enterokinase. Typical fusion expression vectors include pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech fne; Smith and Johnson, 1988, Gene 67:31 -40), pMAL (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and. pRITS (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) which fuse giutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose E binding protein, or protein A, respectively, to the target recombinant protein. Examples of suitable inducible non-fusion E. coli expression vectors include pTrc ( Amann el at , 1 88, Gem 69:30 i -315) and pET 1 1 d (Studier et l., p, 60-89, In Gem Expression Technology: Methods m Enzymo gy voi. l 85, Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1 1). Target biomarker nucleic acid expression from the p'Trc vector relies on host RNA polymerase transcription from a hybrid irp-lac fusion promoter. Target biomarker nucleic acid expression from the pET 1 .1 d vector relies on transcription from a T7 gn 10-lae fusion promoter mediated by a co-expressed viral RNA polymerase (T7 gnl). This viral polymerase is supplied by host strains BL21 (DE3) or HMS 1.?4(DE3) from a resident prophage harboring a T7 gnl gene under the transcriptional control of the iacUV 5 promoter. One strategy to maximize recombinant protein expression in E. coli is to express the protein in a host bacterium with an impaired capacity to proteofytically cleave the recombinant protein (Gottesman, p. i 19-128, In Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymohgy vol. 185, Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1990. Another strategy is to alter the nucleic acid sequence of the nucleic acid to be inserted into an expression vec tor so that the individual codons for each amino acid are those preferentially utilized in E. coli (Wada el al, 1992, Nucleic Acids Res. 20:21 1 .1 -2118). Such alteration of nucleic acid sequences of the invention can be carried out b standard D A synthesis techniques. In another embodiment, the expression vector is a yeast expression vector. Examples of vectors for expression in yeast. S. cerevisiae include pYepSec! (Baldari el al, 1987, EMBOJ, 6:229-234), pMFa (Kurjan and Herskowitz, 1982, Cell 30:933-943), pJRY88 (Schultz et al., 1 87, Gene 54: 1 13-123), pYES2 (Invitrogen Corporation, San Diego, CA), and pPicZ (invitrogen Corp, San Diego, CA). Alternatively, the expression vector is a bacitlovirus expression vector. Baculovirus vectors available for expression of proteins in cultured insect ceils (e.g. , Sf 9 cells) include the Ac series (Smith <¾ <*/., 1983, A Cell Biol 3 ;2156-2165) and the pVL series (Lucklow and Summers, 1989, Virology 170:31 -39). in yet another embodiment, a nucleic acid of the invention is expressed in mammalian ceils using a. mammalian expression vector. Examples of mammalian expression vectors include pCDMS (Seed, 1987, Nature 329:840) and pMT2PC (Kaufman ei al, I 987, EMBO . 6: 187-195). When used in mammalian ceils, the expression vector's control functions are often provided by viral regulatory elements. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma. Adenovirus 2, cytomegalovirus and Simian Vims 40. For other suitable expression systems for both prokaryotic and eukaryotie cells see chapters 1 and 1.7 of Sambrook <? al, supra. In another embodiment, the recombinant mammalian expression vector is capable of directing expression of the nucleic acid preferentially in a particular eel! type (e.g. , tissue- specific regulatory elements are used to express the nucleic acid). Tissue-specific regulatory dements are known in the art. Non-limiting examples of suitable tissue-specific promoters include the albumin promoter (liver-specific; Pinkert ei al., 1987, Genes Dev. 1 :268~277), lymphoid-specific promoters (Calame and Eaton, 1988, Adv. Immunol. 43:235- 275 ), in particular promoters of T ceil receptors (Winoto and Baltimore, 1989, EMBO J. 8:729-733) and immunoglobulins (Banerji ei a ... .1 83, Cell 33:729-740; Queen and Baltimore, 1983, Cell 33:741 -748), neuron-specific promoters (e.g., the neurofilament promoter; Byrne and Huddle, 1989, Proc. Nail Acad. Scl USA 86:5473-5477), pancreas- specific promoters (Bdlund ei al, 1985, Science 230:9! 2-916), and mammary gland- specific promoters (e.g.. milk whey promoter; U.S. Patent No. 4,873,316 and European Application Publication No. 264, 1 6). Developmentally-reguiated promoters are also encompassed, for example the murine hox promoters (Kessel and Gruss, 1990, Science 249:374-379) and the a-fetoproiein promoter (Camper and Tilghman, 1989, Genes Dev. 3:537-546). The invention further provides a recombinant expression vector comprising a DNA molecule cloned into the expression vector in an antisense orientation. That is, the DN A molecule is operably linked to a regulatory sequence in a maimer which allows for expression (by transcription of the D A molecule) of art R A molecule which is antisense to the mR'NA. encoding a polypeptide of the invention. Regulatory sequences operably linked to a nucleic acid cloned in the antisense orientation can be chosen which direct the continuous expression of the an ti sense RNA molecule in a variety of celi types, for instance viral promoters and/or enhancers, or regulatory sequences can be chosen which direct constitutive, tissue-specific or cell type specific expression of antisense RNA. The antisense expression vector can be in the form of a recombinant plasraid, phagemkl, or attenuated virus in which antisense nucleic acids are produced under the control of a high efficiency regulatory region, the activity of which can be determined by the cell type into which the vector is introduced. For a discussion of the regulation of gene expression using antisense genes (see Weint aub et a}., 1986, Trends in Genetics, Vol. .1(1)). Another aspect of the invention pertains to host cells into which a recombinant expression vector of the invention has been introduced. The terms "host cell" and ""recombinant host cell" are used interchangeably herein. It is understood that such terms refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny or potential progeny of such a ceil. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either imitation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent, ceil but are still included within the scope of the term as used herein. A host, celi can be any prokaryotic (e.g. , E, coli) or eukaryotk celi (e.g.„ insect cells, yeast or mammalian, ceils). Vector DNA can be introduced into prokaryotic or enkaryotic ceils via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. As used herein, the terms "transformation*' and "transfection" are intended to refer to a variety of art-recognized techniques for introducing foreign nucleic acid into host cell, including calcium phosphate or calcium chloride co- precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, lipofeetion, or electroporation. Suitable methods for transforming or transfecting host cells can be found in Sambrook, et ah {supra), and other laboratory manuals. For stable transfection of mammalian ceils, it is known that, depending upon the expression vector and transfection technique used, only a small frac tion of cells may integrate the foreign D A into their genome, in order to identify and select these integrants, a gene that encodes a selectable marker (e.g. , for resistance to antibiotics) is generally introduced into the host cells along with the gene of interest . Preferred selectable markers include those which confer resistance to drugs, such as G41 S, hygromycin and methotrexate. Cells stabl transfected with the introduced nucleic acid can be identified by drug selection (e.g., cells that have incorporated the selectable marker gene will survive, while the other ceils die). V. Analyzing Biornarker Nucleic Acids and Polypeptides Biornarker nucleic acids and/or biomarker polypeptide can be analyzed according to the methods described herein and techniques known to the skilled artisan, to identify such genetic or expression alterations useful for the present invention including, but not limited to, 1 ) an alteration in the level of a biomarker transcript or polypeptide, 2) a deletion or addition of one or more nucleotides from a biomarker gene, 4) a substitution of one or more nucleotides of a biomarker gene, 5) aberrant modification of a biomarker gene, such as an expression regulatory region, and the like. a. Methods for Detection of Cop Number Methods of evaluating the copy number of a biornarker nucleic acid are well known to those of skill in the art. The presence or absence of chromosomal gain or loss can be evaluated simply by a determination of copy number of the regions or markers identified herein. in one embodiment, a biological sample is tested for the presence of copy number changes in genomic loci containing die genomic marker. A copy number of at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 1.0 is predictive of poorer outcome of anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Methods of evaluating the copy number of a. biomarker locus include, but are not limited to, hybridization-based assays. Hybridization-based assays include, but are not limited to, traditional "direct probe" methods, such as Southern blots, in situ hybridization (e.g., FISH and FISH plus SKY) methods, and "comparati ve probe" methods, such as comparative genomic hybridization (COM), e.g., cDNA-based or oligomicieotide-based CGH. The methods can be used in a wide variety of formats including, but not limited to, substrate (e.g. membrane or glass) bound methods or army-based approaches. In one embodiment, evaluating the biomarker gene copy number in a sample involves a Southern Blot, In a. Southern Slot, the genomic DNA (typically fragmented and separated on an eiectrophoretic gel) is hybridized to a probe specific for the target region. Comparison of the intensity of the hybridization signal from the probe for the target region with control probe signal from analysis of normal genomic DNA (e.g., a non-amplified portion of the same or related ceil, tissue, organ, etc.) provides an estimate of the relative copy number of the target nucleic acid. Aitemati vely, a Northern blot may be utilized for evaluating the copy number of encoding nucleic acid in a sample. n a Northern blot, rnRNA is hybridized to a probe specific for the target region. Comparison of the intensity of the hybridization signal from the probe for the target region with control probe signal from analysis of normal RNA (e.g., a non-amplified portion of the same or related ceil, tissue, organ, ere.) provides an estimate of the relative copy number of the target nucleic acid. Alternatively, other methods well known in the art to detect RNA can be used, such that higher or lower expression relative to an appropriate control (e.g., a non-amplified portion of the same or related cell tissue, organ, etc.) provides an estimate of the relative copy number of the target nucleic acid. An alternative means for determining genomic copy number is in situ hybridization (e.g., Angerer (1987) Meth. Enzymol 152: 649). Generally, m situ hybridization comprises the following steps: (1) fixation of tissue or biological structure to be analyzed; (2) prcliybridization treatment of the biological structure to increase accessibility of target DNA, and to reduce nonspecific binding; (3) hybridization of the mixture of nucleic acids to the nucleic acid in the biological structure or tissue; (4) posi-iiybridizaiion washes to remove n ucleic acid fragments not bound in the hybridization and (5) detection of the hybridized nucleic acid fragments. The reagent used in each of these steps and the conditions for use vary depending on the particular application. In a typical in siiu hybridization assay, ceils are fixed to a solid support, typically a glass slide. If a nucleic acid is to be probed, the cells are typically denatured with heat or alkali. The cells are then contacted with a hybridization solution at moderate temperature to permit annealing of labeled probes specific to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein. The targets (e.g., cells) arc then typically washed at a predetermined stringency or at an increasing stringency until an appropriate signal to noise ratio is obtained. The probes are typically labeled, e.g., with radioisotopes or fluorescent reporters. In one embodiment, probes are sufficiently long so as to specifically hybridize with the target nucleic acid(s) under stringent conditions. Probes generally range in length from about 200 bases to about 1000 bases, in some applicaiiotis it is necessary to block the hybridization capacity of repetitive sequences. Thus, in some embodiments, tRNA, human genomic DNA, or Cot-I DNA is used to block non-specific hybridization. An alternative means for determining genomic copy number is comparative genomic hybridization, in general, genomic DNA is isolated from normal reference cells. as well as from test cells {e.g., tumor cells) and amplified, if .necessary. The two nucleic acids are difierentiaiiy labeled and then hybridized in situ to metaphase chromosomes of a reference cell. The repetitive sequences in both the reference and test DN As ate cither removed or their hybridization capacity is reduced by some me ns, for example by prehybridization with appropriate blocking nucleic acid and/or including such blocking nucleic acid sequences for said repetitive sequences during said hybridization. The bound, labeled DNA sequences are then rendered in a visuaiizabie form, if necessary. Chromosomal regions in the test cells which are at increased or decreased copy number can be identified by detecting regions where the ratio of signal from the two DNAs is altered. For example, those regions that have decreased in copy number in the test cells will show relatively lower signal from the test DNA. than the reference compared to other regions of the genome. Regions that have been increased in copy number in the test cells will show relati vely higher signal from the test DNA. Where there are chromosomal deletions or multiplications, differences in the ratio of the signals from the two labels will be detected and the ratio will provide a measure of the copy number. In another embodiment of CGH, army CGH iaCGH), the immobilized chromosome eiement is replaced with a eoiieciioo of solid support bound target nucleic acids on an array, alio wing for a large or complete percentage of the genome to be represented in the collection of solid support bound targets. Target nucleic acids may comprise cDNAs, genomic DNAs, oligonucleotides (e.g., to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms) and the like. Array-based CGH may also be performed with single-color labeling (as opposed to labeling the control and the possible tumor sample with two different dyes and mixing them prior to hybridization, which will yield a ratio due to competitive hybridization of probes on the arrays). In single color CGH, the control is labeled and hybridized to one array and absolute signals are read, and the possible tumor sample is labeled and hybridized to a second array (with identical content) and absolute signals are read. Copy number difference is calculated based on absolute signal from: the two arrays. Methods of preparing immobilized chromosomes or arrays and performing comparative genomic hybridization are well known in the art (see, &&, U.S. Pa Nos: 6,335, 167; 6, 197,501 ; 5,830,645; and 5,665,549 and Albertson ( 1984) EMBO J: 3: 1.227-1234: Piiikei ( 1988) Proc. Natl. Acad ScL USA 85: 91.38-9142; EFO Pub. No. 430,402; Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 33: In situ H bridization Protocols, Choo, ed., Humana Press, Totowa, J. (1 94), etc,') In another embodiment, the hybridization protocol of Pirtkel, el al. (1998) Nature Genetics 20: 207-21 1 , or of Kallioniemi (1992) Proc. Natl Acad Sci USA 89:5321 -5325 0992) is used. in still another embodiment, amplification-based assays can be used to measure copy number. In such amplification-based assays, the nucleic acid sequences act as a template in an amplification reaction (e.g., Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). In a quantitative amplification, the amount of amplification product will be proportional to the amount of template in the original sample. Comparison to appropriate controls, e.g. healthy tissue, provides a measure of the copy number. Methods of "quantitative'' amplification are well known to those of skill in the art. For example, quantitative PGR involves simultaneously co-amplifying a 'known quantity of a control sequence using the same primers. This provides an internal standard that may be used to calibrate the PCR reaction. Detailed protocols for quantitative PCR are provided in iniiis, el ah (1 90) PCR Protocols, A Guide to Methods and Applications, Academic Press, Inc. N.Y.). Measurement of DNA copy number at microsatellite loci using quantitative PCR analysis is described in Ginzonger, et al. (2000) Cancer Research 60:5405-5409. The known nucieic acid sequence for the genes is sufficient to enable one of skill in the art to routinely select primers to amplify any portion of the gene. Fluorogenie quantitative PCR may also be used in the methods of the invention, in fluorogenie quantitative PCR, quantitation is based on amount of fluorescence signals, e.g., TaqMan and SYBR green. Other suitable amplification methods include, but are not limited to, ligase chain reaction (LCR) (see W'u and Wallace (1 89) Genomics 4: 560, Landegren, el al. (3988) Science 2 1 1 77, and Barringer et al. ( 1990) Gem 89: 117), transcription amplification ( vvoh, ei iil. (1.989) Proc. Natl Acad. Set. USA 86: 1 173), self-sustained sequence replication (Guatel!i, et ai (1990) Proc. Nat Acad. Set USA 87: 1874), dot PCR, and linker adapter PCR, etc. Loss of heterozygosity (LOU) and major copy proportion (MCP) mapping (Wang, Z.C., et al. (2004) Cancer Res 64(1);64-71 ; Seymour, A. B., et al. (1994) Cancer Res 54, 2761-4; Halm, S. A„ et al. (1995) Camer Res 55, 4670-5; Kimura, M, ef al. (1996) Genes Chromosomes Cancer 17, 88-93; Li et al, (2008) MBC Biomform. 9, 204-219) may also be used to identify regions of amplification or deletion. b. Methods for Detection of Biomarker Nucleic Acid Expression Biotnarker expression may be assessed by an of a wi de variety of well known methods for detecting expression of a transcribed molecule or protein. Non-limiting examples of such methods include immunological methods for detection of secreted, cell- surface, cytoplasmic, or nuclear proteins, protein purification methods, protein function or activity assays, nucleic acid hybridization methods, nucleic acid reverse transcription methods, and nucleic acid amplification methods. in preferred embodiments, activity of a particular gene i characterized by a measure of gene transcript (e.g. mRNA), by a measure of the quantity of translated protein, or by a measure of gene product activity. Marker expression can be monitored in a variety of ways, including by detecting mRNA levels, protein levels, or protein activity, any of which can be measured using standard techniques. Detection can involve quantification of the level of gene expression (e.g., genomic A, cDNA, mRNA, protein, or enzyme activity), or, alternatively, can be a qualitative assessment of the level of gene expression, in particular in comparison with a control level. The type of level being detected will be clear from the context. In another embodiment, detecting or determining expression levels of a biomarker and functionally similar horoologs thereof, including a fragment or genetic alteration, thereof (e.g. , in regulatory or promoter regions thereof) comprises detecting or determi ing RNA levels for the marker of interest In one embodiment, one or more cells from the subject to be tested are obtained and RNA is isolated from the cells, in a preferred embodiment, a sample of breast, tissue ceils is obtained from the subject. in one embodiment, RNA is obtained from a single cell. For example, a cell can be isolated from a tissue sample by laser capture microdissection (LCM). Using this technique, a cell can be isolated from a tissue section, including a stained tissue section, thereby assuring that the desired cell is isolated (see, e.g. , Bonner et al. ( 1997) Science 278: 14 1; Emmert-Buck et al (1996) Science 274:998; Fend et al. (1999) Am, J, Path. 154: 61 and Murakami et al. (200G) Kidney int. 58: 1346). For example, Murakami et al , supra, describe isolation of a cell from a previously immunostained tissue section. it is also be possible to obtain cells from a subject and culture the cells in vitro, such as to obtain a larger population of cells from winch RNA can be extracted. Methods for establishing cultures of non-transformed cells, i.e., primary ceil cultures, are known in the art. When isolating RNA from tissue samples or ceils from individuals, it may be important to prevent any further changes in gene expression after the tissue or cells has been removed from the subject. Changes in expression levels are known to change rapidly following perturbations, .g., heat shock or activation with lipopolysaceharide (LPS) or other reagents. In addition, the RNA in the tissue and cells may quickly become degraded. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the tissue or cells obtained from a subject is snap frozen as soon as possible. RNA can be extracted from the tissue sample by a variety of methods, e.g. , the guanidiutn thiocyanaie lysis followed by CsCl centrifugation (Chirgwin et al,« 1979, Biochemistry 18:5294-5299). RNA from single cells can be obtained as described in methods for preparing cDNA libraries from single cells, such as those described in Duke, C. ( 1998) Curr. Top. Dev. Biol 36, 245 and Jena et al, (1 96) J. Immunol Methods 190; 1 9. Care to avoid RNA degradation must be taken, .g., by inclusion of RNAsin. The RNA sample can then be enriched in particular species. In one embodiment, poly(A) - RNA is isolated from the RNA sample, hi general, such purification takes advantage of the poly- A tails on tn'RNA, in particular and as noted above, poly-T oligonucleotides may be immobilized within on a solid support to serve as affinity ligands for mRNA. Kits for this purpose are commercially available, e.g., the MessageMaker kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). in a preferred embodiment the RNA population is enriched in marker sequences. Enrichment can be undertaken, e.g,, by primer-specific e'DNA synthesis, or multiple rounds of linear amplification based on cDNA synthesis and template-directed in vitro transcription (see, e.g., Wang et al. (1989) PNAS 86, 9717: Duke et al., supra, and Jena et al., supra). The population of RNA, enriched or not in particular species or sequences, can further be amplified. As defined herein, an "amplification process" is designed to strengthen, increase, or augment a molecule within the RNA. For example, where RNA is mRNA, an amplification process such as RT-PCR can be utilized to amplify the mRNA, such that a signal is detectable or detection is enhanced. Such an amplification process is beneficial particularly when the biological, tissue, or tumor sample is of a small size or volume. Various amplification and detection methods can be used. For example, it is within the scope of the present invention to reverse transcribe mRNA into cDNA followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); or, to use a single enzyme for both steps as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5322,770, or reverse transcribe mR A into cDNA followed by symmetric gap ligase chain reaction (RT-AGLCR) as described by R. L. Marshall, et al„ PCR Methods and Applications 4: 80-84 ( 1 94). Real time PCR may also be used. Other known amplification methods which can be utilized herein include but are not limited to the so-called "NASBA" or "3SR" technique described in PNAS USA 87: 1874- 1878 ( 1990) and also described in Nature 350 (No. 63.13): 91-92 (1991 ); Q-beta amplification as described in published European Patent Application (EPA) No. 4544610; strand displacement amplification (as described in G. T, Walker et at, Clin, Chem. 42: 9-13 (1996) and European Patent Application No. 6843.15; target, mediated amplification, as described by PCT Publication W09322461 ; PCR; ligase chain reaction (LCR) (see, e.g., Wu and Wallace, Genomics 4, 560 (1 89), Landegren et at, Science 241 , 1077 (1 88)); self-sustained sequence replication (SSR.) (see, e.g., Gnatelli et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 87, 1874 (1990)): and transcription amplification e.g., Kwoh et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 86, 3 173 (1989)),. Many techniques are known in the state of the art for determining absolute and relative levels of gene expression, commonly used techniques suitable for use in the present, invention include Northern analysis, RNase protection assays (RPA), mieroarrays and PCR- based techniques, such as quantitative PCR and differential display PCR, For example, Northern blotting involves running a preparation of RNA on a denaturing agarose gel, and transferring it to a suitable support, such as activated cellulose, nitrocellulose or glass or nylon membranes. Radiolabeled cD A or RNA is then hybridized to the preparation, washed and analyzed by autoradiography. In situ hybridization visualization may also be employed, wherein a radioactively labeled ami sense RNA probe is hybridized with a thin section of a biopsy sample, washed, cleaved with RNase and exposed to a sensitive emulsion for autoradiography. The samples may be stained with hematoxylin to demonstrate the histological composition of the sample, and dark field imaging with a suitable light filter shows the developed emulsion. Non-radioactive labels such as digoxigenin may also be used. Alternatively, mRNA expression can be detected on a D A array, chip or a microarray. Labeled nucleic acids of a test sample obtained from a. subject ma be hybridized to a solid surface comprising biomarker DNA. Positive hybridization signal is obtained with the sample containing biomarker transcripts. Methods of preparing DNA arrays and their use are well known in the art (see, e.g., "U.S. Pat. Nos: 6,61 ,6796; 6,379,897; 6,664,377; 6,451 ,536; 548,257; U.S. 20030157485 and Schena et al. ( 1995) Science 20, 467-470; Gerhold et al. (.1999) Trends In Biochem. ScL 24, 168-173; and Lennon et al. (2000) Drug Discovery Toa'ay 5, 59-65„ which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) can also he performed (See for example U.S. Patent Application 200302.15858). To monitor mRNA levels, for example, mRNA is extracted from the biological sample to be tested, reverse transcribed, and ffuorescentiy-labeled cD A probes are generated. The microarrays capable of hybridizing to marker cDNA are then probed with the labeled cDNA probes, the slides scanned and fluorescence intensity measured. This intensity correlates with the hybridization intensity and expression levels. Types of probes that can be used in the methods described herein include cDNA, nboprobes, synthetic oligonucleotides and genomic probes. The type of probe used will generally be dictated b the particular situation,, such as nboprobes for in situ hybridization, and cDNA for Northern blotting, for example, in one embodiment, the probe is directed to nucleotide regions unique to the NA. The probes may be as short as is required to differentially recognize marker mRNA transcripts, and may be as short as, for example, 15 bases; however, probes of at least 17, 18, 1 or 20 or more bases cart be used. In one embodiment, the primers and probes hybridize specifically under stringent conditions to a DMA. fragment having the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the -marker. As herein used, the term "stringent conditions" means hybridization will occur only if there is at least 95% identity in nucleotide sequences. I another embodiment, hybridization under "stringent conditions" occurs when there is at least 97% identity between the sequences. The form of l abeling of the probes may be any that is appropriate, such as the use of radioisotopes, for example, J"P and ">5S. Labeling with radioisotopes may be achieved, wheihef the probe is synthesized chemically or biologically, by the use of suitably labeled bases. In one embodiment, the biological sample contains polypeptide molecules from the test subject. Alternati ely, the biological sample can contain mRNA molecules from the test subject or genomic DNA molecules from, the test subject. In. another embodiment, the methods further involve obtaining a control biological sample from a control subject, contacting the co trol sample with a compound or agent capable of detecting marker polypeptide, mRNA , genomic DN A, or fragments thereof such that the presence of the marker polypeptide, mR A, genomic DM A, or fragments thereof is detected i the biological sample, and comparing the presence of the marker polypeptide. mRNA, genomic DNA, or fragments thereof, in the control sample with the presence of the marker polypeptide, mRNA,, genomic DNA, or fragments thereof in the test sample. c. Methods for Detection of Biomarker Protein Expression The activity or level of a biomarker protein can be detected and/or quantified by detecting or quantifying the expressed polypeptide. The polypeptide can be detected and quantified by any of a number of means well known to those of skill in the art. Aberrant levels of polypeptide expression of the polypeptides encoded by a biomarker nucleic acid and functionally similar homologs thereof including a fragment or genetic alteration thereof (e.g. , in regulatory or promoter regions thereof) are associated with the likelihood of response of a cancer to an anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Any method known in the art for detecting polypeptides can be used. Such methods include, but are not limited to, immunodiffusion, Immunoelectrophoresis;, radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELlSAs), immunofluorcscent assays. Western blotting, binder- ligand assays, immimohistocheniieal techniques, agglutination, complement assays, high performance liquid chromatography (HP'LC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), hyperdiff ision chromatography, and the like (e.g., Basic and Clinical Immunology, Sites and Terr, eds., Appleton and Lange, Norwalk, Conn, pp 217-262, 1 91 which is incorporated by reference). Prefen-ed are binder-ligand immunoassay methods including reacting antibodies with art epitope or epitopes and competitively displacing a labeled polypeptide or deriva ti ve thereof. For example, ELISA and RIA. procedures may be conducted such that a desired biomarker protein standard is labeled (with a radioisotope such as U5I or " S, or an assayahle enzyme, such as horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase), and, together with the unlahelled sample, brought into contact with the corresponding antibody, whereon a second antibody is used to bind the first, and radioactivity or the immobilized enzyme assayed (competitive assay). Alternatively, the biomarker protein in the sample is allowed to react with the corresponding immobilized antibody, radioisotope- or enzyme-labeled antt-biomarker proteinaniibod ts allowed to react with the system, and radioactivity or the enzyme assayed (ELISA-sandwieh assay). Other conventional methods may also be employed as suitable. The above techniques ma be conducted essentially as a "one-step" or "two-step" assay. A "one-step" assay involves contacting antigen with immobilized antibod and, without washing, contacting the mixture with labeled antibody. A "two-step" assay involves washing before contacting, the mixture with labeled antibody. Other conventional methods may also be employed as suitable. in one embodiment, a method for measuring biomarker protein levels comprises the steps of: contacting a biological specimen with an antibody or variant (e.g., fragment) thereof which selectively binds the biomarker protein, and detec ting whether said antibody or variant thereof is bound to said sample and thereby measuring the levels of the biomarker protein. Enzymatic and radiolabeling of biomarker protein and/or the antibodies may be effected by conventional means. Such means will generally include covalent Unking of the enzyme to the antigen or the antibody in question, such as by g!utaraldehyde, specifically so as not to adversely affect the activity of the enzyme, by which is meant that the enzyme must still be capable of interacting with its substrate, although it is not necessary for ail of the enzyme to be active, provided that enough remains active to permit the assay to be effected. Indeed, some techniques for binding enzyme are non-specific (such as using formaldehyde), and will only yield a proportion of active enzyme. it is usually desirable to immobilize one component of the assay system on a support, thereby allowing other components of the system to be brought into contact with the component and readily removed without laborious and time-consuming labor. It is possible for a second phase to be immobilized away from the first, but one phase is usually sufficient, it is possible to immobilize the enzyme itself on a support, but i f solid-phase enzyme is required, then this is generaUy best achieved by binding to antibody and affixing the antibody to a support, models and systems for which are well-known in the art. Simple polyethylene may provide a suitable support. Enzymes employable for labeling are not particularly limited, but may be selected from the members of the oxidase group, for example. These catalyze production of hydrogen peroxide by reaction with their substrates, and glucose oxidase is often used for tts good stability, ease of availability and cheapness, as well as the ready availability of its substrate (glucose). Activity of the oxidase may be assayed by measuring the concentration of hydrogen peroxide formed after reaction of the enzyme-labeled antibody with the substrate under controlled conditions well-known in the art. Other techniques may be used to detect biomarker protein according to a practitioner's preference based upon the present disclosure. One such technique is Western blotting (Towbiii et at., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 76:4350 (1 79)), wherein a suitably treated sample is run an an SDS-PAGE gel before being transferred to a solid support, such as a iiitToceS!itSose filter. Anti-biomarker protein antibodies (unlabeled) are then brought into contact with the support and assayed by a secondary immunological reagent, such as labeled protein A or anti-immunoglobuhn (suitable labels including % horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase). Chromatographic detection may also be used. immnnohistoehemistry may be used to detect expression of biotnarker protein, e.g. , in a biopsy sample. A suitable antibody is brought into contact with, for example, a thin layer of cells, washed, and then contacted with a second, labeled antibody. Labeling may be by fluorescent markers, enzymes, such as peroxidase, avidin, or radiolaheliing. The assay is scored visually, using microscopy. Anti- biomarker protein antibodies, such as intrabodies, ma also be used for imaging purposes, for example, to detect the presence of biomarker protein in cells and tissues of a subject. Suitable labels include radioisotopes, iodine "Ί, mI), carbon (i4C), sulphur (3SS), tritium (Ή), indium (! : 5In). and technetium (9iniTc), fluorescent labels, such as 'fluorescein and rhodaraine, and biotirt. For in vivo imaging purposes, antibodies are not detectable, as such, from outside the body, and so must be labeled, or otherwise modified, to permit detection. Markers for this purpose may be any that do not substantially interfere with the antibody binding, but which allow external detection. Suitable markers may include those that may be detected by X-radiography, NMR or MRL For X-radiographic techniques, suitable markers include any radioisotope that emits detectable radiation but that is not overtly harmful to the subject, such as barium or cesium, for example. Suitable markers for NMR and MR! generally include those with a detectable eharacieiistie spin, such as deuterium, whieh may be incorporated into the antibody by suitable labeling of nutrients for the relevant hybridoma, for example. The size of the subject;, and the imaging system used, will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of technetium- 99. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain biomarker protein. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment can then be detected using known techniques. Antibodies that may be used to detect biomarker protein include any antibody, whether natural or synthetic, full length or a fragment thereof, monoclonal or polyclonal that binds sufficiently strongly and specifically to the bioniarker protein to be detected. An antibody may have a Kd of at most about 10'¼ J G~¼ !0"SM, ,10'yM, 10"l0M, 10' HM„ 10* M. The phrase "specifically binds" refers to binding of, for example, an antibody to an epitope or antigen or antigenic determinant in such a manner that binding can be displaced or competed with a second preparation of identical or similar epitope, antigen or antigenic determinant. An antibody may bind preferentially to the biomarker protein relative to other proteins, such as related proteins. Antibodies are commercially available or may be prepared according to methods known in the art- Antibodies and derivatives thereof that may be used encompass polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, chimeric, human, humanized, primatized (CDR-grafted), veneered or single-chain antibodies as well as functional fragments, i.e.t biomarker protein binding fragments, of antibodies, for example, antibody fragments capable of binding to a biomarker protein or portions thereof including, but not limited to, Fv, Fab, Fab' and F(ab') 2 fragments can be used. Such fragme ts can be produced by enzymatic cleavage or by recombinant techniques. For example, papain or pepsin cleavage can generate Fab or F(abT) 2 fragments, respectively. Other proteases with the requisite substrate specificity can also be used to generate Fab or F(ab') 2 fragments. Antibodies can also be produced in a variety of truncated forms using antibody genes m which one or more stop codons have been introduced upstream of the natural stop site. For example, a chimeric gene encoding a F(ab') 2 heavy chain portion can be designed to include DNA sequences encoding the CH, domain and hinge region of the heavy chain. Synthetic and engineered antibodies are described in, e.g. , Cabilly et at, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 Cabilly et al., Europea Patent No. 0,125,023 Bl; Boss et al., U.S. Pat.

See also, Newman, . et al., BioTechnology, 10: 1 55-1460 ( 1992), regarding primatized antibody, arid Ladner et at., VS. Pat. No. 4,946,778 and Bird, R. E. et al, Science, 242: 423-426 ( 1988)) regarding single-chain antibodies. Antibodies produced from a library, e.g., phage display library, may also be used. In some embodiments, agents that specifically bind to a biomarker protein other than antibodies are used, such as peptides. Peptides that specifically bind to a biomarker protein can be identified by any means known in the art. For example, specific peptide binders of a biomarker protein can be screened for using peptide phage display libraries. d. Methods for Detection of Biomarker Metabolite Expression Biomarker metabolites, such as those shown in Table i can be detected in numerous ways according to well-known techniques. For example, such metabolites, as well as biomarker proteins, can be detected using mass spectrometry methods, such as MALDl TOF (dme-of-fiight), SELDI/TOF, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas ehroiuatography-niass spectrometry (GC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (rlPLC-MS), capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, or tandem mass spectrometry (eg. , MS/MS, MS/MS/MS, ESi-MS/MS, etc.). See for example, U.S. Patent Application Nos: 20030199001, 200301.34304, 20030077616, which are herein incorporated by reference. Mass spectrometry methods arc well known in the art and ha ve been used to quantify and/or identify biomolecuSes, such as chemical metabolites and proteins (sec, e.g., Li et al (2000) Tibtech 18, 151 - 160; Rowley et ai. (KM)) Methods 20, 383-397; Kuster and Mann (.1 98) Cum Opin. Structural Biol. 8, 393-400). Further, mass spectrometric techniques have been developed that permit at least partial de novo sequencing of isolated proteins (sec, e.g. , C ait et al. (1993) Science 262, 89-92; Keough et al. (3 99) Proc. Natl Acad Set USA. 96, 7131 -7136; reviewed in Bergman (2000) EXS 88, 133-44). in certain embodiments, a gas phase ion spectrophotometer is used, in other embodiments, laser-dcsorption/ionization mass spectrometry is used to analyze the sample. Modem laser desorptioiV'ionization mass spectrometry ("LD1-MS") can be practiced in two main variations; matrix, assisted laser desorption ionization ("MALDI") mass spectrometry and surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization f'SELDI"). In MALDI, the analyte is mixed with a solution containing a matrix, and a drop of the liquid is placed on the surface of a substrate. The matrix solution, then co-crystal! izes with the biological molecules. The substrate is inserted into the mass spectrometer. Laser energy is directed to the substrate surface where it desorbs and ionizes the biological molecules without significantly fragmenting them. However, MALDI. has limitations as an analytical tool, it does not provide means for fractionating the sample, and the matrix material can interfere with detection, especially for low molecular weight analytes (see, e.g., Heilenkamp et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,1 .18,937 and Beavis and Chan, U.S. Pat. No. 5,045,694). In SELD1, the substrate surface is modified so that it is an active participant in the desorption process. In one varian the surface is deri atized with adsorbe i and/or capture reagents that selectively hind the protein of interest. In another variant, the surface is deri vatized with energy absorbing molecules that are not desorbed when struck with the laser. In another variant, the surface is derivatized with molecules that bind the protein of interest and that contai a photolytic bond that is broken upon application of the laser. In each of these methods, the derivatizrag agent generally is localized to a specific location on the substrate surface where the sample is applied (see, e.g., Hutchens and Yip, U.S. Pat, No. 5,719,060 and Hutchens and Yip, WO 98/59361 ). The two methods can be combined by, for example, using a SELDI affinity surface to capture an anaiyte and adding matrix- containing liquid to the captured anaiyte to provide the energy absorbing material For additional information regarding mass spectrometers, see, e.g.t Principles of instrumental Analysis, 3rd edition., Skoog, Saunders College Publishing, Philadelphia, 1 85; and irk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4.sup.th ed. Vol. 15 (John Wiley & Sons, New York 1995), pp. 1071-1094. Detection of the presence of a marker or other substances will typically involve detection of sianal intensitv. For example, in certain embodiments, the signal strength of peak values from spectra of a first sample and a second sample can be compared (e.g., visually or by computer analysis) to determine the relative amounts of particular biomolecules. Software programs such as the Biomarker Wizard program (Ciphergeii Biosvstems, Inc., Fremont, Calif.) can be used to aid in analyzing mass spectra. The mass spectrometers and their techniques are well known to those of skill in the art. Any person skilled in the art understands, any of the components of a mass spectrometer (e.g., desorption source, mass analyzer, detect, etc.) and varied sample preparations can be combined with other suitable components or preparations described herein, or to those known in the art. For example, in some embodiments a control sample may contain heavy atoms (e.g. ! 'C) thereby permitting the test sample to be mixed with the known control sample in the same mass spectrometry run. in some embodiments, internal controls, such as phenylalanme-dS and/or valine-dS can he run with the samples. In one embodiment, a laser desorption time-of-fhght (TOF) mass spectrometer is used. In laser desorption mass spectrometry, substrate with a bound marker is introduced into an inlet system. The marker is desorbed and ionized into die gas phase by laser from the ionization source. The ions generated are collected by an ion optic assembly, and then in a tirne-of-fliglrt mass analyzer, ions arc accelerated through a short high voltage field and let drift into a high vacuum chamber. At the far end of the high vacuum chamber, the accelerated tons strike a sensitive detector surface at a different time. Since the tirae-of- fiight is a function of the mass of the ions, the elapsed time between ion formation and ion detector impact can be used to identify the presence or absence of molecules of specific mass to charge ratio. hi some embodiments the relative amounts of one or more biomoleeules present in a first or second sample is determined, in part, by executing an algorithm with a programmable digital computer. The algorithm identifies at least one peak value in the first mas spectrum and the second mass spectrum. The algorithm then compares the signal strength of the peak value of the first mass spectrum to the signal strength of the peak value of the second mass spectrum of the ma ss spec trum. The relative signal strengths are an indication of the amount of the biomolecule that is present in the first and second samples. A standard containing a known amoun t of a biomolecule can be analyzed as the second sample to provide better quantification of the amount of the biomolecule present in the first sample. In certain embodiments, the identity of the biomoleeules in the first and second sample can also be determined. e. Methods for Detection of Biornarker Structural Alterations The following illustrative methods can be used to identify the presence of a structural alteration in a biornarker nucleic acid and/or biornarker polypeptide molecule in order to. for example, identify oncogene biomarkers (e.g., activating mutations in oncogene biomarkers) and tumor suppressor biomarkers (e.g., inhibiting mutations in tumor suppressors). In certain embodiments, defection of the alteration involves the use of a probe/primer in a polymerase chain reaction (PCS (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,1 5 and 4,683,202), such as anchor PGR or RACE PGR, or, alternatively, in a ligation chain reaction (LCR) (see, e.g., Landegran et l ( 1988.) Science 241 :1077- 1080; and Naka awa ef al. ( 1994) Proe. Natl. Acad. Set. US A 91 :360-364), the latter of which can be particularly useful for detecting point mutations in a biornarker nucleic acid such as a biornarker gene (see Abravaya et l (1 95) Nucleic Acids Res, 23:675-682). "This method can include the steps of collecting a sample of ceils from a subject, isolating nucleic acid (e.g., genomic, mRNA or both) from the cells of the sample, contacting the nucleic acid sample with one or more primers which specifically hybridize to a biomarker gene under conditions such that hybridization arid amplification of the biomarker gene (if present) occurs, and detecting the presence or absence of an amplification product, or detecting the size of the amplification product and comparing the length to a control sample. It is anticipated that PCR and/or LCR may be desirable to use as a preliminary amplification step in conjunction with any of the techniques used for detecting mutations described herein. Alternative amplification methods include: self sustained sequence replication (Guatelli, I C. et at. ( 1.990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 1874- 18781 transcriptional amplification system (Kwoh, D, Y. ei at. (1989) Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:1173- 1 177), Q-Beta epticase (Lizard! . P. M. et al (1988) Bio-Technology 6: 1 197), or any other nucleic acid amplification method, followed by the detection of the amplified molecules using techniques well known to those of skill in the art. These detection schemes are especially useful for the detection of nucleic acid molecules if such molecules are present in very low numbers. in an alternative embodiment mutations in a biomarker nucleic acid from a sample ceil can be identified by alterations in restriction enzyme cleavage patterns. For example, sample and control DNA is isolated, amplified {optionally), digested with one or more restriction endonucleases, and fragment length sizes are determined b gel electrophoresis and compared. Differences in fragment length size between sample and control DNA indicates mutations in the sample DNA. Moreover, the use of sequence specific ribozymes (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,531 ) can be used to score for the presence of specific mutations by development or loss of a ribozyme cleavage site. in other embodiments, genetic mutations in biomarker nucleic acid can be identified by hybridizing a sample and control nucleic acids, e.g. , DNA or RNA, to high density arrays containing hundreds or thousands of oligonucleotide probes (Cronin, M. T. ei ai. (1 96) Hum. Mutat. 7:244-255; Kozal, M J. ei ai ( 1996) Nat. Med. 2:753-759). For example, biomarker genetic mutations can be identified in two dimensional arrays containing light-generated DNA probes as described in Cronin et al (1 96) supra. Briefly, a first hy bridization array of probes can be used to scan through long stretches of DNA in a sample and control to identify base changes between the sequences by making linear arrays of sequential, overlapping probes. This step allows the identification of point mutations. This step is followed by a second hybridization array that allows the characterization of specific mutations by -using smaller,, specialized probe arrays complementary to all variants or mutations detected. Each mutation array is composed of parallel probe sets, one complementary to the wild-type gene and the other complementary to the mutant gene. Such biomarker genetic mutations can be identified in a variety of contexts, including, for example; germline and somatic mutations. In yet another embodiment, any of a variety of sequencing reactions known in the art can be used to directly sequence a biomarker gene and detect mutations by comparing the sequence of the sample biomarker with the corresponding wild-type (control) sequence. Examples of sequencing reactions include those based on techniques developed by Maxara and Gilbert (1 7?) Proc. Nad. Acad, Set. USA 74:560 or Sanger (1977) Proc. Naif. Acad Set USA 74:5463. it is also contemplated that any of a variety of automated sequencing procedures can be utilized when performing the diagnostic assays ( aeve (1 95) Biolechniq es 19:448-53), including sequencing by mass spectrometry (see, e.g., PCX International Publication No. WO 94/16101: Cohen et ai. ( 1996) Adv. Chro atogr. 36:127- 162; and Griffin et al. ( 1993) Appl Bioc em. Biofechnol. 38: 147-159). Other methods for detecting mutations in a biomarker gene include methods in which protection from cieavage agents is used to detect mismatched bases in RNA/R A or RNA/DNA heteroduplex.es (Myers ei al. ( 1985) Science 230: 1242). in general the art technique of "mismatch cleavage" starts by providing heteroduplexes formed by hybridizing (labeled.) RNA or DNA containing the wild-type biomarker sequence with potentially mutant RNA or DNA obtained from a tissue sample. The double-stranded duplexes are treated with an agent which cleaves single-stranded regions of the duple such as which will exist due to base pair mismatches between the control and sample strands. For instance, RNA/DNA duplexes can be treated with RNase and DNA/DNA hybrids treated with SI nuclease to enzymatically digest the mismatched regions. Jn other embodiments, either DNA DNA or RNA/DNA duplexes can be treated with hydroxylamine or osmium tetroxide and with piperidine in order to digest mismatched regions. After digestion of the mismatched regions, the resulting material is then separated by size on denaturing polyacrylamide gels to determine t he site of mutation. See, for example. Cotton ei al ( 1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sei. US A 85:4397 and Saleeba et al. { 1 92) Methods Enzymol. 217:286-295, In a preferred embodiment; the control DNA or RNA can be labeled for detection. in still another embodiment, the mismatch cleavage reaction employs one or more proteins that recognize mismatched base pairs in double-stranded DNA (so called "DNA mismatch repair" enzymes) in defined systems for detecting and mapping point mutations in biomarker cDNAs obtained from samples of cells. For example, the mutY enzyme of E. call cleaves A at G/A mismatches and the thymidine DNA glycosylase from HeLa ceils cleaves T at G T mismatches (Hsu et ai. (1994) Carcinogenesis 15:1657-1662). According to an exemplary embodiment, a probe based on a biomarker sequence, e.g., a wild-type biomarker treated with a DNA mismatch repair enzyme, and the cleavage products, if any, can be detected from electrophoresis protocols or the like (e.g.. U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,039.) in other embodiments, alterations in eiectrophoretic mobility can be used to identit tnutations in biomarker genes. For example, single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) may be used to detect differences in eiectrophoretic mobility between mutant and wild type nucleic acids (Orita ei at. (1989) Prac Nail Acad. Sci USA. 86:2766; sec also Cotton (1993) Mui t. Res. 285: 125-144 and Rayashi (1992) Genet. Anal Tech. Appl. 9:73- 79). Single-stranded DNA fragments of sample and control biomarker nucleic acids will be denatured and allowed to renature. The secondary structure of single-stranded nucleic acids varies according to sequence, the resulting alteration in eiectrophoretic mobility enables the detection of even, a single base change. The .D A fragments may be labeled or detected with labeled probes. The sensitivity of the assay may be enhanced by using RNA (rather than DNA), in which the secondary structure is more sensitive to a change in sequence, in a preferred embodiment, the subject method utilizes heter dup!ex analysis to separate double stranded heterodaplex molecules on the basis of changes in eiectrophoretic mobility (Keen ef ai. (.1 1) Trends Genet. 1:5). in yet another embodiment the movement of mutant or wild-type fragments in polyacrylamide gels containing a gradient of denaturant is assayed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (Myers et ai. (1 85) Nature 313:495). When DGGE is used as the method of analysis, DNA will be modified to ensure that it does not completely denat ure, for ex ample by adding a GC ciamp of approximately 40 bp of high- melting GC-rich DM A b PCR., in a further embodiment, a temperature gradient is used in place of a denaturing gradient to identify differences in the mobility of control and sample DNA (Rosenbaura and Reissner (1987) Biophys. Chem, 265: 12753). Examples of other techniques for detecting point mutations include, but are not limited to, selective oligonucleotide hybridization, selective amplification, or selective primer extension. For example, oligonucleotide primers may be prepared in which the known imitation is placed centrally and then hybridized to target DNA under conditions which permit hybridization only if a perfect match is found (Saiki el ai (1986) Nature 324:163; Saiki ei al. (.1 89) Pmc. Natl. Acad. Set (MA 86:6230). Such allele specific oligonucleotides are hybridized to PGR amplified target DNA or a number of different imitations when the oligonucleotides are attached to the hybridizing membrane and hybridized with labeled target DNA. Alternatively, allele specific amplification technology which depends on selective PGR amplification may be used in conjunction with the instant invention. Oligonucleotides used as primers for specific amplification may cany the mutation of interest in the center of the molecule (so that amplification depends on differential hybridization) (Oibbs et al. (1989) Nucleic Ackis Res. 1 7:2437-2448) or at the extreme 3' end of one primer where, under appropriate conditions, mismatch can prevent, or reduce polymerase extension (Prossner ( 1993) Tibtech 1 1 :23S). In addition it may be desirable to introduce a novel restriction site in the region of the mutation to create cleavage-based detection (Gasparini ef ai. (1 92) Μ ί Ceil Probes 6: 1 ). it is anticipated that in certain embodiments amplification may also be performed using Taq ligase for amplification (Barany ( 1 1 ) Proc. Ναιί, Acad. Sei USA 88:189). In such cases, ligation will occur only if there is a perfect match at the 3' end of the 5' sequence making it possible to detect the presence of a known raittation at a specific site by looking for the presence or absence of amplification. 3. Anti-Cancer Therapies and Combinatio Therapies The efficacy of anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is predicted according to biomarker amount and/or activity associated with a cancer in a subject according to the methods described herein, in one embodiment, such anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy or combinations of therapies (e.g., anti-PD-1 , anti-PD-Ll , a ti-PD-L2, and anti- CTLA4 therapies) can be administered once a subject is indicated as being a likely responder to anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, in another embodiment, such anti- immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy can be avoided once a subject is indicated as not being a likely responder to anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and an alternative treatment regimen, such as targeted and/or untargeted anti-cancer therapies can be administered. Combination therapies are also contemplated and can comprise, for example, one or more chemotherapeutie agents and radiation, one or more chemotherapeutie agents and immunotherapy, or one or more chem herapeutic agents, radiation and chemotherapy, each combination of which can he with or without ami-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The term '"targeted therapy" refers to administration of agents that selectively interact with a chosen hiomoleeule to thereby treat cancer.. immunotherapy is one form of targeted therapy that may comprise, for example, the use of cancer vaccines and/or sensitized antigen presenting cells, for cxampie, an oncolytic vims is a virus that is able to infect and lyse cancer cells, while leaving normal ceils unharmed, making them potentially useful in cancer therapy. Replication of oncolytic viruses both facilitates tumor ceil destruction and also produces dose amplification at the tumor site. They may also act as vectors for anticancer genes, allowing them to be specifically delivered to the turaor site. The immunotherapy can involve passive Immunity for short-term protection of a host, achieved by the administration of pre-formed antibody directed against a cancer antigen or disease antigen (e.g., administration of a monoclonal antibody, optionally linked to a chemotherapeutic agent or toxin, to a tumor antigen). For example, anti-V'EGF and raTOR inhibitors are known to be effective in treating renal eel! carcinoma, Immunotherapy can also focus on using the cytotoxic lymphocyte-recognized epitopes of cancer eel! lines. Alternatively, antisense polynucleotides, ribozymes, RNA interference molecules, triple helix polynucleotides and the like, can be used to selecti vely modulate biomolecules that are linked to the initiation, progression, and/or pathology of a rumor or cancer. The term "on targeted therapy" referes to administration of agents that do not selectively interact with a chosen biomolecule yet treat cancer. Representative examples of untargeted therapies include, without limitation, chemotherapy, gene therapy, and radiation therapy. In one embodiment, chemotherapy is used. Chemotherapy includes the administration of a chemotherapeutic agent. Such chemotherapeutic agent may be, but is not limited to, those selected from among the following groups of compounds: platinum compounds, cytotoxic antibiotics, aniimeiaboJities, antt-nittofic agents, alkylating agents, arsenic compounds, DNA topoisomerase inhibitors, taxanes, nucleoside analogues, plant alkaloids, and toxins; and synthetic derivatives thereof. Exemplary compounds include, but are not limited to, alkylating agents: eispiafiti, treosulfan, and trofosfamide; plant alkaloids: vinblastine, paciitaxel, docetaxoi; DNA topoisomerase inhibitors: teniposide, crisnatof and mitomycin; anti-i lates: methotrexate, mycophenolic acid, and hydroxyurea; pyrimidine analogs; 5-fluorouracil, doxifl uridine, and cytosine arabinoside; purine analogs: mercaptopurine and thioguanine; DNA antimetabolites: 2'-deoxy-5-fluot uridme, aphidicolm giyeinate, and pyrazoloi idazole; and antimitotic agents: halichondrin, colchicine,, and rhizoxin. Compositions comprising one or more chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., FLAG, CHOP) may also be used, FLAG comprises fludarabine, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and G-CSF, CHOP comprises cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone. In another embodiments, PARP (e.g. , PARP- ί and/or PARP-2) inhibitors are used and such inhibitors are well known in the art (e.g., Oiaparib, ABT-888, BSf-201 , BGP-15 (N-Gene Research Laboratories, inc.); INO-100I (Inotek Pharmaceuticals inc.); P 4 (Soriano et al, 2001 ; Paeher et aL, 2002b); 3-aminobenzamide (Trevigen); 4-amino- I .,8-naphthaliraide; (Trevigen); 6(5H)~phenanthridinone (Trevigen); benzamide (U.S. Pat. Re. 36,397); and U 1025 (Bowman et at). The mechanism of action is generally related to the ability of PARP inhibitors to bind FAR? and decrease its activity, PARP catalyzes the conversion of .beta. -nicotinamide adenine dinueleotide (NAD+) into nicotinamide and poly-ADP-rihose (PAR), Both po!y (ADP-ribose) and PARP have been linked to regulation of transcription, cell proliferation, genomic stability, and carcinogenesis (Bouchard V. i. et.al. Experimental Hematology, Volume 1, 'Number 6, June 2003, pp. 446-454(9); Heroes Z.; Wane Z.-Q. Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis, Volume 477, Number 1 , 2 Jan. 2001, pp. 97-1 10(14)). Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARF l) is a key molecule in the repair of DNA single- strand breaks (SSBs) (tie Murcia J. et al. 1997. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:7303-7307; Schreiber V, Dan&er F, Ame J C, de Murcia G (2006) Nat Rev Mol Ceil Biol 7:517-528; Wang Z Q, et al. (1997) Genes Dev 11:2347-2358). Knockout of SSB repair by inhibition of PARP 1 function induces DN A double-strand breaks (DSBs) that can trigger synthetic lethality in cancer cells with defective homology-direcied DSB repair (Bryant H E, el al. (2005) Nature 434:913-917: Farmer H, et al. (2005) Nature 434:917-921). The foregoing examples of chemotherapeutic agents are illustrative, and are not intended to be limiting. In another embodiment, radiation therapy is used. The radiation used in radiation therapy can be ionizing radiation. Radiation therapy can also be gamma rays. X-rays, or proton beams. Examples o -radiation therap include, but are not limited to, external -beam, radiation therapy, interstitial implantation of radioisotopes (1-125, palladium, iridium), radioisotopes such as strontium-89, thoracic radiation therapy, intraperitoneal P-32 radiation therapy, and/or total abdominal and pelvic radiation therapy. For a genera! overview of radiation therapy, see Hellrnan, Chapter 16: Principles of Cancer Management: Radiation Therapy, 6th edition, 200 i, DeVita et at, eds., 3, B. Lippencoit Company, Philadelphia. The radiation therapy can be administered as external beam radiation or 5 teletherapy wherein the radiation is directed from a remote source. The radiation treatraetu can also be administered as internal therapy or brachytherapy wherein a radioactive source is placed inside the body close to cancer ceils or a tumor mass. Also encompassed is the use of photodynaroie therapy comprising the administration of photosensitizers, such as hematoporphyrin and its derivatives, Vertoporfm (BPD-MA), phthalocyanhie, it) photosensitizer Pc4, deniethoxy-hypocrellin A; and 2BA-2-D HA. In another embodiment, hormone therapy is used. Hormonal therapeutic treatments can comprise, for example, hormonal agonists, hormonal antagonists (e.g., flutamide, bfcalutamide, tamoxifen, raloxifene, ieupro!ide acetate (LUP O ), LH-RH antagonists), inhibitors of hormone biosynthesis and processing, and steroids (e.g. , dexametl asorte, 15 retinoids, deltoids, betamethasone, Cortisol, cortisone, prednisone, dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, estrogen, testosterone, progestins), vitamin A derivatives (e.g. , all-trans retraoie acid (ATRA)); vitamin D3 analogs; antigestagens (e.g., mifepristone, onapristone), or antiandrogens (e.g., cyproterone acetate), in another embodiment, hyperthermia, a procedure in which body tissue is exposed 20 to high temperatures (up to 106*F.) is used. Heat may help shrink tumors by damaging cells or depri ing them of substances they need to live. Hyperthermia therapy can be local, regional, and whole-body hyperthermia, using external and internal heating devices. Hyperthermia is almost always used with other forms of therapy (e.g., radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and biological therapy) to try to increase their effectiveness. Local 25 hyperthermia refers to heat that is appl ied to a very small area, such as a rumor. The area may be heated externally with high-frequency waves aimed at a tumor from a device outside the body . To achieve internal heating, one of se veral types of sterile probes may be used, including thin, heated wires or hollow tubes filled with- warm water: implanted microwave antennae; and radiofreqtiency electrodes, in regional hyperthermia, an organ or 0 a limb is heated. Magnets and devices that produce high energy are placed over the region to be heated. In another approach, called perfusion, some of the patient's blood is removed, heated, and then pumped (perfused) into the region that is to be heated internally. Whole- body heating is used to treat metastatic cancer that lias spread throughout the body, it can be accomplished using warm-water blankets, hot wax, inductive coils (like those in electric blankets),, or thermal chambers (similar to iarge incubators). Hyperthermia does not cause any market! increase in radiation side effects or complications. Heat applied directly to the skin, however, can cause discomfort or even significant local pain in about half the patients treated, it can also cause blisters, which generally heal rapidly. ia still another embodiment, photodynamic therapy (also called PDT, photoradiation therapy, phototherapy, or photochemotherapy) is used for the treatment of some types of cancer. It is based on the discover}' that certain chemicals known as photosensitizing agents can kill one-celled organisms when the organisms are exposed to a particular type of light PDT destroys cancer cells through the use of a fixed-frequency laser light in combination with a photosensitizing agent, in PDT, the photosensitizing agent is injected into the bloodstream and absorbed by ceils all over the body. The agent remains in cancer cells for a longer time than it does in normal cells. When the treated cancer cells arc exposed to laser light, the photosensitizing agent absorbs the light and produces an active form of oxygen that destroys the treated cancer cells. Light exposure must he timed carefully so that it occurs whe most of the photosensitizing agent as left healthy cells hut is still present in the cancer cells. The laser Sight used in PDT can be directed through a fiberoptic (a very thin glass strand). The fiber-optic is placed close to the cancer to deliver the proper amount of light. The fiber-optic can be directed through a bronchoscope into the lungs for the treatment of lurtg cancer or through an endoscope into the esophagus for the treatment of esophageal cancer. An advantage of PDT is that it causes minimal damage to healthy tissue. However, because the laser light currently in use cannot pass through more than about 3 centimeters of tissue (a iittie more than one and an eighth inch), PDT is mainl used to treat tumors on or just under the skin or on the lining of internal organs, Photodynamic therapy makes the skin and eyes sensitive to light for 6 weeks or more after treatment. Patients are advised to avoid direct sunlight and bright indoor light for at least 6 weeks. If patients must go outdoors, they need to wear protective clothing, including sunglasses. Other temporary side effects of PDT are related to the trea tment of specific areas and can include coughing, trouble swallowing, abdominal pain, and painful breathing or shortness of breath. In December 1995, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; (FDA) approved a photosensitizing agent called porfiraer sodium, or Phoi»frin¾ to relieve symptoms of esophageal cancer that is causing an obstruction and for esophageal cancer that cannot be satisfactorily treated with lasers alone. In January 1 98, the FDA approved porfimer sodium for the treatment of early nonsmali cell lung cancer in patients for whom the usual treatments for lung cancer are not appropriate. The National Cancer institute and other institutions are supporting clinical trials (research studies) to evaluate the use of photodynamie therapy for several types of cancer, including cancers of the bladder, brain, larynx, and oral cavity. ia yet another embodiment, laser therapy is used to harness high-intensity light to destroy cancer cells. This technique is often used to relieve sy mptoms of cancer such as bleeding or obstruction, especially when the cancer cannot be cured by other treatments. It may also be used to treat cancer by shrinking or destroying tumors. Tire term "laser" stands for light amplification ¾y stimulated emission of radiation. Ordinary Sight, such as that from a light bulb, has many wavelengths and spreads in all directions. Laser light, on the other hand, has specific wavelength and is focused in a narrow beam. This type of high- intensity light contains a lot of energy. Lasers arc very powerful and may be used to cut through steel or to shape diamonds. Lasers also can be used for very precise surgical work, such as repairing a damaged retina in the eye or cutting through tissue (in place of a scalpel). Although there are several different kinds of lasers, only three kinds have gained wide use in medicine; Carbon dioxide (CO;?) laser— This type of laser can remove thin layers from the skin's surface without penetrating the deeper layers. This technique is particularly useful in treating tumors that have not spread deep into the skin and certain precancerous conditions. As an alternative to traditional scalpel surgery, the CO? laser is also able to cut the skin. The laser is used in this way to remove skin cancers. Neodynrium-ytirium-aittniinuni-ganiei (Nd.:YAG) laser- Light from this laser can penetrate deeper into tissue than light from the other type of lasers, and it can cause blood to clot quickly. It can be carried through optical fibers to less accessible parts of the body. This type of laser is sometimes used to treat throat cancers. Argon laser— This laser can pass through only superficial layers of tissue and is therefore useful in dermatology and in eye surgery, it also is used with light-sensitive dyes to treat tumors in a procedure known as photodynamie therapy (PDT). Lasers have several advantages over standard surgical tools, including; Lasers are more precise than scalpels. Tissue near an incision is protected, since there is little contact with surrounding skin or other tissue. The heat produced by lasers sterilizes the surger site, thus reducing the risk of infection. Less operating time may be needed because the precision of the laser allows for a smaller incision. Healing time is often shortened; since laser heat seals blood vessels, there is less bleeding, swelling, or scarring. Laser surgery may be less complicated. For example,, with Fiber optics, laser light can be directed to parts of the body without making a large incision. More procedures may be done on an outpatient basis. Lasers can be used in two ways to treat cancer; by shrinking or destroying a tumor with heat, or by activating a chemical— known as a photosensitizing agent—that destroys cancer ceils. In PDT, a photosensitizing agent is retained in cancer cells and can be stimulated by light to cause a. reaction that kills cancer cells. CO2 and Nd;YAO lasers are used to shrink or destroy tumors. They may be used with endoscopes, tubes that allow physicians to see into certain areas of the body, such as the bladder. The light from some lasers can he transmitted through a flexible endoscope fitted with fiber optics. This allows physicians to see and work in parts of the body that could not otherwise be reached except by surgery and therefore allows very precise aiming of the laser beam. Lasers also may be used with low-power microscopes, giving the doctor a clear view of the site being treated. Used with other instruments, laser systems can produce a cutting area as small as 200 microns in diameter-less than the width of a very fine thread. Lasers are used to treat many types of cancer. Laser surgery is a standard treatment for certain stages of glottis ( vocal cord), cervical, skin, lung, vaginal, vul var, and penile cancers. In addition to its use to destroy the cancer, laser surgery is also used to help relieve symptoms caused by cancer (palliative care). For example, lasers may be used to shrink or destroy a tumor that is blocking a patient's trachea (windpipe), making it easier to breathe, it is also sometimes used for palliation in colorectal and anal cancer. Laser- induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) is one of the most recent developments in laser therapy. LSTT uses the same idea as a cancer treatment called hyperthermia; that heat may help shrink tumor by damaging cell or depriving them of substances they need to live. In this treatment, lasers are directed to interstitial areas (areas between organs) in the body. The laser light then raises the temperature of the tumor, which damages or destroys cancer cell . The duration and/or dose of treatment with anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies may vary according to the particular anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor agent or combination thereof (e.g. , atiti-ARGi agents like small molecule Inhibitors in combination with inhibitors of ΡΌ- Ϊ , P'D-Ll, PD-L2, CTLA.-4, and the like). An appropriate treatment time for a particular cancer therapeutic agent wili be appreciated by the skilled artisan. The invention contemplates the continued assessment of optimal treatment schedules for each cancer therapeutic agent, where the phenotype of the cancer of the subject as determined by - no - the methods of the invention is a factor ie determining optimal treatment doses and schedules. Any means for the introduction of a -polynucleotide into mammals, human or non- human, or cells thereof may be adapted to the practice of this invention for the delivery of the various consintcts of the invention into the intended recipient, in one embodiment of the invention, the DNA constructs are delivered to ceils by transaction, i.e., by delivery of $ naked" DNA or in a complex with a colloidal dispersion system. A colloidal system includes macrorooleeule complexes, nanoeapsules, microspheres, beads, and lipid-based systems including oi!-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, and liposomes. The preferred colloidal system of this invention is a lipid-complexed or liposome-formulated DNA. In the former approach, prior to formulation of DNA, e.g., with lipid, plasmid containing a transgene bearing the desired DNA constructs may first be experimentally optimized for expression (e.g., inclusion of an intron in the 5' untranslated region and elimination, of unnecessary sequences (Feigner, ct aL, Ann NY Acad Sci 126- '! 39, 1995). Formulation of DNA, e.g. with various lipid or liposome materials, may then be effected using know methods arid -materials and delivered to the -recipient mammal. See, e.g., Canonico et aL Am J Rcspir Cell Mol Biol 10:24-29, 1994; Tsan et aL Am .1 Physiol 268; Alton et at, Nat Genet. 5: 135-142, 1 93 and U.S. patent No. 5,679,647 by Carson et aL The targeting of liposomes can be classified based on anatomical and mechanistic factors. Anatomical classification is based on the level of selectivity, for example, organ- specific, cell-specific, and organelle-specific. Mechanistic targeting can be distinguished based upon whether it is passive or active. Passive targeting utilizes the natural tendency of liposomes to distribute to cells of the reticulo-endothehal system (RES) in organs, which contain sinusoidal capillaries. Active targeting, on the other hand, involves alteration of the liposome by coupling the liposome to a. specific iigand such as a. monoclonal antibody, sugar, glycolipid, or protein, or by changing the composition or size of the liposome in order to achieve targeting to organs and cell types other than the naturally occurring sites of localization. The surface of the targeted delivery system may be modified in a variety of ways, in the case of a liposomal targeted delivery system, lipid groups can be incorporated into the lipid bilayer of the liposome in order to maintain the targeting Iigand in stable association with the liposomal bilayer. Various linking groups can be used for joining the - H i - lipid chains to the targeting l.igand. Naked DNA or DNA associated with a delivery vehicle, e.g., liposomes, can he administered to several sites in a subject (see below). Nucleic acids can be deli vered in any desired vector. These include viral or non- viral vectors, including adenovirus vectors, adeno-assoeiate virus vectors, retrovirus vectors, lentivirus vectors, and piasmid vectors. Exemplars' type of viruses include HSV (herpes simplex virus), AAV fadeno associated virus), H V (human immunodeficiency virus), B1V (bovine immunodeficiency virus), and MLV (murine leukemia vims). Nucleic acids can be administered in any desired format that provides sufficiently efficient delivers' levels, including in virus particles, in liposomes, in nanopartie!es, and completed to polymers. The nucleic acids encoding a protein or nucleic acid of interest may be in a piasmid. or viral vector, or other vector as is known in the art. Such vectors are well known and an can be selected for a particular application. In one embodiment of the invention, the gene delivery vehicle comprises a promoter and a demethylase coding sequence. Preferred promoters are tissue-specific promoters and promoters which are activated by cellular proliferation, such as the thymidine kinase and thymidilate synthase promoters. Other preferred promoters include promoters which are activatable by infection with a virus, such a the a- and β-interferon promoters, and promoters which are activatable by a hormone, such as estrogen. Other promoter which can be used include the Moloney virus LTR, the CMV promoter, and the mouse albumin promoter, A promoter may be constitutive or inducible. in another embodiment, naked polynucleotide molecules are used as gene delivery vehicles, as described in WO 90/1 .1092 and U.S. Patent 5,580,859. Such gene delivery vehicles can be either growth factor DNA or RNA and, in certain embodiments, are linked to killed adenovirus. Curie! et al., Hum. Gene. Ther. 3: 147- 154, 1992. Other vehicles which can optionally be used include D A-ligand (Wit et al, J. Biol. Chem. 264:16985- 16987, 1989), hpid-DNA combinations (Feigner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7413 741.7, 1989), liposomes (Wang et ai„ Proc, "Natl. Acad. Sot. 84:7851-7855, 1987) and niteroprojeetiies (Williams et al., Proc, Natl. Acad. Set. 88:2726-2730, 1991). A gene delivery vehicle can optionally comprise viral sequences such as a viral origin of replication or packaging signal. These viral sequences can be selected from viruses such as asfrovirus, corona vims, orthomyxovirus, papovavirus, paramyxovirus, parvovirus, picornavirus, poxvirus, retrovirus, togavirus or adenovirus. In a preferred embodiment, the growth factor gene delivery vehicle is a recombmant retroviral vector. Recombinant retroviruses and variou uses thereof have been described in numerous references including, for example, Mann et al., Cell 33: 153, 1983, Cane and Mulligan, Proe. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 81 :6349, .1 84, Miller et al. Human Gene Therapy 1 :5-l 4, 1 90, U.S. Patent Nos, 4,405,712, 4,861,7.5 . and 4,980,289, and POT Application Nos. WO 89 02,468, WO 89/05,349, and WO 90/02,806. Numerous retroviral gene delivery vehicles can be utilized in the present invention, including for example those described in EP 0,41 ,731 ; WO 90/07936; WO 94/03622; WO 93/25698; WO 93/25234; U.S. Patent No. 5,219,740; WO 931 1230; WO 9310218; Vile and Hart, Cancer Res. 53:3860-3864, 1993; Vile and Hart, Cancer Res. 53:962-967, 1993; Ram et al.. Cancer Res. 53:83-88, 1993; Takamiya et al., J. Neurosci. Res. 33:493-503, 1992; Baba ei al., J. Neurosurg. 79:729-735. 1993 (U.S. Patent No. 4,777,127, OB 2,200,651, EP 0,345,242 and W0 1/02805). Other viral vector systems that can be used to deliver a polynucleotide of the invention have been derived from herpes virus, e.g., Herpes Simplex Virus (U.S. Patent No. 5,631 ,236 by Woo et al, issued May 20, 1997 and WO 00/08191 by Neurovex), vaccinia virus (Ridge way (1988) Ridge way, "Mammalian expression vectors," In: Rodriguez R L, Denhardt D T, ed. 'Vectors: A survey of molecular cloning vectors and their uses. Stonehara; Bittterworth, Baichwai and Sugdert (1986) "Vectors for gene transfer derived from animal DNA viruses: Transient and stable expression of transferred genes," hi: Kucherfapatt R, ed. Gene transfer. New York; Plenum Press; Coupar et al. (1 88) Gene, 68: 1 -10), and several RNA viruses. Preferred viruses include n alphavirus, a poxivirus, an arena vims, a vaccinia virus, a polio virus, and the like. They offer several attractive features for various mammalian cells (Friedmann. ( 1989) Science, 244:1275-1281 ; Ridgeway, 1988, supra; Baichwai and Sugden, 1986, supra ; Coupar et al , 1988; Honvich et a! .(1 90) J.Virol., 64:642-650). in other embodiments, target DNA in the genome can be manipulated using well- known methods ia the art. For example, the target DNA in the genome can be manipulated by deletion, insertion, and/or mutation are retroviral insertion, artificial chromosome techniques, gene insertion, random insertion with tissue specific promoters, gene targeting, tr ansposable elements and/or any other method for introducing foreign DNA or producing modified DNA/modified nuclear D A. Other modification techniques include deleting DMA sequences from a genome and/or altering nuclear DMA sequences. Nuclear DNA sequences, for example, may be altered by site-directed mutagenesis. in other embodim nts, recombinant biomarker polypeptides, and fragments thereof, can be administered to su jects, in some embodiments, fusion proteins can be consiatcted and administered which have enhanced biological properties. In addition, the biomarker polypeptides, and fragment thereof, can be modified according to well-known pharmacological methods in the art (e.g. , pegylation, glycosylation, oligomerization, etc.) in order to further enhance desirable biological activities, such as increased bioavailability and decreased proteolytic degradation. 4. Ciincai Efficacy Clinical efficacy can be measured b any method known in the art. For example, the response to a therapy, such as anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies, relates to any response of the cancer, e.g., a tumor, to the therapy, preferably to a change in tumor mass and/or volume after initiation of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Tumor response may be assessed in a neoadjuvant or adjuva t situation where the size of a tumor after systemic intervention can be compared to the initial size and dimensions as measured by CT, PET, mammogram, ultrasound or palpation and the eellukrity of a tumor can be estimated histologically and compared to the ceilularity of a tumor biopsy taken before initiation of treatment. Response may also be assessed b caliper measurement or pathological examination of the tumor after biopsy or surgical resection. Response may be recorded in a quantitative fashion like percentage change in tumor volume or ceilularity or using semi-quantitative scoring system such as residual cancer burden (Syramans el l, J. Clin. Oncol (2007) 25:4414-4422) or Miller-Payne score (Ogston el ol, (2003) Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland) 12:320-327) in a qualitative fashion like "pathological complete response" (pCR.), "clinical complete remission" (cCR), "clinical partial remission" (cPR), ""clinical stable disease" (cSD), "clinical progressive disease" (cPD) or other qualitative criteria. Assessment of tumor response may be performed early after the onset of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, e.g., after a few hours, days, weeks or preferably after a few months. A typical endpoint for response assessment is upon termination of neoadj uvan t chemotherapy or upon surgical removal of residual tumor cells and/or the tumor bed. iii some embodiments, clinical efficacy of the therapeutic treatments described herein may he determined by measuring the clinical benefit rate (CBR). The clinical benefit rate is measured by determining the sum of the percentage of 'patients who are in complete remission (C ), the number of patients who are in partial remission (PR) and the number of patients having stable disease (SD) at a time point at least 6 months out from the end of therapy. The shorthand for this formula is CBR:::€R- P.R SD over 6 months, in some embodiments, the CBR for a particular anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapeutic regimen is at least 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%. 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, or more. Additional criteria for evaluating the response to anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies are related to "survival " which includes ail of the following: survival until mortality, also known as overall survival (wherein said mortality may be either irrespective of cause or tumor related); "recurrence-free survival" (wherein the term recurrence shall include both localized and distant recurrence); metastasis free survival; disease free survival (wherein the term disease shall include cancer and diseases associated therewith). The length of said survival may be calculated by reference to a defined start point (e.g., time of diagnosis or start of treatment) and end point (e.g... death, -recurrence or metastasis), in addition, criteria for efficacy of treatment can be expanded to include response to chemotherapy, probability of survival, probability of metastasis within a given time period, and probability of tumor recurrence. For example, in order to determine appropriate threshold values, a particular anti- immune checkpoint inhibitor therapeutic regimen can be administered to a population of subjects and the outcome can be correlated to biomarker measurements that were determined prior to administration of any anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The outcome measurement may be pathologic response to therapy given in the neoadjuvant setting. Alternatively, outcome measures, such as overall survival and disease-free survival can be monitored over a period of time for subjects following anti-immune checkpoint- inhibitor therapy for whom biomarker measurement values are known. In certain embodiments, the same doses of anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor agents are administered to each subject, in related embodiments, the doses admiiiistered are standard doses .known in the art for anti-tniniune checkpoint inhibitor agents. The period of time for which subjects are monitored can vary. For example, subjects may be monitored for at least 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 1 8, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, or 60 months. Biomarker measurement threshold values that correlate to outcome of an anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy can be determined using methods such as those described in the Examples section, 5, Further Uses and Methods of the Present nvention The compositions described herein can be used in a variety of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic applications, a. Screening Methods One aspect: of the present invention relates to screeni ng assays, including non-cell based assays. In one embodiment, the assays provide a method for identifying whether a cancer is likely to respond to anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and/or whether an agent can inhibit the growth of or kill a cancer ceil thai is unlikely to respond to anti- immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In one embodiment, the invention relates to assays for screenin test agents which bind to, or modulate the biological activity of, at least one biomarker listed in Table 1. In one embodiment, a method for identifying such an agent entails determining the ability of the agent to modulate, e.g. inhibit, the at least one biomarker listed in Table I . In one embodiment, an assay is a cell-free or cell-based assay, comprising contacting at least one biomarker listed in Table 1 , with a test agent, and determining the ability of the test agent to modulate (e.g. inhibit) the enzymatic activity of the biomarker, such as by measuring direct binding of substrates or by measuring indirect parameters as described below. In another embodiment, an assay is a cell-free or cell-based assay, comprising contacting at least one metabolite biomarker listed in Table 1 , with a test agent, and determining the ability of the test agent to sequester the availability of the metabolite biomarker to signal or otherwise be sensed, such as by measuring direct binding of substrates or by measuring indirect parameters as described below. For example, in a direct binding assay, biomarker protein (or their respective target polypeptides or molecules) can be coupled with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that binding can be determined by detecting the labeled protein or molecule in complex. For example, the targets can be labeled with SI, j5S, l , or Ή, either directly or indirectly, and the radioisotope detected by direct counting of radioemmission or by scintillation counting. Alternatively, the targets can be enzymatically labeled with, for example. horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, or iuciferase and the enzymatic label defected by determination of conversion of an appropriate substrate to produc t. Determining the interaction between biomarker and substrate can also be accomplished using standard binding or enzymatic analysis assays. In one or more embodiments of the above described assa methods, it may be desirable to immobilize polypeptides or molecules to facilitate separation of complexed from uncomplexed forms of one or both of the proteins or molecules, as well as to accommodate automation of the assay. Binding of a test agent to a target can be accomplished in any vessel suitable for containing the reactants. Non-limiting examples of such vessels include microliter plates, test tubes, and micro-centrifuge tubes, immobilized forms of the antibodies of the present invention can also include antibodies bound to a solid phase like a porous, microporous (with an average pore diameter less than about one micron) or macroporous (with an average pore diameter of more than about 10 microns) material, such, as a membrane, cellulose, nitrocellulose, or glass fibers; a head, such as that made of agarose or polyaerylamide or latex; or a surface of a dish, plate, or well, such as one made of polystyrene. in an alternative embodiment determining the ability of the agent to modulate the interaction between the biomarker and a substrate or a biomarker metabolite and its natural binding partner can be accomplished by determining the ability of the test agent to modulate the activity of a polypeptide or other product that functions downstream or upstream of its position within the pathway {e.g.. feedback loops). The present invention further pertains to novel agents identified by the above- described screening assays. Accordingly, it is within the scope of this invention to further use an agent identified as described herein in an appropriate animal mode!. For example, an agent identified as described herein can be used in an animal model to determine the efficacy, toxicity, or side effects of treatment with such an agent Alternatively, an antibody identified as described herein can be used in an animal model to determine the mechanism of action of such an agent, b. Predictive Medicine The present invention also pertains to the field of predictive medicine in which diagnostic assays, prognostic assays, and monitoring clinical trials are used for prognostic (predictive) purposes to thereby treat an individual prophylactic-ally. Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention relates to diagnostic assays for determining the amount and/or activity level of a biomarker listed in Tabic 1 in the context of a biological sample (eg., blood, serum, ceils, or tissue) to thereby determine whether an individual afflicted with a cancer is likely to respond to arm-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, whether in an original or recurrent cancer. Such assays can be used for prognostic or predictive purpose to thereby prophylactic-ally treat an individual prior to the onset or after recurrence of a. disorder characterized by or associated with biomarker polypeptide, nucleic acid expression or activity. The skilled artisan will appreciate that any method can use one or more (e.g., combinations) of bioroarkers listed in Table ί . Another aspect of the present inve tion pertains to monitoring the influence of agents (e.g., drugs, compounds, and smali nucleic acid-based molecules) on the expression or activity of a biomarker listed in Table 1. These and other agents are described in further detail in the following sections. The skilled artisan will also appreciated that, in certain embodiments, the methods of the present invention implement a computer program and computer system. For example, a computer program can be used to perform the algorithms described herein. A computer system can also store and manipulate data generated by the methods of the present invention which comprises a plurality ofbiomarker signal changes/profiles which can be used by a computer system in implementing the methods of this inven tion. In certain embodiments, a computer system receives biomarker expression data; (it) stores the data; and (iii) compares the data in any number of way described herein (e.g., analysis relati ve to appropriate controls) to determine the state of informative bioraarkers from cancerous or pre-eaneero s tissue, in other embodiments, a computer system (i) compares the determined expression biomarker level to a threshold value; and (ii) outputs an indication of whether said biomarker level is significantly modulated (e.g., above or below) the threshold value, or a phenoiype based on said indication. In certain embodiments, such computer systems are also considered part of the present invention. Numerous types of computer systems can be used to implement the analytic methods of this invention according to knowledge possessed by a skilled artisan in the biomforniatics and/or computer ails. Several software components can be loaded into memory during operation of such a computer system. The software components can comprise both software components that are standard in the art and components that are special to the present invention (e.g., dCHiP software described in Lin et al. (2004) Bioinfbrmaiics 20, 1233- 1 240; radial basis machine learning algorithms (RBM) known in the art). The methods of the invention can also be programmed or modeled in mathematical software packages that allow symbolic entry of equations and high-level specification of processing, including specific algorithms to be used, thereby freeing a user of the need to procedurally program individual, equations and algorithms. Such packages include, e.g., Matlab from Mathworks (Natick, Mass.), Mathemattea from Wolfram Research (Champaign, HI.) or S-Phts from athSoft (Seattle, Wash.}. In certain embodiments, the computer comprises a database for storage of biomarker data. Such stored profiles can be accessed and itsed to perform comparisons of interest at a later point in time. For example, biomarker expression profiles of sample deri ved from the non -cancerous tissue of a subject and/or profiles generated from population-based distributions of informative loci of interest in relevant populations of the same species can be stored and later compared to that of a sample derived from the cancerous tissue of the subject or tissue suspected of being cancerous of the subject. la addition to the exemplary program structures and computer systems described herein, other, alternati ve program structures and computer systems will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan. Such alternative systems, which do not depart from the above described computer system and programs structures either in spirit or in scope, are therefore intended to be comprehended within the accompanying claims. c. Diagnostic Assays The present invention provides, in part, methods, systems, and code for accurately classifying whether a biological sample is associated with a cancer that is likel to respond to anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, hi some embodiments, the present invention is useful for classifying a sample (eg., from a subject} as associated with or at risk for responding to or not responding to anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy using a statistical algorithm and/or empirical data (e.g., the amount or activity of a biomarker listed in 'fable 1 ). An exemplary method for detecting the amount or activit of a biomarker listed in Table 1 , and thus useful for classifying whether a sample is likely or unlikely to respond to anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy involves obtaining a biological sample from a test subject and contacting the biological sample with an agent, such as a protein-binding agent like an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, or a nucleic acid-binding agent like an oligonucleotide, capable of detec ting the amount or activity of the biomarker in the biological sample. In some embodiments, at least one antibod or antigen-binding fragment thereof is used, wherein two, three, four, five, six, se ven, eight, nine, ten, or more such antibodies or antibody fragments can be used i combination (e.g., in sandwich ELISAs) or in serial. In certain instances, the statistical algorithm is a single learning statistical classifier system. For example, a single learning statistical classifier system can be used to classify a sample as a based upon a prediction or probability value and the presence or level of the biomarker. The use of a single learning statistical classifier system typically classifies the sample as, for example, likely anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy responder or progressor sample with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and/or overall accuracy of at least about 75%. 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81 %, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%. Other suitable statistical algorithms are well known to those of skill in the art. f r example, learning statistical classifier systems include a machine learning algorithmic technique capable of adapting to complex data sets (e.g., pane! of markers of interest) and making decisions based upon such data sets. Irt some embodiments, a single learning statistical classifier system such as a classification tree (e.g., random forest) is used, in other embodiments, a combination of 2, 3, 4, 5. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more learning statistical classifier systems are used, preferably in tandem. Examples of learning statistical classifier systems include, but are not limited to, those using inductive learning (e.g. , decision/classification trees such as random forests, classification and regression trees (C& T), boosted trees, etc.), Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, conneetioiHSt learning (e.g., neural networks (NN), artificial neural networks (ANN), rieuro fuzzy networks (NFN), network structures, perceptions such as multi-layer perceptions, multi-layer feed-forward networks, applications of neural networks, Bayesian learning in belief networks, etc,), reinforcement learning (e.g., passive learning in a known environment such, as naive learning, adaptive dynamic learning, and temporal difference learning, passive learning in an unknown environment, active learning in an unknown environment, learning action-value functions, applications of reinforcement learning, etc.), and genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming. Other learning statistical classifier systems include support vector machines (e.g. , Kernel methods), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms, Gauss-Newton algorithms, mixtures of Gaussians, gradient- descent algorithms, and learning vector quantization (LVQ). In certain embodiments, the method of the present invention further comprises sending the sample classification results to a clinician, e.g., an oncologist In another embodiment, the diagnosis of a subject is followed by administering to die individual a therapeutically effective amount of a defined treatment based upon the diagnosis, in one embodiment the methods further involve obtaining a control bioiogicai sample (e.g. , biological sample from a subject who does not have a cancer or whose cancer is susceptible to anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy), a bioiogicai sample from the subject during remission, or a bioiogicai sample from the subject during treatment for developing a cancer progressing despite anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. d. Prognostic Assays The diagnostic methods described herein can furthermore be utilized to identi fy subjects having or at risk of developing a cancer that is likely or unlikely to be responsive to anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The assays described herein, such as the preceding diagnostic assays or the following assays, can be utilized to identify a subject having or at risk of developing a disorder associated with a mi singulation of the amount or activity of at least one biomarker described in Table Ϊ , such as in cancer. Alternatively, the prognostic assays can be utilized to identify a subject having or at risk for developing a disorder associated wi th a misregulation of the at least one biomarker described in Table 1 , such as in cancer. Furthermore, the prognostic assays described herein can be used to determine whether a subject can be administered an agent (e.g., an agonist, antagonist, peptidomimetie, polypeptide, peptide, nucleic acid, small molecule, or other drug candidate) to treat a disease or disorder associated with the aberrant biomarker expression or activity. e. Treatment Methods The compositions described herein (including dual binding antibodies and deri vatives and conjugates thereof) can be used in a variety of m vitro and in vivo therapeutic applications using the formulations and/or combinations described herein, in one embodiment, anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor agents can be used to treat cancers determined to be responsive thereto. For example, antibodies that block the interactio between PD-L l, PD-L2, and/or CTLA-4 and their receptors (e.g. , PD-L I binding to P -i, PD-L2 binding to PD-i , and the like) can be used to treat cancer in subjects identified as likely responding thereto.

The term "pharmaceuticaUy-acccptablc salts" refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of the agents that modulates (e.g., inhibits) biomarker expression and/or activity, or expression and/or acti vity of the complex encompassed by the invention. These salts can be prepared in sim during the final isolation and purification of the agents, or by separately reacting a purified agent in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed. Representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate, acetate, valerate, oleate, pafcmtate, stearate, laorate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fnmarate, succinate, tartrate, napfhylate, mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactohionate, and laurylsitlphonate salts and the like (See, for example, Berge et l.

Pharm, Set 66: 1-19). in other eases, the agents useful in the methods of the present invention may contain one or more acidic functional groups and, thus, are capable of forming pharmaceutically- acceptable salts with pharmaeeutically-acceptable bases. The term '^pharmaceutically- acceptable salts" in these instances refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic base addition salts of agents that modulates (e.g. , inhibits) biomarker expression and/or activity, or expression and/or activity of the complex. These salts can likewise he prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the agents, or by separately reacting the purified agent in its free acid form with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharraaceutically-acceptable metal cation, with ammonia, or with a pl rnaceutically-acceptabie organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine.

Examples of pharmaceutically -acceptable antioxidants include: (1 ) water soluble antioxidants, suc as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium nietabisidfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl paimifatc, butylated hydroxyaniso!e (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluenc (BHT), lecithin, propyl gaJiate, alpha-tocopheroi, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetfaaeetie acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Formulations useful in the methods of the present invention include those suitable for oral nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal aerosol and or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently he presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a. carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated, the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient, which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally he that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred per cent, this amount will range from about 1 per cent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 per cent to about 70 per cent, most preferably from about 1.0 per cent to about 30 per cent. Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association an agent that modulates (e.g., inhibits) biomarker expression and/or activity, with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a agent- with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then,, if necessary, shaping the produc t. Formulations suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or iragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueou or nonaqueous liquid, or as an oi!-ia-water or water-m-oii liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, SUCK as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of a agent as an active ingredient.

Molded tablets ma be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered peptide or pepiidomimefic moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Tablets, and other solid dosage Forms, such as dragees, capsules, piils and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and oilier coatings well known in the phannaceutical-tbrmulatrag art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for exam le, hydroxypropylraethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized fay, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions, which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredients) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions, which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, rokroeraulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain, inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, soiubilizing agents and emulsifkrs, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyi alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butytene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, com, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofnryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents. Suspensions, in addition to the active agent may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxyiafed isostearyi alcohols, polyoxyefhylcne sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrysta!line cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, benkmite, agar-agar and tragacanfh, and mixtures thereof. Formulations for rectal or vaginal adn nistration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared fay mixing one or more agents with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a supposiitorv wax or a salicylate,, and which is soiid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release tie active agent. Formulations which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampans, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such earners as are known in the art to be appropriate. Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of an agent that modulates ( .g., inhibits) biomarker expression and/or activity include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active component may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutieally-aceeptabie carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propeilants which may be required. The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to a agent, exeipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentortites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof. Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to an agent that modulates (e,g\, inhibits) biomarker expression and/or activity, exeipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates an.d olyanii.de powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propeilants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane. The agent that modulates (e.g., inhibits) biomarker expression and/or activity, can be alternatively administered by aerosol. Thi is accomplished by preparing an aqueous aerosol, liposomal preparation or solid particles containing the compound. A nonaqueous (<?.g., fiuorocarbon propeilant) suspension could be used. Sonic nebulizers are preferred because they minimize exposing the agent to shear, which can result in degradation of the compound. Ordinarily, an aqueous aerosol is made by formulating an aqueous solution or suspension of the agent together with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and stabilizers. The carriers and stabilizers vary with the requirements of the particular compound, but typically include nortiontc surfactants (T weens, Plurouics, or polyethylene glycol), innocuous proteins like serum albumin, sorbitan esters, oleic acid, lecithin, amino acids such as glycine, buffers, sails, sugars or sugar alcohols. Aerosols generally are prepared from: isotonic solutions. Transdermal -patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a agent to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the agent in die proper medium. Absorption enhancer can also be used to increase the flux of the pephdomimetk across the skin. The rate of such, flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the peptidomimetic in a polymer matrix or gel. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within die scope of this invention. Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more agents in combination with one or more pharmaceuticaHy-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include wa te r, ethanol, po!yols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the ease of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. These compositions may a! so contain adjuva ts such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorhic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions, in addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. in some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parentera.liy-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microeneapsuJe matrices of an agent that modulates (e.g. , inhibits) biomarker expression and/or activity, in biodegradable polymers such as polylaetide-poSyglyeolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orihoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions, which are compatible with bod tissue. When the agents of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1 to 99.5% (more preferably, 0.5 to 90%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invenlion may be determined by the methods of the present invention so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient, which i effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular subject, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to die subject. The nucleic acid molecules of the invention can be inserted into vectors and used as gene therapy vectors. Gene therapy vectors can be delivered to a subject by. for example, intravenous injection, local administration (see U.S, Pat, No, 5,328,470) or by stereotactic injection (see e.g. , Chen et a!. (1994) Proc. Nail. Acad. Set USA 9] :3054 3057). The pharmaceutical preparation of the gene therap vector can include the gene therapy vector in an acceptable diluent, or can comprise a slow release matrix in which the gene delivery vehicle is imbedded. Alternatively, where the complete gene delivery vector can be produced intact from recombinant ceils, e.g. , retroviral vectors, the pharmaceutical preparation can include one or more ceils which produce the gene delivery system. The present invention also encompasses kits for detecting and/or modulating oncogene biomarkers (eg. , activating mutations in oncogene biomarkers) and tumor suppressor biomarkers (e.g., inhibiting mutations in tumor suppressors) described herein. A kit of the present invention may also inciude instructional materials disclosing or describing the use of the kit or an antibody of the disclosed invention in a method of the disclosed invention as provided herein. A kit may also include additional components to facilitate the particular application for which the kit is designed. For example, a kit may additionally contain means of detecting the label (e.g., enzyme substrates for enzymatic labels, filter set to detect fluorescent labels, appropriate secondary labels such as a sheep aeti -mouse-MRP, etc.) and reagents necessary for controls (e.g., control biological samples or metabolite standards). A kit may additionally include buffers and other reagents recognized for use in a method of the disclosed invention- Non-limiting examples include agents to reduce non- specific binding, such as a carrier protein or a detergent. Other embodiments of the present invention are described in the following Examples.

Mouse coho ts and huma samples Mouse cohorts L$L:Kms0!m, and l.SL:Kr s !'' '>;LK }!'i'";p53,'':'!' were all maintained in virus-free conditions on a mixed 129/FVB background, Nu/Nit mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories International Inc. All the mice were housed in a Bl.,2 lab at Dana Father Cancer institute. All care and treatment of experi.nie.ntai animals were in accordance with Harvard Medical School Dana-Farber Cancer instititte institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) guidelines. Mice were given Ad-Cre via intranasal infections at 6-8 weeks old. Mice were monitored for signs of lung tumor onset and euthanized for gross and histological analysis and. tumor isolation upon signs of distress. Patient slides were provided by the pathology department of Brigham and Women's Hospital, All human samples and clinical information were obtained under Institutional Review Board approved protocols (02- 180 and 07-0.120). Frozen PD tissues were purchased from die Van Andel Institute (Grand Rapids, Ml). b. Flow cytometry analysis and sorting Tumor were dissected from: the lungs of pnmaty rnice an tumor tissue was prepared as described in Curtis et al. (2 10) Cell Stem. Cell 7: 127-133 and Akbay el al. (20.13) Cancer Discov. 3: 1355-1363. Single cell suspensions were stained using rat-anti- mouse antibodies. Detailed antibody information and gating strategy can be found in Akbay er al. (2013) Cancer Discov. 3: 1355-1363 and as follows: Atuirni ring. antibgdicg Anti-human antibodies Ail antibodies were incubated for 15-20 minutes at 1 ; 100 dilutions for primary antibodies and 1:200 for secondary antibodies. Cell sorting was performed with a B.D FACS Aria 11, and data were analyzed with FloJo software (Tree Star). For sorting NGFR. and SCA i■fractions, cells were first gated on FSC/SCC and DAPF ceils, then on EpCAM- PECy7 CD45-APC'CD33 -APC\ and finally on SCAI-FITC and NGFR-PE fractions. FACS-sorted mouse cells were resuspended in MTBC/Plus containing 20 ng/rai EOF and FGF2, mixed 1 : 1 with growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and pipetted into a 12-well 0.4 μηι Transwell insert (Falcon). TEC/Plns medium (700 μΐ) was added to the lower chamber and refreshed every other day . Intratracheal transplants were performed as described (Curtis el al. (2010) Cell Stem Cell 7; 127-133). Intrathoracic injections were performed as described (Jongsma et. al. (2008) Cancer Cell 13:261 -271 ). d. Gene expression profile analysis Arrays were performed in Dana-Farber Cancer institute facility on Affymetrix mouse Genel .OST slides. Array quality was assessed using die R/Biocouductor package (available on the World Wide Web at bioconductor.org). Raw CEL files from U 1.33 A Affymetrix arrays were processed using the robust muMarray average (RMA) algorithm (irizarry et l. (2003) Nucleic Acids .He$. 31 :el5). To identify genes correlating with the phenotypie groups, the Kmma and SAM algorithms (Smyth (2004) Sun. Appl. Genet. Mol, Biol. 3;Arttele3 (e-pub)) were used to fit a statistical linear model to the data. The data were then tested for differential gene expression in the three groups: Normal EpCAM', ras tumor EpCAM" and LP tumor EpCAM* . For the analysis of the EpCAM*CD45 s immune ceil fractions, LP tumor EpCAM. \ Kras tumor CD45" and LP tumor CD4. were contrasted. The vermSeSeet function in R was used to contrast the differentially expressed genes for each cell type. Multiple hypothesis testing was corrected for using the Benjamini and Hoehberg method (BH) (Benjamini and Hochberg (.1 95) J. R. Statist Soc. B 57:289- 3(H)), and significantly differentially expressed genes arc reported (Table 2). The array raw data and log2 RMA signal were uploaded to GEO under GEO accession number: GSE54353. For the mouse and hum n comparative analysis fold changes of gene expression in the LP mice as compared to normal lung and hitman squamous cell cancers with PTEN or LKBI abnormalities compared to normal lung (available on the World Wide Web at tcga-datajici.nih.gov/tcga/) were analyzed using SAMR using the two class comparison function (available on the World Wide Web at stat.starrford.edu/~4ibs/SAy/}. For GSEA analysis (Subiamanian et al (2005) Pmc, Nail. Acad Sci. U.S.A. 102:15545- 15550) either the LP tumor EpCAM" vs Kras tumor EpCAM! rank ordered gene list, or the LP tumor CD45" vs Kras tumor CD45" rank ordered gene list was used. R A-sorted tumor populations was isolated on Qiagen Neasy kit. cDNA was made using the Superscript ill kit (invitrogen). Relative gene expression was assayed with Taqmari assays performed on the StepOnePhts™ Real-Time PGR. System (Applied Biosystems). £ H istolo g and immunonls tocherr s ry Mice were sacrificed with CC¾ and the right lobe was dissected and snap-frozen, for biochemical analysis. The remainder of the lungs was inflated with neutral buffered 1 % formalin overnight at room tempera ture and then transferred to 70% ethanoi, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 pm. Hematoxylin and eosin (B&E) stains were performed in the Department of Pathology in Brigham and Women's Hospital. PD-L l. immunoiiistocheinistry was performed using an automated iinmunostainer (Ventana, Tucson, AZ) on patient slides and manually on the mouse slides at 10 r g/ral concentration using ant!-PD-Ll antibody as described in Chen et al.

Mctaboiomics profiles analysis Metabolite extraction and targeted mass spectrometry analysts for mctaboiomics profiles were conducted as described in Yuan et al. (2012) Nat. Pratoc 7:872-881. Briefly, the frozen tumors were smashed in cold 80% HPLC-grade methanol on dry ice twice, and then the extractions were Speed Vac/lyophilized to a pellet using no heat. The data were normalized and analyzed with Metaho Analyst 2.0 (Xia et a I. (2012) Nucleic Acids Rex. 40: W 127-W.l 3), In hierarchical cluster analysis, each sample begins as a separate cluster and the algorithm proceeds to combine them until all samples belong to one cluster. Clustering result shown as a heat map (distance measure using Pearson and clustering algorithm using ward), i. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism. All numerical data are presen ted as rneanistandard error of the mean (SEM). Grouped analysis was performed using two-wa ANOVA, Column analysis was using one-way ANOVA or West. A p- value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. jj-- * E Exxpprreessssiioonn ddaattaa f frroomm: wwiilldd ttyyppee aanndd EEGGFF ttrraannssggeenniicc mmiiccee wweerree o obbttaaiinneedd ffrroomm WWeeaavveerr eett a ail.

Example 2: £ / mice develop lang squamous cell carcinomas that recapitulate the human disease in order to examine the possibility that IJbi and Pten loss would lead to lung SCC formation, 6-8 week-old Lkb /ft'as Pt<mA'a (Lkbi.Pi n or LP) mice were administered Adenovirus-Cre (Acl-Cre) via intranasal instillation (Figure I A), in contrast to other hmg- specific genetic mouse models described to date, including Kra$<,ul> (Kras), Kras0}m;pS^(Kras;pS$ Krmai ;LkblM?(Kras;lM!) and Kras°1 D;p5 *;LkbP* (Kras;p53;Lkhi), in which the predominant phenofypes are adenocarcinoma or mixed adenosquamous ceil carcinoma, 100% of the LP mice developed typical lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) with a 40-50 week latency (Figures 1 B and 2A-2B). Small malignant nodules with squamous characteristics were evident at different time-points after Ad-Cre infection ranging from 30 to 40 weeks. Both Lkbl and Pten were confirmed to be homozygous!}-* deleted by PGR on genomic DNA from sorted tumor cells (Figure 2C). The LP tumors were verified as recapitulating human SCC pathology ; within the tumor nodules, mature squamous cells growing in a solid configuration with aberran t nuclear morphology (Figure ICa), large infiltrates of neutrophils (Figure I Cb), and keratinized ceils or individual cells with markedly dense eosinophilic cytoplasm were all observed (Figure I Cc). Tumors showed hallmarks of well-differentiated SCC, Including invading fibrous stroma with prominent keratmization (keratin pearls) (Figure ICd). in some cases, SCC nodules were visible in airways (Figure ICe), and at later time points showed lymphovascular invasion (Figure !Cf). Tumors arose in both the proximal (Figure 2D, top arrow) and distal lung (Figure 2D-2E, bottom arrows), though many nodules appeared to be surrounded completely by alveolar epithelium. Low frequency metastatic lesions were visible in the chest wall of these mice (3/78) (Figure 2F). To confirm the phenotype of the LP tumors, immurtobistochemistry was performed for markers used clinically to distinguish human lung ADC from lung SCC. TTFJ. (also known as NKX2-I) and $0X2 are genomicaily amplified in lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, respectively, and routinely used as histologic markers (Bass et al (2009) Nat Genet. 41 ; 123 - 1242; Weir el al (200?) Nature 450:893-898). In addition, positive staining for the markers p63 and keratm-5/6 (KRT5/6) appear to robustly classify SCCs from ADC's (Fatima et al. (2012) Diagn. Cytopatbol. 40:943-948). Similar to the human SCC samples, the LP tumor nodules displayed high expression ofp63, KRT5 and SOX2, while TTF1 staining was negative (Figure 3 A). The expression patterns of 63, RT5 and SOX2 in SCC co-localized with the expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) (Figure 3 A). In contrast, Kraslr ~dnv murine ADC and human ADC tissues were p63-, K.RT5- and SOX2-negative, while TTFl staining was strongly positive, confirming their ADC pheno ype (Figure 3A). Together these data indicate that LP tumors strongly resemble hitman SCC by their expression of the classic squamous markers p63, KRT5/6 and SOX2, and hallmarks of squamous differentiation such as keratin deposition. Next, the transcriptional landscapes of the LP tumors to those {bund in primary human tumors were compared. To do this, the gene expression profile of 34 human SCC tumors with either LKBl or PTEN lterations from the Cancer Genome Atlas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research (2012.) Nature 489:539-52.5) was compared to 35 normal human lung tissues samples to generate a list of genotype-specific SCC genes. In parallel, the gene expression profiles of LP tumors from three independent mice were compared to profiles of normal lung from three age-matched LP mice that ne ver received Ad-Cre. In the human comparison, 8237 genes were significantly differentially expressed in the SCCs versus normal human lung with a. corrected p value (90* percentile FDR) of zero. Compared to normal, 3658 genes were up-regulated in tumors and 4579 down-regulated, in the smaller mouse dataset, 2236 genes were differentially expressed with 9.16 up-regulated and 1320 down-regulated (Figure 4A). Comparison of the mouse and human gene sets yielded 893 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in both human tumors with LKBl and/or PTEN alterations and LP mouse SCCs (Figure 4B). Among the shared up-regulated genes were several known scjuamous-associated genes, including SOX2, P63, NOTCH3, HRAS and several keratins (KRT5/KKT6). Gene ontogeny analysis demonstrated enrichment for genes implicated in squamous differentiation (p-3.62 x 10" Η); Figure 3B). In contrast, the shared down-regulated genes were enriched for terminal respiratory unit differentiation, consistent with the idea that SCC more closely resembles proximal lung cells than distal epithelia (p=::4.07 x 10""; Figure 3C), Example J: LkbJ^iPt n^ lung SCCs display unique gene expression, metabolism and downstream signaling pathways in order to characterize the gene expression profiles specific to the tumor cells within die mouse LkbJ;Ptett SCCs, fluorescence activated celi sorting (FACS) was used to enrich for the epithelial cell (CD45"CD3 Γ EpCAM ÷) from LP SCC tumor nodules, Kras driven tumor nodules and normal lung (Figure SA). The gene expression profiles of these three epithelial cell fractions were then contrasted (Figure 6A; p<0.00 i). Remarkably, all of the genes differentially expressed between normal epithelial and LP tumor cells are likewise differentially expressed when comparing Kras tumor to LP tumor cells. This result indicates that Kras tuniors retain some gene expression reminiscent of the normal distal lung epithelial cell, from which they likely arise. In contrast, LP tumor ceils do not resemble ADC or normal distal lung ceils, and instead have markers expressed by tracheal basal cells as discussed below. The genes that were differentially expressed in the LP tumor cells when compared to both Kras tumor cells and normal lung were then focused on. In this comparison, 408 genes were up-regulated and 297 genes were down-regulated with a log fold change >1.8 and an adjusted p value <0, 01 (Table 2). Selected genes that can be organized by ftmction/family are illustrated by a heat map (Figure 6B). Gene sets that were up-regulated in LP tumors include the keratin family members, including Krt5} which were observed by IHC, and other squamous keratins, such as Krt6a, Krt6b and KrlM. Also highly up- regulated in LP tumors were the transcription- factors Sox 2 imdp . consistent with the IHC results, and Slug and Paxil Among the secreted proteins and cytokines produced by these tumor were several Cxcl famil members, including Cxcl3, Cxcl? and CxcIS, and members of the Wrtl, Bmp and interleukin super-families. Several enzymes that were highly expressed in LP cells included Serpin family members and argtms l. Lastly, genes for proteins and receptors known to be localized to the cell membrane that were highly expressed in LP cell included Seal, Ngfr, Egfr' and Pdll. Ngfr in particular was of interest because it is known to be a stem, cell marker in the tracheal epithelium, and Pdll expression suggested a mechanism of immune evasion for LP tumor cells. Genes down-regulated in LP tumors included TgfrbS and surfactants. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was then used to query the pathways and molecular phenotypes specific to the LP tumors (Subramanian et al. (2007) Bioinform tics 23:3251-3253). To do this, a rank-ordered gene list derived from the contrast of LP EpCAM" cells to Kras EpCA .'! ceils was used. The gene list was first queried for enrichment of the four known transcriptionally defined sub-classes of human lung SCC (Wilkerson t ai. (20 iO) Clot. Cancer Rex. 16:4864-4875). It was found thai the LP model very closely recapitulates the expression pattern found in the basal subtype of human SCC (Figure 5B; p<0,0001 ; NES~ I .9), Gene sets enriched in the LP tumor ceils compared to Kras tumor cells included those positively regulated by AKTl and mTOR., while a iuag specific KRAS-associated gene set was enriched in the Kras ceils (Figure 5C; pO.OOOJ for AKTl and mTOR; p=0. i for KRAS). In addition, compared to tumors driven by Kras, KmsjAbl. Kras;Pten and Kra$;p53;LkhL the LP tumors have much stronger p-A T but weaker p-ERK staining (Figures 6C-6D). Together these data indicate that the oncogenic signaling pathways activated in the f. h1;Pten tumors predominantly involve A T and. mTOR, while those in Kras tumors involve downstream mediators of RAS signaling such as MEK and ERK. To address potential metabolic differences between SCC, ADC and normal lung, the metabolites in each tissue were profiled. In addition, to the transcriptional differences observed among the samples, metabolic profiles of LP tumors, Kras tumors and normal murine lungs were unique. The metabolic profiles of both Kras and LP tumors clustered completely separately from normal lung. Furthermore, metabolites in Kras tumors and LP tumors segregated the tumor types into two distinct clusters (Figure 6D and Table 3). Among the metabolites most significantly changed in LP ceils relative to normal lung were L-arginine (reduced) and creatine (increased) (Figure 5E)„ which were expected due to the increased expression of arginasel in these cells, which was confirmed by real-time RT- PCBL (Figure 5F; p<0.001). Example 4: f.kbl Pfenm lung SCCs are enriched for tumor-associated neutrophils (TA s) As noted histologically, the LP SCC lesions contained iarge neutrophilic infiltrates, suggesting that the immune microenvironment was distinct from, the typical tumor associated macrophage (TAM)-rieh microe virotiments observed in most mouse Kras and Kras;pS3 driven ADC models. To better understand the role of the inflammatory rokroenvironraent in lung SCC versus Kras ADC, immune ceils (CD45') from LP SCCs and Krm or Kras;p53 ADCs were compared by flo cytometry, in Kms and Krm;p53 tumors TAMs (alveolar macrophages, C.D45+CDi 1 c 'Di lb"CD103") redominated; however, within the LP tumors, the CD45 : population contained significantly fewer macrophages and more TANs (CD45 CD 1 1 b' Ly6G +) (Figurs 7A-7B; p<0.OO0I ). TANs may promote tumorigenesis by stimulating angiogenesis and immunosuppression in the tumor micrc^mdronment (Dumitru i at. (20! 3) S min. Cancer Biol. 23: 141 - 148). Interestingly, the prevalence of TANs increased with tumor burden, as lung lobes with higher weight (indicative of higher tumor burden) showed substantially more TANs (Figure 7C; p<0,0001). In contrast, the absolute counts of T cells, B cells, NK cells and TAMs decreased with increasing iobe weight (Figure 8A), suggesting a selective recruitment and/or proliferation of TANs during SCC tumor progression. To further confirm the presence of TANs in LP tumor nodules in situ, staining for myeloperoxidase (Mpo\ a. marker that is highly expressed by TANs in tumor bearing mice (Youn ei at (2012) J, Leukoc. Biol. 91 : 1.67-181), was performed. Within the LP SCCs, MPO: TANs appeared to be specifically localized to squamous lesions surrounded by p63"r epithelial cells (Figures 7.D and 88), Conversely, macrophages, identified by F4/80 ! staining in mouse tissue were distributed widely within or around SCC and ADC lesions (Figures 7D and 8B). Similar patterns were observed in human samples. MPO staining was strongly positive in 13/15 human primary SCC samples examined, while onl 4/12 human primary ADC showed staining (Table 4; p ~ 0.007). Macrophages (CD .163* in human tissue) were scattered in both human ADCs and SCCs (Figures 7E and 8C). These differences in ceil infiltrates between adenocarcinoma and squaraous cell carcinoma lesions were clearly evident in tumors obtained from the mixed histology p5$"-";Pie "";1Μί'"·'χ (p53;Lkbl;Plen or PLP) mouse model in this model, distinct areas of ADC and SCC were sometimes observed in close proximity to each other in the lung. Confirming their histologic identity, the squamous areas in PLP mice expressed high levels of 63, while the acinar areas were negative. Importantly, staining for MPO was specific to the SCC area of the tumor, suggesting that TANs are specifically recruited to SCC lesions ( Figure 7F). Similarly, the enrichment for TANs specifically in the areas of SCC tumors, but not in the adjacent ADC tumors, was also observed in the Kras;LM ί mouse model, which also has the mixed ADC and SCC histology (Figure 8D). To further explore the differences between CD45 ' fractions within SCC and ADC lung tumors, CD45 "EpCAM" ceils were isolated from LP and Krus tumors, and ni.icroarray analysis was performed. By contrasting the gene expression profiles of LP CD45' cells against LP EpCAM* ceils and Kras (2045* cells, a list of 156 genes significantly enriched in LP CD45 : ceils (Table 5; adjusted p<0.025) was constructed. Among the genes highly expressed by these ceil was Ly6G, further confirming the TAN phenotype (Youn ei al. (2012) J. Leukoc. Biol. 91 : 167-1 1 ), By qPCR, it was also confirmed that Μρ , argrnasel and Cxcr2 are enriched in SCC lesions from LP mice, while their expression was negligible in Kras- and Kr s;p53-inmor derived CD 5* cells (p~0.005, pO.OOl and p^O.OOl I respectively; Figure 8E). Immunologic signatures that were enriched in the ranked ordered list of LP vs Kras CD45 " genes were also queried. By using two sets of independently derived signatures comparing monocyte/macrophages to neutrophils (Abbas el al. (2005) Genes Immun. 6:319-331 ; onuraa et al. (201 1 ) Exp. ematol. 39:697-709), a clear enrichment for neutrophil signatures in the LP CD45 cells was found, while macrophage signatures were significantly enriched in the . Kras CD45" cells (Figure 7G) (p<0.00l ). From expression profiling of sorted mouse lung cancer cells, it has been demonstrated that lung cancers drive a fay Kras have higher level of argtnase, therbeby also providing an means to stratify-* king cancer patient for arginasc inhibitors. Similarly, it is believed based on both experimental evidence and theory that arginase expression is upregulated in cancers having an activating N AS mutation and/or an activating HRAS mutation. Elevated expression of the ehemokine receptor Cxcr2 suggests one mechanism through which the LP EpCAM' cells are able to specifically recruit TANs. Many of the CXC-Ligand family members have neutrophil ehemoattractant activity (De Filippo et al. (2013) Blwxi 121 :4930-4937), and appeared to be up-regulated at the transcriptional level in the EpCAM inicroarray. Therefore, the protein concentrations of these cytokines, including CXCL1 , CXCL2, CXCL5 and CXCL7, were assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from Lkhl;Plen tumor-bearing mice. Compared with levels observed BAL fluid isolated from norma! mice, all these ehemokines were significantly elevated in BAL fluid from LP tumor-bearing mice (Figure 8F; p<0.002), suggesting a mechanism through which TANs are recruited and stimulated by these tumors, in addition, GCSP, another essential regulator of neutrophil trafficking (Semerad et al (2002) immunity 17:413-423), was also elevated in LP BAL fluid (Figure 8F; p == 0,0002). Together, these data confirm that in contrast to murine Kras and Kr s:p53 ADC models that contain predominantly macrophages, lung SCCs show accumulation of TANs, indicating that di stinct oncogenic drivers in NSCLC sculpt the immune rmcroeavironment in different ways. - 14! - Example Si LkbJ^iPt n^ lung SCCs display hallmarks of immune suppression The types of X cells present in LP SCC tumors were evaluated by flow cytometry. Compared to T cell populations isolated from normal lung and peri -tumoral areas, the T ceils within LP tumors were significantly enriched for Tregs as determined by FO.XP3 5 staining (Figure 9A). The ratio of CDS : T ceils to FOXP3* Tregs within die tumor and surrounding tissues decreased with increasing tumor burden, indicating that the levels of immunosuppression rose with disease progression (figure 9B; p<0.000i). The accumulation of Tregs in LP tumors was further confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for FOXP3 in LP nodules (Figure C). In addition, T cells in LP tumors highly it) expressed the negative T cell co-stimulatory molecule programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-i) and increased percentages of PD-1 positive T ceils (both CD4 ' and CD f ) correlated with increased tumor burden (Figures 9D-9E; p<0.0001). In contrast to the increased PD- 1 expression on T ceils, lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG 3) and T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM3), two other known i mune- 15 modulating proteins, showed modestly increased expression (Figure i A). Cytokines in SAL fluids, including TGFp and IL6, were further evaluated. Compared to levels in normal lung, these cytokines were significantly increased in BAL fluids from LP tumor- bearing mice (Figure l B; p<0.0009). Previous reports have shown that TGFp and 3L6 promote tumor growth, regulate Treg cell development and cause immunosuppression 20 (Flavell ei at. (201 ) Nat. Rev. Imm noL 10:554-567). Since high levels οΐ ΜΪ were observed in the LP EpCAM" cells by microarray, and published work suggests that PD-L l can induce Tregs (Francisco et al. (2009) J. Exp. Med. 206:3015-3029), the expression of this inimunomodulating protein was further explored. PD-Ll expression was first observed on LP tumor cells by 25 immunohistoehemistry (Figure 9.F). High cell surface expression of PD-Ll on EpCAM !CD45" cells from LP tumors was confirmed by flow cytometry (Figure 9G 1 ; p<0.OO01 ). Pdll expression was further confirmed with real-time PCR on EpCAM'CD45* cells from normal lung and LP tumors, and 6-fold more Pdll mRN A was observed tn the LP tumor cells when compared to levels in normal distal lung epithelium (Figure 9G2, 0 p=0.0O.13). The increased numbers of Tregs, together with the high levels of PD-1 and PD- Ll on immune and tumor cells, respectively, indicated that immune suppression plays an important role during lung SCC tumorigenesis. Example 6: A SCA1* GFR* phenot pe is enriched in Lkbl^Pten lung SCC Tumor Propagating Cells (TPCs) it was determined if LP SCCs contained distinct tumor propagating cell (TPC) populations. The analysis was begun with two known stem cell makers, SCA 1 and NGFR, which mark BASCs and tracheal basal cells, respectively. NGF expression was examined on BASCs and SCA1 expression on basal cells. It was found that while nearly 100% of NGFR" basal cells expressed SCA ! , only -25% of SCA 1* BASCs express NGFR. (Figure 1 1 A). Within the BpCAM"CD45" cell populations, LP tumor cells showed high expression of SCA I and NGFR, and LP tumors harbored a unique population of SCA 1 "NGFR" cells that comprised an average of 17.5% of the LP EpCANf cells. Interestingly, t is population was nearly absent in both Kras and Kras;p53 ADC models (Figures 1 2A-12B (p<0.00 i) and 1 1 B-l I C). Ngfr transcript was 30-fold more abundant in LP tumor cells than in normal lung or Kras epithelial fractious (Figure 11 D; p Q.00GS ). NGFR also specifically stained the LP SCC tumor lesions but was not detectable in Kras tumor lesions by IHC (Figure 12C1 ). Likewise, in human primary lung SCCs, NGF staining was observed in 1 1/13 samples examined, while only 2/ 12 human primar ADC sections had detectable NGFR staining (Figure 12C2 and Table 4; ::: 0.001). lap53;Pten;LkbI (PLP) tumors where the A DC and SCC lesions were juxtaposed, NGFR staining was specific to the SCC side of the tissue section (Figure I2C3). FACS was used to fractionate LP EpCAM:'CD3 CCD45' tumor cells according to SCA1 and NGFR expression for functional comparison of TPC capacity. First, a surrogate in vitro assay for tumor propagation was used. Four distinct populations, SCAF GFR", SCA!NGFR ', SCA f NGFR" and SCAFNGFR" cells, were collected and co-cultured in Matrigel with CD45XD31 'support' cells isolated from the primary tumors. The tumor colony forming ability of Kras and Kras;p53 sorted tumor fractions was also evaluated in the 3D Matrigel system (Figure 1 IE). In agreement with previous in vivo results described in Curtis ei at (2010) Cell Stem Cell 7: 127-133 and validating this assay for TPC capacity, SCAi ' cells from Kras:p53 tumors were enriched for tumor colony formation ability (p:=::0.0026), but the same was not true for Kras tumors. SCAi 'NGFR" cells from LP tumors formed the most tumor colonies in 3D cultures, suggesting that they are the fraction enriched for tumor propagation (Figure 12D; p ::: 0.001 1 ). The morphology and histology of the LP tumor colonies were distinct from those found in Kras or Kras:p53 tumor cultures (Figure 1 IF). By immunofluorescence, the Lkbl;Pien tumor colonies expressed the squamous marker p63, but not the adenocarcinoma associated Surfactant protein C (SPC), while both the Kras and Kra ;p53 derived colonies expressed SPC (Figure 1 .1 F). To determine if SCA L GF cells from LP tumors were enriched for tumor propagating ceil characteristics in vivo, three major fractions of the EpCAM" cells from primary LP tumors, SCALNGFRL, SCA 1 *NGFR" and SCA.1 "NGFR" were transplanted ort'hotopicaliy into inununo-compromised mouse recipients immediately following FACS purification (figure 1 IG). The fraction of SCA I "NGFR* was not tested doe to its reproducibly small abundance. Of the four mice that received SCAI ' NGFR : cells, all developed typical SCC with p6T, SOX2; and KRT5" staining within 30-40 weeks (Figures 12E- 12F). To assess the presence of self-renewing IPCs within these tumors, the secondary tumors were dissected, dissociated, sorted for NGF and SCAI and the three major fractions were transplanted for tertian1 tumor .formation. All mice transplanted with SCAi *NGFR';' developed tertiary SCC within 11-27 weeks (Figure 12E; p =-=-=- 0.001 for secondary; p - 0.002 for tertians fisher's Exact Test). Al! primary, secondary and tertiary tumors shared the same histological and f ACS characteristics (Figures 1 1 H). Together these data demonstrate that LP tumors contained a distinct population of SCA 1 ''NGFRV tumor propagating ceils that could transplant disease retaining squamous characteristics. Example 7: Tumor propagating cells express high levels of PD-Ll Little is known about how tumor propagating ceils escape immunologic clearance and c nally expand to form malignant tumor nodules. To address this question, the PD-L l level on LP tumor cell fractions was further quantified. By gating the four SCA.1 ;NGFR fractions and analyzing the percentage of PD-Ll " cells in each fraction, a clear enrichment for PD-Ll " cells was found within the SCA 1 'NGF 1' fraction (Figure 13 A). Within a group of 7 mice, an average of 69% of SC I ' NGFR " cells expressed PD-Ll on their cell surface, while only 39% of SCA LNGFR' or 32% of SCA NGFR" cells were PD-Ll * (Figure 13B; p ::= 0,004). Likewise, by real-time RT PGR for Pd!l within the sorted LP tumor fractious, $CAl'fNGFR" cells had 7-fold more J¾// mR'NA than SCALNGFR'' cells and about 2-fold more than SCAfNGF'R* or SCAI "NGFR ÷ cells (Figure 13C; p = 0.035). Flow cytometr and real time RT-PCR were also used to assess PD-Ll levels in BASCs and basal ceils, NGFR" BASCs expressed the most PD-Ll in. the distal lung, while PD-Ll expression was uniformly high by flow cytometry in the trachea (Figures 14A-14B). in order to explore the relationship between NGFR ami PD-Li expression in patient tissue, human lung SCC tissue that were passaged in immunocompromised mice as Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDXs) were used (Figure I4C). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections from the PDX samples showed that the s uamous histology of the tumors was retained in the xenograft modei (Figure 13D). PDX sample were dissociated and stained with antibodies directed against human CD31 , CD45, EpCAM, NGFR and PD- Ll (Figure 14D), The amount of PD-L i staining on both EpCAM ! NGFR" and EpCAM ' NGFR' fractions was analyzed. Using 6 different PDX samples, PD-L i staining was 4.2-fold higher in the NGFR ' fraction relative to the NGFR' fraction of the human EpCAM"'" tumor cells (Figure 13E; p ::: 0.02). This trend was further confirmed with iiidependent human lung SCC tumor samples by staining serial sections for NGFR and PD- Li . Clearly, PD-L I is co-localized to the NGFR' cells within these tumors, indicating that the majority of NGFR" ceils co-express PD-LI (Figure I 3F). Therefore, in lung SCC, PD- Li is most abundantly expressed on tumor cells that express NGFR, and if these cells are analogous to the NGFR' cells in mouse tumors, they will also be enriched for TPC activity. Example 8: Arginase inhibitors modulate immune ceil populations and function to treat cancer in a variety of tumor models As described above, arginase 1 expression is significantly increased in LP tumor cells. Similarly, arginase 1 expression i enriched in ras G12D mutant mice, as opposed to EGFR mutant mice, as measured by both gene expression and immunohistochemicai analyses (Figures 15-16). The Krasl , Kras2, and Kras3 images shown in Figure 16 are from different tumors obtained from different Kras Gl 2D mutant mice. In general Kras mutant tumors (e.g., obtained from Kras G12D mutants, Kras GI 2D + Lkbl mutants, and Kras G12D p53 ÷ Lkbl mutants) express arginase 1 at a higher level than EGFR mutant tumors. Pten, Lkbl , and p53 tumors also express high levels of arginase 1 (see, for example, Xu et at. (2014) Cancer Ceil 25:590-604). Treatment of the Kras mutant mice with the arginase inhibitor, compound 9/HY- 15775, altered immune ceil populations and function. For example, after I week of short- term treatment with the arginase inhibitor compound at 30 mg/kg through once daily gavage, an increase in total T cell counts (Figure 17A), no change in CD! lc arid CD1 lb myeloid populations (Figure 17B), a decrease in the ratio fo CD4 T eels and an increase in CDS T cells in the total T ceil population (Figure .I 7C), and an increase in the ratio of CD8 to FoxP3 ceils (ie.f fee ratio of cytotoxic T cells to regulatory T cells) (Figure 17D) was determmed. Moreover, treatment of Krastd~D mice with compound 9/HY-l 5775 resulted in decreases in lung tumor volumes in the mice within 1 week (Figure 18). Thus, bi-alielic inaetivation of both Lkbl and Pten in the mouse lung leads to fully penetrant squamous cell carcinoma. When compared to lung Kras driven ADC models, the immune microeavironment of these SCCs was enriched for TANs. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that SCA1"NGFR+ tumor cells are enriched for tumor propagating ability and express hig levels of fee immune-evasion molecule PD-Ll . These tumors very closely recapitulate the gene expression profiles of the basal subtype of human lung SCC, indicating that these mice can serve as a valuable model for understanding progression and maintenance of basal lung SCCs. This SCC model are useful for the investigation of the nioiecuiar mechanisms of human SCC carcinogenesis and allow for further pre-clinical and co-clinical investigation of novel therapies aimed at eradicating lung tumors. Despite the fact that lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinom (SCC) occur at relatively equal frequencies world-wide, developing a genetic model of lung SCC ha been challenging. The Ad-Cre inhalation method may specifically target more distal Sung progenitors, thus selecting for tumor ceils-of-origm that predispose towards an ADC phenorype. Several studies have targeted deletion of squamous tumor suppressors, such as Plent or activation of squamous oncogenes, such as Sox 2. Despite these efforts, only partial SCC differentiation was observed in either model (Lu el at (2010) PLoS One 5 :e 11022; Malkoski e( at. (2013) Mol Car mog. (e-pub) doi: l 0.1.002/mc/22030). By contrast, it is demonstrated herein that deletion of both Pten and Lkbl, via the traditional Ad-Cre inhalation system, is able to produce lung tumors of purel squamous phenotype. Lkbl; Pten tumor lesions appeared to grow into the distal lung, suggesting that if basal cells are the cells-of-origin, they are able to migrate more disfaliy to propagate disease. When the expression of stem cell markers in normal lung tissue was examined, 100% of basal cells were SCAi 'f while -23% of BASCs were NGFR\ These data suggest an alternate possibility that a rare subset o NGFR ' BASCs could serve as distal eelis-of-origin for these rumors. SPC-CreER and CCSP-CreER both, failed to produce tumors when used with the Lkbl; Pten alleles , indicating that distal lung cells may not be the primary targets of oncogenic transformation in this model. Further examination of the cells of origin for these tumors, including the use of basal-eel! specific Cre strains or repetitive injury that targets particular cell populations, will help elucidate which lung cells can serve as precursors For these squamous tumors. As expected, the loss of both IJhl ant! Pt n in these tumors ac tivated the A T and mTOR pathways, likely driving cellular proliferation and femorigenesis. The deletion of these genes was also associated with the up-regulation of specific cytokines and other immune modulating proteins, leading to a unique tumor microenvironment. Compared to Krm tumor cells, the LP EpCAM ! ceils expressed very high levels of the ehemokmes CXCL3 and CXCL5, the BAL fluid contained elevated CXCL1 , CXCL2, CXCL5 and CXCL7. The CXC chemokine family controls the migration and adhesion of monocytes and neutrophils, mediating its effects on target cells by interacting with CXCR2 (Fold et al. (2004) Cancer Res, 64: 1853-1860). CXCL5, is also known as epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating peptide 78 (ENA-78), and its expression is associated with PI3K/AKT and Raf?ME /E K activation (Hsu el al (2012) Oncogene 32:4436-4447). Recent findings in tumor bearing mice and cancer patients indicate that the increased metabolism ofL-arginme by TANs producing arginasel can inhibit T cell lymphocyte responses (Raber t i (2012) Immunol. Invest, 41 :614-634), and it is likely that this mechanism is in play in the LP tumors. Furthermore, strong MPO staining in patient SCC tissues was observed, suggesting that activated TANs are a key component of SCC in both mouse and human, in addition to expression of the TAN-attracting cytokines, the LP EpCAlVf cells expressed high levels of the immune evasion molecule PD-LL Recently, there has been much excitement surrounding the potential of targeting molecules such as PD-Ll to 'reawaken' the immune system and cause tumor destruction, in the phase I study of nivolumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody to PD- L PD-Ll expression was determined by IHC in pre-treatment tumor biopsies of various tumor types (n— 42). 36% of patients whose tumors showed PD-Ll expression achieved objective response to nivolumab treatment (9/25), while none of the patients with PD-Ll negative tumors showed any objective response (0/1 7), although some achieved prolonged stable disease (Topalian et al. (2012) N. Engl. J. Med. 366:2443-2454). These data indicate that PD-L i expression influences response to anti-PD-1 antibody therapy. With the accumulation of clinical data, the actual correlation between PD-Ll expression and response to anti-PD- l. therapy should become clearer. fntriguingiy, the TPCs within the SCC model showed enrichment for PD-L l expression, suggesting that TPCs have unique immune evasion properties. Strikingly, it was found that the SCAT! GFRJ : ceil population had enhanced tumor-propagating activity compared to other tumor ceil populations. The studies described herein compared three tumor cell populations from murine SCC, and the SCArNGFiT population could not be assessed due to low abundance. Thus, there could be additional IPCs to characterize in Lkhl;Pieii SCCs. Furthermore, while PDX analyses showed that NGFR human SCC ceils are enriched for PD-LI , the identity of TPCs in 'human SCC has not been established with a functional assay. SCAI as a IPC marker is not useful for human cell studies, and markers in addition to NGFR may be required to enrich for propagating activity from primary patient SCCs. It may be possible to first debulk tumors with a more generally targeted inhibitor or surgery, and then prevent tumor recurrence and/or metastasis through administration of anti-PD- i therapy to target TPCs. Together these data demonstrate the poten tial of immunotherapy for the treatmen t of lung SCC and lay the groundwork for further investigation into the response of both cancer cells and the immune microenvironment to such treatments. incorporation by Reference Ail publications, patents, and patent applications mentioned herein are hereby irscoiporated by reference in their entirety as if each, individual publication, patent or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.
