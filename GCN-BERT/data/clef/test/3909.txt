This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/EP2013/073521 having an international filing date of Nov. 11, 2013, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, and which claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119 to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/726,154 filed Nov. 14, 2012, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The present invention relates to organic compounds useful for therapy and/or prophylaxis in a mammal of an inflammatory disease or disorder, and in particular to Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channel antagonists, their manufacture and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The invention relates in particular to a compound of formula (I) wherein: X is —CH2— or oxygen;Y is —(CH2)n—;R1 is phenyl optionally substituted with halogen;R2 is lower alkyl;R3 is trifluoromethyl-phenyl, trifluoromethyl-pyridinyl, trifluoromethyl-pyridazinyl, trifluoromethyl-pyrimidinyl or trifluoromethyl-pyrazinyl; andn is 0 or 1, provided that n is not 0 when X is oxygen;or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof TRP channels are a class of ion channels found on the plasma membrane of a variety of human (and other animal) cell types. There are at least 28 known human TRP channels which are broken into a number of families or groups based upon sequence homology and function. TRPA1 is a non-selective cation conducting channel that modulates membrane potential via flux of sodium, potassium and calcium. TRPA1 has been shown to be highly expressed in the human dorsal root ganglion neurons and peripheral sensory nerves. In humans, TRPA1 is activated by a number of reactive compounds such as acrolein, allylisothiocyanate, ozone as well as unreactive compounds such as nicotine and menthol and is thus thought to act as a ‘chemosensor’. Many of the known TRPA1 agonists are irritants that cause pain, irritation and neurogenic inflammation in humans and other animals. Therefore, it would be expected that TRPA1 antagonists or agents that block the biological effect of TRPA1 channel activators would be useful in the treatment of diseases such as asthma and its exacerbations, chronic cough and related maladies as well as being useful for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Recently, it has also been shown that products of tissue damage and oxidative stress, e.g. 4-hydroxynonenal and related compounds, activate the TRPA1 channel. This finding provides additional rationale for the utility of small molecule TRPA1 antagonists in the treatment of diseases related to tissue damage, oxidative stress and bronchial smooth muscle contraction such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), occupational asthma, and virally-induced lung inflammation. The invention also provides for pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, methods of using the compounds and methods of preparing the compounds. Unless otherwise indicated, the following specific terms and phrases used in the description and claims are defined as follows: The term “moiety” refers to an atom or group of chemically bonded atoms that is attached to another atom or molecule by one or more chemical bonds thereby forming part of a molecule. For example, the variables R1 to R3 of formula (I) refer to moieties that are attached to the core structure of formula (I) by a covalent bond. In reference to a particular moiety with one or more hydrogen atoms, the term “substituted” refers to the fact that at least one of the hydrogen atoms of that moiety is replaced by another substituent or moiety. For example, the term “lower alkyl substituted by halogen” refers to the fact that one or more hydrogen atoms of a lower alkyl (as defined below) is replaced by one or more halogen atoms (e.g., trifluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, fluoromethyl, chloromethyl, etc.). The term “alkyl” refers to an aliphatic straight-chain or branched-chain saturated hydrocarbon moiety having 1 to 20 carbon atoms. In particular embodiments the alkyl has 1 to 10 carbon atoms. The term “lower alkyl” refers to an alkyl moiety having 1 to 7 carbon atoms. In particular embodiments the lower alkyl has 1 to 4 carbon atoms and in other particular embodiments the lower alkyl has 1 to 3 carbon atoms. Examples of lower alkyls include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl. Particular examples of lower alkyl are methyl, ethyl and isopropyl. The terms “halo”, “halogen” and “halide”, which may be used interchangeably, refer to a substituent fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo. Fluoro is a particular example of halogen. Unless otherwise indicated, the term “hydrogen” or “hydro” refers to the moiety of a hydrogen atom (—H) and not H2. Unless otherwise indicated, the term “a compound of the formula” or “a compound of formula” or “compounds of the formula” or “compounds of formula” refers to any compound selected from the genus of compounds as defined by the formula (including any pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester of any such compound if not otherwise noted). The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free bases or free acids, which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. Salts may be formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, preferably hydrochloric acid, and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, salicylic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, N-acetylcystein and the like. In addition, salts may be prepared by the addition of an inorganic base or an organic base to the free acid. Salts derived from an inorganic base include, but are not limited to, the sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, and magnesium salts and the like. Salts derived from organic bases include, but are not limited to salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, ethanolamine, lysine, arginine, N-ethylpiperidine, piperidine, polyamine resins and the like. The compounds of the present invention can be present in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The compounds of the present invention can also be present in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable esters (i.e., the methyl and ethyl esters of the acids of formula (I) to be used as prodrugs). The compounds of the present invention can also be solvated, i.e. hydrated. The solvation can be effected in the course of the manufacturing process or can take place i.e. as a consequence of hygroscopic properties of an initially anhydrous compound of formula (I) (hydration). Compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “isomers” and fall within the scope of the invention. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “stereoisomers.” Diastereomers are stereoisomers with opposite configuration at one or more chiral centers which are not enantiomers. Stereoisomers bearing one or more asymmetric centers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed “enantiomers.” When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, if a carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center or centers and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (−)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a “racemic mixture”. The term “a therapeutically effective amount” of a compound means an amount of compound that is effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of disease or prolong the survival of the subject being treated. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is within the skill in the art. The therapeutically effective amount or dosage of a compound according to this invention can vary within wide limits and may be determined in a manner known in the art. Such dosage will be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case including the specific compound(s) being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, as well as the patient being treated. In general, in the case of oral or parenteral administration to adult humans weighing approximately 70 Kg, a daily dosage of about 0.1 mg to about 5,000 mg, 1 mg to about 1,000 mg, or 1 mg to 100 mg may be appropriate, although the lower and upper limits may be exceeded when indicated. The daily dosage can be administered as a single dose or in divided doses, or for parenteral administration, it may be given as continuous infusion. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” is intended to include any and all material compatible with pharmaceutical administration including solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and other materials and compounds compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions of the invention is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. Useful pharmaceutical carriers for the preparation of the compositions hereof, can be solids, liquids or gases; thus, the compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, suppositories, powders, enterically coated or other protected formulations (e.g. binding on ion-exchange resins or packaging in lipid-protein vesicles), sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, and the like. The carrier can be selected from the various oils including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. Water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols are preferred liquid carriers, particularly (when isotonic with the blood) for injectable solutions. For example, formulations for intravenous administration comprise sterile aqueous solutions of the active ingredient(s) which are prepared by dissolving solid active ingredient(s) in water to produce an aqueous solution, and rendering the solution sterile. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, talc, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The compositions may be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical additives such as preservatives, stabilizing agents, wetting or emulsifying agents, salts for adjusting osmotic pressure, buffers and the like. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulation are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will, in any event, contain an effective amount of the active compound together with a suitable carrier so as to prepare the proper dosage form for proper administration to the recipient. In the practice of the method of the present invention, an effective amount of any one of the compounds of this invention or a combination of any of the compounds of this invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, is administered via any of the usual and acceptable methods known in the art, either singly or in combination. The compounds or compositions can thus be administered orally (e.g., buccal cavity), sublingually, parenterally (e.g., intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously), rectally (e.g., by suppositories or washings), transdermally (e.g., skin electroporation) or by inhalation (e.g., by aerosol), and in the form of solid, liquid or gaseous dosages, including tablets and suspensions. The administration can be conducted in a single unit dosage form with continuous therapy or in a single dose therapy ad libitum. The therapeutic composition can also be in the form of an oil emulsion or dispersion in conjunction with a lipophilic salt such as pamoic acid, or in the form of a biodegradable sustained-release composition for subcutaneous or intramuscular administration.

Examples of respiratory disorder are chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), asthma, allergic rhinitis or bronchospasm. The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds generally are either available from commercial suppliers, such as Aldrich Chemical Co., or are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references such as Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis; Wiley & Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-15; Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989, Volumes 1-5 and Supplementals; and Organic Reactions, Wiley & Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-40. The following synthetic reaction schemes are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes can be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to the disclosure contained in this application. The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes can be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to, filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. Such materials can be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data. Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature range of from about −78° C. to about 150° C., more preferably from about 0° C. to about 125° C., and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20° C. Compounds of the invention may be made by any number of conventional means. For example, they may be made according to the processes outlined in Scheme 1. As described in Scheme 1, the N-substituted glycine ester (ii) can react with sulfonyl chloride (i) in the presence of base, such as triethylamine, to form the intermediate sulfonamide (iii), where R can be methyl or ethyl groups, R1 can be aryl, heteroaryl and aryl substituted with halogens, and R2 can be lower alkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl or isopropyl groups. The hydrolysis of ester (iii) under mild conditions, such as aqueous lithium hydroxide solution in THF, can provide the desired intermediate carboxylic acid (iv). The coupling reaction between the cyclic amine (v) and the arylbromide (vi) under palladium catalysis conditions can provide the N-aryl intermediate (vii). R4 is trifluoromethyl. The general Buchwald amination reaction conditions can be used to accomplish the N-arylation reaction. The detailed description can be found in the preparation procedure of the corresponding intermediates. For compound (v), the n number can be 0 or 1 (five or six membered cyclic amine). When the number n is 0, the X is (CH2). When the number n is 1, the X can be (CH2) or oxygen. For compound (vi), X, Y and Z can be (CH) or N. The cleavage of the butoxycarbonyl group in (vii) can give the corresponding primary amine (viii), which can be stored either as the free amine or the hydrochloride salt. Finally, the coupling between the carboxylic acid (iv) and the amine (viii) in the presence of coupling reagents can afford the desired compound (ix). The coupling reagents used in peptide chemistry for amide formation can be used. The detailed conditions can be found in the examples. The invention thus also relates to a process for the manufacture of a compound of formula (I) comprising the reaction of a compound of formula (A) in the presence of a compound of formula (B) a coupling agent and a base, wherein R1 to R3 are as defined above. Examples of coupling agents useful in the process of the invention are known amide formation coupling agents, like for example HATU. Diisopropylethylamine is an example of suitable base for the above process. The invention thus also relates to a compound of formula (I) when manufactured by the process of the invention.
