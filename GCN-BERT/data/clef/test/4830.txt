FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to the field of therapies for neurological, psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, in particular, to therapeutically active tetrahydroprotoberbine compounds, including stereochemically pure compounds, and their use in the treatment of such diseases. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Dysfunction of the brain ascending dopaminergic system is responsible for a wide array of severe neuropsychiatric conditions, affecting millions of people in North America and Europe. Schizophrenia, for example, is a chronic and debilitating neurological disorder that is characterized by the presentation of positive symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive impairments. It is believed that an imbalance in the dopaminergic system (subcortical excess and cortical deficiency) is involved in the pathophysiological processes of schizophrenia (see, for example, Abi-Dargham, A., 2004, Int. J. Neuropsychopharmacol., 7 Suppl. 1:S1-S5). It is believed that decreased activity of the D1 receptors in the PFC may play a significant role in the expression of negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenic patients. However, almost all currently available antipsychotic drugs are D2 dopamine receptor antagonist with some extent of serotonergic activities. As such, these antipsychotic drugs are only moderately effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and are not effective in treating the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in these patients. Cognitive impairment mediated by hypoactivity in the prefronal cortex (PFC) is commonly observed in schizophrenic individuals (Goldman-Rakic, 1999, Biol Psych 46(5):650-661; Weinberger et al., 2001, Biol Psych 50(11):825-844; Seamans and Yang, 2004, Prog in Neurobiol 74(1):1-58). Clinical data suggest a beneficial relationship between improved cognition and positive social and clinical outcomes (Andreasen, 2000, Brain Res Brain Res Rev 31(2-3):106-112), but development of effective treatments to address cognitive deficits seen in psychotic patients has been challenging. Preclinical studies provide strong support for the hypothesis that optimal dopamine concentrations in the frontal lobes facilitate cognitive function (Goldman-Rakic, 1995, Neuron 14(3):477-485; Phillips et al., 2004, J Neurosci, 24(2):547-553). Increasing the bioavailability of dopamine or local stimulation of dopamine receptors in the frontal cortex is effective in animals to improve cognitive function in circumstances where cognitive performance is suboptimal (Fletcher et al., 1996, J Neurosci 16(21):7055-7062; Hotte et al., 2005, Neurobiol Learn Mem 84(2):85-92; Floresco & Phillips, 2001, Behav Neurosci 204(2):396-409; Tunbridge et al., 2004, J Neurosci 24(23):5331-5335; Lapish et al., 2009, Psychopharm 202(1-3):521-530). Accordingly, pharmacotherapies that restore optimal PFC dopamine levels or activity at PFC dopamine receptors, may yield an effective pro-cognitive treatment strategy. Tetrahydroprotoberberines (THPBs) are a series of alkaloids isolated from plants. Chemically, the compound l-stepholidine (also known as (−)-stepholidine or (S)-stepholidine), which is isolated from roots of the Chinese herb Stephania intermedica lo, is a prototypical member of the THPBs characterized by a tetracyclic ring skeleton, an isoquinoline core, and a chiral carbon at C(14) (see FIG. 1). l-stepholidine (l-SPD) appears to exhibit unique pharmacological activities in its ability to elicit activities in both the D1 and D2 receptors in vitro and in vivo (Gao et al., 2007, Acta Pharmacol Sin., 28(5):627-33; Jin et al., 2002, Trends Pharmacol Sci., 23(1):4-7; Mo et al., 2007, Curr Med Chem., 14(28):2996-3002; Mo et al., 2008, Neurobiol Aging, August 14, [Epub ahead of print]). Synthesis of racemic dl-SPD and enantioselective synthesis of l-SPD have been reported (Chiang & Brochmann-Hanssen, 1977, J Org Chem., 42:3190-3194; Cheng et al., 2009, J Org Chem., 74(23):9225-8). l-govadine is another example of a THPB that has been isolated from natural sources (Hu et al., 1998, Zhongguo Yaowu Huaxue Zazhi, 8:190-195). The synthesis of racemic govadine has been reported (Hu et al., 1998, ibid, Kametani & Satoh, 1967, J. Pharm. Soc. Jpn, 179; Chiang & Brochmann-Hanssen, 1977, ibid.; Chiang, et al., 1978, Taiwan Yaoxue Zazhi, 54:30; Kametani & Ihara, 1980, J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1, 629; Yongzhou, 1998, Chinese J. Med. Chem., 8:190; Mehra, et al., 1976, Indian J. Chem., Sect B, 14B:216). These routes access the desired tetrahydroisoquinoline core utilizing racemic reductions of the corresponding dihydroisoquinoline. Investigations into the activity of certain THPBs has suggested that the l- and d-enantiomers of the compounds may possess different activities. Clement-Cormier et al. (1979, Biochemical Pharmacology, 28:3123-3129) reported that optical isomers of 2,3,10,11-THPB showed different activities in the antagonism of the dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase, as did positional isomers and methylated derivatives. Jin et al. (1984, Scientia Sinica, 29:1054-1064) investigated the activities of l- and d-tetrahydropalmitine (THP) on the dopaminergic system. The results obtained in this study indicated that d-THP had no affinity for the dopamine receptors and demonstrated different effects on DOPA accumulation and dopamine levels than the l-isomer, leading the authors to conclude that l-THP is a dopamine receptor antagonist, whereas d-THP is a dopamine depletor. Similarly, Shou-Xi et al. (1989, Acta Pharmalogica Sinica, 10:104-110) compared the affinity of l- and d-THP for the dopamine D1 and D2 receptors and concluded that d-THP has no affinity for the D2 receptor. Later functional studies on l- and d-THP led to the same conclusion (Sun et al., 1992, Acta Pharmalogica Sinica, 13:292-297; Cao et al., 1993, Asia Pacific J Pharmacology, 8:61-65). Zhang and Jin (1996, Acta Pharmalogica Sinica, 17:18-22) compared the effects of (−)-SPD (l-SPD) with chloroscoulerine (CSL) enantiomers on the dopamine D1 and D2 receptors and concluded that CSL enantiomers, like l-SPD, are D1/D2 mixed antagonists, and that while all the compounds tested were D2 antagonists, (+)-CSL was a very weak one. Chen et al. (1999, Acta Pharmalogica Sinica, 20:884-888) investigated the pharmacological behaviour of CSL enantiomers on dopamine receptors, in particular the activity of CSL enantiomers in behavioural tests in mice and rats. The study determined that d-CSL had a weaker affinity for the D1 receptor and a much weaker affinity for the D2 receptor than l-CSL, and that while both enantiomers inhibited apomorphine-induced stereotypy, catalepsy and amphetamine-induced jumping in test animals, d-CSL showed a weaker effect in all tests. l-SPD has been the subject of extensive preclinical research primarily motivated by its ability to dynamically target dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (Mo et al., 2007, Current Medicinal Chemistry, 14:2996-3002; Natesan et al., 2008, Psychopharmacology, 199:275-289). Preclinical measures of antipsychotic efficacy such as attenuated psychostimulant induced locomotion, disrupted CAR, and the induction of catalepsy, provide evidence of l-SPD's dopamine D2 antagonism (Natesan et al. 2008, ibid.). dl-Govadine, which has a core structure similar to that of l-SPD, has been characterized as a noradrenaline α1 antagonist in peripheral cardiovascular tissue (Guh et al., 1999, European J. Pharmacology, 374:503-510. Ko et al., 1996, J. Pharmacy and Pharmacology, 48:629-634). Receptor binding assays showed dl-govadine to have a higher affinity than l-SPD for the dopamine D1 receptor, but a lower affinity for the D2 receptor (Hu et al., 1998, ibid).

No admission is necessarily intended, nor should be construed, that any of the preceding information constitutes prior art against the present invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, the present invention provides a class of stereochemically pure tetrahydroprotoberbine (THPB) compounds and for their use in the treatment of neurological, psychiatric (including neuropsychiatric) and neurodegenerative diseases. These compounds may generally be referred to as “d-THPB” compounds, where “d-THPB” is defined as indicated below. As described herein, d-govadine, a representative d-THPB compound of general formula (I), while showing an affinity for both the D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in vitro, has been shown surprisingly to increase dopamine release in the brain, indicating that d-govadine has dopamine agonistic activity, despite the antagonistic activity suggested by the in vitro receptor affinities. Moreover, while l-govadine induced an increase in dopamine in the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex, d-govadine induced an increase in dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex only. In contrast to l-govadine, d-govadine also increases cognitive function. Accordingly, certain embodiments of the invention contemplate that d-govadine and other d-THPB compounds of general formula (I) will be useful in pharmacological contexts and, in particular in the treatment of neurological, psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases in which dopamine agonistic activity and/or cognitive enhancement would be beneficial. A readily scalable enantioselective synthetic pathway for synthesis of compounds of general formula (I) is also provided. As also demonstrated herein, racemic govadine is also effective in increasing dopamine release in the brain and both l-govadine and racemic govadine show properties associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs. In addition, racemic govadine, like d-govadine, shows a cognitive enhancing effect. In another aspect, therefore, the present invention provides for the use of govadine in the treatment of neurological, psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Govadine may be provided in the form of d-govadine, l-govadine or racemic govadine. Certain embodiments of the invention also provide for the use of d-govadine and racemic govadine as cognitive enhancers. Some embodiments of the invention provide for the use of l-govadine and racemic govadine as anti-psychotics. A readily scalable enantioselective synthetic pathway for synthesis of d-govadine and l-govadine is also provided.

Govadine In one aspect of the invention relates to govadine, including d-govadine (53), l-govadine (62), and racemic govadine (63). Also encompassed by certain embodiments of the invention are intermediates in the preparation of stereochemically pure d-govadine or l-govadine, such as compounds of formulae (XIV) and (XV), in which R12 is a protecting group, including compounds 22 and 23, and salts thereof. Salts, Solvates and Prodrugs Certain embodiments of the invention relate to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs of the compounds defined above. Compounds according to the present invention can possess a sufficiently acidic, a sufficiently basic, or both functional groups, and accordingly react with a number of organic and inorganic bases, and organic and inorganic acids, to form pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” as used herein, refers to a salt of a compound, which is substantially non-toxic to living organisms. Typical pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acid or an organic or inorganic base. Such salts are known as acid addition and base addition salts. Acids commonly employed to form acid addition salts include, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, and organic acids such as p-toluenesulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, oxalic acid, p-bromophenylsulphonic acid, carbonic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, acetic acid, and the like. Examples of such pharmaceutically acceptable salts are the sulphate, pyrosulphate, bisulphate, sulphite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, bromide, iodide, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, hydrochloride, dihydrochloride, isobutyrate, caproate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, butyne-1,4-dioate, hexyne-1,6-dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, xylenesulphonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, glycolate, tartrate, methanesulphonate, propanesulphonate, naphthalene-1-sulfonate, napththalene-2-sulfonate, mandelate and the like. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are those formed with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, and those formed with organic acids such as maleic acid and methanesulphonic acid. Salts of amine groups may also comprise quarternary ammonium salts in which the amino nitrogen carries a suitable organic group such as an alkyl, lower alkenyl, substituted lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, substituted lower alkynyl, or aralkyl moiety. Base addition salts include those derived from inorganic bases, such as ammonium or alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, and the like. Bases useful in preparing salts thus include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, and the like. One skilled in the art will understand that the particular counterion forming a part of a salt in accordance with the present invention is usually not of a critical nature, so long as the salt as a whole is pharmacologically acceptable and as long as the counterion does not contribute undesired qualities to the salt as a whole. Certain embodiments provide for pharmaceutically acceptable solvates of the compounds of the invention. For example, many of the compounds described above can combine with solvents such as water, methanol, ethanol and acetonitrile to form pharmaceutically acceptable solvates such as the corresponding hydrate, methanolate, ethanolate and acetonitrilate. Certain embodiments provide the compounds of the invention in a prodrug form. The term “prodrug” as used herein refers to a compound that has undergone a chemical derivation such as substitution or addition of a further chemical group to change (for pharmaceutical use) one or more of its physico-chemical properties, and that yields the active compound per se by one or a series of metabolic transformations after administration to a subject. Physico-chemical properties that may be changed by conversion of the compound into a prodrug form include, for example, solubility, bioavailability, absorption, distribution, site specificity, stability, release characteristics, toxicity, and the like. Examples of chemical derivatives that may be prepared in order to convert a compound into a prodrug in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention include, but are not limited to, ester derivatives, ether derivatives, carbamate derivatives, amide derivatives, imine derivatives, and derivatization with an appropriate carrier moiety directly or via a linker group. Examples of prodrugs and methods of producing a prodrug of a given active compound are well known to those skilled in the art and can be found, for example, in Krogsgaard-Larsen et al., (Textbook of Drug Design and Discovery, Taylor & Francis, New York, N.Y. (April 2002)). The preparation of salts, solvates and prodrugs can be carried out by methods known in the art. It will be appreciated that non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or prodrugs also fall within the scope of the invention since those may be useful in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or prodrugs. Preparation of Govadine and Compounds of Formula I Tetrahydroprotoberbines of formula (I) can be prepared, for example, by a synthetic route as shown in Scheme 1, which involves the preparation of a key amide intermediate (IV) which can be produced by reacting amine (II) with acid (III) as starting materials, followed by the Bishler-Napieralski reaction with POCl3 to form the planar dihydroisoquinoline intermediate (V). It is to be understood that the steps shown in Scheme 1 and the following Schemes are the key steps of the synthetic route only and the inclusion of additional intermediary steps is not precluded. For example, in certain embodiments, steps converting free acids or base to salts, crystallization and/or re-crystallization steps, various purification steps, and the like may be inserted between one or more of the steps shown in the Schemes, as would be understood by a worker skilled in the art. Alternatively, in Scheme 1, acid (III) may be replaced with starting compound (XIII), in which X is OH or Cl. In certain embodiments, the intermediate (V) is reduced using a chiral reducing catalyst/reagent to produce intermediate (VI), followed by a Mannich-type cyclization, for example, Pictet-Spengler cyclization, of the compound (VI) to afford the desired entantiomer or diastereomer of compound (I), as shown in Scheme 2. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides for a synthetic route for preparing stereochemically pure THPBs comprising five main steps as shown in Scheme 3, in which intermediate (V) is reduced using a chiral reducing catalyst/reagent. The 5-step process can be used to produce either stereoisomer of the THPB by selection of the appropriate enantiomer of a chiral reducing catalyst/reagent to reduce intermediate (V) to produce either intermediate (VI) or intermediate (XII), which is followed by a Mannich-type cyclization to produce a tetrahydroprotoberbine of formula (I) or formula (XI), respectively. In certain embodiments, the invention provides for a synthetic route for preparing enantiomerically pure govadine comprising five main steps using the commercially available dopamine derivative 1 and homovanillic acid derivative 21 as starting materials as shown in Scheme 4. R12 is benzyl or another suitable protecting group. Suitable protecting groups can be readily selected by the skilled worker. Examples include, but are not limited to, methoxymethyl ethers, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl (SEM) ethers and 4-methoxybenzyl ethers. As in Scheme 3, this route comprises coupling readily available starting materials (XVIa,b) and (XVII) to provide amide (XVIII), followed by conversion of the amide intermediate (XVIII) to the planar dihydroisoquinoline intermediate (XIX), and reducing intermediate (XIX) using a chiral reducing catalyst/reagent. The route can be used to produce either enantiomer of govadine by selection of the appropriate enantiomer of the chiral reducing catalyst/reagent in order to reduce intermediate (XIX) to produce either intermediate (XIV) or intermediate (XV). A Mannich-type cyclization followed by removal of the protecting groups produces d- or l-govadine (53 and 62, respectively). Coupling of starting materials (XVIa,b) and (XVII) may be achieved by various methods known in the art for coupling peptides. Non-limiting examples are provided in Example 3. Other suitable methods include, but are not limited to, coupling reactions using a carbodiimide reagent (for example, N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC)) or an activated triazole reagent (for example, benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), 2-(1H-7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU), and 2-(6-chloro-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylaminium hexafluorophosphate HCTU). In certain embodiments, the coupling reaction is a thermal coupling reaction. In some embodiments, the coupling reaction is a thermal coupling reaction in the absence of solvent. Conversion of the intermediate (XVIII) to the dihydroisoquinoline intermediate (XIX) can be achieved, for example, by the Bishler-Napieralski reaction. The Bishler-Napieralski reaction typically employs condensation reagents such as P2O5, POCl3 or ZnCl2. In certain embodiments, the synthetic route comprises a Bishler-Napieralski reaction utilizing POCl3 as a condensation reagent. Suitable chiral reducing catalysts/reagents for reducing intermediate (XIX) include, for example, Noyori's catalyst (RuCl[(S,S)-TsDPEN(P-cymene)] or RuCl[(R,R)-TsDPEN(P-cymene)]) and other chiral catalysts known in the art. The Mannich-type cyclization of intermediate (XIV) or intermediate (XV) can be, for example, a Pictet-Spengler cyclization. In certain embodiments, the synthetic route comprises utilizing benzyl protecting groups as shown in Scheme 5. In certain embodiments, intermediate (VI), intermediate (XII), intermediate (XIV), intermediate (XV), compound 22 or compound 23 may be unstable and thus may be converted to an appropriate salt, for example, an HCl salt, by standard procedures prior to proceeding to the next step. In certain embodiments, the HCl salt may be recrystallized prior to proceeding to the next step. In accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, the synthetic route shown in Schemes 3 to 5 can be designed such that each intermediate may be purified by crystallization. The route is thus readily scalable as it does not require the use of flash chromatography. For example, preparation of intermediate (VI), intermediate (XVIII) or compound 3 by heating the respective starting (compounds (II) and (XIII), or (XVIa) and (XVII), or compounds 1 and 21a, in the absence of solvent, allows for the purification of intermediate (VI) or (XVIII), or compound 3 by crystallization. In certain embodiments, the synthetic route comprises the steps set out in Scheme 6: In certain embodiments in which the route depicted in Scheme 5 or 6 is carried out on a large scale, the benzyl protecting groups may be removed in a final step using HCl to minimize the possibility that some racemisation may occur. As an alternative to the enantioselective synthesis described above, in some embodiments, intermediate (V) may be reduced using a non-chiral reducing agent, such as NaBH4, to afford a racemic mixture of the compound (VIa), which is subjected to Pictet-Spengler cyclization to afford a racemic mixture of the compound of formula (Ia), which is then subjected to chiral resolution to obtain the stereochemically pure form of the compound (I), as shown in Scheme 7. In one embodiment the intermediate (VIa) can be prepared from amine (II) and aldehyde (X), followed by a Pictet-Spengler cyclization to afford a dl-tetrahydroprotoberberine derivative which is then resolved to obtain stereochemically pure compounds, as shown in Scheme 8. In some embodiments, the invention also encompasses the use of known stereochemically pure tetrahydroprotoberberine compounds, such as, compound 56 above. Compound 56 is commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.). In those embodiments that encompass l-govadine, this compound may be prepared synthetically, for example, as outlined above in Schemes 5 and 6, or it may be isolated from natural sources using methods known in the art. Likewise, for those embodiments that encompass racemic govadine, this compound may be prepared as shown in Schemes 7 and 8, or by other methods known in the art. Activity Testing In accordance with certain embodiments of the present invention, govadine and/or compounds of formula (I) are able to increase dopamine release in the brain, and in certain embodiments are able to increase dopamine release specifically in the prefrontal cortex. This activity can be tested by the microdialysis method described in the Examples provided herein and/or other standard testing methods known in the art (see, for example in Current Protocols in Neuroscience (Ed. Crawley et al., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, N.J.). In certain embodiments of the present invention, govadine and/or the compounds of formula (I) show a differential affinity for the D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. In one embodiment, compounds of formula (I) show a lower affinity for the D2 receptor as compared to their affinity for the D1 receptor. The affinity of the compounds for the D1 and D2 dopamine receptors can be assessed using standard methods known in the art, such as the methods described in the Examples provided herein. In certain embodiments, govadine and/or the compounds of formula (I) are able to increase cognitive function. This activity can be tested by the delayed win-shift methods described in the Examples provided herein or other standard testing methods known in the art (see, for example, Current Protocols in Neuroscience, Ed. Crawley et al., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, N.J.). Examples of the other tests that may be used to assess the activity of govadine and/or the compounds of formula (I) include, for example, the Novel Object Recognition (NOR) Test, the Pre-Pulse Inhibition Test, the Elevated X-Maze Test and the Water Maze Spatial Learning Test, as described briefly below, which test various cognitive functions. Other methods are known in the art, including those described in the Examples. Novel Object Recognition (NOR) Test This test is useful for evaluating the role of experimental manipulations on cognition. The recognition test is based on the natural tendency of rodents to investigate a novel object instead of a familiar one. The choice to explore the novel object reflects the use of learning and (recognition) memory processes. Novel Object Recognition (NOR) is based on the premise that rodents will explore a novel object more than a familiar one, but only if they remember the familiar one. Description I: Before training the animals with objects, they are first allowed to acclimatize to the testing environment, which is typically a box (for example made from white Perspex) equipped with an overhead camera. After an acclimation session, the animals are ready for the training stage. This stage involves the introduction of two identical objects to the environment before allowing the rodent to explore for a suitable period (for example, about five minutes). Following the training period, the rodent is removed from the environment for a delay period which can range from 5 minutes to about 48 hours, depending on the type of memory being tested. After the delay, the rodent is returned to the arena, where one of the original objects has been replaced by a new one, such as a glass container. Description II: In the two-trial novel object recognition task, a rodent is placed in an enclosure and exposed for a set length of time to two identical objects that are located a specified distance from each other. The rodent is then removed from the environment and a predetermined amount of time is allowed to pass. The subject is then retested in the same environment except that one of the two previously used (familiar) objects is replaced with a novel object that differs from the familiar object in shape, texture and appearance (such as, for example, plastic block is replaced with a metal ball), and the rodent's behaviour is recorded. The amount of time that the rodents spends exploring each object can be calculated by hand or by using a computer program receiving input from the overhead camera. The literature describes a variety of methods for analyzing results. One technique involves dividing the time spent exploring the novel object by the total time spent exploring either object, yielding % novel exploration. An alternative technique is used to calculate the discrimination ratio, defined as the difference in exploration time for the objects divided by total exploration time. The method of analysis should be suited to the specific experimental setup. Although simple by design, the NOR test is quite flexible. For instance, changing the duration of the delay period allows one to selectively test short-term or long-term memory. Alternatively, the NOR protocol can be used to selectively test the effects of an acute drug treatment on a specific stage of memory formation. The experimenter can manipulate memory encoding, consolidation or retrieval by injecting the drug prior to the training, delay or testing period, respectively. The desired result is a reduced exploratory time and enhanced spatial learning in response to a test agent in the NOR test. Pre-Pulse Inhibition Test The overall goal of this test is to evaluate the effect of an agent on sensory processing (which is a form of working memory). Pre-pulse inhibition is a procedure whereby a preceding stimulus attenuates the startle response. The reduced ability to filter out irrelevant auditory stimulation is a characteristic which is thought to contribute to certain manifestations of conditions including inattention, distractibility, and cognitive deficits. The test is useful for evaluating potential antipsychotic drugs. Prepulse Inhibition (PPI) is a neurological phenomenon in which a weaker pre-stimulus (pre-pulse) inhibits the reaction of an organism to a subsequent strong startling stimulus (pulse). The stimuli are usually acoustic, but tactile, light, airpuff stimuli are also used. The reduction of the amplitude of startle reflects the ability of the nervous system to temporarily adapt to a strong sensory stimulus when a preceding weaker signal is given to warn the organism. PPI is detected in numerous species ranging from mice to humans. Although the extent of the adaptation affects numerous systems, the most comfortable to measure are the muscular reactions, which are normally diminished as a result of the nervous inhibition. The following is an example of a PPI testing method. The test rodent is placed in a small chamber and exposed to a brief pulse of noise. The test is used to assess the subject's ability to “gate” or filter environmental information. In the acoustic (startle model) of sensorimotor gating, a weak acoustic stimulus (i.e. the pre-pulse) decreases the reflexive flinching response (startle) produced by a second, more intense, stimulus (the pulse). The main three parts of the procedure are pre-pulse, startle stimulus, and startle reflex. Different pre-pulse-to-pulse intervals, or lead intervals, can be used, for example 30, 60, 120, 240 and 480 ms. Lead interval counts from the start of pre-pulse to the start of the pulse. With the interval exceeding 500 ms, prepulse facilitation, such as increased response, is most likely to follow. Burst of white noise is usually used as acoustic startle stimulus. Typical durations are 20 ms for pre-pulse and 40 ms for pulse. Background noise of 30-40 dB is typically used in rodent experiments. Pre-pulse is typically set 3-12 dB louder than background. Startle response is measured in rodents using the so-called automated “startle chambers” or “stabilimeter chambers,” with detectors recording whole-body reaction. “Pulse alone” results are compared to “pre-pulse plus pulse,” and the percentage of the reduction in the startle reflex represents pre-pulse inhibition. Elevated X-Maze Test The elevated X-Maze, otherwise known as the Elevated Plus Maze, is a test that relies on the inherent conflict between exploration of a novel area and avoidance of its aversive features. The test may be used in male or female rats or mice, or in male gerbils. The maze consists of four arms in the form of an x or plus: two open arms and two arms of the same size, also with an open roof but enclosed by walls. The two open arms are opposite each other and converge into a central platform. The animal under investigating is observed by a video camera and its movements scored, for example by the tracking software. During the experiment the animal is placed on the central platform of the maze facing an open arm and is observed for a specified time period, for example 5 minutes, with the following being measured: number of entries into open arms, number of entries into closed arms, time spent in open arms, time spent in closed arms and finally the time spent in the central square (File et al., Current Protocols in Neuroscience (2004) 8.3.1-8.3.22). Water Maze Spatial Learning Test The Morris Water Maze (MWM) is a test of spatial learning for rodents that relies on distal cues to navigate from start locations around the perimeter of an open swimming arena to locate a submerged escape platform. Spatial learning is assessed across repeated trials and reference memory is determined by preference for the platform area when the platform is absent. The test apparatus consists of a large circular pool (typical dimensions: about 1 m diameter and about 80 cm high, with the water at a temperature of about 26° C.) with a platform (for example, about 11 cm diameter) submerged approximately 1.5 cm below the surface. Both the pool and the platform can be constructed of black polyvinyl plastic, which offers no intra-maze cues. The experimental room may contain several extra-maze visual cues. During training, the platform is hidden in the same quadrant approximately 30 cm away from the edge of the maze. Several trials can be conducted, each beginning with the rat facing the wall of the maze in a different location. The time taken for the rat to find the platform within a specified time period is recorded. Probe trials where the platform is removed from the maze and the time the animal spent in the target quadrant can also be performed. Govadine and compounds of formula (I) may also be tested for their efficacy in various animal models of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, such as animal models of schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, ADHD, dyskinesia, addiction and the like (see, for example, Current Protocols in Neuroscience, Ed. Crawley et al., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, N.J.). Pharmaceutical Compositions The compounds of the present invention are typically formulated prior to administration. The present invention thus provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising govadine or one or more compounds of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient. The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by known procedures using well-known and readily available ingredients. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds may be administered orally (including, for example, buccally or sublingually), topically, parenterally, by inhalation or spray, or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intradermal, intra-articular, intravenous, intramuscular, intravascular, intrasternal, intrathecal injection or infusion techniques. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared in either solid or fluid unit dosage forms. Fluid unit dosage form can be prepared according to procedures known in the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavouring agents, colouring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. An elixir is prepared by using a hydroalcoholic (for example, ethanol) vehicle with suitable sweeteners such as sugar and saccharin, together with an aromatic flavoring agent. Suspensions can be prepared with an aqueous vehicle with the aid of a suspending agent such as acacia, tragacanth, methylcellulose and the like. Solid formulations such as tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate: granulating and disintegrating agents for example, corn starch, or alginic acid: binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc and other conventional ingredients such as dicalcium phosphate, magnesium aluminum silicate, calcium sulfate, starch, lactose, methylcellulose, and functionally similar materials. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil. Soft gelatin capsules are prepared by machine encapsulation of a slurry of the compound with an acceptable vegetable oil, light liquid petrolatum or other inert oil. Aqueous suspensions contain active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxylmethylcellulose, methyl cellulose, hydropropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia: dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example hepta-decaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl-p-hydroxy benzoate, one or more colouring agents, one or more flavouring agents or one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredients in a vegetable oil, for example peanut oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide palatable oral preparations. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid. Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oil phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or peanut oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol, anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents that have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or a suspension in a non-toxic parentally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. Adjuvants such as local anaesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can also be included in the injectable solution or suspension. Compositions formulated for rectal administration are usually in the form of suppositories. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the compound with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the compound. Such materials include cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. Other pharmaceutical compositions and methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions are known in the art and are described, for example, in “Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy” (formerly “Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences”); Gennaro, A., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Philidelphia, Pa. (2000). Administration Govadine and compounds of Formula I may be administered to a subject by a variety of routes depending on the disease to be treated, for example, in various embodiments the compounds may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation or spray, or rectally in dosage unit formulations. The dosage to be administered is not subject to defined limits, but it will usually be an effective amount. It will usually be the equivalent, on a molar basis of the pharmacologically active free form produced from a dosage formulation upon the metabolic release of the active free drug to achieve its desired pharmacological and physiological effects. The compositions may be formulated in a unit dosage form. The term “unit dosage form” refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other animals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Examples of ranges for the compound(s) in each dosage unit are from about 0.05 to about 100 mg, or more usually, from about 1.0 to about 50 mg. Daily dosages of the compounds of the invention will typically fall within the range of about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight, in single or divided dose. However, it will be understood that the actual amount of the compound(s) to be administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms. The above dosage range is given by way of example only and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing harmful side effects, for example, by first dividing the larger dose into several smaller doses for administration throughout the day. The present invention also contemplates that govadine and the compounds of formula (I) may be administered as part of a combination therapy as described in more detail below.

EXAMPLES Preparation of Compounds: Materials Tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dichloromethane and benzene were purified using the MBRAUN MB-SPS solvent purification system. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Whatman Partisil K6F UV254 pre-coated TLC plates. All chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. Instrumentation Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterochloroform using a Bruker AV-300 or AV-400 spectrometer. Carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterochloroform or CD3OD using a Bruker AV-400 spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) and are referenced to the centerline of deuterochloroform (7.27 ppm 1H NMR; 77.0 ppm 13C NMR) or CD3OD (3.31 ppm 1H NMR; 49.0 ppm 13C NMR). Low resolution mass spectra (LRMS) and high resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on either a Bruker Esquire-LC spectrometer (for LRMS) or a Waters/Micromass LCT spectrometer (for HRMS). Optical rotations were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter. Example 1 Preparation of D-Govadine a) Synthesis of Amide 3: An intimate mixture of 10.88 g (40.0 mmol) of carboxylic acid 2, and 10.28 g (40.0 mol) of amine 1, contained in a 100 mL flask was evacuated and refilled with nitrogen. The flask was placed in an oil bath at 170° C. while passing a slow continuous stream of argon over the solid. When the solid had completely melted, the mixture was heated for 3.0 h while passing nitrogen over the melt to sweep out the H2O formed. The melt was cooled to room temperature, and the residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (180 mL). The solution was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (2×50 mL), aqueous HCl (10%, 2×40 mL), and brine (80 mL). The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation to provide a yellow solid, which was recrystallized from hot ethyl acetate to provide the amide 3 (19.04 g, 90%) as a white solid. Mp: 118-120° C. (Lit.1 mp: 129-130.5° C.).

The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was washed with petroleum ether (2×30 mL) and re-crystallized from MeOH/diether ether to afford the imine as the HCl salt 4 (6.84 g, 86%). Mp: 190-191° C. (lit.1 Mp: 195-198° C.).

The free imine was dissolved in dry DMF (25 mL) and the solution was degassed for 15 min with nitrogen. RuCl[(S,S)-TsDPEN(P-cymene)] (38 mg, 1 mol %) was added followed by a 5:2 mixture of formic acid/triethylamine (5.0 mL), and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 9 h under nitrogen. The reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (100 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3×50 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. The crude greenish product is reasonably pure, but unstable at room temperature. The crude greenish product was therefore converted into its HCl salt by treatment with conc. HCl-MeOH-diether ether solution at −20° C. to afford compound 5 as light greenish solid (2.59 g, 81%).

The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and concentrated to about 10 mL under reduced pressure and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 was added until pH>7 was reached. The mixture was then extracted with CH2Cl2 (3×40 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (2×30 mL), water (30 mL), brine (30 mL), dried with MgSO4 and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The crude yellow product was dissolved in MeOH and conc. HCl (1 mL) was added followed by adding diethyl ether.

The reaction mixture was cooled to 0° C. and basified with concentrated ammonia solution (30 mL). The mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to give the crude product, which was purified by column chromatography (CH2Cl2/CH3OH=50/1) to yield 616 mg of the title compound (72%, >99% ee).

Example 2 Alternative Methods of Preparing Amide 3 Known peptide couplings between dopamine derivative 1 and homovanillic acid derivative 21 were investigated to determine which conditions provided the highest yields and which could be purified by crystallization. The results are shown in Table 1 below. Conversion of carboxylic acid 21a to the corresponding acid chloride 21b using thionyl chloride was first explored, followed by coupling with amine 1 (Entry 1 in Table 1). This protocol only afforded modest yields (50-60%) of amide 3 and the reaction was not clean, thus necessitating purification by flash column chromatography. Peptide coupling using DCC and hydroxysuccinimide provided amide 3 in a slightly lower yield (40-50%), but the product could still not be isolated cleanly by crystallization (Entry 2). Next a thermal peptide coupling between amine 1 and acid 21a (Entry 3). Although these conditions have never been explored with either 1 or 21a, they have been demonstrated to be successful when coupling comparable dopamine and homovanillic acid derivatives. Gratifyingly, heating the two species neat at 180° C. provided clean conversion to the desired coupled product, which could readily be purified by re-crystallization. Thermal peptide couplings were also attempted using a microwave reactor, but there was significant decomposition (Entry 4).

Example 5 Chiral Resolution of d,l-Tetrahydroprotoberbine 1.64 g of racemate amine 31 (3.33 mmol) in 50 mL of ethyl acetate was added 1.312 g (3.4 mmol) of 2,3-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid and refluxed for 4 h. The precipitated solid was filtered and recrystallized from MeOH/EtOAc to afford 960 mg white solid as the chiral salt. The salt was suspended in 40 mL of DCM and neutralized with aqueous ammonium. The organic layer was separated, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 486 mg (30%) of the L-amine 32a. The filtrate was washed with aqueous ammonium, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and was added 1.158 g (3.0 mmol) of 2,3-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid and refluxed for 4 h. The precipitated solid was filtered and recrystallized from MeOH/EtOAc to afford 932 mg white solid as the chiral salt. The salt was suspended in 40 mL of DCM and neutralized with aqueous ammonium. The organic layer was separated, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 448 mg (27%) of the D-amine 32b. Conversion of Compounds 32a and 32b to Govadine 53 32b (486 mg, 0.986 mmol) in MeOH (20 mL) was added 2.0 mL of TMSCH2N2 (1.0 M in hexane) dropwise over 5 min The yellow solution was stirred at room temperature for 40 h. The solvent was evaporated and the crude oil was purified by flash chromatography (hexanes:AcOEt=2:1, then hexanes:AcOEt=1:1) to afford 440 mg (95%) of the methylated compound (33b) as a yellow oil. To a suspension of compound 33b (400 mg, 0.79 mmol) and 5% Pd—C (150 mg) in methanol (30 mL) was added 3 drops of concentrated hydrogen chloride aqueous solution and the mixture was stirred under hydrogen atmosphere for 4 h. After the Pd—C catalyst was filtered off through a pad of Celite, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. 40 ml of dichloromethane was added and the suspension was basified with saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution and the organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to give the crude product, which was purified by column chromatography (CH2Cl2/CH3OH=50/1) to yield 238 mg of (+)-Govadine 53 (92%, >99% ee) as a light yellow solid.

Example 6 Receptor Binding Profile of d- and l-Govadine The affinity of d- and l-govadine for dopamine and serotonin receptors was performed by MDS Pharma Services, Inc (King of Prussia, Pa.). All receptors tested were heterologously expressed CHO cells and IC50 values were determined by a non-linear, least squares regression analysis using MathIQ (ID Business Solution Ltd, UK). Ki was calculated using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (1973, Biochem. Pharmacol 22:23099-3108) derived from the observed IC50 of the tested compound, the concentration of radioligand employed in the assay, and the historical values for the Kd of the ligand (obtained experimentally at MDS Pharma Services). The results of this experiment are shown in Table 2 and demonstrate that a different percentage of the two enantiomeric forms of govadine present different binding affinity to the D2 receptors. d-govadine presents strong binding affinity to the D1 receptor and weak affinity to the D2 receptor, whereas l-govadine presents strong affinity to both the D1 and D2 receptors.

Reference standards were run as an integral part of each assay to ensure the validity of the results obtained. Dopamine D1 receptors are generally known to couple only to Gs and increase cAMP production. The Dopamine D1 receptor Adenylyl Cyclase Cellular Assay for d- and l-govadine was performed by MDS Pharma Services, Inc (King of Prussia, Pa.). Dopamine D1 receptors were heterologously expressed CHO cells and test articles (d-govadine or l-govadine) were tested at concentrations that range from 10 mM to 1 nM. Basal levels of cAMP production were measured and compared to the levels of cAMP in response to d- and l-govadine treatment (incubation buffer HBSS, 5 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 100 μM IBMX, pH7.4, for 30 minutes at 37° C.). (+)-Butaclamol was used as a positive control for the assay assessing antagonism. Homogeneous fluorescence methodology HTRF homogeneous fluorescence quantitation methodology was used to measure the levels of cAMP. The criterion for significant agonist activity is ≧50% increase in cAMP relative to dopamine response. The criteria for significant antagonist activity ≧50% inhibition of dopamine-induced cAMP increase. The results of this experiment are shown in Table 3. A significant antagonistic response was noted for d-govadine with an IC50 of 2.38 mM and for l-govadine with an IC50 of 0.0166 mM. The data suggest that, although differing in efficacy, both d- and l-govadine are only weak dopamine D1 receptor antagonists and would not be expected to function as cognitive enhancers.

Locomotor activity was assessed on day 1 of habituation and treatment groups were assigned in a counter balanced fashion depending on locomotor activity on this day. Animals received IP injections of: 3.0 mg/kg d-govadine (N=8), 10.0 mg/kg d-govadine (N=6), 0.3 mg/kg l-govadine (N=6), 1.0 mg/kg l-govadine (N=6), 3.0 mg/kg l-govadine (N=6), 5.0 mg/kg clozapine (N=6), 10 mg/kg clozapine (N=6), 15 minutes before 1.5 mg/kg d-AMPH on day 5. After d-AMPH/SAL injection, distance travelled was assessed for 1 hr. Distance travelled was recorded with Noldus Ethovision XT (Noldus, Leesburg, Va.) and analyzed off-line. The results are shown in FIG. 2. A robust increase in locomotion was observed with a 1.5 mg/kg dose of d-AMPH (black bars). Pre-treatment with d-govadine (light gray bars) was without effect whereas pre-treatment with l-govadine (dark gray bars) robustly suppressed amphetamine-induced locomotion (AIL). Injection of clozapine (white bars) completely ameliorated AIL. All data are presented as the mean±SEM (*comparison with Saline+VEH, Tukey's post hoc, p<0.05; # comparison with d-AMPH+VEH, Tukey's post hoc, p<0.05). These data suggest that d-govadine is an unlikely candidate for effectively addressing the psychomotor abnormalities that characterize psychosis, whereas l-govadine would appear to address these pathologies and possess a pharmacological profile consistent with an antipsychotic. Example 9 Effect of d- and l-Govadine on Conditioned Avoidance Responding Conditioned avoidance responding (CAR) was performed in a two-way avoidance procedure with drug naive rats in four shuttle boxes (Med Associates, Vt., USA) each consisting of two compartments separated by an open door. Each compartment contained a wall-mounted speaker, house light and 5 photocells to detect the location of the animal. All experimental protocols and data acquisition were controlled by custom programs written in MED-PC. Before training, each animal received two acclimation sessions lasting 30 min with only the house light illuminated. On the training day, rats were placed in the box 15 min before the trial commenced for acclimation. Pairings of the conditioned stimulus (CS) (white noise, ˜60 dB) and the unconditioned stimulus (US) (footshock, 0.75 mA) were presented at random intervals with a mean of 60 sec. The CS was presented for 10 sec. During this time, if the animal moved to the opposite side of the box, the white noise was silenced, no foot shock delivered, and an avoidance response was scored. Upon termination of the 10 sec tone, if the animal had not moved to the opposite side of the box, a foot-shock was administered for 2 sec. Movement to the opposite compartment during this period resulted in termination of both the CS and US and an escape was scored. Failure to avoid or escape constituted a response failure and was scored accordingly. After reaching a criterion of 90% avoidances for a block of 20 trials, usually achieved with ˜100 CS-US pairings, each animal advanced to the drug-testing phase. Animals not meeting the criterion by 120 pairings were excluded from the study. On the subsequent drug-test day, animals were injected subcutaneously with either vehicle (N=8), 1.0 mg/kg d-govadine (N=6), 3.0 mg/kg d-govadine (N=6), 10.0 mg/kg d-govadine (N=6), 0.3 mg/kg l-govadine (N=6), 1.0 mg/kg l-govadine (N=7), 3.0 mg/kg l-govadine (N=6), or 5.0 mg/kg clozapine (N =8), then placed immediately into the 2 way-avoidance chamber with house lights illuminated. After 15 min of acclimation in the chamber, the CS-US pairings began. Pairings were presented just as during training and were scored in the same fashion. The test trial consisted of 100 CS-US pairings. The results are shown in FIG. 3. Suppression of conditioned avoidance responding was observed in l-govadine (dark gray bars) and clozapine (white bar) treated animals but not in d-govadine (light gray bars) treated animals. A decrease in avoidances was accompanied by an increase in escapes ruling out the possibility that this compound induced a motor impairment. (*comparison with VEH group, Tukey's post hoc, p<0.05). These data suggest that l-govadine can be used as an antipsychotic due to its D2 antagonistic activity whereas d-govadine would be much less effective as an antipsychotic. Example 10 Effect of d- and l-Govadine on Dopamine Levels in the Brain On surgery day, rats (275-300 g) were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane (AErrane, Baxter Co., Toronto, Canada) mixed with oxygen, and then maintained with 1.5-2.5% isoflurane for the remainder of the surgery. Rats received subcutaneous injections of an analgesic (ketoprofen 0.05 mL or buprenorphine, 0.1 mL) and sterile saline (0.9% NaCl, ˜3 mL). Once shaved and cleaned, the heads were secured in the stereotaxic frame in flat skull position for bilateral implantation of stainless steel microdialysis guide cannulae (19 gauge×15 mm) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (from bregma +1.7 mm anterior and ±1.1 mm medial; from dura −1.0 mm ventral) or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (+3.0 mm anterior, ±0.6 mm medial; −1.0 mm ventral). All coordinates were determined using the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (1997, The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates, Academic Press, London (ISBN 0 12 547623)). Rats were allowed to rest with heat support until they regained consciousness, and then given a one-week recovery period. Microdialysis probes were assembled 1-2 days prior to microdialysis experiments. Probes were concentric in design, constructed from Filtral 12 AN69HF semi-permeable hollow fibres (2 mm length, 340 μm OD×4 mm, 65 kDalton molecular weight cut-off; Hospal, Neurnberg, Germany) and silica inlet-outlet lines (75/150 um ID/OD). Typical in vitro probe recoveries of external standard solutions at room temperature (21° C.) were: 12% for dopamine (DA), 9% for 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 8% for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. The day prior to microdialysis experiments, probes were connected to an Instech dual-channel liquid swivel (Plymouth Meeting, Pa.) and flushed with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). The aCSF consisted of a 10.0 mM sodium phosphate buffer with 147.0 mM NaCl, 3.0 mM KCl, 1.0 mM MgCl2 and 1.2 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.4). Following DA recovery tests, probes were implanted via the guide cannulae (dialysis membrane spanned −4.8 to −6.8 mm ventrally for NAc; −1.6 to −3.6 mm for mPFC). Rats remained in the testing chamber overnight (14-16 hr) with aCSF perfusing continuously through the probes at 1 μL/min In the morning, microdialysis samples were collected at 10 min intervals and assayed for DA, DOPAC, homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-HIAA content. Once baseline levels were determined to be stable for four consecutive samples (less than 10% fluctuation), the drug treatment phase of each experiment was initiated. Microdialysis samples were analyzed immediately after collection using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. Two systems were used, each consisting of an ESA 582 pump (Bedford, Mass., USA), a pulse damper (Scientific Systems Inc., State College, Pa.), a Rheodyne Inert manual injector (model 9125i, 20 μL injection loop; Rohnert Park, Calif.), a Tosoh Bioscience Super ODS TSK column (2 μm particle, 2 mm×10 mm; Montgomeryville, Pa.) and an Antec Leyden Intro Electrochemical detector and VT-03 flow cell with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Vapplied=+650 mV; Leyden, The Netherlands). The mobile phase [70 mM sodium acetate buffer, 40 mg/L EDTA and 50 mg/L of sodium dodecyl sulfate (adjustable), pH 4.0, 10% methanol] flowed through the system at 0.17 mL/min EZChrome Elite software (Scientific Software, Pleasanton, Calif.) was used to acquire and analyze chromatographic data. The results are shown in FIG. 4 (l-govadine treated animals) and FIG. 5 (d-govadine treated animals). Injection with l-govadine increased dopamine levels in both the PFC and the NAc (FIG. 4: panel A). An increase in both dopamine metabolites, DOPAC and HVA, in the PFC and NAc was also observed (FIG. 4: panels B and C). No increase in the serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, was observed (FIG. 4: panel D). In contrast, injection with d-govadine selectively increased dopamine in the PFC but not in the NAc (FIG. 5: panel A). d-govadine also increased both dopamine metabolites, DOPAC and HVA, in the PFC, with no increase observed in the NAc (FIG. 5: panels B and C). In addition, d-govadine increased the serotinin metabolite, 5-HIAA, in the PFC but not the NAc (FIG. 5: panel D). The results thus demonstrated the differential function of l- and d-govadine in inducing dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. Example 11 Effect of d- and l-Govadine on Temporal Order Recognition The task exploits a rat's natural preference for novel locations. Each animal received 3 separate trials where access to two arms of an eight arm radial arm maze was granted. During the first trial, two arms were selected at random for exploration, and animals were allowed to explore these arms for 2 min After this time, they were taken off the maze and returned to their home cage. 1 hour later they were placed back on the maze and two new arms were randomly selected for 2 min of exploration. At the conclusion of this 2 min, animals were again returned to their home cage for either a 45 min or 4 hr delay. Animals were injected 15 min before the start of the third “test” trail (45 min delay: 1.0 mg/kg d-govadine (N=7), 1.0 mg/kg l-govadine (N=6), 5.0 mg/kg clozapine (CLZ) (N=8), vehicle (VEH) (N=7); 4 hour delay: 1.0 mg/kg d-govadine (N=6), 1.0 mg/kg l-govadine (N=8), 5.0 mg/kg CLZ (N=6), VEH (N=6) At the completion of the delay, one arm from the first trial and one arm from the second trial was opened and the animal was placed on the maze and allowed to freely explore. Time spent in each arm (recent and old) was recorded as well as total distance traveled and the total number of arm entries in Noldus EthoVision 3.1 (Leesburg, Va.). Temporal order recognition is expressed as an increase in the time spent “old” arm relative to the “new” (Hannessan et al., 2004, J Neurosci., 24(19):4596-604; Hotte et al., 2005, Neurobiol Learn Mem. 84(2):85-92). The results are shown in FIG. 6 (**recent vs old comparison, Tukey's post hoc, p<0.01). At the 45 min delay, a robust temporal order effect was observed in VEH treated animals and was abolished by 1.0 mg/kg d-govadine, 1.0 mg/kg l-govadine, and 5.0 mg/kg CLZ (FIG. 6A). At the 4 hr delay, no temporal order effect was observed in VEH treated animals, as well as l-govadine and CLZ treated animals (FIG. 6B). However, treatment with d-govadine restored temporal order recognition at the 4 hr delay. The nature of the l-govadine and CLZ-evoked temporal order deficit was different than the d-govadine mediated deficit, as the locomotor profiles of these animals were very different (see Table 4). VEH and d-govadine treated animals made more arm entries and moved further than l-govadine or CLZ treated animals. It is likely that the motor suppression observed in the l-govadine and CLZ groups was meditated by the D2 antagonism of these compounds.

Example 12 Psychopharmacological Assessment of dl-Govadine Animals: All experiments were performed with male Long-Evans rats (Charles River, Saint Constant, Quebec) weighing 250-400 grams. All animals were maintained on a reverse light cycle with the dark cycle beginning at 8 am and ending at 8 pm. Animals were pair housed, except in the delayed win shift experiments where they were single housed in order to control feeding and maintain rats at 85% free-feeding weight. All protocols were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee and conducted in accordance with policies outlined by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Drug Preparation: In each experiment, dl-govadine was used as a racemic mixture containing 50% of each the d- and l-isomer. dl-govadine was dissolved in isotonic saline solution with 30% dimethylformamide (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo.) and 1% Acetic Acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo.). Mass spectrometry confirmed these solvents did not alter dl-govadine. Clozapine (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo.) was dissolved in saline containing 1% acetic acid. d-AMPH (US Pharmacopeia, Rockville, Md.) was dissolved in isotonic 0.9% saline. Pharmacology: The affinity of dl-govadine for dopamine (DA), serotonin, and noradrenaline receptors was assessed by MDS Pharma Services, Inc (King of Prussia, Pa.). All receptors were heterologously expressed CHO cells and IC50 values were determined by a non-linear, least squares regression analysis using MathIQ (ID Business Solution Ltd, UK). K1 was calculated (Y. Cheng & Prusoff 1973) from the observed IC50 of the tested compound, the concentration of radioligand employed in the assay, and the historical values for the Kd of the ligand (obtained experimentally at MDS Pharma Services). Behavioral Assays Catalepsy: In order to assess the cataleptic effect of dl-govadine, a dose-response curve was established in naïve animals. Testing occurred in a plexiglas box (28 cm×45 cm×20 cm) containing a horizontal steel bar located 8 cm above floor level. Each animal was allowed 1 hr acclimation to the box prior to testing and then injected subcutaneously (SC) with either vehicle (N=8), or dl-govadine 6 mg/kg (N=5), 3 mg/kg (N=5), 1.5 mg/kg (N=5), or 1.0 mg/kg (N=6). After injection animals were returned to the test box and catalepsy testing occurred at 1, 15, 30, and 45 minutes after injection. Testing at each time point lasted 2 min after the forepaws of each rat was placed on the bar. Behavior was recorded with a video camera (Cohu, Poway, Calif.) and scored off-line. The cumulative time spent immobilized with both forelimbs on the horizontal bar was scored for each 2 min test epoch. Videos selected at random were scored independently by a second observer and a high inter-rater reliability was observed (R2=0.93, F=393.4, p<0.05). The ED50 was calculated from the number of animals that exhibited 60 sec of contact time across each dose at the 45 min time point. Amphetamine induced locomotion (AIL): Animals were habituated to locomotor arenas for 1 hr on 4 consecutive days prior to testing. Locomotor activity was assessed on day 1 of habituation and treatment groups were assigned in a counter-balanced manner determined by distance traveled on day 1. Animals received intraperitoneal (IP) injections of dl-govadine at 0.3 mg/kg (N=7), 1.0 mg/kg (N=6), 3.0 mg/kg (N=6), or vehicle (VEH) (N=7) 15 minutes before d-AMPH on day 5. dl-govadine/VEH was injected 15 minutes before 1.5 mg/kg d-AMPH or SAL and distance traveled was assessed for 1 hr post d-AMPH/SAL injection. A separate group of animals received dl-govadine (N=8) or VEH (N=7) on days 3 and 4 previous to d-AMPH testing on day 5 to assess if previous experience with dl-govadine to suppressed AIL. Distance traveled was recorded with Noldus Ethovision XT (Noldus, Leesburg, Va.) and analyzed off-line. The ED50 was calculated as the dose necessary to inhibit d-AMPH induced locomotion by 50% over 1 hr in animals which received VEH. Conditioned avoidance responding: Conditioned avoidance responding (CAR) was assessed as described in Example 10. On the drug test day, animals were injected SC with either vehicle (N=8), or dl-govadine (0.3 mg/kg, N=7; 1.0 mg/kg, N=8; 3.0 mg/kg, N=7) then placed in the avoidance box with house lights illuminated. After 15 min, the presentation of the 100 CS-US pairings began and were scored as during training. Sensitization: Animals were removed from the colony and taken to a holding room where they received either IP d-AMPH or saline every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Doses started at 1 mg/kg and increased 1 mg/kg each week over 5 weeks to 5 mg/kg. 25 days after the induction phase, behavioral sensitization was assessed over 3 days in locomotor chambers (plexiglass box, 40 cm×40 cm×40 cm) where speed and distance traveled were recorded using Noldus Ethovision XT (Noldus, Leesburg, Va.). The first day consisted of a 2 hr acclimation session, and prior to counter balanced injections of either 0.5 mg/kg d-AMPH or saline on days 2 and 3 animals were acclimated for 1 hr. Experiments were run in two separate cohorts of 30 animals to minimize the time between testing sensitization and LI. Latent Inhibition: LI tests were performed in rats treated with 1.0 mg/kg acute d-AMPH, sensitized rats, and drug-naive rats. LI testing began 5 days post-challenge of the escalating dose regime. Animals in both conditions (chronic saline or sensitized) were randomly assigned to either non-pre-exposed (NPE) or pre-exposed (PE) groups. Testing took place over 3 consecutive days. Sensitized or saline animals were randomly assigned to VEH or 1.0 mg/kg dl-govadine groups and received SC injections 15 min before each pre-exposure trial. Animals in the PE group received 50 presentations of the CS (10 sec duration) per day at a variable interval for the first two days. Animals in the NPE group were placed in the chamber for an equal time as the PE animals. Conditioning (COND) consisted of 100 CS-US pairings. Latency to cross into the other compartment and the number of total beam breaks were recorded. Drug-naïve animals receiving acute 1.0 mg/kg AMPH were injected IP 45 min before the COND trial. Delayed Spatial Win-Shift Task: The delayed spatial win-shift was performed in sensitized and drug-naive animals. Briefly, the delayed spatial win-shift (DSWSh) procedure consisted of 3 phases; training, delay, and test. During the training phase animals were placed on the maze with four of eight arms open. After the fourth food pellet (Noyes, Lancaster, N.H.) was consumed, the animal was confined to the last arm visited for the delay period with the light extinguished. After the delay, the light was turned on, all 8 arms opened, and food was available only in the 4 arms blocked during the training phase. Re-entry into an arm constituted an error and a criterion of 1 error or less for 2 consecutive days was required to advance to the next delay or the test day. Animals were trained to criterion at a 1, 5, and 30 min delay. When an animal reached criterion at the 30 min delay, it was then assigned to the 30 min or 12 hr delay test group. Prior to each test, rats received counter-balanced SC injections of either VEH or 1.0 mg/kg dl-govadine 30 min before the test phase. After the first test trial, criterion performance was re-established and the second counter-balanced injection was delivered. Microdialysis: Microdialysis experiments were conducted as described in Example 11. Drug treatment phase was initiated with a 1.0 mg/kg SC injection of dl-govadine or VEH. After the experiments, rats were deeply anesthetized, brains were removed and stored in 20% w/v sucrose and 4% v/v paraformaldehyde. Brains were sliced into 50 um coronal sections, stained with cresyl violet and examined for probe placement. Data Analysis: Data were imported into Matlab (Mathworks, Nantick, Mass.) or R (see r-project website) for statistical analysis. Each data set was subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing. ANOVA testing of DSWSh data employed a between/within design: treatment was as a within subjects measurement as every animal received a test day with either VEH or dl-govadine; delay (30 min, 12 hour) and background (saline, sensitized) were treated as between subjects variables as each animal was only received one of these. Microdialysis data was assessed via two-way ANOVA and treatment (dl-govadine, VEH) was an independent variable, and time was a within subjects repeated variable. When appropriate, Tukey's post-hoc testing was applied for multiple comparisons with an alpha=0.05. A general linear model using a probit kernel was applied to the data to determine the ED50 of dl-govadine on catalepsy, CAR, and AIL. Results dl-Govadine Exhibits a High Affinity for Dopamine Receptors dl-govadine exhibited high affinity for DA receptors, moderate affinity for noradrenaline receptors, and relatively weak affinity for serotonin receptors (Table 5). Higher affinity for D1 receptors compared to D2 was observed for dl-govadine which is reflected as a low D1/D2 ratio (Table 6).

Basal DA levels were detected as 0.18+/−0.03 and 0.17+/−0.02 nM in the PFC; 1.59+/−0.20 nM and 1.97±0.34 nM in the NAc for VEH and dl-govadine treated animals, respectively. A single injection of 1.0 mg/kg SC dl-GOV increased DA in both the PFC (two-way ANOVA, main effect of treatment, F(1,300)=9.07, p=0.0028) and NAc (two-way ANOVA, main effect of treatment F(1,243)=18.64, p<0.0001) relative to VEH injection. In the PFC, DA levels peaked during the first 10 min after injection where as the NAc peak was observed 20-30 min post injection (FIG. 7 A1, B1). Increases in both DA metabolites were observed in the PFC (DOPAC, two-way ANOVA, main effect of treatment, F(1,300)=6.01, p=0.0148; HVA, two-way ANOVA, main effect of treatment, F(1,300)=5.34, p=0.0215) and the NAc (DOPAC, two-way ANOVA, main effect of treatment, F(1,243)=16.92, p=0.001; HVA, two-way ANOVA, treatment×time interaction, F(1,243)=18.48, p<0.0001). A transient increase in DA was also observed in the PFC in response to VEH injection which was not observed in the NAc (FIG. 7 Al). No increase in the serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, was observed in either brain region (FIG. 7 A4, B4). Catalepsy is Observed with High Doses of dl-Govadine A dose-dependent increase (R2=0.91, F=28.41, p<0.05) in immobilized contact time was observed with increasing doses of dl-govadine. Strong and extended catalepsy was observed at the 6.0 mg/kg dose while mild motor suppression was observed at 1.0 mg/kg without any sign of overt catalepsy. Furthermore, this dose did not induce a spike in cataleptic-like behavior at 15 min post-injection, unlike the 1.5 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg doses (multiple comparison, p<0.05). The ED50 value calculated at 45 min from the four doses of dl-govadine used yielded a value of 4.7 mg/kg, which is comparable to the value of 3.6 mg/kg observed for 1-SPD (see Table 6). dl-Govadine Impairs Conditioned Avoidance Responding dl-govadine dose-dependently suppressed avoidances (R2=−0.5, F=29.02 p<0.0001) in animals proficient with CAR. Decreased avoidance behavior was accompanied by an increase in escapes in dl-govadine and CLZ treated animals (dose×measure interaction F(4,75)=16.56 p<0.001), providing strong evidence that the disruption of avoidance behavior was not due to motor impairment. The ED50 value calculated at 20 min post-injection from the three doses of dl-govadine used yielded a value of 0.723 mg/kg, which is higher than the value of 0.27 mg/kg for 1-SPD, obtained at the same time point post-treatment (see Table 6). dl-Govadine Dose Dependently Inhibits d-Amphetamine Induced Locomotion 1.5 mg/kg IP d-AMPH increased locomotor activity relative to saline injection, and was dose-dependently suppressed (R2=−0.4, F=18.87, p=0.00022) with increasing doses of dl-govadine prior to d-AMPH. An ED50 of 1.7 mg/kg was calculated for dl-govadine mediated suppression of AIL (see Table 6). dl-Govadine Treatment at Pre-Exposure Reverses the Bidirectional Effects of Sensitization and Acute d-Amphetamine on Latent Inhibition Injections of VEH or dl-govadine immediately before each pre-exposure session had no subsequent effect on LI in non-sensitized animals as both treatments produced an indistinguishable number of avoidances in pre-exposed animals (FIG. 8A). Acute d-AMPH has been repeatedly shown to abolish LI, and this effect was replicated in the current study (FIG. 8B, left). Remarkably, administration of dl-govadine prior to each pre-exposure session ameliorated this effect and restored LI in acute d-AMPH-treated animals (FIG. 8B, middle). To address the possibility that pretreatment with dl-govadine blunts the motor-stimulant effect of d-AMPH, thereby mediating the decreased number of avoidances observed, a separate group of animals were pretreated with either dl-govadine or VEH on two consecutive days and placed in an open field. On the third day animals were injected with 1.5 mg/kg d-AMPH and placed back in the open field where speed and distance traveled were recorded. No effect of dl-govadine pretreatment was observed on this measure of AIL (d-AMPH+prior dl-govadine, 12,798±1,504 versus d-AMPH+prior VEH, 12,158±1971 (mean±SEM); Student's t-test, p>0.05), suggesting that dl-govadine pretreatment did not suppress the motor-stimulant effect of d-AMPH but rather suppressed the ability of d-AMPH to facilitate the association between the CS and the US. We next assessed if pretreatment with 5.0 mg/kg SC clozapine (CLZ) restored LI in the same manner as dl-govadine. We observed that CLZ pretreatment decreased the number of avoidances in PE animals, however, NPE animals also showed a similar decrease in the number of avoidances relative to other NPE animals (FIG. 8B, right). No statistical difference (p>0.05) was found between NPE or PE animals receiving CLZ indicating a lack of LI, thus CLZ pre-treatment does not offset acute d-AMPH induced deficits in LI in the same manner as dl-govadine. Finally, the consequences of the 5-week escalating dose d-AMPH sensitization regime on the expression of LI were explored (FIG. 8C). Sensitization was confirmed in animals receiving repeated d-AMPH as an increase locomotion to 0.5 mg/kg IP d-AMPH challenge relative to those who received repeated saline (saline 178±16% versus sensitized, 247±22% (mean±SEM); students t-test, p<0.05). The 5-week increasing-dose regime of d-AMPH had the unanticipated effect of significantly decreasing the number of avoidances in the PE group, indicative of increased in LI (FIG. 8C, left). Sensitized PE animals pretreated with dl-govadine exhibited the same number of avoidances observed in non-sensitized PE animals (FIG. 8C, right) showing that dl-govadine restored LI to levels observed in controls (FIG. 8A). It is noteworthy that in each of the groups tested, an inverse relationship was observed between avoidances and escapes (exposure×measure interaction, F(1,189)=28.4, p<0.001), indicating intact motor performance in rats treated with either dl-govadine or CLZ. dl-Govadine Improves Cognitive Performance on the Delayed Spatial Win-Shift Task A significant main effect of treatment (three-way ANOVA, main effect of treatment, F(1,48)=4.40, p<0.041) was observed in this experiment, confirming that dl-govadine improved the ability of rodents to use a memory-based foraging strategy. In large part, this effect was attributable to a significant increase in errors at the 12 hr delay in non-sensitized animals that was blocked by treatment with dl-govadine 30 min prior to the test phase (FIG. 9, left). However, dl-govadine had no effect at the 30 min delay in non-sensitized animals. In the current study, sensitized animals make significantly fewer errors at a 12 hr delay (three-way ANOVA, background×delay interaction, F(1,48)=4.74, p<0.05, FIG. 6, right) than their non-sensitized counterparts indicating that sensitization may have improved working memory performance. Furthermore, a tendency for increased errors at 30 min in sensitized animals was observed which was suppressed by dl-govadine (three-way ANOVA, treatment×background×delay interaction, F(1,48)=3.11, p<0.08, FIG. 9). Taken together, these data reveal the complex nature of sensitization-evoked perturbations on working memory and establish the ability of dl-govadine to improve performance of this complex cognitive task. The study presented in this Example demonstrates that dl-govadine at a dose of 6 mg/kg induced strong catalepsy, whereas only transient bouts of inactivity were observed briefly with the lower doses tested. These lower, non-cataleptic doses were therefore selected for all subsequent experiments. Importantly, non-cataleptic doses of dl-govadine suppressed AIL, consistent with an ability to mitigate behavioral abnormalities arising from hyperdopaminergia, including the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, dl-govadine at doses of 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg suppressed avoidance behavior without affecting escape responses. The efficacy of dl-govadine on measures of catalepsy and antipsychotic efficacy was comparable to 1-SPD evidenced by their similar ED50 values (Table 4). When compared with CLZ, both dl-GOV and 1-SPD exhibited a lower ED50 to suppress AIL and CAR, indicating that both these compounds may provide an effective treatment option for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. This study also demonstrated that systemic administration of CLZ or dl-govadine during CS pre-exposure blocked the increase in avoidance responses normally produced by acute d-AMPH in animals pre-exposed to the CS. Importantly, CLZ also disrupted avoidance behavior in NPE rats given acute d-AMPH, suggesting a more general effect on the formation of a CS-US association, but this general impairment was not observed with dl-govadine treatment indicating that dl-govadine may more selectively target the compromised attentional processes which disrupt LI than CLZ. These data thus establish that dl-govadine exhibits a different profile than clozapine on this measure and may more effectively target cognitive pathologies than this currently approved antipsychotic. Together, these data indicate that dl-govadine may have the unique ability to influence both positive and negative symptom poles of schizophrenia. Example 13 Effect of d- and l-Govadine on Catalepsy and Latent Inhibition Catalepsy testing was conducted as described in Example 12. After the 1 hr acclimation to the box, rats were injected subcutaneously (SC) with either vehicle (N=6), 0.3 mg/kg l-govadine (L-GOV) (N=6), 1.0 mg/kg L-GOV (N=6), 3.0 mg/kg L-GOV (N=6), 3.0 mg/kg d-govadine (D-GOV) (N=6), or 6.0 mg/kg D-GOV (N=5). The results are shown in FIG. 10. Catalepsy was observed in L-GOV treated animals, but not D-GOV treated animals (dose X time interaction, two-way ANOVA F(20,149)=10.64, p<0.0001). Cataleptic behavior peaked in L-GOV treated animals 15 min post injection (FIG. 10A). An increase in the total amount of immobilized contact time summed across each time point was observed with each dose of L-GOV relative to vehicle (VEH) and D-GOV (FIG. 10B). No evidence of catalepsy was observed in D-GOV treated animals. The effects of the two individual enantiomers of govadine on latent inhibition (LI) were also tested as described in Example 12. The results indicated that, similar to the racemic compound, treatment with either D- or L-GOV during pre-exposure restored LI in animals given d-AMPH prior to conditioning (see FIG. 10C). Example 14 Effect of d- and l-Govadine on Social Interaction Prior to social interaction testing all animals (experimental and partner) were separately acclimated to the social interaction environment for 10 min on 2 consecutive days. Experimental rats were neonatal ventral hippocampal lesioned (NVHL) and control (Sham) animals. All partner rats were handled daily for 10 minutes one week prior to SI testing. The SI environment consisted of a 83×90×30 cm open field with each surface painted black. On the day of social interaction testing, experimental rats were injected IP with either VEH (Sham, N=17; NVHL, N=15), 1.0 mg/kg l-govadine (L-GOV) (Sham, N=18; NVHL, N=13), or 1.0 mg/kg d-govadine (D-GOV) (Sham, N=17; NVHL, N=15) 15 minutes prior to SI testing. For testing, partner rats were placed in the environment first and then experimental animals (Sham or NVHL) were introduced for 10 minutes. Partner and experimental rats were matched for weight, size, and age. Behavior was recorded by a camera mounted over the environment and scored offline. The time spent interacting between the two animals was scored as described in Sams-Dodd, F., 1999, Review in Neurosciences, 10:59-90. Vehicle treated NVHL rats exhibited a robust decrease in social interaction time. However, for both D-GOV or L-GOV treated animals, comparable levels of SI were observed in NVHL rats and Sham controls. Example 15 Effect of d- and l-Govadine on Dopamine Neurons In this Example, the ability of individual isomers to reverse the D2 receptor-mediated decreases in firing of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons was investigated. DA efflux in both the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was also measured in vivo using microdialysis and HPLC-ED. Horizontal midbrain slices (220 μm) were prepared from male Sprague Dawley rats (3-4 weeks old). Cell-attached voltage-clamp recordings were used to examine tonic firing rate of DA neurons at 31-32° C. using patch pipette and bathing solutions consisting of physiological saline. Putative DA neurons were identified by spontaneous pacemaker firing (1-3 Hz) with broad APs (≧2.0 ms). Identified cells not responsive to Quinpirole (500 nM), a D2 DA receptor agonist, were excluded from further recording. Cells were also filled with biocytin or Alexa for posthoc-identification using TH immunostaining. Microdialysis probes (2 mm active membrane) were implanted in the NAc and mPFC ˜16 hrs prior to start of the experiment and continuously perfused aCSF. Dialysates were collected at 10 min intervals and assayed for DA content by HPLC-EC. l- or d-govadine (1 mg/kg) was administered once stable DA levels were established. The results are shown in FIG. 11. Neither l-govadine (FIGS. 11A,B) nor d-govadine (FIGS. 11 C,D) alone had an effect on the spontaneous firing activity of midbrain DA neurons. Consistent with previous findings, Quinpirole stimulated D2 autoreceptors thereby decreasing the tonic firing activity through GIRK activation. Co-application of l-govadine, but not d-govadine, during the peak inhibitory effect of Quinpirole antagonized the D2 autoreceptor-mediated decreases in tonic firing of DA neurons. The microdialysis experiments confirmed enhanced DA efflux in NAc and mPFC following injections of l-govadine and dl-govadine, but not d-govadine, when compared to control (FIG. 11E). This effect was dose-dependent (100 nM to 10 μM). The data shown in FIG. 11 indicate that d- and l-govadine have differential effects. Specifically, l-govadine, but not d-govadine, can antagonize D2 receptors in midbrain DA neurons in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that l-govadine, and not d-govadine, possesses antipsychotic activity. The effects of l-govadine are likely mediated by direct blockade of D2 autoreceptors or possibly inhibition of intracellular signalling including G protein binding. Example 16 Effect of d- and l-Govadine on Conditioned Avoidance Responding #2 The effect of d- and l-govadine in the conditioned avoidance responding (CAR) test was investigated as described in Example 9, but using dosages of 1.0 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg d-govadine and 0.5 mg/kg and 0.75 mg/kg of l-govadine. The results are shown in FIG. 12 and confirm that l-govadine, but not d-govadine, suppresses CAR. Example 17 Effect of d-Govadine on Delayed Spatial Win-Shift The effect of d-govadine was investigated in a prospective coding version of the delayed spatial win-shift experiment. Animals received 6 training phase arms that biases the use of prospective foraging strategy (see Seamans, J. K., et al., 1998, J. Neuroscience, 18(4):1613-1621; Cook, R. G., et al., 1985, Animal Behavior Processes, 11:453-469). Each rat received an injection of 1.0 mg/kg d-govadine (D-GOV) or vehicle (VEH) 15 minutes prior to the training phase and a 15 min delay was employed between the training and test phase. The rat must visit the remaining two arms in the test phase to complete the task. The results are shown in FIG. 15 and demonstrate that d-Govadine dramatically improved this strictly PFC-dependent foraging strategy (*Paired T-test, p=0.0082, (n=7)). This data indicates that d-govadine improves prospective memory. Example 18 Comparison of Effect of d,l-Govadine, Olanzapine and Clozapine on Conditioned Avoidance Responding The effects of repeated treatment with dl-govadine, olanzapine and clozapine in the conditioned avoidance responding (CAR) test were investigated as described in Example 9, using the following dosages: dl-Govadine: 0.3 mg/kg (N=6) or 1.0 mg/kg (N=8) Olanzapine: 0.5 mg/kg (N=6) or 1.0 mg/kg (N=8) Clozapine: 2.5 mg/kg (N=6) or 5.0 mg/kg (N=10) The results are shown in FIG. 14. A rapid development of tolerance was observed with clozapine at 5 mg/kg and sensitization with the low dose of olanzapine. Neither of these effects was observed with dl-govadine.
