In the Chemical Formula 1, two of X's are N and two of X's are C, R1 to R4 are independently hydrogen, deuterium, a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C10 alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C12 aryl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C3 to C12 heterocycle, or a combination thereof, R5 to R12 are independently hydrogen, deuterium, a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C10 alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C12 aryl group, or a combination thereof, R13 to R22 are independently hydrogen, deuterium, a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C10 alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C12 aryl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C3 to C12 heterocycle, or a combination thereof, R13 to R22 are independently present or adjacent two are linked to each other to form a fused ring, L1 to L6 are independently a single bond, a substituted or unsubstituted phenylene group, a substituted or unsubstituted biphenylene group, a substituted or unsubstituted terphenylene group or a substituted or unsubstituted quaterphenylene group, n1 to n4 are independently integers ranging from 0 to 5, and the sum of n1 to n4 is an integer of 2 or more, preferably 6 or less The organic compound represented by the Chemical Formula 1 includes a substituted or unsubstituted benzoquinazoline including two nitrogens and at least two meta-bonded substituted or unsubstituted phenylene groups. The nitrogen moiety of the substituted or unsubstituted benzoquinazoline has polarity and thus, may interact with an electrode and accordingly, inject a charge easily and increase charge mobility by three fused rings. Furthermore, the substituted or unsubstituted benzoquinazoline has a relatively low LUMO energy level and thus, may easily inject electrons and improve thermal stability and electrical stability. The substituted or unsubstituted benzoquinazoline may have, for example, a LUMO energy level ranging from about 1.7 to about 2.1 eV. The at least two meta-bonded substituted or unsubstituted phenylene groups may control a charge stream flowing toward the benzoquinazoline and thus, increase stability of the benzoquinazoline. In particular, the at least two meta-bonded substituted or unsubstituted phenylene groups may decrease oxidation of cyclic carbons neighboring a nitrogen-containing cycle of the benzoquinazoline, that is, carbons bonded with R3 or R4 and thus, increase stability of the organic compound. Accordingly, life-span of the organic compound may be improved. For example, the R3 or R4 may be independently hydrogen. The at least two meta-bonded substituted or unsubstituted phenylene groups may be positioned at one side or both sides of the benzoquinazoline. For example, the at least two meta-bonded substituted or unsubstituted phenylene groups may be positioned at both sides of the benzoquinazoline, for example, n1 and n2 of the above Chemical Formula 1 may be independently 1 to 5.

The organic compound may have, for example, a molecular weight of greater than or equal to about 500. The organic compound has the molecular weight and thus, may show an increased glass transition temperature (Tg) and thus, increased stability but may be suppressed from degradation during the manufacuturing process when applied to a device. The glass transition temperature (Tg) may be related to thermal stability of an organic compound and a device manufactured by applying the same. In other words, when an organic compound having a high glass transition temperature (Tg) is applied as a thin film to an organic light emitting diode, the organic compound and the organic light emitting diode using the compound are prevented from degradation of by a temperature in a subsequent process, for example, an encapsulation process after deposition of the organic compound, securing life-span characteristics of the organic compound and the organic light emitting diode. The organic compound may have a glass transition temperature (Tg) of for example greater than or equal to about 70° C and effectively, greater than or equal to about 90° C within the range. The glass transition temperature (Tg) may be for example in a range of about 70° C or more to about 150° C or less and specifically about 90° C or more to about 130° C or less within the range.

A 1500 Å-thick ITO was used as an anode, and a 1000 Å-thick aluminum (Al) was used as a cathode. Specifically, an organic light emitting diode was manufactured by manufacturing the anode by cutting an ITO glass substrate having 15 Ω/cm2 of sheet resistance into a size of 50 mm ×50 mm × 0.7 mm and cleaning with a ultrasonic wave in acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and pure water respectively for 15 minutes and with UV ozone for 30 minutes. On the upper side of a substrate, a 600 Å-thick hole injection layer (HIL) was formed by vacuum-depositing 4,4' -bis[N-[4-{N,N-bis (3-methylphenyl)amino}-phenyl]-N-phenylamino]biphenyl [DNTPD] under a vacuum degree of 650 × 10-7 Pa at a deposition rate ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 nm/s.

Then, a 300 Å-thick emission layer was formed by vacuum-depositing the compound 1 of Synthesis Example 21 under the same vacuum deposition condition, and a phosphorescent dopant, acetylacetonatobis (2-phenylquinolinato)iridium (Ir(pq)2acac) was simultaneously deposited. Herein, 7 wt% of the phosphorescent dopant was deposited by adjusting a deposition rate of the phosphorescent dopant based on 100 wt% of the total amount of the emission layer. On the emission layer, a 50 Å-thick hole blocking layer was formed by depositing bis (2-methyl-8-quinolinolate)-4-(phenylphenolato)aluminium (BAlq) under the same vacuum deposition condition. Subsequently, a 250 Å-thick electron transport layer (ETL) was formed by depositing tris (8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminium (Alq3) under the same vacuum deposition condition. LiF and Al were sequentially deposited to form a cathode on the electron transport layer (ETL), manufacturing an organic light emitting diode. The organic light emitting diode has a structure of ITO/DNTPD 60nm/HT-1 30 nm/EML (a compound 1 (93 wt%) + Ir(pq)2acac (7 wt%), 30nm)/Balq (5 nm)/Alq3 25 nm/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm).

Elemental Analysis: C, 88 %; H, 5 % Manufacture of Organic Light Emitting Diode Using Second Host Example 8 A 1500 Å-thick ITO was used as an anode, and a 1000 Å-thick aluminum (Al) was used as a cathode. Specifically, an organic light emitting diode was manufactured by manufacturing the anode by cutting an ITO glass substrate having 15 Ω/cm2 of sheet resistance into a size of 50 mm ×50 mm × 0.7 mm and cleaning with a ultrasonic wave in acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and pure water respectively for 15 minutes and with UV ozone for 30 minutes. On the upper side of a substrate, a 600 Å-thick hole injection layer (HIL) was formed by vacuum-depositing 4,4'-bis[N-[4-{N,N-bis(3-methylphenyl)amino}-phenyl]-N-phenylamino]biphenyl [DNTPD] under a vacuum degree of 650 × 10-7 Pa at a deposition rate ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 nm/s. Subsequently, a 300 Å-thick hole transport layer (HTL) was formed by vacuum-depositing HT-1 under the same vacuum deposition condition. Then, a 300 Å-thick emission layer was formed by vacuum-depositing the compound 1 of Synthesis Example 21 and a second host, the compound C-10 obtained in Synthesis Example 5 under the same vacuum deposition condition. The compound 1 and the compound C-10 were used in a weight ratio of 4:1. When depositing the hosts, a phosphorescent dopant, acetylacetonatobis(2-phenylquinolinato)iridium (Ir(pq)2acac) was simultaneously deposited. Herein, 7 wt% of the phosphorescent dopant was deposited by adjusting a deposition rate of the phosphorescent dopant based on 100 wt% of the total amount of the emission layer. On the emission layer, a 50 Å-thick hole blocking layer was formed by depositing bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinolate)-4-(phenylphenolato)aluminium (BAIq) under the same vacuum deposition condition. Subsequently, a 250 Å-thick electron transport layer (ETL) was formed by depositing tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminium (Alq3) under the same vacuum deposition condition. LiF and Al were sequentially deposited to form a cathode on the electron transport layer (ETL), manufacturing an organic light emitting diode. The organic light emitting diode has a structure of ITO/ DNTPD (60 nm)/ HT-1 (30 nm)/ EML (compoundl: C-10=4:1, 93 wt%) + Ir(pq)2acac (7 wt%), 30 nm)/ Balq (5 nm)/ Alq3 (25 nm)/ LiF (1 nm) / Al (100 nm).
