2. Synthesis of Methyl 3-hyroxy-6-(ethyl-d5)-7-keto-5-cholan-24-oate (compound 8)
3-tetrahydropyranyloxy-6-(ethyl-d5)-7-keto-5-cholan-24-oic acid obtained in the previous step was dissolved in HCl solution in methanol (2N, 30 ml) and stirred under reflux for 16 h. After the volatiles were removed by concentration under vacuum, the residue was extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic fraction was washed subsequently with water, sat. NaHCO3 solution and brine, dried with Na2SO4 and concentrated, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (20-40% EtOAc/hexane) to afford a solid (0.6 g, yield 18%).
