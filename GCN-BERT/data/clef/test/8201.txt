TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a preservation treatment apparatus which can hold materials containing oxide (biomaterials including animals and plants, fresh foods and processed foods, and liquids including beverages and seasoning liquids) in a state where the materials can be preserved (a constant-temperature state, a freezing state or a refrigerating state) for a long time or for a long period. BACKGROUND ART With respect to a food preservation apparatus provided with high-voltage electric field forming electrodes, conventionally, there has been disclosed a food preservation apparatus which includes a current limiting mechanism in a high voltage power source, a DC current is used as a DC power source, and an AC current is superimposed on the DC current (patent document 1). This apparatus aims at a preservation effect generated by electric field treatment. It is considered that by providing the apparatus where a food support shelf in a freezer or a refrigerator is used as a high-voltage electric field forming electrode, and a high voltage electric field is applied to foods during preservation, foods and the like can be preserved for a long period or an action of improving tastes of foods and the like is generated. Conventionally, as inventions relating to a positive electric field treatment method, a positive electric field treatment apparatus and electrodes used in these method and apparatus, there has been disclosed the invention where foods and the like are placed on a shelf in a preservation storage, and electricity is applied to a charge plate (patent document 2). PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS PATENT DOCUMENTS Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 62-297677 Patent Document 2: PCT International Publication WO98/41115A1 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION However, in the above-mentioned conventional preservation apparatus, a preservation effect is given only by an electromagnetic field generated using the shelf on which foods are placed as a terminal. Accordingly, an effect generated by charges is not sufficient and hence, there may be a case where a preservation effect is poor. Further, in the conventional preservation apparatus, only a terminal at one pole is connected to the shelf and charges are applied only from the terminal and hence, the flow of an electric current on the shelf cannot be controlled thus giving rise to a drawback that the holding of a potential of a shelf portion becomes unstable. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a preservation treatment apparatus which can sufficiently apply an effect generated by charges to an object to be preserved thus more surely exhibiting a preservation effect generated by charges, and can stably hold an effect generated by a potential applied to the object to be preserved by controlling the flow of an electric current in a portion on which the object is stacked.

DESCRIPTION OF REFERENCE SIGNS Hereinafter, the present invention is described by reference to respective drawings which show embodiments of the present invention. In all embodiments, a preservation treatment apparatus according to the present invention is an apparatus where a biomaterial, a food (including particularly meat products of living body such as fish, meat, and shells and fresh products of plants such as fruits and vegetables) and a liquid in which oxidation progresses with time such as aging, weathering or putrefaction because of containing oxide is used as an object O, and the object is subjected to preservation treatment in a preservable state such as a freezing state, a refrigerating state, a half refrigerating state or a constant temperature state. The preservation treatment apparatus includes at least the following basic constitution as the technical features of the present invention. (Basic constitution) The preservation treatment apparatus for treating an object O containing oxide into a preservable state includes: a placing portion 1 or a fixing portion 7F having a conductive contact surface on which the object is placed or to which the object is fixed;a conductive enclosure structure (a frame structure 3 or/and a lid plate 5) configured to be formed continuously with an upper portion of the placing portion 1 or configured to be arranged in the vicinity of the placing portion 1 in a spaced-apart manner, and surrounding at least any one of both sides, front and rear sides and upper and lower sides of the object O as viewed from the object O placed on the placing surface;one or more sets of electrodes, each set of electrodes being constituted of: a DC electrode which is brought into contact with either one of the placing portion 1 and the enclosure structure; and an AC electrode which is brought into contact with the other one of the placing portion 1 and the enclosure structure respectively; anda voltage supply portion 20 electrically connected with respective electrodes which constitute the set of electrodes, and is configured to supply a negative DC voltage to one electrode of each electrode set and supply an AC voltage to the other electrode. In the above-mentioned configuration, one electrode and the other electrode which constitute the set of electrodes are respectively arranged at symmetrical positions in a spaced-apart manner along a diagonal line direction on one plane expanding outwardly as viewed from the object O placed on the placing portion 1. In a state where, in addition to a lower portion of the object O, at least any one of both sides, front and rear sides and upper side of the object O as viewed from the object O is surrounded by the conductor by the enclosure structure, the voltage supply portion 20 simultaneously applies a negative DC voltage and an AC voltage to one and the other of the electrodes which are arranged in a spaced-apart manner along both directions along a diagonal line direction where the object O is arranged close to the center on one plane expanding outwardly of either one of the placing portion 1 and the enclosure structure which surround the periphery of the object O respectively. The inventors of the present invention have carried out a comparison experiment with respect to a method of simultaneously applying a DC voltage and an AC voltage to an object O. As the result of the comparison experiment, the inventors of the present invention have found out that, in the case where one or the other of the electrode set is arranged in a diagonal line direction about the object O on a close contact surface (that is, on one plane expanding outwardly close to the object O) of at least one of the placing portion 1 or the enclosure structure, the preservation property of the object O is apparently increased compared to other electrode arrangements (for example, when both one electrode and the other electrode are arranged in a spacer-apart manner at the same height on one side when one electrode and the other electrode are viewed from the object). For example, when the comparison experiment is carried out where a cut piece of tuna and white peach which are fresh food materials are used as objects and the arrangement of positions where the electrode set is fixed to the tray-like placing portion 1 is changed, an amount of change in drip quantity and color at the time of defrosting is small only when the electrode set is arranged on any one of diagonal lines consisting to a diagonal line between a right rear side and a left front side, and a diagonal line between a left rear side and a right front side. It is considered that an effect of simultaneous application is uniformly applied to the object. (Representative constitutional example) Provided that the preservation treatment apparatus has the above-mentioned basic constitution, even when various arrangements are applied to the constitution of the enclosure structure or the arrangement of electrode sets, the advantageous effects of the present invention can be acquired. For example, as representative constitutional examples, the following two representative constitutions 1, 2 are named. (Representative constitution 1) A preservation treatment apparatus includes: a placing portion 1 having a conductive placing surface on which the object O is placed;a conductive enclosure structure (3 or/and 5) arranged at least either one of both sides or an upper side of the placing portion 1, and surrounding at least either one of both sides or the upper side of the object O as viewed from the object O placed on the placing surface;a first electrode 21 brought into contact with a position of the placing portion 1 close to one side portion 11S of the placing portion 1 as viewed from the object O placed on the placing portion 1;a second electrode 22 brought into contact with a position of the placing portion 1 close to the other side portion 12S of the placing portion 1 as viewed from the object O placed on the placing portion 1, the position being arranged on a side symmetrically opposite to the first electrode 21 as viewed in a plan view; anda voltage supply portion 20 which supplies a negative DC voltage to either one of the first electrode 21 and the second electrode 22, and simultaneously supplies an AC voltage to the other of the first electrode 21 and the second electrode 22. (Representative constitution 2) A preservation treatment apparatus includes: a placing portion 1 having a conductive placing surface on which the object O is placed;a conductive enclosure structure (3 or/and 5) arranged at least either one of both sides or an upper side of the placing portion 1, and surrounding at least either one of both sides or the upper side of the object O as viewed from the object O placed on the placing surface;a third electrode 23 brought into contact with a position of the enclosure structure 3/5 close to one side portion of the enclosure structure 3/5 as viewed from the object O placed on the placing portion 1;a fourth electrode 24 brought into contact with a position of the enclosure structure 3/5 close to one side portion or the other side portion of the enclosure structure 3/5 as viewed from the object O placed on the placing portion 1, the position being arranged on a side symmetrically opposite to the first electrode 21 as viewed in a see-through side view; anda voltage supply portion 20 which supplies a negative DC voltage to either one of the third electrode 23 and the fourth electrode 24, and simultaneously supplies an AC voltage to the other of the third electrode 23 and the fourth electrode 24.

The configuration described in an embodiment 4 (Fig. 11) may also be adopted where a placing portion and an enclosure structure are integrally arranged in the inside of an open-type shelf box, and the placing portion and the enclosure structure are movably conveyed by a movable-type compartment 4. There may be also provided the configuration described in an embodiment 5 where a hook type fixed portion 7F and a projecting frame 71 structure which projects from both side portions of the fixed portion 7F are formed into an integral body, and the integral body is moved in a suspended manner by a wire W. Further, the placing portion of one embodiment selected from these embodiments and the enclosure structure of another embodiment selected from these embodiments may be combined with each other, or these elements may be picked up and be combined with each other while changing shapes of these elements or changing the number of these elements. For example, the suspension moving method using the wire W or the moving floor method using the conveyance belt may be changed to a moving method where a placing portion and an enclosure structure are moved along a string way formed on a floor string or a moving type using wheels shown in Fig. 11.

The first electrode and the second electrode are brought into contact with both side portions of the placing portion 1 respectively, and a negative DC voltage and an AC voltage are simultaneously applied to the electrodes respectively. Due to such a constitution, the flow of an electric current from one terminal to the other terminal can be periodically changed in a short time so that a generation state of an electric energy field can be maintained while periodically changing the generation state of the electric energy field. (Applied potential) Particularly, it is preferable that a negative DC voltage be a negative potential which corresponds to an object, and an absolute value of the potential be equal to or smaller than a maximum potential of an AC voltage. By applying a negative DC potential from the other electrode while applying an AC potential from one electrode, an inner surface side of the placing portion and the enclosure structure formed of a conductor, that is, a side where the object O is stored can be held at a negative potential with a periodical change in potential, that is, electric oscillations. By storing an object in such a space, the whole area around the object is charged with positive ions. Further, by imparting electrical vibrations to the object by simultaneously applying an alternating current to the object, the progress of an oxygen activity of oxide in the object can be suppressed thus suppressing the progress of acidification or putrefaction of the object. During such simultaneous applying of an alternating current, pH of the object per se is slightly increased (approximately 0.1 to 2.0). When an object is a biomaterial or fresh food, it is preferable that a voltage potential to be applied do not exceed 10, 000V/cm in terms of an absolute value. An AC electric energy necessary for maintaining a cell is extremely small so that when an electric energy of an AC potential largely exceeding the limit is continuously applied to an object, a cell wall or a cell nucleus is broken whereby a cytoplasm (meat quality in case of a meat product) is deteriorated. It is also preferable that the voltage supply portion 20 simultaneously apply a negative DC voltage equal to the voltage applied to the first electrode 21 to either one of the third electrode 23 and the fourth electrode 24 and an AC voltage equal to the voltage applied to the second electrode 22 to the other one of the third electrode 23 and the fourth electrode 24. By allowing the third electrode 23 and the fourth electrode 24 to have the same voltage applying constitution as the first electrode 21 and the second electrode 22, the adjustment of a potential and a control can be easily performed. (Arrangement of electrodes) It is necessary to arrange the electrodes on both sides separately with the object disposed therebetween, that is, one electrode on one side of the object and the other electrode on the other side of the object. Electricity flows in the direction along which electricity can easily flow and hence, when the electrodes are not arranged uniformly, an electric effect given to an object is reduced. In a conductor which is an object to which the electrodes are brought into contact, particularly, in a conductor having a large thickness such as the placing plate on which an object is directly placed, it is preferable that one electrode be brought into contact with an upper portion of one side portion of the conductor, and the other electrode be brought into contact with a lower portion of the other side portion of the conductor. By making an electric current flow not only through an upper surface of the conductor but also through the inside and a lower surface of the conductor, a charged state of the conductor can be held in a more intensive state so that an electric energy field can be stabilized. (Enclosure structure) It is preferable that, in addition to the placing plate made of a conductive material, the enclosure structure made of a conductive material be formed on at least either one of peripheral sides or an upper side of an object. In this case, electric energy can be generated by the placing plate on which the object is placed and, at the same time, electric energy can be generated also by the enclosure structure. By surrounding the lower side and the peripheral sides of the object or the lower side and the upper side of the object by the charged conductive material, it is possible to give an effect generated by an electric energy field to the object in a superimposed manner so that an electric effect can be given to the object more effectively. Here, as a technique for surrounding an object by a conductive member, it is preferable that two or more surrounding surfaces of the enclosure structure (surfaces covering a lower surface and a peripheral surface of the object or a lower surface and an upper surface of the object) be covered by metal-made conductive fibers S. In this case, by lining and fixing metal-made conductive fibers S to a placing surface and inner surfaces of the surrounding surfaces of the enclosure structure, a state is brought about where the periphery or the whole upper portion of the object O is covered by metal-made conductive fibers S. In this case, for example, as in the case of the embodiment 3, it is preferable that at least metal-made conductive fibers S hermetically wrap the periphery of an object by a technique where metal-made conductive fibers S are laminated to the whole inner surface of a box which surrounds an object as lining. Further, for example, as in the case of the stereoscopic frame structure described in the embodiment 1, it is preferable that metal-made conductive fibers S extend over and be fixed to at least the whole peripheral surface (both side surfaces and front and rear surfaces) of the frame structure along the outermost frame. It is more preferable that metal-made conductive fibers S also extend over and be fixed to a bottom surface of the frame structure. Still further, when the lid plate 5 described in the embodiments 1, 2 is used, it is preferable that the metal-made conductive fibers S be laminated to an upper surface of the placing surface and a lower surface of the lid plate so that a state is brought about where an object O on the placing surface is sandwiched between above and below by metal-made conductive fibers S. With the use of conductive fibers having air permeability and light transmissivity as metal-made conductive fibers laminated to the lid plate 5, a temperature control and a state control based on observation with naked eyes are facilitated. Metal-made conductive fibers may be formed by dispersing and fixing conductive metal in synthetic fibers or by covering a surface of organic fibers by metal or a resin containing metal. For example, it is preferable that weak negative charged metal oxide such as copper sulfide, iron sulfide or nickel oxide be chemically bonded to acrylic fibers or nylon fibers. Those metals have a slight negative charge and exhibits a function of making a charge environment in conductive fibers S uniform. The enclosure structure is made of a conductive material (conductor), is arranged on at least either one of both sides or an upper side of the placing portion 1, and surrounds at least either one of both sides or an upper side of the object O as viewed from the object O placed on the placing surface. For example, the enclosure structure may include lid plates 5 arranged above at least the placing plate and expanding in the planar direction. It is preferable that an upper position of the lid plate 5 close to one side portion of the lid plate 5 and a lower position of the lid plate 5 close to the other side portion of the lid plate 5 be brought into contact with the third electrode and the fourth electrode respectively so that the lid 5 to which electricity is applied by the voltage supply portion form an electric energy field above the object O placed on the placing surface. The enclosure structure may also be configured to include wall plates which are arranged at least on both sides of the placing plate, and are raised upwardly from the placing plate. Here, it is necessary for the left and right wall plates on both side portions to be electrically connected with each other thus forming an integrally formed conductor. Out of the left and right wall plates on both side portions which are electrically connected with each other, an upper position of the wall plate close to one side portion as viewed from the object and a lower position of the wall plate close to the other side portion as viewed from the object are brought into contact with the third electrode and the fourth electrode respectively. Due to such a constitution, the wall plates 5 to which electricity is applied by the voltage supply portion form an electric energy field at both side portions of the object O placed on the placing surface. The enclosure structure may also be configured to include both the lid plates 5 arranged above the placing plate and expanding in the planar direction and the wall plates which are arranged on both sides of the placing plate, brought into contact with both side portions of the lid plate 5 respectively, and raised upwardly from the placing plate as an integral body. By forming the lid plates and the wall plates as an integral body in this manner, the enclosure structure adopts the conductor structure having an inverted U shaped cross section as viewed in a front elevation view. Alternatively, the enclosure structure adopts the conductor structure having a rectangular cross section as viewed in a front elevation view by connecting a bottom plate to the conductor structure having an inverted U shaped cross section. In such cases, for example, the third electrode is brought into contact with an upper end of one wall plate and the fourth electrode is brought into contact with an upper end of the other wall plate, and a negative DC voltage and an AC voltage are simultaneously applied to the third electrode and the fourth electrode respectively. Due to such a constitution, both the wall plates and the lid plates can be brought into a state where a negative DC voltage and an AC voltage are simultaneously applied to these plates so that an electric energy field which surrounds three peripheral sides of the placing plate can be generated. Alternatively, in such cases, the lid plates and the wall plates extending on left and right sides respectively may be formed independently from each other, and the third electrode and the fourth electrode may be brought into contact with both side portions of the respective plates. The preservation treatment apparatus of the present invention may further include, as the basic constitution thereof, a chamber 4 formed so as to surround the placing portion 1 and both sides or an upper portion of the enclosure structure 3/5, and a temperature adjuster F which cools the inside of the chamber 4. By applying a negative DC voltage and an AC voltage to the electrodes by the voltage supply portion 20 and, at the same time, by controlling a temperature of the object O placed on the placing portion 1 by the temperature adjuster F, it is possible to bring the object into a preservation state while placing the object in an electric energy field. Hereinafter, the constitution and the structure of the respective embodiments are described in detail.

The third electrode 23 and the fourth electrode 24 of the embodiment 1 are arranged as a pair on left and right sides respectively at a plurality of arrangement portions along the belt advancing direction such that the third electrode 23 is brought into contact with one of an upper surface of one edge and a lower surface of one edge of the lid plate 5 and the fourth electrode 23 is brought into contact with the other of the upper surface of one edge and the lower surface of one edge of the lid plate 5 (Frame structure 3) To be more specific, the frame structure 3 is constituted of: a plurality of columnar-shaped side assembled frame members 31; lower assembled frame members 32 which are fixed to lower ends of the side assembled frame members 31 and are connected to each other in an approximately horizontal manner; and the upper assembled frame members 33 which are fixed to upper ends of the side assembled frame members 31 and are connected to each other in an approximately horizontal manner. All assembled frame members are formed of rod-shaped frame members having a rectangular cross section, and are formed into an integral frame. The side frame members 31 of the frame structure 3 are provided in a raised manner at plural portions along the belt advancing direction in a spaced-apart manner. The lower frame members 32 of the frame structure 3 are assembled into a quadrangular-shaped frame in the planar direction at a bottom portion of a tunnel like space. The upper frame members 33 of the frame structure 3 are configured such that the respective frame members 33 extend in the approximately horizontal direction and are formed into an integral frame. The upper frame members 33 are assembled into a quadrangular-shaped frame in the planar direction above the belt structure, and an intermediate frame member 33C extends at an intermediate portion of the frame in the belt advancing direction and at an intermediate portion of the frame in the width direction. (Lid plates 5) The lid plate 5 is formed of a set of left and right openable lids which are disposed on left and right sides in a separate manner. Two sets of lid plates 5 are arranged in a separate manner along the belt advancing direction. The respective lid plates 5 are fixed by hinges along side frame members of the upper frame members 33 which extend parallel to the belt advancing direction. When the lid plates 5 are mounted on the intermediate member 33C, the lid plates 5 are maintained in a closed state (S). On the other hand, when the lid plates 5 are raised on the side frame members, the lid plates 5 are maintained in an open state (O). To perform the maintenance or the adjustment of an electric energy field, as shown in Fig. 1, by bringing some sets of lid plate 5 into an open state (O) while bringing the remaining sets of lid plate 5 into a closed state (S), it is possible to change a time during which an effect of an electric energy field is given to an object O to be conveyed on the belt body. The lid plate 5 is formed of a porous plate where a large number of holes 5H are formed in a plate frame. Holes may be formed by netting wires 5W as shown in Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b, or may be formed by applying blanking to a conductive metal plate as shown in Fig. 7c and Fig. 7d. (Chamber 4 and temperature adjuster F) The chamber 4 is formed of a tunnel-like space having an inlet and an exit on both front and rear ends thereof respectively, and surrounding the belt structure, the frame structure 3 and the lid plate 5.

[Embodiment 2] A preservation treatment apparatus of a second embodiment shown in Fig. 9 includes: a water tank 6 provided with a freezing mechanism which holds a freezing liquid 6S in a chamber 4; upper and lower sandwiching belts 1UB, 1LB which passes through the freezing liquid 6S in the water tank 6 in an immersed manner; and an ingot belt structure which is configured such that ingots 1I made of a plurality of metal blocks are connected to each other in a belt shape, and the ingots on an upper side are half-immersed in the freezing liquid 6S. A hollow lid 5 is fixed above the ingot belt, and a third electrode and a fourth electrode are connected to an upper portion of one end of the hollow lid 5 and a lower portion of the other end of the hollow lid 5 respectively. Further, a first electrode and a second electrode are connected to an upper portion of one end of the water tank and a lower portion of the other end of the water tank respectively. The hollow lid 5 is formed of a punching plate having a large number of ventilation holes 5H as shown in Fig. 7c or Fig. 7d, and metal-based conductive fibers are laminated to the hollow lid 5 such that the conductive fibers cover the whole lower surface of the hollow lid 5 including the ventilation holes 5H. Cold air from the breeze F1 which is the temperature adjuster F mounted along a ceiling part of the chamber 4 hits an upper portion of the hollow lid 5. Cold air from the breeze F1 which is the temperature adjuster F cools the inside of the chamber 4 and an object O1 above the ingot belt. Due to the above-mentioned constitution, it is possible to provide a hybrid freezing machine which can perform both liquid freezing where an object 02 having liquid resistance is frozen by making the object 02 pass through a freezing liquid while conveying the object 02 and belt conveyance freezing where an object O1 having no liquid resistance is frozen by conveying the object O1 by an ingot belt. [Embodiment 3] The preservation treatment apparatus of the embodiment 3 shown in Fig. 10 includes the enclosure structure having a hermetically sealed box shape which also functions as a placing portion 1, wherein the enclosure structure is formed of: a storing box for storing an object O which is placed hermetically and at rest in the inside of the chamber 4 and is formed of the placing box 10; and a lid frame 50 which hermetically seals the storing box by covering an upper opening of the storing box. Metal-based conductive fibers S are laminated to an inner surface of the hermetically sealed box. In the preservation treatment apparatus of this embodiment, an object O placed in the inside of the hermetically sealed box is wrapped by metal-based conductive fibers S. To be more specific, metal-based conducive fibers S are acquired by forming organic fibers into which copper sulfide which is a charging material is impregnated into a fabric or a non-fabric. Metal-based conducive fibers S are organic conductive fibers having surface resistance of 80 to 100Ω/m2 and are formed using semiconductor fibers for small charging thus suppressing the surplus electrical conduction around an object while securing antibacterial property. Further, the fibers S are liable to be negatively charged and hence, by applying a negative DC voltage to one electrode out of a set of electrodes, it is possible to continuously hold some positive electrostatic property around an object O. In the hermetically sealed box, a conductive packing 1P is laminated to an upper portion of the placing box. A gap formed between the hermetically sealed box and the lid frame 50 when the hermetically sealed box is hermetically sealed is filled with the conductive packing 1P, and the lid frame and the placing box are electrically connected with each other. One set or two sets of first electrode, second electrode, third electrode and fourth electrode are connected to side walls shown in Fig. 10(a) to Fig. 10(d) at respective positions. [Embodiment 4] In a preservation treatment apparatus according to an embodiment 4 shown in Fig. 11, a plurality of shelf frames 30 each of which stores a large number of placing portions 1 which form shelf plates are stored in the inside of a movable chamber electric car 4C having electricity receiving arms 20A which are brought into contact with two overhead wires 23W, 24W stretched above the preservation treatment apparatus. The chamber 4 is the chamber electric car 4C which self-travels by receiving electricity along the overhead wires 23W, 24W by means of wheels 4R mounted on a lower portion of the chamber 4. Power source supply portions 20α, 20β mounted on an upper portion of the electric car receive electricity from the overhead wires 23W, 24W respectively and perform the adjustment of an AC potential, AC/DC conversion and the adjustment of potential. The power source supply portions 20α, 20β are respectively electrically connected to two connectors 23C, 24C mounted on a side portion of the shelf frame through conductive lines 23L, 24L arranged on an inner wall of the chamber electric car. In the shelf frame 30, an electric wire covered with a silicon cover is connected along a side of the frame between the connector 23C and the third electrode 23 disposed at a corner on a deep side of an upper portion of one side portion of the frame. On the other hand, an electric wire covered with a silicon cover is connected along a side of the frame between the connector 24C and the fourth electrode 24 disposed at a corner on a front side of a lower portion of the other side portion of the frame. The placing plate 1 which is a shelf plate is a conductive plate and receives a potential from the shelf frame. [Embodiment 5] A preservation treatment apparatus according to an embodiment 5 shown in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 adopts the suspending pulley structure of a self-traveling wheel 70R type where pulley wheels 70R which are mounted on one overhead wire W stretched in an upper portion of the preservation treatment apparatus are rotated by their own power. The pulley wheel includes an engaging hook 7F which engageably supports an object in a suspending manner, and the pulley wheels receive voltages of a negative DC potential and an AC potential from walls of both side portions by means of contact rollers 74R, 75R attached to projecting frames 71 projecting toward both sides of the engaging hook 7F in vertical symmetry. The chamber 4 is formed of a passage bent in an inverted U shape ranging from an entrance seat 4C disposed on a right side facing Fig. 12 to an exit seat 4C disposed on a left side facing Fig. 12. One overhead wire W is stretched in an upper portion of the preservation treatment apparatus along an advancing direction of the passage, and the suspending pulley structure of a self-traveling wheel 70R type suspended from the stretched overhead wire W conveys an object O. After the conveyance is performed, cooling or freezing of the object O is completed. A roller frame 4F is mounted on both side walls of the chamber respectively, and the roller frame 4F is stretched on the whole sides at vertical positions where the roller frame 4F is brought into contact with the contact rollers 74R, 75R, and the respective contact rollers advance along the roller frame 4F. However, insulators 74G, 75G having a circuler cross section are slidably provided on a right upper side and a left lower side facing the advancing direction in place of contact rollers, and electricity is received only by contact rollers 74R, 75R on a right lower side and a left upper side facing the advancing direction.
