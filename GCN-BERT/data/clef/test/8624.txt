Example 20
To a suspension of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.100 g, 0.408 mmol) and 4-cyclopropyl-1,3-thiazole carboxylic acid (0.079 g, 0.469 mmol), and pyridine (0.15 mL, 1.832 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.85 mL, 1.431 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 48.5° C. for 7 days. After cooling, the mixture was quenched with water (10 mL) and extracted with 8:2 dichloromethane/isopropanol (2×25 mL) followed by washing once with sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The crude mixture was purified by precipitation in minium amount of 1:1 dichloromethane/diethyl ether mixture. The obtained solid was collected by filtration and washed with cold dichloromethane to give 4-cyclopropyl-N-(4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)thiazole-5-carboxamide (0.129 g, 80%) as a green crystalline solid.
