[Synthesis Example 1] Synthesis of 3-methylcitronellal (3,3,7-trimethyl-6-octenal) (Exemplary Compound 3)
This reaction was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. A 2-L four-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel was prepared, and copper iodide (100 g, 1.05 eq.) and diethyl ether (200 mL) were added to the flask, and the inside of the system was cooled to 0 to 5° C. while stirring. A methyllithium-ether solution (1.08 mol/L, 992 mL, 2.05 eq. vs. CuI) was added to the dropping funnel, and then dropped slowly over 2 hours. After completion of the dropping, stirring was performed for 30 minutes while maintaining the temperature, and then, the inside of the system was cooled to −60° C. or lower. Citral (76.1 g, 500 mmol) and diethyl ether (50 mL) were added to the dropping funnel, and then dropped slowly over 20 minutes. After completion, stirring was performed for 1 hour while maintaining the temperature, and the temperature in the system was gradually increased to 0 to 5° C. After 1 hour, completion of the reaction was confirmed by GC, and as a post-treatment, a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution was dropped slowly while cooling. The mixed solution was filtered through celite, and the oil layer was washed three times with a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution and once with a saturated saline solution, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, followed by concentration under reduced pressure (78.4 g). This reaction was performed three times in total, and the obtained oil was subjected to simple distillation using a Claisen distillation apparatus (0.1 mmHg, overhead: 60 to 65° C., bath temperature: 85 to 95° C.), whereby an objective substance (180 g, yield: 72%) was obtained.
