4. Synthesis of Methyl 3,7-dihyroxy-6-ethyl-7-d-5-cholan-24-oate (compound 6)
Methyl 3-hyroxy-6-ethyl-7-keto-5-cholan-24-oate (1.5 g, 3.5 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (6 ml) in a flask and stirred. Sodium borodeuteride (NaBD4, 0.3 g, 7 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich) was added and the mixture was stirred for another 3 h at room temperature. Water was added to quench the reaction. The mixture was concentrated under high vacuum and extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic fraction was washed subsequently with water and brine, dried with Na2SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to afford the target compound (1.3 g, 85%).
