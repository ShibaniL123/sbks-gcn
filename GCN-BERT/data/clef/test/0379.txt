The seventh step
To a solution of Compound 11 (232mg, 0.533mmol) in DMF (2.32 mL) were added potassium carbonate (147 mg, 1.07 mmol) and iodomethane (0.100 mL, 1.56 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 14 hours and 35 minutes. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of ice water and saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 12 (211mg, yield 88.1%).
