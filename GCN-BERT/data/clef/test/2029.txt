Example 3
To a suspension of 5-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)indolin-2-one (0.050 g, 0.203 mmol) and 2,4-dimethylthiazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.035 g, 0.224 mmol), and pyridine (0.06 mL, 0.713 mmol) in acetonitrile (2 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.29 mL, 0.489 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 48.5Â° C. for 4 days and the precipitation formed. After cooling, the solid was collected by filtration and washed with cold dichloromethane to give 2,4-dimethyl-N-(4-(2-oxoindolin-5-yl)thiazol-2-yl)thiazole-5-carboxamide (0.045 g, 58%) as a beige solid.
