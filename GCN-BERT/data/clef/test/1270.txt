(Reference Example 23) Synthesis of (E)-methyl 3-(1-ethyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)acrylate:
Methyl (triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate (3.15 g, 9.42 mmol) was added to a solution of 1-ethyl-1H-imidazole-2-carbaldehyde (1.17 g, 9.42 mmol) in dichloromethane (28.3 mL) at room temperature. The reaction liquid was stirred for 16 hours and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was washed with a mixed solvent of hexane/dichloromethane = 20/1 and the washing solution was concentrated. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, hexane/ethyl acetate) to obtain (E)-methyl 3-(1-ethyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)acrylate (0.670 g, 3.72 mmol, 39%) as a white solid.
