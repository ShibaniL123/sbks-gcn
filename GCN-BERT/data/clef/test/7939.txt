COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING POLYPEPTIDES HAVING PHOSPHOLIPASE C ACTIVITY AND USE THEREOF Reference to a Sequence Listing This application contains a Sequence Listing in computer readable form, which is incorporated herein by reference. Background of the Invention Field of the Invention The present invention relates to compositions comprising a plurality of polypeptides having phospholipase C activity, wherein at least one of said polypeptides having phospholipase C activity is a polypeptide derived from a fungus, and at least one of said polypeptides having phospholipase C activity is a polypeptide derived from a bacterium. The invention also relates to such compositions, for use in processes such as for degumming of an aqueous carbohydrate solution or slurry, and for degumming of oil. The invention further relates to a process for hydrolysing a phospholipid or lysophospholipid, comprising contacting said phospholipid or lysophospholipid with a composition as defined above. Description of the Related Art Several types of phospholipases are known which differ in their specificity according to the position of the bond attacked in the phospholipid molecule. Phospholipase A1 (PLA1 ) removes the 1 -position fatty acid to produce free fatty acid and 1 -lyso-2-acylphospholipid. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) removes the 2-position fatty acid to produce free fatty acid and 1 -acyl-2- lysophospholipid. The term phospholipase B (PLB) is used for phospholipases having both A1 and A2 activity. Phospholipase C (PLC) removes the phosphate moiety to produce 1 ,2 diacylglycerol and phosphate ester. Phospholipase D (PLD) produces 1 ,2-diacylglycero- phosphate and base group (See Figure 1 ). Before consumption vegetable oils are degummed to provide refined storage stable vegetable oils of neutral taste and light color. The degumming process comprises removing the phospholipid components (the gum) from the triglyceride rich oil fraction. The most commonly used processes in the industry are water degumming, chemical/caustic refining and physical refining including acid assisted degumming and/or enzyme assisted degumming. Due to the emulsifying properties of the phospholipid components, the degumming procedure has resulted in a loss of oil i.e. of triglycerides. Enzymatic degumming reduces the oils loss due to an efficient hydrolysis of the phospholipids which decrease the gum formation and reduce the oil entrained in the gum phase. For a review on enzymatic degumming see Dijkstra 2010 Eur. J. Lipid Sci. Technol. 1 12, 1 178. The use of Phospholipase A and/or phospholipase C in degumming is for example described in Clausen 2001 Eur J Lipid Sci Techno 103 333-340, WO 2003/089620 and WO 2008/094847. Phospholipase A solutions generate lysophospholipid and free fatty acids resulting in oil loss. Phospholipase C on the other hand has the advantage that it produces diglyceride (Figure 2) which will remain in the oil and therefore will reduce losses. There are four major phospholipids in vegetable oil phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidyl inositol (PI). Phospholipase C enzymes have different specificity towards these phospholipids. The only known commercially available phospholipase C is (f) PURIFINE® PLC of Verenium/DSM (Dijkstra, 101 st AOCS Annual Meeting 10. May 2010) which has specificity towards PC and PE. WO07/059927 describes a thermostable Bacillus PLC for degumming. WO 2012/062817 describes a fungal PLC with specificity towards all four phospholipids. A Pl-specific phospholipase C has been described in WO 201 1/046815. Despite the availability of such phospholipases, there is a need to improve the efficacy of the enzymatic hydrolysis of phospholipids by decreasing the reaction time of the conversion into diacylglycerol and phosphate ester, while providing broad substrate specificity. Summary of the Invention The present invention relates to a composition comprising a plurality of polypeptides having phospholipase C activity, wherein - at least one of said polypeptides having phospholipase C activity is a polypeptide derived from a fungus; and - at least one of said polypeptides having phospholipase C activity is a polypeptide derived from a bacterium. The invention further provides such a composition, for use in i) degumming of an aqueous carbohydrate solution or slurry, in degumming of oil, e.g. vegetable oil, or an edible vegetable oil, or in a process comprising hydrolysis of phospholipids in the gum fraction from water degumming to release entrapped triglyceride oil, ii) a process comprising hydrolysis of phospholipids to obtain improved phospholipid emulsifiers, in particular wherein said phospholipid is lecithin, iii) a process for improving the filterability of an aqueous solution or slurry of carbohydrate origin which contains phospholipid, iv) a process for the extraction of oil, v) a process for the production of an animal feed product, vi) a process for the production of a biofuel, e.g. a biodiesel, vii) in a process for the production of a detergent product, and/or viii) in a process for making a baked product, comprising adding the phospholipase to a dough, and baking the dough to make the baked product. Finally, the invention provides a process for hydrolysing a phospholipid or lysophospholipid, comprising contacting said phospholipid or lysophospholipid with a plurality of polypeptides having phospholipase C activity and/or a composition according to the invention. Brief Description of the Figures Figure 1 illustrates where different phospholipases cleave a phospholipid as well as the four major functional groups on phospholipids. Figure 2 illustrates the reaction of a phospholipid with a phospholipase C to form diglyceride and a phosphate ester or phosphoric acid. Definitions Phospholipase C activity: The term "phospholipase C activity" or "PLC activity" relates to an enzymatic activity that removes the phosphate ester moiety from a phospholipid to produce a 1 ,2 diacylglycerol (see Figure 2). Most PLC enzymes belong to the family of hydrolases and phosphodiesterases and are generally classified as EC 3.1 .4.3. Some PLC enzymes are classified in other EC classes, for example Pl-specific PLC's. Phospholipase C activity may be determined according to the procedure described in Example 1 or by one of the assays described in the "Assay for phospholipase activity" section. Phospholipase A activity: In the context of the present invention the term "phospholipase A activity" comprises enzymes having phospholipase A1 and/or phospholipase A2 activity (A1 or A2, EC 3.1 .1.32 or EC 3.1 .1 .4), i.e., hydrolytic activity towards one or both carboxylic ester bonds in phospholipids such as lecithin. A phospholipases having both A1 and A2 activity is also referred to as a phospholipase B. Phospholipase A activity may be determined by one of the assays described in the "Assay for phospholipase activity" section. For purposes of the present invention, phospholipase A activity may also be determined using a LEU assay, in which the phospholipase A activity is determined from the ability to hydrolyze lecithin at pH 8.0, 40°C. The hydrolysis reaction can be followed by titration with NaOH for a reaction time of 2 minutes. The phospholipase from Fusarium oxysporum (LIPOPAN F) disclosed in WO 1998/26057 has an activity of 1540 LEU/mg enzyme protein and may be used as a standard. In one aspect, the polypeptides of the present invention have at least 20%, e.g., at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 100% of the phospholipase A activity of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 46 and/or of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 47. In addition to having phospholipase A activity, the polypeptides of the present invention may also have lipase activity. Assays for phospholipase activity: Routine protocols for determining the activity phospholipase A, C, are well known in the art. Exemplary activity assays include turbidity assays, methylumbelliferyl phosphocholine (fluorescent) assays, Amplex red (fluorescent) phospholipase assays, thin layer chromatography assays (TLC), cytolytic assays and p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholineassays. Using these assays polypeptides, peptides or antibodies can be quickly screened for a phospholipase activity. Plate assays with a substrate containing agar can be used to determine phospholipase activity. Useful substrates are lecithin or specific phospholipids. The assay can be conducted as follows. Plates are casted by mixing of 5 ml 2% Agarose (Litex HSA 1000) prepared by mixing and cooking in buffers (100 mM HEPES and 100 mM Citrate with pH adjusted from pH 3.0 to pH 7.0) for 5 minutes followed by cooling to approximately 60°C and 5ml substrate (L-alfa Phosohatidylcholine, 95% from Soy (Avanti 441601 ) or L-ophosphatidylinositol from Soy (Avanti 840044P) for Pl-specificity or L-a-phosphatidylethanolamine from Soy (Avanti 840024P) or lecithin) dispersed in water (MilliQ) at 60°C for 1 minute with Ultra Turrax for PC- specificity) gently mixed into petri dishes with diameter of 7 cm and cooled to room temperature before holes with a diameter of approximately 3 mm were punched by vacuum. Ten microliters of purified enzyme diluted to 0.4 mg/ml is added into each well before plates were sealed by parafilm and placed in an incubator at 55°C for 48 hours. Plates were taken out for photography at regular intervals. Turbidity assays to determine phospholipase activity are described, e.g., in Kauffmann (2001 ) "Conversion of Bacillus thermocatenulatus lipase into an efficient phospholipase with increased activity towards long-chain fatty acyl substrates by directed evolution and rational design," Protein Engineering 14:919-928; Ibrahim (1995) "Evidence implicating phospholipase as a virulence factor of Candida albicans," Infect. Immun. 63:1993-1998. Methylumbelliferyl (fluorescent) phosphocholine assays to determine phospholipase activity are described, e.g., in Goode (1997) "Evidence for cell surface internal phospholipase activity in ascidian eggs," Develop. Growth Differ. 39:655-660; Diaz (1999) "Direct fluorescence-based lipase activity assay," BioTechniques 27:696-700. Amplex Red (fluorescent) Phospholipase Assays to determine phospholipase activity are available as kits, e.g., the detection of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase using an Amplex Red phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase assay kit from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR), according to manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence is measured in a fluorescence microplate reader using excitation at 560 ± 10nm and fluorescence detection at 590 ± 10 nm. The assay is sensitive at very low enzyme concentrations. Thin layer chromatography assays (TLC) to determine phospholipase activity are described, e.g., in Reynolds (1991 ) Methods in Enzymol. 197:3-13; Taguchi (1975) "Phospholipase from Clostridium novyi type A.I," Biochim. Biophys. Acta 409:75-85. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is a widely used technique for detection of phospholipase activity. Various modifications of this method have been used to extract the phospholipids from the aqueous assay mixtures. In some PLC assays the hydrolysis is stopped by addition of chloroform/methanol (2: 1 ) to the reaction mixture. The unreacted starting material and the diacylglycerol are extracted into the organic phase and may be fractionated by TLC, while the head group product remains in the aqueous phase. For more precise measurement of the phospholipid digestion, radio labeled substrates can be used (see, e.g., Reynolds (1991 ) Methods in Enzymol. 197:3-13). The ratios of products and reactants can be used to calculate the actual number of moles of substrate hydrolyzed per unit time. If all the components are extracted equally, any losses in the extraction will affect all components equally. Separation of phospholipid digestion products can be achieved by silica gel TLC with chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4) used as a solvent system (see, e.g., Taguchi (1975) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 409:75-85). p-Nitrophenylphosphorylcholine assays to determine phospholipase activity are described, e.g., in Korbsrisate (1999) J. Clin. Microbiol. 37:3742-3745; Berka (1981 ) Infect. Immun. 34:1071 -1074. This assay is based on enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate analog p- nitrophenylphosphorylcholine to liberate a yellow chromogenic compound p-nitrophenol, detectable at 405 nm. This substrate is convenient for high throughput screening. Similar assays using substrates towards the other phospholipid groups can also be applied e.g. using p-nitrophenylphosphorylinositol or p-nitrophenylphosphorylethanolamine. A cytolytic assay can detect phospholipases with cytolytic activity based on lysis of erythrocytes. Toxic phospholipases can interact with eukaryotic cell membranes and hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, leading to cell lysis. See, e.g., Titball (1993) Microbiol. Rev. 57:347-366. Further assays like 31P-NMR and Liquid Chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS) are described in the example section of this application. PC and PE-specific phospholipase C: The terms "PC and PE-specific phospholipase C" and "PC, PE-specific phospholipase C" and "polypeptide having activity towards phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)" are used interchangeably. They relate to a polypeptide having activity towards phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). In addition to the PC and PE specificity it may also have some activity towards phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidyl inositol (PI). Preferably a PC and PE specific phospholipase C removes at least 30% PC and at least 30% PE from an oil or fat with at least 100 ppm PC and 100 ppm PE when using the P-NMR assay of Example 1 at the optimal pH of the enzyme and an enzyme dosage of 10 mg/kg.

They relate to a polypeptide having activity towards phosphatidyl inositol (PI), meaning that its activity towards phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidic acid (PA) is low compared to the PI activity. Pl- specific phospholipase C enzymes can either belong to the family of hydrolases and phosphodiesterases classified as EC 3.1 .4.1 1 or to the family of lyases classified as EC 4.6.1.13. Pl-specific phospholipase C activity may be determined according to the procedure described in Example 5. Preferably a Pl-specific phospholipase C removes at least 30% PI from an oil or fat with at least 50 ppm PI when using the P-NMR assay of Example 1 at the optimal pH of the enzyme and an enzyme dosage of 10 mg/kg. More preferably it removes 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% or 80%, even more preferred it removes 90% and most preferred it removes between 90% and 100% of the PI in the oil or fat. Preferably a Pl-specific Phospholipase C removes at least 20% more PI when compared to the amount of PC, PE or PA it can remove, more preferred at least 30%, 40%, even more preferred at least 50% and most preferred at least 60% more PI when compared to the amount of PC, PE or PA it can remove.

It will be understood that this composition may have any of the characteristics and features set forth in relation to the other compositions disclosed above. Also, the said mature polypeptide may comprise or consists of amino acid residues 24- 328 of SEQ I D NO: 41 and/or the said variant in (d) may comprise amino acid residues 56-195 of SEQ ID NO: 41 . The said fragment in item (e) above may in some embodiments comprise amino acid residues 56-195 of SEQ ID NO: 41 . It is further contemplated that the composition according to the invention comprises one or more polypeptides selected from the group consisting of a phospholipase A1 , a phospholipase A2, a phospholipase B, a phospholipase D and a protease, an aminopeptidase, amylase, carbohydrase, carboxypeptidase, catalase, cellulase, chitinase, cutinase, cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase, deoxyribonuclease, esterase, alpha-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase, glucoamylase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, haloperoxidase, invertase, laccase, lipase, mannosidase, oxidase, pectinolytic enzyme, peptidoglutaminase, peroxidase, phytase, polyphenoloxidase, proteolytic enzyme, ribonuclease, transglutaminase, or xylanase In relation to items (a), (f) and/or (k) as defined in each of the aspects and embodiments set forth above, the a polypeptide having at least 65% sequence identity to the mature polypeptide defined by any one of the sequence identifiers provided in item (a) of the particular embodiment, e.g., at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91 %, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100%. Further, in relation to each of the above embodiments, the polypeptide may have been isolated. According to each of the aspects and embodiments of the invention, the variants of each mature polypeptide may comprise a substitution, deletion, and/or insertion at one or more (e.g., several) positions. In an embodiment, the number of amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions introduced into the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 is up to 10, e.g., 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. The amino acid changes may be of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions or insertions that do not significantly affect the folding and/or activity of the protein; small deletions, typically of 1 -30 amino acids; small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an amino-terminal methionine residue; a small linker peptide of up to 20-25 residues; or a small extension that facilitates purification by changing net charge or another function, such as a poly-histidine tract, an antigenic epitope or a binding domain. Examples of conservative substitutions are within the groups of basic amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine), acidic amino acids (glutamic acid and aspartic acid), polar amino acids (glutamine and asparagine), hydrophobic amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine), and small amino acids (glycine, alanine, serine, threonine and methionine). Amino acid substitutions that do not generally alter specific activity are known in the art and are described, for example, by H. Neurath and R.L. Hill, 1979, In, The Proteins, Academic Press, New York. Common substitutions are Ala/Ser, Val/lle, Asp/Glu, Thr/Ser, Ala/Gly, Ala/Thr, Ser/Asn, Ala/Val, Ser/Gly, Tyr/Phe, Ala/Pro, Lys/Arg, Asp/Asn, Leu/lle, LeuA al, Ala/Glu, and Asp/Gly. Alternatively, the amino acid changes are of such a nature that the physico-chemical properties of the polypeptides are altered. For example, amino acid changes may improve the thermal stability of the polypeptide, alter the substrate specificity, change the pH optimum, and the like. As the skilled person will know, essential amino acids in a polypeptide can be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine- scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, 1989, Science 244: 1081 -1085). In the latter technique, single alanine mutations are introduced at every residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for Phospholipase C activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. See also, Hilton et al., 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271 : 4699-4708. The active site of the enzyme or other biological interaction can also be determined by physical analysis of structure, as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography, electron diffraction, or photoaffinity labeling, in conjunction with mutation of putative contact site amino acids. See, for example, de Vos et al., 1992, Science 255: 306-312; Smith et al., 1992, J. Mol. Biol. 224: 899-904; Wlodaver et al., 1992, FEBS Lett. 309: 59-64. The identity of essential amino acids can also be inferred from an alignment with a related polypeptide. Single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions can be made and tested using known methods of mutagenesis, recombination, and/or shuffling, followed by a relevant screening procedure, such as those disclosed by Reidhaar-Olson and Sauer, 1988, Science 241 : 53-57; Bowie and Sauer, 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 2152-2156; WO 95/17413; or WO 95/22625. Other methods that can be used include error-prone PCR, phage display (e.g., Lowman et al., 1991 , Biochemistry 30: 10832-10837; U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409; WO 92/06204), and region-directed mutagenesis (Derbyshire et al., 1986, Gene 46: 145; Ner ei a/., 1988, DNA 7: 127). Mutagenesis/shuffling methods can be combined with high-throughput, automated screening methods to detect activity of cloned, mutagenized polypeptides expressed by host cells (Ness et al., 1999, Nature Biotechnology 17: 893-896). Mutagenized DNA molecules that encode active polypeptides can be recovered from the host cells and rapidly sequenced using standard methods in the art. These methods allow the rapid determination of the importance of individual amino acid residues in a polypeptide. According to each aspect and embodiment of the invention, the polypeptide may be a hybrid polypeptide in which a region of one polypeptide is fused at the N-terminus or the C-terminus of a region of another polypeptide. The polypeptide may be a fusion polypeptide or cleavable fusion polypeptide in which another polypeptide is fused at the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the polypeptide of the present invention. A fusion polypeptide is produced by fusing a polynucleotide encoding another polypeptide to a polynucleotide of the present invention. Techniques for producing fusion polypeptides are known in the art, and include ligating the coding sequences encoding the polypeptides so that they are in frame and that expression of the fusion polypeptide is under control of the same promoter(s) and terminator. Fusion polypeptides may also be constructed using intein technology in which fusion polypeptides are created post-translationally (Cooper et al., 1993, EMBO J. 12: 2575-2583; Dawson et ai, 1994, Science 266: 776-779). A fusion polypeptide can further comprise a cleavage site between the two polypeptides. Upon secretion of the fusion protein, the site is cleaved releasing the two polypeptides. Examples of cleavage sites include, but are not limited to, the sites disclosed in Martin et ai, 2003, J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 3: 568-576; Svetina et ai, 2000, J.

In a preferred embodiment the oil is an edible oil. More preferred, the edible oil is selected from rice bran, rapeseeds, palm, peanuts and other nuts, soybean, corn, canola, and sunflower oils. The plurality of polypeptides having Phospholipase C activity and the compositions of the invention can be used in any "degumming" procedure, including water degumming, ALCON oil degumming (e.g., for soybeans), safinco degumming, "super degumming," UF degumming, TOP degumming, uni-degumming, dry degumming and ENZYMAX™ degumming. See, for example, WO 2007/103005, US 2008/0182322, US 6,355,693, US 6,162,623, US 6,103,505, US 6,001 ,640, US 5,558,781 and US 5,264,367 for description of degumming processes where phospholipases of the present invention can be applied. Various "degumming" procedures incorporated by the methods of the invention are described in Bockisch, M. (1998) In Fats and Oils Handbook, The extraction of Vegetable Oils (Chapter 5), 345-5 445, AOCS Press, Champaign, Illinois. The plurality of polypeptides having Phospholipase C activity and compositions of the invention can be used in the industrial application of enzymatic degumming of triglyceride oils as described, e.g., in EP 513 709. In a further embodiment the oil is selected from crude oil, water degummed oil, caustic refined oil and acid degummed oil. The water-degumming of a crude oil or fat may be achieved by thoroughly mixing hot water and warm oil or fat having a temperature of between 50°C to 90°C for 30 to 60 minutes. This process serves to partially remove the hydratable phospholipids. Also, an acid treatment may be performed before the enzymatic degumming, where the acid used is selected from the group consisting of phosphoric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, and mixtures thereof, in particular a treatment using citric acid or phosphoric acid are preferred. The acid treatment is preferably followed by a neutralization step to adjust the pH between about 4.0 to 7.0, more preferably from 4.5 to 6.5, preferably using NaOH or KOH. The acid treatment serves to chelate metals bound to the phospholipids hereby making a more hydratable form. Preferably, the phospholipases as described herein is added after water degumming or acid treatment of the oil. It is also possible to perform the degumming step using the plurality of polypeptides having Phospholipase C activity and/or the compositions as described herein on a crude oil or fat, i.e. an oil or fat not previously water degummed or acid treated. In one aspect, the invention provides methods for enzymatic degumming under conditions of low water, e.g., in the range of between about 0.1 % to 20 % water or 0.5% to 10% water. In one aspect, this results in the improved separation of a heavy phase from the oil phase during centrifugation. The improved separation of these phases can result in more efficient removal of phospholipids from the oil, including both hydratable and nonhydratable phospholipids. In one aspect, this can produce a gum fraction that contains less entrained neutral oil (triglycerides), thereby improving the overall yield of oil during the degumming process. In one aspect, the plurality of polypeptides having Phospholipase C activity and the compositions of the invention are used to treat oils to reduce gum mass and increase neutral oil gain through reduced oil entrapment. In one aspect, the plurality of polypeptides having Phospholipase C activity and the compositions of the invention are used for diacylglycerol (DAG) production and to contribute to the oil phase. In particular embodiments, the oil is contacted with 0.5-200 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phospholipases; such as with 0.5-100 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phospholipases, with 0.5-25 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phospholipases, with 0.5-15 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phospholipase. with 0.5-10 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phospholipase, with 0.5-5 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phospholipase, with 1 -200 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phospholipase, with 1 -100 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phosphol ipase, with 1 -25 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phosphol ipase, with 1 -15 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phosphol ipase, with 1 -10 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phosphol ipase, with 1 -5 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phosphol ipase, with 2-200 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phosphol ipase, with 2-100 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phosphol ipase, with 2-50 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phosphol ipase, with 2-25 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phosphol ipase, with 2-15 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phosphol ipase, with 2-10 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phosphol ipase, with 2-7 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phospholipase, or with 2-5 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal and bacterial phospholipase. In preferred embodiments the oil is contacted with 5-50 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal phospholipase; and 0.5-20 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said bacterial phospholipase. In further embodiments, the oil is contacted with 5-40 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal phospholipase; and 1-15 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said bacterial phospholipase. In still further embodiments, the oil is contacted with 5-30 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal phospholipase; and 1 -15 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said bacterial phospholipase. In other embodiments, the oil is contacted with 10-30 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said fungal phospholipase; and 1 -5 mg enzyme protein (EP)/Kg oil of said bacterial phospholipase. The phospholipase treatment can be conducted by dispersing an aqueous solution of the phospholipase, preferably as droplets with an average diameter below 10 microM. The amount of water is preferably 0.5-5% by weight in relation to the oil. An emulsifier may optionally be added. Mechanical agitation may be applied to maintain the emulsion. Agitation may be done with a high shear mixer with a tip speed above 1400 cm/s. In certain embodiments, a suitable oil degumming method comprises a) mixing an aqueous acid with an oil to obtain an acidic mixture having pH of about 1 to 4, b) mixing a base with the acidic mixture to obtain a reacted mixture having pH of about 6-9, and c) degumming the reacted mixture with a plurality of polypeptides having Phospholipase C activity and/or a composition of the present invention to obtain a degummed oil. In certain embodiments, mixing in steps a) and/or b) creates an emulsion that comprises an aqueous phase in average droplet size between about 15 microM to about 45 microM. In certain embodiments, mixing in steps a) and/or b) creates an emulsion that comprises at least about 60% of an aqueous phase by volume in droplet size between about 15 microM to about 45 microM in size, wherein percentage of the aqueous phase is based on the total volume of the aqueous phase. Any acid deemed suitable by one of skill in the art can be used in the methods provided herein. In certain embodiments, the acid is selected from the group consisting of phosphoric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, and a mixture thereof. Any acid deemed suitable by one of skill in the art can be used in the methods provided herein. In certain embodiments, the base is selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium silicate, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, and a combination thereof. In a preferred embodiment the phospholipase treatment can be conducted at a pH in the range of about 4.0 to 7.0, more preferably from 4.5 to 6.5. The pH is measured in the emulsion or in the interphase between the oil and aqueous solution. A suitable temperature is generally 30-80°C. In a preferred embodiment the temperature of the oil is between 50 and 70°C, more preferred between 55 and 65 °C and most preferred between 50 and 60°C. In other preferred embodiments the temperature of the oil is between 60 and 80°C, more preferred between 65 and 75 °C and most preferred between 67 and 72°C The reaction time will typically be 1 -12 hours (e.g., 1 -6 hours, or 1 -3 hours, most preferred the reaction time is between 1 .5 and 4 hours, even more preferred between 1.5 and 2 hours). A suitable enzyme dosage will usually be 0.1 -10 mg per liter (e.g., 0.5-5 mg per liter). The phospholipase treatment may be conducted batch wise, e.g., in a tank with stirring, or it may be continuous, e.g., a series of stirred tank reactors. The phospholipase treatment may be followed by separation of an aqueous phase and an oil phase. The separation may be performed by conventional means, e.g., centrifugation. When a liquid lipase is used, the aqueous phase will contain phospholipase, and the enzyme may be re-used to improve the process economy. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the treatment reduces the total phosphorous content of the oil to 200 ppm, preferably below 100 ppm, below 50 ppm, preferably below 40 ppm, 30 ppm, 20 ppm, 15 ppm, more preferably below 10 ppm, below 9 ppm, below 8 ppm, below 7 ppm, below 6 ppm, most preferably below 5 ppm. The compositions and processes of the invention may be used for partial hydrolysis of phospholipids, preferably lecithin, to obtain improved phospholipid emulsifiers. This application is further described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry (Publisher: VCH Weinheim (1996)), JP patent 2794574, and JP-B 6-087751 . The compositions and processes of the invention can be used to improve the filterability of an aqueous solution or slurry of carbohydrate origin by treating it with the phospholipase. This is particularly applicable to a solution of slurry containing a starch hydrolyzate, especially a wheat starch hydrolyzate, since this tends to be difficult to filter and to give cloudy filtrates. The treatment can be done in analogy with EP 219,269 (CPC International). The compositions and processes of the invention may be used in a process for the production of an animal feed which comprises mixing the phospholipase with feed substances comprising at least one phospholipid. This can be done in analogy with EP 743 017. The plurality of polypeptides having Phospholipase C activity and the compositions of the present invention may be used in combination with one or more lipolytic enzymes to convert fats and oils to fatty acid alkyl esters while achieving degumming in the same process. Such a process is for example described in US 8,012,724. The plurality of polypeptides having Phospholipase C activity and the compositions the invention may be added to and thus be used as a component of a detergent composition. The detergent composition may for example be formulated as a hand or machine laundry detergent composition including a laundry additive composition suitable for pre-treatment of stained fabrics and a rinse added fabric softener composition, or be formulated as a detergent composition for use in general household hard surface cleaning operations, or be formulated for hand or machine dishwashing operations. The plurality of polypeptides having Phospholipase C activity and the compositions of the invention may be used for production of dough and baked products from dough, as well as for production of baking compositions and baking additives. The dough generally comprises wheat meal or wheat flour and/or other types of meal, flour or starch such as corn flour, corn starch, rye meal, rye flour, oat flour, oat meal, soy flour, sorghum meal, sorghum flour, potato meal, potato flour or potato starch. The dough may be fresh, frozen or par-baked. The dough is normally leavened dough or dough to be subjected to leavening. The dough may be leavened in various ways, such as by adding chemical leavening agents, e.g., sodium bicarbonate or by adding a leaven (fermenting dough), but it is preferred to leaven the dough by adding a suitable yeast culture, such as a culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast), e.g. a commercially available strain of S. cerevisiae. The dough may also comprise other conventional dough ingredients, e.g.: proteins, such as milk powder, gluten, and soy; eggs (either whole eggs, egg yolks or egg whites); an oxidant such as ascorbic acid, potassium bromate, potassium iodate, azodicarbonamide (ADA) or ammonium persulfate; an amino acid such as L- cysteine; a sugar; a salt such as sodium chloride, calcium acetate, sodium sulfate or calcium sulfate. The dough may comprise fat (triglyceride) such as granulated fat or shortening, but the invention is particularly applicable to a dough where less than 1 % by weight of fat is added, and particularly to a dough which is made without addition of fat. The dough may further comprise an emulsifier such as mono- or diglycerides, diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- or diglycerides, sugar esters of fatty acids, polyglycerol esters of fatty acids, lactic acid esters of monoglycerides, acetic acid esters of monoglycerides, polyoxyethylene stearates, or lysolecithin. The dough may be used for any kind of baked product prepared from dough, either of a soft or a crisp character, either of a white, light or dark type. Examples are bread (in particular white, whole-meal or rye bread), typically in the form of loaves or rolls, French baguette-type bread, pita bread, tortillas, cakes, pancakes, biscuits, wafers, cookies, pie crusts, crisp bread, steamed bread, pizza and the like. The present invention is further described by the following examples that should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Examples Example 1 : P-NMR assay of purified PLC enzymes Concept The assay was conducted by incubating the PLC with a 10:1 mixture of a crude vegetable oil and aqueous citrate buffer, pH 4.0, 5.5 or 7.0. Enzyme concentration was 10 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg (mg enzyme protein (EP) per kg oil). The mixture was incubated with vigorous shaking at 50 C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was then analyzed by P-NMR. This involved an aqueous extraction step during which the phosphor species liberated by the PLC are removed from the oil phase. Hence, only lipophilic P-species were detected, i.e. unreacted phospholipid. Assay procedure The purified enzyme was diluted to 0.9 mg/mL and 0.09 mg/mL in 100 mM citrate buffer, pH 4.0, 5.5 or 7.0. The assay was initiated by adding 25 uL diluted enzyme to 250 uL crude vegetable oil in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube and incubating the mixture in a thermoshaker at 50 C for 2h. The oil used was a crude soybean oil containing a significant amount of both PA (128 ppm P), PE (141 ppm P), PI (103 ppm P) and PC (157 ppm P). For assay of mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 4 a fully refined soybean oil spiked with a mixture of PA (180 ppm P), PE (349 ppm P), PI (595 ppm P) and PC (431 ppm P) was used. NMR analysis To the oil sample was then added 0.500 mL internal standard (IS) solution, followed by 0.5 mL CDCI3 and 0.5 mL Cs-EDTA buffer. The sample was shaken for 30 s, and then centrifuged (tabletop centrifuge, 3 min, 13,400 rpm) to get phase separation. The lower phase was transferred to a NMR-tube. P-NMR was performed with 128 scans and a delay time of 5 s. Set scale reference according to IS signal (-17.75 ppm). All signals were integrated. Assignments (approx. ppm @ 25 C): 1 .7 (PA), -0.1 (PE), -0.5 (PI), -0.8 (PC). The concentration of each species was calculated as "ppm P", i.e. mg elemental P per kg oil sample. Hence, ppm P = l/l(IS) * n(IS) * M(P) / m(oil). Finally, residual phospholipid content was calculated as the ratio of enzyme treated sample vs. blank. The internal standard solution is 2 mg/mL triphenylphosphate in methanol. The Cs-EDTA buffer was prepared as: EDTA (5.85 g) is dispersed in water (approx. 50 mL). The pH was adjusted to 7.5 using 50% w/w CsOH. This gave a clear solution. Water was added up to 100 mL to give a concentration of 0.2 M EDTA. Results The tables below show residual phospholipid content in percent.

Acid/base pretreatment was done by acid addition of Ortho Phosphoric acid (85% solution) applied in amounts equal to 0.05% (100% pure Ortho Phosphoric acid) based on oil amount and mixing in ultrasonic bath (BRANSON 3510) for 5 min and incubation in rotator for 15 min followed by base neutralization with 4 M NaOH applied in equivalents (from 0.5 to 1 .5) to pure Ortho Phosphoric acid in ultrasonic bath for 5 min. The enzyme reaction was conducted in low aqueous system (3% water total based on oil amount) in 100 ml centrifuge tubes, cylindrical, conical bottom. Samples were ultrasonic treated for 5 min, followed by incubation in a heated cabinet at selected temperature (from 50 to 60°C) with stirring at 20 rpm for a selected incubation time (from 1 to 5 hours). To separate the mixture into an oil phase and a heavy water/gum phase the samples were centrifuged at 700 g at 85°C for 15 min (Koehler Instruments, K600X2 oil centrifuge). a) Diglyceride measurement The HPLC- method (using DIONEX equipment and Lichrocart Si-60, 5 μηη, Lichrosphere 250-4mm, MERCK column) was based on the principle of the AOCS Official Method Cd 1 1 d-96 and quantifies the diglyceride content down to 0.1 wt%. b) Phosphorus/phospholipid measurement The ICP-OES quantifies the phosphorus (P) content and other metals such as Ca, Mg, Zn down to 4 ppm with an accuracy of approximately ± 1 ppm P. c) Quantitative analysis of phospholipids by LCMS/MS Liquid Chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS) or coupled to quadrupole mass spectrometer time of flight (LC/TOF/MS) was used to quantify the individual phospholipids species: phosphatidylcholine (PC); Phosphatidylinositol (PI); Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and Phosphatidic acid (phosphatidate) (PA). The sensitivity of the assay goes down to less than 1 mg Phosphorus/kg oil for PC, PE and PI (ppm) and less than 10 mg Phosphorus/kg for PA. The oil sample was dissolved in chloroform. The extract was then analysed on LC-TOF-MS (or on LC-MS/MS if lower detection limits are needed) using following settings: LC-settings Eluent A: 50% Acetonitril, 50% Water, 0.15% formic acid Eluent B: 100% Isopropionic acid, 0.15% formic acid Run time: 26.9 min Flow: 0.50 mL/min Column temperature: 50°C Autosampler temp: 15-25°C Injection volume: 1 μΙ_ Column type Material: Charged Surface Hybrid, length: 50mm, size:1 ^m, ID: 2.1 mm MS-settings The data was processed using MassLynx version 4.1 Software.
