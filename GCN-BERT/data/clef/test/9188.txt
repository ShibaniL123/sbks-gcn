FIELD OF THE ART The present invention relates to ceramics having a negative and/or near-zero thermal expansion coefficient, which can be used in the manufacture of components that require a high level of dimensional stability. Therefore, the technology described in the invention falls within the new materials sector, while its application falls within the microelectronics, precision optics and aeronautical sectors. STATE OF THE ART Materials with a low thermal expansion coefficient are those wherein the volume variations associated to temperature changes are very small. Temperature-driven changes in the volume of materials is normally evaluated using the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), which is defined as the variation in volume of a material with increasing temperature and must always refer to the temperature range wherein said variation was observed. In ceramic materials, composed of a multitude of randomly oriented crystals, volume variation is usually extrapolated to linear variation. This is referred to as changes in elongation driven by temperature changes. These changes in elongation with regard to initial length driven by an increase in temperature are defined as linear thermal expansion coefficient. In general and herein, reference is made to the thermal expansion coefficient or TEC, referring to the aforementioned linear variation. When elongation value with increasing temperature is positive, we refer to positive TEC materials, while if this variation is negative we refer to negative TEC materials. Materials with a low TEC are materials wherein this variation in elongation is very close to zero. These materials therefore have a high level of dimensional stability upon temperature change, due to which they are of great interest for a wide range of applications in very diverse fields. These types of materials are, for example, required in many types of high-precision devices and instrumentation equipment in high technology systems, and in the microelectronics and precision optics industry. In all those applications wherein the dimensional stability of a precision element upon temperature change must be ensured, it will be necessary to lower the TEC of the constituent materials of those elements. The problem of the alteration in thermal expansion in elements manufactured using different materials can also be solved by means of the design of composites with a required (and homogeneous) TEC. The design of these materials with a "customised" TEC can be addressed using a combination of components with positive and negative expansion. This customised TEC design of the composites can be carried out for different temperatures, in such a manner that the final field of application of components having zero TEC will depend on whether they also achieve the rest of the specific functionality characteristics required by this application. The lithium aluminosilicate (LAS) family of ceramics and vitroceramics is frequently used for this purpose in many fields of application, from vitroceramics for kitchens to mirrors for satellites. Some mineral phases of this family have a negative TEC, which allows their use in composites with a controlled and customised TEC. Materials with a negative TEC often have low fracture resistance, as their negativity is due to a strong anisotropy between the different crystallographic orientations, wherein one of these usually exhibits negative behaviour and the other two positive behaviour. This anisotropy usually causes micro-fissures, resulting in low values in the mechanical properties of these materials. In any case, the use of these expansion properties for manufacturing composites with zero TEC has a broad range of potential applications in engineering, photonics and electronics and in other specific structural applications [R. Roy et al., Annual Review of Materials Science, 19, 59-81 (1989)]. EP 1 205 452 discloses the manufacture of a lithium aluminosilicate with near zero or negative thermal expansion coefficient. The raw material used may be lithium carbonate, silica, alumina and kaolin The LAS phase with negative expansion coefficient is β-eucryptite (LiAlSiO4), while spodumene (LiAlSi2O6) has practically zero expansion. The traditional LAS ceramic manufacturing method is based on the formation of glasses to produce vitroceramics. This method comprises the manufacture of molten material which is subsequently shaped and subjected to thermal treatment for partial crystallisation thereof [H. Bach, Low Thermal Expansion Glass Ceramics, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1995]. The ceramic products thus obtained are frequently heterogeneous. On other occasions, ceramic materials are required in the absence of or with a very low proportion of the vitreous phase, which reduces the rigidity and resistance of the ceramic products. Therefore, a method for manufacturing solid-state LAS ceramics is required which, in addition to being inexpensive, is easy to accurately adapt the final composition of the material and consequently its TEC. Sol-gel processing methods have been applied in the manufacture of LAS ceramics [W. Nan-Chung, Y. Sheng, US5320792 dated 14/06/2004] due to its multiple advantages and low processing temperatures. However, these methods are tedious, expensive and difficult to apply in industrial processes that require large amounts of material. Other methods for obtaining solid-state LAS ceramics use lithium carbonate, aluminium oxide and silicon oxide as raw materials [C. Jyh-Chen, S. Gwo-Jiun, US2004112503 dated 17/06/2004]. In this paper, reference is made to calcination for obtaining a precursor and to a thermal treatment applied subsequent to sintering. These authors highlight the difficulty of sintering these ceramics. [S.L. Swartz, US6066585 dated 23/05/2000] also makes reference to calcination for obtaining a precursor, although in this case they use an excess of lithium oxide, in comparison to the stechiometric composition of β-eucryptite (LiAlSiO4), aimed at lowering sintering temperatures and increasing mechanical resistance. This procedure causes the formation of second phases and consequently modifies the TEC values compared to monolithic β-eucryptite ceramics. In order to obtain better micro-structures and higher quality in LAS ceramics with controlled TEC values, a method including the aforementioned advantages of the sol-gel method and having industrial scalding process capacity must be developed. The method developed herein differs from other previously published methods [G. Maslennikova, Inorganic materials, 20, 9, 1984] and [A. Yamuna, et al., Journal of the American Ceramic Society, 84, 8, 2001] wherein β-eucryptite synthesis is based on the use of lithium carbonate raw materials and kaolin, as well as silica and alumina precursors such as silica sand and commercial alumina, wherein, in addition to the modification of the structure of kaolin by addition to lithium carbonate, the necessary silica and alumina for adjusting the stechiometry of the β-eucryptite being formed, is added in the form of a precursor solution, which leads to the formation of the β-eucryptite synthesis phase at much lower temperatures, with better control over the resulting phases. In this manner, an effect similar to that achieved by means of sol-gel methods is achieved, with the advantage over said sol-gel methods of being a simple, inexpensive and totally scalable process at industrial level. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based on a new process for obtaining lithium aluminosilicate-based (LAS) ceramic materials having a near-zero and negative thermal expansion coefficient within the temperature range (-150°-C to 450°-C) which comprises a preparation stage of the lithium aluminosilicate (LAS) as of kaolin, Li2CO3 and a Si02 or Al2O3 precursor solution. Although a process for preparing these materials has been published wherein kaolin and LiC03 are used in a powder mixture for preparing the LAS precursor [O.V. Kichkailo and I.A. Levitskii, Glass and Ceramics, 62, 5-6, 2005] and [A. Yamuna, et al., Journal of the American Ceramic Society, 84, 8, 2001], a process that uses a Si02 or Al2O3 precursor solution in this stage of the preparation had never been published. The use of this Si02 or A1203 precursor solution represents a novel aspect and a significant technical advantage with respect to other methods mentioned in the literature, as it is essential for obtaining β-eucryptite at a low temperature with control of the pure phases and, consequently, with a more accurately adjusted TEC. Therefore, one aspect of the present invention is the process for preparing lithium aluminosilicate-based ceramic materials having a near-zero and negative thermal expansion coefficient within the temperature range -150°-C to 450°-C, which comprises a stage for preparing the lithium aluminosilicate precursor as of kaolin, Li2CO3 and a Si02 or Al2O3 precursor solution. An aspect of the present invention is the process for obtaining ceramic materials, hereinafter referred to as the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention, characterised in that it comprises the following stages: a. synthesis of the lithium aluminosilicate precursor by means of the preparation of a kaolin suspension, Li2CO3 and a Si02 or Al2O3 precursor solution,b. calcination of the resulting powder after drying the mixture obtained in a),c. milling and drying of the material obtained in b),d. shaping of the material obtained in c),e. sintering of the material obtained in d). A more preferred aspect of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein tetraethyl orthosilicate is used as a Si02 precursor. Another more preferred aspect of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein aluminium ethoxide as an alumina precursor. Another more preferred aspect of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein the suspension of stage a) is an alcohol. Another more preferred aspect of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein the calcination of stage b) is carried out at a temperature comprised between 400°C and 970°C for a period comprised between 1 and 240 hours. Calcinations at a temperature of 900ºC transform the structure of kaolin, directly giving a β-eucryptite-type structure. Lower temperatures can be used, but using longer calcination times. The transformation of the structure of α into β in the eurocryptite normally takes place at 970ºC, due to which the calcination temperature must be greater than or equal to 970ºC in order to obtain a LAS precursor having a single β-eucryptite-type structural phase. In this process lower calcination temperatures have been achieved, obtaining the β phase as a result. A particular embodiment of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein the calcination of stage b) is carried out at a temperature of 900ºC for a period of 2 hours. Another more preferred aspect of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein the calcination of stage b) is carried out after sifting the solid obtained on drying the suspension obtained in a). Another more preferred aspect of the invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein the milling of stage c) is carried out by attrition in a high-energy mill. By means of the high-energy attrition mill, a β-eucryptite powder with a very fine grain size is obtained. This very fine grain size is essential to subsequently obtaining ceramic LAS bodies having a high relative density with enhanced mechanical properties. Another particular embodiment of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein attrition in the high-energy mill is carried out operating at 100-400 r.p.m, preferably 350 r.p.m., for periods of more than 20 minutes. Another more preferred aspect of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein the drying of stage c) is carried out by means of atomisation. Another more preferred aspect of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein the shaping of the material of stage d) is carried out by means of isostatic pressing. Another particular embodiment of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein the shaping of the material of stage d) is carried out by means of cold isostatic pressing and at pressures of between 100 and 400 MPa, preferably 200 MPa. Another more preferred aspect of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein the sintering of stage e) is carried out at a temperature of between 900ºC and 1,500ºC. Another particular embodiment of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials wherein the sintering of stage e) is carried out at a temperature of 1,350ºC. A particular example of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein a temperature ramp of 2-10ºC/min, preferably 5°C/min, is used, maintaining the final temperature for a period comprised between 1 and 4 hours, and a subsequent cooling of up to 900ºC using a temperature ramp of 2-10ºC/min, preferably 5ºC/min. Another more preferred aspect of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein stages d) and e) are carried out using the hot-press technique. The hot-press technique is based on the simultaneous application of pressure and high temperature to accelerate densification speed. In this technique, heating takes place by means of graphite resistors. Another particular embodiment of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein stages d) and e) are carried out using the hot-press technique at a temperature comprised within the range of 900-1,40ºC, preferably 1,100ºC. Another particular embodiment of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein stages d) and e) are carried out using the hot-press technique at a pressure of 5 and 80 MPa, preferably 15 MPa. Another more preferred aspect of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein stages d) and e) are carried out using the spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. The spark plasma sintering technique is also based on the simultaneous application of pressure and high temperature. As opposed to hot-pressing, this technique is based on the application of spark discharges through the graphite moulds and the sample, allowing the use of heating speeds in the order of hundreds of degrees per minute. Another particular embodiment of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein stages d) and e) are carried out using the spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique at a temperature comprised between 900ºC and 1,40ºC, preferably 1,100ºC. Another particular embodiment of the present invention is the process for preparing ceramic materials of the invention wherein stages d) and e) are carried out using the spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique, for a period of more than 1 minute, preferably 5 minutes.

The ceramic materials of the present invention have negative and/or near-zero TEC values for a broad temperature range (between -150ºC and 450ºC). The mechanical properties of the materials prepared by means of this invention are better than those of materials with negative TEC values available to date, which have values of approximately 35 MPa and E values of approximately 36 GPa [S.L. Swartz, US6066585 dated 23/05/2000].

The composition of the LAS ceramic materials of the present invention lies between spodumene and eucryptite, i.e. Li2O:Al2O3:SiO2 between 1:1:4 and 1:1:2. The main phase in the sintered material is a β-eucryptite solid solution which is stable at relatively high temperatures. Another aspect of the present invention is the use of ceramic material, prepared using any of the previously described processes, in the manufacture of new materials. Another preferred aspect of the present invention is the use of the ceramic material, prepared by means of any of the previously described processes, in the manufacture of components that require a high level of dimensional stability, such as for example high-precision measuring instruments, mirrors for space observation systems, whether terrestrial or aerial, optical lithography scanners, holography, laser instruments or heat dissipators.

EXAMPLES OF EMBODIMENT A series of trials conducted by the inventors, which are representative of the effectiveness of the process of the invention for obtaining a LAS material having a negative or near-zero thermal expansion coefficient in the temperature range of -150ºC to 450ºC, are described below. These examples are shown in figures 1 to 3. The method comprises the synthesis of a ceramic powder by means of calcination treatments prior to a high-energy milling stage essential to obtaining an improved microstructure of the final dense ceramic material. Example 1 - Synthesis of a LAS precursor having greater SiO2 content than that of the starting kaolin and subsequent densification thereof by means of sintering in a conventional oven. The synthesis of ceramic powder starts by preparing the starting materials. This implies the use of kaolin, in this example "Arcano" kaolin from Moltuval (Spain), with a composition of Al2O3.2.37SiO2.2.67H2O; lithium carbonate RECTAPUR (99%, VWR Prolabo) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich). The appropriate quantities of kaolin (528.7 g) are dispersed in 2 litres of ethanol. This dispersion is mechanically agitated at ambient temperature. The appropriate quantity of lithium carbonate (131.9 g) is then added to the dispersion, continuing agitation. Finally, the TEOS (339.4 g) is slowly added while gradually continuing agitation thereof. After mixing the raw materials, agitation is continued for 1 hour. The suspension thus obtained is dried by evaporation of the solvent, raising the temperature to 80ºC while continuing agitation. When practically all of the solvent has evaporated, the nearly dry suspension is introduced in an oven at 120ºC in order to complete drying thereof. The dry mixture is sifted prior to the calcination treatment in order to reach graining below 63 µm using a 63 µm sieve. Next, the calcination process is carried out for the formation of the LAS precursor, to which end the powder is placed in alumina crucibles which are introduced in an oven. The calcination treatment was carried out at 900ºC for 2 hours with a temperature ramp of 5ºC/min. After calcination, the starting powder is transformed into the LAS precursor. This precursor is a β-eucryptite solid solution, the composition of which is verified by means of X-ray diffraction. The next step consists of attrition of the precursor in a high-energy mill. To this end, a stable precursor suspension is prepared and introduced in the mill, dispersing the precursor powder in ethanol (40% of solid content) by mechanical agitation for 60 minutes. The attrition mill, with a 9/1 content of alumina balls, operated at 350 r.p.m. for 60 minutes. The precursor has a sub-micrometric size after milling. The suspension thus obtained is dried by atomisation at the same time that the solvent is recovered. The dry precursor is shaped by means of cold isostatic pressing at 200 MPa. This shaped material is sintered in an oven at 1,35ºC for 2 hours with a temperature ramp of 5ºC/min. Cooling is controlled up to 900ºC at the same speed. Characterisation has been carried out by means of X-ray diffraction for the purpose of controlling the resulting association of phases in the sintered material. The diffractogramme corresponding to the material obtained according to this example of embodiment is shown in figure 1. In this example, the ceramic body consists mainly of a β-eucryptite solid solution. Small traces of LiAlO2 have been detected. Small traces of vitreous phase (<2vol%) have also been detected in the images of retro-dispersed electrons obtained by scanning electron microscopy, a detailed view of which is shown in figure 2. This small percentage of glass aids sintering without affecting the mechanical properties. The sintered sample has been characterised using a Netszch DIL402C dilatometer to obtain the TEC value. The corresponding curve is shown in figure 3. The Young module was determined by means of the resonance frequency method, using a Grindosonic apparatus. Its fracture resistance was determined by conducting a four-point bend test using INSTRON 8562 testing equipment. The results of these properties are shown in Table I. Example 2 - Synthesis of a LAS precursor having a higher Al2O3 content than that of the starting kaolin and subsequent densification thereof by means of spark plasma sintering. The synthesis of ceramic powder starts by preparing the starting materials. This implies the use of kaolin, in this example "Arcano" kaolin from Moltuval (Spain), with a composition of Al2O3.2.37SiO2.2.67H2o; lithium carbonate RECTAPUR (99%, VWR Prolabo) and aluminium ethoxide (>97%, Sigma-Aldrich). The appropriate quantities of kaolin (550.3 g) are dispersed in 2 litres of ethanol. This dispersion is mechanically agitated at ambient temperature. The appropriate quantity of lithium carbonate (164.7 g) is then added to the dispersion, continuing agitation thereof. Finally, the aluminium ethoxide (111.3 g) is slowly added while gradually continuing agitation. After mixing the raw materials, agitation is continued for 1 hour. The suspension thus obtained is dried by evaporation of the solvent, raising the temperature to 80ºC while continuing agitation. When practically all of the solvent has evaporated, the nearly dry suspension is introduced in an oven at 120ºC in order to complete drying thereof. The dry mixture is sifted prior to the calcination treatment in order to reach graining below 63 µm using a 63 µm sieve.

The suspension thus obtained is dried by atomisation at the same time that the solvent is recovered. The dry precursor is introduced in a graphite mould and subjected to an initial uniaxial pressure of 5 MPa. Next, the material is sintered using the SPS technique with the following experimental variables: heating speed of 25ºC/min, maximum temperature of 1,15ºC, maximum pressure of 50 MPa, permanence time of 5 minutes at maximum temperature and pressure. Characterisation has been carried out by means of X-ray diffraction for the purpose of controlling the resulting association of phases in the sintered material.
