Steps 5 and 6: Preparation of 4-hydroxy-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one
5.83 g (20.0 mmol) of 1-(4-chloro-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)pyrimidine-5-yl)ethane-1-one prepared in step 4 and 3.57 g (30.0 mmol) of N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMF-DMA) were dissolved in 30 mL of anhydrous toluene, which was heated at 100Â° C. for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature. The solvent and DMF-DMA were eliminated under reduced pressure. The obtained intermediate compound was added with 100 mL of acetic acid and 20 mL of water, followed by reflux for 4 days. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature. The solvent was eliminated under reduced pressure. The obtained yellow product was washed with water/isopropanol (IPA) (1/1) to give 4.53 g of the target compound 4-hydroxy-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one as a white solid (16.0 mmol, yield: 80%).
