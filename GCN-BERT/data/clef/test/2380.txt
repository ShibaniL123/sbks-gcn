6-(2-chloroacetyl)-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2(1H)-one (0.50 g, 2.23 mmol), thiourea (0.178 g, 2.34 mmol) and triethylamine (0.46 mL, 3.34 mmol) suspended in anhydrous ethanol (12 ml) under argon atmosphere. The sealed tube was microwaved at 120Â° C. for 35 min. The brown precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with cold ethanol. The residue was purified by precipitating in diethyl ether and filtration to give 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2(1H)-one (0.529 g, 96%) as a light brown solid.
