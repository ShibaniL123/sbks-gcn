(1) TITLE OF THE INVENTION KAYAKING TRAINER (2} BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION In house exercising has become a. general feature of modern Me, The combination of an exercising effort with a training action enhances the value of such pursuit. Kayaking is a sport that involves a variety of bodily actions that take place at the same time that are not easily simulated. It is,, amongst others, an object of this invention to provide equipment that •extensively simulates- a kayak workout even to the extent of permitting a user to make adjustments In numerous areas In benefiting from such workout. (3) FIELD OF THE INVENTION This Invention relates to a paddling action simulating exerciser, While not so limited the exerciser finds useful application In simulating a kayak paddling action. DESCRIPTION Of PRIOR T Kayak training equipment known to the applicant often utilise a large fan to provide the workout resistance. This has the effect of rendering such equipment clumsy to transport between locations of use. A system Involving, a flywheel Is also used In providing the required resistance In simulating a kayak paddling operation. The inertia of the flywheel requires a large Initiating force at the commencement of a paddling routine; at, once running, reduces the effort thus reducing the effectiveness of the exercise. As with the fan .■utilising variation, the flywheel variation also re ires effort to mover between locations of use. (5). BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE D AW!

(6) DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE 'DRAWING' Referring to figures 1 to 3 and 9 and 11 of the drawings a paddling action simulating exerciser in the form of a kayaking trainer is generally Indicated b reference numeral 10. s The trainer 10 comprises a paddle action simulating formation in the form of a hollow open ended paddle simulating pole 12, a cord 14 that extends along the pole 12 in linearly dlsp aceabiy passing there through while its opposite end lengths 14.1 , 14.2 extend beycdd the opposite ends 18 of the pole 12, a hollow spacer 18 extending between a seating facility 20 and an anchoring layout including a. cord guiding layout 22 along which the free ends 14,3,0 14.4 of th cord 14 are secured to expansloly contractl ie resilient means in the form of a spring 24 extending within the spacer 18. The cord 14 passes against feeing damaged when subjected, to linear displacement along the pole 12. The cord 14 under conditions of linear displacement along the pole 12 generate a fr!ct!onai resistive action in the pole 12 as being formed with reduced diameter opposite ends5 In the form of fitted bushes 28, detail of one being shown in figure 5, that accommodate the free though friction generating sliding of the cord 14 along the pole 12. As thus shown in figure 5, the bushes 28 present smooth curved friction generating surfaces 28, typically in the form of anodised surfaces. While not shown the pole 12 can also be fitted with one or more Intermediate friction generating hushes. 0 The spacer 18 and seating facility 20 is fitted with elevating means in the form of an W 3 intermediate leg 30, on the one hand, and a seat elevating leg- 32 forming part of the seating facility 20s on the other hand, for elevating, the trainer 10 above a base in promoting the simulation of a kayak type paddling action. In also referring to figures 4 and 5 the end region 18,1 of the spacer 18 engages with the seating facility 20 by passing along a bore in an inner seat supporting formation 34 while socketing securely to the leg 32, Th seat 38 of the facility 20 Is formed with leading and trailing end upward slanting sections 38 to promote a comfortable seating effect. In also referring to figures 7 to 8 the trainer 10 further incorporates a footplate facility 40 for the secure and comfortable holding of the feet of an exerciser user once seated on the seating facility' 20. The facility 40 presents an upright foot abutment plate 42 fitted with heel rest 44 and a toe strap 46. As more clearly shown in figures 7 to 9 the facility 40 is muiti- dlrectiona!iy adjustable. To this effect the facility 40 Incorporates slider means by way of which the plate 42 fits slldably onto the space 18 by way of a drcymfsrentla% engaging leading and trailing sliders 48 each formed with a groove 50 along which a spacer fitted lengthwise Hey 52 engages. The trailing end slider 48 is fitted with a tightening grub 54 for securely clamping if to the spacer 18 at the desired location along the lengthwise spacing range of the facility 40 along the spacer 18. A lever 41, still show in its unclarnping condition, is used for transferring the clamping action of the grub 54 to the leading end slider 48 having the effect of Simultaneously clamping the footplate facility 40 at opposite ends onto the spacer 18. Th effect of such leading and trailing end clamping effect is to limit footplate facilit movement during use of th traine 10 that would otherwise have transpired owing to the considerable aite atshgfy left and right foot forces- sxerted the footplate 42 during a training routine. The spacer 1-8, seating facility 20, Intermediate leg 30, footplate facilit 40 and guiding layout 22 together form .-a trainer core assembly 28. in addition to permitting slidabie adjustment the foot abutment-plats 42 in being fitted with the heel rest 44 and the toe strap 48 is also verticall as well as swivelable .adjustable by way of a vertical adjustment mechanism. In referring more particularly to figure 9 the vertical adjustment mechanism involves the plate 42 being mounted to -a back face bracket 56 that is in turn secured to the slider 48 via a complementing bracket 58 extending from the slider 48 by means of a releasable attachment clamp 80. I forming the bracket abutting face with complementing undulations or ribs 82 th bracket 56 and thus the plate 42 is vertically adjustable in the direction of arrow 84 relative to the bracket 58 with the range as permitted by the complementing rib engagement. As regards s ivelable adjustment and staying with figure .9 a .swivelling adjustment mechanism involves the plate 42 being swivelably mounted to the bracket 58 about swivelling {©.cations 66 (of which the nearside one is shown). The bracket 56 is formed with arms 68 (again of which the nearside one is shown) each presenting a series of radially arranged 5 spaced apertures 70 one of which is engageable with an aperture in the bracket 68, The plate 42 Is thus swivelable in the direction of arrow 72 and bekahie at the desired slope within the range of swivelling. The extent of the paddling simulation effect as brought about by the frictions! sliding of the cord 14 along the pole 12 and supplemented by the expansible retraction of the spring 24 i o within the spacer 18 once the trainer 10 is in use is ..adjustable by wa of art adjusting mechanism involving an adjusting line 74 extending within the spacer 18· thai extends from the end of the spring 24 remote from thai to which the cord ends 14,3, 14.4 are secured. The end of the line 74 passes though the wall, of the spacer 18 i close vicinity of the seating facility 20. The end region of the line 74 beyond Its location of egress is fitted with a locking s item 76 for adjustably holding the Inner end of the spring 24 at a feed spacing in relation to the seating facility 20. An increased tensioning effect on the spring 24 as brought eboMjt by' fe retraction by way of its inner end in the direction of the seating facility 2Qi by means of the line : 74 has the overall effect of Increasing a paddling simulating effort and vice versa. The paddling action as performed a kayaking user Involves a natural sideways rocking of the 2G vessel. Such rocking effect Is also incorporated In the design of the trainer 10. In again also, referring to figures 4 and 5 and io such effect the seating facility 2Q and the intermediate leg 30 areformed with a roeRing layout In the form of an arcuate bottom, faced rocking formatio 78 associated with each of the seating facility 20 and the leg: 30 that each fits oddngiy along a flat bottomed slot 80 extending laterally to the spacer 18 and formed within slot providing 26 formations 82 respectively forming part of the seating facility 20 and the intermediate leg 30, To limit hard impaction between the leg 32 and a base 84 dunng the per orn ance of a rocking action the outer regions of the bottom edge of the leg 32 are fitted with resilient cushions 88 that come into yielding abutment with the base 84 during such rocking action. The cord guiding layout 22 comprises cord end region supplementary friction generating 30 means in the form of guide bushes 86 thai are laterally adjustably fitted to a guide carrying rod 90 i turn fitted to a guide bush elevating formation 92 fitted to the end of the spacer 18 remote from the seating facility 20. The bushes 88 perform their supplementary friction generating effects onee the trainer 10 is in use In the cord end regions 1 .3, 14.4 sliding to- and-fro there along on tensioning and retraction of the spring 24. The traine 10 includes a pole storage facilit as provided by pole accommodating notches 94 respectively formed within the leg 30 and the formation 34. in preparing for use In performing a kayak simulating exercise and also referring to figures 10 to 12 a trainer user once seated onto the seat 36 adjusts the footplate facility 40 to a comfortable setting as regards positioning along the spacer 18, vertical elevatio and slope as described above. The extent of paddle simulating effort Is also set by way of the line 74 as desirably tenslonably setting the spring 24 with the aid of the locking item 76. The extent o paddle simulating effort can however also be set during the performance of the training routine as the location of egress of the end region of the line 74 I in close vicinity of the seating facility 20. Once desirably set a kayak paddling simulating routine Is done by performing a paddling actio by way of the pole 12 that Is thus conventionally kayak paddle fashion gripped by both hands about if centre with the pots 12 at the outset extending transverse to the spacer 1¾ as shown in figures 10(a), 1 (a) and 12(a). The paddling action simulating routine is performed, in conventionally paddle action fashion moving the pole 12 as shown I figures 1.0(b), 11{b) and 12(b) simulating a paddl ng effect along one side of the assembly 28 and figures 10(c), 11 (c) and 12(c) simulating a paddling effect along the opposite side of the assembly 28, During the performance such paddling effect simulation action the cprd 12 Is caused !o linearly move to and fro along the pole 12 to accommodate the continuous variation in pole position in relation to the cord guiding layout 22. Such movement Is accompanied by a friction .effect on the movement of the cord. 12 along the bushes 2S that simulat the drag on paddle e blades as conventionally forced through wafer. During a conventional kayak paddling- action the user of the equipment does not retain a stationary upper- torso position within the equipment but also performs forward and rearward torso displacements. Similarly the user of the trainer 10 also performs forward and rearward torso displacements during a. training routine. Such displacement actions- alternating^ -cause the free end regions 14.1 , 14.2 of the cord 14 to by way of to-and-fro actions slide along the guide bushes 88 creating- a supplementary friction effect I supplementing the friction effect of the cord along the pole 12, The to~and-fro movement of the opposite sections of the cord 12 are furthermore reflected In successive expansion and contraction cycles of the spring 24 that introduce successive relaxable tensioning actions that also supplement the friction generating effects of the cord 1 along the pole 12 bushes 88, In simulating such conventional kayak paddling action the sideways rocking that Is associated wit an actual paddling action is accommodated by tre rocking layout In response to the rocking effect of the lateral rocking formations 78 In their slots 80. The overall effect of the friction In combination with the relaxab e spring, tensioning actions thus simulates the drag on paddle blades as urged along water during a conventional kayak paddling action having the overall effect Of the traine 10 being employable In a kayak paddling action simulating routine. It is. an advantage of the invention at least as specifically described that the trainer makes use of uncomplicated means In utilising the frictions! effect of a sliding cord along a pole as supplemented by the extensible contraction of a spring to simulate a paddling effect through water while also simulating the natural rocking effect found In actuai kayaking which enables trainer user to trap such person's balancing skills away from a body of water.
