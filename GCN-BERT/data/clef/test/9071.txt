Step 2. 2-(Methylsulfonyl)-1-((S)-pyrrolidin-2-yl)ethan-1-ol hydrochloride
tert-Butyl (2S)-2-(1-hydroxy-2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl)pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate (Example 87, step 1, second eluting isomer, 1.4 g, 4.8 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL), and then HCl (4 N in 1,4-dioxane, 5.96 mL, 23.9 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature before concentrating the mixture under reduced pressure to afford the title compound (1.08 g, 99% yield) as an off-white solid.
