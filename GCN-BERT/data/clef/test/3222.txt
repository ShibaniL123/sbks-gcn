Step 2. tert-Butyl (4-cyanobicyclo[2.1.1]hexan-1-yl)carbamate
tert-Butyl (4-carbamoylbicyclo[2.1.1]hexan-1-yl)carbamate (290 mg, 1.21 mmol) in DCM (20 mL) containing triethylamine (1.35 mL, 9.65 mmol) at 0° C. was treated with trichloroacetyl chloride (0.54 mL, 4.8 mmol). After 40 minutes, the reaction was quenched with saturated NaHCO3 at 0° C. and the aqueous mixture was extracted with DCM. The organic extract was dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated, and the residue was purified by flash chromatography (eluting with a gradient from 0-20% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford product as a white solid (230 mg, 86%). LCMS for C12H19N2O2 (M+H)+: calculated m/z=223.1, found 223.1.
