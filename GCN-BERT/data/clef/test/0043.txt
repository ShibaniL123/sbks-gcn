FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to orthotic devices. In a particular form, the present invention relates to an orthotic device for stretching tissue within the neck of a patient. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Chiropractors have for many years studied the biomechanics of the spine and the adverse effects of reduced motion in the. joints of the spine. A person's physical movement can become restricted when soft tissue structures alter, most commonly due to contraction of the soft tissue structures. These soft tissue structures comprise, amongst other things, ligaments, joint capsules, muscles and tendons. Prolonged poor posture or trauma can create stresses that effect normal motion of the spine. These stresses can encourage structural changes, altering the spine's optimal functional position. This can result is inefficient biomechanics and a decrease in the movement in the joints of the spine. When structural changes occur in the spine, the surrounding soft tissue structures can also change due to their altered position. This altered position of the spine and surrounding soft tissue structures exacerbates poor movement, encouraging the spinal joints further away from optimal functioning. In the cervical spine, this process is evident when the normal lordotic position is decreased. This can be visualised via diagnostic imaging using an X-ray analysis. One proposed solution has comprised a neck support for promoting a structural positional change in the spine. This neck support comprises two rigid wall portions meeting at an apex forming a generally triangular shape. In operation, the patient lies on the flat surface with their neck contacting the apex of the neck support such their head is suspended above the surface. However, there. are problems associated with this form of neck support. To achieve a structural positional change in the spine, the wall portions are made from a rigid plastic and extend at an angle of approximately seventy degrees relative to the surface, applying an excessive tractional force on the ligaments of the neck when in use. This excessive force applied to the neck can cause significant discomfort to the patient. Furthermore, due to the sharp angle which the wall portions meet at the apex, global over-extension of the neck can occur due to the small surface area in contact with the neck, leading to further discomfort for the user. Moreover, the apex of the neck support can only contact upper portions of the neck because the wall portions cannot be placed lower down due to the angle of the wall portions. This can be unsuitable for particular patients requiring stretching of the lower portion of the neck. The present invention seeks to ameliorate at least some of the above mentioned problems. Furthermore, the present invention seeks to provide an orthotic device which in use is more comfortable for the patient. Additionally, the present invention seeks to provide an orthotic device which in use can stretch various portions of the neck, rather than achieve a structural positional change in the spine.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIGS. 1 to 3 show an example of an orthotic device 10 according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. The orthotic device 10 comprises a body 20 comprising a base 30 and a first support surface 40. In use, the first support surface 40 supports a selected region of a patient's neck 70 whilst suspending the patient's head 80. The first support surface 40 acts as a positional fulcrum such as to gently bend the patient's neck 70 over the first support surface 40 whilst suspending the patient's head 80 above a substrate surface 130. In one form, the orthotic device 10 comprises a second support surface 50 for supporting either a region of the patient's neck located lower than the selected region 70 supported by the first support surface 40 or the patient's shoulders 90 such as to restrict cervical over-extension. Spacing between an apex 60 of the first support surface 40 and the base 30 is greater than spacing between the second support surface 50 and the base 30. The first support surface 40 is in the form of a first convex surface 100 and the second support surface 50 is in the form of a first concave surface 110. The first convex surface 100 and the first concave surface 110 are shaped to support the curvature of a patient's neck 70, head 80 and shoulders 90. The first convex surface 100 comprises a degree of curvature which is less than the degree of curvature of the first concave surface 10. In this form the first convex surface 100 tangentially meets the first concave surface 110 to provide a gradual curvature of the support surfaces. This tangential meeting of the convex support surface 100 and the concave support surface 110 allows the first support surface 40 to be placed at selected regions of the patient's neck 80. As clearly shown in the side view of the orthotic device 10 in FIG. 2, the first convex surface 100 is part of a bulbous portion of the body 20 and the first concave surface 110 is part of a recess in the body 20. In one form the bulbous portion is substantially a half cylindrical protrusion extending from the body 20 and the recess is substantially a quarter cylindrical recess in the body. As illustrated by the dotted lines in FIG. 2, the half cylindrical protrusion comprises radius 123 greater than a radius 126 of the quarter cylindrical recess where the degree of curvature of the quarter cylindrical recess is greater than the degree of curvature of the half cylindrical protrusion. In one form, the orthotic device 10 comprises side faces 120 extending from the base 30 to the first support surface 40 and second support surface 50. At least one side face 120 tangentially meets with the first convex surface 100. At least one side face 120 is substantially vertical in a normal position and wherein the base 30 is orthogonal to the at least one side face 120. Additionally, the base 30 comprises a substantially elongate planar surface such as to provide a stable support surface to rest on a substrate surface 130 which the patient lies upon in use. In use, the surface area of the first support surface 40 in contact. with the patient is less than the surface area of the elongate planar surface in contact with substrate surface. As shown clearly in the side view of FIG. 2, the first convex surface 100 tangentially meets at least one of the side faces 120. This tangential meeting between the first convex surface 100 and the adjacent side face 120 allows for the patient's head to be supported whilst being suspended, restricting cervical over-extension. By attempting to restrict cervical over-extension, an increase in movement of the patient's neck 70 within optimal limits can be obtained and additionally improve the functional relationship between soft tissue structures and the joints in the spine. Furthermore, by providing a large contact surface in the form of a bulbous portion of the body 20, cervical over-extension is further reduced. The first support surface 40 may be made from a cushioning material. Alternatively the first and second support surface 40, 50 may be made from cushioning material or substantially the entire orthotic device 10 may made from a cushioning material. The cushioning material may be resilient. In use, the orthotic device 10 resiliently compresses such that the weight of the patient's neck 70, head 80 and shoulders 90 are supported. This configuration alleviates neck soreness caused by more rigid material used in prior art devices. Additionally, due to the bulbous portion of the orthotic device 10, the patient's head 80 is slightly lifted from the substrate surface 130 whilst the patient lies in a supine position, suspending the patient's head 80 from the substrate surface 130 and applying a gentle stretch to the patient's neck 70 and spine. The cushioning material can resiliently compress between 5% to 35% when supporting the selected region of the patient's neck 70. Preferably, the cushioning material compresses between 10% to 25% when supporting the selected region of the patient's neck. In one form, the resiliently cushioned material can take the form of synthetic foam. The synthetic foam may be in the form of closed cell cross-linked polyethylene foam. Another example of the orthotic device 135 is shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. FIG. 4 shows a perspective view of the orthotic device 135 and FIG. 5 shows a side view of the orthotic device 135. The orthotic device 135 comprises a third support surface 140 adjacent the first contact surface 40 for supporting the back of the patient's head 80. The third support surface 140 forms a generally higher positional fulcrum point at the first convex surface 100. The third support surface 140 comprises a second convex surface 150 and a second concave surface 160. The second concave surface 160 is located adjacent the first convex surface 100, and the second concave surface 160 is located adjacent the second convex surface 150. The side faces 120 extend from the base to the first 40, second 50 and third support surfaces 140. When the patient's neck 70 is supported by the first support surface 40 and third support surface 140, a gap between the first convex surface 100 and the second convex surface 150 leaves a portion of the patient's neck 80 failing to be in contact with the orthotic device 135 such as to focus the stretching applied to the patient's neck 80 in contact with the first support surface 40. The second convex surface 150 tangentially meets the second concave surface 160. This provides a gradual curved surface for supporting the back of the patient's head 80. An apex 155 of the second convex surface 150 tangentially meets the second concave surface 160. In this form, spacing between the apex 155 of second convex surface 150 and the base 30 is less than spacing between the first convex surface 100 and the base 30 such as to suspend the patient's head 70 above the substrate surface 130. The degree of curvature of second convex surface 150 in this form is greater than the degree of curvature of the first convex surface 100. Additionally, the degree of curvature of the second concave surface 160 is greater than the degree of curvature of the first convex surface 100, the second convex surface 150 and the first concave surface 110.
