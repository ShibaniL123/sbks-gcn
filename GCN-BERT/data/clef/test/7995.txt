Technical Field The present invention relates to an agomelatine hydrobromide hydrate and preparation and use thereof, and to pharmaceutical composition containing it. Technical Background Agomelatine, or N-[2-(7-methoxy-1-naphthyl)ethyl]-acetamide, has the structure of formula II. It is marketed under the trade name of Valdoxan by the French company Servier as a melatonin agonist and antagonist of 5HT2C receptor. It is the first melatonin type anti-depressant, indicated for depression, improving sleep and sexual function. In view of its pharmaceutical value, it is important to produce the compound or a complex thereof with better purity, solubility and reproducibility. Summary of the Invention The object of the present invention is to provide an agomelatine hydrobromide hydrate featuring excellent solubility, stability and purity, making it favourable for use in the manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations containing agomelatine. CN101481321 describes agomelatine.HX complexes obtained through anhydrous conditions. Those complexes of the prior art were found unstable in high temperature conditions and accelerated denaturing conditions. When the present inventors attempted to purify agomelatine product, we surprisingly found that agomelatine can form a physically and chemically stable agomelatine hydrobromide hydrate when mixed with hydrobromic acid (HBr). Said agomelatine hydrobromide hydrate is suitable for the manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations. When other conventional inorganic acids (such as sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, perchloric acid) or organic acids (such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid) were used, it was not easy to produce a hydrate or hydrates with unstable physical and chemical properties were obtained. The present invention provides an agomelatine hydrobromide hydrate with the following structure of formula I: wherein X is Br. The present invention further provides a method for the preparation of said agomelatine hydrobromide hydrate. There can be two processes: agomelatine can be dissolved in aqueous organic solvent before HBr gas is bubbled through and the precipitated crystal is rinsed and dried; or agomelatine can be added to an solvent containing HBr and then the precipitated crystal is rinsed and dried. The results from repeated experiments show that in the first method, the oversupply of HBr only results in lower yield, while in the second method, it is easier to control the amount of HBr in the solvent. Therefore, the second method is preferred. Specifically, agomelatine can also be added to an aqueous organic solvent before a solvent containing HBr is added dropwise, and the precipitated crystal is rinsed and dried. Alternatively, agomelatine is dissolved in organic solvent before aqueous HBr solution is added dropwise, and the precipitated crystal is rinsed and dried. The reaction temperature in the present invention can be conventional temperatures for such reactions in the art as long as it is lower than the boiling point of the solvent. In order to increase yield, room temperature or below is preferred, a temperature below the room temperature is more preferred, and 0-20°C is most preferred. In the above-mentioned preparation method for said agomelatine hydrobromide hydrate, the organic solvent is not specifically limited so long as it can dissolve the starting materials agomelatine and HBr and meanwhile allows said agomelatine hydrobromide hydrate to be precipitated. Suitable solvent can be used includes ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, acetone, acetonitrile and the like, and ethyl acetate is preferred. Organic solvents with higher polarity such as alcohols (ethanol and methanol etc.), DMF, DMSO are less preferred. The present invention is advantageous in that the inventors found that among so many conventional acids, agomelatine can react with HBr to form a stable agomelatine hydrobromide hydrate, the physical properties of which, such as stability, solubility, and hygroscopicity, are better than those products of agomelatine with any other conventional acid. The process is also less complicated than if other acid is used. The agomelatine hydrobromide hydrate produced according to the present method has significantly increased solubility than agomelatine per se, and therefore is more suitable for manufacturing pharmaceutical formulations. The product enjoys higher stability, purity and solubility. In addition, product with high purity can be obtained through a simple process, free of any complicated steps. Pharmacological tests of the agomelatine hydrobromide hydrate demonstrated that it can be used for the treatment of melatoninergic system disorders, sleep disorders, stress, anxiety, seasonal affective disorder, major depression, cardiovascular diseases, digestive system diseases, insomnia and fatigue caused by jet lag, schizophrenia, phobia or depression disorders. The present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition, comprising an agomelatine hydrobromide hydrate of the invention in associated with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants or excipients. The pharmaceutical composition can be formulated for various routes of administration, especially for oral administration or for injection. The useful dosage can be adjusted depending on the nature and severity of the diseases to be treated, the mode of administration, and age and weight of the patients. The daily dosage varies from 0.1 mg to 1 g and may be administrated in a single dose or in several divided doses.
