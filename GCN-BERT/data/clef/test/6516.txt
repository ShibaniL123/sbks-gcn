PRIORITY CLAIM This application is filed under 35 U.S.C. §111(a) and is a continuation pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §120 of PCT Application Number PCT/US2011/045179 published as WO 2012/018580 A1 and filed on Jul. 25, 2011, which in turn claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/367,380 filed Jul. 24, 2010. The foregoing applications are incorporated by reference in their entirety as if fully set forth herein. BACKGROUND Restaurants, institutional kitchens, and other commercial or high-volume food service locations have a need to wash dish and glassware very rapidly. For decades, the most common solution has been a commercial dishwasher, typically incorporating a conveyor belt upon which large racks containing dirty dish and glassware pass through the washing compartment of the commercial dishwasher. The dish and glassware racks have varied interior configurations, capable of carrying dishes, glasses, and tableware, among other items that are run through the commercial dishwasher for washing. The exterior configuration of the racks is generally the same, however. A dish or glassware rack for use with a commercial dishwasher is typically 19.72″×19.72″ square. Although the height may vary to accommodate small dishes to tall glasses, the lateral profile of racks used with commercial dishwashers is nearly always the same. Further, racks for use in commercial dishwashers are nearly always stackable, such that dishes and glasses can be vertically stacked for compact storage within the racks. A groove formed in the bottom face of the square rack permits it to be placed on top of another rack, with the top rail of the bottom rack mating with the groove in the bottom face of the top rack. In many racks, the top rail includes locator posts, which are upward-facing protrusions which make the interlock between a bottom rack and a rack stacked above the bottom rack more secure. One important functional aspect of commercial dish and glassware racks is that they have openings in the bottom of the rack and on all four side walls. This allows water to spray through the bottom or side walls of the rack during washing and reach all surfaces of the dishes or glassware contained within the rack. It is simple to understand that if water could not penetrate the bottom and side surfaces of the rack, efficient cleaning of the dish or glassware would be impossible. The corollary effect, however, is that the water can drip back through the bottom of the rack. An additional function of the openings in the bottom and sides of the rack is to permit drip-drying of the dish and glassware following its run through the commercial dishwasher. While some conveyor-belt dishwashers have a drying section, many restaurants and other kitchens opt for a commercial dishwasher that is limited to washing and does not include drying capability. Such wash-only dishwashers are less expensive, less complex, and take up less room in the kitchen than one which includes a drying section. An issue with the use of a wash-only commercial dishwasher, however, is that during drying, the water drips straight through the bottom of the rack and onto the floor, pooling on the floor and possibly creating a safety hazard or other undesirable effect. When multiple dish and/or glassware racks are stacked following their run through the dishwasher, the water from all the racks drips onto the floor. Glasses, particularly, are loaded into a commercial glassware rack upside-down, to facilitate drip-drying. The risk of an employee slipping on the pools of water created when the water drips through the racks onto the floor is high, especially when one considers the tile or other smooth-surface floors often used in the kitchen. Also, on occasion, an employee will carry a rack loaded with dishes or glassware. The holes in the rack will permit the water to drip through the rack onto the employee's clothing, which is undesirable. Further, when the racks are loaded with dirty dishes or glassware and then transported to the dishwasher, food remnants, unfinished drinks, and other detritus may pass through the bottom of the racks and onto the floor. In addition to the safety hazard described above, germs become an additional concern. In some restaurants or other kitchens, following washing, the dish or glassware is transported to a storage location. This transport is often facilitated by the use of a dolly. The dolly provides a frame with wheels attached underneath the frame, where the frame is sized to receive a standard commercial dish or glassware rack. A number of racks may be stacked on the dolly, and then the stack of racks may be rolled to where the dishes or glasses are stored. Some dollies have a handle for pushing the stack of racks once loaded onto the dolly. Dollies are also used to transport racks of dirty dishes or glassware. Most of these dollies have a frame that is open in the center. While some dollies have a closed bottom, that is uncommon. The more likely scenario when clean or dirty dishes and glasses are transported in a dolly is that water or other substances pass right through the bottom of the racks, through the frame of the dolly and onto the floor over which the dolly is being pushed. Rather than just a single pool of water, use of a dolly with an open frame can lead to potentially hazardous spills all over the establishment, including areas of a restaurant where patrons may walk. What is needed is an apparatus for preventing water or other substances that spill out of the bottom of a commercial dish or glassware rack from passing onto the floor below. As will be further described below, the present disclosure provides a basin with a solid base and solid sides that is sized and configured to permit interlocking with commercial dish or glassware racks which could be placed on the floor at the bottom of a stack of racks, or at the bottom of a dolly, permitting drips from the racks stacked above the basin to be caught by the basin. Further, placing a basin underneath the stack of racks would elevate the clean dish and glassware further from the floor. A beneficial increase in workplace safety and sanitation is a likely result of use of such a device. Accordingly, this application discloses a basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks. FIELD OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE The present disclosure relates generally to commercial dishwashers, and more specifically, to a basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks. SUMMARY The present disclosure relates generally to commercial dishwashers, and more specifically, to a basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks. In some embodiments, a basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks may include a four-sided base and a plurality of sides or side walls peripheral to the base. In some embodiments, the base is a square base, having four corners of approximately ninety degrees each. In some embodiments, a side is defined by an inner panel and an outer panel, the inner and outer panels being associated with a top rail of the basin, where pairs of adjoining sides form a corner. In some embodiments a corner is a rounded corner. In some embodiments, a basin for use with a commercial dish and glassware rack has area dimensions defined as the area disposed between the plurality of outer panels of approximately 19.72″ by 19.72″. In some embodiments, a basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks has a base having a top surface of the base and a bottom surface of the base. The top surface forms a floor of the basin, with the plurality of inner panels of the basin completing the interior of the basin. In some embodiments, the interior assemblies of the basin are solid, preventing the passage of water or other substances through the interior of the basin. In some embodiments of a basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks, each pair of an inner panel and an outer panel are panels which are upwardly inclined towards one another. In some embodiments, each pair of an inner panel and an outer panel are panels that define a space within the panels. In such an embodiment, one or more basins or commercial dish and glassware racks can be stacked and removably interlocked, such that a top rail of a commercial dish or glassware rack or a top rail of a basin can fit inside the space defined by the inner panel and outer panel. In such an embodiment, the space defined by the inner panel and outer panel receives the top rail of a basin or the top rail of a commercial dish or glassware rack, such that the commercial dish or glassware rack is “stacked” upon the basin in a removably interlocked fashion. In such an embodiment, the upward inclination of the inner panel and outer panel towards one another limits the penetration of a rack that is stacked below the basin into the space defined by basin the inner panel and outer panel of the basin. In some embodiments, if a commercial dish or glassware rack is stacked on the basin and said commercial dish or glassware rack contains dishes or glassware that are wet or otherwise contaminated with liquids or other substances, drips containing water or other substances are caught by the basin. In some embodiments, a basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks includes a plurality of indentations, such as circular indentations, in the top surface of the base of the basin. Such indentations trap water or other substances which have dripped from a commercial dish or glassware rack that is stacked above the basin. The indentations are compartment-like indentations that prevent water or other substances from freely flowing around the basin. The indentations trap liquids in a more contained fashion than a basin without such indentations. In some embodiments, a basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks includes one or more handle sections. In some embodiments, a basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks includes one or more locator posts projecting upwardly from the top rail. A locator post is designed to be received by a portion of a channel of the bottom surface of a basin, or to be received by a portion of a channel of the bottom surface of a commercial dish and glassware rack. In some embodiments, the locator posts are curved locator posts, where the curve follows the curve of rounded corners of the basin. In a further embodiment, a basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks is fabricated of heat-stable co-polymer plastic.

Of note is the plurality of openings in the side of the glassware rack 100, designed to permit water to pass into and out of the glassware rack. The base of the rack also has a plurality of openings designed to permit water to pass into and out of the glassware rack 100. FIG. 2 is a depiction of the prior art, in this case, a perspective view of glassware being loaded into the glassware rack 100 as shown in FIG. 1 for use with a commercial dishwasher. The glassware rack 100 can have glasses 126 placed into the network area 122 through the top of the glassware rack 100. Of note is that the glassware is loaded upside-down, so that water penetrating the rack from the washing mechanism of the commercial dishwasher below the rack can enter the glassware for cleaning. Also, the upside-down orientation permits water or other substances to drip out of the upside-down glassware. FIG. 3 is a depiction of the prior art, in this case, a cutaway lateral view of the glassware rack 100 as shown in FIG. 1 with glassware loaded therein. As shown in FIG. 3, the glassware rack 100 may include a base 102, a plurality of inner panels one of which is at 106; a plurality of outer panels one of which is at 108; a channel 128; a plurality of limiting spacers one of which is at 130, the limiting spacers each having a bottom edge 132. Of note is that the glassware rack 100 may have a channel 128 in the bottom surface of the base that is formed by the interior surface of the inner panel 106 (interior here meaning interior to the channel), the interior surface of the outer panel 108 (interior here meaning interior to the channel), and the plurality of bottom edges 132 of the limiting spacers 130. The channel 128 is disposed adjacent to the outer panel 108 of each of the four sides peripheral to the base 102 and is adapted for receiving at least a portion of a top rail 110 of another commercial dish and glassware rack 100. The inner panel 106 and outer panel 108 of each of the four sides define a space with a plurality of limiting spacers 130 positioned therein. The plurality of limiting spacers 130 are positioned to limit the penetration of at least a portion of a top rail 110 of another commercial dish and glassware rack 100 during stacking. FIG. 4 is a depiction of the prior art, in this case, an exploded perspective view of glassware being loaded into the glassware rack 100 of FIG. 1, wherein the glassware rack 100 is interlockably stackable with another glassware rack 100 for use with a commercial dishwasher. FIG. 5 is a depiction of the prior art, in this case, a cutaway lateral view of an embodiment of a stack of glassware racks 100 for use with a commercial dishwasher, the racks having been loaded with glassware, the glassware dripping water or other substances through the bottom of the racks, the water or other substances being dripped directly onto the floor. The base 102 of the glassware rack 100 depicted in FIG. 5 has a plurality of openings, similar to the plurality of openings 120 in the plurality of sides 104 in the rack 100 shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 5 specifically depicts that water 134 or other substances including unconsumed beverages can drip from the inside of the glasses 126 through the holes in the base 102 onto the floor 136 or other surface on which the rack 100 or stacked racks rest. The resulting puddle creates a safety hazard for employees or others working near the stack of racks 100. FIG. 6 is a depiction of the prior art, in this case, a perspective view of an embodiment of a dolly 200 for use in transporting a stack of commercial dish or glassware racks 100 for use with a commercial dishwasher. Dollies for transporting a stack or commercial dish or glassware racks and their use are well understood in the art. The dolly 200 may include a frame 202; a lip 204, a plurality of wheels, one of which is at 206, and a handle 208. The frame 202 and lip 204 are configured and dimensioned to removably receive a commercial dish or glassware rack. In one embodiment, the inside dimensions of the frame 202 are just large enough to accommodate a 19.72″ by 19.72″ rack, while the lip 204 provides the surface on which the rack rests. Of note in FIG. 6 is that the dolly 200 has an open frame. It will be recognized by one with skill in the art that a dolly such as the dolly 200 illustrated in FIG. 6, when loaded with racks full of wet dish and glassware, will permit drips from the wet dish and glassware to pass directly through the rack onto the surface below on which the dolly is being rolled. FIG. 7 is a depiction of the prior art, in this case, a perspective view of glassware being loaded into the glassware rack 100 of FIG. 1, the glassware rack 100 being interlockably stackable with another glassware rack to form a stack of glassware racks, the stack being loaded on the dolly 200 of FIG. 6. FIG. 8 is a depiction of the prior art, in this case, a perspective view of a stack of glassware racks 100 for use with a commercial dishwasher, the stack of racks having been placed on the dolly 200, the racks having been loaded with glassware, the glassware dripping water or other substances through the bottom of the racks and through the frame of the dolly, the water or other substances being dripped directly onto the floor. FIG. 8 specifically illustrates the water 134 passing through the frame 202. The water 134 can come to rest on a floor or other surface on which the dolly 200 is being rolled over or resting, creating a spill hazard for employees or patrons who may walk in the path of the dolly 200. FIGS. 9, 10, and 11 are respectively a perspective view, a side view, and a top view of a basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, and as best shown in FIGS. 9 and 11, the basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks may include a four-sided base 302 and a plurality of sides or side walls peripheral to the base, one of which is shown at 304. In some embodiments, the base is a square base, having four corners of approximately ninety degrees each. In some embodiments, a side 304 is defined by an inner panel 306 and an outer panel 308, the inner and outer panels being associated with a top rail 310 of the basin 300, where pairs of adjoining sides form a corner one of which is depicted at 312. In some embodiments, a corner 312 is a rounded corner 312. In some embodiments, a basin 300 for use with a commercial dish and glassware rack has area dimensions defined as the area disposed between the plurality of outer panels 308 of approximately 19.72″ by 19.72″. In different embodiments, a basin 300 for use with a commercial dish and glassware rack is not a square basin. In different embodiments, a basin 300 for use with a commercial dish and glassware rack has different lengths or widths, the length or width ranging from 2 inches to 144 inches. In some embodiments, a basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks has a base 302 having a top surface 324 of the base and a bottom surface (not depicted in FIG. 9, 10 or 11) of the base. The top surface 324 forms a floor of the basin 300, with the plurality of inner panels 306 of the basin 300 completing the interior of the basin 300. In some embodiments, the interior assemblies of the basin 300 are solid, preventing the passage of water or other substances through the interior of the basin 300. In some embodiments of the basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks, each pair of an inner panel 306 and an outer panel 308 are panels which are upwardly inclined towards one another. In some embodiments, each pair of an inner panel 306 and an outer panel 308 are panels that define a space within the panels. In such an embodiment, one or more basins 300 or commercial dish and glassware racks can be stacked and removably interlocked, such that a top rail of a commercial dish or glassware rack or a top rail 310 of the basin 300 can fit inside the space defined by the inner panel 306 and outer panel 308. In such an embodiment, the space defined by the inner panel 306 and outer panel 308 receives the top rail 310 of the basin 300 or the top rail of a commercial dish or glassware rack, such that the commercial dish or glassware rack is “stacked” upon the basin 300 in a removably interlocked fashion. In such an embodiment, the upward inclination of the inner panel 306 and outer panel 308 towards one another limits the penetration of a rack that is stacked below the basin 300 into the space defined by the inner panel 306 and outer panel 308 of the basin 300. In some embodiments, if a commercial dish or glassware rack is stacked on the basin 300 and the commercial dish or glassware rack contains dishes or glassware that are wet or otherwise contaminated with liquids or other substances, drips containing water or other substances are caught by the basin 300. In some embodiments, the basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks includes a plurality of indentations 320 in the top surface 324 of the base 302 of the basin 300. In one embodiment, the indentations 320 are circular. Such circular indentations 320 trap water or other substances which have dripped from a commercial dish or glassware rack that is stacked above the basin 300. The circular indentations 320 are compartment-like indentations that prevent water or other substances from freely flowing around the basin 300. The circular indentations 320 trap liquids in a more contained fashion than a basin without such indentations. In some embodiments, the basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks includes one or more handle sections, one of which is depicted at 314. In some embodiments, the basin 300 may have a handle section 314 only on two opposing sides 304, or may have a handle section on all four sides. A handle section 314 includes a small ridge 316 “cut out” of an outer panel 308 with which the handle section 314 is associated. A handle section includes a gripping area 318 intended to be gripped by one who carries the basin 300. In some embodiments, the basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks includes one or more locator posts projecting upwardly from the top rail 310, one of which is located at 322. A locator post 322 is designed to be received by a portion of a channel of the bottom surface of the basin 300, or be received by a portion of a channel of the bottom surface of a commercial dish and glassware rack. It will be recognized by one skilled in the art that locator posts 322, which are generally upward protrusions from a top rail 310, may vary in size, shape, or location on the top rail. In some embodiments, locator posts 322 projecting upwardly from the top rail are L-shaped. In a further embodiment, the L-shaped locator posts project upwardly from the top rail at the four corners. In another embodiment, the locator posts 322 are curved locator posts 322, where the curve follows the curve of rounded corners 312 of the basin 300. In some embodiments, locator posts 322 may be non-uniform or nonsymmetrical in appearance. In some embodiments, locator posts 322 may have functional shapes that limit the stackability of one or more basins 300 or dish and glassware racks to a particular rotation. In one embodiment, the basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks is fabricated of plastic. In a further embodiment, the basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks is fabricated of heat-stable plastic. In a further embodiment, the basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks is fabricated of heat-stable co-polymer plastic. Such plastics and their selection are well known to those skilled in the art. It will be appreciated by those with skill in the art that the terms “basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks,” as used in the instant application including in the preamble to the claims, does not limit the function of the apparatus to being a basin, nor does it limit its use to accompany commercial dish or glassware racks. Use of the term “basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks” in any claim preambles is not intended to give life, meaning, or vitality to the claims. FIG. 12 is a bottom view of the basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. FIG. 13 is a partial perspective cutaway of the basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks may include a base 302, the base having a bottom surface 326 of the base 302; a plurality of sides one of which is at 304, the sides 304 being defined by a plurality of inner panels one of which is at 306 and a plurality of outer panels one of which is at 308; a plurality of corners one of which is at 312; a plurality of handle sections, one of which is at 314 (not shown in FIG. 13), the handle sections 314 each having a gripping area at 318; a channel 328; a plurality of limiting spacers, one of which is at 330, the limiting spacers 330 each having a bottom edge of a limiting spacer, one of which is at 332; a plurality of short limiting spacers one of which is at 334, the short limiting spacers 334 each having a bottom edge of a short limiting spacer, one of which is at 336; and a square indentation area 338. In some embodiments, the basin 300 includes a channel 328, which is disposed adjacent to the interior side of the outer panel 308, the channel 328 completely circumscribing the base 302 of the basin 300. In some embodiments, a channel 328 is defined by a space within the inner panel 306 and the outer panel 308. In a further embodiment, the channel 328 defined by the space within the inner panel 306 and the outer panel 308 is further defined by a plurality of limiting spacers 330 disposed between the inner panel 306 and the outer panel 308. The limiting spacers 330 do not extend to the bottom of the base 302, and the difference between the bottom of the base 302 and the bottom of the limiting spacers 330 defines the limit of penetration of at least a portion of a top rail 310 of another basin 300 or a commercial dish and glassware rack stacked underneath the basin 300. In a further embodiment, the channel 328 is further defined by a plurality of short limiting spacers 334 disposed between the inner panel 306 and the outer panel 308. In such embodiments, when a different basin 300 or a commercial dish or glassware rack is stacked with the first basin 300, the short limiting spacers 334 are configured to receive a locator post 322 of a basin 300 or a locator post of a commercial dish or glassware rack. It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that a basin 300 having locator posts 322 located in the corners 312 of the basin 300 is stacked underneath a different basin 300, the short limiting spacers 334 nearest the corners 312 of the basin 300 will engage the locator posts 322. In some embodiments, the bottom surface 326 of a base 302 of a basin 300 has a square indentation 338. In such embodiments, when a dish or glassware rack holding dishes or glassware is stacked underneath a basin 300, with the dishes or glassware extending above the top rail of the dish or glassware rack below the basin 300, a square indentation 338 can accommodate at least a portion of the dishes or glassware such that the dishes or glassware in the rack stacked underneath the basin 300 do not touch the bottom surface 326 of the basin 300. FIG. 14 is a partial lateral cutaway view of a basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, a basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks has a channel 328, the channel 328 being defined by a portion of the outer panel 308, the inner panel 306, the plurality of limiting spacers 330, and the plurality of short limiting spacers 334. In a certain embodiment, the channel 328 is configured to receive the top rail 310 of another basin 300, the other basin 300 being represented in dashed lines in FIG. 14. The channel 328 can also receive the top rail of a commercial dish and glassware rack. In some embodiments, the channel 328 receiving the top rail 310 facilitates the stacking of a plurality of basins 300, or a stack including a plurality of basins 300 and/or a plurality of commercial dish and glassware racks. In some embodiments, the channel 328 limits the penetration into the base of the basin 300 by the top rail of another basin 300 or the top rail of another other rack. The top rail 310 of the lower basin 300 or other rack engages the bottom edge of the limiting spacers 332, limiting the penetration. Further, for basins 300 or racks with locator posts 322 protruding upwardly from the top rail 310, the locator posts 322 of the lower basin 300 or rack will engage the bottom edge of the short limiting spacers 336 of the upper basin 300, further limiting the penetration. Further, the locator posts 322, when received by the channel 328 and engaging the bottom edge of the short limiting spacers 336 and the interior portion of the inner panel 306 of the upper basin 300, will serve to further limit the lateral travel of the plurality of racks or basins 300 with respect to one another, creating a more secure interlock when the locating posts 322 are part of the embodiment. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many combinations of limiting spacers, short limiting spacers, top rails, and locator posts protruding upwardly from the top rail are possible, thus changing the degree of penetration of a lower basin 300 or rack into the base of an upper basin 300 or rack. Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that such combinations can also limit stacking of basins 300 or racks to certain orientations, for example, such that when a rack is rotated 90 degrees the penetration (and thus, the height difference between the top surfaces of the bases of the racks) is varied. FIGS. 15 and 16 are perspective views of a basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, a commercial dish or glassware rack 100 is stacked on top of a basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks. In a certain embodiment, the top rail 310 (not seen in FIG. 16) of the basin 300 is received by a channel in the commercial dish or glassware rack 100, the channel being common to all commercial dish or glassware racks as described herein. In some embodiments, a plurality of commercial dish or glassware racks 100 is stacked above a basin 300. In a further embodiment, glasses 126 are loaded upside-down into the exemplary glassware rack 100. Should the glasses 126 be wet or contain other substances due to either being washed without drying, or containing unconsumed beverages, any drips from the glasses 126 will drip into the basin 300, preventing the spillage of the water or other substances onto the surface below the glassware rack 100. Further, carrying a rack 100 with a basin 300 underneath will ensure drips will not drip onto the clothing of the person carrying the rack. Further, when use of the basin 300 has ended, the basin 300 can quickly be cleaned by rinsing it with water, or even by running it upside-down through the commercial dishwasher. In another embodiment, a basin 300 is stacked on top of another basin 300. Such stacking of a plurality of basins 300 could be desirable for storage of the basins, or for creating a stack of basins 300 on top of which a commercial dish or glassware rack 100 is stacked, to raise the height of the commercial dish or glassware rack 100 for easy loading or unloading. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are many uses for a basin 300 beyond catching drips from dishes or glassware that are not dry. FIGS. 17 and 18 are lateral cutaway views of a basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, when a plurality of dish and glassware racks 100 are stacked on top of a basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks, water drips 134 or other substances from the dishes and glassware in the racks 100 drip through the holes in the base of the rack 102 into the basin 300. The water 134 or other substances having dripped from the glasses 126 or other items in the racks 100 is contained by the basin 300, being accumulated on the top surface 324 of the base 302 of the basin. In some embodiments, a plurality of basins 300 and commercial dish and glassware racks 100 are stacked together, alternating a basin 300 with a plurality of racks 100. In this embodiment, water 134 dripping from racks 100 is spread among multiple basins 300. FIGS. 19 and 20 are perspective views of a basin for use with commercial dish and glassware racks, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, a basin 300 for use with commercial dish and glassware racks is received by a dolly 200. In a further embodiment, one or more commercial dish and glassware racks 100 are stacked above the basin 300. In such an embodiment, racks 100 holding dishes or glassware that is wet or to which remnants of food or drinks or other substances are adhered can be safely transported by the dolly 200 without fear that the water or other substances will drip through the racks 100 and dolly 200 onto the surface over which the dolly 200 is being pushed. Water or other substances may drip from the racks 100, but it will be contained by the basin 300 that has been placed in the dolly 200 at the bottom of the stack of racks 100. While preferred and alternative embodiments of the present disclosure have been illustrated and described, as noted above, many changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the present disclosure is not limited by the disclosure of these preferred and alternate embodiments. Instead, the invention should be determined entirely by reference to the claims that follow. 1.
