FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a solid cosmetic product, a process for producing said product, and a product prepared by the method. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION The present invention relates to products particularly those for use in contact with the human body. A cosmetic product which has been increasingly popular is massage bars. These products contain a solidified oil or fat moulded into a product which may be held easily in the hand. Alternatively a larger sized product may be made from which a small piece may be broken and then used. In use, the massage bar is applied to the skin of the recipient either as a complete bar or by breaking off a small piece of product which is then applied to the skin. These solid products are both popular for home use and for application by a professional masseur. Products are known where some or all of the massage bar product is formed from fats having a relatively high solid fat content. If correctly manufactured, these fats which are firm and solid at room temperature will melt on contact with skin. However, such melting may require prolonged contact with skin. During this period of prolonged contact, the user being massaged is subject to the unpleasant feeling of hard fat in a solid form being applied to the skin. In view of the above disadvantages in the use of hard massage bars, many users find it desirable to buy massage bars which melt easily and which are immediately soft to the touch and on the skin. This could of course be provided with by formulation of a massage bar containing a high proportion of soft fats with relatively low melting points. However such formulations would be difficult to deliver without the use of packaging. Packaging is to be avoided for reasons of cost but most importantly for the protection of the environment. The present invention seeks to provide a solid cosmetic product which may be used as a massage bar and which allows for immediate contact with the skin without the user being massaged with hard solid fat which takes a significant period to melt when contacted with the skin. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In a first aspect, there is provided a solid cosmetic composition comprising (i) an outer layer comprising (a) a hard vegetable butter in an amount of 10 to 45 wt. % based on the outer layer, and(b) a soft vegetable butter in an amount of 55 to 80 wt. % based on the outer layer; and (ii) an inner core which is (a) a soft vegetable butter composition;(b) a fondant; or(c) a liquid cosmetic. In a second aspect, there is provided a process for the production of a solid cosmetic composition comprising an outer layer and an inner core, wherein the outer layer and the inner core are distinct from each other and the outer layer envelops the inner core, the process comprising the steps of: i) preparing an outer layer, wherein outer layer composition comprises (a) a hard vegetable butter in an amount of 10 to 45 wt. % based on the outer layer, and(b) a soft vegetable butter in an amount of 55 to 80 wt. % based on the outer layer; (ii) preparing an inner core which is (a) a soft vegetable butter composition;(b) a fondant; or(c) a liquid cosmetic iii) enveloping the inner core with the outer layer. In a third aspect, there is provided a product obtained or obtainable by a process as described herein. In a fourth aspect, there is provided a cosmetic method comprising contacting the skin of a user with a solid cosmetic composition as described herein. For ease of reference, these and further aspects of the present invention are now discussed under appropriate section headings. However, the teachings under each section are not necessarily limited to each particular section. ADVANTAGES If we have identified that by providing a solid cosmetic composition as described herein, a composition is prepared which holds its form and does not may be readily melt prior to use. By virtue of this property, it is possible to sell the product without unnecessary packaging. The solid cosmetic composition of the present invention may also be applied to skin and the selected combination of vegetable butters allow for the composition to readily melt on application to the skin. Thus by this selection of vegetable butters, on application to the skin the user is not subjected to the unpleasant feeling of a hard and as yet and melted butter being applied. The high proportion of “soft” butters contained in the first vegetable butter composition means that the cosmetic composition may be applied in a number of manners. The solid cosmetic composition may be contacted directly with the skin. The user alternatively may squeeze the entire product such that the first vegetable butter composition and the inner core are intermixed prior to use. The inner core may contain a selection of softer materials or may contain fragrance or other desirable materials. Thus by this squeezing and mixing of the outer layer and the inner core a desirable sensory effect is provided. In yet a further alternative the solid cosmetic composition may be broken into parts by the user. The correct amount of product may be selected by the user, for example to apply a single massage treatment, and the remainder of the product may be retained. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Composition As discussed herein, in one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a solid cosmetic composition comprising (i) an outer layer comprising (a) a hard vegetable butter in an amount of 10 to 45 wt. % based on the outer layer, and(b) a soft vegetable butter in an amount of 55 to 80 wt. % based on the outer layer; and (ii) an inner core which is (a) a soft vegetable butter composition;(b) a fondant; or(c) a liquid cosmetic. It will be understood by one skilled in the art that the nature of a cosmetic product means that the product is not edible. Thus in a further aspect the present invention provides a non-edible solid cosmetic composition comprising (i) an outer layer comprising (a) a hard vegetable butter in an amount of 10 to 45 wt. % based on the outer layer, and(b) a soft vegetable butter in an amount of 55 to 80 wt. % based on the outer layer; and (ii) an inner core which is (a) a soft vegetable butter composition;(b) a fondant; or(c) a liquid cosmetic. The solid products of the present invention are compositions which can substantially sustain their physical shape when unsupported by external means, e.g. packaging etc. Thus, they are considered to be solid, solid like, in solid form or in solid-like form at room temperature. For the avoidance of doubt the solid product must remain substantially solid at up to 30° C. By solid-like, it is understood that some materials are considered on a day to day basis to be solid, yet over an extremely long period of time, may alter in shape, e.g. amorphous materials such as glass etc. However, they are considered to be solid-like as, for the purpose they fulfil, they are solid. Due to the solid form of the compositions of the present invention, external packaging is not required to maintain the shape of the composition. The vegetable butters used in the present invention are triglycerides which is found to be solid (including solid like, discussed above) at normal usage temperatures. For the avoidance of doubt the vegetable butter is a triglyceride which remains substantially solid at up to 30° C. It will be appreciated however that it is not a requirement that the vegetable butter have a solid fat content of 100% at normal usage temperatures. In a preferred aspect the solid fat has a solid fat content of at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, preferably at least 95%, preferably at least 98%, preferably at least 99% at 25° C. The present invention provides a cosmetic product which is solid. The vegetable butters incorporated into the solid product are typically used as agents in massage.
