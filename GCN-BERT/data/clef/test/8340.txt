Example 5
In a nitrogen atmosphere, N-cyclopentyl-2-methoxy-5-(N,N-dimethyl-formamido)-3-pyrrylformonitrile (II) (2.6 g, 10 mmol), N-[5-(1-piperazino)-2-piperidyl] guanidine (III) (4.4 g, 20 mmol) and dimethylbenzene 15 mL were added in a reaction bottle, were heated to 120Â° C., and were subjected to stirring reaction for 20-24 hours to finish TLC detection reaction. A solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure, and was cooled to room temperature, methanol was added, and solid was separated out. The solid was filtered, a filter cake was washed twice with cold methanol, and was dried under vacuum to obtain off-white solid ribociclib (I) 3.05 g, and the yield was 70.3%; and EI-MS m/z: 435 [M+H]+,
