Preparation of compound 21-j.
Compound 21-k (1.1 g, 4.06 mmol) and anhydrous magnesium chloride (110 mg) were mixed and the mixture was heated to 190Â°C and reacted for 3 hours, then the mixture was cooled to room temperature and added with ethyl acetate (50 mL), a solid was precipitated. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 10: 1) to deliver a white solid 21-j (1.1 g, yield: 100%).
