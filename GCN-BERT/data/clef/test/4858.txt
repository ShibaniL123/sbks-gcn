Compound 84A (800 mg, 2.99 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml of thionyl chloride, and then DMF (65.56 mg, 897.00 µmol) was added thereto. The reaction solution was heated to 120 °C for 2.5 hours, and then concentrated and purified by column chromatography to give a compound 84B (500 mg, the yield was 58.45%) as an orange solid.
