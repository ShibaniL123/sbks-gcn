(5) Preparation of 2-(4-benzyloxybutyl)pyridine
60% sodium hydride (0.47 g, 11.8 mmol) and dry tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) were put into a 200-mL flask, and stirred in a nitrogen atmosphere. In a water bath, a dry tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) solution of 2-pyridine-butanol (1.50 g, 9.92 mmol) was dropwise added thereto at 25° C. or lower, taking 5 minutes, and then stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes. The reactor was again put in a water bath, and a dry tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) solution of benzyl chloride (1.51 g, 11.9 mmol) was dropwise added thereto at 25° C. or lower, taking 15 minutes, and stirred overnight at room temperature.
Cold water (5 mL) was added to the reaction liquid for quenching, and this was extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL). The resultant organic layer was washed with 20% saline water (30 mL), dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated to give a crude product (2.54 g). This was purified through silica gel chromatography to give 1.04 g (yield 43.4%, purity 98.5%) 2-(4-benzyloxybutyl)pyridine (invention product 1).
