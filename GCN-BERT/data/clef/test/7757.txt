Step 3 Synthesis of Compound I-210
To Compound 137 (45 mg, 85 µmol) in tetrahydrofuran (450 µL) and methanol (450 µL) solution was added 4 mol/L lithium hydroxide aqueous solution (450 µL, 1.8 mmol), the mixture was stirred at 80°C for 3 hours. 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid was added thereto, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography to obtain Compound I-210 (1 mg, 2.3% yield) as a yellow solid.
