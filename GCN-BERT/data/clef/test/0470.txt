TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to polyamide resins and processes for molding them, specifically polyamide resins having high heat resistance and excellent mechanical properties and processes for molding them. BACKGROUND ART Polyamide resins are widely used as engineering plastics having excellent mechanical strength such as impact resistance and friction/abrasion resistance as well as excellent heat resistance and oil resistance in the fields of automotive parts, electronic/electric equipment parts, office automation equipment parts, machine parts, construction materials/housing parts and the like, and recently have found increasingly wide applications. Many classes of polyamide resins including e.g., polyamide 6 and polyamide 66 are known, among which m-xylylene adipamide (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "MXD6") derived from m-xylylenediamine and adipic acid is positioned as a very excellent polyamide resin because it contains an aromatic ring in the main chain unlike polyamide 6 and polyamide 66 so that it has high rigidity, low water absorption and excellent oil resistance as well as a low shrinkage ratio during molding and causes little shrinkage or warp, which means that it is also suitable for precision molding. Thus, MXD6 has recently been more widely used as a molding material, especially extrusion molding material in various fields including electronic/electric equipment parts, parts of vehicles such as automobiles, general machine parts, precision machine parts, leisure/sports goods, civil engineering and construction materials, etc. On the other hand, there have recently been increasingly growing commercial needs in applications requiring high heat resistance, such as reflectors in LED illumination and LED mounting boards, which require high heat resistance during manufacturing or use thereof. Patent documents 1 to 4 propose to use various polyamide resin compositions for these applications. Patent document 1 discloses a composition comprising a semiaromatic polyamide composed of terephthalic acid and 1,9-nonanediamine and 2-methyl-1,8-octanediamine in combination with titanium oxide, magnesium hydroxide and a filler. This polyamide shows a high melting point around 306 °C, for example, but undesirably has problems such as difficulty in molding and low productivity because of poor melt flowability, susceptibility of the resin to decomposition and high gas emission and the like. In such applications requiring high heat resistance, polyamide resins having ameltingpoint of 280 °C or more, especially higher than 300°C are desired, but polyamide resins having not only such a high melting point but also excellent moldability have not actually reached an industrially satisfactory level at present. Polyamide resins are also described in EP 2 130 853 A2, EP 2 327 737 A1, and EP 2 505 597 A1.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION Under the foregoing circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide a polyamide resin that has high heat resistance and that is less susceptible to decomposition and excellent in moldability and mechanical properties. MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS As a result of careful studies to attain the above object, we accomplished the present invention on the basis of the finding that polyamide resins comprising a diamine component containing p-xylylenediamine as a major constituent combined with m-xylylenediamine and a dicarboxylic acid component containing adipic acid as a maj or constituent optionally combined with straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as sebacic acid and having a specific molecular weight and melting point wherein the molar ratio of the diamine component to the dicarboxylic acid component reacted is equal to or below a specific value fulfill the above object. Thus, a first aspect of the present invention provides a polyamide resin comprising a diamine unit containing 70 mol % or more of a xylylenediamine unit and a dicarboxylic acid unit containing 70 mol % or more of a straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acid unit, wherein the xylylenediamine unit is composed of 55 to 95 mol % of p-xylylenediamine and 45 to 5 mol % of m-xylylenediamine; the straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acid unit is composed of 50 to 100 mol % of adipic acid and 0 to less than 50 mol % of sebacic acid or other straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids; the molar ratio of reacted diamine units to reacted dicarboxylic acid units (the number of moles of reacted diamine units / the number of moles of reacted dicarboxylic acid units) is less than 0.994; and the polyamide resin has a number average molecular weight of 10, 000 to 25,000 and a melting point of 285 °C or more. A second aspect of the present invention provides the polyamide resin according to the first aspect, which has a terminal amino group concentration of 10 to 100 µeq/g. A third aspect of the present invention provides the polyamide resin according to the first aspect, which has a terminal carboxyl group concentration of 50 to 200 µeq/g. A fourth aspect of the present invention provides the polyamide resin according to the first aspect, wherein the ratio of the terminal amino group concentration to the terminal carboxyl group concentration ([NH2]/[COOH]) is 0.6 or less. A fifth aspect of the present invention provides the polyamide resin according to the first aspect, which has a melting point of higher than 300 °C. A sixth aspect of the present invention provides a heat-resistant part obtained by molding the polyamide resin according to the first aspect. A seventh aspect of the present invention provides the heat-resistant part according to the sixth aspect, which is a reflector for LED, an LED mounting board or a heat sink element. An eighth aspect of the present invention provides a process for molding a polyamide resin as defined in any one of the first to fifth aspects, wherein the process comprises melt-molding the polyamide resin in an extruder or molding machine to subject the polyamide resin to further amidation reaction. A ninth aspect of the present invention provides the process for molding a polyamide resin according to the eighth aspect, wherein the number average molecular weight of the polyamide resin after melt molding increases by 0.5 to 50 % relative to the number average molecular weight before melt molding. ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, polyamide resins that have high heat resistance and that are less susceptible to decomposition and excellent in moldability and mechanical properties can be consistently provided. Further, the polyamide resins of the present invention can be converted into polyamide resin moldings having excellent heat resistance and mechanical properties by a molding process involving melt molding for further amidation reaction in an extruder or a molding machine to increase the molecular weight. Molded articles obtained by molding the polyamide resins of the present invention are expected for use in the fields of highly heat-resistant parts to which polyamide resins could not be applied so far, including, for example, reflectors for LED, LED mounting boards or heat sink elements. The reason why such characteristics as resistance to decomposition are provided may be attributed to the fact that the polyamide resins of the present invention are prevented from heat-induced decomposition during molding by selecting a low ratio of the number of moles of the diamine component / the number of moles of the dicarboxylic acid component of less than 0.994 to contain terminal carboxyl groups in excess of terminal amino groups in contrast to conventional polyamide resins consisting of a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid that are synthesized by polymerizing the diamine component and the dicarboxylic acid component in around 1:1 to increase the molecular weight. Also, it is thought that highly heat-resistant moldings having excellent mechanical properties such as flexural strength can be obtained because amidation reaction further proceeds in amoldingmachine to increase the molecular weight. THE BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The polyamide resins of the present invention are polyamide resins comprising a diamine unit containing 70 mol % or more of a xylylenediamine unit and a dicarboxylic acid unit containing 70 mol % or more of a straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acid unit, characterized in that: the xylylenediamine unit is composed of 55 to 95 mol % of p-xylylenediamine and 45 to 5 mol % of m-xylylenediamine;the straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acid unit is composed of 50 to 100 mol % of adipic acid and 0 to less than 50 mol % of sebacic acid or other straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids;the molar ratio of reacted diamine units to reacted dicarboxylic acid units (the number of moles of reacted diamine units / the number of moles of reacted dicarboxylic acid units) is less than 0.994; andthey have a number average molecular weight of 10,000 to 25,000 and a melting point of 285 °C or more. The polyamide resins of the present invention and the processes for molding the polyamide resins will now be explained in detail below. As used herein, the term "to" means to include the values indicated before and after it as lower and upper limits unless otherwise specified. The diamine unit of the polyamide resins of the present invention is derived from a diamine component containing 70 mol % or more of xylylenediamine and the xylylenediamine is composed of 55 to 95 mol % of p-xylylenediamine and 45 to 5 mol % of m-xylylenediamine. If the xylylenediamine is less than 70 mol %, heat resistance and chemical resistance decrease. The xylylenediamine is preferably 80 mol %, more preferably 90 mol %, even more preferably 95 mol %, especially 98 mol %. If p-xylylenediamine is less than 50 mol % (i.e., m-xylylenediamine is more than 50 mol %) in the xylylenediamine, heat resistance and crystallinity decrease, but if it exceeds 95 mol % (i.e., m-xylylenediamine is less than 5 mol %), moldability deteriorates. The dicarboxylic acid unit of the polyamide resins of the present invention is derived from a dicarboxylic acid component containing 70 mol % or more of a straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acid and the straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acid is composed of 50 to 100 mol % of adipic acid and 0 to less than 50 mol % of sebacic acid or other straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids. If the proportions are in these ranges, polyamide resins having good heat resistance and high moldability can be obtained. Preferred dicarboxylic acids for use as straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids other than adipic acid and sebacic acid are straight chain aliphatic α,ω-dicarboxylic acids containing 4 to 20 carbon atoms, e.g., aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as succinic acid, glutaric acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, undecanoic diacid, dodecanoic diacid and the like, and they can be used alone or as a mixture of two or more of them. Preferred proportions of straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids consist of 55 to 100 mol % of adipic acid, 45 to 0 mol % of sebacic acid and less than 50 mol % to 0 mol % of other straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids. Examples of diamines other than p-xylylenediamine and m-xylylenediamine that can be used in the range of less than 30 mol % of diamines as starting diamines of the polyamide resins may include aliphatic diamines such as tetramethylenediamine, pentamethylenediamine, 2-methylpentanediamine, hexamethylenediamine, heptamethylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, nonamethylenediamine, decamethylenediamine, dodecamethylenediamine, 2,2,4-trimethylhexamethylenediamine and 2,4,4-trimethylhexamethylenediamine; alicyclic diamines such as 1,3-bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexane, 1,4-bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexane, 1,3-diaminocyclohexane, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, bis(4-aminocyclohexyl)methane, 2,2-bis(4-aminocyclohexyl)propane, bis(aminomethyl)decane (including structural isomers thereof) and bis(aminomethyl)tricyclodecane (including structural isomers thereof); diamines having an aromatic ring such as bis(4-aminophenyl)ether, p-phenylenediamine, p-xylylenediamine and bis(aminomethyl)naphthalene (including structural isomers thereof) and the like; and they can be used alone or as a mixture of two or more of them. When a diamine other than p-xylylenediamine and m-xylylenediamine is used as a starting diamine, it should be used at a proportion of less than 30 mol %, preferably 1 to 25 mol %, especially preferably 5 to 20 mol % of the diamine structural unit. Examples of dicarboxylic acids other than straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids that can be used in the range of less than 30 mol % of dicarboxylic acids include phthalic acid compounds such as isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid and orthophthalic acid; isomeric naphthalenedicarboxylic acids such as 1,2-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 1,3-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 1,5-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 1,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 1,7-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 1,8-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 2,3-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid and 2,7-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid and the like; and they can be used alone or as a mixture of two or more of them. Monocarboxylic acids such as benzoic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid; polycarboxylic acids such as trimellitic acid and pyromellitic acid; carboxylic anhydrides such as trimellitic anhydride and pyromellitic anhydride and the like can also be used. A preferred dicarboxylic acid for use as a dicarboxylic acid other than straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids is isophthalic acid because of moldability. The proportion of isophthalic acid is less than 30 mol %, preferably 1 to 25 mol %, especially preferably 5 to 20 mol % of the dicarboxylic acid structural unit. The polyamide resins of the present invention preferably have a terminal amino group concentration of 10 to 100 µeq/g, more preferably 15 to 70 µeq/g, even more preferably 20 to 50 µeq/g and preferably have a terminal carboxyl group concentration of 50 to 200 µeq/g, more preferably 60 to 170 µeq/g, even more preferably 70 to 150 µeq/g. By controlling the terminal amino group concentration and terminal carboxyl group concentration in the above ranges, the polyamide resins tend to show a molecular weight in a suitable range, better mechanical properties, and resistance to decomposition and decreased gas emission during molding, thereby improving moldability. The ratio of the terminal amino group concentration to the terminal carboxyl group concentration ([NH2] / [COOH]) is preferably 0.7 or less, more preferably 0.6 or less, especially preferably 0.5 or less. Polyamide resins with this ratio of greater than 0.6 tend to be poor in heat resistance and susceptible to discoloration or gas emission during molding. The terminal amino group concentration can be determined by dissolving 0.5 g of a polyamide resin in 30 ml of a phenol/methanol (4:1) mixed solution with stirring at 20 to 30 °C and titrating the solution with 0.01 N hydrochloric acid. Similarly, the terminal carboxyl group concentration can be calculated as follows: 0.1 g of a polyamide resin is dissolved in 30 ml of benzyl alcohol at 200 °C and 0.1 ml of a phenol red solution is added in the range of 160 °C to 165 °C. This solution is titrated with a titration solution of 0.132 g of KOH in 200 ml of benzyl alcohol (0.01 mol/l expressed as KOH content) until the endpoint is reached at which the color changes from yellow to red completely. The polyamide resins of the present invention have a melting point of 285°C or more, preferably 290°C or more, more preferably 295°C or more, even more preferably 300 °C or more, especially preferably 305 °C or more. The upper limit is preferably about 340 °C, more preferably 335 °C or less, even more preferably 330 °C or less, especially 320 °C or less. By selecting the melting point in the above ranges, heat resistance improves. The glass transition point of the polyamide resins is preferably in the range of 60 °C to 120 °C, more preferably 65 °C to 110 °C, especially 70 °C to 100 °C. As usedherein, the melting point and glass transition point of a polyamide resin refer to the melting point and glass transition point that can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) by melting a sample by heating it once to eliminate the influence of thermal history on crystallinity and then heating it again. Specifically, a polyamide resin sample is melted by heating from 30 °C to a temperature equal to or higher than an expected melting point at a rate of 10 °C/min, and then rapidly cooled. Then, the sample is heated at a rate of 10 °C/min to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point, whereby the melting point and glass transition point can be determined. The polyamide resins of the present invention also have a number average molecular weight of 10, 000 to 25, 000, preferably 11, 000 to 24, 000, even more preferably 12, 000 to 23, 000. When it is in such ranges, the resulting moldings have good mechanical strength and moldability improves. The number average molecular weight here is calculated from the terminal amino group concentration [NH2] (µeq/g) and the terminal carboxyl group concentration [COOH] (µeq/g) of a polyamide resin by the equation below: Number average molecular weight=2,000,000/COOH+NH2. The polyamide resins of the present invention have a molar ratio of reacted diamine units to reacted dicarboxylic acid units (the number of moles of reacted diamine units / the number of moles of reacted dicarboxylic acid units; hereinafter sometimes referred to as "reaction molar ratio") of less than 0.994, preferably less than 0.993, more preferably less than 0.992, especially less than 0.991, and the lower limit is preferably 0.970 or more, more preferably 0.975 or more, even more preferably 0.980 or more, especially 0.985 or more. By controlling the reaction molar ratio at less than 0.994, the polyamide resins of the present invention resist decomposition of the resins during molding and have consistent flowability. This also helps amidation reaction to proceed in an optimal range but not excessively during melt molding for further amidation reaction in an extruder or a molding machine. If the molar ratio is 0.994 or more, resins may readily decompose to emit gas during molding. The reaction molar ratio (r) here is determined by the equation below: r=1-cN-b⁢C-N/1-cC+a⁢C-N wherein: a: M1/2b: M2/2c: 18.015 (the molecular weight of water)M1: the molecular weight of the diamine (g/mol)M2: the molecular weight of the dicarboxylic acid (g/mol)N: terminal amino group concentration (eq/g)C: terminal carboxyl group concentration (eq/g). It should be understood that when a polyamide resin is synthesized from diamine and dicarboxylic acid monomers having different molecular weights, M1 and M2 are calculated depending on the proportions (molar ratio) of the starting monomers. It should also be understood that if the synthesis vessel is a completely closed system, the molar ratio of loaded monomers equals the reaction molar ratio, but the inlet molar ratio does not always equal the reaction molar ratio because the actual synthesizer cannot be a completely closed system. Moreover, the inlet molar ratio does not always equal the reaction molar ratio because loaded monomers may not completely react. Thus, the reaction molar ratio refers to the molar ratio of actually reacted monomers determined from the terminal group concentrations of a finished polyamide resin. The reaction molar ratio of the polyamide resins can also be controlled by appropriately selecting reaction conditions such as the inlet molar ratio of starting dicarboxylic acid and diamine, reaction period, reaction temperature, the speed at which xylylenediamine is added dropwise, the degree of vacuum in the vessel, the timing of starting depressurization and the like. When the polyamide resins are prepared by the so-called salt process, a reaction molar ratio of less than 0.994 may be achieved specifically by selecting a ratio of a starting diamine / a starting dicarboxylic acid of less than 0.994 and allowing the reaction to proceed sufficiently far, for example. In the case of a process involving continuous dropwise addition of a diamine to a molten dicarboxylic acid, it may be achieved by not only selecting a loading ratio of less than 0.994 but also controlling the amount of the diamine to be refluxed during the dropwise addition of the diamine and removing the added diamine outside the reaction system. Specifically, the diamine may be removed outside the system by controlling the temperature in the reflux column in an optimal range or appropriately controlling the shapes and amounts of packings in the packed column such as so-called Raschig rings, Lessing rings and saddles. Alternatively, unreacted diamine can also be removed outside the system by shortening the reaction period after dropwise addition of the diamine. Further, unreacted diamine can also be removed outside the system as appropriate by controlling the speed at which the diamine is added dropwise. These methods allow the reaction molar ratio to be controlled in a predetermined range even if the loading ratio is higher than 0.994. The polyamide resins of the present invention are obtained by polycondensing a diamine component containing 70 mol % or more of xylylenediamine and a dicarboxylic acid component containing 70 mol % or more of adipic acid, sebacic acid or other straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids and they are prepared by using any of previously known processes and polymerization conditions including, but not specifically limited to, atmospheric pressure melt polymerization, high pressure melt polymerization and the like. For example, they are prepared by heating a polyamide salt composed of p-xylylenediamine, m-xylylenediamine and adipic acid (and optionally sebacic acid and the like) in the presence of water under pressure to polymerize it in the molten state while removing the water added and condensed water. They may also be prepared by directly adding p-xylylenediamine and m-xylylenediamine to adipic acid (and optionally sebacic acid and the like) in the molten state to polycondense them at atmospheric pressure. In the latter case, polycondensation proceeds by continuously adding p-xylylenediamine and m-xylylenediamine while heating the reaction system to a reaction temperature equal to or higher than the melting points of the oligoamide and polyamide produced to prevent the reaction system from solidifying. When the polyamide resins are to be obtained by polycondensation, lactams such as ε-caprolactam, ω-laurolactam and ω-enantolactam; amino acids such as 6-aminocaproic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 11-aminoundecanoic acid, 12-aminododecanoic acid, 9-aminononanoic acid and p-aminomethylbenzoic acid and the like may be added to the polycondensation reaction system so far as the performance is not affected. In the present invention, the polyamide resins described above can be converted into highly heat-resistant moldings having excellent mechanical properties such as flexural strength with an increased molecular weight by melt-molding them in an extruder or a molding machine to allow amidation reaction to further proceed. The melt molding process is not specifically limited. For example, resin pellets can be prepared from a polyamide resin of the present invention by further melt-kneading a dry blend optionally mixed with other ingredients. Especially, melt kneading is preferably performed by using various conventional extruders such as single or twin-screw extruders, especially preferably twin-screw extruders because of productivity, versatility and the like. In this case, melt kneading is preferably performed under controlled conditions at a temperature of 290 to 340 °C for a residence time of 10 min or less by using a screw having at least one or more, preferably two or more reverse helix screw elements and/or kneading discs on which the polyamide resin partially stays. When the polyamide resins are prepared into molded articles of various shapes by various conventional molding processes such as e.g., injection molding, injection compression molding, hollow molding, extrusion molding, sheet molding and the like, amidation reaction can also be allowed to proceed by melt kneading. By these molding processes, the molecular weight increases so that highly heat-resistant molded articles having excellent mechanical properties such as flexural strength can be obtained. Preferably, the molding temperature is 290 to 340 °C and the residence time is 10 min or less during these processes. By controlling the temperature during melt kneading by an extruder and the molding temperature during molding in the above ranges, the amidation reaction of the polyamide resins is promoted so that the amidation reaction yield increases and the molecular weight tends to increase. This improves mechanical properties of molded articles prepared from the polyamide resins. By selecting a screw and an extrusion temperature in the above ranges, insufficient kneading by an extruder or decomposition of the resins is less likely to occur so that the polyamide resins tend to be prevented from degradation and discoloration. The amidation reaction yield of the polyamide resins before melt molding, i.e. the polyamide resins after polymerization is preferably 0.985 to 0.998, more preferably 0.990 to 0.997. The amidation reaction yield after melt molding is preferably 0.986 to 0.998. If one attempts to achieve an amidation reaction yield of 0.998 or more in polymerization, the polyamide resin will undergo an excessive thermal history during polymerization, with the undesirable result that the polyamide resin may be deteriorated by the heat applied to the polyamide resin during the subsequent molding process or the polyamide resin may be discolored during polymerization. By controlling the amidation reaction yield in such ranges, polyamide resins having good moldability with less gas emission during molding can be obtained. As used herein, the amidation reaction yield (P) refers to the ratio of reacted monomers and can be calculated from the reaction molar ratio, the number average molecular weight and the molecular weights of water and monomers in cases of polyamide resins composed of a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid, and specifically it can be calculated by the equation below: Amidation reaction yieldP=Mn+r⁢Mn-M⁢1-M⁢2/2⁢r⁢Mn-c wherein: Mn: number average molecular weightr: reaction molar ratioc: 18.015 (the molecular weight of water)M1: the molecular weight of the diamine (g/mol)M2: the molecular weight of the dicarboxylic acid (g/mol). The number average molecular weight of the polyamide resins after melt molding preferably increases by 0.5 to 50 % relative to the number average molecular weight before melt molding. The increase rate of a molecular weight is defined as the increase rate (%) of the number average molecular weight after molding relative to the number average molecular weight before molding, more preferably 1 to 40 %, even more preferably 3 to 30%, especially 5 to 20 %. Molded articles obtained by using the polyamide resins of the present invention include various moldings such as films, sheets, laminated films, laminated sheets, tubes, hoses, pipes, profile extrusions, hollow containers, bottles, fibers, parts of various shapes and the like. Molded articles obtained by using the polyamide resins of the present invention can be used as parts for various applications requiring heat resistance including electric/electronic equipment parts, parts of vehicles such as automobiles, general machine parts, precision machine parts and the like, especially they can be conveniently used as reflectors for LED, LED mounting boards or heat sink elements or the like. The polyamide resins of the present invention may contain a phosphorus compound to improve processing stability during melt molding or to prevent the polyamide resins from discoloration. Phosphorus compounds containing an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal are conveniently used, including for example phosphate salts, hypophosphite salts and phosphite salts of sodium, magnesium, calcium and the like. Among them, hypophosphite salts of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals are preferably contained because they are especially useful for preventing the polyamide resins from discoloration. When a phosphorus compound is used, it is desirably contained in a polyamide resin at 1 ppm or more and 200 ppm or less, preferably 5 ppm or more and 160 ppm or less, even more preferably 10 ppm or more and 100 ppm or less expressed as the phosphorus atom concentration in the polyamide resin finally obtained. In addition to the phosphorus compounds described above, the polyamide resins of the present invention may further contain various materials including, but not limited to, additives such as lubricants, matting agents, heat stabilizers, weather stabilizers, UV absorbers, nucleating agents, plasticizers, flame retardants, antistatic agents, discoloration inhibitors, anti-gelling agents and the like so far as the benefits of the present invention are not affected. The polyamide resins of the present invention preferably contain a carbodiimide compound. Carbodiimide compounds preferably include aromatic, aliphatic or alicyclic polycarbodiimide compounds prepared by various processes. Among them, aliphatic or alicyclic polycarbodiimide compounds are preferred in terms of melt kneadability during extrusion or the like, and alicyclic polycarbodiimide compounds are more preferably used. These carbodiimide compounds can be prepared by decarboxylative condensation of organic polyisocyanates. For example, they can be synthesized by decarboxylative condensation of various organic polyisocyanates at a temperature of about 70 °C or more in an inert solvent or without using a solvent in the presence of a carbodiimidation catalyst. The isocyanate content is preferably 0.1 to 5 %, more preferably 1 to 3 %. The content in the above ranges tends to facilitate the reaction with the polyamide resins and to improve hydrolysis resistance. Organic polyisocyanates that can be used as starting materials for synthesizing the carbodiimide compounds include, for example, various organic diisocyanates such as aromatic diisocyanates, aliphatic diisocyanates and alicyclic diisocyanates and mixtures thereof. Examples of organic diisocyanates specifically include 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate, 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 4,4'-diphenyldimethylmethane diisocyanate, 1,3-phenylene diisocyanate, 1,4-phenylene diisocyanate, 2,4-tolylene diisocyanate, 2,6-tolylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, cyclohexane-1,4-diisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, dicyclohexylmethane-4,4-diisocyanate, methylcyclohexane diisocyanate, tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate, 2,6-diisopropylphenyl isocyanate, 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene-2,4-diisocyanate, methylenebis(4,1-cyclohexylene)diisocyanate and the like, and two or more of them can be used in combination. Among them, dicyclohexylmethane-4,4-diisocyanate and methylenebis(4,1-cyclohexylene)diisocyanate are preferred. To cap the ends of the carbodiimide compounds to control their degree of polymerization, end capping agents such as monoisocyanates are also preferably used. Monoisocyanates include, for example, phenyl isocyanate, tolyl isocyanate, dimethylphenyl isocyanate, cyclohexyl isocyanate, butyl isocyanate, naphthyl isocyanate and the like, and two or more of them can be used in combination. The end-capping agents are not limited to the monoisocyanates mentioned above, but may be any active hydrogen compounds capable of reacting with isocyanates. Examples of such active hydrogen compounds may include aliphatic, aromatic or alicyclic compounds having an -OH group such as methanol, ethanol, phenol, cyclohexanol, N-methylethanolamine, polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether and polypropylene glycol monomethyl ether; secondary amines such as diethylamine and dicyclohexylamine; primary amines such as butylamine and cyclohexylamine; carboxylic acids such as succinic acid, benzoic acid and cyclohexanecarboxylic acid; thiols such as ethyl mercaptan, allyl mercaptan and thiophenol; compounds having an epoxy group and the like, and two or more of them can be used in combination. Carbodiimidation catalysts that can be used include, for example, phospholene oxides such as 1-phenyl-2-phospholene-1-oxide, 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-phospholene-1-oxide, 1-ethyl-2-phospholene-1-oxide, 3-methyl-2-phospholene-1-oxide and 3-phospholene isomers thereof; metal catalysts such as tetrabutyl titanate and the like, among which 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-phospholene-1-oxide is preferred because of reactivity. Two or more of the carbodiimidation catalysts may be used in combination. The content of the carbodiimide compounds is preferably 0.1 to 2 parts by mass, more preferably 0.2 to 1.5 parts by mass, even more preferably 0.3 to 1.5 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of a polyamide resin. If it is less than 0.1 part by mass, hydrolysis resistance is insufficient so that uneven delivery is more likely to occur during melt kneading such as extrusion, leading to insufficient melt kneading. If it exceeds 2 parts by mass, however, the viscosity during melt kneading significantly increases, which may result in low melt kneadability and moldability. The polyamide resins of the present invention also preferably contain a stabilizer.
