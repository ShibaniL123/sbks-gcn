Article moveable between two positions and a method of combining two or more of the same The invention to which this application relates is an article or articles moveable between a first and second position when a predetermined condition is met. The invention further relates to a method of bringing two of said articles together in a predefined manner. Although the following description refers exclusively to the use of such articles as play toys and a method of playing with two or more of the same, the person skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention could also be used for various other purposes not limited to games. Collectable toys have been known for sometime. In particular, collectable "battling" toys are also known and have been provided in many different forms, for example, the range of battling collectables sold under the trade name Beyblade™ involve propelling two spinning collectable items into a battle arena, the collectable items subsequently making contact with one another as their spinning paths coincide. The winner is the one which remains spinning in the arena having either knocked the other off of its spinning axis or out of the arena entirely. Various techniques may be used by the user when introducing the collectable item to the arena, in order to provide their collectable item with an advantage against the opposing collectable item. Another form of collectable battling toy, sold under the trade name Bakugan™ involves toys that can transform from a first condition into a second condition prior to or during battle. Determination of the winner can be decided by a set of specific playing cards which can indicate what moves may be played or health points etc. may be gained. Again, as the battle/game progresses, users/players will have an indication of who may emerge as the eventual winner. However, neither of these sets of "battling" collectables provides a scenario where the final winner will remain unknown until the eventual outcome is known, with little or no indication prior to the outcome. It is therefore an aim of the present invention to provide an article that overcomes the aforementioned problems. It is a further aim of the present invention to provide a combination of two or more articles that overcomes the aforementioned problems.

Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying figures, wherein: Figures l a — d illustrate the opening stages of an article in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Figure 2 illustrates a plan view of an opened-out article in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Figure 3 illustrates a view of a magnet and retaining means on an article in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Figure 4 illustrates a combination of a pair of articles in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Figure 5 illustrates various possible combinations of two or more articles in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Figures 6a - b illustrate a separate body attachment for an article in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Referring firstly to Figures l a— d, there is provided an article in the form of a substantially cube-shaped playing collectable item or toy (1) . The toy (1) can be moved from a first position, shown in Figure l a, and a second position, wherein the toy (1) is completely inverted with respect to its first position. Figures l a — d illustrate the opening stages of the toy (1) from the first position in Figure l a to an intermediate position between the first and second positions in Figure d, shown more clearly in Figure 2. In this particular embodiment, the toy (1) is provided in a cube shape and is composed of six connected panels (3) . The panels (3) are biased, via biasing means, to move to the second position but are retained in the first position until a predetermined condition is met. When the predetermined condition is met, the toy (1) moves from the first position to the second position. A release catch (5) is located on one of the panels (3') and, when the toy (1) is in the first position, the catch (5) engages an adjacent panel (3"), retaining it and the remaining panels (3) in the first position. The panels (3, 3', 3") of the toy (1) are hinged and the release catch (5) retains adjacent free edges of two panels (3', 3") in position, thereby retaining the toy (1) in the first position. The toy (1) is retained in the first position by the release catch (5) against the action of a biasing force until such point that it is released. Biasing means in the form of springs (7) are provided to bias the toy (1) to the second position. The springs (7) are best illustrated in Figure 3. The springs (7) may be provided in various forms such as any or any combination of coil springs, leaf springs, torsion springs, hair springs and/or the like. In this particular embodiment, the springs (7) are provided as ^ coiled torsion springs. The springs (7) are located at the edge of a panel (3) , connecting the panel (3) on which it is located with an adjacent panel (3) . The series of springs (7) that are provided on the panels (3) bias the toy (1) to the second, inverted position. This biasing movement is only allowed, however, upon release of the catch (5) from the adjacent panel (3") to which it connects. When the catch (5) is released from the adjacent panel (3"), that panel (3") opens outwardly due to the biasing force of the springs (7), shown in Figure l b. The remaining panels (3), which had previously been held in place in the first position by panel (3") and a series of secondary catches (9) , subsequently open outwardly, as shown in Figures l c and d until the toy (1) is in an inverted, second position. The panel (3') on which the catch (5) is located is also provided with a first magnet (1 1), which is linked to a magnetic catch (13) . This magnetic catch (13) is, in turn connected to the release catch (5) on the panel (3) . Such connection provides for the release catch (5) to be magnetically releasable. The first magnet (11) may be provided as attached directly to the panel (3'), or in a preferred example, the magnet (11) is removably attachable to the panel (3') . When the first magnet (11) comes into contact or close proximity with a corresponding attracted magnet, or within a predefined distance of a corresponding attracted magnet, the magnet (11) releases the magnetic catch (13), which in turn allows the release catch (5) to cease from retaining adjacent panel (3") in the first position. Upon this release, the toy (1) moves from the first position to the second position under the force provided by the springs (7) . A second, attractive magnet (15) is also provided on the same panel (3') as the first magnet (11) and the release catch (5) and will serve to act in the manner described above when brought into contact or close proximity with, or within a predefined distance of, an equivalent article or toy. As with the first magnet (11) , the second magnet (15) may be provided as attached directly to the panel (3'), or in a preferred example, the second magnet (15) is also removably attachable to the panel (3') . The two magnets (11 , 15) located on the panel (3') may also be located in a plurality of positions on the panel (3') . These positions may be predetermined by the manufacturer of the toy (1) or, in some embodiments, may be selected and changed by the user of the toy (1) itself. In a preferred embodiment, as exemplified in Figures 6a - b, the magnets (611 , 615) are located on a separate body (617), which can be located on the toy (601) . In particular, the body (617) can be located on the panel (603') or placed into a hole (619) formed in the panel (603') . The magnets (611 , 615) can be located on or within the body (617), which, once inserted into the article (601) , enable the toy (601) to behave as described above. The body (617) may be removed from the toy (601) just as easily as it is attached, and may also be substituted / interchanged with other similar bodies, which may include first and second magnets in a different configuration from those in the first body (617) . Additional attachments may also be provided for the article in order to allow a user to customise the same. For example, a face (621), as shown in Figure 6a may be provided as attachable either to the toy (601) directly or to the body (617) that is subsequently attached to the toy (601) . This enables a user to customise their particular toy and, further, special characteristics and/or points may be associated with each face in the scenario where multiple faces are provided. A second article or toy (201) with the same features as described above for the first toy (1 , 601) may be provided. In this embodiment, the second toy (201) also has first and second magnets (211 , 215) associated therewith, the second of which (215) is provided to act as an attractive magnet for the first magnet (1 1) on the first toy (1), in the manner described above. As with the first toy (1 , 601), the magnets (211 , 215) of the second toy (201) may also be removably attached directly or within a removably attachable body, as described above. Thus, as the first (1) and second (201) toys are moved together (represented by blocks A and B in Figure 4) the attractive second magnet (215) on the second toy (201) activates the first magnet (11) on the first toy (1) when the two magnets contact each other or are brought within a predefined distance of one another. This enables the predetermined condition to be met in the first toy (1), wherein the magnet (11) releases the magnetic catch (13), which in turn allows the release catch (5) to cease from retaining adjacent panel (3") in the first position. The first toy (1) subsequently moves from the first position into the second, inverted position. In this instance, the second, inverted position involves the first toy (1) at least partially engulfing, enclosing and/or entrapping the second toy (201) . A third article or toy (301) may be introduced, which has the same features as the first and second toys (1 , 201 , 601) described above. In this instance, the second magnet (315) on the third toy (301) acts as an attractive magnet for the first magnet (211) on the second toy (201) . Therefore, when the second and third toys (201 , 301) are brought into contact or close proximity with, or moved within a predefined distance of each other, the predetermined condition for the second toy (201) is met and it subsequently moves from the first position to the second, inverted position at least partially engulfing, enclosing and/or entrapping the third toy (301) . The first magnet (311) on the third toy (301) is therefore activated by the attractive second magnet (15) provided on the first toy (1) . Therefore, when the first and third toys (1 , 301) are brought into contact or close proximity with, or moved within a predefined distance of each other, the predetermined condition for the third toy (301) is met and it subsequently moves from the first position to the second, inverted position at least partially engulfing, enclosing and/or entrapping the first toy (1) . This series of scenarios is depicted in Figure 5, wherein each toy (1 , 201 , 301) is represented by blocks A, B and C. As will be appreciated, a "rock, paper, scissors" scenario is provided by the provision of the above toys (1 , 201 , 301 , 601) , although it will be appreciated that other such scenarios may also be provided for using arrangements such as this. Each of the toys may be customised by their respective users who can choose not only which body (617) attaches to the toy, thereby defining the magnetic configuration of the toy and which other toys it will activate / be activated by, but also the user may choose which face is to be attached. This provides a means for additional scoring, rather than merely a "paper beats rock" etc. scenario; each face will have a certain number of points associated with it, positive or negative, and so a scoring system may be introduced for multiple users of the toys. It will be appreciated that the above described toy (1) need not be restricted to a cube shape for the present invention to function as described. For example, such a mechanism may be provided for the movement of an article or toy from a first position to a second, substantially inverted position, wherein the article or toy is a pyramid, having either a three- (tetrahedron) or four-sided (pentahedron) base; octahedron; dodecahedron; icosahedron and/or the like.
