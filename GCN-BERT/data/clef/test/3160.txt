Y i0 Z0 Z5 This invention pertains to propeller type fans, and more particularly to a one piece, molded fan construction that is adapted to cool its driving motor while performing its ordinary air moving function. An object of this invèntion is to provide a molded propeller fan construction wíth a plurality of integrally molded vanes, in the nature of a centrifugal fan, for impelling cooling aìr through the motor and for agítating normally quiescent air on the surface of the motor. Another object is to provide a fan that is inexpensive to manufacture, that is easyto mold and that presents a pleasing appearance when installed in domestìc appliances such as window mounted fans and the like. A further object is to provide a more compact fan and motor assembly. The foregoing objects and advantages and other more specific objects wí[l be er[dent when proceeding through the following detailed descríption of an illustrated embodiment of the invention, partìcularly when considering in connection with the accompanying drawing in whích: Fig, [ lB a front elevation perspective view of the novel fan assembly with a part broken away to reveal the fan driving motor; Fig. Z is a rear elevation perspective view of the fan assembly showíng particularly the coníiguration and location of the motor cooling vanes and also showing the motor in outline; and, Fig. 3 is a partial sectional view taken approximately on a line corresponding with 3-3 in Fig. Z. The one-piece fan blade, designated by the reference numeral i, may be molded of any suitable plastic material, such as polystyrene, and it may be colored for harmonizing with other elements of the appliance in which it is installed. Referríng to the drawing, fan 1 comprises a cup-like central portion including a substantially flat front wall Z and an axially and lO ZO rear« ardly extending periphera! wall 3. The back edge 4, see Fig. 2, of peripheral wall 3 tapers until it disappears where St intersects at along the heel of any blade 6. By referring to Fig. l, it may be seen that peripheral wall 3 also fades into oblivion where it intersects at 7 with the heel of any fan blade 6. This construction minimizes the amount of molding material and augments cooling of fan motor 8 as will be better appreciated subsequently. The fan blades 6, of which there are three, are integrally molded with peripheral wall 3 at an oblique angle with respect to the axis of fan rotation. Fan 1 is adapted for mounting on a motor shaft 9 by the provision of a hub assembly le, sec Fig. 3, which in this example comprises a metal ferrule ll having a radially extending annular flange 12 for facilitating its attachment to front Niall 2 by means of rivets or screws 13. To elilninate the effects of vibration and thereby minimize noise level, the :'errule 11 is interiorly lined wlth a resilient bushing lA made oP rubber or similar material. Tightly compressed within bushing I/ is a sleeve 15 provided with a set screw 16 for fastening the hub assembly le to motor shaft 9. Of course, fan 1 may be attached to the motor by any suitable hub means, the one described being merely illustrative. In Fig. i, the pitch of blades 6 is such that if the fan rotates a clockwise direction as there observed, air will be impelled toward the observer. The individual blades 6, considering rotation to be clockwise, have theiì trailing edges 17 bent slightly forward as seen in Fig. l, and their leading edges 18 bent slightly backwardly as seen in that figure. The rear of motor 8 is provided with a plurality of apertures 19a and the front is provided »rith similar apertures 19 that communicate interiorly of motor 8 to create cooling ducts extending from end to end thereof. The manner in which the air stream from these apertures is affected by the fan wíll become evident in the forthcoming paragraphs that complete description of the fan. i: i0 lõ ZO -h60930.8 On the inner or rear side of end »mll 2 there are provided a plurality of radially disposed, rib-like, integrally molded, arcuate vanes originating near the rotational central of the fan and terminating where they merge with the interior of peripheral wall 3 at 21. In Fig. 2 it can be seen that certain of the vanes have axially extending portions 22 that run confluently from front wall 2 along the peripheral wall 3, whereupon they continue into the fan blades 6 until they taper into oblivion at their terminal ends 23. In Fig. 3 it may be seen that the front end of motor 8 is located as close as is permissible to the back edge of vanes 20 so that the front apertures 19 of the motor are constantly passed by the moving vanes when the fan is revolving. The vanes 20 thereby create a suction effect in the vicinity of apertures 19 which draws air through the motor for the purpose of cooling it. Since the vanes 20 skim the end of the motor, they are also effective to agitate the normally quiescent layer of air that surrounds a motor and ordinarily inhibits heat radiation therefrom. The axially extending portion 22 of certain of the vanes 20 has a similar effect on the outside periphery of the motor as ís clearly evident from observing Fig. 3. fl%en the fan is rotating in a clockwise direction, as it is view( in Fig. l, the principal air stream is impelled toward the observer and smoke test traces have confirmed that a secondary air stream enters through rear motor apertures 19a and passes out from front apertures 19, whereupon the secondary air is expelled slightly backwardly and radially outward into the main air strewn between adjacent trailing and leading edges 17, 18 of successive fan blades 6. 't en the fan blade 1 is rotated in a counterclockwise direction as viewed in Fig. l, and the air is flowing away from the observer, smoke test traces show that secondary air is again draws through rear apertures 18, labelled from front apertures 19, and backwardly in a v Z0 5helical trace surrounding the periphery of the motor 8, after which it expands radially and merges with the principal air stream as it progress from the front to the rear of the fan. In the illustrative embodiment, vanes 20 arè curved so as to adopt the charade mystics of aback-pitched centrifugal fan when the fan is operating if c clockwise direction as viewed in Fig. 1. Conversely, when the fan blade ís rotating counterclockwise, vanes Z0 are pitched in a manner to adopt the characteristics of a forwardly pitched centrifugal fan. In either case, however, the vanes Z0 are effective for drawing air from front motor apertures 19 and for expelling it into the path of the principal air stream, the different effects being manifested principally by what happens after the air leaves the enclosed central portion of the fan. Some changes in the form and construction of the fan assembly are understood to be possible, and, indeed, suggested by the discussion in the specification. Accordingly, if is here intended to embrace modified forma of the invention in accordance w th the scope of the claims which follows. e r lO The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive l.
