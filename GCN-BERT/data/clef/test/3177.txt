The present invention relates to active compound combinations, in particular within a fungicide composition, which comprises (A) a thiazolylisoxazoline of formula (I) and a further fungicidally active compound (B). Moreover, the invention relates to a method for curatively or preventively controlling the phytopathogenic fungi of plants or crops, to the use of a combination according to the invention for the treatment of seed, to a method for protecting a seed and not at least to the treated seed. It is already known that certain thiazolylisoxazolines can be used as fungicides (see WO2008/013925, WO2008/013622, WO2009/094407, WO2009/094445, WO2009/055514, WO2010/065579, WO2011/85170, and WO 2011/076699). Since the ecological and economic demands made on modern active ingredients, for example fungicides, are increasing constantly, for example with respect to activity spectrum, toxicity, selectivity, application rate, formation of residues and favourable manufacture, and there can also be problems, for example, with resistances, there is a constant need to develop novel fungicidal compositions which have advantages over the known compositions at least in some areas. The present invention provides active compound combinations/compositions which in some aspects at least achieve the stated objective. It has now been found, surprisingly, that the combinations according to the invention not only bring about the additive enhancement of the spectrum of action with respect to the phytopathogen to be controlled that was in principle to be expected but achieves a synergistic effect which extends the range of action of the component (A) and of the component (B) in two ways. Firstly, the rates of application of the component (A) and of the component (B) are lowered whilst the action remains equally good. Secondly, the combination still achieves a high degree of phytopathogen control even where the two individual compounds have become totally ineffective in such a low application rate range. This allows, on the one hand, a substantial broadening of the spectrum of phytopathogens that can be controlled and, on the other hand, increased safety in use. In addition to the fungicidal synergistic activity, the active compound combinations according to the invention have further surprising properties which, in a wider sense, may also be called synergistic, such as, for example: broadening of the activity spectrum to other phytopathogens, for example to resistant strains of plant diseases; lower application rates of the active compounds; sufficient control of pests with the aid of the active compound combinations according to the invention even at application rates where the individual compounds show no or virtually no activity; advantageous behaviour during formulation or during use, for example during grinding, sieving, emulsifying, dissolving or dispensing; improved storage stability and light stability; advantageous residue formation; improved toxicological or ecotoxicological behaviour; improved properties of the plant, for example better growth, increased harvest yields, a better developed root system, a larger leaf area, greener leaves, stronger shoots, less seed required, lower phytotoxicity, mobilization of the defence system of the plant, good compatibility with plants. Thus, the use of the active compound combinations or compositions according to the invention contributes considerably to keeping young cereal stands healthy, which increases, for example, the winter survival of the cereal seed treated, and also safeguards quality and yield. Moreover, the active compound combinations according to the invention may contribute to enhanced systemic action. Even if the individual compounds of the combination have no sufficient systemic properties, the active compound combinations according to the invention may still have this property. In a similar manner, the active compound combinations according to the invention may result in higher persistency of the fungicidal action. Accordingly, the present invention provides a combination comprising: (A) at least one thiazolylisoxazoline of formula (I) in which R1 represents phenyl, which is at least substituted with one methylsulfonyloxy and optionally be additionally substituted by one substituents selected from the group consisting of methyl, methoxy, fluoro or chloro, or an agrochemically acceptable salt thereof, and (B) at least one further active compound selected from the following groups (1) inhibitors of the ergosterol synthesis,(2) inhibitors of the respiratory chain at complex I or II,(3) inhibitors of the respiratory chain at complex III,(4) inhibitors of the mitosis and cell division,(5) compounds capable of having a multisite action,(6) compounds capable of inducing a host defense,(7) inhibitors of the amino acid and/or protein biosynthesis,(8) inhibitors of the ATP production,(9) inhibitors of the cell wall synthesis,(10) inhibitors of the lipid and membrane synthesis,(11) inhibitors of the melanine biosynthesis,(12) inhibitors of the nucleic acid synthesis,(13) inhibitors of the signal transduction,(14) compounds capable of acting as uncoupler,(15) other fungicides.

Preferably the order of applying the compounds (A) and (B) is not essential for working the present invention. Composition/Formulation The present invention furthermore relates to compositions for combating/controlling undesirable microorganisms comprising the active compound combinations according to the invention. Preferably, the compositions are fungicidal compositions comprising agriculturally suitable auxiliaries, solvents, carriers, surfactants or extenders. In the context of the present invention, “control of harmful microorganisms” means a reduction in infestation by harmful microorganisms, compared with the untreated plant measured as fungicidal efficacy, preferably a reduction by 25-50%, compared with the untreated plant (100%), more preferably a reduction by 40-79%, compared with the untreated plant (100%); even more preferably, the infection by harmful microorganisms is entirely suppressed (by 70-100%). The control may be curative, i.e. for treatment of already infected plants, or protective, for protection of plants which have not yet been infected. An “effective but non-phytotoxic amount” means an amount of the inventive composition which is sufficient to control the fungal disease of the plant in a satisfactory manner or to eradicate the fungal disease completely, and which, at the same time, does not cause any significant symptoms of phytotoxicity. In general, this application rate may vary within a relatively wide range. It depends on several factors, for example on the fungus to be controlled, the plant, the climatic conditions and the ingredients of the inventive compositions. Suitable organic solvents include all polar and non-polar organic solvents usually employed for formulation purposes. Preferable the solvents are selected from ketones, e.g. methyl-isobutyl-ketone and cyclohexanone, amides, e.g. dimethyl formamide and alkanecarboxylic acid amides, e.g. N,N-dimethyl decaneamide and N,N-dimethyl octanamide, furthermore cyclic solvents, e.g. N-methyl-pyrrolidone, N-octyl-pyrrolidone, N-dodecyl-pyrrolidone, N-octyl-caprolactame, N-dodecyl-caprolactame and butyrolactone, furthermore strong polar solvents, e.g. dimethylsulfoxide, and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. xylol, Solvesso™, mineral oils, e.g. white spirit, petroleum, alkyl benzenes and spindle oil, also esters, e.g. propyleneglycol-monomethylether acetate, adipic acid dibutylester, acetic acid hexylester, acetic acid heptylester, citric acid tri-n-butylester and phthalic acid di-n-butylester, and also alkohols, e.g. benzyl alcohol and 1-methoxy-2-propanol. Furthermore the invention relates to a method of combating undesirable microorganisms, characterized in that the active compound combinations according to the invention are applied to the phytopathogenic fungi and/or their habitat. According to the invention, carrier is to be understood as meaning a natural or synthetic, organic or inorganic substance which is mixed or combined with the active compounds for better applicability, in particular for application to plants or plant parts or seeds.

The fact that the active ingredients are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations required for controlling plant diseases allows the treatment of above-ground parts of plants, of propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil. According to the invention all plants and plant parts can be treated. By plants is meant all plants and plant populations such as desirable and undesirable wild plants, cultivars and plant varieties (whether or not protectable by plant variety or plant breeder's rights).

Plant Growth Regulation In some cases, the inventive compositions can, at particular concentrations or application rates, also be used as herbicides, safeners, growth regulators or agents to improve plant properties, or as microbicides, for example as fungicides, antimycotics, bactericides, viricides (including compositions against viroids) or as compositions against MLO (Mycoplasma-like organisms) and RLO (Rickettsia-like organisms). If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active ingredients. The inventive active combinations intervene in the metabolism of the plants and can therefore also be used as growth regulators. Plant growth regulators may exert various effects on plants. The effect of the substances depends essentially on the time of application in relation to the developmental stage of the plant, and also on the amounts of active ingredient applied to the plants or their environment and on the type of application. In each case, growth regulators should have a particular desired effect on the crop plants. Plant growth-regulating compounds can be used, for example, to inhibit the vegetative growth of the plants. Such inhibition of growth is of economic interest, for example, in the case of grasses, since it is thus possible to reduce the frequency of grass cutting in ornamental gardens, parks and sport facilities, on roadsides, at airports or in fruit crops. Also of significance is the inhibition of the growth of herbaceous and woody plants on roadsides and in the vicinity of pipelines or overhead cables, or quite generally in areas where vigorous plant growth is unwanted. Also important is the use of growth regulators for inhibition of the longitudinal growth of cereal. This reduces or completely eliminates the risk of lodging of the plants prior to harvest. In addition, growth regulators in the case of cereals can strengthen the culm, which also counteracts lodging. The employment of growth regulators for shortening and strengthening culms allows the deployment of higher fertilizer volumes to increase the yield, without any risk of lodging of the cereal crop. In many crop plants, inhibition of vegetative growth allows denser planting, and it is thus possible to achieve higher yields based on the soil surface. Another advantage of the smaller plants obtained in this way is that the crop is easier to cultivate and harvest. Inhibition of the vegetative plant growth may also lead to enhanced yields because the nutrients and assimilates are of more benefit to flower and fruit formation than to the vegetative parts of the plants. Frequently, growth regulators can also be used to promote vegetative growth. This is of great benefit when harvesting the vegetative plant parts. However, promoting vegetative growth may also promote generative growth in that more assimilates are formed, resulting in more or larger fruits. In some cases, yield increases may be achieved by manipulating the metabolism of the plant, without any detectable changes in vegetative growth. In addition, growth regulators can be used to alter the composition of the plants, which in turn may result in an improvement in quality of the harvested products. For example, it is possible to increase the sugar content in sugar beet, sugar cane, pineapples and in citrus fruit, or to increase the protein content in soya or cereals. It is also possible, for example, to use growth regulators to inhibit the degradation of desirable ingredients, for example sugar in sugar beet or sugar cane, before or after harvest. It is also possible to positively influence the production or the elimination of secondary plant ingredients. One example is the stimulation of the flow of latex in rubber trees. Under the influence of growth regulators, parthenocarpic fruits may be formed. In addition, it is possible to influence the sex of the flowers. It is also possible to produce sterile pollen, which is of great importance in the breeding and production of hybrid seed. Use of growth regulators can control the branching of the plants. On the one hand, by breaking apical dominance, it is possible to promote the development of side shoots, which may be highly desirable particularly in the cultivation of ornamental plants, also in combination with an inhibition of growth. On the other hand, however, it is also possible to inhibit the growth of the side shoots. This effect is of particular interest, for example, in the cultivation of tobacco or in the cultivation of tomatoes. Under the influence of growth regulators, the amount of leaves on the plants can be controlled such that defoliation of the plants is achieved at a desired time. Such defoliation plays a major role in the mechanical harvesting of cotton, but is also of interest for facilitating harvesting in other crops, for example in viticulture. Defoliation of the plants can also be undertaken to lower the transpiration of the plants before they are transplanted. Growth regulators can likewise be used to regulate fruit dehiscence. On the one hand, it is possible to prevent premature fruit dehiscence. On the other hand, it is also possible to promote fruit dehiscence or even flower abortion to achieve a desired mass (“thinning”), in order to eliminate alternation. Alternation is understood to mean the characteristic of some fruit species, for endogenous reasons, to deliver very different yields from year to year Finally, it is possible to use growth regulators at the time of harvest to reduce the forces required to detach the fruits, in order to allow mechanical harvesting or to facilitate manual harvesting. Growth regulators can also be used to achieve faster or else delayed ripening of the harvested material before or after harvest. This is particularly advantageous as it allows optimal adjustment to the requirements of the market. Moreover, growth regulators in some cases can improve the fruit colour. In addition, growth regulators can also be used to concentrate maturation within a certain period of time. This establishes the prerequisites for complete mechanical or manual harvesting in a single operation, for example in the case of tobacco, tomatoes or coffee. By using growth regulators, it is additionally possible to influence the resting of seed or buds of the plants, such that plants such as pineapple or ornamental plants in nurseries, for example, germinate, sprout or flower at a time when they are normally not inclined to do so. In areas where there is a risk of frost, it may be desirable to delay budding or germination of seeds with the aid of growth regulators, in order to avoid damage resulting from late frosts. Finally, growth regulators can induce resistance of the plants to frost, drought or high salinity of the soil. This allows the cultivation of plants in regions which are normally unsuitable for this purpose. Resistance Induction/Plant Health and Other Effects The active combinations according to the invention also exhibit a potent strengthening effect in plants. Accordingly, they can be used for mobilizing the defences of the plant against attack by undesirable microorganisms. Plant-strengthening (resistance-inducing) substances are to be understood as meaning, in the present context, those substances which are capable of stimulating the defence system of plants in such a way that the treated plants, when subsequently inoculated with undesirable microorganisms, develop a high degree of resistance to these microorganisms. The active combinations according to the invention are also suitable for increasing the yield of crops. In addition, they show reduced toxicity and are well tolerated by plants. Further, in context with the present invention plant physiology effects comprise the following: Abiotic stress tolerance, comprising temperature tolerance, drought tolerance and recovery after drought stress, water use efficiency (correlating to reduced water consumption), flood tolerance, ozone stress and UV tolerance, tolerance towards chemicals like heavy metals, salts, pesticides (safener) etc. Biotic stress tolerance, comprising increased fungal resistance and increased resistance against nematodes, viruses and bacteria. In context with the present invention, biotic stress tolerance preferably comprises increased fungal resistance and increased resistance against nematodes Increased plant vigor, comprising plant health/plant quality and seed vigor, reduced stand failure, improved appearance, increased recovery, improved greening effect and improved photosynthetic efficiency. Effects on Plant Hormones and/or Functional Enzymes. Effects on growth regulators (promoters), comprising earlier germination, better emergence, more developed root system and/or improved root growth, increased ability of tillering, more productive tillers, earlier flowering, increased plant height and/or biomass, shorting of stems, improvements in shoot growth, number of kernels/ear, number of ears/m2, number of stolons and/or number of flowers, enhanced harvest index, bigger leaves, less dead basal leaves, improved phyllotaxy, earlier maturation/earlier fruit finish, homogenous riping, increased duration of grain filling, better fruit finish, bigger fruit/vegetable size, sprouting resistance and reduced lodging. Increased yield, referring to total biomass per hectare, yield per hectare, kernel/fruit weight, seed size and/or hectolitre weight as well as to increased product quality, comprising: improved processability relating to size distribution (kernel, fruit, etc.), homogenous riping, grain moisture, better milling, better vinification, better brewing, increased juice yield, harvestability, digestibility, sedimentation value, falling number, pod stability, storage stability, improved fiber length/strength/uniformity, increase of milk and/or meet quality of silage fed animals, adaption to cooking and frying; further comprising improved marketability relating to improved fruit/grain quality, size distribution (kernel, fruit, etc.), increased storage/shelf-life, firmness/softness, taste (aroma, texture, etc.), grade (size, shape, number of berries, etc.), number of berries/fruits per bunch, crispness, freshness, coverage with wax, frequency of physiological disorders, colour, etc.; further comprising increased desired ingredients such as e.g. protein content, fatty acids, oil content, oil quality, aminoacid composition, sugar content, acid content (pH), sugar/acid ratio (Brix), polyphenols, starch content, nutritional quality, gluten content/index, energy content, taste, etc.; and further comprising decreased undesired ingredients such as e.g. less mycotoxines, less aflatoxines, geosmin level, phenolic aromas, lacchase, polyphenol oxidases and peroxidases, nitrate content etc. Sustainable agriculture, comprising nutrient use efficiency, especially nitrogen (N)-use efficiency, phosphours (P)-use efficiency, water use efficiency, improved transpiration, respiration and/or CO2 assimilation rate, better nodulation, improved Ca-metabolism etc. Delayed senescence, comprising improvement of plant physiology which is manifested, for example, in a longer grain filling phase, leading to higher yield, a longer duration of green leaf colouration of the plant and thus comprising colour (greening), water content, dryness etc. Accordingly, in the context of the present invention, it has been found that the specific inventive application of the active compound combination makes it possible to prolong the green leaf area duration, which delays the maturation (senescence) of the plant. The main advantage to the farmer is a longer grain filling phase leading to higher yield. There is also an advantage to the farmer on the basis of greater flexibility in the harvesting time. Therein “sedimentation value” is a measure for protein quality and describes according to Zeleny (Zeleny value) the degree of sedimentation of flour suspended in a lactic acid solution during a standard time interval. This is taken as a measure of the baking quality. Swelling of the gluten fraction of flour in lactic acid solution affects the rate of sedimentation of a flour suspension. Both a higher gluten content and a better gluten quality give rise to slower sedimentation and higher Zeleny test values. The sedimentation value of flour depends on the wheat protein composition and is mostly correlated to the protein content, the wheat hardness, and the volume of pan and hearth loaves. A stronger correlation between loaf volume and Zeleny sedimentation volume compared to SDS sedimentation volume could be due to the protein content influencing both the volume and Zeleny value (Czech J. Food Sci. Vol. 21, No. 3: 91-96, 2000). Further the “falling number” as mentioned herein is a measure for the baking quality of cereals, especially of wheat. The falling number test indicates that sprout damage may have occurred. It means that changes to the physical properties of the starch portion of the wheat kernel has already happened. Therein, the falling number instrument analyzes viscosity by measuring the resistance of a flour and water paste to a falling plunger. The time (in seconds) for this to happen is known as the falling number. The falling number results are recorded as an index of enzyme activity in a wheat or flour sample and results are expressed in time as seconds. A high falling number (for example, above 300 seconds) indicates minimal enzyme activity and sound quality wheat or flour. A low falling number (for example, below 250 seconds) indicates substantial enzyme activity and sprout-damaged wheat or flour. The term “more developed root system”/“improved root growth” refers to longer root system, deeper root growth, faster root growth, higher root dry/fresh weight, higher root volume, larger root surface area, bigger root diameter, higher root stability, more root branching, higher number of root hairs, and/or more root tips and can be measured by analyzing the root architecture with suitable methodologies and Image analysis programmes (e.g. WinRhizo). The term “crop water use efficiency” refers technically to the mass of agriculture produce per unit water consumed and economically to the value of product(s) produced per unit water volume consumed and can e.g. be measured in terms of yield per ha, biomass of the plants, thousand-kernel mass, and the number of ears per m2. The term “nitrogen-use efficiency” refers technically to the mass of agriculture produce per unit nitrogen consumed and economically to the value of product(s) produced per unit nitrogen consumed, reflecting uptake and utilization efficiency. Improvement in greening/improved colour and improved photosynthetic efficiency as well as the delay of senescence can be measured with well-known techniques such as a HandyPea system (Hansatech). Fv/Fm is a parameter widely used to indicate the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (PSII). This parameter is widely considered to be a selective indication of plant photosynthetic performance with healthy samples typically achieving a maximum Fv/Fm value of approx. 0.85. Values lower than this will be observed if a sample has been exposed to some type of biotic or abiotic stress factor which has reduced the capacity for photochemical quenching of energy within PSII. Fv/Fm is presented as a ratio of variable fluorescence (Fv) over the maximum fluorescence value (Fm). The Performance Index is essentially an indicator of sample vitality. (See e.g. Advanced Techniques in Soil Microbiology, 2007, 11, 319-341; Applied Soil Ecology, 2000, 15, 169-182.) The improvement in greening/improved colour and improved photosynthetic efficiency as well as the delay of senescence can also be assessed by measurement of the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), measurement of the chlorophyll content, e.g. by the pigment extraction method of Ziegler and Ehle, measurement of the photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm ratio), determination of shoot growth and final root and/or canopy biomass, determination of tiller density as well as of root mortality. Within the context of the present invention preference is given to improving plant physiology effects which are selected from the group comprising: enhanced root growth/more developed root system, improved greening, improved water use efficiency (correlating to reduced water consumption), improved nutrient use efficiency, comprising especially improved nitrogen (N)-use efficiency, delayed senescence and enhanced yield. Within the enhancement of yield preference is given as to an improvement in the sedimentation value and the falling number as well as to the improvement of the protein and sugar content—especially with plants selected from the group of cereals (preferably wheat). Preferably the novel use of the fungicidal compositions of the present invention relates to a combined use of a) preventively and/or curatively controlling pathogenic fungi and/or nematodes, with or without resistance management, and b) at least one of enhanced root growth, improved greening, improved water use efficiency, delayed senescence and enhanced yield. From group b) enhancement of root system, water use efficiency and N-use efficiency is particularly preferred. Seed Treatment The invention further comprises a method for treating seed. The invention further relates to seed which has been treated by one of the methods described in the previous paragraph. The inventive seeds are employed in methods for the protection of seed from unwanted microorganisms. In these methods, seed treated with at least one inventive active ingredient is used. The inventive compositions are also suitable for treating seed. A large part of the damage to crop plants caused by harmful organisms is triggered by the infection of the seed during storage or after sowing, and also during and after germination of the plant. This phase is particularly critical since the roots and shoots of the growing plant are particularly sensitive, and even minor damage may result in the death of the plant. There is therefore a great interest in protecting the seed and the germinating plant by using appropriate compositions. The control of phytopathogenic fungi by treating the seed of plants has been known for a long time and is the subject of constant improvements. However, the treatment of seed entails a series of problems which cannot always be solved in a satisfactory manner. For instance, it is desirable to develop methods for protecting the seed and the germinating plant, which dispense with, or at least significantly reduce, the additional deployment of crop protection compositions after planting or after emergence of the plants. It is also desirable to optimize the amount of the active ingredient used so as to provide the best possible protection for the seed and the germinating plant from attack by phytopathogenic fungi, but without damaging the plant itself by the active ingredient employed. In particular, methods for the treatment of seed should also take account of the intrinsic fungicidal properties of transgenic plants in order to achieve optimal protection of the seed and the germinating plant with a minimum expenditure of crop protection compositions. The present invention therefore also relates to a method for protection of seed and germinating plants from attack by phytopathogenic fungi, by treating the seed with an inventive composition. The invention likewise relates to the use of the inventive compositions for treatment of seed to protect the seed and the germinating plant from phytopathogenic fungi. The invention further relates to seed which has been treated with an inventive composition for protection from phytopathogenic fungi. The control of phytopathogenic fungi which damage plants post-emergence is effected primarily by treating the soil and the above-ground parts of plants with crop protection compositions. Owing to the concerns regarding a possible influence of the crop protection compositions on the environment and the health of humans and animals, there are efforts to reduce the amount of active ingredients deployed. One of the advantages of the present invention is that the particular systemic properties of the inventive active ingredients and compositions mean that treatment of the seed with these active ingredients and compositions not only protects the seed itself, but also the resulting plants after emergence, from phytopathogenic fungi. In this way, the immediate treatment of the crop at the time of sowing or shortly thereafter can be dispensed with. It is likewise considered to be advantageous that the inventive compositions can especially also be used with transgenic seed, in which case the plant growing from this seed is capable of expressing a protein which acts against pests. By virtue of the treatment of such seed with the inventive active ingredients or compositions, merely the expression of the protein, for example an insecticidal protein, can control certain pests. Surprisingly, a further synergistic effect can be observed in this case, which additionally increases the effectiveness for protection against attack by pests. The inventive compositions are suitable for protecting seed of any plant variety which is used in agriculture, in greenhouses, in forests or in horticulture and viticulture. In particular, this is the seed of cereals (such as wheat, barley, rye, triticale, sorghum/millet and oats), maize, cotton, soya beans, rice, potatoes, sunflower, bean, coffee, beet (for example sugar beet and fodder beet), peanut, oilseed rape, poppy, olive, coconut, cocoa, sugar cane, tobacco, vegetables (such as tomato, cucumbers, onions and lettuce), turf and ornamentals (see also below). The treatment of the seed of cereals (such as wheat, barley, rye, triticale and oats), maize and rice is of particular significance. As also described below, the treatment of transgenic seed with the inventive active ingredients or compositions is of particular significance. This relates to the seed of plants containing at least one heterologous gene which enables the expression of a polypeptide or protein having insecticidal properties. The heterologous gene in transgenic seed can originate, for example, from microorganisms of the species Bacillus, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Trichoderma, Clavibacter, Glomus or Gliocladium. This heterologous gene preferably originates from Bacillus sp., in which case the gene product is effective against the European maize borer and/or the Western maize rootworm. The heterologous gene more preferably originates from Bacillus thuringiensis. In the context of the present invention, the inventive composition is applied to the seed alone or in a suitable formulation. Preferably, the seed is treated in a state in which it is sufficiently stable for no damage to occur in the course of treatment. In general, the seed can be treated at any time between harvest and sowing. It is customary to use seed which has been separated from the plant and freed from cobs, shells, stalks, coats, hairs or the flesh of the fruits. For example, it is possible to use seed which has been harvested, cleaned and dried down to a moisture content of less than 15% by weight. Alternatively, it is also possible to use seed which, after drying, for example, has been treated with water and then dried again. When treating the seed, care must generally be taken that the amount of the inventive composition applied to the seed and/or the amount of further additives is selected such that the germination of the seed is not impaired, or that the resulting plant is not damaged. This has to be borne in mind in particular in the case of active ingredients which can have phytotoxic effects at certain application rates. The inventive compositions can be applied directly, i.e. without containing any other components and without having been diluted. In general, it is preferable to apply the compositions to the seed in the form of a suitable formulation. Suitable formulations and methods for seed treatment are known to those skilled in the art and are described, for example, in the following documents: U.S. Pat. No. 4,272,417, U.S. Pat. No. 4,245,432, U.S. Pat. No. 4,808,430, U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,739, US 2003/0176428 A1, WO 2002/080675, WO 2002/028186. The active ingredients usable in accordance with the invention can be converted to the customary seed dressing formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, slurries or other coating compositions for seed, and also ULV formulations. These formulations are prepared in a known manner, by mixing the active ingredients with customary additives, for example customary extenders and also solvents or diluents, dyes, wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, preservatives, secondary thickeners, adhesives, gibberellins and also water. Useful dyes which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all dyes which are customary for such purposes. It is possible to use either pigments, which are sparingly soluble in water, or dyes, which are soluble in water. Examples include the dyes known by the names Rhodamine B, C.I. Pigment Red 112 and C.I. Solvent Red 1. Useful wetting agents which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances which promote wetting and which are conventionally used for the formulation of active agrochemical ingredients. Preference is given to using alkyl naphthalenesulphonates, such as diisopropyl or diisobutyl naphthalenesulphonates. Useful dispersants and/or emulsifiers which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all nonionic, anionic and cationic dispersants conventionally used for the formulation of active agrochemical ingredients. Usable with preference are nonionic or anionic dispersants or mixtures of nonionic or anionic dispersants. Suitable nonionic dispersants include especially ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block polymers, alkylphenol polyglycol ethers and tristryrylphenol polyglycol ether, and the phosphated or sulphated derivatives thereof. Suitable anionic dispersants are especially lignosulphonates, polyacrylic acid salts and arylsulphonate/formaldehyde condensates. Antifoams which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all foam-inhibiting substances conventionally used for the formulation of active agrochemical ingredients. Silicone antifoams and magnesium stearate can be used with preference. Preservatives which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances usable for such purposes in agrochemical compositions. Examples include dichlorophens and benzyl alcohol hemiformal. Secondary thickeners which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances usable for such purposes in agrochemical compositions. Preferred examples include cellulose derivatives, acrylic acid derivatives, xanthan, modified clays and finely divided silica. Adhesives which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all customary binders usable in seed dressing products. Preferred examples include polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol and tylose. The gibberellins which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention may preferably be gibberellins A1, A3 (=gibberellic acid), A4 and A7; particular preference is given to using gibberellic acid. The gibberellins are known (cf. R. Wegler “Chemie der Pflanzenschutzund Schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel” [Chemistry of the Crop Protection Compositions and Pesticides], vol. 2, Springer Verlag, 1970, p. 401-412). The seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention can be used, either directly or after previously having been diluted with water, for the treatment of a wide range of different seed, including the seed of transgenic plants. In this case, additional synergistic effects may also occur in interaction with the substances formed by expression. For treatment of seed with the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention, or the preparations prepared therefrom by adding water, all mixing units usable customarily for the seed dressing are useful. Specifically, the procedure in the seed dressing is to place the seed into a mixer, to add the particular desired amount of seed dressing formulations, either as such or after prior dilution with water, and to mix everything until the formulation is distributed homogeneously on the seed. If appropriate, this is followed by a drying process. Mycotoxins In addition, the inventive treatment can reduce the mycotoxin content in the harvested material and the foods and feeds prepared therefrom. Mycotoxins include particularly, but not exclusively, the following: deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol, 15-Ac-DON, 3-Ac-DON, T2- and HT2-toxin, fumonisins, zearalenon, moniliformin, fusarin, diaceotoxyscirpenol (DAS), beauvericin, enniatin, fusaroproliferin, fusarenol, ochratoxins, patulin, ergot alkaloids and aflatoxins which can be produced, for example, by the following fungi: Fusarium spec., such as F. acuminatum, F. asiaticum, F. avenaceum, F. crookwellense, F. culmorum, F. graminearum (Gibberella zeae), F. equiseti, F. fujikoroi, F. musarum, F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum, F. poae, F. pseudograminearum, F. sambucinum, F. scirpi, F. semitectum, F. solani, F. sporotrichoides, F. langsethiae, F. subglutinans, F. tricinctum, F. verticillioides etc., and also by Aspergillus spec., such as A. flavus, A. parasiticus, A. nomius, A. ochraceus, A. clavatus, A. terreus, A. versicolor, Penicillium spec., such as P. verrucosum, P. viridicatum, P. citrinum, P. expansum, P. claviforme, P. roqueforti, Claviceps spec., such as C. purpurea, C. fusiformis, C. paspali, C. africana, Stachybotrys spec. and others. Material Protection The inventive compositions can also be used in the protection of materials, for protection of industrial materials against attack and destruction by unwanted microorganisms, for example fungi and insects. In addition, the inventive combinations can be used as antifouling compositions, alone or in combinations with other active ingredients. Industrial materials in the present context are understood to mean inanimate materials which have been prepared for use in industry. For example, industrial materials which are to be protected by inventive active ingredients from microbial alteration or destruction may be adhesives, glues, paper, wallpaper and board/cardboard, textiles, carpets, leather, wood, fibers and tissues, paints and plastic articles, cooling lubricants and other materials which can be infected with or destroyed by microorganisms. Parts of production plants and buildings, for example cooling-water circuits, cooling and heating systems and ventilation and air-conditioning units, which may be impaired by the proliferation of microorganisms may also be mentioned within the scope of the materials to be protected. Industrial materials within the scope of the present invention preferably include adhesives, sizes, paper and card, leather, wood, paints, cooling lubricants and heat transfer fluids, more preferably wood. The inventive active combinations may prevent adverse effects, such as rotting, decay, discoloration, decoloration or formation of mould. In the case of treatment of wood the compositions according to the invention may also be used against fungal diseases liable to grow on or inside timber. The term “timber” means all types of species of wood, and all types of working of this wood intended for construction, for example solid wood, high-density wood, laminated wood, and plywood. The method for treating timber according to the invention mainly consists in contacting one or more compounds according to the invention or a composition according to the invention; this includes for example direct application, spraying, dipping, injection or any other suitable means. In addition, the inventive combinations can be used to protect objects which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, especially hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling systems, from fouling. The inventive method for controlling unwanted fungi can also be employed for protecting storage goods. Storage goods are understood to mean natural substances of vegetable or animal origin or processed products thereof which are of natural origin, and for which long-term protection is desired. Storage goods of vegetable origin, for example plants or plant parts, such as stems, leaves, tubers, seeds, fruits, grains, can be protected freshly harvested or after processing by (pre)drying, moistening, comminuting, grinding, pressing or roasting. Storage goods also include timber, both unprocessed, such as construction timber, electricity poles and barriers, or in the form of finished products, such as furniture. Storage goods of animal origin are, for example, hides, leather, furs and hairs. The inventive active ingredients may prevent adverse effects, such as rotting, decay, discoloration, decoloration or formation of mould. Microorganisms capable of degrading or altering the industrial materials include, for example, bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae and slime organisms. The inventive active ingredients preferably act against fungi, especially moulds, wood-discoloring and wood-destroying fungi (Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Deuteromycetes and Zygomycetes), and against slime organisms and algae. Examples include microorganisms of the following genera: Alternaria, such as Alternaria tenuis; Aspergillus, such as Aspergillus niger; Chaetomium, such as Chaetomium globosum; Coniophora, such as Coniophora puetana; Lentinus, such as Lentinus tigrinus; Penicillium, such as Penicillium glaucum; Polyporus, such as Polyporus versicolor; Aureobasidium, such as Aureobasidium pullulans; Sclerophoma, such as Sclerophoma pityophila; Trichoderma, such as Trichoderma viride; Ophiostoma spp., Ceratocystis spp., Humicola spp., Petriella spp., Trichurus spp., Coriolus spp., Gloeophyllum spp., Pleurotus spp., Poria spp., Serpula spp. and Tyromyces spp., Cladosporium spp., Paecilomyces spp. Mucor spp., Escherichia, such as Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Candida spp. and Saccharomyces spp., such as Saccharomyces cerevisae. Antimycotic Activity In addition, the inventive combinations also have very good antimycotic activity. They have a very broad antimycotic activity spectrum, especially against dermatophytes and yeasts, moulds and diphasic fungi (for example against Candida species, such as C. albicans, C. glabrata), and Epidermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus species, such as A. niger and A. fumigatus, Trichophyton species, such as T. mentagrophytes, Microsporon species such as M. canis and M. audouinii. The list of these fungi by no means constitutes a restriction of the mycotic spectrum covered, and is merely of illustrative character. The inventive combinations can therefore be used both in medical and in non-medical applications. GMO As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts in accordance with the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and also parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The terms “parts” or “parts of plants” or “plant parts” have been explained above. More preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are commercially available or are in use are treated in accordance with the invention. Plant cultivars are understood to mean plants which have new properties (“traits”) and have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They can be cultivars, varieties, bio- or genotypes. The method of treatment according to the invention can be used in the treatment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), e.g. plants or seeds. Genetically modified plants (or transgenic plants) are plants of which a heterologous gene has been stably integrated into genome. The expression “heterologous gene” essentially means a gene which is provided or assembled outside the plant and when introduced in the nuclear, chloroplastic or mitochondrial genome gives the transformed plant new or improved agronomic or other properties by expressing a protein or polypeptide of interest or by downregulating or silencing other gene(s) which are present in the plant (using for example, antisense technology, cosuppression technology, RNA interference—RNAi—technology or microRNA—miRNA—technology). A heterologous gene that is located in the genome is also called a transgene. A transgene that is defined by its particular location in the plant genome is called a transformation or transgenic event. Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive (“synergistic”) effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the active compounds and compositions which can be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, bigger fruits, larger plant height, greener leaf color, earlier flowering, higher quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, higher sugar concentration within the fruits, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible, which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected. At certain application rates, the combinations according to the invention may also have a strengthening effect in plants. Accordingly, they are also suitable for mobilizing the defense system of the plant against attack by unwanted microorganisms. This may, if appropriate, be one of the reasons of the enhanced activity of the combinations according to the invention, for example against fungi. Plant-strengthening (resistance-inducing) substances are to be understood as meaning, in the present context, those substances or combinations of substances which are capable of stimulating the defense system of plants in such a way that, when subsequently inoculated with unwanted microorganisms, the treated plants display a substantial degree of resistance to these microorganisms. In the present case, unwanted microorganisms are to be understood as meaning phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. Thus, the substances according to the invention can be employed for protecting plants against attack by the abovementioned pathogens within a certain period of time after the treatment. The period of time within which protection is effected generally extends from 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7 days, after the treatment of the plants with the active compounds. Plants and plant cultivars which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which have genetic material which impart particularly advantageous, useful traits to these plants (whether obtained by breeding and/or biotechnological means). Plants and plant cultivars which are also preferably to be treated according to the combinations are resistant against one or more biotic stresses, i.e. said plants show a better defense against animal and microbial pests, such as against nematodes, insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria, viruses and/or viroids. Examples of nematode or insect resistant plants are described in e.g. U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11/765,491, 11/765,494, 10/926,819, 10/782,020, 12/032,479, 10/783,417, 10/782,096, 11/657,964, 12/192,904, 11/396,808, 12/166,253, 12/166,239, 12/166,124, 12/166,209, 11/762,886, 12/364,335, 11/763,947, 12/252,453, 12/209,354, 12/491,396, 12/497,221, 12/644,632, 12/646,004, 12/701,058, 12/718,059, 12/721,595, 12/638,591. Plants and plant cultivars which may also be treated according to the invention are those plants which are resistant to one or more abiotic stresses. Abiotic stress conditions may include, for example, drought, cold temperature exposure, heat exposure, osmotic stress, flooding, increased soil salinity, increased mineral exposure, ozone exposure, high light exposure, limited availability of nitrogen nutrients, limited availability of phosphorus nutrients, shade avoidance. Plants and plant cultivars which may also be treated according to the invention, are those plants characterized by enhanced yield characteristics. Increased yield in said plants can be the result of, for example, improved plant physiology, growth and development, such as water use efficiency, water retention efficiency, improved nitrogen use, enhanced carbon assimilation, improved photosynthesis, increased germination efficiency and accelerated maturation. Yield can furthermore be affected by improved plant architecture (under stress and non-stress conditions), including but not limited to, early flowering, flowering control for hybrid seed production, seedling vigor, plant size, internode number and distance, root growth, seed size, fruit size, pod size, pod or ear number, seed number per pod or ear, seed mass, enhanced seed filling, reduced seed dispersal, reduced pod dehiscence and lodging resistance. Further yield traits include seed composition, such as carbohydrate content, protein content, oil content and composition, nutritional value, reduction in anti-nutritional compounds, improved processability and better storage stability. Plants that may be treated according to the invention are hybrid plants that already express the characteristic of heterosis or hybrid vigor which results in generally higher yield, vigor, health and resistance towards biotic and abiotic stresses). Such plants are typically made by crossing an inbred male-sterile parent line (the female parent) with another inbred male-fertile parent line (the male parent). Hybrid seed is typically harvested from the male sterile plants and sold to growers. Male sterile plants can sometimes (e.g. in corn) be produced by detasseling, i.e. the mechanical removal of the male reproductive organs (or males flowers) but, more typically, male sterility is the result of genetic determinants in the plant genome. In that case, and especially when seed is the desired product to be harvested from the hybrid plants it is typically useful to ensure that male fertility in the hybrid plants is fully restored. This can be accomplished by ensuring that the male parents have appropriate fertility restorer genes which are capable of restoring the male fertility in hybrid plants that contain the genetic determinants responsible for male-sterility. Genetic determinants for male sterility may be located in the cytoplasm. Examples of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) were for instance described in Brassica species (WO 92/05251, WO 95/09910, WO 98/27806, WO 05/002324, WO 06/021972 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,229,072). However, genetic determinants for male sterility can also be located in the nuclear genome. Male sterile plants can also be obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering. A particularly useful means of obtaining male-sterile plants is described in WO 89/10396 in which, for example, a ribonuclease such as barnase is selectively expressed in the tapetum cells in the stamens. Fertility can then be restored by expression in the tapetum cells of a ribonuclease inhibitor such as barstar (e.g. WO 91/02069). Plants or plant cultivars (obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering) which may be treated according to the invention are herbicide-tolerant plants, i.e. plants made tolerant to one or more given herbicides. Such plants can be obtained either by genetic transformation, or by selection of plants containing a mutation imparting such herbicide tolerance. Herbicide-resistant plants are for example glyphosate-tolerant plants, i.e. plants made tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate or salts thereof. Plants can be made tolerant to glyphosate through different means. For example, glyphosate-tolerant plants can be obtained by transforming the plant with a gene encoding the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). Examples of such EPSPS genes are the AroA gene (mutant CT7) of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium (Science 1983, 221, 370-371), the CP4 gene of the bacterium Agrobacterium sp. (Curr. Topics Plant Physiol. 1992, 7, 139-145), the genes encoding a Petunia EPSPS (Science 1986, 233, 478-481), a Tomato EPSPS (J. Biol. Chem. 1988, 263, 4280-4289), or an Eleusine EPSPS (WO 01/66704). It can also be a mutated EPSPS as described in for example EP 0837944, WO 00/66746, WO 00/66747 or WO 02/26995. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by expressing a gene that encodes a glyphosate oxido-reductase enzyme as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,760 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,463,175. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by expressing a gene that encodes a glyphosate acetyl transferase enzyme as described in for example WO 02/036782, WO 03/092360, WO 2005/012515 and WO 2007/024782. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by selecting plants containing naturally-occurring mutations of the above-mentioned genes, as described in for example WO 01/024615 or WO 03/013226. Plants expressing EPSPS genes that confer glyphosate tolerance are described in e.g. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/517,991, 10/739,610, 12/139,408, 12/352,532, 11/312,866, 11/315,678, 12/421,292, 11/400,598, 11/651,752, 11/681,285, 11/605,824, 12/468,205, 11/760,570, 11/762,526, 11/769,327, 11/769,255, 11/943801 or 12/362,774. Plants comprising other genes that confer glyphosate tolerance, such as decarboxylase genes, are described in e.g. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/588,811, 11/185,342, 12/364,724, 11/185,560 or 12/423,926. Other herbicide resistant plants are for example plants that are made tolerant to herbicides inhibiting the enzyme glutamine synthase, such as bialaphos, phosphinothricin or glufosinate. Such plants can be obtained by expressing an enzyme detoxifying the herbicide or a mutant glutamine synthase enzyme that is resistant to inhibition, e.g. described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/760,602. One such efficient detoxifying enzyme is an enzyme encoding a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (such as the bar or pat protein from Streptomyces species). Plants expressing an exogenous phosphinothricin acetyltransferase are for example described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,561,236; 5,648,477; 5,646,024; 5,273,894; 5,637,489; 5,276,268; 5,739,082; 5,908,810 and 7,112,665. Further herbicide-tolerant plants are also plants that are made tolerant to the herbicides inhibiting the enzyme hydroxyphenylpyruvatedioxygenase (HPPD). HPPD is an enzyme that catalyze the reaction in which para-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) is transformed into homogentisate. Plants tolerant to HPPD-inhibitors can be transformed with a gene encoding a naturally-occurring resistant HPPD enzyme, or a gene encoding a mutated or chimeric HPPD enzyme as described in WO 96/38567, WO 99/24585, WO 99/24586, WO 09/144079, WO 02/046387, or U.S. Pat. No. 6,768,044. Tolerance to HPPD-inhibitors can also be obtained by transforming plants with genes encoding certain enzymes enabling the formation of homogentisate despite the inhibition of the native HPPD enzyme by the HPPD-inhibitor. Such plants and genes are described in WO 99/34008 and WO 02/36787. Tolerance of plants to HPPD inhibitors can also be improved by transforming plants with a gene encoding an enzyme having prephenate deshydrogenase (PDH) activity in addition to a gene encoding an HPPD-tolerant enzyme, as described in WO 04/024928. Further, plants can be made more tolerant to HPPD-inhibitor herbicides by adding into their genome a gene encoding an enzyme capable of metabolizing or degrading HPPD inhibitors, such as the CYP450 enzymes shown in WO 2007/103567 and WO 2008/150473. Still further herbicide resistant plants are plants that are made tolerant to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors. Known ALS-inhibitors include, for example, sulfonylurea, imidazolinone, triazolopyrimidines, pryimidinyoxy(thio)benzoates, and/or sulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinone herbicides. Different mutations in the ALS enzyme (also known as acetohydroxyacid synthase, AHAS) are known to confer tolerance to different herbicides and groups of herbicides, as described for example in Tranel and Wright (Weed Science 2002, 50, 700-712), but also, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,011, 5,378,824, 5,141,870, and 5,013,659. The production of sulfonylurea-tolerant plants and imidazolinone-tolerant plants is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,011; 5,013,659; 5,141,870; 5,767,361; 5,731,180; 5,304,732; 4,761,373; 5,331,107; 5,928,937; and 5,378,824; and WO 96/33270. Other imidazolinone-tolerant plants are also described in for example WO 2004/040012, WO 2004/106529, WO 2005/020673, WO 2005/093093, WO 2006/007373, WO 2006/015376, WO 2006/024351, and WO 2006/060634. Further sulfonylurea- and imidazolinone-tolerant plants are also described in for example WO 2007/024782 and U.S. Patent Application 61/288,958. Other plants tolerant to imidazolinone and/or sulfonylurea can be obtained by induced mutagenesis, selection in cell cultures in the presence of the herbicide or mutation breeding as described for example for soybeans in U.S. Pat. No. 5,084,082, for rice in WO 97/41218, for sugar beet in U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,702 and WO 99/057965, for lettuce in U.S. Pat. No. 5,198,599, or for sunflower in WO 01/065922. Plants or plant cultivars (obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering) which may also be treated according to the invention are insect-resistant transgenic plants, i.e. plants made resistant to attack by certain target insects. Such plants can be obtained by genetic transformation, or by selection of plants containing a mutation imparting such insect resistance. An “insect-resistant transgenic plant”, as used herein, includes any plant containing at least one transgene comprising a coding sequence encoding: 1) an insecticidal crystal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis or an insecticidal portion thereof, such as the insecticidal crystal proteins listed by Crickmore et al. (1998, Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, 62: 807-813), updated by Crickmore et al. (2005) at the Bacillus thuringiensis toxin nomenclature, online at: http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/Home/Neil_Crickmore/Bt/), or insecticidal portions thereof, e.g., proteins of the Cry protein classes Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1B, Cry1C, Cry1D, Cry1F, Cry2Ab, Cry3Aa, or Cry3Bb or insecticidal portions thereof (e.g. EP-A 1 999 141 and WO 2007/107302), or such proteins encoded by synthetic genes as e.g. described in and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/249,016; or 2) a crystal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis or a portion thereof which is insecticidal in the presence of a second other crystal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis or a portion thereof, such as the binary toxin made up of the Cry34 and Cry35 crystal proteins (Nat.

The application rate of the inventive active ingredients is in the case of treatment of plant parts, for example leaves: from 0.1 to 10 000 g/ha, preferably from 10 to 1000 g/ha, more preferably from 10 to 800 g/ha, even more preferably from 50 to 300 g/ha (in the case of application by watering or dripping, it is even possible to reduce the application rate, especially when inert substrates such as rockwool or perlite are used);in the case of seed treatment: from 2 to 200 g per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 3 to 150 g per 100 kg of seed, more preferably from 2.5 to 25 g per 100 kg of seed, even more preferably from 2.5 to 12.5 g per 100 kg of seed;in the case of soil treatment: from 0.1 to 10 000 g/ha, preferably from 1 to 5000 g/ha. These application rates are merely by way of example and are not limiting for the purposes of the invention. The inventive compositions can thus be used to protect plants from attack by the pathogens mentioned for a certain period of time after treatment. The period for which protection is provided extends generally for 1 to 28 days, preferably for 1 to 14 days, more preferably for 1 to 10 days, most preferably for 1 to 7 days, after the treatment of the plants with the active ingredients, or for up to 200 days after a seed treatment. The method of treatment according to the invention also provides the use or application of compounds (A) and (B) and/or (C) in a simultaneous, separate or sequential manner. If the single active ingredients are applied in a sequential manner, i.e. at different times, they are applied one after the other within a reasonably short period, such as a few hours or days. Preferably the order of applying the compounds (A) and (B) and/or (C) is not essential for working the present invention. The plants listed can particularly advantageously be treated in accordance with the invention with the compounds of the general formula (I) and the inventive compositions. The preferred ranges stated above for the active ingredients or compositions also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or compositions specifically mentioned in the present text. The advanced fungicidal activity of the active compound combinations according to the invention is evident from the example below. While the individual active compounds exhibit weaknesses with regard to the fungicidal activity, the combinations have an activity which exceeds a simple addition of activities. A synergistic effect of fungicides is always present when the fungicidal activity of the active compound combinations exceeds the total of the activities of the active compounds when applied individually. The expected activity for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows (cf. Colby, S. R., “Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations”, Weeds 1967, 15, 20-22): If X is the efficacy when active compound A is applied at an application rate of m ppm (or g/ha),Y is the efficacy when active compound B is applied at an application rate of n ppm (or g/ha),E is the efficacy when the active compounds A and B are applied at application rates of m and n ppm (or g/ha), respectively, and then E = X + Y - X · Y 100 The degree of efficacy, expressed in % is denoted. 0% means an efficacy which corresponds to that of the control while an efficacy of 100% means that no disease is observed. If the actual fungicidal activity exceeds the calculated value, then the activity of the combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect exists. In this case, the efficacy which was actually observed must be greater than the value for the expected efficacy (E) calculated from the abovementioned formula. A further way of demonstrating a synergistic effect is the method of Tammes (cf. “Isoboles, a graphic representation of synergism in pesticides” in Neth. J. Plant Path., 1964, 70, 73-80). The invention is illustrated by the following examples. However the invention is not limited to the examples. EXAMPLE 1 Alternaria Test (Tomatoes)/Preventive Solvent: 24.5 parts by weight of acetone 24.5 parts by weight of dimethylacetamide Emulsifier: 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amounts of solvent and emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration. To test for preventive activity, young plants are sprayed with the preparation of active compound at the stated rate of application. After the spray coating has dried on, the plants are inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of Alternaria solani. The plants are then placed in an incubation cabinet at approximately 20° C. and a relative atmospheric humidity of 100%. The test is evaluated 3 days after the inoculation. 0% means an efficacy which corresponds to that of the untreated control while an efficacy of 100% means that no disease is observed. the untreated control, while an efficacy of 100% means that no disease is observed. The table below clearly shows that the observed activity of the active compound combination according to the invention is greater than the calculated activity, i.e. a synergistic effect is present.
