In several embodiments, the topical composition comprises one or more Bulbine, Centella, and glycosides. In one embodiment, the invention comprises a gel medicament for topical application to damaged skin, said medicament comprising, consisting or consisting essentially of an extract of bulbine frutescens in an amount from about 9% to about 11% mass per mass of the medicament, an extract of Centella asiatica in an amount from about 0.1% to about 2% mass per mass of the medicament, a phenol (e.g., oleuropein) extracted from a source selected from the group consisting of olive leaf and olive oil in an amount from about 0.18% to about 0.3% mass per volume of the medicament, dimethicone, water, and one or more of the following: propylene glycol, glycerol-polyethylene glycol oxystearate, poloxamer, and phenoxyethanol. Phosphatidylserine is included in some embodiments. In several embodiments of the invention, a method for treating damaged skin is provided. In one embodiment, the method comprises identifying damaged skin and applying a topical composition to said damaged skin, wherein application of said topical composition treats said damaged skin. The topical composition may comprise any of the various embodiments described herein, and in one embodiment, includes one or more extracts of Bulbine frutescens, one or more extracts of Centella asiatica, oleuropein (and/or other olive-related compound), and optionally one or more silicones. Anti-aging ingredients may be included in several embodiments. In several embodiments, the damaged skin is damaged by a wound, a scar, acne, inflammation, stretching of skin (such as with pregnancy, surgery, or weight gain), or aging. In one embodiment, the wound is produced during a surgical procedure. In one embodiment, the application of the composition to the damaged skin reduces inflammation. In one embodiment, the topical application of the composition to the damaged skin unexpectedly produces an occlusive dressing without the use of microporous tape. In one embodiment, the composition facilitates formation of a barrier that protects the damaged skin from environmental influences and provides support for the damaged skin. In several embodiments, the beneficial combination of Bulbine, Centella and oleuropein (and/or other olive-related compound) works synergistically, and has several advantages over a combination of Bulbine and Centella alone. In several embodiments, the invention comprises a topical composition for the treatment of damaged skin, comprising one or more extracts of Bulbine frutescens, one or more extracts of Centella asiatica, one or more olive extracts, and, optionally, one or more silicones. The olive extract comprises oleuropein in one embodiment. The silicone may comprise dimethicone. In one embodiment, extracts of Bulbine frutescens are provided in a range of about 0.25% to about 25% mass per mass of the topical composition, extracts of Centella asiatica are provided in a range of about 0.1% to about 10% mass per mass of the topical composition, and olive extracts are provided in a range of about 0.1% to about 5% mass per volume of the topical composition. In several embodiments, the topical composition is in the form of a gel, cream or ointment. In one embodiment, the topical composition further comprises at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of water, a solvent, a preservative, a surfactant, a gelling agent, and a pH balancer.

In one embodiment, the topical composition includes phosphatidylserine. In several embodiments, the topical composition is used to treat damaged skin. Damaged skin includes, but is not limited to, wounded skin, scarred skin, and aging skin. Damaged skin may have age spots, stretch marks, wrinkles, or combinations thereof. Damaged skin may exhibit laxity. In some embodiments, the topical compositions described herein are used without the use of microporous tape or other support structure. In one embodiment, the topical compositions are sufficiently viscous or sticky to produce an occlusive dressing without a support structure. In several embodiments, a topical composition is applied beneath a support structure (e.g., tape). In other embodiments, a topical composition is applied on top of a support structure (e.g., tape). In one embodiment, the tape is a microporous tape that is designed to accept the topical composition on the outer surface of the tape and deliver the topical composition in contact with the damaged skin through, for examples, pores or other conduits. In yet other embodiments, a user is instructed to apply a topical composition both below and on top of a support structure (e.g., tape). In several embodiments, the topical compositions are provided in a delivery device (such as a multi-chambered device) that separates one or more ingredients from other ingredients. For example, the Bulbine, Centella, olive extracts and/or silicone may be separated from one or more additional ingredients in a dual-chambered device. The topical compositions may be applied daily or on an as needed basis. Individual ingredients may be applied either simultaneously or sequentially. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Several embodiments of the invention comprise an effective composition for preventing skin damage and for treating skin that has already been damaged. Damaged skin includes scars, photoaged skin, inflamed skin, acne, burns, wounds, age spots, stretch marks, wrinkles, dull skin, pores, hyperpigmentation, and hypopigmentation. In several embodiments, the topical composition comprises one or more extracts of Bulbine frutescens, Centella asiatica, olive extract (e.g., olive oil, olive leaf extract) and, optionally, one or more silicones. Anti-aging ingredients, such other plant extracts, phospholipids, vitamins, minerals, peptides, amino acids, growth factors, essential oils, and stem cells are further included in several embodiments. Bulbine In several embodiments, the invention comprises one or more extracts of Bulbine. Extracts may be obtained from any part of the plant, including the leaves, stems, flowers, fruits, bark, and roots. Bulbine frutescens is a common garden plant that is native to South Africa. In several embodiments of the invention, the use of Bulbine frutescens is particularly advantageous because of its hydrating properties. In several embodiments, one or more glycoproteins from Bulbine frutescens are sufficiently large to remain on the surface of the skin long enough to produce effective hydration of the skin. Additionally, in some embodiments, the extracts (e.g., peptides or other compounds) of Bulbine frutescens have decorin-like effects on wound healing, and improve mature collagen deposition in healing wounds. In some embodiments, compositions comprising Bulbine are especially effective because one or more polypeptides mimic the effect of decorin and rearrange collagen in a uniform manner during the process of fibrillogenesis and collagen regeneration. In some embodiments, the use of Bulbine, Centella, and olive extracts (e.g., Bulbine frutescens, Centella asiatica, and oleuropein) is effective in modulating, uniformly arranging, and maturing collagen during the process of healing. Thus, in some embodiments, the topical composition not only stimulates new collagen formation, but packages the new fibres in a uniform and structured manner. In one embodiment, the topical compositions disclosed herein contain agents that affect decorin activity or mimic decorin to facilitate collagen remodeling and structural arrangement. Centella Centella asiatica is a small herbaceous annual plant. Extracts, such as asiaticosides, asiatic acid and triterpenes, may be obtained from any part of the plant, including the leaves, stems, flowers, fruits, bark, and roots. In several embodiments, the invention comprises one or more extracts of Centella asiatica, or other Centella species. In one embodiment, Centella asiatica is used to decrease inflammation, stimulate type 1 collagen production, and/or act as anti-oxidant. In one embodiment, compositions comprising Centella are used in scar management. In some cases, the more quickly a scar matures the less chance there is of hypertrophy. Collagen maturation goes through phases with collagen type III being present in greater levels in the early scarring phase. As the scar matures the ratio of type III to type I returns to normal levels. Thus, in several embodiments, the invention comprises one or more ingredients that encourages type I collagen formation. In some embodiments, one or more extracts of Centella asiatica increase levels of mature collagen and facilitate normalization of collagen ratios. In several embodiments, purified extracts (triterpenic fractions, including asiaticoside and other saponins) of the Centella plant are used. TGFβ is the prototype of a protein superfamily that has been recognised as a fibroproliferative and collagen stimulating agent involved in excess scarring (particularly TGF-β1). Many isoforms of the protein exist with most isoforms sharing the same fibroproliferative properties. One isoform, TGF-β3 however, appears to have a protective effect against excess collagen formation counteracting the TGF-β1 effects. According to one embodiment, asiaticoside can down-regulate TGF-β1 mRNA and TIMP1 expressions and upregulate TGF-β3 mRNA expression in post burn hypertrophic scars, and is also capable of decomposing the products of type I collagen, contributing to the reduction of hypertrophic scar formation. Thus, in several embodiments, the invention comprises one or more agents (such as asiaticoside) to modulate TGFβ activity. Olive Extracts In several embodiments, the invention comprises one or more extracts of olive (e.g., olive oil, olive leaf extract, etc.). Extracts include, in several embodiments, phenolic compounds. Extracts, which may or may not be in the form of oil (or derived from an oil), may be obtained from any part of the olive tree including the leaves, stems, flowers, fruits, bark, and roots. In one embodiment, the invention comprises, consists essentially of or consists of Bulbine, Centella and an olive extract (e.g., oleuropein). In one embodiment, oleuropein and other agents may be extracted from the leaves of the olive tree. In some embodiments, engineered or synthesized phenols may be used in the compositions described herein. In some embodiments, oleuropein and/or additional constituents provide for a multimodality approach to scar management covering all phases of the wound healing cascade. For example, for certain scar applications, an important physiologic response to wounding is that of inflammation. Inflammation can also be one of the most destructive: over exuberant inflammation is thought to be cause of most chronic arthritic conditions, heart disease, and chronic wound pathogenesis. Along the physiologic path to scar formation, excess inflammation will result in an exaggerated scar. Suture materials are frequently associated with this phenomenon. On the other hand, controlled inflammation may speed up the process of scar maturation with minimal fibrosis. Thus, in several embodiments, the invention provides a therapeutic balance by facilitating controlled inflammation (e.g., by achieving a balance between no inflammation and excess inflammation). Thus, surprisingly, in several embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein maintain a certain amount of inflammation to ensure optimal healing. Phenols (e.g., oleuropein, oleocanthal) extracted from olives have known anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. In several embodiments, the invention comprises low doses of one or more phenols (whether extracted from the olive plant or not) in combination with Bulbine frutescens and Centella asiatica such that helpful inflammation is unaffected, whereas exuberant inflammation, typical of foreign body reactions, is down-regulated or modulated. In some embodiments, the invention comprises one or more Bulbine, Centella, and glycosides (including, but not limited to, oleuropein). In several embodiments of the invention, the topical compositions described herein include one or more extracts of olive, which are used to achieve controlled inflammation. It is well-accepted that ongoing inflammation retards wound healing. This is especially important in chronic non-healing wounds where proteases and reactive oxygen metabolites are responsible for much on the ongoing damage, antiproliferative effects, and non-healing seen in these wounds. The negative effects of exuberant inflammation are not limited to chronic wounds: in acute wounds low-grade ongoing inflammation results in increased matrixmetalloproteinase and cytokine elaboration (especially TGF-β1 and 2, Il-1,6,8) and a profibrotic state with a resultant exaggerated scar. This inflammation can be initiated by tension on the scar, foreign material (long-standing subcuticular sutures), bacteria, biofilm, and many other scenarios. Thus, control of inflammation during the healing phase is a desired goal of several embodiments of the invention. In several embodiments of the invention, at least one olive extract is provided. Olive extracts, such as olive oil (e.g., newly pressed extra-virgin olive oil) and extracts of olive leaf, contain phenolic compounds (oleocanthal, oleuropein) that act as a natural anti-inflammatory compound that has a potency and profile strikingly similar to that of ibuprofen, without the undesired side effects. Although structurally dissimilar, both these molecules inhibit the same cyclo-oxygenase enzymes in the prostaglandin-biosynthesis pathway. According to several embodiments, this anti-inflammatory effect has important implications for scar control. Thus, in several embodiments, the topical composition inhibits cyclo-oxygenase enzymes. In several embodiments, olive extracts include one or more of the following: hydroxytyrosol, oleocanthal, oleuropein, rutin, apigenin, and luteolin. In several embodiments, olive extracts are used to stimulate proteasome function and promote normal fibroblast (reverses senescence) activity with formation of new collagen. Proteasomes “mop up” fragmented protein particles including fragmented collagen, thereby minimizing the formation of undesired clumped collagen. Silicone In several embodiments, the invention comprises one or more silicones. In some embodiments, the invention comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of one or more extracts of Bulbine, Centella, phenols or an olive extract, and silicone. Silicones include, but are not limited to dimethicone and cyclomethicones. In one embodiment, the silicone is either in the form of sheeting or a gel. In one embodiment, the silicone, when used in conjunction with Bulbine frutescens and Centella asiatica, provides a synergistic complement to the action of Bulbine frutescens as a hydrating agent. In one embodiment, dimethicone is added to the mix as an extremely efficient hydrating agent complementing the action of Bulbine frutescens. In some embodiments, the addition of an olive extract with silicone results in a beneficial sticky barrier. Normal skin has a mature stratum corneum characterised by minimal transepidermal water loss. Dehydration of the stratum corneum initiates signaling to keratinocytes. These keratinocytes are stimulated to produce cytokines which activate dermal fibroblasts to synthesize and release collagen. Excessive collagen production may lead to abnormal scarring. In one embodiment of the invention, silicone is provided as an effective barrier to water loss and stratum corneum breach. Silicone may be provided in the form of sheeting, gels (e.g., dimethicone), or other appropriate forms. Phosphatidlyserine In several embodiments, the topical compositions comprise phosphatidylserine. In the context of collagen modulation, particularly when considering anti-aging intervention, the Bulbine, Centella, an olive extract (e.g., oleuropein), and optionally silicone, may be used in conjunction with phosphatidylserine. In one embodiment, phosphatidylserine stimulates the formation of procollagen, a collagen precursor. This new collagen is then acted on by the combination of Bulbine, Centella, and olive extract(s), and/or other optional ingredients, to induce maturation of the collagen. In one embodiment, this sequence has important synergistic anti-aging benefits in several embodiments. In one embodiment, phosphatidylserine also decreases matrixmetallproteinase 1 (MMP1) levels which promotes collagen and extracellular matrix breakdown characteristic of photodamaged skin. It then stimulates the formation of new collagen by promoting procollagen formation. Examples of Additional Ingredients & Ranges In several embodiments, the topical compositions comprise one or more additional ingredients. These additional ingredients, along with Bulbine, Centella, olive extracts, silicone, and phosphatidylserine, are provided in a range of about 0.1% to about 50%, or higher, according to several embodiments (e.g., 0.1%-1%, 1%-2%, 2%-5%, 5%-10%, 10%-25%, 25%-50%, and overlapping ranges thereof). As with other percentages disclosed herein, these percentages may be mass per mass, mass to volume, or volume to volume with respect to the total composition.

These amounts may be the weight of the ingredient per individual application (or dose), per unit or per container (tube, bottle, jar, etc.). Individual applications may be made hourly, 1-10 times per day, weekly, or as needed. For example, in some embodiments, one or more of the following ingredients are included, along with extracts of Bulbine, Centella, olive, and optionally silicone and/or phosphatidylserine: other plant extracts and vitamins or provitamins for the purpose of formulating a comprehensive cosmetic skin maintenance range achieving cleansing, moisturizing, healing, toning, hydrating, and protecting the skin.

In several embodiments, the topical compositions disclosed herein comprise antioxidants. In one embodiment, antioxidants are useful for modulating appropriate collagen crosslinking. Linkages need to be susceptible to MMP breakdown to ensure balanced degradation and neosynthesis. Pyridinoline crosslinks, not normally seen in skin, may be undesired because they are able to withstand major force and tend to be resistant to MMP-1 degradation. This pyridinoline phenomenon has been linked to oxygen radical activity (especially in burns); thus, antioxidants appear to be beneficial in potential scar reduction according to several embodiments. Antioxidants useful in several embodiments include, but are not limited to, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, ascorbic acid, and tocopherol. In several embodiments, extracts of Centella asiatica and olive (e.g., oleuropein) are used as antioxidants.

For example, in one embodiment, the amount of Centella asiatica is provided in the range of between about 0.1% and 0.25% to produce a milder medicament where the goal is texture modification, e.g. when treating skin that is damaged as a result of aging or damage by excessive exposure to ultra violet light, or when preventing damage. In one embodiment, the oleuropein content will be reduced by a factor of ten (to e.g., 0.018 to 0.03% mass to volume of the final preparation of the topical composition) for use as a cosmetic. In many embodiments, higher concentrations of Centella extracts are used, even for preventative or daily cosmetic uses. In several embodiments, the topical composition may comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of two or more of the following ingredients: 0.10-5.0% Centella Asiatica extract, 0.25-5.0% Bulbine Frutescens extract, 0.10-0.50% of a phenol extracted from an olive extract (e.g., oleuropein), and 0.10-5.0% phosphatidylserine. In alternative embodiments, the topical composition may also comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of one or more of the following ingredients listed on Table 1 in addition to, or instead of, the ingredients listed above: TABLE 1 Pyridoxine Tris-Hexyldecanoate - 0.25-5.0% Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate - 0.25-5.0% Niacinamide - 0.50%-5.0% Hexapeptide-10 - 0.0001-1.0% (pure peptide basis) Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester - 0.0001-1.0% (pure peptide basis) Tocotrienol - 0.05-3.0% Dipalmitoyl Hydroxyproline - 0.20-5.0% Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5 - 0.0001-1.0% (pure peptide basis) Pamitoyl Oligopeptide - 0.0001-1.0% (pure peptide basis) Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7 - 0.0001-1.0% (pure peptide basis) Palmitoyl Dipeptide-5 Diaminobutyroyl Hydroxythreonine - 0.0001-1.0% (pure peptide basis) Palmitoyl Dipeptide-5 Diaminohydroxybutyrate - 0.0001-1.0% (pure peptide basis) Siegesbeckia Orientalis Extract - 0.25-5.0% Rabdosia Rubescens Extract - 0.25-5.0% Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Water v 0.25-5.0% Sophora Angustifolia Root Extract - 0.25-5.0% Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil - 0.25-5.0% Lupinus Albus Seed Extract - 0.25-5.0% Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein - 0.25-5.0% Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract - 0.25-5.0% Artemia Extract - 0.25-5.0% Hydrolyzed Rice Extract - 0.25-5.0% Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Extract - 0.25-5.0% Blackberry Leaf Extract - 0.25-5.0% Pichia pastoris Ferment Extract - 1.0-25% Pichia pastoris/Resveratrol Ferment Extract - 0.50-5.0% Xylitylglucoside - 0.10-5.0% Anhydroxylitol - 0.10-5.0% Xylitol - 0.10-5.0% L-Carnosine - 0.10-5.0% In further embodiments, the composition comprises some or all of the following ingredients: aqua; bulbine frutescens, caprylic/capric triglyceride, glycerin, stearic acid, d-panthenol, cetearyl alcohol, lanolin oil, phosphatidylserine, cetyl phosphate; tocopheryl acetate; cetearyl ethylhexanoate, isopropyl myristate, sodium polyacrylate, mineral oil, trideceth-6, triterpenic glycosides of Centella asiatica, alpha bisabolol; phenoxyethanol, potassium hydroxide, xanthan gum, oleuropein, methylhydroxybenzoate, butylated hydroxy toluene; fragrance, and retinyl palmitate.

Maceration, cold-pressing, solvent extraction, and distillation, or combinations therefore, are used in some embodiments. In one embodiment, extracts of olive leaf are produced by extracting in ethanol, drying, and sifting through, for example, a 25 mesh screen. In one embodiment, bulbine leaves are expressed and filtered to produce an extract. In one embodiment, Centella is extracted in water and alcohol and sifted through, for example, an 80 mesh screen. In some embodiments, further isolation and purification steps are used. Examples of Forms, Tapes and Support Structures Several embodiments of the topical compositions described herein can be in the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, gel, spray, aerosol, powder, oil, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the invention comprises a device that compartmentalizes the ingredients until time of application. For example, in one embodiment, one or more ingredients are separated from other ingredients until a user combines them. In some embodiments, a dual chamber or multi-chamber device is used to hold and/or apply the topical composition. In one embodiment, the invention comprises a kit that includes extracts of Centella asiatica, Bulbine frutescens, olive, and silicone. In other embodiments, the compositions described herein can be provided on a patch for e.g., controlled time release. In yet other embodiments, the compositions described herein can be formulated into capsules, tinctures or other forms for oral consumption (e.g., compositions comprising extracts of Bulbine, Centella, olive, and/or phosphatidylserine, and optionally other plant extracts and vitamins), and may be particularly well-suited in a nutraceutical regime that is combined with a topical skin care plan. In one embodiment, a topical application to minimize scarring comprising support, hydration, collagen maturation and controlled inflammation is provided. In one embodiment, a tape or other support structure (e.g., bandage, patch. etc.) is applied to a wound or scar. Supporting a scar, particularly a long scar, in areas where vector forces continually pull on the scar, is provided in some embodiments. For example, in the presternal chest area, forces may be generated on the scar from neck movements, shoulder movements, arm movements and additionally from the weight of breasts in some women. The direct response to such vector forces is increased production of collagen in an effort to keep the wound closed. Thus, in some embodiments, a tape may be particularly helpful in scar treatment. In some embodiments, using agents such as Vitamin E (especially when used early) can cause major skin sensitivities and have a collagenase-like effect, which weakens the scar and can have adverse consequences with stretching and even opening of the scars. Thus in embodiment of the invention, the composition does not include Vitamin E and/or any agent having collagenase-like activity. In one embodiment, a scar support comprising a microporous tape is provided. In one embodiment, the tape is applied longitudinally along the scar path and not at right angles to facilitate consistent support. In one embodiment, the tape is left in place for days until it spontaneously separates. Premature removal may result in skin stripping which sets up inflammation with negative consequences on the scar. Although small areas of scars may not need support, some small scars do very well with support. For example, cuts on fingers are continually stressed with forces, and thus applying a single layer of microporous tape supports the scar, avoids maceration as seen with common plasters, and allows the application of additional agents to the tape surface to speed up the maturation process. In one embodiment, the tape comprises thin layers that can be applied over one another, thereby obviating the need to remove the tape. In one embodiment, one or more layers are dissolvable. Support structures (such as tape), according to several embodiments, comprise polyethylene, hydrogel, silicones, cotton, silk, polyester, fabric, foam, plastic, elastic, various adhesives, collagen, etc. and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, a tape (or other support structure) is applied to the length of the scar and the topical composition is applied to the tape. The application of the tape and gel may be commenced as soon as convenient after the wound has been formed. In one embodiment, the tape is a microporous tape that permits contact of the topical composition with the skin when the topical composition is applied over the tape. In some embodiments, the topical composition is applied to the skin before the tape is placed. In that situation, the tape may be porous or not. In some embodiments, the topical composition comprising extracts of Bulbine, Centella, olive, and silicone achieves a short-term sticky consistency that works synergistically with the tape. In one embodiment, the tape saturated with the topical composition (e.g., gel) adheres to the wound more effectively than previous formulations. In one embodiment, a user is instructed to use a tape (or other support structure) and keep the tape in place during bathing. The tape need only be replaced once spontaneous separation takes place (e.g., 3-5 days). Gel may be applied to the surface of the tape twice a day and the routine is continued until scar maturation (e.g., white color) takes place. In one embodiment, the tape component may be stopped anywhere from six weeks of application if the scar is seen to be maturing well, and gel is then applied directly to the scar. In one embodiment, the topical compositions described herein is effective within 6 weeks of using the tape, as compared to longer periods (e.g., 6 months) of using the tape with other compositions. In one embodiment, the topical composition (e.g., gel) is used under the support structure (e.g., tape). For example, gel may be applied as a “worm-like” application to the surface of a scar or wound, not massaged, and covered completely by the tape which overlaps non-affected skin on all sides ensuring adhesiveness. The user may bathe with tape and gel in place, and after approximately three days, the tape may be removed (e.g., while bathing). Subsequently, the scar or wound is washed and the gel re-applied and then covered with new tape. The user is instructed to continue this treatment until the color of damaged skin whitens. In a further embodiment, the topical composition (e.g., gel) may be applied as a narrow thin film-like application directly and limited to the scar surface keeping surrounding areas free from gel ensuring good adhesion of tape to the gel applied scar surface. This routine is repeated at every dressing/tape change. The user may bathe with tape and gel in place, and after approximately three days, the tape may be removed (e.g., while bathing). Subsequently, the scar or wound is washed and the gel re-applied and then covered with new tape. After 4-6 weeks, according to one embodiment, the tape application may be discontinued and the user is instructed to use the gel directly on the scar surface twice a day until scar maturation is observed by flattening and color change (pink to white color in white skin, dark black/brown to light/very light brown in darker skin). In a further embodiment, the topical composition (e.g., gel) may be applied directly to the scar surface twice a day after 2, 3, or 4 weeks of supportive tape therapy. In several embodiments, a tape or other support structure is not needed to treat a scar because the consistency of the topical composition provides sufficient support. For example, in one embodiment, the topical composition heals with the formation of a barrier film that protects the scar from environmental influences and ensures a certain amount of support to the scar. In one embodiment, the topical composition forms a thin film or crust when dry. This provides a certain amount of support to the scar and serves as a barrier from outside contamination, irritation from the sun, and cosmetics. Several embodiments of the topical composition described herein can advantageously be used without any tape or supporting structure because the synergic effect of the Bulbine, Centella, oleuropein and optionally silicone create a self-supporting barrier that does not require additional support. In several embodiments, a tape is not needed because non-scar conditions are treated, where support may not be needed. In some embodiments, physical stimulation, such as by massage, needle (derma) rollers, is also incorporated as part of the regime for treating damaged skin. In one embodiment, a pre-treatment is provided prior to application of the topical compositions described herein. The pre-treatment includes, but is not limited to, exfoliation, physical stimulation, and energy-based stimulation (e.g., light, radiofrequency, ultrasound, microwave, etc.). The pre-treatment may be helpful to increase the absorption of the topical composition and/or work synergistically with the topical composition. The pre-treatment modalities described herein may also be used during and/or post-treatment. Examples of Uses and Timing In one embodiment, the topical compositions disclosed herein are used for controlling scar outcome and are applied at the time of wounding when the trigger for the sequence of healing begins or as soon thereafter as possible. In one embodiment, the topical composition is effective on scars that are several weeks, months or years old. In one embodiment, the topical composition prevents undesirable scarring. In one embodiment, the topical composition reduces one or more of the following characteristics of a scar by at least 25%, 50%, or 75%, as compared to a wound that is not treated with the composition: scar roughness, intensity of color, scar elevation and/or scar size. In some embodiments, the topical compositions may be helpful with keloid scarring, although the etiology of keloid scarring are generally very different from non-keloid scarring, and formulation adjustments may be needed. In one embodiment, a method of treating a scar is provided, wherein the method comprises applying a topical composition disclosed herein to the scar at the time of provisional scar matrix formation to effect subsequent matrix dissolution and maturation. In one embodiment the treatment of the scar is commenced immediately following wound closure (e.g., at the time of surgery or injury), or within a day or two thereafter. In another embodiment, the wound is treated within 1-4 weeks of wound occurrence. In several embodiments, the invention comprises applying the topical composition to a scar that is weeks, months or years old to improve the appearance of the scar. In some embodiments, the topical compositions provided herein are applied to scars or other undesirable marks on the skin, such as cellulite, stretch marks, wrinkles or age spots to improve the appearance of same. In other embodiments, the topical composition prevents the occurrence of cellulite, stretch marks, wrinkles, or age spots, and may be used on healthy or non-damaged skin. In some embodiments, because of the effects on collagen, the topical compositions help with skin laxity and are useful for skin tightening. In several embodiments, the topical compositions provided herein are used to treat aged skin. In one embodiment, the treatment would be as follows: each morning a collagen booster such as phosphatidylserine (optionally combined with other ingredients, such as Bulbine for hydration) is applied to the skin together with an antioxidant and a sun protection cream. In the evening, the collagen booster (phosphatidylserine) is applied to the skin together with extracts of Bulbine, Centella, olive and optionally silicone and/or other ingredients. In one embodiment, a method of treating aged skin is provided, wherein the aged skin is characterized by a shortage of collagen and irregular collagen the fibrils of which are clumped or aggregated in nature. Young skin, on the other hand, is typically associated with uniform collagen fibers and good amounts of type 1 collagen. Several embodiments of the invention (i) stimulate of the formation of procollagen (e.g., because of the effect of the phosphatidylserine), (ii) stimulate of the formation of type 1 collagen (e.g., because of the centella asiatica), (iii) promote uniformly spaced collagen (e.g., due to the effect of the Bulbine frutescens), and/or (iv) mop up of free radicals that are associated with aging (e.g., due to the oleuropein and the Centella asiatica). In one embodiment, the invention comprises a method of reducing free radicals and matrixmetalloproteinases MMP, e.g., type 1, wherein the method comprises: identifying damaged skin, applying (or instructing application of) a topical composition described herein to said damaged skin, thereby reducing free radicals. In one embodiment, the invention comprises a method of increasing the formation of pro-collagen and/or type 1 collagen, wherein the method comprises: identifying damaged skin, applying (or instructing application of) a topical composition described herein to said damaged skin, thereby forming pro-collagen and/or type 1 collagen. In one embodiment, the invention comprises a method of promoting uniformly spaced collagen, wherein the method comprises: identifying damaged skin, applying (or instructing application of) a topical composition described herein to said damaged skin, thereby promoting uniformly spaced collagen. In one embodiment, the combination of Centella asiatica, Bulbine frutescens and oleuropein promote an increase in collagen and its sequential modulation to a well-structured form. In the context of collagen modulation, particularly when considering anti-aging intervention, the Centella extract, Bulbine extract, and oleuropein may be used in conjunction with phosphatidylserine, wherein the phosphatidylserine promotes the formation of procollagen, a collagen precursor and decreases the levels of MMP 1 which breaks down collagen and extracellular matrix components, characteristic of photodamage. This new collagen is then acted on by the combination of Centella extract, Bulbine extract, and oleuropein to induce maturation of the collagen. This embodiment of a topical composition acts synergistically to achieve important anti-aging benefits. In one embodiment, the combination of Centella extract, Bulbine extract, oleuropein and phosphatidylserine may be used as an adjunct to anti-acne treatment. In this embodiment, the topical composition is used to minimize the eventual scarring resultant from the acne. In one embodiment, the topical composition is used once the acute pustular phase of the acne is ending and the inflammatory phase has started. The topical composition (e.g., in gel form) is applied to the individual acne lesions to promote healing, decrease inflammation and improve the final outcome in terms of scarring. There may well be beneficial effects in the early pustular phases of acne due to the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects of oleuropein and the healing effects of Centella, Bulbine and olive extracts, but, in one embodiment, the main indication in patients with acne would be for its use in diminishing scarring. In several embodiments, the topical compositions described herein may be used to promote circulation and/or act as an anti-oxidant. Topical compositions according to several embodiments are useful in the treatment of dermal or subdermal infections. In one embodiment, varicose veins and/or spider veins are treated. In other embodiments, rosacea eczema, and/or psoriasis are treated. In several embodiments, use of the topical composition will reduce the scarring and pitting associated with chicken pox. In several embodiments, use of the topical composition is useful for insect bites and allergic reactions. In several embodiments, the compositions are used to treat burns. In several embodiments, such as burns, wounds or painful inflammation, the composition may additionally include or be administered with an analgesic (such as lidocaine, menthol, methyl salicylate, camphor, and/or capsaicin). In some embodiments, because pain-related neurotransmitters may generate fibrosis if they are continuously stimulated, the compositions disclosed herein comprise ingredients that reduce such neurotransmission. In one embodiment, sterols (e.g., plant sterols, β-sitosterols), flavonoids, alkaloids, etc. are provided to modulate neurotransmission to reduce pain and fibrosis. In one embodiment, the topical compositions disclosed herein are used before, during and/or following cosmetic surgery, or other surgery, to facilitate recovery and appearance. For example, the compositions disclosed herein may be used before, during or after chemical peels, laser resurfacing, energy-based aesthetic therapies (such as microwave, radiofrequency and ultrasound), filler injections, skin shavings, mole removals, biopsies and hair removal. Prior treatment with the topical composition may help prime the skin for later distress (e.g., due to a cosmetic procedure). In several embodiments, the topical compositions described herein are formulated as moisturizers, body washes, soap, lotions, serums, eye creams, gels, sunscreens, bronzers, powders, nail care, hair care, foundation, blush, lip color, eye color and other cosmetics. In several embodiments, the topical compositions provided herein are useful for inclusion in shampoos, conditioners, and other hair treatments. In several embodiments, most or all of the ingredients are natural or organic. In many embodiments, the ingredients are non-comedogenic. According to several embodiments, the present invention is primarily concerned with the treatment of human subjects, but the invention may also be carried out on non-human subjects, particularly mammalian subjects such as dogs, cats, livestock and horses for veterinary purposes. While subjects may be of any suitable age, the subjects are, in some embodiments, adult or geriatric subjects. In several embodiments, the topical compositions described herein have sub-dermal effects. In one embodiment, the topical compositions modulate signaling mechanisms that interconnect the many layers of the dermis with the outer epidermal layer. In one embodiment, the topical compositions described herein modulate surface keratinocytes, which in turn orchestrate and initiate signaling events. In one embodiment, the topical compositions, with or without a scar tape, exhibit one or more of the following effects: SMAD7 inhibition of signaling to TGF-β, connexin 43 antagonism, connective tissue growth factor targeting, anti-SMAD2/3/4 complex, decreasing cadherin activation, and myofibroblast phenotype induction inhibition. Several embodiments of the invention cause a decreased activation of keratinocyte signaling by mimicking stratum corneum function (hydration) resulting in decreased production of IL-1β (and probably other cytokines yet to be identified), increased production of antifibrotic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α clearing the extracellular matrix remnants and an increase in TGF-β3 via stimulation of the SMAD7 signaling mechanism. This may result in extracellular matrix remodeling with less inflammation, decreased collagen production, and balanced protease activity, collectively encouraging scar maturation. Several embodiments of the invention prevent hypertrophic scar formation by, for example, simultaneous stimulation of SMAD7 expression and activation of proteasome degradation of SMAD3/4 signals. In one embodiment, plant-based phenols or other olive extracts play a role in stimulation. In one embodiment, oleuropein stimulates proteasomes to mop up extracellular fragments. A short time (e.g., within an hour) after wounding, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme may be activated to synthesize prostaglandins. Metabolites and enzymes of the arachidonic acid cascade, including the COX-2 enzyme and its enzymatic product prostaglandin E2 may mediate the inflammatory response. Thus, several embodiments of the invention inhibit this inflammatory pathway, thereby reducing scar formation and/or treating damaged skin. Maturation of the inflammatory process may involve a progressive increase in TGF-β3. This growth factor isoform appears to be involved in cessation of matrix deposition. TGF-β3 reduces fibronectin and collagen deposition and is considered potently antifibrotic. Several embodiments of the invention modulate TGF-β3 levels. In one embodiment, Centella extracts increase TGF-β3 levels. In one embodiment, the topical compositions described herein contain other agents that modulate TGF-β3 activity, including recombinant TGF-β3. Several embodiments of the invention, including but not limited to compositions comprising Bulbine, Centella and phenolic compounds (e.g., olive extracts), exhibit one or more of the following effects: increase SMAD7, increase TGF-β3, decrease TGF-β1, decrease COX-2, increase proteasome activation, and display potent antioxidant effects, and provide synergistic treatment of scars and other damaged skin.

Several embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the following non-limiting examples. EXAMPLE 1 Sixty patients each having a scar following simple skin excisions formed part of this example. Thirty of the patients had their scars treated; thirty had their scars untreated (10 face, 10 limbs, 10 back in each group). The treated patients were each treated as will be described with one embodiment of a scar gel of the invention. The scar gel comprised the ingredients and percentages as set out in Table 3. TABLE 3 Description or Ingredient action in one embodiment Aqua dest Distilled water Poloxamer Gel Matrix Glycerol-polyethylene glycol Surfactant. Helps in collecting oil oxystearate droplets into aqueous gel matrix Propylene glycol Solvent Dimethicone Oil carrier; Silicone Oleuropein (olive leaf extract) Antiseptic properties (anti-fungal; anti bacterial and anti inflammatory Triterpenic fraction of Centella Reducer of Scar tissue This converts asiatica collagen III to collagen I Phenoxyethanol Preservative against fungi Methylhydroxy-benzoate Preservative against germs Lactic acid To bring acidity of the product to near skin pH which is lower than 5.5 Bulbine Frutescens For re-arranging collagen fibrils. Microporous tape Optional Support In one embodiment, the triterpenic fraction of Centella asiatica comprises 0.5% m/m of the medicament; the Bulbine Frutescens comprises 10.0% m/m of the medicament, and the oleuropein comprises 0.18% to 0.3 mass/volume of the medicament. Patients were randomized to receive either routine postoperative care with tape alone (bilateral cosmetic cases) (the untreated patients) or combined tape with topical scar gel or no treatment (routine for small skin excisions) (the treated patients). Where one side was treated, the side selected for treatment was also randomized (at the end of surgery, the nursing staff drew lots to choose the right or left side for treatment). All scars were assessed and photographed at follow-up at 1, 2, and 6 months following surgery. In contrast to known management programs, scar management was initiated in the treated patients immediately following surgery. For small local excisions of skin tumors, the wounds were left without a dressing on the face and gel was applied directly to the site and continued twice daily by the patient as long as desired and normally for the full six month period. In an effort to combine all recent recommendations for scar assessment, elements of different scales were incorporated into the assessment parameters. Thus, elements of the Vancouver Scar Scale were incorporated into the scale of morphologic features. Patient and observer assessment charts were also included in the assessments as previously recommended. The data were revised into a format compatible with the statistical program using SAS v9. Differences between treated and untreated patients were determined using the Kruskal/Wallis test with p<0.05 considered significant. In the patients there were no significant differences apparent one month after the operation, the scars were significantly improved after two months in the treated versus the untreated group. Over the six months the morphologic grading scores improved only in treated but not untreated patients. Scar thickness and regularity of the treated scars were rated as being significantly better than untreated scars, with scar stiffness reaching borderline significance. Observers rated scar vascularization, pigmentation, thickness, relief, and pliability of the scar. All these parameters were significantly improved (p<0.005) in treated patients compared with the parameters of untreated patients. Observers noted scar hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, and mixed (hypo/hyperpigmentation) scars in 16 of the treated patients (89%). This compared favorably (p=0.04) with the untreated patients in whom 14/23 (61%), 4/23, and 5/23 had hypo-, hyper-, and mixed pigmentation (hypo/hyperpigmentation) scars respectively. EXAMPLE II In another non-limiting example, twenty patients each patient with two excisions formed part of this study. Of the two excisions of each patient, one was treated and one untreated (10 back, 5 face, 5 limbs). On the back and limbs the site was covered with microporous tape. Scar gel was applied immediately following surgery on to the surface of the tape, saturating it and producing an occlusive type of dressing. Patients were instructed to apply scar gel to the surface of the tape twice a day morning and night. The scar assessment was as indicated above. In patients with two excisions where one was treated and the other not (Group 1) the differences in scar morphology became significantly apparent at 6 months. As with Example 1, the treated but not the untreated scars showed significant improvement over the 6 months. Observers rated scar vascularization, pigmentation, thickness, relief, and pliability of the scar. Except for the vascularization rating, all other parameters were significantly improved. EXAMPLE III Ten patients undergoing skin surgery were treated with the scar gel as set out in Table 3. The ten patients had 20 scars following bilateral breast surgery, one side treated with tape alone, one side treated with tape and gel (5 breast augmentations, 5 breast reductions). In patients to whom the gel was applied, the scar gel was applied liberally to the area prior to application of the dressing. The gel was not massaged in but was left on the surface to ensure a reasonable amount of gel on the scar surface while the dressing was left undisturbed for seven to ten days. In cases where the dressing was changed the following day (breast reduction procedures), scar gel was reapplied to the selected side. Following the dressing change after seven to ten days, patients continued with the program for three to six months until the scar was considered mature (nonsymptomatic, white). The scar assessment was as indicated above. Similar results were found for this group of breast augmentation and reduction patients. Treated scars showed significant morphologic improvement after two months with borderline significance at 1 and 6 months compared to the untreated scars (i.e. the scars treated by tape alone). Only treated scars showed significant improvement in itchiness, with scar stiffness, thickness, and regularity approaching significance. Observers rated scar vascularization, pigmentation, thickness, relief, and pliability of the scar. Vascularization and pigmentation were improved in treated scars with scar thickness, relief, and pliability reaching borderline significance. Early scar control starting at the time of wounding is new in the improvement of scar outcome. Thus although the application of the scar gel can be commenced from seven to fourteen days after surgery preferably the scar gel is applied at the time of initial dressing at the end of the surgical procedure or the following day after surgery and as an immediate and continued application to the wound for small local excisions of skin lesions was applied in all the Examples. Efficacy was particularly evident in the patients mentioned in Example III where those treated immediately with tape and scar gel had better outcomes in all parameters measured. EXAMPLE IV Thirty patients with varying cosmetic procedures with 50 scars all treated and compared with historical outcomes for hypertrophic scarring (10 breast augmentations, 10 breast reductions, 10 abdominoplasties). The scars were treated immediately after surgery with the scar gel mentioned in Table 3. The scar assessment was as indicated above. The results showed that these patients who underwent a variety of procedures and showed improvement in scar morphology over the 6 months of follow-up. Overall morphology improved in all the groups. Observers rated scar vascularization, pigmentation, thickness, relief, and pliability of the scar. All these parameters were significantly improved (p<0.005) in treated patients compared with the parameters of untreated patients. Observers noted scar hyperpigmentation were similar in the treated patients in Example I. It will be seen therefore that in the important areas of scar assessment, the patients treated in all examples showed statistically significant improvement in all parameters. Morphologic features together with stiffness, thickness, and irregularity in POSA and thickness and relief in OSA are probably the most important parameters for analysing scar hypertrophy. A number of patients had undergone previous surgery. The first scars (i.e. from the previous surgery) were compared with those produced by the new surgical procedure where the scar program was used. In two of these cases previous infra-mammary scars were excised in patients who had undergone reduction surgery elsewhere. The new infra-mammary scars demonstrated superior scar outcomes to those of the previous mid-line and periareolar scars. Morphologic assessment of scars at two months (not one month) were usually (although not always) reasonable predictors of long-term scar outcome. Predictors of poor outcome of long-term results appeared to be that of early signs of scar thickening or hypertrophy (Grade 3 morphologic scale). In the examples set forth above, support by microporous tape may not be needed, for example in cases where the wound is supported by subcuticular sutures. In one embodiment, tape is also not needed for smaller excisions or skin lesions, where tension on the skin is expected to be much less in these cases. In one embodiment, the invention results in a multimodal treatment that results in hydration, controlled inflammation, and collagen maturation in which the ingredients act synergistically to convert the microporous tape to an occlusive interactive. In several embodiments, the combination of ingredients (e.g., Bulbine, Centella and olive extracts, etc.) shows marked improvement over ingredients that only provide hydration. One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that embodiments of the present invention are well adapted to carry out the objects and obtain the ends and advantages mentioned, as well as those inherent therein. The present examples along with the methods, procedures, treatments, molecules, and specific ingredients described herein are presently representative of several embodiments, and are not intended as limitations on the scope of the invention. Changes therein and other uses which are encompassed within the spirit of the invention may be defined by the scope of the claims. 1. A method for treating damaged skin of a human in need thereof, said method consisting essentially of: topically applying at least one extract of Bulbine frutescens to the damaged skin of the human in need thereof, in an amount from about 9% to about 11% mass per mass of the composition;topically applying at least one extract of Centella asiatica to the damaged skin of the human in need thereof, in an amount from about 0.1% to about 2% mass per mass of the composition;topically applying oleuropein to the damaged skin of the human in need thereof, in an amount from about 0.18% to about 0.3% mass per mass of the composition;topically applying dimethicone to the damaged skin of the human in need thereof, in an amount from about 0.25% to about 3% mass per mass of the composition;wherein said extract of Bulbine frutescens, extract of Centella asiatica, oleuropein and dimethicone form a composition which is disposed onto a tape which is topically applied onto the damaged skin of the human in need thereof.
