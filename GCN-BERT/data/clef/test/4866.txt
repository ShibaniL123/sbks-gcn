Step 3: Preparation of trans-2-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)(4-(2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamido)-3-methylphenyl)amino)ethyl acetate (F1129). 2,4,6-Tripropyl-1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxatriphosphinane 2,4,6-trioxide (T3P®, 50% solution in ethyl acetate; 0.281 g, 0.441 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of trans-2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzoic acid (C12) (0.100 g, 220 mmol), 2-((4-amino-3-methylphenyl)(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl acetate (0.068 g, 0.220 mmol), and pyridine (0.053 g, 0.661 mmol) in anhydrous ethyl acetate (3 mL). The solution was stirred for 12 hours at 23° C. and concentrated. Purification by silica gel flash chromatography gave the title compound as a white foam (0.149 g, 86%).
