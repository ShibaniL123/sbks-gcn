Discussion The following description is not to be taken in a limiting sense but is made merely for the purpose of describing the general principles of the teachings of the embodiments discussed herein. To better understand the novelty of the teachings of the embodiments, reference is hereafter made to the accompanying drawings. It is to be fully recognized that the different teachings of the embodiments discussed below may be employed separately or in any suitable combination to produce desired results. As shown in the simplified illustration of FIG. 1, a first simplified system is provided. In this embodiment, the system suitably includes a first electromagnetic radiation source 100, a first waveguide 102 (or “radiant energy conduit”), a first fluid source 104 and a first treatment device 106. In another embodiment, the first electromagnetic radiation source 100 may be understood to include one or more waveguides 102. As shown, the treatment device 106 is in (1) radiant communication with the electromagnetic radiant source 100 via the waveguide 102 and in (2) fluid communication with the fluid source 104 via fluid conduit 107. The radiation source 100 is in radiant communication with the waveguide 102 via outlet 101 and the waveguide 102 is in radiant communication with the treatment device 106 via a proximal attachment 108. In this embodiment, the treatment device 106 is operationally configured to convey electromagnetic radiation and fluid received via waveguide 102 and fluid conduit 107 to a target site including but not necessarily limited to a subcutaneous target site of a subject 10, which in FIG. 1 includes a blood vessel 15. The system may also include an electromagnetic radiation source 100 operationally configured to communicate with two or more waveguides 102. As such, electromagnetic radiation may be conveyed via two or more waveguides 102 to target sites of one or more subjects. In the particular embodiment of FIG. 2, the electromagnetic radiation source 100 includes three outlets 101 in radiant communication with corresponding waveguides 102 and treatment devices 106 for conveying electromagnetic radiation to blood vessels of three separate target subjects 10. It is also contemplated that multiple outlets 101, waveguides 102 and treatment devices 106 may be used to convey electromagnetic radiation to multiple sites of a single target subject 10, e.g., locating one treatment device 106 within a blood vessel of a target subject's 10 arm and locating another treatment device 106 within a blood vessel of the target subject's 10 leg. When targeting fluid housed in a container or a surface location, multiple treatment devices 106 may target a similar container or site. Suitably, the treatment device 106 includes at least one port, inlet, or connection member operationally configured to receive or otherwise communicate with the waveguide 102 and at least one port, inlet, or connection member operationally configured to receive or otherwise communicate with the fluid conduit 107. It is contemplated that in one embodiment the treatment device 106 receive only electromagnetic radiation and no fluid, whereby the treatment device 106 is provided with only one or more connection members operationally configured to receive waveguides 102 in communication therewith. In still another embodiment, the treatment device 106 may be provided with one or more multi-purpose connection members operationally configured to receive or otherwise communicate with either a waveguide 102 or a fluid conduit 107. In one embodiment, the electromagnetic radiation source 100 may be operationally configured to produce electromagnetic radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. In another embodiment, the electromagnetic radiation source 100 may be operationally configured to produce electromagnetic radiation across a particular range of frequencies or wavelengths. In still another embodiment, the electromagnetic radiation source 100 may be operationally configured to produce electromagnetic radiation at a particular frequency or wavelength. In still another embodiment, the electromagnetic radiation source 100 may be operationally configured to produce electromagnetic radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum at one or more intensities and/or one or more frequencies for a particular duration or durations. Thus, in one embodiment the electromagnetic radiation source 100 may be programmable or otherwise controlled manually to emanate electromagnetic radiation there from as desired. Turning to FIGS. 3 and 4, a simplified embodiment of a treatment device 106 is provided including a first body 109 and a second body 110 in communication with the first body 109. As shown, the first body 109 has a longitudinal axis A-A and the second body 110 has a longitudinal axis B-B. Non-linear configurations of the bodies 109 and 110 are also herein contemplated for implementation. The outer surfaces of the first and second bodies 109, 110 are not necessarily limited to a particular surface ornamentation, but, it may be desirable to include an outer surface configuration for ease of use by one or more persons handling or using the treatment device 106. Thus, the outer surface of the treatment device 106 may be smooth and/or textured. The outer surface of the treatment device 106 may also include raised surface members or depressed surface areas, e.g., parallel ridges to frictionally engage a person's hand or fingers. As depicted in FIG. 4, the first body 109 includes (1) a first inlet 111 in communication with a first opening 114 therein and (2) a first outlet 113 in communication with a second opening 115 therein—the first opening 114 being in radiant communication with the second opening 115. The second body 110 includes a second inlet 112 in communication with a third opening 116 therein. The second body 110 is suitably connected to the first body 109 in a manner effective to communicate the third opening 116 with the second opening 115. Thus, the second opening 115 suitably lies in communication with both the first opening 114 and the third opening 116. More particularly, the first inlet 111 is operationally configured to receive a waveguide 102 in attachment thereto to provide radiant communication between the electromagnetic radiation source 100 and the first body 109. Likewise, the second inlet 112 is operationally configured to receive a fluid conduit 107 in attachment thereto to provide fluid communication between the fluid source 104 and the second body 110. Thus, the first outlet 113 suitably lies (1) in radiant communication with the first inlet 111 and (2) in fluid communication with the second inlet 112 in a manner effective to emit electromagnetic radiation and/or discharge fluid out through the first outlet 113. In one embodiment, the first and second inlets 111, 112 may be operationally configured to receive a corresponding waveguide 102 and fluid conduit 107 in releasable attachment thereto. In another embodiment, one or more of the inlets 111, 112 may be operationally configured to receive a corresponding waveguide 102 and fluid conduit 107 in permanent attachment thereto. As desired, the one or more of the inlets 111, 112 may be operationally configured to receive a corresponding waveguide 102 and fluid conduit 107 in sealed attachment thereto or in a manner effective to diminish leakage of radiant energy and/or fluid during operation of the treatment device 106 and system. In still another embodiment, the treatment device 106, waveguide 102 and fluid conduit 107 may be provided as a single assembly. Still referring to FIG. 4, the first opening 114 and the second opening 115 may be linearly aligned along the longitudinal axis A-A of the first body 109. In another embodiment, the first opening 114 and the second opening 115 may be linearly aligned substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis A-A of the first body 109. In still another embodiment, the first opening 114 and the opening 115 may be disposed within the first body 109 in a non-linear configuration effective to guide electromagnetic radiation from the first inlet 111 out through the outlet 113. Suitably, the first opening 114 and the second opening 115 have an inner surfaces operationally configured to guide electromagnetic radiation there through as desired. Thus, in one aspect, the treatment device 106 functions as a waveguide effective to guide electromagnetic radiation received at the first inlet 111 out through the first outlet 113 as desired. In one embodiment, the treatment device 106 may guide electromagnetic radiation there through unobstructed. In another embodiment, the treatment device 106 may be operationally configured to act on the electromagnetic radiation in one or more modes effective to transform the electromagnetic radiation prior to exiting out through the first outlet 113. As shown in FIG. 4, the first and second openings 114, 115 may be defined by cylindrical inner surfaces. In another embodiment, the first and second openings 114, 115 may be defined by curved non-cylindrical inner surfaces. In another embodiment, the first and second openings 114, 115 may be defined by multi-sided inner surfaces. It is also contemplated that the first and second openings 114, 115 be provided with non-corresponding inner surfaces, e.g., the first opening 114 having four sides and the second opening 115 having a cylindrical inner surface. In one embodiment, the first and second openings 114, 115 may include substantially similar inner diameters or widths. In another embodiment, first and second openings 114, 115 may include different inner diameters or widths. As shown in FIG. 4, the first opening 114 includes a larger diameter than the second opening 115. In other embodiments, the size and shape of the first inlet 111 may or may not correspond to the size and shape of the first opening 114 and the size and shape of the first outlet 113 may or may not correspond to the size and shape of the second opening 115. In still another embodiment, the size and shape of the first inlet and/or the first opening 114 may be determined according to the size and shape of a waveguide 102 or intermediary device to be attached to the first inlet 111. Likewise, the size and shape of the first outlet 113 may be determined according to a particular target site of a subject 10, a particular dosage of radiant energy to be applied to a subject 10 and/or the size and shape of a hollow puncture forming member to be attached to the first outlet 113. Still referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the treatment device 106 may be operationally configured in a manner whereby the third opening 116 lies in fluid communication with second opening 115 at a point along the length of the first body 109 whereby fluid entering the second opening 115 may flow a particular distance to the outlet 113 as desired. Suitably, the fluid may flow through the treatment device 106 under pressure or via gravity in a manner effective for the fluid to exit out through the first outlet 113 as desired. In one embodiment, fluid may flow out through the first outlet 113 in a constant flow. In another embodiment, the system and/or treatment device 106 alone may be provided in a manner effective to provide intermittent fluid flow out through the first outlet 113. It is also contemplated that a fluid in the form of a liquid or liquid composition having a known refractive index may be introduced into the treatment device 106 via second inlet 112. In such embodiment, the present system may be operationally configured to produce a particular radiant energy at the radiation source 100 and transform the radiant energy within the treatment device 106 via the liquid or liquid composition within the second opening 115 to produce a desired radiant energy emitted out through the first outlet 113. In other words, the waveguide characteristics of the treatment device 106 may be changed as desired according to the refractive index of the fluid introduced into the treatment device 106. Said another way, the numerical aperture of the treatment device 106 may be altered as desired or otherwise determined according to type of fluid introduced into the treatment device 106. In one simplified example where the fluid source is a saline solution administered to a target subject, a first commercially available saline solution product may have a higher salt content than a second commercially available saline solution product, changing the index of refraction of the fluid of the system. In such situation where the first saline solution product is replaced by the second saline solution product for a particular target subject, the output of electromagnetic radiation at the radiation source 100 may need to be adjusted to ensure a substantially similar emission of electromagnetic radiation out from the treatment device 106. Likewise, the radiation source 100 may need to be adjusted to ensure a substantially similar emission of electromagnetic radiation out from the treatment device 106 when the index of refraction of a known fluid is changed by the addition of one or more one or more therapeutic agents to the fluid being administered to a target subject. Thus, it is herein contemplated that one or more calculations may be made to determine a particular frequency and amplitude of radiant energy to be emitted from a treatment device 106 or treatment assembly 200, 300 (discussed below) based on the index of refraction of the fluid or fluid solution used in addition to other system characteristics or parameters. Such calculations may also take into account degradation qualities of the waveguide 102 and/or treatment device 106 being used. The treatment device 106 may also include one or more optical interfaces 120 located between the first inlet 111 and the second opening 115 for transforming electromagnetic radiation transmitted through the treatment device 106. In one example, one or more optical interfaces 120 may be located at the junction between the first opening 114 and the second opening 115. In still another embodiment, one or more optical interfaces 120 may be located at one or more points within the second opening 115. The one or more optical interfaces 120 are suitably operationally configured to transform the electromagnetic radiation received from the waveguide 102 into a particular type of electromagnetic beam 126 (see for example FIG. 5) to be emitted out from the treatment device 106 via the first outlet 113. In still another implementation, it is further contemplated that the system may be operationally configured to produce a particular radiant energy at the radiation source 100 and transform the radiant energy within the treatment device 106 via the liquid or liquid composition within the second opening 115 and one or more optical interfaces 120 to transform the electromagnetic radiation received from the waveguide 102 into a particular type of electromagnetic beam 126 to be emitted out through the first outlet 113. As understood by a skilled artisan, electromagnetic radiation 125 propagates through a waveguide, such as an optical fiber, according to the phenomenon of total internal reflection (see for example FIG. 5). By employing one or more optical interfaces 120 the present treatment device 106 is operationally configured to transform, e.g., decrease the spatial cross section of the electromagnetic radiation 126 as desired. It is also contemplated that the frequency and amplitude of the electromagnetic radiation 125 may be changed and/or controlled via non-linear conversions including, but not necessarily limited to the addition of quantum dots to fluid entering the treatment device 106. In one implementation, the one or more optical interfaces 120 of the present application may be described as optical lenses. Suitable optical lenses include, but are not necessarily limited to parallel radiant energy forming lenses, grin lenses, focusing lenses, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the treatment device 106 may include a parallel radiant energy forming lens 120 within the first body 109 or adjacent the first inlet 111 or first outlet 113. For example, the lens 120 may include a collimating lens operationally configured to transform electromagnetic radiation into parallel electromagnetic beams as shown in the simplified illustration of FIG. 5. In one embodiment, the numerical aperture of a collimating lens is about equal to the numerical aperture of the source, i.e., the waveguide coupled to the collimator. In another embodiment, the numerical aperture of a collimating lens is greater than the numerical aperture of the source. In another embodiment, the numerical aperture of a collimating lens is less than the numerical aperture of the source. In another embodiment, one or more optical interfaces 120 may be provided as grin lenses (as understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art of gradient-index optics) operationally configured to substantially match the propagation of electromagnetic radiation received from a waveguide 102 into the propagation defined by treatment device 106 and/or the hollow puncture forming member 150 (see FIG. 6) attached thereto. In another embodiment, one or more optical interfaces 120 may be provided as focusing lenses operationally configured to focus substantially all of the radiant energy exiting the waveguide 102 into a hollow puncture forming member 150 in radiant communication there with. Thus, in one embodiment the distance of the proximal end 152 of a hollow puncture forming member 150 from an optical interface 120 may be determined according to the focal length of the optical interface 120. In one non-limiting embodiment, the focusing lens may include, but is not necessarily limited to a plano-convex lens. Depending on (1) the desired radiant energy output conveyed to a target, and/or (2) the configuration of the waveguide 102 and/or the treatment device 106 and/or the hollow puncture forming member 150, one or more optical interfaces 120 including, but not necessarily limited to plano-convex lenses, biconvex lenses, positive meniscus lenses, negative meniscus lenses, plano concave lenses, biocancave lenses, and combinations thereof may be employed as desired. As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, optical interfaces 120 may extend across substantially the entire width or diameter of the opening where housed in a manner effective to prevent radiant energy from passing out around the perimeter of the optical interface 120. In one embodiment, an optical interface 120 may be located at the junction between a first opening 114 and the second opening 115 whereby the optical interface 120 extends across the whole inner surface of the first opening 114 ensuring that the radiant energy intended to exit out from the first outlet 113 first propagates through the optical interface 120. In another embodiment as shown in FIG. 7, including an optical interface 120 located at the junction between a first opening 114 and the second opening 115, the optical interface 120 may be located within the second opening 115 extending across substantially the entire inner diameter of the second opening 115 in a manner effective to prevent radiant energy from passing out around the perimeter of the optical interface 120. With reference again to FIG. 6, the first outlet 113 may be operationally configured to receive a hollow puncture forming member 150 in permanent or releasable attachment thereto. Suitably, the hollow puncture forming member 150 lies in both radiant communication and fluid communication with the second opening 115 in a manner effective to (1) receive and emit electromagnetic radiation and (2) receive and discharge fluid out through the open tip 151 of the hollow puncture forming member 150 (see for example FIG. 8). Thus, in one embodiment the hollow puncture forming member 150 suitably comprises an inner surface operationally configured to act as a waveguide, e.g., a liquid light guide, for guiding electromagnetic radiation out through the open tip 151. As such, the treatment device 106 may be defined as having at least two waveguides in radiant communication for delivery of electromagnetic radiation from a waveguide 102 to a target site of a subject 10 out beyond the open tip 151. Referring to FIGS. 6-7, the first outlet 113 and second opening 115 may provide a female type mating surface for receiving a hollow puncture forming member 150 therein. Although a hollow puncture forming member 150 may be mated to a functionally desirable depth within the second opening 115, the proximal end 152 of the hollow puncture forming member 150 suitably remains downstream of the junction 129 between second opening 115 and third opening 116 during operation. To ensure such configuration, the inner surface of the second opening 115 may include a raised surface as desired operationally configured to act as a stop for preventing travel distance of a hollow puncture forming member 150 beyond such stop. In another embodiment (not shown), the second opening 115 may be provided as a threaded connection for receiving a corresponding hollow puncture forming member 150 in threaded connection thereto. In still another embodiment, the hollow puncture forming member 150 may include a hub 155 operationally configured to attach to or slip onto the first body 109 whereby the opening of the hollow puncture forming member 150 is axially aligned with the longitudinal axis A-A of the first body 109 (see for example FIGS. 9 and 10). Without limiting the invention to a particular embodiment, one exemplary hollow puncture forming member 150 may include a cannula. In another embodiment, the hollow puncture forming member 150 may include an intravenous cannula. Cannula may have a blunt end, e.g., blunt-tip microcannula, beveled blunt end cannula, or deflected tip point as desired. Suitable cannula may be constructed from one or more materials, including non-static materials, including but not necessarily limited to metals, plastics, composite materials, crystalline materials, and combinations thereof. In one exemplary embodiment, a cannula may be constructed from stainless steel. In another exemplary embodiment, a cannula may be constructed from hyperchrome stainless steel tubing. Cannula may also include lancent points as desired. In another embodiment, the hollow puncture forming member 150 may include a hollow needle type device. Suitable needles may include, but are not necessarily limited to reusable or disposable hypodermic needles, emulsifying needles, lancet point needles, non-coring needles, and pipetting needles constructed from one or more materials, for example non-static materials, including but not necessarily limited to metals, plastics, composite materials, crystalline materials, and combinations thereof. Suitable hypodermic needle materials of construction include, but are not necessarily limited to aluminum, tantalum, stainless steel, niobium, nickel iron alloys, nickel alloys, molybdenum, silicon, polymeric materials, composite materials, and combinations thereof. In another embodiment, hypodermic needles may be constructed from polytetrafluoroethylene (“PTFE”). Hypodermic needles may also include one or more tipping technologies to effect hypodermic injections or to otherwise enhance penetration of a surface of a target site. Suitable tipping technologies include, but are not necessarily limited to tips coated with PTFE. Because the treatment device 106 may be built to scale, the needle to be employed is not necessarily limited to any particular gauge or range of gauges. In still another embodiment, the hollow puncture forming member 150 may include a catheter or flexible catheter tube operationally configured to be inserted into a target body cavity, duct, or vessel. Suitable catheters may include, but are not necessarily limited to angioplasty catheters, internal drug delivery catheters, laser ablation catheters, ultrasonic ablation catheters, thermal or mechanical disruptive catheters, stent delivery catheters, catheters for monitoring drug or other chemical concentrations/indications in vivo, and catheters for monitoring body functions (e.g., cardiac output). One exemplary catheter may include a tapered PTFE catheter. In still another embodiment, the hollow puncture forming member 150 may include a liquid light guide. In one embodiment, the treatment device 106 may be operationally configured to receive a light guide adapter in releasable attachment thereto for communicating the treatment device 106 with the liquid light guide. In another embodiment, the distal end of the treatment device 106 or first outlet 113 may be operationally configured to receive a liquid light guide in direct attachment thereto. In one aspect, the hollow puncture forming member 150 may provide for atraumatic insertion for providing radiant energy and one or more therapeutic agents as described above. Depending on the intended use, a particular hollow puncture forming member 150 may also be provided as a medical grade device, e.g., sterile, disposable, reusable. As stated, the treatment device 106 and hollow puncture forming member 150 may be built to scale for a particular operation. Said another way, treatment using the present device, assembly, system and method is scalable whereby larger inner width or inner diameter hollow puncture forming members 150 may be operationally configured to convey more radiant energy there through than smaller hollow puncture forming members 150. Although the treatment device 106 and hollow puncture forming member 150 may be built to scale, for the purposes of subcutaneous applications in animals, suitable hollow puncture forming members 150 may include hypodermic needles according to, but not necessarily limited to the size characteristics of Table 1 below.

In still another embodiment, a hollow puncture forming member 150 or first body 109 may include an open tip 151 or first outlet 113 in addition to the elements of FIGS. 12 and 13. Turning to FIGS. 14A-14C, another simplified embodiment of a treatment device 106 is provided. Like the embodiment described above, the treatment device 106 of this embodiment suitably includes a hollow first body 109 having a longitudinal axis C-C and a second body 110 in communication with the first body 109 and having a longitudinal axis D-D, the first body 109 being operationally configured to receive a waveguide 102 at a first end and a hollow puncture forming member 150 at a second end, the second body 110 being operationally configured to receive a fluid conduit 107 in attachment thereto. Other non-linear configurations of the bodies 109 and 110 are also contemplated for implementation with this particular embodiment of the treatment device 106. In one implementation, the second body 110 may be flexible or bendable. With attention to FIGS. 14A-B, the treatment device 106 may further include a conduit 134 in fluid communication with the second body 110 at a first end and operationally configured to receive a fluid conduit 107 in fluid communication thereto.

In another embodiment, the conduit 134 may be provided as a non-linear member as shown. A conduit 134 may be constructed from one or more rigid materials and/or one or more flexible materials as desired. For example, the conduit 134 may be constructed from one or more metals, polymeric materials, rubbers, glass, plexiglass, filled composite materials, and combinations thereof Likewise, the conduit 134 may include a length as desired for a particular use. Where the treatment device 106 is to be used to convey radiant energy to a subcutaneous site of an animal, the conduit 134 suitably includes a shape and/or a length providing for adequate manipulation and/or placement of the treatment device 106 and fluid conduit 107 for ease of operation. For use with persons, the conduit 134 may be provided as a flexible tube constructed from one or more polymeric materials and have a length from about 1.27 cm to about 30.48 (about 0.5 inches to about 12.0 inches). With reference to FIG. 14A, one suitable conduit 134 for use with a person 10 has a length of about 11.43 cm (about 4.5 inches). In one suitable embodiment, the conduit 134 engages the second body via a sealable connection to minimize fluid loss out from the point of attachment between the conduit 134 and the second body 110. In another suitable embodiment, an interconnector may be used to join the conduit 134 to the second body 110 as a snap fit or threaded type male/female fitting. In another suitable embodiment, the distal end of the conduit 134 may include a mating surface or other connector operationally configured to mate or otherwise engage the second inlet 112 or second body 110. In addition, the first inlet 111 is operationally configured to receive a waveguide 102 in radiant communication there with in a manner effective to prevent or otherwise minimize leakage, emission or escape of electromagnetic radiation from within the first body 109, e.g., at a junction between the first body 109 and the waveguide 102. The treatment device 106 of FIGS. 14A-14C suitably includes one or more optical interfaces 120 housed within a compartment 135 near the first inlet 111 in a manner effective to transform radiant energy received therein to produce a treatment dose of radiant energy emitted out through the tip 151 of the hollow puncture forming member 150.

As shown in the exploded view of FIG. 14C, the treatment device 106 may be provided as an assembly including a first body 109 permanently or releasably attachable to a corresponding conduit 134, a hollow intermediary winged member 136 permanently or releasably attachable to the first body 109 to allow for easy fixation of the treatment device 106 to a target subject 10 to help prevent pistoning and/or rolling of the treatment device 106 during operation, the winged member 136 being axially aligned with the longitudinal axis C-C, and a hollow puncture forming member 150 permanently or releasably attachable to the winged member 136, the hollow puncture forming member 150 being axially aligned with the longitudinal axis C-C. The hollow intermediary winged member 136 may be substantially planar or include a surface ornamentation effective to abut an outer surface as desired. For example, the hollow intermediary winged member 136 may include a curved surface operationally configured to abut the curvature of the surface of a person's 10 arm. Likewise, the hollow intermediary winged member 136 (or other portion of the treatment device 106) may include an adhesive type surface for adhering the treatment device to a target surface. In addition to single use disposal of one or more of the above parts of the treatment device 106, each of the first body 109, the conduit 134, the hollow intermediary winged member 136, and the hollow puncture forming member 150 may be operationally configured for reuse in any combination. With reference now to FIGS. 15A-15C, another simplified embodiment of a treatment device 106 is provided. The treatment device 106 of this embodiment includes a first body 109 having a first inlet 111 and first outlet 113 and a second body 110 having a second inlet 112, the second body 110 being in fluid communication with the first body 109. With attention to FIG. 15B, first body 109 may be described as having a multi-sectional or multi-compartment configuration (see Sections 1, 2 and 3). Even though the outer surface configuration of the first body 109 may vary, in the embodiment of FIGS. 15A-15C the first body 109 includes a cylindrical shape of one or more outer diameters. In particular, Section 1 has the smallest outer diameter and Section 3 has the greatest outer diameter. The particular configuration of FIGS. 15A-15C is operationally configured for use with disposable hollow puncture forming members 150. Suitably, the configuration of the treatment device 106 assists in minimizing material costs and/or production costs while also being effective for different types of treatment operations. With attention to FIG. 15C, Section 1 of the first body 109 is operationally configured to receive a waveguide 102 in radiant communication thereto. Suitably, Section 1 includes an opening 160 defined by an inner surface 161 operationally configured to mate with a fiber optic connector 140. As shown in the simplified embodiment of FIG. 15C, the inner surface 161 of the opening 160 includes a stepped configuration effective to receive a slotted bayonet type fiber optic connector 140 such as a ST Connector in releasable attachment thereto. Section 2 of the first body 109 suitably includes an opening 162 defined by an inner surface 163 and one or more optical interfaces 120 disposed across the opening 162 as desired. In another embodiment it is contemplated that no optical interfaces 120 are employed. As shown, the opening 162 is in radiant communication with the opening 160 of Section 1 and in fluid communication with the second body 110, the opening 162 having a first volume for receiving radiant energy and/or fluid therein including one or more fluids in an amount up to the volume of the opening 162 as received via the third opening 116. At a minimum, the opening 162 of Section 2 includes an inner surface configuration and/or volume operationally configured to direct radiant energy and a desired amount of fluid out from the opening 162 into the opening 164 of Section 3, which is in radiant and fluid communication with opening 162. Section 3 may also include an inner surface 165 configuration effective to assist in directing radiant energy and/or fluid from the opening 162 out through the first outlet 113. In this particular embodiment, the opening 164 includes a funnel type configuration 166 at the junction with the opening 162 operationally configured to optimize the amount of radiant energy entering the opening 164. Likewise, the first outlet 113 of the opening 164 is operationally configured to receive a hollow puncture forming member 150 in attachment thereto. Thus, in one exemplary mode of operation, radiant energy and/or fluid suitably exits the treatment device 106 via the first outlet 113 or a hollow puncture forming member 150 attached thereto. Suitably, the fluid and radiant energy are conveyed in a manner effective for the hollow puncture forming member 150 attached thereto to act optically similar to a liquid light guide as understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art. As shown in FIG. 15C, the opening 164 may include a cylindrical shape, but the inner surface 165 of the opening 164 may include a different surface configuration (1) for receiving a particular shaped hollow puncture forming member 150 therein and/or (2) for acting on the radiant energy and/or fluid conveyed there through as desired. Section 3 may also include a threaded surface 167 as desired for receiving a hollow member, e.g., a hollow puncture forming member 150 in releasable attachment thereto. In addition, the second body 110 may be disposed about 45.0 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis of the treatment device 106 as shown or, in another embodiment, the second body 110 may be disposed substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the treatment device 106. Referring now to FIG. 16, Section 2 of this embodiment suitably includes one or more optical interfaces 120 disposed across the inner surface 163 of the opening 162 in a manner effective to transform the electromagnetic radiation received from the waveguide 102 into one or more particular types of electromagnetic beams to be emitted out through first outlet 113. As shown, the inner surface 161 suitably receives the fiber optic connector 140 in releasable attachment whereby the distal end of the ferrule 141 of the connector extends to a point functionally near or in abutment with an optical interface 120. In operation, fluid and radiant energy are combined in the opening 162 in a manner effective for the hollow puncture forming member 150 to operate as a waveguide, e.g., a liquid light guide. In this embodiment, the one or more optical interfaces 120 are operationally configured to transform the electromagnetic radiation 125 received from a waveguide 102 in a manner effective to emit beam(s) 126 out through the first outlet 113 and/or hollow puncture forming member 150 attached thereto as desired. As shown in FIG. 17, an optical interface 120 may be provided as a collimator type lens operationally configured to transform electromagnetic radiation into substantially parallel beams 126 as shown. In another embodiment, an optical interface 120 may be provided as a converging or focusing type lens operationally configured to transform electromagnetic radiation as shown in FIG. 18. In still another embodiment, an optical interface 120 may be provided as a diverging type lens (see FIG. 19) where the treatment device 106 includes an opening 164 larger than the opening 162 housing the optical interface 120. Turning now to FIGS. 20 and 21, two other embodiments of the treatment device 106 are provided. As FIG. 20 illustrates, the second body 110 may extend from the first body 109 according to angle A-1. As shown in FIG. 21, the second body 110 may extend from the first body 109 in a substantially perpendicular orientation relative to the longitudinal axis A-A of the treatment device 106 suitable for supplying one or more fluids to the first body 109. Surface configurations of the first and second bodies 109, 110 may vary according to one or more particular applications as desired. The embodiments of FIGS. 20 and 21 are particular assemblies operationally configured to seal or otherwise separate the waveguide 102 from the hollow puncture forming member 150 attached thereto. As shown in FIGS. 22 and 23, the treatment device 106 may be provided as an assembly 200 of one or more reusable component parts and/or one or more disposable component parts. Although the various component parts may be assembled as desired, in one mode of operation it is contemplated to manufacture the treatment device (or as may be referred to here as a “treatment assembly” 200) in a manner effective to minimize manufacturing costs and/or maximize sales of various replacement component parts as desired. In one simplified embodiment, the treatment assembly 200 may include (1) a waveguide member 210, (2) a main body 220 and (3) a hollow member assembly or a hollow puncture forming member assembly 230. In one implementation, the waveguide member 210, main body 220 and hollow puncture forming member assembly 230 may be provided assembled and following use the entire assembly 200 may be disposed of or reused. In another implementation, one or more component parts may be replaced prior to reuse of the assembly 200 as desired. In still another implementation, the waveguide member 210, main body 220 and hollow puncture forming member assembly 230 may be provided unassembled whereby particular sized and/or shaped component parts may be fitted together for a particular purpose. For example, a hollow puncture forming member 150 of a particular length and/or gauge may be required as compared to other implementations of the assembly 200. In another embodiment, a particular volume of fluid or fluid solution may be required, which may require a main body 220 having a particular size and shape. In still another embodiment, a waveguide member 210 of a particular length (or a series of waveguides joined together) and/or inner diameter or width may be necessary for a particular treatment or use. In one embodiment, the main body 220 includes (1) a waveguide receiving inlet 111 operationally configured to receive a waveguide member 210 in a manner effective to provide radiant communication between the main body 220 and the waveguide member 210 and (2) an outlet 113 operationally configured to receive the hollow puncture forming member assembly 230 in a manner effective to provide radiant and fluid communication between the main body 220 and the hollow puncture forming member assembly 230. As shown in FIGS. 22 and 23, the main body 220 may include a female type waveguide receiving inlet 111 defined by an inner surface 221, a fluid inlet 223, and a cavity 222 in radiant communication with the waveguide receiving inlet and in fluid communication with the fluid inlet 223. As shown, the main body 220 may further include one or more optical interfaces 120 defining the border between the waveguide receiving inlet and the cavity 222. In one particularly advantageous embodiment, the optical interface 120 may be disposed along the cavity 222 in a manner effective to fluidly seal the cavity 222 from the waveguide receiving inlet 111. Where the assembly 200 is used on an animal, the waveguide member 210 is suitably isolated from exposure to one or more bodily fluids of an animal to be targeted with the assembly 200. In one embodiment, the optical interface 120 may include a lens according to the description of lenses above. In another embodiment, the optical interface 120 may include a window type member constructed from one or more transparent materials, one or more partially transparent materials, one or more translucent materials, one or more partially translucent materials, and combinations thereof for attenuation of electromagnetic radiation as desired. Suitably, the cavity 222 is operationally configured to receive a portion of the hollow puncture forming member 150 therein up to a point of abutment of the proximal end 152 with the optical interface 120 that forms a barrier of the cavity 222. As shown, the proximal end 152 of the hollow puncture forming member 150 may lie near the optical interface 120 in a manner effective to maximize a desired amount of radiant energy and/or fluid entering the hollow puncture forming member 150. In one embodiment, the hollow puncture forming member assembly 230 may engage the distal end of the main body 220 in a manner effective to prevent or other minimize movement of the hollow puncture forming member assembly 230 during assembly 200 operation. In another embodiment, attachment of the hollow puncture forming member assembly 230 to the main body 220 may be accomplished solely by mating the hollow puncture forming member 150 with the first outlet 113 in a manner effective to prevent or other minimize movement of the hollow puncture forming member 150 during assembly 200 operation. In another embodiment, the main body 220 and hollow puncture forming member assembly 230 may be provided as a single unit or one piece item for reuse or for one time use. In such embodiment, the orientation of the hollow puncture forming member 150 within the cavity 222 may be preset or the hollow puncture forming member assembly 230 may include a slidable or otherwise adjustable hollow puncture forming member 150 for determining the distance between the optical interface 120 and the proximal end 152 of the hollow puncture forming member 150. It is further contemplated that a slidable or otherwise adjustable hollow member or hollow puncture forming member 150 may be replaced and disposed of as desired while reusing the remaining assembly 200 component parts. Still referring to FIGS. 22 and 23 a suitable waveguide member 210 includes a nose 211 operationally configured to mate with the female type waveguide receiving inlet 111 of the main body 220. In one embodiment, the nose 211 may be operationally configured to engage the inner surface 221 in fixed abutment thereto during operation of the assembly 200. In other embodiments, the nose 211 may engage the inner surface 221 via one or more methods including, but not necessarily limited to a snap-fit connection, a threaded connection, a push and turn connection, a screw on configuration, and a press fit connection. In another embodiment, screws, bolts, rivets and the like may be used to attach the nose 211 to the main body 220. Thus, it is further contemplated that one or more seals or gasket type members may be used between the nose 211 and the main body 220 as desired. As shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 22 and 23, the nose 211 is mated with the female type waveguide receiving inlet 111 of the main body 220 via a slotted connection. Without limiting the invention to a particular embodiment, the orientation of the nose 211 within the waveguide receiving inlet may be determined according to one or more assembly 200 design characteristics, fluid characteristics, attenuation characteristics of the optical interface 120, the angular distribution of light exiting the waveguide member 210, the desired emission of radiant energy out from the assembly 200, and combinations thereof. As shown, the outer surface of the nose 211 may lie in substantial abutment with the inner surface 221 whereby the outlet of the core 213 of the waveguide member 210 lies near the optical interface 120 minimizing the distance of propagation of electromagnetic radiation between the waveguide member 210 and the optical interface 120. As shown, the nose 211 suitably engages the main body 220 in a manner effective to minimize loss of radiant energy out through the female type waveguide receiving inlet 111 of the main body 220. In another embodiment, the nose 211 may engage the main body 220 in a manner effective to direct radiant energy toward the optical interface 120 at a distance up to about the outer edge of the inlet waveguide receiving 111. As shown in FIGS. 22 and 23, one suitable waveguide member 210 may include an outer skirt 212 for ease of manual operation. The inner surface 215 of the skirt 212 may be operationally configured to engage the outer surface 224 of the main body 220 in a fixed position during operation of the assembly 200. Thus, in one embodiment the wave guide member 210 may be attached to the main body 220 via the skirt 212 rather than via engagement of the nose 211 and female type waveguide receiving inlet of the main body 220 as discussed above. Without limiting the mode of engagement, the skirt 212 and outer surface 224 of the main body 220 may be attached via cooperating threads, a lug-slot connection, a push and turn connection, a snap-fit connection, via screws, bolts, rivets and the like, or otherwise latching the skirt 212 to the main body 220 as desired. As shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 22 and 23, a suitable skirt 212 may include a shoulder 214 operationally configured to abut the perimeter of the inlet 111 providing a desired depth of the nose 211 within the female type waveguide receiving inlet 111 of the main body 220. Still referring to FIGS. 22 and 23, in one suitable embodiment at least part of the central axis of the waveguide member 210 is substantially aligned with the central axis of the hollow puncture forming member 150. In operation, radiant energy is emitted from the core 213 of the waveguide member 210 through the optical interface 120 into the proximal end 152 of the hollow puncture forming member 150, whereby the hollow puncture forming member 150 acts in a manner similar to a liquid light guide. Turning now to FIG. 24, another treatment assembly 300 is provided. Without limiting the assembly 300 to any particular number of assembled component parts one suitable assembly 300 may include (1) a waveguide member 310, (2) a main body 320 and (3) a hollow member assembly or hollow puncture forming member assembly 330. In one implementation, the waveguide member 310, main body 320 and hollow puncture forming member assembly 330 may be provided assembled and following use the entire assembly 300 may be disposed of or reused. In another implementation, one or more component parts of the assembly 300 may be replaced prior to reuse of the assembly 300. In still another implementation, the waveguide member 310, main body 320 and hollow puncture forming member assembly 330 may be provided unassembled whereby particular sized and/or shaped component parts may be fitted together for a particular treatment or use. For example, hollow members or hollow puncture forming member 150 of a particular length and/or gauge may be required for a particular use as compared to other implementations of the assembly 300. In another embodiment, a particular volume of fluid or fluid solution may be required, which may require a main body 320 having a particular size and shape cavity 322 for receiving fluid therein. In still another embodiment, a waveguide member 310 of a particular length (or a series of waveguides joined together) and/or inner diameter or width may be necessary for a particular treatment or use. As shown, the waveguide member 310 may include one or more waveguides 102 in series and one or more optical interfaces 120 mounted at the distal end of the waveguide 102. In one embodiment, one or more optical interfaces 120 may be permanently connected to the waveguide 102. In another embodiment, one or more optical interfaces 120 may be releasably attached to the waveguide 102 providing for interchangeability of optical interfaces 120 and varying the possible optical characteristics of the waveguide member 310 and/or assembly 300. In one embodiment, an optical interface 120 may be connected to a waveguide 102 via one or more intermediary members operationally configured to convey electromagnetic radiation from the waveguide 102 toward the optical interface 120. Without limiting the invention, suitable intermediary members may include spacer type members with apertures there through, e.g., a ring type spacer connected on one side by the waveguide 102 and connected to the optical interface 120 on its opposing side. As seen in the simplified embodiment of FIGS. 24 and 25, the waveguide member 310 includes an optical mount 313 operationally configured to surround or otherwise enclose at least part of the waveguide 102 and at least part of the optical interface 120 in a manner effective to maintain the optical interface 120 in a fixed position relative to the waveguide 102. In addition, the optical mount 313 may act as the nose of the waveguide member 310 for purposes of engaging the main body 320, thus, the outer surface of the optical mount 313 may include a surface configuration for attachment to the main body 320 as desired. For example, the optical mount 313 may engage the main body 320 in a manner similar as the nose 211 discussed above in relation to FIGS. 22 and 23. Likewise, the waveguide member 310 may include a skirt 312 and shoulder 314 similar as discussed above. In one embodiment, the main body 320 may include (1) an inlet 111 operationally configured to receive a waveguide member 310 in a manner effective for radiant communication between the main body 320 and the waveguide member 310 and (2) an outlet 113 operationally configured to receive the hollow puncture forming member assembly 330 in a manner effective for radiant and fluid communication between the main body 320 and the hollow puncture forming member assembly 330. As shown, the main body 320 may include a female type waveguide receiving inlet 111 defined by an inner surface 321, a fluid inlet 323 and a cavity 322 in radiant communication with the female type waveguide receiving inlet 111 and in fluid communication with the fluid inlet 323. In addition, the main body 320 may include a secondary optical interface 350 defining the border between the waveguide receiving inlet 111 and the cavity 322. In one particularly advantageous embodiment, the secondary optical interface 350 may be disposed along the cavity 322 in a manner effective to fluidly seal the cavity 322 from the waveguide receiving inlet 111 and, thus, physically seal the cavity 322 from the waveguide member 310 of the assembly 300—providing separation between the waveguide member 310 and the hollow puncture forming member 150. In one embodiment, the secondary optical interface 350 may include a lens according to the description of lenses above. In another embodiment, the secondary optical interface 350 may include a substantially planar window type member constructed from one or more transparent materials, one or more partially transparent materials, one or more translucent materials, one or more partially translucent materials, and combinations thereof, for attenuation of electromagnetic radiation as desired. In one suitable embodiment, the secondary optical interface 350 may include a transparent plastic material. In another suitable embodiment, the secondary optical interface 350 may include a transparent glass material. In another suitable embodiment, the secondary optical interface 350 may include a transparent crystalline material. Without limiting the invention, a suitable a secondary optical interface 350 may include a material (1) substantially impermeable to fluids or fluid solutions entering the cavity 322 during assembly 300 operation and (2) operationally configured to affect or not affect the propagation of radiant energy guided through the assembly 300 as desired. Where the assembly 300 is used on an animal, the waveguide member 310 is suitably isolated from exposure to one or more bodily fluids of the animal to be targeted with the assembly 300. Still referring to FIG. 24, the cavity 322 is operationally configured to receive a portion of the hollow puncture forming member 150 therein up to a point of abutment of the proximal end 152 of the hollow puncture forming member 150 with the secondary optical interface 350. As shown, the proximal end 152 of the hollow puncture forming member 150 may lie near the secondary optical interface 350 in a manner effective to maximize a desired amount of radiant energy and/or fluid entering the hollow puncture forming member 150. In one embodiment, the hollow puncture forming member assembly 330 may engage the distal end of the main body 320. For example, the outer surface of the main body 320 may be operationally configured to receive the hollow puncture forming member assembly 330 in releasable attachment thereto. In another embodiment, attachment of the hollow puncture forming member assembly 330 to the main body 320 may be accomplished solely by mating the hollow puncture forming member 150 with the first outlet 113 in a manner effective to prevent or other minimize movement of the hollow puncture forming member 150 during assembly 300 operation. In still another embodiment, the main body 320 and hollow puncture forming member assembly 330 may be provided as a single unit or one piece item for reuse or for one time use. In such embodiment, the orientation of the hollow puncture forming member 150 within the cavity 322 may be preset or the hollow puncture forming member assembly 330 may include a slidable or otherwise adjustable hollow puncture forming member 150 for determining the distance between the secondary optical interface 350 and the proximal end 152 of the hollow puncture forming member 150. It is further contemplated that a slidable or otherwise adjustable hollow puncture forming member 150 may be replaced and disposed of as desired while reusing the remaining assembly 300 component parts. Turning to FIG. 26, in operation electromagnetic radiation 125 may be conveyed through the core 213 of the waveguide member 310 and an optical interface 120, which is operationally configured to transform the electromagnetic energy 125 in a manner effective to convey transformed electromagnetic radiation 126 into the proximal end 152 of the hollow puncture forming member 150, whereby the hollow puncture forming member 150 is operationally configured to receive electromagnetic radiation 126 and fluid or a fluid solution received from fluid inlet 323 (according to exemplary Arrow F) in a manner effective for the hollow puncture forming member 150 to act in a similar manner as a liquid light guide for delivering radiant energy to one or more target sites, including a therapeutic amount of radiant energy and/or fluid or a fluid solution. As shown in FIG. 26, at least part of the central axis of the waveguide member 310 is substantially aligned with the central axis of the hollow puncture forming member 150. Turning to FIGS. 27-32, another treatment assembly 400 is provided. As shown in the simplified exploded view FIG. 27, the treatment assembly 400 suitably includes three main components, namely (1) a cable member 401, (2) an interconnect member 402 and (3) a hollow dispensing member 403. The cable member 401 is in radiant communication with electromagnetic radiation source 100 and the interconnect member 402. The interconnect member 402 is further in radiant communication with the hollow dispensing member 403 and in fluid communication with a fluid source 104. The hollow dispensing member 403 is operationally configured to provide an exit point of electromagnetic radiation and/or one or more fluids or fluid solutions out from the treatment assembly 400. With attention to FIG. 28, the cable member 401 is operationally configured to receive a waveguide 102 in radiant communication therewith. In this particular embodiment, the cable member 401 includes an overmold member 404 with a first opening or port 405 operationally configured to mate with a terminal end of a waveguide 102, e.g., a termination ferrule 407, and a second opening or port 406 operationally configured to mate with the interconnect member 402. Without limiting the invention, a suitable cable member 401 may further include the following component parts: (1) an electrical connector 409, (2) a printed circuit board (“PCB”) 410, (3) one or more light emitting diodes (“LED”) 411 and (4) a window member 412. An exploded view of an embodiment of the cable member 401 and waveguide 102 is depicted in FIG. 29. Suitably, the inner surface of the opening 405 corresponds in size and shape to at least part of the termination ferrule 407 (and interference member 408 attached thereto)—providing a close fit between the termination ferrule 407 and the overmold member 404. In suitable operation, the waveguide 102 is held in place via the termination ferrule 407 and the termination ferrule 407 and one or more optical interfaces 120 are held in place via the overmold member 404. In one embodiment, optical interfaces 120 may be machine fit, pressed within the cable member 401 after molding or overmolded into the overmold member 404. In another embodiment, the configuration of the opening 405 and optical interfaces 120 may allow an optical interface 120 to be held in a static position during assembly 400 operation. As shown, the optical interface 120 is disposed across the entire opening 405 eliminating electromagnetic radiation from propagating around the optical interface 120. As further shown in FIG. 28, a suitable interconnect member 402 includes (1) a main body 420, (2) an opening 421, (3) a window member 422 suitably transparent at corresponding electromagnetic frequencies, (4) an integrated circuit (“IC”) 424, (5) a fluid opening 426, (6) a cavity 427 in fluid communication with the fluid opening 426, (7) a nose 429, e.g., a tapered nose, having an outlet 428 in fluid communication with the cavity 427 and in radiant communication with the cable member 401 and (8) a connection member 430 attachable to the main body 420. In operation, the main body 420 is mated to the cable member 401 via opening 406. For example, the main body 420 may be mated to the cable member 401 via a snap fit connection including, but not necessarily limited to a detent type snap action built into the main body 420 and cable member 401. The interconnect member 402 is further depicted in the simplified illustrations of FIGS. 30A-30D. Again referring to FIG. 28, a hollow dispensing member 403 suitably includes a hub 440 having an inlet 441 and a hollow member 150 attached thereto having an outlet at its open tip 151—the hollow member 150 being in communication with the hub 440. As discussed above, the type of hollow member 150 that may be employed is not limited to any one particular embodiment. As depicted in FIG. 28, a suitable hollow dispensing member 403 is releasably attachable to the connection member 430. In one simplified embodiment, the connection member 430 may include a Luer lock type device and the hollow dispensing member 403 may include a Luer lock needle operationally compatible with the Luer lock 430 as understood by the skilled artisan. With reference to FIGS. 30D and 31, the hub 440 of a Luer lock needle is operationally configured to fit onto the outer surface of the nose 429 along the inner perimeter of the Luer lock 430. An exemplary blunt Luer lock needle is shown in FIG. 27. An exemplary sharp Luer lock needle is shown in FIG. 28. As also understood by the skilled artisan, Luer lock needles and other dispensing hollow members are typically disposable items—the hollow member 150 often being constructed from stainless steel and the hub 440 often being constructed from plastic including, but not necessarily limited to polypropylene. As discussed above, other hollow members 150 may be used, e.g., a catheter or flexible catheter tube. An example of a suitable Luer lock 430 is commercially available on the internet at www.qosina.com. Turning to FIG. 32, the longitudinal axis of the waveguide 102, cavity 427 and hollow member 150 of the treatment assembly 400 are axially aligned. In addition, the center of the optical interface 120 is substantially aligned with the longitudinal axis of each. In operation, the termination ferrule 407 is connected to the cable member 401 in a manner whereby the distal end of the waveguide 102 is set a predetermined distance (also may be referred to as a precise distance, because distance may affect the focus, e.g., the collimation, of electromagnetic radiation into fluid in the interconnect member 402) from the optical interface 120 thereby minimizing the distance of propagation of electromagnetic radiation between the waveguide 102 and the optical interface 120. Although the treatment assembly 400 may built to scale, in one suitable embodiment the distal end of the waveguide 102 may lie from a position of abutment with the optical interface 120 up to a precise distance apart from the optical interface 120 during assembly 400 operation. As described above, the main body 420 suitably mates with the cable member 401 in a manner effective to minimize the distance of propagation of electromagnetic radiation between the optical interface 120 and the opening 421 of the interconnect member 402 in a manner effective to maximize energy transfer from the waveguide 102 through the hollow dispensing member 403. As shown in FIGS. 31 and 32, the distal end of the overmold member 404 suitably abuts a rim 425 disposed along the main body 420 when the component parts are assembled for operation. In one suitable embodiment, the opening 421 of the interconnect member 402 may lie from a position of abutment with the optical interface 120 up to a predetermined apart from the optical interface 120 during assembly 400 operation. This distance suitably has no effect on assembly 400 operation. It is further contemplated that the inner surface of the opening 421 may be coated with one or more anti-reflective optical coatings in a manner effective to negate reflection losses of electromagnetic radiation. As light propagates from an electromagnetic radiation source 100 (see for example FIG. 1) through a waveguide 102, the numerical aperture of the waveguide 102 defines the exit angle of electromagnetic radiation from the waveguide 102 as the electromagnetic radiation interfaces the optical interface, e.g., lens, 120. As electromagnetic radiation 126 enters the opening 421, the electromagnetic radiation 126 propagates through the window member 422 continuing through the cavity 427 and hollow member 150 exiting out there from toward a target site. A suitable window member 422 may be constructed from one or more materials including, but not necessarily limited to glass, synthetic quartz, polymeric material, e.g., sapphire, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the window member 422 may be machine fit, pressed in after molding within the interconnect member 402 or overmolded into the interconnect member 402 as desired. In another embodiment, the configuration of the inner surface of the opening 421 and the window member 422 may allow a window member 422 to be held in a static position during assembly 400 operation. As shown, a suitable window member 422 is disposed across the entire opening 421 sealing off the cavity 427 in a manner whereby electromagnetic radiation cannot propagate around the window member 422 and fluid cannot flow beyond the window member 422 toward the optical interface 120. In particular, the interconnect member 402, via window member 422, is operationally configured to isolate the waveguide 102, optical interface 120 and the air space adjacent the optical interface 120 from fluid or fluid solutions delivered to the optical interface 120 via fluid opening 426 (see Arrow F). In addition, the interconnect member 402, via window member 422, is operationally configured to isolate the waveguide 102 from the hollow dispensing member 403. When assembled, the IC 424, e.g., an encryption IC, or authentication IC as the terms are known by persons of ordinary skill in the art, is suitably attached to the surface of the main body 420 or to a depression along the main body 420 via one or more adhesive materials such as epoxy or the like. In operation, when the main body 420 is mated with the second opening 406 of the cable member 401, the IC 424 interfaces the electrical connector 409 of the cable member 401, which is held intact via the PCB 410. Suitably, the IC 424 electronically communicates assembly 400 operating information to the electrical connector 409 and PCB 410, which in turn may electrically communicate operating information to one or more LED 411 attached to the PCB 410 and/or to the electromagnetic radiation source 100. In a simplified mode of operation, the assembly 400 may be protected against counterfeiting of component parts whereby, to initiate use of the assembly 400, the IC 424 must electronically communicate with the electromagnetic radiation source 100 to validate authenticity of the interconnect member 402 before the electromagnetic radiation source 100 may be operated. As understood by the skilled artisan, one or more of the assembly 400 component parts and/or the electromagnetic radiation source 100 may be programmed as desired. Suitably, PCB 410 communicates with the electromagnetic radiation source 100 via wiring. Without limiting the invention, small gauge wiring from about 0.00501 mm2 to about 0.0320 mm2 (from about 40 AWG to about 32 AWG) may be used. In addition, wireless communication between the assembly 400 and the source 100 may also be employed as desired, e.g., via radio-frequency identification (“RFID”). In one suitable embodiment, the assembly 400 may include two or more colored LED 411 for indicating various operation information as desired. For example, one red LED and one blue LED may be used to indicate certain operation information to one or more persons through the window member 412 (see for example FIG. 31). In a non-limiting example of the assembly 400 including the conveyance of light there through, a blinking red LED may indicate a fault, a blinking blue LED may indicate active UV propagation and a solid red LED may indicate active visible light propagation. A suitable window member 412 may be constructed from glass, one or more polymeric materials, synthetic quartz, and combinations thereof. In addition, the window member 412 may be form fit within an opening on the main body 420, held in place via one or more adhesive materials or snap fit as desired. Without limiting the means of production, a suitable overmold member 404 and main body 420 may be formed via molds, e.g., injection molding, overmold member 404 and the main body 420 being constructed from one or more materials as described below. For human use, one or more bio-approved polymeric materials may be used to construct the overmold member 404 and main body 420 as desired. For example, in the United States of America, one or more bio-approved polymeric materials may include materials as approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) at such time. In addition, the overmold member 404 and/or the interconnect member 402 may be reused or disposable following a single use as desired or as otherwise required. As understood by the skilled artisan, the treatment device 106 and assemblies 200, 300, 400 discussed above may be constructed from any material durable enough to perform one or more treatments over one or more durations as described herein. In particular, the treatment device 106 and assembly component parts may be constructed of materials including but not necessarily limited to those materials resistant to chipping, cracking, excessive bending and reshaping as a result of ozone, weathering, heat, moisture, other outside mechanical and chemical influences, as well as various impacts and other loads placed on the treatment device 106 and assembly component parts. Likewise, the treatment device 106 and assembly component parts may be constructed from one or more materials durable enough to withstand one or more of boiling, autoclaving, dry heat sterilization, flaming, detergent washing, bathing via an acid bath and combinations thereof for purposes of reuse of the treatment device 106 and assembly component parts. Also, the treatment device 106 and assembly component parts may comprise any color or combination of colors, or in the alternative, the treatment device 106 may be wholly or partly transparent and translucent depending on individual preferences and needs. Suitable treatment device 106 and assembly component parts materials may include, but are not necessarily limited to metals, polymeric materials, rubbers, glass, plexiglass, filled composite materials, woods, minerals, and combinations thereof. Suitable polymeric materials may include, but are not necessarily limited to thermoplastics, synthetic plastics, semi-synthetic organic plastics, and combinations thereof Exemplary plastics may include, but are not necessarily limited to nylon, vinyl polymers and polyvinyl chloride (“PVC”), polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”), polymethylpentene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, and combinations thereof In one particular embodiment, the treatment device 106 and assembly component parts may be constructed from one or more polymeric materials and one or more pro-degradant additives effective to provide a degradable treatment device 106 and assembly component parts. Suitable pro-degradant materials may include, but are not necessarily limited to one or more transition metal salts. Without limiting the invention to a particular mode, the treatment device 106 and assembly component parts may be produced via one or more processes including, but not necessarily limited to assembly of various parts, injection molding, blow molding, thermoforming, rotational molding, compression molding, three-dimensional printing, film and sheet extrusion, and pipe and cable extrusion as each is understood by a skilled artisan. A suitable waveguide 102 or radiant energy conduit is effective to guide or otherwise convey electromagnetic radiation there through at one or more rates of attenuation as desired. For the purposes of this application, suitable waveguides 102 may include, but are not necessarily limited to liquid light guides, glass optical fibers, plastic optical fibers, photonic-crystal fibers (“PCF”), and combinations thereof. Suitable liquid light guides may include any desired liquid transmissive fluid encapsulated therein as desired. For the purposes of this application, liquid light guides are operationally configured to convey radiant energy from about 200 nm to about 2000 nm. Suitable glass optical fibers may be constructed from materials including, but not necessarily limited to silica glass, e.g., germanosilicate or aluminosilicate glass, fluoride glass, e.g., fluorozirconate and fluoroaluminate, chalcogenide glass, phosphate glasses, crystalline materials such as sapphire, and combinations thereof. Suitable plastic optical fibers may be constructed from materials including, but not necessarily limited to poly(methyl methacrylate) (“PMMA”).

Such configuration results in about 25.0% of the optical power from each LED making it to the beam splitter as such is understood by the skilled artisan. Mechanical and optical data for suitable fibers, including Polymicro optical fibers, is commercially provided by Molex Incorporated; (3) Fused Silica UV Lenses (inside a collimator): The light emitted from the fiber is collimated for transmission through the beam-splitter. There is a reciprocating collimator on the output side of the beam-splitter used to focus the light back into the output fiber. Information on the UV grade fused silica and plano convex lenses that may be employed herein is commercially available from Edmund Optics, Inc.; (4) UV Short Pass Filter: A dichroic filter may be used to combine the visible LED and UV-LEDs. Suitably, the wavelengths that are not transmitted are reflected; (5) Visible LED and LED optic: As understood by the skilled artisan a CREE Cool White LED may be used as is commercially available from Cree, Inc. Another bright single die LED may be used as desired. Suitably, an acrylic injection molded lens is used to collimate the light from the LED, this reflects from the beam-splitter and is focused into the output fiber; and (6) Feedback Photodiode: A feedback photodiode may be used to measure the output of the UV-LEDs and calibrate the power output prior to every usage or treatment using the radiation source. As understood by the skilled artisan, the photodiode receives a small reflection from the beam splitter.
