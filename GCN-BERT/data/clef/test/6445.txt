Botanical designation: Pelargonium zonale. Cultivar denomination: ‘DUEVICO13’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Zonal Geranium plant, botanically known as Pelargonium zonale, and hereinafter referred to by the name ‘Duevico13’. The new Zonal Geranium plant is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in Rheinberg, Germany. The objective of the breeding program is to create new vigorous Zonal Geranium plants with numerous attractive flowers. The new Zonal Geranium plant originated from a cross-pollination made by the Inventor in July, 2002 in Rheinberg, Germany of a proprietary selection of Pelargonium zonale identified as code number Z04-1621-002, not patented, as the female, or seed, parent with a proprietary selection of Pelargonium zonale identified as code number Z98-1045-001, not patented, as the male, or pollen, parent. The new Zonal Geranium plant was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant from within the progeny of the stated cross-pollination in a controlled greenhouse environment in Rheinberg, Germany in May, 2012. Asexual reproduction of the new Zonal Geranium plant by vegetative terminal cuttings in a controlled greenhouse environment in Rheinberg, Germany since June, 2012 has shown that the unique features of this new Zonal Geranium plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Plants of the new Zonal Geranium have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions and cultural practices. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environmental conditions such as temperature and light intensity without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘Duevico13’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘Duevico13’ as a new and distinct Zonal Geranium plant: 1. Upright plant habit.2. Vigorous growth habit.3. Freely basal branching habit.4. Freely flowering habit.5. Large salmon-colored semi-double flowers.6. Good garden performance. Plants of the new Zonal Geranium differ primarily from plants of the female parent selection in flower color as plants of the female parent selection have more pinkish-colored flowers. Plants of the new Zonal Geranium differ primarily from plants of the male parent selection in branching habit as plants of the new Zonal Geranium are more freely branching than plants of the male parent selection. Plants of the new Zonal Geranium can be compared to plants of the Pelargonium zonale ‘Fishelen’, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 12,727. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Rheinberg, Germany, plants of the new Zonal Geranium differed primarily from plants of ‘Fishelen’ in the following characteristics: 1. Plants of the new Zonal Geranium were larger than plants of ‘Fishelen’.2. Plants of the new Zonal Geranium were more freely flowering than plants of ‘Fishelen’.3. Plants of the new Zonal Geranium had larger flowers than plants of ‘Fishelen’.4. Plants of the new Zonal Geranium and ‘Fishelen’ differed slightly in flower color. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH The accompanying colored photograph illustrates the overall appearance of the new Zonal Geranium plant showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photograph may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describe the colors of the new Zonal Geranium plant. The photograph comprises a side perspective view of a typical flowering plant of ‘Duevico13’ grown in a container. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The aforementioned photograph and following observations and measurements describe plants grown during the summer in 12-cm containers in a glass-covered greenhouse in Rheinberg, Germany and under cultural practices typical of commercial Pelargonium production. During the production of the plants, day and night temperatures averaged 18° C. and light levels averaged 4,500 lux. Plants were pinched one time three weeks after planting and were 13 weeks old when the photograph and the description were taken. In the detailed description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, 1995 Edition, except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
