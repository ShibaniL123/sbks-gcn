Therapeutic conjugates with sulfated dendrimers for intracellular targeting Field of the invention The present invention relates to novel dendrimer conjugates, methods for their preparation and their use for treatment of diseases. The invention discloses a new method for the delivery of dendrimer conjugates with therapeutically active molecules into the cell by utilizing transport proteins enabling uptake of the inventive dendrimer conjugates and interaction of these therapeutically active molecules with molecules relevant for disease directly within the cell. Background During the last decades much progress has been made to improve the efficacy of diagnostic and therapeutic drugs. Several strategies were followed during the last decades to avoid severe unwanted drug effects on healthy tissues and organs. Predominantly, drug research was focused on new drug targets that promised a disease-specific expression of the target mechanism. With respect to the discovery of signal transduction mechanisms in proliferating and activated cells, numerous new targets have been identified. However, with few exceptions therapeutic attack of the majority of newly discovered drug targets remained less effective, since the therapeutic molecule has to possess the physicochemical properties to penetrate tissues, membrane barriers and cells to reach the target, in particular when the target is expressed inside of cells. Thus, much effort has been devoted to improve the bioavailability of clinically established therapeutic drugs. In order to improve bioavailability drug research focused on the chemical modification or pharmaceutical formulations of the therapeutic molecules. The majority of therapeutic drag molecules does not reach the site of the disease and are only applied into the human body in order to achieve necessary drug concentration in the blood, thereby not having a certain degree of selectivity for diseased tissues. Therefore, the utmost portion of the applied drug is eliminated from blood circulation without reaching the site of the disease. Many therapeutic molecules based on proteins and peptides are used as highly specific and effective therapeutic agents. Their use is, however, complicated by their physicochemical properties, which is due to the inherently polar nature of the amino acid composition and polypeptide backbone of polar amide connections. In particular, their molecular size and charge of the proteins hamper bioavailability at the desired target. The application of therapeutic proteins is further complicated by the circumstance that many protein and peptide drugs have their therapeutic targets inside cells. Here, the major challenge to be addressed in order to find new drugs or drug delivery technologies is the permeation of the cell membrane to bring these types of drugs into the cytoplasm or nucleus of the target cells. It is well known that single molecules with a molecular weight greater tha 1 kDa do not enter the cytoplasm, directly. Many diagnostic molecules, such as fluorescent dyes, contrast agents for Magnetic resonance imaging, CT, and radiochelates for nuclear imaging, are of hydrophilic nature and are not capable to enter the cell, similarly to the above described properties of polypeptides (van der Molen AJ, Eur. J. Radiol. 2008, 66, 168). Thus, there is no general pathway available, which permits to select a diagnostic agent for the purpose to characterize intracellular pathways of disease and detect the interaction of therapeutic molecules with intracellular molecules. Traditional methods of intracellular delivery are electroporation or microinjection of proteins. Here, the intactness of the cell membrane is disturbed for a short period of time enabling the intracellular delivery of macromolecules with a size of greater I kDa. However, the method is invasive and only applicable for in vitro experiments, but not for clinical conditions. Another disadvantage is the low efficacy of the procedure which can be measured by the number of tumour cells loaded with the target protein. Electroporation or microinjection usually leads to intracellular delivery in about 20 - 40 % of the treated cells but the reproducibility is very low. Most recently, novel pharmaceutical approaches have been established in order to deliver therapeutic polypeptides, proteins and antibodies into tumour cells. Pharmaceutical nanocarriers, such as liposomes, self-assembly micellar systems, or polymeric nanoparticles can be used for intracellular delivery of therapeutic proteins (Du et al., Curr Drug Metab, 2012, 13, 82-92). They are able to escape endosomal metabolism but lack specificity to the tumour cell. In this regard, targeting ligands can be used to direct such nanocarriers towards tumour cells. However, liposomal and other nanoparticular formulations carrying therapeutic polypeptides, antibodies, and proteins in combination with targeting ligands (van der Meel et al., Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2013, 65, 1284-98) are costly and considered as complex chemical entities. The optimization of these entities is often complicated due to the fact that the interaction between carrier material and therapeutic payload has to be carefully adapted. With respect to diagnostic payloads, the physicochemical properties of the diagnostic agent has to be carefully adapted to the carrier in a similar way to receive functional chemical entities. Albeit the opportunities of pharmaceutical combination with nanoparticular carrier systems, the use of proteins and peptides as therapeutic agents is hampered per se by the whole set of their intrinsic properties associated with their nature as complex macromoleculcs, which are, as a rule, foreign to the recipient organism. This leads to low stability of the majority f peptide and especially protein drugs at physiological pH values and temperatures, particularly when these proteins have to be active in the environment different from their normal one. Different processes leading to the inactivation of various biologically active proteins and peptides in vivo include conformational protein transformation into inactive form due to the effect of temperature, pll, high salt concentration or detergents. Very often, aggregation of proteins leads to loss of function and metabolism, which is difficult to exactly determine in pharmaceutical nanocarrier systems. Solution to the problem underlying the present invention The inventors of the present application have surprisingly found a methodology of delivering therapeutic molecules, particularly polypeptides, specifically into cells of disease. The solution to the problem is based on a surprising finding that such polypeptides and proteins can be delivered into tumour cells without a pharmaceutical formulation based on nanoparticlcs, polymers, micelles or liposomes. Instead, it was found that a group of compounds based on defined dendrimers covalently linked to the therapeutic effector is capable of being transported as dendrimer conjugate into the target cell. In particular, it was found that the type of dendrimer carrying a defined plurality of sulfate groups (-OSO3" M+) can act as active transporter moiety, when this dendrimer is covalently connected to the respective therapeutic polypeptide or other type of effector, including therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Subject-matter of the present invention is the provision of dendrimer conjugates, methods for their preparation and their use for treatment and diagnosis of diseases. Therapeutic and diagnostic molecules that are inperm cable to cells are hampered from being taken up into normal cells and are directed only to those cells which have uptake mechanisms based on transmembrane solute carriers, thereby improving selectivity and decreasing toxicity to the organism. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, by the present invention, dendrimer conjugates are provided that enable transmembrane delivery of therapeutically active molecules via transport proteins. It was found that therapeutically active molecules as well as diagnostic molecules that are as single copounds alone not capable of being taken up into cells due to the properties described above, are surprinsingly applicable for being transported into cells and exhibiting a therapeutic or diagnostic effect directly within the cell. Moreover, specific targeting to the cells in the organism is enabled by the dendrimer conjugates of the invention. In this context, the defined dendrimer conjugates enable the improvement of the bioavailability and selectivity of a broad spectrum of therapeutic and diagnostic effector molecules, including polypeptides as well as small molecule therapeutics. Therapeutic and diagnostic molecules that are not capable of entering cells are transported into cells utilizing transport proteins. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, this could be achieved by the homogeneity of the molecular weight of each dendrimer within the claimed conjugates, in combination with the covalent conjugation between the effector molecules and sulfated dendrimcrs. A pharmaceutical formulation with the therapeutic molecule physically embedded or encapsulated in a carrier particle or polymer (without covalent bonding to the carrier) has shown the disadvantage that the therapeutic effector molecules can redistribute in the organism by carrier decomposition and/or leakage from the carrier, thereby exhibiting its parent toxicity to the organism. Accordingly, diagnostic molecules can redistribute and thereby generating signals which make the examiner detect the wrong molecular situation not connected with the uptake mechanism. Detailed description of the invention The described features of the invention are substantiated by the following descriptions of exemplary embodiments which arc presented in order to support the invention and are not intended to be limiting thereof. Subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of the formula E-[G-L-D(OS03"M')„]m , wherein E is a therapeutic or diagnostic effector molecule, wherein DfOS VM * )n is a dendrimer D carrying a number n of sulfate groups OS03"M\ wherein the number n of sulfate groups is selected from 6 to 96, wherein M is a cationic inorganic or organic counter ion to the anionic sulfate group, wherein L is a linker or spacer between D and E, wherein G is a connecting functional group forming the attachment between L and E, and wherein m is an integer from 1 to 20. In a preferred embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate comprising a polysulfated dendrimer D and a therapeutic or diagnostic effector molecule E that is covalcntly conjugated to said polysulfated dendrimer. In a more preferred embodiment, the subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of the formula E-[G-L-D(OS03TVl+)n]m, wherein each of the dendrimers D of said conjugate has the same molecular weight. Within the embodiment, the dendrimer structures have a defined and unique molecular weight. The means the resulting conjugate is not composed of many different dendritic molecules each having another structure, branching, size, charge, volume or polarity, which is the result of a polymeric nature. In WO2011/095311, the use of conjugates of therapeutic proteins with sulfated polyols is described, wherein these sulfated polyols are of polymeric nature with a non-defined molecular weight. They are characterized by an average molecular weight based on polydispersity, with statistical conjugation with therapeutic molecules. It was surprisingly found that a defined dendrimer system (24, 32 or 48 sulfate groups) with defined linker conjugated to a toxin protein leads to higher efficacy in treating tumor cells in cell culture when compared to a polydisperse polyglycerolsulfate of comparable average molecular weight (see Example 19). Suprisinigly and unexpectedly, another advantage of using defined dendrimer systems of single molecular weight in comparison to polymeric sulfated polyglycerol could be identified by the present invention. After labeling with a fluorescent dye (ICC), yielding for example compounds of Example 8 (ICC-dOl, ICC-dl2, ICC-dl8), cellular uptake studies were conducted in comparison to polymeric ICC-polyglycerolsulfate (average molecular weight 12000 Da). ICC-dOl, ICC-dl2, ICC-d l8 resulted in an intracellular distribution in the cytosol, whereas polymeric ICC-polyglycerol sul fate showed substantial localization additionally in endosomal compartments, probably due to partial endoeytotic uptake o the polymeric mixture. Endoeytotic uptake for polymers becomes predominant above 20 kDa, as also described in WO2011/095311 for sulfated polymers. In general, uptake of therapeutic proteins by the endosomal compartment needs to be circumvented for major reasons. First, the endosomal membrane represents a barrier for the translocation of therapeutic effector molecules towards the cytosol. Usually, therapeutic effector molecules become not available at the therapeutic target molecules in the cytosol. Second, many metabolizing and catalytic enzymes may destroy the therapeutic effector molecules before they can be translocated to the cytosol. This aspect is of particular importance for protein therapeutic effector molecules. The synthesis of po 1 ygl y cero 1 s ul fates involving anionic ring-opening polymerization to synthesize the polyglycerol backbone is published state-of-the-art usually leading to a certain molecular weight distribution around an average molecular weight Mn with a polydispersity index of 15 - 1.8 (Groger et al, Bioconjug. Chem. 2013, 24, 1507-14). Thus, for an average molecular weight M„ within 5 10 kDa with a polydispersity index of 1.5 1.8 has always a substantial amount of higher molecular weight structures (> 20 kDa) in the mixture which are difficult to quantify. Accordingly, in Example 18, a clear independency from endocytosis is apparent only for protein conjugates with sulfated dendrimers (Asp-d02) and not for conjugates with polyglycerolsul fate. Furthermore, a person skilled in the art is aware of the methods to prove that each dendrimer has the same molecular weight, e.g. llI-NMR spectroscopy, 13C-NMR spectroscopy, elementary analysis, mass spectroscopy that are classical techniques of organic chemistry. In a specific embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of the formula E-[G-L-D(OSOyM *"),,],„ , wherein the number n of sulfate groups is the same for each dendrimer D. Therefore, each dendrimer of said conjugate can only encompass one selected number n of sulfate groups, for example only 6 r only 8 or only 12 or only 16 sulfate groups, whereby the number n of sulfate groups is selected from 6 to 96. Further subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein the sulfate groups OSO-jTvT arc preferably derived from hydroxy! groups which are converted into sulfate groups (monosters of sulfonic acid) by a sulfation process. Preferred agents to conduct a sulfation process of hydroxyl groups arc complexes of sulfurtrioxide (such as S03 -pyridine complex, S03-triethylamine complex, S03- trimethylamine complex, SO3-DMF complex) or sulfamic acid (Mol J A et al., Carbohydr Res. 2003 338:1397-401). In another embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein the repeating units of monomers to build the dendritic structure are selected from the group comprising 1,2-substituted glycerol, 1,3-substituted glycerol, pentaerythritol, glucose, mannosc. galactose, lysine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, tris(propionic acid)aminomethane, l, -bis(hydroxymethyI)-propionic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, maleic acid, glycolic acid, diglycolic acid, adipic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, propionic acid (2-aminoethyl)amide, propyleneimine, ethyleneimine, propyleneoxidc, ethyleneoxide. In another specific embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein the connection of monomers in the dendrimer is based on functional groups selected from ether, thioethcr, carboxylic ester, sulfonyl ester, sulfonamide, earboxylamide, amine, carbamate, thiocarbamate, urea, thiourea, hydra/one, imine, disulfide, phosphate. phosphonate, triazole, acetal, ketal. In another embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of the formula E-[G-L-D(OS03~M+)i,]m wherein the dendrimer D contains a central dendrimer core unit (CDCU) with the covalent attachment f a linker unit. The CDCU comprise structures selected from pentaerythritol, glycerol, tri glycerol, glycerolamine, tris(propionic acid)methyl, tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl, tetraoxaspiro(5.5)undecane, adamantyl. Preferred are structures, wherein central dendrimer core units (CDCU) with the covalent attachment of a linker unit comprise structures such as pentaerythritol, glycerol, triglyeerol, glycerolamine, tris(propionic acid)mcthyl and structures as depicted below. Subject-matter in another specific embodiment of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein D contains terminal groups selected froml ,2-disul atoalkyh 1 ,3-disulfatoalkyl, Ν,Ν'- di(l-sulfatoalkyl)amine, tris( sul fatom ethyl )me(hyl , 1 ,2,4-trisulfato-3-alkyl. 1 ,2,3,4,5- pentasulfatoalkyl derived from glucosamine. To achieve a high density of sulfate groups, their position at a ky moieties has to be such that they are in close proximity to each other. This can be achieved by structural motifs of 1 ,2- disulfatoalkyl, 1 ,3-disulfatoalkyl, N,N5-di(l -sulfatoethyl)amine. There are different structures possible which comprise 1 ,2-disulfato- or 1 ,3-disulfato structural motifs. Under such structures fall also sugar or glycan moieties which, after sulfation, comprise also the 1 ,2- disulfato- or 1,3-disulfato units within the structure. Mono-, di- or oligoglycane moieties are possible, and within these structures, cyclic or open chain (reduced) structures are possible. Scope of the invention includes 1 ,2.3 ,4,5-pentahydroxyhexyl structures derived from hexose (glucose, galactose, mannose) sugars, such as glucosamine or glucamine. D-glueamine can be used in dendnmer systems leading to 5 sulfate groups per glucamine residue. Another scope includes cyclodextrins (a, B or γ-cyelodextrins), which are monofunctionali/ed (such as 6- deoxy-6-azido-cyclodextrins or other functional groups known to the skilled person; Roux M et al., Eur Biophys J. 2007, 36, 861 -7) to connect the linker L, and can be modified at each hydroxyl group with glycerol followed by sulfation. Thus, in a preferred embodiment subject-matter of the present invention are dendrimers D with a terminal 1 ,2,3,4,5-pcntasulfato unit, which is derived from sugars, preferably glucosamine, dendrimers D with terminal 1 ,2-disulfato unit, which is derived from smaller hydroxylated units comprising glycerol structures, dendrimers D with terminal 1 ,3-disulfato units derived from bis-(hydroxymethyl) alkyl moieties. More preferred as structural entity in D is the 1.2-disulfatoalkyl structure based on a terminal 1 -substituted 1 ,2-disulfatopropyl which is derived from a glycerol unit. Within the context of this embodiment, 1 ,2-substituted glycerol means that two adjacent hydroxyl groups are forming a connection to the subsequent monomer unit of the next generation shell in the dendrimers structure. 1,3 -substituted glycerol means that the two outer hydroxyl group form this connection. n a preferred embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein D contains sulfate groups, wherein sulfate groups are particularly preferred over sulfonate and carboxylate groups which are known to be used in dendritic polymers and dendrimers (Weinhart et al., Biomacromolecules. 201 1 , 12, 2502). As published, sulfonate and carboxylate groups can be introduced into dendrimer molecules by modifying hydroxyl or amino goups with e.g. suecinyl anhydride, bromoacetic acid, 1 ,3-propanesultone, 1 .4- butansultone. Surprisingly, sulfate dendrimers exhibit more efficient cellular uptake (detected with fluorcsccntly labeled conjugates) also for smaller molecular weights (number of anionic group < 24) compared to carboxylate and sulfonate groups. In a more specific embodiment, the subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein the linker unit L is covalently attached to dendrimer D. In another very specific embodiment, the subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein the linker unit L is covalently bound to the focal point of the dendrimer D at a position, whereby from this focal point, the dendrimer is grown to reach its dendritic structure. Further subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of the formula E-[G-L-D(OSOyM )„]m , wherein L is a C4_ioo-alkyl group. In one embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of the formula E-[G-L-D(OS03~M+)„]m, wherein L is a Ci-ioo-alkyl group, wherein the CVioo-alkyl group is selected from the group consisting of aliphatic cyclic, branched or linear units in which one or more methylene groups may independently be replaced by a unit selected from the group consisting of O, S.

In a preferred embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of the formula E-[G-L-D(OS03"M+)n]m, wherein L is a C4.5o-alkyl group in which one to ten, methylene groups are be replaced by a group selected from the group comprising O, C(=0)NH, OC(=0)NH, OC(=0)0, NHC(=0)NH, NHC(=S)NH, triazole. wherein X is NH or O, and a, b and c can be independently 0 or 1 (a+b+c = 0 excluded). In a more preferred embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of the formula E - [ G - L- D( OSOYM + )n ] ni , wherein L is alkyl including a C4 to Ci8 carbon chain, a unit C(=0)NH and a short PEG chain up to 10 repeating units of CH2CH20, to which a connecting group G is placed at the end of this chain as a reactive group for covalent conjugation to E. In a specific embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of the formula E-[G-L-D(OSOyM s )n]m, wherein L comprises structures which are cleavable under intracellular conditions, wherein the cleavable structures are selected from the group of disulfide (S-S), acid-clcavablc structures CH=N, CH=N-NH, CH=N-NHC(=0), C N-O, in which any nitrogen or carbon atom may be substituted with ethyl or methyl. Another structure which is cleavable under intracellular conditions comprises amino acid sequences of 2 to 10 amino acids. In a more specific embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of the formula E-[G-L-D(OS03"M+)n]m, wherein L comprises structures which exhibit an optical absorption peak in the UV to VIS spectral range within 280 and 650 nm, preferably between 300 and 550 nm. In an even more specific embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of the formula E-[ G-L-D(OS03"M )n]m, wherein L comprises structures employing at least two aromatic or bisaromatic moieties, such as biphenyl, naphthyl, diben/oketone. dansyl, pyrene, perylene, coumarin, 4,4-dilluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene, or cyanine dye, prefably indocarbocyani nc or monomethine chromophore moieties. The spectroscopic quantification allows the determination of dendrimer-to-protein/polypeptide ratios. Examples of UV to VIS detectable structures of L connected to D are described in Example 9 and 10. Further subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of the formula E-[G-L-D(OSOy M+)n]m, wherein E is a therapeutic or diagnostic effector molecule. The use o a sulfated dendrimer covalently conjugated with a fluorescent dye is described by Paulus et al. (Macromol. Biosci. 2014, 14, 643-654). The [G4.0] -dendrimer is derived from a polyol o 64 hydroxy groups, to which statistically a linker is conjugated, followed by sulfation and labelling with a dye. This design yields a non-perfect structure, as the linker moiety cannot be placed exactly in a 1 : 1 ratio at a desired position. The publication shows uptake of these and polymeric polysulfate of lesser branching degree into tumor cells and teaches optimal uptake with a moderate branching degree of 60% (a non-perfect dendrimer structure). There is no information on the mechanism of uptake and whether a transport cr- mediated pathway can be utilized to transport therapeutically active molecules in order to make them available for an intracellular interaction with molecular mechanisms of disease. In a specific embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of the formula E-[G-L-D(OS03~M ! )„],„, wherein E is a therapeutic effector molecule. In another embodiment, subject-matter of the invention is a conjugate, wherein the effector molecule comprises substances which may interfere with intracellular mechanisms of proliferation, apoptosis, synthesis of connective tissue material (e.g. collagen, fibronectin), immune function, senescence, or immune defence. More specifically, the interference with intracellular mechanisms of disease comprises a conjugate of sul ated dendrimers and therapeutic molecules for the use in treatment of cells by transporting the conjugate into the cell and thereby localizing the therapeutic effector molecule E within the cell, where this molecule E interacts directly with molecular mechanisms of disease. This interaction is based on a direct binding to molecules within the ceil thereby inducing disturbance of or changes within biological signal pathways. The binding is defined the binding strength or binding affinity which depends on the molecular nature and structure of the therapeutic effector molecule (as further substantiated in sections below). In a more preferred embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of sulfated dendrimers and therapeutic molecules for the use in treatment of cells which have uptake mechanisms based on transport proteins from the group of transmembrane solute carriers, that enable transmembrane delivery of therapeutically active molecules via transmembrane solute carriers into cells. These transmembrane solute carriers comprise preferably organic anion transporter proteins (OATPs; Liu T et al., J. Drug Target. 2014,22, 14-22). A preferred embodiment are OATPs with tumor-specific expression, including OATP1B1, OA TP I B or NTCP (Buxhofer-Ausch et al., J Drug Deliv. 2013, 863539). In a more preferred embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of sulfated dendrimers and therapeutic molecules for the use in treatment and diagnosis of cancer, wherein said conjugates of sulfated dendrimers and therapeutic molecules are directed against molecular targets in cancer cells. Cancer cell types comprise preferably high expression of OATP 1 B 1 , OATP1B3 or NTCP, for the treatment of cancer such as pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, CNS cancer, melanoma, colon cancer, skin cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer, hepatic cancer. Another preferred embodiment is treatment of cancer stem cells which often express high levels of OATP I B I , OATP 1B3 or NTCP. Thus, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of sulfated dendrimers and therapeutic molecules for the use in treatment and diagnosis of disease, wherein said conjugates of sulfated dendrimers and therapeutic molecules are taken up into cells by transporter proteins and interact inside the cell with molecular mechanisms of disease. Even more preferred is a conjugate of sulfated dendrimers and therapeutic molecules for the use in treatment of cells which have uptake mechanisms based on transport proteins from the group of transmembrane solute carriers and that arc otherwise not capable of taking up said therapeutic molecules (see also example 18). Surprisingly, therapeutic effector molecules can be accumulated or enriched within the target cell based on the mechanism of uptake of the conjugates by transporter proteins what has not been possible before as these therapeutic molecules are not capable to reach the target molecule to which it exhibits a binding affinity. Thus, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of sulfated dendrimers and therapeutic molecules for the use in treatment and diagnosis of disease, wherein said conjugates of sul fated dendrimers and therapeutic molecules are taken up into cells by transporter proteins, interact inside the cell with molecular mechanisms of disease, and accumulate in the cell due to a binding affinity of the therapeutic effector molecule to an intracellular target molecule. Intracellular targets are further substantiated below. In another specific embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein the effector molecules are selected from the group comprising small molecules, peptides, proteins, gl yeans, nucleic acids. Preferred are effector molecules of these classes which are not taken up into cells on its own. In another very specific embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein the small molecule is selected from the group comprising peptide or peptidomimetic structures, including cyclic or open-chain peptides with natural or non-natural structural modifications. It was surprisingly shown that hydrophilic peptides with no uptake into cells can by localized within tumor cells after conjugation to dendrimers of the present invention. In another very specific embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein the proteins are selected from the group comprising globular proteins, glycoproteins. toxins, enzymes, antibodies, antibody fragments, engineered antibody and protein constructs, including single domain antibodies (sdAb), single chain Fv antibodies (scFv), single chain- Fv-Fc antibodies (scFv-Fc).

Particularly preferred are antibody mimetics selected from the group of affibodies, affilins, avimers. antikalHns, Darpins, kunitz domains, fynobodies, polypeptides generated from the type III domain of fibronectin. In another very specific embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein the nucleic acids include RNA, DNA, siRNA, niRNA, antisense-RNA, microR A or engineered formats, such as aptamers. In another specific embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein E is directed against molecules involved in proliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells. More specifically, these molecules are localized within the tumor cell, preferably within the cytosol of tumor cells. In another very specific embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein E is selected from the group comprising polypeptides or small molecular effector molecules that bind targets such as FoxOl, HDAC, DP-1, E2F, ABL, AMPK, BRK, BRSK I, BRSK2, BTK, CAMKK1, CAMKK alpha, CAMKK beta, Rb, Suv39HI, SCF, p19INK4D, GSK-3, pi 8 INK4. myc, cyclin E, CDK2, CDK9, CDG4/6, Cycline D, pl6 INK4A, cdc25A, BMI1, SCF, Akt, CHKl/2, C 1 delta, CK1 gamma, C 2, CLK2, CSK, DDR2, DYRK1A/2/3, EF2K, EPH-A2/A4/B1/B2/B3/B4, EIF2A 3, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, Smad7, p53, p21 Cipl, PAX, Fyn, CAS, C3G, SOS, Tal, Raptor, RACK-1, CRK, Rapl, Rac, KRas, NRas, HRas, GRB2.

More specifically, the target catenin exhibits transcriptional activity which is based on the interaction with several cofactors and adaptor proteins in order to form a transcription factor complex. The catenin transcription complex represents several protein-protein interactions that can be used as therapeutic targets. Peptide motifs derived from the amino acid sequence of interacting protein structures, such as alpha-helices or beta-sheets, can be used as therapeutic lead structures.

Increasing knowledge on toxin structures and mechanism of action leads to novel chemical entities which are now in preclinical and clinical research. Most natural protein toxins can be divided into three major groups, (1) toxins that damage the cell by disrupting membrane integrity, (2) toxins that disrupt the normal electrical activity of the nervous system of the intoxicated organism, (3) toxins that disrupt or interfere with cellular processes and may affect the target cells by enzymatic or non-enzymatic activities. Some members of the third group are extremely toxic polypeptides that have the capability of self translocation into the cell cytoplasm where they execute their activity that, in most cases, leads to death of the intoxicated cell. However, clinical application f engineered toxins still faces many challenges. Two major problems associated with systemic administration of immunotoxins are (1) lack of specificity resulting from the presence of the target antigen/receptor also being present on healthy tissue and (2) undesired intoxication of healthy tissue due to the immunotoxin binding to cell surface components rather than specifically to its target antigen/receptor ("target mdependent toxicity"). Thus, in one embodiment, subject-matter of the present application are conjugates of the formula E-[G-L-D(OS03~M+)n]m, with toxic polypeptides or toxins for the treatment of proliferative disease by intracellular delivery of these types of therapeutic effectors. In another specific embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein the sulfated dendrimers are chemically conjugated to antibodies, antibody fragments or engineered proteins and enable intracellular delivery into proliferative cells such as tumor cells and inflammatory activated cells. In a preferred embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate, wherein the therapeutic effector molecules E have a molecular weight equal to or below 100 kDa, more preferred below 80 kDa, even more preferred below 60 kDa, which can be achieved by conjugation of sulfated dendrimers with antibody fragments selected from scFv, scFv2, Fab, single domain antibody, minibody, bite antibody, or diabody, and most preferred below 40 kDa. which can be achieved by conjugation of sulfated dendrimers with antibody fragments selected from scFv, single domain antibody, or synthetic small molecular weight peptides. Within the group of synthetic peptides, these are open-chain peptides, cyclic peptides via N/C-terminal cyclization, cyclic peptides via cystein-cystein (disulfide) cyclization and peptides with aliphatic cycles connected via unnatural amino acids (such as stapled peptides) of up to 25 amino acids, preferably up to 20 amino acids, more preferably up to 1 5 amino acids, most preferably up to 10 amino acids. Longer peptides up to 30 to 40 amino acids are also subject of the invention, particularly because additional amino acids can be employed for the purpose of spacing, introducing solubility, and imparting improved stability. Another embodiment within the above described synthetic peptides are preferably structure motifs derived from natural binding peptides involved in protein-protein interaction and employing sequences forming specific alpha-helices. Particularly, these alpha-helical peptide sequences are characterized by a certain helicity in solution, thereby generating binding affinity to other proteins. The required degree of helicity depends on the peptide structure applied (Bernal F et al.. Methods Mol. Biol. 2014, 1 1 76, 107-14), and can be measured by the skilled artisan, e.g. by CD- spectroscopy or H-NMR (Bonache MA et al, ACS Comb Sci. 2014, 16, 250-258). Helicity is given in [%]. Thus, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate of the formula E-[G-L-D(OS03~ M ' )„]in. wherein E is an alpha-helical peptide directed against protein-protein interactions or molecules involved in proliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells, wherein the conjugate is localized within the tumor cell, preferably within the cytosol of tumor cells. Preferred are conjugates with m is 1. Preferred are synthetic peptides of up to 40 amino acids, preferably up to 30 amino acids, more preferably up to 20 amino acids forming alpha-helix in aqueous solution. The alpha-helix can be stabilized by employing non-natural amino acids in the sequence, and/or by forming cyclic peptides (for instance, but not limited to, head-to-tail cyclization, disulfide cyclization, hydrocarbon stapling). Preferred values of helicity of these peptides are above 40%, more preferred above 60%, even more preferred above 80%. Comprised by the instant invention is also the surprising finding regarding the molecular weight of the therapeutic effector molecules, particularly from the group of polypeptides or proteins. It has been surprisingly found that sulfated dendrimers chemically conjugated to antibodies, antibody fragments or engineered proteins enable intracellular delivery into proliferative cells such as tumour cells. Antibodies of IgG type are proteins with an average molecular weight of 150 kDa and are usually not able to enter the cytoplasm. The degree of intracellular uptake of dendrimer antibody conjugates was investigated in a series of different tumour cell lines and was determined by FACS measurements as well as by fluorescence microscopy. It has been found that already 3 hours after starting incubation of tumour cells with dendrimer IgG conjugates, an intracellular uptake was present. The number of positive cells as well as the total degree of uptake increased by incubation of tumour cells with dendrimer IgG conjugates up to 24 hours. Furthermore, it has been surprisingly observed that the molecular weight of the protein therapeutics is critical in terms of uptake kinetics. In detail, dendrimer protein conjugates with a total molecular weight lower than 150 kDa demonstrate faster intracellular uptake and a higher degree of positive cells than complete IgG with a molecular weight of 150 kDa. Antibody fragments such as (Fab)2, scFv-Fc or diabody represent proteins with an average molecular weight of 100 - 120 kDa. The strongest Intracellular uptake is present with dendrimer protein conjugates with a molecular weight lower than 40 kDa, such as single domain antibodies (15 kDa). A skilled person can measure the degree of the intracellular uptake by tumour cells with FACS measurement at different time points after starting incubation (see also Example 15).

Nature Chem Biol., 2007, 1 1 , 707 ). The polypeptides are accessible via known technology of recombinant production or by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Thus, the embodiment comprises also a molar ratio m of dendrimer system G-L-D(OSCVM+)n to the polypeptide being exactly 1 due to site-directed conjugation, in contrary to the statistical conjugation giving average numbers for m, as described above. Preferred is the conjugation to thiol group of a cys-tag with maleimide forming a thioether, or pyridyldisulfide forming a disulfide for G, as well as the sortase- mediated enzymatic ligation for the sequence LPXTGG (e.g. with dendrimer d25), and the click-labeling of azides derived from azidohomoalanine. In a specific embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate according to Formula E-[G-L-D(OS03"M+)n]m, wherein the effector molecule E has a higher molecular weight than the conjugated sulfated dendrimer. A preferred embodiment comprises conjugates wherein E is based on a polypeptide which has an up to 20-fold higher molecular weight (in Dalton) related to the sum of molecular weight given by the number n of identical dendrimer units [G-L-D(OS03"M+)n]m conjugated to the polypeptide, more preferred an up to 10-fold molecular weight, even more preferred an up to 5-fold molecular weight. In another embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a conjugate according to Formula E-[G-L-D(OS03~ +)n]n,. wherein E is a therapeutic polypeptide from the class of enzymes that abolish indispensible nutrients or factors from the tumour cells cytosol. For example, dendrimer L-asparaginase conjugates were surprisingly found to act as strong antiproliferative agent in many tumour cell lines. So far, a skilled person was not able to deliver the therapeutic macromolecule I. -asparaginase into the tumour cell cytosol. However, this feature is of utmost importance as the majority of tumour cells can compensate lack o asparagines uptake by intracellular de novo synthesis. This includes also dendrimer protein conjugates targeting tumour metabolism. Preferred are enzyme proteins as therapeutic effector molecules such as glycosylases. hydrolases, pyruvate kinases, fumurate hydratases, hexokinases, aldolases, enolases. glucose phosphate isomerases. In a particularly preferred embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention according to Formula E-[G-L-D(OS03"M+)T1]m is a conjugate of dendrimer systems with L-asparaginase, which is a homotetramer, each of the four units providing one disulfide bridge for reduction and conjugation without loss of enzymatic function (Balan et a!., Bioconjugatc Chcm. 2007, 18, 61), see Example 12a for synthesis and Example 15 and 16 for biological data. In another embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is the use f protein A or protein G, which is available in different formats, including those employing a cystag. For example, dendrimers arc conjugated to rCys-proteinG (example 12c), mainlining the binding affinity f protein G to the Fc-structurc in murine or human IgG. Subject-matter of the invention are therefore dendrimer conjugates according to Formula E-[G-l.-D(OS03 M ')„],n, in which the therapeutic effector is an IgG antibody - protein A or protein G complex, with covalent conjugation of the sulfated dendrimer to protein A or G, using conjugation techniques as described above. The number m is preferably 1, 2 or 3, using one sulfated dendrimer at the protein A or G, and adjusting the ratio between IgG and dendrimer protein A/G by non-covalent assembly in solution. In a preferred embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a method for treating a disease as described above comprising the use of conjugates of sulfated dendrimers with therapeutic effector molecules according to Formula E-[G-L-D(OS03~ +)n]n„ wherein the therapeutic effector E is delivered to the cytosol. Even more preferred is this method, wherein the delivery to the cytosol occurs with linkers L being stable thereby not allowing release/cleavage of the therapeutic effector E from the sulfated dendrimer. The measurement of drug release from a carrier molecule can be done by methods known to the skilled person, e.g. described by Wakankar et al., MAbs 201 1 , 3, 161 -172, including methods of HPLC or mass spectroscopy used to analyse drug conjugates incubated in human serum. Within the embodiment, a preferred method is the herein described application with a stability of disclosed dendrimer conjugates, leading to free drug not more than preferably 10%, more preferably 5% of the conjugated amount ( 100 %), measured after 24 h incubation in hum aserum at 37°C by HPLC. In a preferred embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention is a method for treating a disease as described above comprising the use of conjugates of sulfated dendrimers with therapeutic effector molecules according to E-[G-L-D(OS03TVi+)n]m, wherein the therapeutic effector E is not applicable as drug alone without conjugation due to plasma and tissue concentrations at levels too toxic to the organism. These are preferably maytansine and analogues, auristatin and analogues, and staurosporine and analogues. Conjugates of sulfated dendrimers with these therapeutic molecules exhibit much lower toxicity to non-proliferating cells compared to the drug molecules alone. In the organism, low plasma levels of free drug are detected, when using a non-eleavable linker structure for L that stable under physiological conditions in the organism. Another aspect of the embodiment regards the therapeutic compounds E with respect to their property to exhibit only limited penetration into the cell without conjugation to sulfated dendrimer. These are usually the protein and polypeptide structures as described above, but also hydrophilic synthetic cytotoxic compounds. The example 15 shows, that the protein L- asparaginase do not show uptake into tumor cells, whereas L-asparaginase conjugated to sulfated dendrimer shows a substantially enhanced concentration inside tumor cells (table 5). Hence, upon dendrimer conjugation, cellular uptake is enhanced. Further subject-matter of the present invention is therefore a method, wherein 3-fold, preferably 5-fold, most preferably above 10-fold enhanced uptake occurs, with respect to the number of conjugate molecules of sulfated dendrimers with therapeutic effector molecules according to Formula E-[G-L- D(OS03 M ),,],„ localizing within the cell (e.g. measured in FACS using dye-labeled conjugates, see example 15) relative to non-conjugated therapeutic molecules E Within the scope of the present invention, the compounds according to Formula E-[ G-L-D(OSOi"M ' )n jm exhibit a cytotoxic effect on tumour cells, as also described within supporting examples. This effect can be quantified by an IC50 value in M [mol/L], as given for several examples. It is therefore also subject-matter of the present invention to provide a method for treating a disease as described above comprising the use of conjugates of sulfated dendrimers with therapeutic effector molecules according to said Formula by exhibiting an IC50 value in culture of tumour cells less than 10" M, preferably less than 10" M, more preferably less than 10"9 M. It is understood that this value can differ depending on the cell line used and the method of analysis (which can be cell proliferation analysed by MMT test, or cell counting of alive vs. dead cells). Among the group of proteins that act as binding reagents and usually applied to block protein- protein interaction, engineered polypeptide scaffolds are of strong significance. Polypeptide scaffolds represent polypeptides carrying a rigid natural polypeptide structure that can be used to modify an existing or to implement a new binding site for a molecular target. Usually, such a scaffold is derived from a robust and small soluble monomelic polypeptide (such as the Kunitz inhibitors or the lipocalins) or from a stably folded extramembrane domain of a cell surface receptor (e.g. protein A, fibronectin or the ankyrin repeat). Compared with antibodies or their recombinant fragments, these polypeptide scaffolds often provide practical advantages including elevated stability and high production yield in microbial expression systems, together with an independent intellectual property situation. As these binding polypeptide are obtained by means of a biomolecular engineering process in order to achieve tight target- binding activity, they may also be subjected to further selection schemes focused at other desired properties (such as solubility, thermal stability, protease resistance etc.). More than 50 different polypeptide scaffolds have been proposed over the past 10-15 years. The most advanced approaches in this field comprise the following polypeptide classes (1) affibodies based on the Z-domain f staphylococcal protein A, a three-helix bundle of 58 residues providing an interface on two of its a-hcliccs, (2) engineered Kunitz domains based on a small (ea. 58 residues) and robust, disulfidc-crosslinkcd serine protease inhibitor, typically of human origin (e.g. LACI-D1), which can be engineered for different protease specificities, (3) monobodies or adnectins based on the 10th extracellular domain of human fibronectin III (10Fn3), which adopts an Ig-like b-sandwich fold (94 residues) with 2 3 exposed loops, but lacks the central disulfide bridge, (4) anticalins derived from the lipocalins, a diverse family of eight- stranded b-barrel proteins (ca. 180 residues) that naturally form binding sites for small ligands by means of four structurally variable loops at the open end, which are abundant in humans, insects, and many other organisms, (5) DARPins, designed ankyrin repeat domains (166 residues), which provide a rigid interface arising from typically three repeated b-turns and, finally, a few other binding proteins based on more peculiar folds such as a multimerized LDLR-A module (Avimers or cysteine-rich knottin peptides). Besides many attractive properties of engineered scaffolds, they are hampered by their low molecular weight which leads to a fast elimination after intravenous injection. Further subject-matter of the present invention are conjugates of dendrimers and engineered polypeptides for intracellular delivery of the engineered polypeptides in order to interfere with mechanisms of tumour growth. In a preferred embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention are conjugates f sulfated dendrimers and engineered polypeptides, wherein the polypeptides are dendrimcr affibody conjugates, dendrimer kunitz conjugates, dendrimcr anticalin conjugates, dendrimer affilin conjugates, dendrimer monobody (adnectin) conjugates, dendrimer DARPIN conjugates and dendrimer peptide conjugates. In a particularly preferred embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention arc conjugates of dcndrimcr and engineered proteins which exert high binding affinity to the therapeutic target in the picomolar range and high stability such as DARPins. it is known to a skilled person that engineered scaffold polypeptides can be synthesized and expressed as dimers or multimers of more than 3 polypeptide chains with target binding to the identical antigen, as well as similar or different antigens. Hereby, an increase of circulatory half-life in the blood and an increase of the strength of the target binding can be achieved. Conjugates of dendrimers and dimeric or multiple engineered polypeptides are inventive and not known in the literature. It has been surprisingly observed that conjugates o dendrimers and an engineered scaffold consisting of 2 to 100 repeated polypeptide chains have a much stronger growth inhibitory activity than conjugates of dcndrimcr and a single engineered polypeptide. Therefore in a preferred embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention are conjugates of dendrimers and 2 to 20 repeated polypeptide chains, in a particularly preferred embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention are conjugates of dendrimers and 2 to 10 repeated polypeptides. In another embodiment, subject-matter of the present invention are conjugates of dendrimers and multiple repeated polypeptides, wherein the polypeptides are connected by cleavable linker molecules, such as enzymatically cleavable amino acid sequences. Another aspect of the invention is related to the molecular binding inhibition of L-selectin, which can be determined as described by Dernedde et al. in PNAS, 2010, 107, 19679-84. Herein, polymeric, non-defined polyglycerolsulfate (Mn ~ 10 kDa) exhibits high capability of L-selectin binding inhibition with an IC50 of 8 nM, for example, using a polymer with 61 sulfate groups in average. With a defined sulfated dendrimer according to the invention, comparably bearing 48 sulfate groups, the values (~ 300 nM) are surprisingly higher indicating much weaker L-selectin binding inhibition. Therefore, subject-matterof the present invention is the provision of compounds according to formula E-[G-L-D(OS03"M+)n]m, which exhibit values for IC5o of L-selectin binding inhibition of > 30 nM, preferably > 100 nM, more preferably > 300 nM, most preferably > 500 nM, measured according to PNAS, 2010, 107, 19679-84.

CXCR4, Gap Definitions In chemistry, a conjugate refers to a compound formed by the joining of two or more chemical compounds. As used in the decription of the invention and in the claims, the term "conjugate" particularly has the meaning of a linked group of compounds having the elements of the formula E-[G-L-D(OS03"M ' )„]„,, in particular the effector molecule E, the connecting functional group G, linker L, dendrimer D, and the n sulfate groups (OSO M ), wherein M is a cationic inorganic or organic counter ion, wherein m is an integer from 1 to 20. The term "dendrimer" D as used herein generally denotes repetitively branched molecules, wherein a dendrimer is typically symmetric around the core, and often adopts a spherical three-dimensional morphology. Dendritic molecules are characterized by structural perfection. Dcndrimers arc monodisperse and usually highly symmetric, spherical compounds. The field of dendritic molecules can be roughly divided into low-molecular weight and high-molecular weight species. The first category includes dcndrimers and dendrons. and the latter includes dendroni/ed polymers, hyperbranched polymers, and the polymer brush. The properties of d end rimers are dominated by the functional groups on the molecular surface, however, there are examples of dendnmers with internal functionality. Dendritic encapsulation of functional molecules allows for the isolation of the active site, a structure that mimics that of active sites in biomatcrials. Also, it is possible to make dendrimers water soluble, unlike most polymers, by functionalizing their outer shell with charged species or other groups. Other controllable properties o dendrimers include toxicity, crystal linity, tecto- dendrimer formation, and chirality. D is a dendrimer or dendritic structure which is structurally defined with respect to its molecular weight, being a chemical structure with a single molecular weight. D(OS03"M+)o means that the dendrimer D is highly sulfated carrying a number n of sulfate groups (OSO3 M ). The sulfate groups are preferably derived from hydroxyl groups which are converted into sul ate groups (monocsters of sulfonic acid) by a sulfation process (see also examples). Accordingly, the dendrimers comprise a certain number of sulfate groups derived from OH groups. These OH groups arc preferably located on the surface or outer shell of the dendrimer and are part of the building blocks used to constitute the dendritic polyol structure. Dendrimer D consists of repeating units of monomers to built the dendritic structure comprising structures such as 1.2-substituted glycerol, 1 ,3 -substituted glycerol, pentaerythritol, lysine, tri s( h ydr ym eth y 1) aminomethanc. Also, alkyl-carboxylic acid- containing or alkyl-biscarboxylic acid structures, such as tris(propionic acid)aminomethane, 1 .1 *-bis(hydroxymethyl)-propionic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, maleic acid, glycolic acid, diglycolic acid, adipic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, propionic acid (2-aminoethyl)amide, as well as alkylamino structures, such as propyleneimine, ethyleneimine, and amino acid building blocks are part of the embodiment. Furthermore, monosaccharide structures, such as glucose, mannose, galactose are possible repeating units in dendrimers. Representative but not-limiting examples are depicted in Figures 1 to 7. Preferred dendrimers contain 1 ,2- substituted glycerol and/or 1 ,3-substituted glycerol. More preferred dendrimers contain 1 ,2- substitutcd glycerol and/or 1 ,3-substituted glycerol, optionally in combination with alkylcarboxlic acid units, allowing preferably connections selected from the functional groups ester, ether and amide. The synthesis of dendrimers is known to persons skilled in the art. The general structure of the dendrimer can be built up by a convergent synthetic pathway or a divergent synthetic pathway (Tomalia, WO2006/1 15547; Medina et al., Chem. Rev. 2009, 109, 3141 ; Crespo et al., Chem. Rev. 2005, 105, 1663). A preferred embodiment o the synthesis is a synthetic pathway, wherein a core unit (as described above) is modified such that a linker unit or functional group for further prolongation with a further linker unit is established. The dendrimer is then built up divergent by adding further shells starting from the core unit. Thus, the linker attached to the core unit is at the central position as a focal point. A combination with convergent synthetic pathways can be followed by adding a further dendrimer unit which has been previously built up by cither divergent or convergent pathways to the core unit or shells, thereby creating a further shell. Also, a convergent] y synthesized dendrimer with focal linker attachment can then be further modified by a divergent addition of further shells. The embodiment is supported by examples (1 - 11) of synthesis. The connection of monomers in the dendrimer is based on functional groups selected from ether, thioether, carboxylic ester, sulfonylester, sulfonamide, earboxylamide, amine, carbamate, thiocarbamate, urea, thiourea, hydrazone. imine, disulfide, phosphate, phosplionate, triazole. Hence, the dendrimer consists of repetitive subunits or shells based on different monomelic units, including but: not limited to the examples described herein (Figures 1 -7). Preferred dendrimers contain 1 ,2-substituted glycerol and/or 1,3 -substituted glycerol, optionally in combination with alkylcarboxlic acid units, allowing preferably connections selected from the functional groups ester, ether and amide. The term dendrimer is used through the embodiments, which is commonly understood as tree- like, branched structure. The term dendron usually describes a dendrimer with a single chemically addressable group called the focal point, but the terms are typically used interchangeably. The dendrimer D is composed in a fashion that a linker unit L is covalently attached to it. Preferred arc structures in which the linker unit L is covalently bound to a central position of the dendrimer. which is also called focal point. From this focal point, the dendrimer is grown to reach its dendritic structure. Representative but not-limiting examples arc depicted in Figures I to 7, wherein the "star" illustrates the connection of the linker L to the focal point of the dendrimer. A "linker" or "spacer" in accordance with the invention denotes a chemical structure which crosslinks two chemical molecules by forming one covalent bond to the first molecule and another covalent bond to the second molecule, A linker usually comprises two reactive groups, which can be identical (homobi unctional linker) or different (heterobi functional linker). In the context of the present invention, the sulfated dendrimer D is the first molecule and the linker forms a covalent bond with the focal point in the dendrimer. The therapeutic effector molecule E is the second molecule with a covalent bond formed by the structure G. The term "spacer" is often used similarly, more with the intention to describe that with this structure a certain distance ("space") between the two linked molecules is generated. In accordance with the invention, a "conjugate" is a molecule which consists two or more different types f molecules which are covalently linked to each other by a linker or spacer, thereby forming a conjugate. The term "terminal group" in the context of a chemical structure of dendrimer D describes the monomer units of the outer shell, which is the monomer to which no further monomer unit is attached. Most of the chemical properties of the molecule depend on types of terminal groups. The physical properties of the molecules, such as solubility and viscosity are also affected by the terminal groups. Accordingly, the terminal groups within the scope of the present invention provide sulfate groups derived from hydroxy! groups. These sulfate groups determine the biological properties of the inventive dendrimer conjugates with effector molecules, as outlined above. Counter ion M+ comprise organic and inorganic cations. Organic cations comprise lysine, meglumine, TR1S, glycine or other amines derived from amino acids. Inorganic cations comprise potassium, sodium, lithium, or mixtures thereof. Preferred is sodium leading to - S03"Na~ groups. The term "antibody" is well known in the art. As used herein, it denotes an immunoglobulin or any functional fragment thereof. It encompasses any polypeptide that has an antigen- binding site. It includes, but is not limited to, monoclonal, polyclonal, monospecific, polyspecific, non-specific, humanized, human, single-chain, chimeric, synthetic, recombinant, hybrid, mutated, grafted, and in vitro generated antibodies. The term "antibody" encompasses antibody fragments as well such as Fab, F(ab')2, Fv, scFv, Fd, dAb, and any other antibody fragments that retain antigen-binding function. Typically, such fragments would comprise an antigen-binding domain. The term "antibody" as defined above is preferably characterized by an binding constant of at least 10"' - 10"'° M in accordance with the invention. Further, an "antibody" is a protein that is produced as a reaction to an antigen stimulus and specifically recognizes and binds the antigen producing the stimulus. As used herein, the term "antibody mimetics" are organic compounds that, like antibodies, can specifically bind antigens, but that are not structurally related to antibodies. They are usually artificial peptides or proteins with a molar mass o about 3 to 20 kDa. Nucleic acids and small molecules are sometimes considered antibody mimetics as well, but not artificial antibodies, antibody fragments and fusion proteins composed from these. Some types have an antibody-like beta-sheet structure. Common advantages over antibodies are better solubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and comparatively low production costs. Antibody mimetics are being developed as therapeutic and diagnostic agents. The term "scaffolds" as used above falls under the term "antibody mimetics". As used herein, the term "effector" refers to an effector molecule that can act as a therapeutic or diagnostic effector molecule. A therapeutic effector molecule is usually a molecule that selectively binds to a protein and regulates its biological activity. In this manner, therapeutic effector molecules act as ligands that can increase or decrease enzyme activity, gene expression, or cell signalling. Effector molecules can also directly regulate the activity of some mRNA molecules (riboswitches). In the context of the present invention, polypeptides, including proteins and antibodies as described above, are considered to function as therapeutic effector molecules, especially in cellular signal transduction cascades. The term diagnostic effector molecule refers to molecules which upon the above mentioned biological interactions provide a detectable or recordable signal permitting quantification or monitoring the presence of this molecule in the target cell. This signal can be measured by analytical, chemical or physical techniques, such as ELISA, immunoassays, diagnostic imaging, including the detection of fluorescence, radioactive emission, or magnetic relaxation. In particular, effector molecules can be labeled with detectable molecules selected from fluorescent dyes, radioactive isotopes, paramagnetic metals. The term "transport protein" encompasses different terms including transmembrane pump, transporter protein, escort protein, acid transport protein, cation transport protein, or anion transport protein. Accordingly, it is a protein that moves other materials within an organism. Different kinds of transport proteins are known according to their function. These include carrier proteins involved in the movement of ions, small molecules, or macromolecules, such as another protein or a virus, across a biological membrane. Carrier proteins are membrane proteins which means they exist within a membrane across which they transport substances. They also called transmembrane solute earner proteins assisting in the passive or active transport, also called carrier-mediated transport.

Dithiotreithol (DTT; 80 mg) is added and the solution shaken for 1 h. Excess DTT is removed via SEC (Sephadex G50; phosphate buffer pH8 / 10 mM EDTA). To the resulting solution (approx. 8 mg in 4 mL, as measured by UV), a solution of 2.3 μηιοΐ (8 mol-eq.) of maleimido dendrimer (e.g. d02, d l 3, dl 9) in approx. 0.2 mL of water is added, followed by incubation for 24 h under gentle shaking.

All cells are seeded into medium at 1 x 10' cells /ml, cultured at 37°C with 5% C02, and split 1 :5 two times a week. The epithelial human cancer cell lines A549, MCF7, HaCaT, and HcpG2 are propagated in DMEM medium (PAN Biotech), with 10% fetal FCS, 2% glutamine, and pen i ci 11 i n/strept omyci n . Cells are seeded into medium at 1 x 105 cells /ml (37°C with 5% C02, split 1 :5 two times a week). H I 29 cells are cultured in McCoy's medium (PAN biotech), with 10% FCS), 2% glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells are seeded into medium at lx 10s cells/ml (37°C with 5% C02, split 1 :10 two times a week). For cellular microscopy, cells are seeded at 2 x 105 cells /ml in a 24-well culture plate on glass coverslips (Sigma), cultured for 24 hours at 37°C, then cultured with medium containing 10"6 M of ICC-dOL ICC-dl2, ICC-d.18 or respective derivatives with 48 sulfate groups, or dendrimcr conjugates with proteins (examples 12 and 13) or 10"6 M glyccrol-lCC (control) for up to 24 hours at 37°C. Afterwards, cells are fixed with cold acetone, rinsed and covered with 4,6-diamidino-2- phenyl indole (DAPI, Abeam) for nuclear counterstain. Image acquisition is performed using a Leica DMRB microscope (Leica). Images are taken with a digital camera (Spot 32, Diagnostic Instruments) with the same exposure time for all pictures. Fig. 8 A shows an example of intracellular distribution in the cyto.solic areas (ICC-dOl , example 8). To quantify the cellular uptake mediated by the sulfated dendrimers, ICC-dOl (example 8) Is used to incubate l O7 SKBR3 tumor cells with 10"6 M ICC-dOl for 24 h. This amount and time is sufficient to measure the supernatant after pooling and cell lysis with DMSO. Figure 8 B shows the resulting absorption spectrum (ICC ext.coeff (559 nm) 150,000 M"1 cm"1) giving 10"17 moles per cell, which corresponds to approx. 5 Mio molecules per cell. For FACS studies, 2 x 1 ()5 cells/ml cells arc cultured in 24-well plates with normal culture medium or medium containing different concentrations of test substances for 3 or 24 hours. Thereafter, cells are washed with PBS and detached with 200 μΐ/well accutase (PAA) and washed two times with PBS. Cells are fixed with 500 μΐ 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4°C, stopped with 2 ml PBS and centrifuged with 250 x g, for 10 min at 4°C.

Table 5: Values of uptake measured by FACS, relative to ICC-dOl (range from different cell lines: HT29, HepG2, QGP- 1 , A431 , MCF-7, A2780) after incubation for 24 h. All conjugates were additionally conjugated with ICC NHS ester, and values were corrected by fluorescence due to differing dye-to-protein ratio or dendrimer loading. Example 16 Activity of protcin-dendrimcr conjugates in tumor cells For cytotoxicty measurements, 2 x 10s cells were incubated with 1 ml culture medium containing increasing concentrations of test substances. After 72 hs treatment, cell number. viability and cell diameter as parameter of apoptotic processes were analyzed in a cell counter and analyzer system (CASY®, Scharfe Systems). In addition, drag cytotoxicity was assessed in vitro using the MTT assay (cellular reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2~yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide) as a test for metabolic activity of the cells. 1 x 10 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates in 100 μΐ culture medium containing increasing concentration of the test substance. 10 μΙ MTT (5 mg/ml inPBS, obtained from Sigma) was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 4 hrs, 24 hrs, 48 hrs or up to 72 h. The resulting foraiazan product was dissolved with acid isopropanol and the absorbance at a wavelength of 570 nm (Ex 570) was read on a Microplatc Spectrophotometer (Anthos htll, Microsystems). In a couple of experiments, medium with test substances was removed after 48 hs, cells were counted and identical cell numbers with new medium without test substances were seeded in new plates. MTT assay was performed after further incubation for 72 hours. As examples, table 6 shows that conjugates of ribosomal-inhibiting toxins exhibit an increased cytotoxicity due to cellular uptake and intracellular activity.

Example 18 Selectivity of intracellular uptake of dendrimer conjugates with proteins: effects of inhibitors on uptake of L- asparaginase conjugate Asp-d02 (example 12a). Studies on cellular uptake measured by FACS were conducted as described in example 13. Compound Asp-dl3 is incubated at a concentration of 10"7 M in QGP- 1 tumor cells for 3 h and 6 h. Incubation is done in the presence of one of the following two substrates: (1) 0.1 mM genistein, an inhibitor for endocytotic uptake (Rejman et al.. Mol. Ther. 2005, 1 2, 468-474) or (2) 50 niM rifamycin, an inhibitor of uptake via organic anion transporter proteins (OATP; Bi et al, Drug Metab Dispos. 2012. 40, 1085-92). The results demonstrate that FACS signals relative to Asp-dl3 without inhibitor (defined as 100%) decrease in the presence of rifamycin to 37 - 40 %, whereas no significant decrease can be measured in the presence of genistein (80 - 85 %), see table 7 for data. For L-asparaginase coupled to a polyglycerolsulfate (mean molecular weight of 12000 Da; used according to W O201 1 , 0953 1 1 ) endocytosis could be identified due to inhibition by genistein.
