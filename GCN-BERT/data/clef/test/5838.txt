Synthesis Example 2
Synthesis of Compound 22
1.82 g (2.37 mmol, yield=67%) of Compound 22 was synthesized in the same manner as in Synthesis Example 1, except that 2.00 g (7.08 mmol) of 10-phenylanthracene-9-carbaldehyde was used instead of 1.64 g (7.08 mmol) of 4-phenyl-1-naphthaldehyde, and Intermediate 4-hydroxy-3-(10-phenylanthracen-9-yl)pent-3-en-2-one was used instead of Intermediate 4-hydroxy-3-(4-phenylnaphthalen-1-yl)pent-3-en-2-one.
