Furthermore, it relates to manufacturing vaccines for protecting against influenza A viruses. BACKGROUND ART The most efficient protection against influenza infection is vaccination against circulating strains and it is important to produce influenza viruses for vaccine production as quickly as possible. Wild-type influenza viruses often grow to low titres in eggs and cell culture. In order to obtain a better-growing virus strain for vaccine production it is currently common practice to reassort the circulating vaccine strain with a faster-growing high-yield donor strain. This can be achieved by co-infecting a culture host with the circulating influenza strain (the vaccine strain) and the high-yield donor strain and selecting for reassortant viruses which contain the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) segments from the vaccine strain and the other viral segments (i.e. those encoding PB1, PB2, PA, NP, M1, M2, NS1 and NS2) from the donor strain. Another approach is to reassort the influenza viruses by reverse genetics (see, for example references 1 and 2). Reference 3 reports that a reassortant influenza virus containing a PB1 gene segment from A/Texas/1/77, the HA and NA segments from A/New Caledonia/20/99, a modified PA segment derived from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 and the remaining viral segments from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 shows increased growth in cells. There are currently only a limited number of donor strains for reassorting influenza viruses for vaccine manufacture, and the strain most commonly used is the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (A/PR/8/34) strain. However, reassortant influenza viruses comprising A/PR/8/34 backbone segments do not always grow sufficiently well to ensure efficient vaccine manufacture. Thus, there is a need in the art to provide further and improved donor strains for influenza virus reassortment. SUMMARY OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The inventors have now surprisingly discovered that influenza viruses which comprise backbone segments from two or more influenza donor strains can grow faster in a culture host (particularly in cell culture) compared with reassortant influenza A viruses which contain all backbone segments from the same donor strain. In particular, the inventors have found that influenza viruses which comprise backbone segments derived from two different high-yield donor strains can produce higher yield reassortants with target vaccine-relevant HA/NA genes than reassortants made with either of the two original donor strains alone. Reassortant influenza A viruses with backbone segments from two or more influenza donor strains may comprise the HA segment and the PB1 segment from different influenza A strains. In these reassortant influenza viruses the PB1 segment is preferably from donor viruses with the same influenza virus HA subtype as the vaccine strain. For example, the PB1 segment and the HA segment may both be from influenza viruses with a H1 subtype. The reassortant influenza A viruses may also comprise the HA segment and the PB1 segment from different influenza A strains with different influenza virus HA subtypes, wherein the PB1 segment is not from an influenza virus with a H3 HA subtype and/or wherein the HA segment is not from an influenza virus with a H1 or H5 HA subtype. For example, the PB1 segment may be from a H1 virus and/or the HA segment may be from a H3 influenza virus. The invention also provides reassortant influenza A viruses with backbone segments from two or more influenza donor strains in which the PB1 segment is from the A/California/07/09 influenza strain. This segment may have at least 95% identity or 100% identity with the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 22. The reassortant influenza A virus may have the H1 HA subtype. It will be understood that a reassortant influenza virus according to this aspect of the invention will not comprise the HA and/or NA segments from A/California/07/09. Where the reassortant influenza A virus comprises backbone segments from two or three donor strains, each donor strain may provide more than one of the backbone segments of the reassortant influenza A virus, but one or two of the donor strains can also provide only a single backbone segment. Where the reassortant influenza A virus comprises backbone segments from two, three, four or five donor strains, one or two of the donor strains may provide more than one of the backbone segments of the reassortant influenza A virus. In general the reassortant influenza A virus cannot comprise more than six backbone segments. Accordingly, for example, if one of the donor strains provides five of the viral segments, the reassortant influenza A virus can only comprise backbone segments from a total of two different donor strains. Where a reassortant influenza A virus comprises the PB1 segment from A/Texas/1/77, it preferably does not comprise the PA, NP or M segment from A/Puerto Rico/8/34. Where a reassortant influenza A virus comprises the PA, NP or M segment from A/Puerto Rico/8/34, it preferably does not comprise the PB1 segment from A/Texas/1/77. In some embodiments, the invention does not encompass reassortant influenza A viruses which have the PB1 segment from A/Texas/1/77 and the PA, NP and M segments from A/Puerto Rico/8/34. The PB1 segment from A/Texas/1/77 may have the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 27 and the PA, NP or M segments from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 may have the sequence of SEQ ID NOs 28, 29 or 30, respectively. Influenza A virus strains of the invention can grow to higher viral titres in MDCK cells and/or in eggs in the same time and under the same growth conditions compared with reassortant influenza strains that comprise all backbone segments from the same influenza donor strain. The invention also provides a reassortant influenza A virus comprising at least one backbone viral segment from a donor strain, wherein the donor strain is the A/California/07/09 influenza strain. When the at least one backbone viral segment is the PA segment it may have a sequence having at least 95% or at least 99% identity with the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 15. When the at least one backbone viral segment is the PB1 segment, it may have a sequence having at least 95% or at least 99% identity with the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 16. When the at least one backbone viral segment is the PB2 segment, it may have a sequence having at least 95% or at least 99% identity with the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 17. When the at least one backbone viral segment is the NP segment it may have a sequence having at least 95% or at least 99% identity with the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 18. When the at least one backbone viral segment is the M segment it may have a sequence having at least 95% or at least 99% identity with the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 19. When the at least one backbone viral segment is the NS segment it may have a sequence having at least 95% or at least 99% identity with the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20. At least one backbone segment may be derived from the A/California/07/09 influenza strain, as discussed in the previous paragraph. Preferred reassortant influenza A viruses comprise the PB1 segment from the A/California/07/09 influenza strain. The inventors have shown that reassortant influenza A viruses comprising this backbone segment grow well in culture hosts. The reassortant influenza A viruses may comprise all other backbone segments from an influenza virus which is not A/California/07/09. The reassortant influenza A viruses may comprise the PB1 segment from A/California/07/09 and all other backbone segments from the influenza strain PR8-X. The segments of PR8-X have the sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1 (PA), SEQ ID NO: 2 (PB1), SEQ ID NO: 3 (PB2), SEQ ID NO: 4 (NP), SEQ ID NO: 5 (M), SEQ ID NO: 6 (NS), SEQ ID NO: 7 (HA) or SEQ ID NO: 8 (NA). Thus, the influenza viruses of the invention may comprise one or more genome segments selected from: a PA segment having at least 95% or 99% identity to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, a PB2 segment having at least 95% or 99% identity to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, a M segment having at least 95% or 99% identity to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, a NP segment having at least 95% or 99% identity to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, and/or a NS segment having at least 95% or 99% identity to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6. The reassortant influenza A viruses may also comprise one or more viral segments which have the sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 1, and/or 3-6. In preferred embodiments, the reassortant influenza strain comprises all of the genome segments mentioned in this paragraph. This embodiment is preferred because the inventors have found that such reassortant influenza A viruses grow particularly well in cell culture and in embryonated hens eggs. In general a reassortant influenza virus will contain only one of each backbone segment. For example, when the influenza virus comprises the PB1 segment from A/California/07/09 it will not at the same time comprise the PB1 segment from another influenza A donor strain. The backbone viral segments may be optimized for culture in the specific culture host. For example, where the reassortant influenza viruses are cultured in mammalian cells, it is advantageous to adapt at least one of the viral segments for optimal growth in the culture host. For example, where the expression host is a canine cell, such as a MDCK cell line, the viral segments may have a sequence which optimises viral growth in the cell. Thus, the reassortant influenza viruses of the invention may comprise a PB2 genome segment which has lysine in the position corresponding to amino acid 389 of SEQ ID NO: 3 when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 3 using a painvise alignment algorithm, and/or asparagine in the position corresponding to amino acid 559 of SEQ ID NO: 3 when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 3 using a pairwise alignment algorithm. Also provided are reassortant influenza viruses in accordance with the invention in which the PA genome segment has lysine in the position corresponding to amino acid 327 of SEQ ID NO: 1 when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 1 using a pairwise alignment algorithm, and/or aspartic acid in the position corresponding to amino acid 444 of SEQ ID NO: 1 when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 1, using a pairwise alignment algorithm, and/or aspartic acid in the position corresponding to amino acid 675 of SEQ ID NO: 1 when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 1, using a pairwise alignment algorithm. The reassortant influenza strains of the invention may also have a NP genome segment with threonine in the position corresponding to amino acid 27 of SEQ ID NO: 4 when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 4 using a pairwise alignment algorithm, and/or asparagine in the position corresponding to amino acid 375 of SEQ ID NO: 4 when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 4, using a pairwise alignment algorithm. Variant influenza strains may also comprise two or more of these mutations. It is preferred that the variant influenza virus contains a variant PB2 segment with both of the amino acids changes identified above, and/or a PA which contains all three of the amino acid changes identified above, and/or a NP segment which contains both of the amino acid changes identified above. The influenza A virus may be a H1 strain. Alternatively, or in addition, the reassortants influenza viruses may comprise a PB1 segment which has isoleucine in the position corresponding to amino acid 200 of SEQ ID NO: 2 when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 2 using a pairwise alignment algorithm, and/or asparagine in the position corresponding to amino acid 338 of SEQ ID NO: 2 when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 2 using a pairwise alignment algorithm, and/or isoleucine in the position corresponding to amino acid 529 of SEQ ID NO: 2 when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 2 using a pairwise alignment algorithm, and/or isoleucine in the position corresponding to amino acid 591 of SEQ ID NO: 2 when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 2 using a pairwise alignment algorithm, and/or histidine in the position corresponding to amino acid 687 of SEQ ID NO: 2 when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 2 using a pairwise alignment algorithm, and/or lysine in the position corresponding to amino acid 754 of SEQ ID NO: 2 when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 2 using a pairwise alignment algorithm. The preferred pairwise alignment algorithm is the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm [4], using default parameters (e.g. with Gap opening penalty=10.0, and with Gap extension penalty=0.5, using the EBLOSUM62 scoring matrix). This algorithm is conveniently implemented in the needle tool in the EMBOSS package [5]. The invention provides a method of preparing the reassortant influenza A viruses of the invention. These methods comprise steps of (i) introducing into a culture host one or more expression construct(s) which encode(s) the viral segments required to produce an influenza A virus wherein the backbone viral segments are from two or more influenza strains; and (ii) culturing the culture host in order to produce reassortant virus and optionally (iii) purifying the virus obtained in step (ii). In these methods, the HA and the PB1 segment may be from different influenza strains which have the same influenza HA subtype or the HA and PB1 segments may be from different influenza strains with different HA subtypes provided that the PB1 segment is not from an influenza virus with a H3 HA subtype and/or the HA segment is not from an influenza virus with a H1 or H5 HA subtype. The PB1 backbone viral segment may be from A/California/07/09. The one or more expression constructs may further encode one or more of the PB2, PA, NP, M, or NS segments from PR8-X or segments having at least 90% or 100% identity to SEQ ID NOs: 9, and/or 11 to 14. The expression construct(s) may not encode the HA and/or NA segments from A/California/07/09 when the PB1 segment is from A/California/07/09. The at least one expression construct may comprise a sequence having at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99% or 100% identity with the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 22. In some embodiments, the at least one expression construct does not encode the PB1 segment from the A/Texas/1/77 influenza strain. The methods may further comprise steps of: (iv) infecting a culture host with the virus obtained in step (ii) or step (iii); (v) culturing the culture host from step (iv) to produce further virus; and optionally (vi) purifying the virus obtained in step (v). The invention also provides a method for producing influenza viruses comprising steps of (a) infecting a culture host with a reassortant virus of the invention; (b) culturing the host from step (a) to produce the virus; and optionally (c) purifying the virus obtained in step (b). The invention also provides a method of preparing a vaccine, comprising steps of (d) preparing a virus by the methods of any one of the embodiments described above and (e) preparing vaccine from the virus. The invention provides an expression system comprising one or more expression construct(s) comprising the vRNA encoding segments of an influenza A virus wherein the expression construct(s) encode(s) the HA and PB1 segments from two different influenza strains with the same influenza HA subtype or which encodes the HA and PB1 segments from two different influenza strains with different influenza virus HA subtypes, wherein the PB1 segment is not from an influenza virus with a H3 HA subtype and/or the HA segment is not from an influenza virus with a H1 or H5 HA subtype. The invention also provides an expression system comprising one or more expression construct(s) comprising the vRNA encoding segments of an influenza A virus wherein the expression construct(s) encode(s) the PB1 segment of A/California/07/09. The expression construct(s) may further comprise the vRNAs which encode one or more of the PB2, NP, NS, M and/or PA segments from PR8-X. Thus, the expression construct(s) may comprise one or more nucleotide sequences having at least 90% identity, at least 95% identity, at least 99% identity or 100% identity with the sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 9 and/or 11-14. It is preferred that the expression construct(s) encode(s) all of the PB2, NP, NS, M and PA segments from PR8-X. The invention also provides a host cell comprising the expression systems of the invention. These host cells can express an influenza A virus from the expression construct(s) in the expression system. Expression constructs which can be used in the expression systems of the invention are also provided. For example, the invention provides an expression construct which encodes the backbone segments of the reassortant influenza strains according to the invention on the same construct. Donor Strains Influenza donor strains are strains which typically provide the backbone segments in a reassortant influenza virus, even though they may sometimes also provide the NA segment of the virus. Usually, however, both the HA and the NA segment in a reassortant influenza virus will be from the vaccine strain which is the influenza strain that provides the HA segment. The inventors have surprisingly discovered that reassortant influenza A viruses which comprise the HA segment and the PB1 segment from different influenza A strains with the same HA subtype can grow much faster in culture hosts compared with reassortant influenza viruses which comprise the HA and PB1 segments from viruses with different HA subtypes. These reassortant influenza viruses preferably have backbone segments from at least two donor strains. The PB1 segments of influenza viruses with the same HA subtype will usually have a higher level of identity than the PB1 segments of influenza viruses with different HA subtypes. For example, a Blast search using the PB1 segment of the H1 strain A/California/07/09 showed that only influenza strains with the H1 HA subtype had a high identity in the PB1 segment. Likewise, a Blast search using the PB1 segment of the H3 strain A/Wisconsin/67/2005 showed that only influenza viruses with the H3 HA subtype had a high level of identity to the PB1 segment of this virus. The inventors have further discovered that reassortant influenza A viruses which have backbone segments from at least two donor strains and comprise the PB1 segment from A/California/07/09 grow particularly well in culture hosts. These reassortant influenza viruses preferably have backbone segments from at least two different donor strains. The reassortant influenza viruses may comprise the PB1 segment from A/California/07/09 and the HA segment of an influenza virus with the H1 subtype. Influenza strains which contain one, two, three, four five, six or seven of the segments of the A/California/07/09 strain can also be used as donor strains. The invention can be practised with donor strains having a viral segment that has at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95% or at least about 99% identity to a sequence of SEQ ID NOs 9-14 or 21-26. For example, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, it is possible to have the same polypeptide encoded by several nucleic acids with different sequences. Thus, the invention may be practised with viral segments that encode the same polypeptides as the sequences of SEQ ID NOs 1-8 or 15-20. For example, the nucleic acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 31 and 32 have only 73% identity even though they encode the same viral protein. The invention may also be practised with viral segments that encode polypeptides that have at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95% or at least 99% identity to the polypeptide sequences encoded by SEQ ID NOs 9-22. Variations in the DNA and the amino acid sequence may also stem from spontaneous mutations which can occur during passaging of the viruses. Such variant influenza strains can also be used in the invention. Reassortant Viruses The invention provides reassortant influenza viruses which comprise backbone segments from two or more influenza donor strains. These reassortant influenza viruses may comprise the HA segment and the PB1 segment from different influenza A strains provided that the HA and the PB1 segments are from influenza viruses with the same influenza virus HA subtype. They may also comprise the HA segment and the PB1 segment from different influenza A strains with different influenza virus HA subtypes, provided that the PB1 segment is not from an influenza virus with a H3 HA subtype and/or the HA segment is not from an influenza virus with a H1 or H5 HA subtype. Further provided are reassortant influenza viruses with backbone segments from two or more different donor strains which comprise the PB1 segment from A/California/07/09. The PB1 and PB2 segments may be from the same donor strain. Influenza viruses are segmented negative strand RNA viruses. Influenza A and B viruses have eight segments (NP, M, NS, PA, PB1, HA and NA) whereas influenza C virus has seven. The reassortant viruses of the invention contain the backbone segments from two or more donor strains, or at least one (i.e. one, two, three, four, five or six) backbone viral segment from A/California/07/09. The backbone viral segments are those which do not encode HA or NA. Thus, backbone segments will typically encode the PB1, PB2, PA, NP, M1, M2, NS1 and NS2 polypeptides of the influenza virus. The viruses may also contain an NS segment that does not encode a functional NS protein as described, for example, in reference 6. The reassortant viruses will not typically contain the segments encoding HA and NA from the donor strains even though reassortant viruses which comprise either the HA or the NA but not both from the donor strains of the invention are also envisioned. When the reassortant viruses are reassortants comprising the backbone segments from a single donor strain, the reassortant viruses will generally include segments from the donor strain and the vaccine strain in a ratio of 1:7, 2:6, 3:5, 4:4, 5:3, 6:2 or 7:1. Having a majority of segments from the donor strain, in particular a ratio of 6:2, is typical. When the reassortant viruses comprise backbone segments from two donor strains, the reassortant virus will generally include segments from the first donor strain, the second donor strain and the vaccine strain in a ratio of 1:1:6, 1:2:5, 1:3:4, 1:4:3, 1:5:2, 1:6:1, 2:1:5, 2:2:4, 2:3:3, 2:4:2, 2:5:1, 3:1:2, 3:2:1, 4:1:3, 4:2:2, 4:3:1, 5:1:2, 5:2:1 or 6:1:1. Preferably, the reassortant viruses do not contain the HA segment of the donor strain as this encodes the main vaccine antigens of the influenza virus and should therefore come from the vaccine strain. The reassortant viruses of the invention therefore preferably have at least the HA segment and typically the HA and NA segments from the vaccine strain. The invention also encompasses reassortants which comprise viral segments from more than one vaccine strain provided that the reassortant comprises a backbone according to the present invention. For example, the reassortant influenza viruses may comprise the HA segment from one donor strain and the NA segment from a different donor strain. The reassortant viruses of the invention can grow to higher viral titres than the wild-type vaccine strain from which some of the viral segment(s) of the reassortant virus are derived in the same time (for example 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours or 72 hours) and under the same growth conditions. The viral titre can be determined by standard methods known to those of skill in the art. The reassortant viruses of the invention can achieve a viral titre which is at least 10% higher, at least 20% higher, at least 50% higher, at least 100% higher, at least 200% higher, at least 500% higher, or at least 1000% higher than the viral titre of the wild type vaccine strain in the same time frame and under the same conditions. The invention is suitable for reassorting pandemic as well as inter-pandemic (seasonal) influenza vaccine strains. The reassortant influenza strains may contain the influenza A virus HA subtypes H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H11, H12, H13, H14, H15 or H16. They may contain the influenza A virus NA subtypes N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6, N7, N8 or N9. Where the vaccine strain used in the reassortant influenza viruses of the invention is a seasonal influenza strain, the vaccine strain may have a H1 or H3 subtype. In one aspect of the invention the vaccine strain is a H1N1 or H3N2 strain. The reassortants influenza strains may also contain the HA segment of an influenza B strain. The vaccine strains for use in the invention may also be pandemic strains or potentially pandemic strains. The characteristics of an influenza strain that give it the potential to cause a pandemic outbreak are: (a) it contains a new hemagglutinin compared to the hemagglutinins in currently-circulating human strains, i.e. one that has not been evident in the human population for over a decade (e.g. H2), or has not previously been seen at all in the human population (e.g. H5, H6 or H9, that have generally been found only in bird populations), such that the human population will be immunologically naïve to the strain's hemagglutinin; (b) it is capable of being transmitted horizontally in the human population; and (c) it is pathogenic to humans. A vaccine strain with a H5 hemagglutinin type is preferred where the reassortant virus is used in vaccines for immunizing against pandemic influenza, such as a H5N1 strain. Other possible strains include H5N3, H9N2, H2N2, H7N1 and H7N7, and any other emerging potentially pandemic strains. The invention is particularly suitable for producing reassortant viruses for use in a vaccine for protecting against potential pandemic virus strains that can or have spread from a non-human animal population to humans, for example a swine-origin H1N1 influenza strain. The reassortant influenza strain of the invention may comprise the HA segment and/or the NA segment from an A/California/4/09 strain. Strains which can be used as vaccine strains include strains which are resistant to antiviral therapy (e.g. resistant to oseltamivir [7] and/or zanamivir), including resistant pandemic strains [8]. Reassortant viruses which contain an NS segment that does not encode a functional NS protein are also within the scope of the present invention. NS1 knockout mutants are described in reference 6. These NS1-mutant virus strains are particularly suitable for preparing live attenuated influenza vaccines. The ‘second influenza strain’ used in the methods of the invention is different to the donor strain which is used. Reverse Genetics The invention is particularly suitable for producing the reassortant influenza virus strains of the invention through reverse genetics techniques. In these techniques, the viruses are produced in culture hosts using an expression system. In one aspect, the expression system may encode the HA and PB1 segment from different influenza strains with the same HA subtype. It may also encode the HA and PB1 segments from different influenza strains with different HA subtypes provided that the PB1 segment is not from an influenza virus with a H3 HA subtype and/or the HA segment is not from an influenza virus with a H1 or H5 HA subtype. The expression system may encode the PB1 segment from A/California/07/09. In these embodiments, the system may encode at least one of the segments NP, M, NS, PA, and/or PB2 from another influenza donor strain, for example PR8-X. Reverse genetics for influenza A and B viruses can be practised with 12 plasmids to express the four proteins required to initiate replication and transcription (PB1, PB2, PA and nucleoprotein) and all eight viral genome segments. To reduce the number of constructs, however, a plurality of RNA polymerase I transcription cassettes (for viral RNA synthesis) can be included on a single plasmid (e.g. sequences encoding 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or all 8 influenza vRNA segments), and a plurality of protein-coding regions with RNA polymerase II promoters on another plasmid (e.g. sequences encoding 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 influenza mRNA transcripts) [9]. It is also possible to include one or more influenza vRNA segments under control of a pol I promoter and one or more influenza protein coding regions under control of another promoter, in particular a pol II promoter, on the same plasmid. This is preferably done by using bi-directional plasmids. Preferred aspects of the reference 9 method involve: (a) PB1, PB2 and PA mRNA-encoding regions on a single expression construct; and (b) all 8 vRNA encoding segments on a single expression construct. Including the neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA) segments on one expression construct and the six other viral segments on another expression construct is particularly preferred as newly emerging influenza virus strains usually have mutations in the NA and/or HA segments. Therefore, the advantage of having the HA and/or NA segments on a separate expression construct is that only the vector comprising the HA and NA sequence needs to be replaced. Thus, in one aspect of the invention the NA and/or HA segments of the vaccine strain may be included on one expression construct and the vRNA encoding segments from the donor strain(s) of the invention, excluding the HA and/or NA segment(s), are included on a different expression construct. The invention thus provides an expression construct comprising one, two, three, four, five or six vRNA encoding backbone viral segments of a donor strain of the invention. The expression construct may not comprise HA and/or NA viral segments that produce a functional HA and/or NA protein. Known reverse genetics systems involve expressing DNA molecules which encode desired viral RNA (vRNA) molecules from pol I promoters, bacterial RNA polymerase promoters, bacteriophage polymerase promoters, etc. As influenza viruses require the presence of viral polymerase to initiate the life cycle, systems may also provide these proteins e.g. the system further comprises DNA molecules that encode viral polymerase proteins such that expression of both types of DNA leads to assembly of a complete infectious virus. It is also possible to supply the viral polymerase as a protein. Where reverse genetics is used for the expression of influenza vRNA, it will be evident to the person skilled in the art that precise spacing of the sequence elements with reference to each other is important for the polymerase to initiate replication. It is therefore important that the DNA molecule encoding the viral RNA is positioned correctly between the pol I promoter and the termination sequence, but this positioning is well within the capabilities of those who work with reverse genetics systems. In order to produce a recombinant virus, a cell must express all segments of the viral genome which are necessary to assemble a virion. DNA cloned into the expression constructs of the present invention preferably provides all of the viral RNA and proteins, but it is also possible to use a helper virus to provide some of the RNA and proteins, although systems which do not use a helper virus are preferred. As the influenza virus is a segmented virus, the viral genome will usually be expressed using more than one expression construct in the methods of the invention. It is also envisioned, however, to combine one or more segments or even all segments of the viral genome on a single expression construct. In some embodiments an expression construct will also be included which leads to expression of an accessory protein in the host cell. For instance, it can be advantageous to express a non-viral serine protease (e.g. trypsin) as part of a reverse genetics system. Expression Constructs Expression constructs used in the expression systems of the invention may be uni-directional or bi-directional expression constructs. Where more than one transgene is used in the methods (whether on the same or different expression constructs) it is possible to use uni-directional and/or bi-directional expression. As influenza viruses require a protein for infectivity, it is generally preferred to use bi-directional expression constructs as this reduces the total number of expression constructs required by the host cell. Thus, the method of the invention may utilise at least one bi-directional expression construct wherein a gene or cDNA is located between an upstream pol II promoter and a downstream non-endogenous pol I promoter. Transcription of the gene or cDNA from the pol II promoter produces capped positive-sense viral mRNA which can be translated into a protein, while transcription from the non-endogenous pol I promoter produces negative-sense vRNA. The bi-directional expression construct may be a bi-directional expression vector. Bi-directional expression constructs contain at least two promoters which drive expression in different directions (i.e. both 5′ to 3′ and 3′ to 5′) from the same construct. The two promoters can be operably linked to different strands of the same double stranded DNA. Preferably, one of the promoters is a pol I promoter and at least one of the other promoters is a pol II promoter. This is useful as the pol I promoter can be used to express uncapped vRNAs while the pol II promoter can be used to transcribe mRNAs which can subsequently be translated into proteins, thus allowing simultaneous expression of RNA and protein from the same construct. Where more than one expression construct is used within an expression system, the promoters may be a mixture of endogenous and non-endogenous promoters. The pol I and pol II promoters used in the expression constructs may be endogenous to an organism from the same taxonomic order from which the host cell is derived. Alternatively, the promoters can be derived from an organism in a different taxonomic order than the host cell. The term “order” refers to conventional taxonomic ranking, and examples of orders are primates, rodentia, carnivora, marsupialia, cetacean, etc. Humans and chimpanzees are in the same taxonomic order (primates), but humans and dogs are in different orders (primates vs. carnivora). For example, the human pol I promoter can be used to express viral segments in canine cells (e.g. MDCK cells) [10]. The expression construct will typically include an RNA transcription termination sequence. The termination sequence may be an endogenous termination sequence or a termination sequence which is not endogenous to the host cell. Suitable termination sequences will be evident to those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, RNA polymerase I transcription termination sequence, RNA polymerase II transcription termination sequence, and ribozymes. Furthermore, the expression constructs may contain one or more polyadenylation signals for mRNAs, particularly at the end of a gene whose expression is controlled by a pol II promoter. An expression system may contain at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, at least seven, at least eight, at least nine, at least ten, at least eleven or at least twelve expression constructs. An expression construct may be a vector, such as a plasmid or other episomal construct. Such vectors will typically comprise at least one bacterial and/or eukaryotic origin of replication. Furthermore, the vector may comprise a selectable marker which allows for selection in prokaryotic and/or eukaryotic cells. Examples of such selectable markers are genes conferring resistance to antibiotics, such as ampicillin or kanamycin. The vector may further comprise one or more multiple cloning sites to facilitate cloning of a DNA sequence. As an alternative, an expression construct may be a linear expression construct. Such linear expression constructs will typically not contain any amplification and/or selection sequences. However, linear constructs comprising such amplification and/or selection sequences are also within the scope of the present invention. Reference 11 describes a linear expression construct which describes individual linear expression constructs for each viral segment. It is also possible to include more than one, for example two, three four, five or six viral segments on the same linear expression construct. Such a system has been described, for example, in reference 12. Expression constructs can be generated using methods known in the art. Such methods were described, for example, in reference 13. Where the expression construct is a linear expression construct, it is possible to linearise it before introduction into the host cell utilising a single restriction enzyme site. Alternatively, it is possible to excise the expression construct from a vector using at least two restriction enzyme sites. Furthermore, it is also possible to obtain a linear expression construct by amplifying it using a nucleic acid amplification technique (e.g. by PCR). The expression constructs used in the systems of the invention may be non-bacterial expression constructs. This means that the construct can drive expression in a eukaryotic cell of viral RNA segments encoded therein, but it does not include components which would be required for propagation of the construct in bacteria. Thus the construct will not include a bacterial origin of replication (ori), and usually will not include a bacterial selection marker (e.g. an antibiotic resistance marker). Such expression constructs are described in reference 14 which is incorporated by reference. The expression constructs may be prepared by chemical synthesis. The expression constructs may either be prepared entirely by chemical synthesis or in part. Suitable methods for preparing expression constructs by chemical synthesis are described, for example, in reference 14 which is incorporated by reference. The expression constructs of the invention can be introduced into host cells using any technique known to those of skill in the art. For example, expression constructs of the invention can be introduced into host cells by employing electroporation, DEAE-dextran, calcium phosphate precipitation, liposomes, microinjection, or microparticle-bombardment. Cells The culture host for use in the present invention can be any eukaryotic cell that can produce the virus of interest. The invention will typically use a cell line although, for example, primary cells may be used as an alternative. The cell will typically be mammalian or avian. Suitable mammalian cells include, but are not limited to, hamster, cattle, primate (including humans and monkeys) and dog cells. Various cell types may be used, such as kidney cells, fibroblasts, retinal cells, lung cells, etc. Examples of suitable hamster cells are the cell lines having the names BHK21 or HKCC. Suitable monkey cells are e.g. African green monkey cells, such as kidney cells as in the Vero cell line [15-17]. Suitable dog cells are e.g. kidney cells, as in the CLDK and MDCK cell lines. Further suitable cells include, but are not limited to: CHO; 293T; BHK; MRC 5; PER.C6 [18]; FRhL2; WI-38; etc. Suitable cells are widely available e.g. from the American Type Cell Culture (ATCC) collection [19], from the Coriell Cell Repositories [20], or from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC). For example, the ATCC supplies various different Vero cells under catalogue numbers CCL 81, CCL 81.2, CRL 1586 and CRL-1587, and it supplies MDCK cells under catalogue number CCL 34. PER.C6 is available from the ECACC under deposit number 96022940. Preferred cells for use in the invention are MDCK cells [21-23], derived from Madin Darby canine kidney. The original MDCK cells are available from the ATCC as CCL 34. It is preferred that derivatives of MDCK cells are used. Such derivatives were described, for instance, in reference 21 which discloses MDCK cells that were adapted for growth in suspension culture (‘MDCK 33016’ or ‘33016-PF’, deposited as DSM ACC 2219; see also ref. 21). Furthermore, reference 24 discloses MDCK-derived cells that grow in suspension in serum free culture (‘B-702’, deposited as FERM BP-7449). In some embodiments, the MDCK cell line used may be tumorigenic. It is also envisioned to use non-tumorigenic MDCK cells. For example, reference 25 discloses non tumorigenic MDCK cells, including ‘MDCK-S’ (ATCC PTA-6500), ‘MDCK-SF101’ (ATCC PTA-6501), ‘MDCK-SF102’ (ATCC PTA-6502) and ‘MDCK-SF103’ (ATCC PTA-6503). Reference 26 discloses MDCK cells with high susceptibility to infection, including ‘MDCK.5F1’ cells (ATCC CRL 12042). It is possible to use a mixture of more than one cell type to practise the methods of the present invention. However, it is preferred that the methods of the invention are practised with a single cell type e.g. with monoclonal cells. Preferably, the cells used in the methods of the present invention are from a single cell line. Furthermore, the same cell line may be used for reassorting the virus and for any subsequent propagation of the virus. Preferably, the cells are cultured in the absence of serum, to avoid a common source of contaminants. Various serum-free media for eukaryotic cell culture are known to the person skilled in the art (e.g. Iscove's medium, ultra CHO medium (BioWhittaker), EX-CELL (JRH Biosciences)). Furthermore, protein-free media may be used (e.g. PF-CHO (JRH Biosciences)). Otherwise, the cells for replication can also be cultured in the customary serum-containing media (e.g. MEM or DMEM medium with 0.5% to 10% of fetal calf serum). The cells may be in adherent culture or in suspension. Conventional Reassortment Traditionally, influenza viruses are reassorted by co-infecting a culture host, usually eggs, with a donor strain and a vaccine strain. Reassortant viruses are selected by adding antibodies with specificity for the HA and/or NA proteins of the donor strain in order to select for reassortant viruses that contain the vaccine strain's HA and/or NA proteins. Over several passages of this treatment one can select for fast growing reassortant viruses containing the vaccine strain's HA and/or NA segments. The invention is suitable for use in these methods. It can be easier to use vaccine strains with a different HA and/or NA subtype compared to the donor strain(s) as this facilitates selection for reassortant viruses. It is also possible, however, to use vaccine strains with the same HA and/or NA subtype as the donor strain(s) and in some aspects of the invention this preferred. In this case, antibodies with preferential specificity for the HA and/or NA proteins of the donor strain(s) should be available. Virus Preparation In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for producing influenza viruses comprising steps of (a) infecting a culture host with a reassortant virus of the invention; (b) culturing the host from step (a) to produce the virus; and optionally (c) purifying the virus produced in step (b). The culture host may be cells or embryonated hen eggs. Where cells are used as a culture host in this aspect of the invention, it is known that cell culture conditions (e.g. temperature, cell density, pH value, etc.) are variable over a wide range subject to the cell line and the virus employed and can be adapted to the requirements of the application. The following information therefore merely represents guidelines. As mentioned above, cells are preferably cultured in serum-free or protein-free media. Multiplication of the cells can be conducted in accordance with methods known to those of skill in the art. For example, the cells can be cultivated in a perfusion system using ordinary support methods like centrifugation or filtration. Moreover, the cells can be multiplied according to the invention in a fed-batch system before infection. In the context of the present invention, a culture system is referred to as a fed-batch system in which the cells are initially cultured in a batch system and depletion of nutrients (or part of the nutrients) in the medium is compensated by controlled feeding of concentrated nutrients. It can be advantageous to adjust the pH value of the medium during multiplication of cells before infection to a value between pH 6.6 and pH 7.8 and especially between a value between pH 7.2 and pH 7.3. Culturing of cells preferably occurs at a temperature between 30 and 40° C. When culturing the infected cells (step b), the cells are preferably cultured at a temperature of between 30° C. and 36° C. or between 32° C. and 34° C. or at 33° C. This is particularly preferred, as it has been shown that incubation of infected cells in this temperature range results in production of a virus that results in improved efficacy when formulated into a vaccine [27]. Oxygen partial pressure can be adjusted during culturing before infection preferably at a value between 25% and 95% and especially at a value between 35% and 60%. The values for the oxygen partial pressure stated in the context of the invention are based on saturation of air. Infection of cells occurs at a cell density of preferably about 8-25×105 cells/mL in the batch system or preferably about 5-20×106 cells/mL in the perfusion system. The cells can be infected with a viral dose (MOI value, “multiplicity of infection”; corresponds to the number of virus units per cell at the time of infection) between 10−8 and 10, preferably between 0.0001 and 0.5. Virus may be grown on cells in adherent culture or in suspension. Microcarrier cultures can be used. In some embodiments, the cells may thus be adapted for growth in suspension. The methods according to the invention also include harvesting and isolation of viruses or the proteins generated by them. During isolation of viruses or proteins, the cells are separated from the culture medium by standard methods like separation, filtration or ultrafiltration. The viruses or the proteins are then concentrated according to methods sufficiently known to those skilled in the art, like gradient centrifugation, filtration, precipitation, chromatography, etc., and then purified. It is also preferred according to the invention that the viruses are inactivated during or after purification. Virus inactivation can occur, for example, by β-propiolactone or formaldehyde at any point within the purification process. The culture host may be eggs. The current standard method for influenza virus growth for vaccines uses embryonated SPF hen eggs, with virus being purified from the egg contents (allantoic fluid). It is also possible to passage a virus through eggs and subsequently propagate it in cell culture and vice versa. Vaccine The invention utilises virus produced according to the method to produce vaccines. Vaccines (particularly for influenza virus) are generally based either on live virus or on inactivated virus. Inactivated vaccines may be based on whole virions, ‘split’ virions, or on purified surface antigens. Antigens can also be presented in the form of virosomes. The invention can be used for manufacturing any of these types of vaccine. Where an inactivated virus is used, the vaccine may comprise whole virion, split virion, or purified surface antigens (for influenza, including hemagglutinin and, usually, also including neuraminidase). Chemical means for inactivating a virus include treatment with an effective amount of one or more of the following agents: detergents, formaldehyde, β-propiolactone, methylene blue, psoralen, carboxyfullerene (C60), binary ethylamine, acetyl ethyleneimine, or combinations thereof. Non-chemical methods of viral inactivation are known in the art, such as for example UV light or gamma irradiation. Virions can be harvested from virus-containing fluids, e.g. allantoic fluid or cell culture supernatant, by various methods. For example, a purification process may involve zonal centrifugation using a linear sucrose gradient solution that includes detergent to disrupt the virions. Antigens may then be purified, after optional dilution, by diafiltration. Split virions are obtained by treating purified virions with detergents (e.g. ethyl ether, polysorbate 80, deoxycholate, tri-N-butyl phosphate, Triton X-100, Triton N101, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, Tergitol NP9, etc.) to produce subvirion preparations, including the ‘Tween-ether’ splitting process. Methods of splitting influenza viruses, for example are well known in the art e.g. see refs. 28-33, etc. Splitting of the virus is typically carried out by disrupting or fragmenting whole virus, whether infectious or non-infectious with a disrupting concentration of a splitting agent. The disruption results in a full or partial solubilisation of the virus proteins, altering the integrity of the virus. Preferred splitting agents are non-ionic and ionic (e.g. cationic) surfactants e.g. alkylglycosides, alkylthioglycosides, acyl sugars, sulphobetaines, betains, polyoxyethylenealkylethers, N,N-dialkyl-Glucamides, Hecameg, alkylphenoxy-polyethoxyethanols, NP9, quaternary ammonium compounds, sarcosyl, CTABs (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromides), tri-N-butyl phosphate, Cetavlon, myristyltrimethylammonium salts, lipofectin, lipofectamine, and DOT-MA, the octyl- or nonylphenoxy polyoxyethanols (e.g. the Triton surfactants, such as Triton X-100 or Triton N101), polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters (the Tween surfactants), polyoxyethylene ethers, polyoxyethlene esters, etc. One useful splitting procedure uses the consecutive effects of sodium deoxycholate and formaldehyde, and splitting can take place during initial virion purification (e.g. in a sucrose density gradient solution). Thus a splitting process can involve clarification of the virion-containing material (to remove non-virion material), concentration of the harvested virions (e.g. using an adsorption method, such as CaHPO4 adsorption), separation of whole virions from non-virion material, splitting of virions using a splitting agent in a density gradient centrifugation step (e.g. using a sucrose gradient that contains a splitting agent such as sodium deoxycholate), and then filtration (e.g. ultrafiltration) to remove undesired materials. Split virions can usefully be resuspended in sodium phosphate-buffered isotonic sodium chloride solution. Examples of split influenza vaccines are the BEGRIVAC™ FLUARIX™, FLUZONE™ and FLUSHIELD™ products. Purified influenza virus surface antigen vaccines comprise the surface antigens hemagglutinin and, typically, also neuraminidase. Processes for preparing these proteins in purified form are well known in the art. The FLUVIRIN™, AGRIPPAL™ and INFLUVAC™ products are influenza subunit vaccines. Another form of inactivated antigen is the virosome [34] (nucleic acid free viral-like liposomal particles). Virosomes can be prepared by solubilization of virus with a detergent followed by removal of the nucleocapsid and reconstitution of the membrane containing the viral glycoproteins. An alternative method for preparing virosomes involves adding viral membrane glycoproteins to excess amounts of phospholipids, to give liposomes with viral proteins in their membrane. The methods of the invention may also be used to produce live vaccines. Such vaccines are usually prepared by purifying virions from virion-containing fluids. For example, the fluids may be clarified by centrifugation, and stabilized with buffer (e.g. containing sucrose, potassium phosphate, and monosodium glutamate). Various forms of influenza virus vaccine are currently available (e.g. see chapters 17 & 18 of reference 35). Live virus vaccines include MedImmune's FLUMIST™ product (trivalent live virus vaccine). The virus may be attenuated. The virus may be temperature-sensitive. The virus may be cold-adapted. These three features are particularly useful when using live virus as an antigen. HA is the main immunogen in current inactivated influenza vaccines, and vaccine doses are standardised by reference to HA levels, typically measured by SRID. Existing vaccines typically contain about 15 μg of HA per strain, although lower doses can be used e.g. for children, or in pandemic situations, or when using an adjuvant. Fractional doses such as ½ (i.e. 7.5 μg HA per strain), ¼ and ⅛ have been used, as have higher doses (e.g. 3× or 9× doses [36,37]). Thus vaccines may include between 0.1 and 150 μg of HA per influenza strain, preferably between 0.1 and 50 μg e.g. 0.1-20 μg, 0.1-15 μg, 0.1-10 μg, 0.1-7.5 μg, 0.5-5 μg, etc. Particular doses include e.g. about 45, about 30, about 15, about 10, about 7.5, about 5, about 3.8, about 3.75, about 1.9, about 1.5, etc. per strain. For live vaccines, dosing is measured by median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) rather than HA content, and a TCID50 of between 106 and 108 (preferably between 106.5-107.5) per strain is typical. Influenza strains used with the invention may have a natural HA as found in a wild-type virus, or a modified HA. For instance, it is known to modify HA to remove determinants (e.g. hyper-basic regions around the HA1/HA2 cleavage site) that cause a virus to be highly pathogenic in avian species. The use of reverse genetics facilitates such modifications. As well as being suitable for immunizing against inter-pandemic strains, the compositions of the invention are particularly useful for immunizing against pandemic or potentially-pandemic strains. The invention is suitable for vaccinating humans as well as non-human animals. Other strains whose antigens can usefully be included in the compositions are strains which are resistant to antiviral therapy (e.g. resistant to oseltamivir [38] and/or zanamivir), including resistant pandemic strains [39]. Compositions of the invention may include antigen(s) from one or more (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4 or more) influenza virus strains, including influenza A virus and/or influenza B virus provided that at least one influenza strain is a reassortant influenza strain of the invention. Compositions wherein at least two, at least three or all of the antigens are from reassortant influenza strains of the invention are also envisioned. Where a vaccine includes more than one strain of influenza, the different strains are typically grown separately and are mixed after the viruses have been harvested and antigens have been prepared. Thus a process of the invention may include the step of mixing antigens from more than one influenza strain. A trivalent vaccine is typical, including antigens from two influenza A virus strains and one influenza B virus strain. A tetravalent vaccine is also useful [40], including antigens from two influenza A virus strains and two influenza B virus strains, or three influenza A virus strains and one influenza B virus strain. Pharmaceutical Compositions Vaccine compositions manufactured according to the invention are pharmaceutically acceptable. They usually include components in addition to the antigens e.g. they typically include one or more pharmaceutical carrier(s) and/or excipient(s). As described below, adjuvants may also be included. A thorough discussion of such components is available in reference 41. Vaccine compositions will generally be in aqueous form. However, some vaccines may be in dry form, e.g. in the form of injectable solids or dried or polymerized preparations on a patch. Vaccine compositions may include preservatives such as thiomersal or 2-phenoxyethanol. It is preferred, however, that the vaccine should be substantially free from (i.e. less than 5 μg/ml) mercurial material e.g. thiomersal-free [32,42]. Vaccines containing no mercury are more preferred. An α-tocopherol succinate can be included as an alternative to mercurial compounds [32]. Preservative-free vaccines are particularly preferred. To control tonicity, it is preferred to include a physiological salt, such as a sodium salt. Sodium chloride (NaCl) is preferred, which may be present at between 1 and 20 mg/ml. Other salts that may be present include potassium chloride, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium phosphate dehydrate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, etc. Vaccine compositions will generally have an osmolality of between 200 mOsm/kg and 400 mOsm/kg, preferably between 240-360 mOsm/kg, and will more preferably fall within the range of 290-310 mOsm/kg. Osmolality has previously been reported not to have an impact on pain caused by vaccination [43], but keeping osmolality in this range is nevertheless preferred. Vaccine compositions may include one or more buffers. Typical buffers include: a phosphate buffer; a Tris buffer; a borate buffer; a succinate buffer; a histidine buffer (particularly with an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant); or a citrate buffer. Buffers will typically be included in the 5-20 mM range. The pH of a vaccine composition will generally be between 5.0 and 8.1, and more typically between 6.0 and 8.0 e.g. 6.5 and 7.5, or between 7.0 and 7.8. A process of the invention may therefore include a step of adjusting the pH of the bulk vaccine prior to packaging. The vaccine composition is preferably sterile. The vaccine composition is preferably non-pyrogenic e.g. containing <1 EU (endotoxin unit, a standard measure) per dose, and preferably <0.1 EU per dose. The vaccine composition is preferably gluten-free. Vaccine compositions of the invention may include detergent e.g. a polyoxyethylene sorbitan ester surfactant (known as ‘Tweens’), an octoxynol (such as octoxynol-9 (Triton X-100) or t-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol), a cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (‘CTAB’), or sodium deoxycholate, particularly for a split or surface antigen vaccine. The detergent may be present only at trace amounts. Thus the vaccine may include less than 1 mg/ml of each of octoxynol-10 and polysorbate 80. Other residual components in trace amounts could be antibiotics (e.g. neomycin, kanamycin, polymyxin B). A vaccine composition may include material for a single immunisation, or may include material for multiple immunisations (i.e. a ‘multidose’ kit). The inclusion of a preservative is preferred in multidose arrangements. As an alternative (or in addition) to including a preservative in multidose compositions, the compositions may be contained in a container having an aseptic adaptor for removal of material. Influenza vaccines are typically administered in a dosage volume of about 0.5 ml, although a half dose (i.e. about 0.25 ml) may be administered to children. Compositions and kits are preferably stored at between 2° C. and 8° C. They should not be frozen. They should ideally be kept out of direct light. Host Cell DNA Where virus has been isolated and/or grown on a cell line, it is standard practice to minimize the amount of residual cell line DNA in the final vaccine, in order to minimize any potential oncogenic activity of the DNA. Thus a vaccine composition prepared according to the invention preferably contains less than 10 ng (preferably less than ing, and more preferably less than 100 pg) of residual host cell DNA per dose, although trace amounts of host cell DNA may be present. It is preferred that the average length of any residual host cell DNA is less than 500 bp e.g. less than 400 bp, less than 300 bp, less than 200 bp, less than 100 bp, etc. Contaminating DNA can be removed during vaccine preparation using standard purification procedures e.g. chromatography, etc. Removal of residual host cell DNA can be enhanced by nuclease treatment e.g. by using a DNase. A convenient method for reducing host cell DNA contamination is disclosed in references 44 & 45, involving a two-step treatment, first using a DNase (e.g. Benzonase), which may be used during viral growth, and then a cationic detergent (e.g. CTAB), which may be used during virion disruption. Treatment with an alkylating agent, such as β-propiolactone, can also be used to remove host cell DNA, and advantageously may also be used to inactivate virions [46]. Adjuvants Compositions of the invention may advantageously include an adjuvant, which can function to enhance the immune responses (humoral and/or cellular) elicited in a subject who receives the composition. Preferred adjuvants comprise oil-in-water emulsions. Various such adjuvants are known, and they typically include at least one oil and at least one surfactant, with the oil(s) and surfactant(s) being biodegradable (metabolisable) and biocompatible. The oil droplets in the emulsion are generally less than 5 μm in diameter, and ideally have a sub-micron diameter, with these small sizes being achieved with a microfluidiser to provide stable emulsions. Droplets with a size less than 220 nm are preferred as they can be subjected to filter sterilization. The emulsion can comprise oils such as those from an animal (such as fish) or vegetable source. Sources for vegetable oils include nuts, seeds and grains. Peanut oil, soybean oil, coconut oil, and olive oil, the most commonly available, exemplify the nut oils. Jojoba oil can be used e.g. obtained from the jojoba bean. Seed oils include safflower oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower seed oil, sesame seed oil and the like. In the grain group, corn oil is the most readily available, but the oil of other cereal grains such as wheat, oats, rye, rice, teff, triticale and the like may also be used. 6-10 carbon fatty acid esters of glycerol and 1,2-propanediol, while not occurring naturally in seed oils, may be prepared by hydrolysis, separation and esterification of the appropriate materials starting from the nut and seed oils. Fats and oils from mammalian milk are metabolizable and may therefore be used in the practice of this invention. The procedures for separation, purification, saponification and other means necessary for obtaining pure oils from animal sources are well known in the art. Most fish contain metabolizable oils which may be readily recovered. For example, cod liver oil, shark liver oils, and whale oil such as spermaceti exemplify several of the fish oils which may be used herein. A number of branched chain oils are synthesized biochemically in 5-carbon isoprene units and are generally referred to as terpenoids. Shark liver oil contains a branched, unsaturated terpenoids known as squalene, 2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyl-2,6,10,14,18,22-tetracosahexaene, which is particularly preferred herein. Squalane, the saturated analog to squalene, is also a preferred oil. Fish oils, including squalene and squalane, are readily available from commercial sources or may be obtained by methods known in the art. Another preferred oil is α-tocopherol (see below). Mixtures of oils can be used. Surfactants can be classified by their ‘HLB’ (hydrophile/lipophile balance). Preferred surfactants of the invention have a HLB of at least 10, preferably at least 15, and more preferably at least 16. The invention can be used with surfactants including, but not limited to: the polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters surfactants (commonly referred to as the Tweens), especially polysorbate 20 and polysorbate 80; copolymers of ethylene oxide (EO), propylene oxide (PO), and/or butylene oxide (BO), sold under the DOWFAX™ tradename, such as linear EO/PO block copolymers; octoxynols, which can vary in the number of repeating ethoxy (oxy-1,2-ethanediyl) groups, with octoxynol-9 (Triton X-100, or t-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol) being of particular interest; (octylphenoxy)polyethoxyethanol (IGEPAL CA-630/NP-40); phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (lecithin); nonylphenol ethoxylates, such as the Tergitol™ NP series; polyoxyethylene fatty ethers derived from lauryl, cetyl, stearyl and oleyl alcohols (known as Brij surfactants), such as triethyleneglycol monolauryl ether (Brij 30); and sorbitan esters (commonly known as the SPANs), such as sorbitan trioleate (Span 85) and sorbitan monolaurate. Non-ionic surfactants are preferred. Preferred surfactants for including in the emulsion are Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate), Span 85 (sorbitan trioleate), lecithin and Triton X-100. Mixtures of surfactants can be used e.g. Tween 80/Span 85 mixtures. A combination of a polyoxyethylene sorbitan ester such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80) and an octoxynol such as t-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (Triton X-100) is also suitable. Another useful combination comprises laureth 9 plus a polyoxyethylene sorbitan ester and/or an octoxynol. Preferred amounts of surfactants (% by weight) are: polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters (such as Tween 80) 0.01 to 1%, in particular about 0.1%; octyl- or nonylphenoxy polyoxyethanols (such as Triton X-100, or other detergents in the Triton series) 0.001 to 0.1%, in particular 0.005 to 0.02%; polyoxyethylene ethers (such as laureth 9) 0.1 to 20%, preferably 0.1 to 10% and in particular 0.1 to 1% or about 0.5%. Where the vaccine contains a split virus, it is preferred that it contains free surfactant in the aqueous phase. This is advantageous as the free surfactant can exert a ‘splitting effect’ on the antigen, thereby disrupting any unsplit virions and/or virion aggregates that might otherwise be present. This can improve the safety of split virus vaccines [47]. Preferred emulsions have an average droplets size of <1 μm e.g. ≦750 nm, ≦500 nm, ≦400 nm, ≦300 nm, ≦250 nm, ≦220 nm, ≦200 nm, or smaller. These droplet sizes can conveniently be achieved by techniques such as microfluidisation. Specific oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants useful with the invention include, but are not limited to: A submicron emulsion of squalene, Tween 80, and Span 85. The composition of the emulsion by volume can be about 5% squalene, about 0.5% polysorbate 80 and about 0.5% Span 85. In weight terms, these ratios become 4.3% squalene, 0.5% polysorbate 80 and 0.48% Span 85. This adjuvant is known as ‘MF59’ [48-50], as described in more detail in Chapter 10 of ref. 51 and chapter 12 of ref. 52. The MF59 emulsion advantageously includes citrate ions e.g. 10 mM sodium citrate buffer.An emulsion comprising squalene, a tocopherol, and polysorbate 80. The emulsion may include phosphate buffered saline. These emulsions may have by volume from 2 to 10% squalene, from 2 to 10% tocopherol and from 0.3 to 3% polysorbate 80, and the weight ratio of squalene:tocopherol is preferably <1 (e.g. 0.90) as this can provide a more stable emulsion. Squalene and polysorbate 80 may be present in a volume ratio of about 5:2 or at a weight ratio of about 11:5. Thus the three components (squalene, tocopherol, polysorbate 80) may be present at a weight ratio of 1068:1186:485 or around 55:61:25. One such emulsion (‘AS03’) can be made by dissolving Tween 80 in PBS to give a 2% solution, then mixing 90 ml of this solution with a mixture of (5 g of DL a tocopherol and 5 ml squalene), then microfluidising the mixture. The resulting emulsion may have submicron oil droplets e.g. with an average diameter of between 100 and 250 nm, preferably about 180 nm. The emulsion may also include a 3-de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A (3d MPL). Another useful emulsion of this type may comprise, per human dose, 0.5-10 mg squalene, 0.5-11 mg tocopherol, and 0.1-4 mg polysorbate 80 [53] e.g. in the ratios discussed above.An emulsion of squalene, a tocopherol, and a Triton detergent (e.g. Triton X-100). The emulsion may also include a 3d-MPL (see below). The emulsion may contain a phosphate buffer.An emulsion comprising a polysorbate (e.g. polysorbate 80), a Triton detergent (e.g. Triton X-100) and a tocopherol (e.g. an α-tocopherol succinate). The emulsion may include these three components at a mass ratio of about 75:11:10 (e.g. 750 μg/ml polysorbate 80, 110 μg/ml Triton X-100 and 100 μg/ml α-tocopherol succinate), and these concentrations should include any contribution of these components from antigens. The emulsion may also include squalene. The emulsion may also include a 3d-MPL (see below). The aqueous phase may contain a phosphate buffer.An emulsion of squalane, polysorbate 80 and poloxamer 401 (“Pluronic™ L121”). The emulsion can be formulated in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4. This emulsion is a useful delivery vehicle for muramyl dipeptides, and has been used with threonyl-MDP in the “SAF-1” adjuvant [54] (0.05-1% Thr-MDP, 5% squalane, 2.5% Pluronic L121 and 0.2% polysorbate 80). It can also be used without the Thr-MDP, as in the “AF” adjuvant [55] (5% squalane, 1.25% Pluronic L121 and 0.2% polysorbate 80). Microfluidisation is preferred.An emulsion comprising squalene, an aqueous solvent, a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether hydrophilic nonionic surfactant (e.g. polyoxyethylene (12) cetostearyl ether) and a hydrophobic nonionic surfactant (e.g. a sorbitan ester or mannide ester, such as sorbitan monoleate or ‘Span 80’). The emulsion is preferably thermoreversible and/or has at least 90% of the oil droplets (by volume) with a size less than 200 nm [56]. The emulsion may also include one or more of: alditol; a cryoprotective agent (e.g. a sugar, such as dodecylmaltoside and/or sucrose); and/or an alkylpolyglycoside. The emulsion may include a TLR4 agonist [57]. Such emulsions may be lyophilized.An emulsion of squalene, poloxamer 105 and Abil-Care [58]. The final concentration (weight) of these components in adjuvanted vaccines are 5% squalene, 4% poloxamer 105 (pluronic polyol) and 2% Abil-Care 85 (Bis-PEG/PPG-16/16 PEG/PPG-16/16 dimethicone; caprylic/capric triglyceride).An emulsion having from 0.5-50% of an oil, 0.1-10% of a phospholipid, and 0.05-5% of a non-ionic surfactant. As described in reference 59, preferred phospholipid components are phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, sphingomyelin and cardiolipin. Submicron droplet sizes are advantageous.A submicron oil-in-water emulsion of a non-metabolisable oil (such as light mineral oil) and at least one surfactant (such as lecithin, Tween 80 or Span 80). Additives may be included, such as QuilA saponin, cholesterol, a saponin-lipophile conjugate (such as GPI-0100, described in reference 60, produced by addition of aliphatic amine to desacylsaponin via the carboxyl group of glucuronic acid), dimethyidioctadecylammonium bromide and/or N,N-dioctadecyl-N,N-bis (2-hydroxyethyl)propanediamine.An emulsion in which a saponin (e.g. QuilA or QS21) and a sterol (e.g. a cholesterol) are associated as helical micelles [61].An emulsion comprising a mineral oil, a non-ionic lipophilic ethoxylated fatty alcohol, and a non-ionic hydrophilic surfactant (e.g. an ethoxylated fatty alcohol and/or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer) [62].An emulsion comprising a mineral oil, a non-ionic hydrophilic ethoxylated fatty alcohol, and a non-ionic lipophilic surfactant (e.g. an ethoxylated fatty alcohol and/or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer) [62]. In some embodiments an emulsion may be mixed with antigen extemporaneously, at the time of delivery, and thus the adjuvant and antigen may be kept separately in a packaged or distributed vaccine, ready for final formulation at the time of use. In other embodiments an emulsion is mixed with antigen during manufacture, and thus the composition is packaged in a liquid adjuvanted form. The antigen will generally be in an aqueous form, such that the vaccine is finally prepared by mixing two liquids. The volume ratio of the two liquids for mixing can vary (e.g. between 5:1 and 1:5) but is generally about 1:1. Where concentrations of components are given in the above descriptions of specific emulsions, these concentrations are typically for an undiluted composition, and the concentration after mixing with an antigen solution will thus decrease. Packaging of Vaccine Compositions Suitable containers for compositions of the invention (or kit components) include vials, syringes (e.g. disposable syringes), nasal sprays, etc. These containers should be sterile. Where a composition/component is located in a vial, the vial is preferably made of a glass or plastic material. The vial is preferably sterilized before the composition is added to it. To avoid problems with latex-sensitive patients, vials are preferably sealed with a latex-free stopper, and the absence of latex in all packaging material is preferred. The vial may include a single dose of vaccine, or it may include more than one dose (a ‘multidose’ vial) e.g. 10 doses. Preferred vials are made of colourless glass. A vial can have a cap (e.g. a Luer lock) adapted such that a pre-filled syringe can be inserted into the cap, the contents of the syringe can be expelled into the vial (e.g. to reconstitute lyophilised material therein), and the contents of the vial can be removed back into the syringe. After removal of the syringe from the vial, a needle can then be attached and the composition can be administered to a patient. The cap is preferably located inside a seal or cover, such that the seal or cover has to be removed before the cap can be accessed. A vial may have a cap that permits aseptic removal of its contents, particularly for multidose vials. Where a component is packaged into a syringe, the syringe may have a needle attached to it. If a needle is not attached, a separate needle may be supplied with the syringe for assembly and use. Such a needle may be sheathed. Safety needles are preferred. 1-inch 23-gauge, 1-inch 25-gauge and 5/8-inch 25-gauge needles are typical. Syringes may be provided with peel-off labels on which the lot number, influenza season and expiration date of the contents may be printed, to facilitate record keeping. The plunger in the syringe preferably has a stopper to prevent the plunger from being accidentally removed during aspiration. The syringes may have a latex rubber cap and/or plunger. Disposable syringes contain a single dose of vaccine. The syringe will generally have a tip cap to seal the tip prior to attachment of a needle, and the tip cap is preferably made of a butyl rubber. If the syringe and needle are packaged separately then the needle is preferably fitted with a butyl rubber shield. Preferred syringes are those marketed under the trade name “Tip-Lok”™. Containers may be marked to show a half-dose volume e.g. to facilitate delivery to children. For instance, a syringe containing a 0.5 ml dose may have a mark showing a 0.25 ml volume. Where a glass container (e.g. a syringe or a vial) is used, then it is preferred to use a container made from a borosilicate glass rather than from a soda lime glass. A kit or composition may be packaged (e.g. in the same box) with a leaflet including details of the vaccine e.g. instructions for administration, details of the antigens within the vaccine, etc. The instructions may also contain warnings e.g. to keep a solution of adrenaline readily available in case of anaphylactic reaction following vaccination, etc. Methods of Treatment, and Administration of the Vaccine The invention provides a vaccine manufactured according to the invention. These vaccine compositions are suitable for administration to human or non-human animal subjects, such as pigs or birds, and the invention provides a method of raising an immune response in a subject, comprising the step of administering a composition of the invention to the subject. The invention also provides a composition of the invention for use as a medicament, and provides the use of a composition of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for raising an immune response in a subject. The immune response raised by these methods and uses will generally include an antibody response, preferably a protective antibody response. Methods for assessing antibody responses, neutralising capability and protection after influenza virus vaccination are well known in the art. Human studies have shown that antibody titers against hemagglutinin of human influenza virus are correlated with protection (a serum sample hemagglutination-inhibition titer of about 30-40 gives around 50% protection from infection by a homologous virus) [63]. Antibody responses are typically measured by hemagglutination inhibition, by microneutralisation, by single radial immunodiffusion (SRID), and/or by single radial hemolysis (SRH). These assay techniques are well known in the art. Compositions of the invention can be administered in various ways. The most preferred immunisation route is by intramuscular injection (e.g. into the arm or leg), but other available routes include subcutaneous injection, intranasal [64-66], oral [67], intradermal [68,69], transcutaneous, transdermal [70], etc. Vaccines prepared according to the invention may be used to treat both children and adults. Influenza vaccines are currently recommended for use in pediatric and adult immunisation, from the age of 6 months. Thus a human subject may be less than 1 year old, 1-5 years old, 5-15 years old, 15-55 years old, or at least 55 years old. Preferred subjects for receiving the vaccines are the elderly (e.g. ≧50 years old, ≧60 years old, and preferably ≧65 years), the young (e.g. <5 years old), hospitalised subjects, healthcare workers, armed service and military personnel, pregnant women, the chronically ill, immunodeficient subjects, subjects who have taken an antiviral compound (e.g. an oseltamivir or zanamivir compound; see below) in the 7 days prior to receiving the vaccine, people with egg allergies and people travelling abroad. The vaccines are not suitable solely for these groups, however, and may be used more generally in a population. For pandemic strains, administration to all age groups is preferred. Preferred compositions of the invention satisfy 1, 2 or 3 of the CPMP criteria for efficacy. In adults (18-60 years), these criteria are: (1) ≧70% seroprotection; (2) ≧40% seroconversion; and/or (3) a GMT increase of ≧2.5-fold. In elderly (≧60 years), these criteria are: (1) ≧60% seroprotection; (2) ≧30% seroconversion; and/or (3) a GMT increase of ≧2-fold. These criteria are based on open label studies with at least 50 patients. Treatment can be by a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule. Multiple doses may be used in a primary immunisation schedule and/or in a booster immunisation schedule. In a multiple dose schedule the various doses may be given by the same or different routes e.g. a parenteral prime and mucosal boost, a mucosal prime and parenteral boost, etc. Administration of more than one dose (typically two doses) is particularly useful in immunologically naïve patients e.g. for people who have never received an influenza vaccine before, or for vaccinating against a new HA subtype (as in a pandemic outbreak). Multiple doses will typically be administered at least 1 week apart (e.g. about 2 weeks, about 3 weeks, about 4 weeks, about 6 weeks, about 8 weeks, about 10 weeks, about 12 weeks, about 16 weeks, etc.). Vaccines produced by the invention may be administered to patients at substantially the same time as (e.g. during the same medical consultation or visit to a healthcare professional or vaccination centre) other vaccines e.g. at substantially the same time as a measles vaccine, a mumps vaccine, a rubella vaccine, a MMR vaccine, a varicella vaccine, a MMRV vaccine, a diphtheria vaccine, a tetanus vaccine, a pertussis vaccine, a DTP vaccine, a conjugated H. influenzae type b vaccine, an inactivated poliovirus vaccine, a hepatitis B virus vaccine, a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (such as a tetravalent A-C-W135-Y vaccine), a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, etc. Administration at substantially the same time as a pneumococcal vaccine and/or a meningococcal vaccine is particularly useful in elderly patients. Similarly, vaccines of the invention may be administered to patients at substantially the same time as (e.g. during the same medical consultation or visit to a healthcare professional) an antiviral compound, and in particular an antiviral compound active against influenza virus (e.g. oseltamivir and/or zanamivir). These antivirals include neuraminidase inhibitors, such as a (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetylamino-5-amino-3(1-ethylpropoxy)-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid or 5-(acetylamino)-4-[(aminoiminomethyl)-amino]-2,6-anhydro-3,4,5-trideoxy-D-glycero-D-galactonon-2-enonic acid, including esters thereof (e.g. the ethyl esters) and salts thereof (e.g. the phosphate salts). A preferred antiviral is (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetylamino-5-amino-3(1-ethylpropoxy)-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid, ethyl ester, phosphate (1:1), also known as oseltamivir phosphate (TAMIFLU™). General The term “comprising” encompasses “including” as well as “consisting” e.g. a composition “comprising” X may consist exclusively of X or may include something additional e.g. X+Y. The word “substantially” does not exclude “completely” e.g. a composition which is “substantially free” from Y may be completely free from Y. Where necessary, the word “substantially” may be omitted from the definition of the invention. The term “about” in relation to a numerical value x is optional and means, for example, x±10%. Unless specifically stated, a process comprising a step of mixing two or more components does not require any specific order of mixing. Thus components can be mixed in any order. Where there are three components then two components can be combined with each other, and then the combination may be combined with the third component, etc. The various steps of the methods may be carried out at the same or different times, in the same or different geographical locations, e.g. countries, and by the same or different people or entities. Where animal (and particularly bovine) materials are used in the culture of cells, they should be obtained from sources that are free from transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), and in particular free from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Overall, it is preferred to culture cells in the total absence of animal-derived materials. Where a compound is administered to the body as part of a composition then that compound may alternatively be replaced by a suitable prodrug. References to a percentage sequence identity between two amino acid sequences means that, when aligned, that percentage of amino acids are the same in comparing the two sequences. This alignment and the percent homology or sequence identity can be determined using software programs known in the art, for example those described in section 7.7.18 of reference 71. A preferred alignment is determined by the Smith-Waterman homology search algorithm using an affine gap search with a gap open penalty of 12 and a gap extension penalty of 2, BLOSUM matrix of 62. The Smith-Waterman homology search algorithm is taught in reference 72. References to a percentage sequence identity between two nucleic acid sequences mean that, when aligned, that percentage of bases are the same in comparing the two sequences. This alignment and the percent homology or sequence identity can be determined using software programs known in the art, for example those described in section 7.7.18 of reference 71. A preferred alignment program is GCG Gap (Genetics Computer Group, Wisconsin, Suite Version 10.1), preferably using default parameters, which are as follows: open gap=3; extend gap=1.

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Development of New Donor Strains In order to provide high-growth donor strains, the inventors found that a reassortant influenza virus comprising the PB1 segment of A/California/07/09 and all other backbone segments from PR8-X shows improved growth characteristics compared with reassortant influenza viruses which contain all backbone segments from PR8-X. This influenza backbone is referred to as #21. Focus-Forming Assays (FFA) For the FFA, uninfected MDCK cells are plated at a density of 1.8×104 cells/well in 96 well plates in 100 μl of DMEM with 10% FCS. The next day, medium is aspirated and cells are infected with viruses in a volume of 50 μl (viruses diluted in DMEM+1% FCS). The cells are incubated at 37° C. until the next day. At several time points after infection, the medium is aspirated and the cells washed once with PBS. 50 μl of ice-cold 50%/50% acetone-methanol is added to each well followed by incubation at −20° C. for 30 minutes. The acetone mix is aspirated and the cells washed once with PBST (PBS+0.1% Tween). 50 μl of 2% BSA in PBS is added to each well followed by incubation at room temperature (RT) for 30 minutes. 50 μl of a 1:6000 dilution of anti-NP is added in blocking buffer followed by incubation at RT for 1 hours. The antibody solution is aspirated and the cells washed three times with PBST. Secondary antibody (goat anti mouse) is added at a dilution 1:2000 in 50 μl blocking buffer and the plate is incubated at RT for 1 hours. The antibody solution is aspirated and the cells washed three times with PBST. 50 μl of KPL True Blue is added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes. The reaction is stopped by aspirating the True-Blue and washing once with dH2O. The water is aspirated and the cells are left to dry. Growth Characteristics of Reassortant Viruses Containing PR8-X or #21 Backbones In order to test the suitability of the #21 strain as a donor strain for virus reassortment, reassortant influenza viruses are produced by reverse genetics which contain the HA and NA proteins from various influenza strains (including zoonotic, seasonal, and pandemic-like strains) and the other viral segments from either PR8-X or the #21 backbone. The HA content, HA yield and the viral titres of these reassortant viruses are determined. As a control a reference vaccine strain which does not contain any backbone segments from PR8-X or A/California/07109 is used. These viruses are cultured either in embyronated chicken eggs or in MDCK cells. The results indicate that reassortant viruses which contain the #21 backbone consistently give higher viral titres and HA yields compared with the control virus and the virus which contains all backbone segments from PR8-X in both eggs and cell culture. This difference is due to the PB1 segment because this is the only difference between #21 reassortants and PR8-X reassortants (see FIGS. 1 to 4). Growth Characteristics of Reassortant Viruses Containing PR8-X or Canine Adapted PR8-X Backbones In order to test the effect of canine-adapted mutations on the growth characteristics of PR8-X, the inventors introduce mutations into the PA segment (E327K, N444D, and N675D), or the NP segment (A27T, E375N) of PR8-X. These backbones are referred to as PR8-X(cPA) and PR8-X(cNP), respectively. Reassortant influenza viruses are produced containing the PR8-X(cPA) and PR8-X(cNP) backbones and the HA and NA segments of a pandemic-like H1 influenza strain (strain 1) or a H3 influenza strain (strain 2). As a control a reference vaccine strain which does not contain any backbone segments from PR8-X is used. The reassortant influenza viruses are cultured in MDCK cells. The results show that reassortant influenza viruses which contain canine-adapted backbone segments consistently grow to higher viral titres compared with reassortant influenza viruses which contain unmodified PR8-X backbone segments (see FIGS. 8 and 9). Growth Characteristics of Reassortant Viruses Containing PR8-X, #21 or #21C Backbones In order to test whether canine-adapted mutations in the backbone segments improve the growth characteristics of the #21 backbone, the inventors modify the #21 backbone by introducing mutations into the PR8-X PB2 segment (R389K, T559N). This backbone is referred to as #2 IC. Reassortant influenza viruses are produced by reverse genetics which contain the HA and NA proteins from two different pandemic-like H1 strains (strains 1 and 2) and the other viral segments from either PR8-X, the #21 backbone or the #21C backbone. As a control a reference vaccine strain which does not contain any backbone segments from PR8-X or A/California/07/09 is used. These viruses are cultured in MDCK cells. The virus yield of these reassortant viruses is determined. For reassortant influenza viruses containing the HA and NA segments from the pandemic-like H1 strain (strain 1) and the PR8-X or #21C backbones the HA titres are also determined. The results show that reassortant influenza viruses which contain the #21C backbone consistently grow to higher viral titres compared with reassortant influenza viruses which contain only PR8-X backbone segments or the #21 backbone (see FIGS. 5, 6 and 7). Reassortant influenza viruses comprising the #21C backbone also show higher HA titres compared with PR8-X reassortants. It will be understood that the invention has been described by way of example only and modifications may be made whilst remaining within the scope and spirit of the invention.
