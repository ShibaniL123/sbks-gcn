Therefore, specific structural and. functional, derails disclosed herein are not fo be interpreted as limiting, hut merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention, fCI024| One of the challenges of conventional approaches to automating the disinfection of room air and surfaces includes the distribution of IJV-C in. an efficient, and effective manner, IJV-C: is a high frequency wavelength of light within the ultraviolet band shown to be bactericidal, UV-C has -wavelengths, of from about 1.00 nanometers to about :280 nanometers, Treatment rime can he critical for commercial applications of automating such disinfection, A thorough, and ubiquitous treatment of the room air and surfaces may he required for a process improvement over manual methods. The total amount of UV-C that is available' for irradiating an area. Is typically limited by the amount of power available to make UV-C from standard electrical commercial and residential building circuits. Health care facilities are generally limited to a .standard 20 A.rnp service and other facilities may have either 15 or 20 amp service. A system that docs not manage the available power will almost assuredly waste UV-C output and. prolong treatment time. f'002'SJ A number of -conventional approaches: fo disinfecting an area by Irradiating the area with UV-C are known in the art, A first conventional approach to irradiating an area includes manually positioning lamps and. measuring lamp output in target locations in. order to ensure that a desired germicidal dose is achieved, litis first conventional, approach reduces and may minimize the required treatment time. However, this first conventional approach may require a significant amount of setup dree due to the manual positioning of lamps, {'9026J A second conventional approach to Irradiating an area includes arbitrary lamp positioning. This second conventional approach reduces setup time because of the arbitrary positioning of lamps, However, this second conventional approach typically requires an overwhelming dose of UV-C to achieve disinfection because the lamps are frequently not positioned in. optimum, locations. Such an overwhelming dose of UV-C may be impractical due to high lamp output requirements or an extended treatment time requirement. fO027j A. third convention approach to irradiating an .area includes arbitrary lamp positioning in conjunction with a reflectance-based endpoint detection. The endpoint can be detected using directional reflectance-only sensors to detect a cumulative amount of reflected UV-G. The UY-C reflectance may be read continuously until a predetermined amount of reflected 'UV-C is measured ΐη one or more treatment zones. This third conventional approach makes more efficient nse: of power and time resources than the second conventional approach, However, the third conventional approach makes less efficient use of power and time resources than the first conventional approach.

Embodiments of the subject matter disclosed herein provide methods usable for irradiating an area with radiant energy. In a first particular embodiment, a method is performed by an irradiation system.

In a second particular embodiment, the methods include the method described above with: respect to the first particular embodiment, ffttLTl] Embodiments of the subject matter disclosed herein provide systems and apparatuses usable for irradiating an area. In a third particular embodiment, an apparatus comprises a plurality of radiant-energy emitters, a plurality of radiant-energy sensors, and control logic. Each, radiant-energy emitter of the plurality of radiant-energy emitters emits an adjustable flux of radiant energy during operation, of the apparatus, The radiant energy includes ultraviolet light having a wavelength in a range from about 100 nanometers to about 280 nanometers (UV-€j. Each radiant-energy sensor of the plurality of radiant-energy sensors detects an amount of radiant energy during operation, of the apparatus. The amount of radiant energy detected at each radiant-energy sensor of the plurality of radiant-energy sensors is the UV-C field strength that is created, by the radiant-energy emitters and primariis includes direct radiant energy from, at least one radiant-energy emitter of the plurality of radiant-energy emitters. The: control logic adjusts the adjustable flux of radiant, energy emitted from each of the plurality of radiant-energy emitters during operation, of the apparatus until the amount of radiant energy detected at each of the plurality of radiant-energy sensorsis approximately equal f 1)032) The control logic terminates emitting of the radiant energy from each radiant-energy emitter of the plurality of radiant-energy emitters when a total, amount of radiant energy emitted from the plurality of radiant-energy emitters during operation of the apparatus exceeds a threshold value that is substantially sufficient to allow the total amount of radiant energy emitted from the plurality of radiant-energy emitters to sanitize a particular area in which the apparatus is located. Sanitising a particular area may include disinfecting one or more surfaces in the particular area. Sanitizing a particular area, may include sterilizing one or more surfaces in, the particular area. In particular embodiments, sanitizing includes disinfecting at least one surface in the particular area and sterilizing at least one surface in the particular areal f)M)33j Figure 1. shows a block diagram of a room 100 treatable in. accordance with an example embodiment of an irradiation, system ! 30, The room 1.00 may include a left wall. 1.02, a rear wall 104, a right wall 104 a front wall 108, a door 110, two beds (collectively 122), two chairs (collectively 124), aid an irradiation system 130. In particular embodiments, the room 100 is a hospital room.. la particular embodiments, the irradiation system may he mobile for adjustable positioning within the room 100. The irradiation system 1.30 may include eight adjustable radiant-energy emitters (collectively 132), two of which are labeled m: Figure 1. The irradiation system 130 also may include eight radiant-energy sensors (collectively 134), four of which are labeled in Figure: 1. hi particular embodiments, the adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132 include a low-pressure mercury amalgam lamp. In 'particular embodiments, the adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132 emit UV-C. [0034] In. particular embodiments, the radiant-energy sensors 134 include a. wide-angle cosine-corrected UV-C probe, Cosine corrected sensors are designed to detect UV-C in a. 60 degree window in. order to measure UV-C flucuec within the window, ensuring the measurement of direct radiant energy, In particular embodiments, the irradiation system includes sixteen adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132 (200 Watts each.) and eight radiant-energy sensors 134 (Cosine Corrected Righ Sensitivity, UV-C specific), in, particular embodiments, the radiant-energy sensors 134 are photo-diodes filtered for the detection of only UV-C wavelengths. In particular embodiments, cosine correction, may be achieved by using a TEFLON® filter that fits over the photo-diode. In particular embodiments, the radiant-energy sensors 134 are positioned above and forward of every other radiant-energy emitter 132, and protrude into the mom 100 to achieve wide angle detection, hi particular embodiments, the radiant-energy sensors 134 may be angled to face down 1-3 degrees in order to improve die collection of primary field radiant energy from the radiant-energy emitters 132, |M3Sj The irradiation system 130 may also include - a hygrometer 140. The irradiation system 130 may further include control logic (not shown), a power component 136, a battery pack 1.38, and. two power cords (collectively 142). The control, logic may control, the operation pf the irradiation system 130 and may include both, hardware and software. For example, the control logic may include a processor, memory, and circuitry that connect the processor to the memory and. to Other components of the irradiation system 130. The memory may include instructions that, when executed by the processor, enables the irradiation system 130 to perform operations described herein. fO036j During operation., the power component 136 receives electrical power from one or more power sources and user the received electrical power to power the irradiation system 130, 'The amount of power .available from a single power circuit can limit the flux of radiant energy that can be emitted from, the irradiation system 130. Thus, the power component. 136 is designed to be able to receive electrical power from a plurality .of-power sources. For example, the power cords 142 may be connected to two different power circuits (he,, two different power sources). The battery pack 133 may be an additional source of electrical power to the power component 136. When the power component 136 receives electrical, power from a plurality of power soorces, the irradiation system: 1.30 can emit more radiant, energy in a particular amount of time than when the power: component 136 receives electrical power from, a single power source. When the power component 136 receives electrical po wer from a plurality of po wer sources, the irradiation system 130 can. emit the same amount of radiant energy in a shorter amount of time than when the power component 136 receives electrical power from a single power source. The single power sonree may he a single power cord 142 connected to a single power eirctut. Also, the single: power source may be the battery pack 138, ftM)37j Each adjustable radiant-energy emitter 1.32 of the plurality of adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132 emits an adjustable flux of radiant energy during operation of the irradiation system. 130. Each radiant-energy sensor 134 of the plurality of radiant-energy sensors 134 detects radiant energy during the Operation of the irradiation system. 130. The radiant energy detected at each radiant-energy sensor 134 is the: UV-C field created by the radiant-energy emitters 132 and primarily includes an. amount of radiant energy directly from at least one adjustable radiani-energy emitter 132 of the plurality of adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132, Each radiant-energy sensor 1.34 may also receive radiant energy from other radiant-energy emitters 132 and radiant energy from, other sources. For example, each radiant-energy sensor 134 may receive radiant energy that has been reflected off of the wails 102, 1(14, 106, 108, furniture 122, 1.24 in the room 100, or off of any device itself, for example. In this embodiment, however, there is no mechanism to measure the radiant energy from a primary radiant-energy emitter, a secondary radiant-energy emitter, any reflected radiant energy, or the source of the reflected radiant, energy. The radiant-energy sensors 134 detect the strength of the entire radiant energy field created, primarily by the radiant-energy emitters 132 directly so that the irradiation system 130 may adjust the radiant-energy emitters 132 to balance the field through the use of control logic. The control logic may adjust each of the plurality of adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132 during operation of the irradiation system 130 until the amount of radiant energy detected at each radiant-energy sensor is approximately equal. The control logic may adjust an adjustable radiant-energy emitter 132 by 1) adjusting the adjustable flux, of radiant energy emitted from the adjustable radiant-energy emitter 132, 2) adjusting the positron of tire adjustable radiant-energy emitter 132, or 3) by adjusting a reflector at the adjustable radiant-energy emitter 132, ftfOSSj The adjustment of each adjustable flux may emulate the movement of an adjustable radiant-energy emitter 132 closer to an area of the mom. 100 or emulate the movement of an adjustable radiant-energy emitter 132 .further, torn an area of the mom 100. For example, a first adjustable radiant-energy emitter 132-1 may be emitting more radiant energy than is needed because of the proximity of the left: wall 102 and the front wall' 10Β to the adjustable radiant-energy emitter 132-1, A second adjustable radiant-energy emitter 132-2 may not be emitting a sufficient amount of radiant energy because of the distance of die rear wail 1.04 and. the right wall 106 from the radiant-energy emitter 132-2, That is, the radiant energy emitted from the first adjustable radiaut-energy emitter 132-1 is being applied to a smaller area than the area to which the radiant energy emitted fern the second adjustable radiant-energy emitter 132-2 is being applied. Additionally, there are objects fe,g,, first bed 122-1, second bed 122-2, and second, chair 1.24-2) in the general area to 'which the radiant energy emitted from the second adjustable radiant-energy emitter 132-2 is being applied, hi particular embodiments, the amount of rad iant energy detected at first radiant-energy sensor 134-1 and second radiant-energy sensor 134-2 will be greater than the amount of radiant energy detected at the third radiaut-energy sensor 134-3 and the fourth radiant-energy sensor 134-4. The control logic may decrease the flux of radiant energy emitted from the first adjustable radiant-energy emitter 132-1, emulating a movement of the first radiant-energy emitter 132-3 away from that area. Similarly, the control, logic may increase the: flux of radiant energy emitted from, the second, -adjustable radiaut-energy emitter 132-2, emulating movement of the seeond adjustable radiant-energy emitter 1.32-2 toward, that area, |0fl39] The irradiation system 130 may continue adjusting the adjustable flux of radiant energy emitted from each adjustable radiant-energy emitter 132 until the amount of radiant energy detected at each radiant-energy sensor 134 is approximately equal. The adjusting of the adjustable: fluxes may be referred to as field balancing. Similarly, the irradiation system 130 may .continue to adjust the position of each .radiaat-onprgy emitter 132 or continue to adjust a reflector at each radiant-energy emitter 132 until the amount of radiant energy detected art each radiant-energy sensor 134 is approximately equal. It should be holed that, with, the adjustment of radiant-energy emitters 132, more power may be used by a particular radiant-energy emitter 132 that is adjusted to emit radiant energy at a higher level or due to the radiant-energy emitter 132 being worn or not as effective as another radiant-energy emitter 132, for example. Adjusting the radiant-energy emitters 1.32 provides the ability to use the power available to .reduce treatment times, in. one embodiment, the power consumption Is monitored and adjusting of the radiant-energy emitters 132 may he discontinued once the specified available power is reached. Irrespective of whether only a single power source is available or multiple power sources are available as described above, this adjustment of the radiant-energy emitters 132 acts to limit the treatment time for a particular target 1.0040] In particular embodiments, the irradiation system .130 emits radiant energy from each of the adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132 until a total amount of radiant energy emitted from the adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132 reaches or exceeds a threshold value. When the total amount of radiant energy emitted reaches or exceeds the threshold value, the control logic may terminate the emitting of radiant energy from, the adjustable radiant-energy emitters 1.32, In particular embodiments, the threshold value Is sufficient to allow the total amount of radiant energy emitted from the adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132 to sanitize the room 100. In particular embodiments, the threshold value is .Sufficient to allow the total amount of radiant energy emitted from the adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132 to sterilize at least one surface in the room 100. in particular embodiments, the threshold value is sufficient to allow the total amount of radiant energy emitted from the adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132 to polymerize a coating on at least one surface in the room 100. In. particular embodiments, the threshold value is sufficient to allow the total, amount, of radiant energy emitted from the adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132 to cure a polymer-based coating on at least one surface in the room 1.00. In. particular embodiments, the threshold value is sufficient to allow the total amount of radiant energy emitted from the adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132 to oxidize at least one surface in the room 100. In an example embodiment, after a warm-up phase, a baseline IJY-G target value may be determined by taking the average of the radiant energy detected at each radiant-energy sensor 134 with all the radiant-energy emitters 132 set to 90% output. The control logic then attempts to match all the radiant energy values at the radiant-energy sensors 134 to the target value by adjusting the output of each radiant-energy emitter 132 up or down. In an example embodiment the radiant-energy emitters may be adjusted in groups of three, with a primary radiant-energy emitter of the group immediately below one of the radiant-energy sensors 134, and secondary radiant-energy emitters on either si de of the primary radiant-energy emitter, £($42] Figure 2 shows a block diagram of an example embodiment of a quality-control system 200 Including the irradiation system 130 shown in Figure L The network 220 may include a, wireless local area network (WLAN) or the Internet, tor example, The irradiation system. 130 may communicate wirelessly with the database server 210 via the network 220. In particular embodiments, the database server 210 is configured to store information received from the Irradiation system 130 via, the network 220. 10043] The information received from the irradiation system 130 may include location information identifying the.location to he irradiated, with a total amount of radiant energy emitted, from, the adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132. The location information may include the mom. siumher (or other identifying indicia) of the room. 1.00 to be irradiated, The location' information may be provided to the irradiation system 130 by a, user of the irradiation system. 130. In. particular embodiments, the irradiation system 130 includes a user interface allowing a user to .manually enter the .location information to be transmitted to the database server 210. la particular embodiments, the irradiation, system 1.30 includes a. bar code reader and the user can. scan a bar code associated with the particular'room to be irradiated, A bar code may be attached to the front wall 108 near the door 1.10, for example. In particular embodiments, the room 1.00 may include a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag that transmits a unique room identifier to the irradiation system. 130 when the RFID tag is activated by the irradiation system 130. In particular embodiments, the Irradiation system .130 may need to be communicating with the RFID tag in order to emit radiant energy. Requiring: the irradiation system. 1.30 to he communicating with the REID tag; to emit radiant energy may reduce or eliminate errors in the location information transmitted to the database server 210. |IMM4] The Information received from the irradiation system 130 may include information indicating a measure of relative humidity at the location of the irradiation system. BO. High relative humidity can inhibit the germicidal effect of OV-C. in particular embodiments, the irradiation system: BO includes a hygrometer 140. The hygrometer 140 may be a digital hygrometer, in ■particular embodiments, the irradiation system 130 transmits a. measure of relative humidity along with the location information described above. |'0045j After the irradiation system 130 transmits location information to the database server 210, the irradiation system 130 may receive operational information from the database server 210. in particular embodiments, the .operational Information includes the threshold value: described shove. The threshold value may he at least partially based on the location information transmitted to the database server 210, The threshold value may be at feast partially based on relative humidity information transmitted to the database server 210. For example, upon receiving a particular room number from the irradiation system 130, the database server 210 may retrieve specific information related to the particular room. The specific information may include the size of the room, the shape of the room, an inventory of the furniture in the room, and the diagnosis of the last patient to fee in the room, (he., when the room is a hospital room), for example. The database server 2.10 may then use this specific information to determine an appropriate threshold value, and other operational information, to be transmitted to the irradiation system 130. [QQ46] In particular embodiments, the other operational, information Is .at least partial!y based on relative humidity information transmitted to the database server 210. The other operational information may include initial values for the adjustable flux of radiant energy to be emitted from each of the adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132 during operation, of the irradiation, system Β0. in. particular embodiments, the initial valises for the adjustable fluxes are the final, values of the adjustable fluxes at the end of a pre vious operation of the irradiation system 130 in the same room. This may help reduce power consumption in rooms where the irradiation system 130 is frequently placed in approximately the same position each time it is operated, in a particular room. The other operational information may include initial positions for each of the adjustable- radiaat-energy emitters 132. In particular embodiments, the Initial positions for the adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132 are the final positions of the adjustable: radiant-energy emitters 132 at the end of a. previous operation of the: Irradiation system 130 in the same room. The other operational information may include an initial position for each reflector at each adjustable radiant-energy emitter 02, In particular embodiments, the initial position for each reflector at each adjustable radiant-energy emitter 132 is the final position, of the reflector at the end of a previous operation of the irradiation system 130 in the same room, Ift047j hi particular embodiments* the irradiation system 130 collects operational information including information related to the emitting of radiant energy from the adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132, information, related to the detecting of radiant energy at the radiant-energy sensors 134, information related' to the adjusting of adjustable flaxes*, information related to repositioning of adjustable: radiant-energy emitters 1,32, and information related to adjusting of reflectors at adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132. The collected informatics! may he transmitted to the database server 210 via the network 220. The irradiation system 130 may transmit collected information as it is collected during operation of the irradiation system 130. The irradiation, system 130 may also save collected hifomiatfon daring the operation of the irradiation system 130 and then transmit all the collected information near the end. of the operation of the foudkuion system 130. The collected operational infomiation may idelude location identification (e.g„ room number), an operation start time, an. operation end lime, initial values of the adjustable fluxes, interim values of the adjustable fluxes, final values: of the adjustable fluxes, initial positions of adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132, final positions of radiant-energy emitters 1.32, initial positions of reflectors at adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132, final positions of reflectors at adjustable radiant-energy emitters 132, total amount of radiant energy emitted, or any -combination, thereof fCIOdSj In particular embodiments, the database server 21:0 includes software applications to perform quality control operations, For example, the database server 2.10 may receive the collected operational infomiation from the irradiation system 130, store the collected operational infomiation, and generate reports at least partially based, on, the collected, operational data. In. particular embodiments, the reports may he used to keep a history of operations to show compliance with certain regulations, such as government regulations. For example, guidance documents published .by the Health and Human Services agency in the United States emphasize the importance of documenting the proper disinfection of health, care facilities, A system, such as the quality-control system. 200 shown in Figure 2 may automate the documentation of disinfection of rooms in a. healthcare facility. For example, the quality-control system 200 may be used to document which rooms were disinfected, when each room was disinfected, operation parameters depicting how each room was disinfected, winch user was responsible for the disinfection of each room, or arty combination thereof [0040] Figure 3 shows a flow diagram: of an example embodiment of a first method 300 usable for irradiating an area. The first method 300 may be performed by an irradiation: system, such as the irradiation system 130 shown in Figures i and 2. Although the flow diagram indicates Operations proceeding sequentially, an operation, shown later in the sequence may be performed simultaneously with an operation shown earlier in the sequence. For example, operation 330 and operation 340 may be performed, simultaneously, {0950] The first method starts at 310. At 320, the irradiation system emits radiant energy from each adjustable radiant-energy emitter of a plurality of adjustable radiant-energy emitters. {0051] At 330, the irradiation system detects an amount of radiant energy at each radiant-energy sensor of a 'plurality of radiant-energy sensors. The radiant energy detected at each radiant-energy sensor is the strength of the UV-C field and primarily includes an amount of direct radiant energy from at least one adjustable radiant-energy emitter that is disposed nearest the radiant-energy sensor’s location, {9052] At 340, the Irradiation system adjusts each adjustable radiant-energy emitter of the plurality of adjustable radiant-energy emitters until the amount, of radiant, energy detected at each radiant-energy sensor of the plurality of radiant-energy sensors is approximately equal. The first method ends at 350, {00531 Figure 4 shows a. flow diagram of an. example embodiment of a second method 400 usable For irradiating an. area.. The second method. 400 may be performed by an irradiation system, such, as the irradiation system 130 shown in Figs. 1 and 2, 10054] The second method 400 begins at 410, At 420, the irradiation system emits an adjustable amount of flux of radiant energy from each, radiant-energy emitter of a plurality of radiant-energy emitters. f§#SSJ At 430, the irradiation system detects -an., amount of radiant energy at each radiant-energy sensor of a plurality of radiant-energy sensors. At. 440, the irradiation system determines whether the amount of radiant energy detected at each, radiant-energy sensor is approximately equal. fOtSh] If the radiant energy detected at each radiant-energy sensor is not approximately equal., the irradiation system proceeds to 450, If the radiant -energy detected at each radiant-energy sensor of the plurality of radiant-energy sensors is approximately equal, the: irradiation system proceeds to 460, ]M57J At 450, the irradiation system adjusts the adjustable flux of radiant energy emitted from each radiant-energy emitter, Adjusting the adjustable flux does not necessarily mean. that, the adjustable flux: is changed. For example, the irradiation, system may change the adjustable flux at seven of eight radiant-energy emitters sad leave the adjustable flux the same at the eighth: radiant-energy emitter, The adjustable flux, at the eighth radiant-energy emitter is said to have been adjusted. Thus, adjusting au adjustable flux includes determining a new flux value. The new flux value may happen to he the same as the existing flux value. f 0O58J At 460, the irradiation system continues emitting radiant energy until a threshold amount of radiant energy has been, emitted, by the irradiation system.. The irradiation, system may hold the adjustable fluxes constant once they are determined to be approximately equal or the irradiation, system may periodically determine whether one or more of the adjustable - fluxes' ax changed sufficiently to warrant adjusting the adjustable fluxes. At 470, the second method ends. f 1)050 j Figures 5-7 show a flow diagram of an example embodiment of a third method 500 usable for irradiating: an area. The third method 500 may he performed by as irradiation system, such as the irradiation system 130 shown: in Figures .1. and 2, Although, the flow diagram indicates operations proceeding sequentially, an operation shown later in the sequence may be performed Simultaneously with an operation shown, earlier in the sequence. For example, operation 620 and Operation 630 may be performed simultaneously. The third method 500 starts at 510. [0060] At. 520, the irradiation system transmits information to a system. The system may be the database server 21.0 shown m Figure 2, for example, The transmitted information includes an identification of a particular location to be irradiated with, radiant energy by the irradiation system:. For example, the information may include the room, number of the room 100 shown in Figures 1 and 2. At 530, the Irradiation system receives a threshold value from, the system. The threshold value is at least partially based on the information identifying the particular location to he radiated by the irradiation system, {0061} At 540, the irradiation system, receives a plurality of initial values from the system. Each initial value corresponds to a particular radiant-energy emitter of a plurality of radiant-energy emitters. Each, initial, value indicates an initial flux of radiant energy to be emitted from, a corresponding radiant-energy emitter. Each initial value is at least partially based on. the information identifying the particular location to be irradiated.. [0062] At 610, the irradiation system, emits an adjustable flux of radiant energy from, each radiant-energy emitter of the plurality of radiant-energy emitters. The adjustable flux or radiant energy emitted from each radiant-energy emitter is approximately equal to the initial value corresponding to the radiant-energy emitter. [00631 At. 620, the irradiation system, defects an. amount of radiant energy at each radiant-energy sensor of a plurali ty of radiant-energy sensors, [0064] At 630, the irradiation system adjusts the ad justable flux of radiant energy emitted from each of the plurality of radiant-energy emitters until the amount of radiant energy detected at each: of the plurality of radiant-energy sensors is approximately equal. 10β65] At 710, the irradiation system, terminates the emitting of the radiant /energy from each radiani-energy emitter of the plurality of radiant-energy emitters when, a total amount of radiant energy emitted from, the plurality of radiant-energy emitters exceeds the threshold value.

The lamp module 900 is usable in irradiation systems to emit UV-C. For example* the lamp module 900 may be included in the irradiation system 130 shown in Figures 1 and 2. The Samp module 900 may include a cylinder-shaped housing 902 that 'houses a D-shaped tube 904 and a UV-C lamp 906 (shown in Figures 10 and 12). In particular embodiments, the UY-C lamp 906 is an amalgam-type lamp. In particular embodiments, a. U V-C-permeable sleeve made of quartz: glass Is used to maintain lamp temperature at lower power levels. In particular embodiments, the cylinder-shaped housing 902 and the D-shaped tube 904 are made of aluminum to increase reflection of UV-C, The cylinder-shaped housing 90.2 has a window 908 cut into one side of the cylinder-shaped housing 902-to expose either the rounded portion of the 0-shaped. tube 904 or the UV-C lamp 906, depending on whether the lamp module 900 is closed or opened, in Figure 9, the lamp module: 900 is in the closed position so that the rounded portion, of the D~shaped tube 904 is exposed through the window 90S in the cylinder-shaped housing 902. The D-shaped tube 904 may include fins 910 on the rounded-portion of the: D-shaped tube 904 to help provide rigidity to the D~ shaped tube 904. The lamp module 900 includes a socket 912 into which, the UV-C lamp 90b may he inserted' to provide an electrical power source to the UV-C lamp 906, 10074] The lamp module 900 includes a. pneumatic cylinder 914, a rack gear 916, a. pinion gear 918, and. a spring 920, To emit UY-C bom the lamp module 900, electrical power is supplied to the lamp module 900, activating the pneumatic cylinder 914 and the UV-C lamp 106, 'When the pneumatic cylinder 914 is activated it pushes the rack gear 916 away from the pneumatic cylinder 914, depressing the spring 920, The rack gear 916 engages the pinion gear 918, rotating the pinion gear 918 coun ter clockwise as shown in. Figure. 9. The rotation of the pinion gear 918 causes the D-shaped. tube 904 and the UY-C lamp 106 to rotate to the open position (shown: in Figures 11 and 12). 10075! 'Figure .10 shows a second perspective view of the example embodiment of the lamp module 900 shown in. FIG. 9 in a closed position. In Figure 10, the top of the lamp module 900 has been removed, The top of the lamp module 900 includes the pneumatic cylinder 914, the rack gear 916, and the spring 920. 10076] Figure 11 shows a first perspective view of the example embodiment of the lamp module 900 shown in Figures '9 and 10 in an open position, in Figure 11, the pneumatic cylinder 914 has been activated, pushing the tack gear 916 away from the pneumatic cylinder 914, rotating ibe pinion gear 918, and depressing the spring 920. The UV'-C lamp 106 has been rotated to the open position exposing the UV-C lamp 906 through, the window 908 in the cylinder-shaped housing 902. in the open position, the UY-C lamp 906 has electrical power supplied to it, causing it to emit UV-C. The amount of electrical power supplied to the UV-€ lamp 906 may be adjusted to adjust the: flux of the UV~C, |M77J Figure 12 shows a second, perspective view of the example embodiment of the lamp module 900 shown in Figures 9, 10. and 1 1 in an open position, in Figure 12, the top of the lamp module 900 has been removed. The top of the lamp module 900 includes the pneumatic cylinder 914, the rack gear 916, aud the spring 920. The UV-C lamp 906 is rotated to the open position exposing the UV-C lamp 906 through the window 908 in the cylinder-shaped housing 902, f'0078J In the open, position, the UV-C lamp 906 continues until an irradiation system, including the lamp module 900 determines that UV-C no longer needs to be emitted. For example, the control logic of the irradiation system 130 shown in Figures I and 2 may determine that the threshold amount of UV-C Iras been emitted. The irradiation system 130 may shot off electrical power to the lamp module 900. Shutting off electrical power to the lamp module 900 causes the pneumatic cylinder 914 to deactivate and causes the UY-C lamp 106 to stop emitting UV-C. When the pneumatic cylinder 914 is deactivated, the spring 920 expands, pushing the rack gear 916 toward the pneumatic cylinder 914, which causes the pinion gear 918 to rotate clockwise as shown in Figure 12, Rotating the pinion gear 918 clockwise causes the UY-C lamp Κ)6 and the D-shaped tube 904 to rotate to the: closed position shown in Figures 9 and. 101 f0079) Since users of an irradiation system including the: lamp module 900 should not be exposed to the UV-C when the lamp module 900 is emitting UV~C, users will, only be in close proximity to an irradiation system including the lamp module 900 when tire lamp module 900 is in the closed position. In the closed position, the D-shaped tube 904 is exposed to the window 908 of the cylinder-shaped bousing 902 an acts as a protective shield to shield the UV-C lamp 906 from damage. Damage may include breakage or contamination. Contamination, may include contamination from fingerprints. The lamp module 900 may protect users from shattered glass or mercury contamination in the event of a shock sufficient to cause breakage through the cylinder-shaped housing 902 or the D-shaped tube 904, Although lamp module 900 is shown and described herein., it is understood that other lamp module configurations axe also Mly contemplated tor use within irradiation, system 130, [0080] In. particular embodiments, an irradiation system, such as the irradiation system. 130 shown, in Figures .1 and 2 may include a protective shield that protects a plurality of radiant-energy emitters when the irradiation system is not emitting radiant energy. For example, when the irradiation system powers the radiant-energy emitters to emit radiant energy, the irradiation: system may move the protective shield in order to expose the radiant-energy emitters to the area to be irradiated. When, the irradiation system powers down the radiant-energy emitters, the irradiation system may move the protective shield to protect the radiant-energy emitters from exposure to the environment external to the irradiation system tor the same reasons that a D~shaped. tube 904 described above may he used to protect a.radiant-energy emitter, ['9081 j In another example embodiment, the irradiation system 130 may disinfect a space by automatically repositioning radiant-energy emitters 132 from a disengaged, inactive position where emission of radiant energy is terminated (Fig, 13} into a deployed, active position for emission of radiant energy (Fig. 14) that is closer to target surfaces. A radiant-energy emitting fixture 131 housing one or more radiant-energy emitters 132 may be mounted to a wail or ceiling, or he free to move about the room 100 via a robotic drive system. Figure 13 is a schematic representation of an example embodiment of four radiant-energy emitter fixtures 13la-4 in an inactive position, mounted to a ceiling, and Figure 14 depicts eight radiant-energy emitters !32a-d, two from either emitter fixture Bia-d, in an active position extending into the room 100, Figures 16 and 17 illustrate a radiant-energy emitter fixture 131 with two radiant-energy emitters 132 in the inactive and active positions, respectively. As shown, each radiant-energy emitter fixture 131 includes an area 133 for housing electronics and a motor drive system ter moving the radiant-energy emitters 132. In an example embodiment illustrated in. the inset drawing of Figure 1.6, each .radiant-energy emitter 132 may include four OV-C lamps 135 surrounding a reflective coated polycarbonate tube 137, 'wherein, the UV-C lamps 135 may be housed within a. stainless steel rod or wire periphery for safety purposes, Figure 18 depicts an. example embodiment where the radiant-energy emitter fixture 131 houses one radiant-energy emitter 132. [0082] The irradiation system 130 may monitor radiant energy dosing in real time by the reciprocal reading of radiant energy output from a positionaily opposing radiant energy emitter fixtures 131, as illustrated by the arrows in Figure 15. Reciprocal reading of eleciromagnetie emission is accomplished by radiant-energy sensors mounted on an emitter fixture aimed to detect the primary emission of radiant energy fern an opposing emitter fixture. In this way, installation of emitter fixtures and sensors may be simplified and modular, [00831 0& initiation of a disinfection, cycle, control logic may send a command to move radiant-energy emitters 132 from an inactive position into an active position. The radiant-energy emitters 132 are then activated, to begin irradiation of exposed surfaces. Radiant-energy values are detected at die radiant-energy sensors, and control logic may send a command to reposition one or more radiant-energy emitters 132 or reflectors, or to return one or more radiant-energy emitters 132 to the inactive position based on sensor readings. Other orientations besides the inactive and active positions illustrated, herein, such as partial deployment, and more complex movements may be used to achieve optimal, positioning of the radiant-energy emitters 132. The irradiation system .130 can use an accelerometer based, JR reflection detection, IR beam detection, level sensing switch, or motor stall current to sense end of motion of the radiant-energy emitters 132. In one example embodiment, as a safety feature, any object that obstructs the path of the moving radiant-energy emitter 132 stops the radiant-energy emitter 132 without fores from a motor drive system applied, to the obstruction. In another example embodiment, ah: image analysis system may be utilized that has the ability to detect motion and changes in the target, enviromnene which may he important to prevent emitter activation in the event of an obstruction, or occupancy, j'0084'j Several wavelengths of electromagnetic energy are known to he antimicrobial. In: the irradiation system 130, radiant-energy emitters 132 may Include a single antimicrobial wavelength or a combination of several wavelengths to produce an optimal radiant energy flux- infrared energy creates penetrating heat that may he used as an antimicrobial, wherein this wavelength may he valuable for metal surfaces that require high level sterilization. UV-C band energy is a low penetration wavelength that, is antimicrobial and is effective in treating air and hard surfaces, U'V-A and IJV-B band energy are also antimicrobial and penetrate further than UV-C, such that a combination, of A, Β, and C wavelengths may produce an optimized effect. High level, sterilization may be achieved by tire use of x-rays and gamma rays, wherein applications may exist in the food or sierile items industry for these highly penetrating wavelengths. Radio frequencies have been shown to have the capability to be bacteriostatic. Specific applications may exist tor automated ■positioning and sensing radio frequency emission for the purpose of suspending, bacteria! replication.. This technology may branch into the treatment of human disease in vim, wherein: a system may position a. radiant-energy emitter proximal to an infection site and deliver a calibrated bacteriostatic dose to om or more sites. f MSSj In some circumstances it m.ay be desirable to monitor primary radiant energy field in. a remote location. In an example embodiment, a wireless flux sensor system 1900 may he employed as shown in Figures .19 and 20 that includes a sensor 1902* amplifier 1904, A/D converter 1906, broadcast system (Bluetooth, B02.il, RF, or other) 1908, battery system 191.0* and 'photo-voltaic cell 19.12« The photo-voltaic cell 1912 converts flux, into power to charge the battery 1910 and drive the wireless flux sensor .system 1900. {'00861 When using radiant energy to disinfect a mom, the sice of the space, room temperature, and relative humidity effect the time to achieve a required dose. A way to read all three variables so that the information, can be used for treatment timing provides a benefit in. the absence of an ability to read direct radiant energy levels or in conjunction with radiant energy readings to determine an accurate treatment time, Information, regarding one or more of room size (determined via ultrasound, laser, Doppler, or other methods), temperature, and relative humidity, may be forwarded to a control system via low voltage wiring or other wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth, 802,11* RF, or others.
