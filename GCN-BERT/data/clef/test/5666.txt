CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation-in-part application of Ser. No. 12/011,442, filed Jan. 25, 2008 now abandoned. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates generally to tables and more particularly to tables supportable upon generally elongated supports, such as umbrella poles. Still more particularly, it relates to such tables that are capable of displaying various indicia, for example, illustrations of mascots or logos of schools or professional sporting teams and to methods for achieving such display of indicia. BACKGROUND ART Various tables supported on shafts, such as the support pole of a beach umbrella, are known and are shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,920,897 and 6,889,618 and published U.S. Patent Application No. 2004/0129184. Such tables are often called pole caddies, by which term they will be referred to herein. While these tables provided a surface, which may or may not include pockets of various sizes or depths, they lacked sufficient strength for long-term use and further, did not provide a means for users to display their pride in, or allegiance, to a sports team, or other unique organization. Further, the tables of the prior art were singularly absent in any capability for handling vessels with laterally projecting handles or for reducing the tendency of articles thereon to slide off or blow off in windy conditions. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION It is, therefore, an object of the invention to obviate the disadvantages of the prior art. It is another object of the invention to improve shaft-supportable tables. Yet another object of the invention is the enhancement of such tables and the provision of an area on such tables for the display of indicia. Yet another object of the invention is the enhancement of shaft-supportable tables. Still another object of the invention is the provision of a shaft-supportable table that includes structure for maintaining objects in place in windy conditions. Still another object of the invention is the provision of a method for displaying indicia. These objects are accomplished, in one aspect of the invention, by a pole caddy comprising: a planar table portion; and a lateral surround orthogonal to the planar portion, and of a size sufficient to provide added strength as well as an indicia display area. These objects are further accomplished by provision of a pole caddy having an upstanding rim surrounding the planar table portion. The objects are also accomplished in the provision of a table that adequately handles all sorts of vessels, including those with laterally projecting handles. The objects are further accomplished in another aspect of the invention by the provision of a kit containing all of the necessary ingredients for providing a pole caddy with all of the accoutrements to display one's affiliation. The objects are further accomplished by a method of providing the display of indicia, which comprises the steps of forming a table including a relatively large peripheral side and adding identifying indicia to the peripheral sides. The objects are still further accomplished by the provision of table having sides on which the indicia may changed at will.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION For a better understanding of the present invention, together with other and further objects, advantages and capabilities thereof, reference is made to the following disclosure and appended claims taken in conjunction with the above-described drawings. Referring now to the drawings with greater particularity, there is shown in FIG. 1 a pole caddy 10 comprising a planar table portion 12 and a lateral surround 14 orthogonal to the planar portion 12, the lateral surround 14 including an indicia display area 15. The pole caddy is preferably formed from a moldable material, such as, for example, reinforced polypropylene, and the indicia display area is large enough to display illustrations of mascots or other logos to indicate the aforementioned allegiance to a sport team, or, perhaps, loyalty to a company. The planar table portion 12 has a given width X and the lateral surround 14 has a height Y equal to or greater than 0.18 times the given width. Such dimensions provide strength to the table portion and provide adequate space for the display of the desired indicia. In a specific embodiment the planar table portion X is between 13 and 14 inches and the height Y is between 2.5 and 3 inches. The planar table portion 12 includes an upper surface 16 and a bottom surface 18. The upper surface is provided with a plurality of pockets 20 and a tubular projection 32 is formed with a bottom surface 18 of the planar portion 12. The tubular projection 32 receives the shaft of the supporting unit, as will be explained hereinafter. The plurality of pockets 20 can comprise multiple configurations and, as illustrated, circular and square or rectangular configurations are suitable. In a preferred embodiment of the invention at least one of the pockets 20 has a depressed channel 21 leading from the interior of a pocket 20 to the lateral surround 14, the channel 21 providing a receptor for a laterally projecting handle 21a of a vessel 21b, as shown more clearly in FIG. 8. An alternate embodiment of the table is shown in FIGS. 9 and 10 wherein a table 10a has a planar portion 12a and a lateral surround 14a that extends above and below the plane of the planar portion 12a thus providing an upstanding rim 14b that aids in preventing objects placed on the table surface from sliding or blowing off. Additionally, if desired, the bottom portion of the lateral surround 14 can be provided with a plurality of apertures 15 for hanging articles. Another embodiment of the invention is shown in the partial sectional view of FIG. 12, wherein a table 10b has a lateral surround 14c provided with upper and lower rabbets 14d and 14e respectively, allowing indicia to be provided on removable panels so that the indicia can be changed at will. The rabbets 14d and 14e can be molded in to the table ab initio or can be added in the form of clips that attach to the rim 14b and the bottom edge of the lateral surround 14a. In either version of the table, that is, table 10, 10a or 10b, a mount 30 is provided for affixing the table to a support, such as the elongated shaft 28 of an umbrella 24, as shown in FIG. 5a or the shorter shaft 28b of FIG. 5b. The mount 30 comprises the tubular projection 32 formed on the bottom surface 18 of the planar portion 12 and a pole caddy support 34 having a central opening 36 with a diameter A to receive the shaft 28 (or a bushing 42) and an annular receptor 37 to receive the tubular projection 32. Feet 38 (preferably 3 in number, spaced 120° apart) are formed on a bottom 40 of the annular receptor 36 to support the tubular projection 32. The feet 38 insure that the pole caddy 10 is firmly supported. An engager 50, which can take the form of a thumbscrew 41, is provided for fixing and releasing the pole caddy support 34 to the elongated shaft 28. In an embodiment of the invention the pole caddy 10 and its support 34 can comprise a part of a kit that can include an umbrella 24 having an expandable canopy 26 and an elongated shaft 28. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the kit would includes the pole caddy 10, the support 34 and one or more bushings 42, for example, a bushing 42 having an outside diameter A to match the internal diameter of the support 34 formed to fit inside the central opening 36 of the pole caddy support 34 to accommodate multiple shaft diameters in the event it becomes necessary to use a shaft from, for example, a rented umbrella. Alternatively, the kit can comprise a shorter shaft 28a and a base 28b for use, for example, at a swimming pool or other location where an umbrella would be undesired or where a shaft could not conveniently be inserted into the ground. The base 28b, of course, can be used with any embodiment, According to another aspect of the invention, a method of displaying information in an outdoor setting comprises the steps of (a) developing an article with a planar surface, for example, the top of a table capable of holding at least a plurality of objects; (b) providing a 360° lateral surround orthogonal to the planar surface, the lateral surround including an indicia display area; (c) adding displayable information to the lateral surround; and (d) mounting the article in a manner whereby the displayable information is readily visible and understandable to an average observer with average eyesight within a 360° viewing angle. For example, in the case of the article described above, that is, a table, the planar surface can be square or rectangular and thus the lateral surround would of necessity have four sides, each of which would display a similar (or preferably identical) message that would be visible to any person on any side of the table. While the indicia can comprise virtually any intelligence conveying data, the indicia is ideally suited to the display of college mascots or sports' team's logos. Thus, there is provided a pole caddy for displaying indicia and a method for achieving the display of the indicia. A kit is provided also that is strong and easy to assemble and that has a specific provision for the inclusion of display indicia. Further, in a preferred kit version the pole caddy has the capability of accepting multiple diameter shafts.
