Other statistics could include time duration between device on and device off operations, which indicate duration of usage for the riding floor cleaning machine assembly. A seat switch 520 is controlled by the PCB 502 to provide various seat configurations and/or seat safety features, such as engagement or disengagement of the motors when the seat of the assembly is unoccupied. The brush motor interface 508 can be controlled by the PCB 502 to selectively control engagement or disengagement of the brush motor of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly. The PCB 502 can track brush motor usage time by measuring engagement and disengagement of the brush motor. These statistics can be compared against device on and device off periods to determine how long the brush is engaged compared to the overall time frame of device on periods. By way of example, the PCB 502 can measure that the device is in a device on state for two hours, but the brush motor was only in use for 15 minutes. The vacuum motor interface 510 can be utilized by the PCB 502 to control operation of the vacuum motor 44 of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly. The emergency control switch 526 is controlled by the PCB 502 to control operation of an emergency switch of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly. A user can stop operation of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly by actuating the emergency switch. Actuation of the emergency switch is sensed by the PCB 502, causing the PCB 502 to selectively stop the brush motor 300 and vacuum motor 44. In one embodiment, the emergency control switch 526 can be used to selectively disrupt power provided to the traction motor through the traction motor interface 504. The PCB 502 can also control the brush motor 184 and vacuum motor 44, through their respective interfaces, such as brush motor interface 508 and vacuum motor interface 510. As with other components, the PCB 502 can be configured to sense and collect operational details of these devices. The scrub head lifting actuator 514 and the squeegee lifting actuator 516 are also controlled by the PCB 502 in response to user commands received at the control panel 501 to raise the scrub head or squeegee, respectively. The PCB 502 can also control the scrub head and/or squeegee in response to other system feedback such as activation of the emergency stop switch 526. For example, if the emergency stop switch 526 is engaged, the PCB 502 can automatically engage the scrub head or squeegee to lift using the scrub head lifting actuator 514 and the squeegee lifting actuator 516. The break coil 522 can be coupled to the emergency stop switch 526. If the emergency stop switch 526 is engaged, the break coil 522 is activated to bring the assembly to a stop. The traction speed and brake control pedal controller 512 is configured to receive signals from a traction speed and brake control pedal to selectively cause the assembly to translate at various speeds through movement of the traction speed and brake control pedal. The PCB 502 can receive signals from the traction speed and brake control pedal controller 512 so as to track and monitor the movement and translation of the assembly. In some embodiments, the PCB 502 communicates within an intelligent system 600, illustrated in greater detail in FIG. 19. The PCB 502 can include any wired or wireless means of communication such as a wireless communications interface. The wireless communications interface can utilize any protocol for network communication including short range protocols such as Bluetooth, near field communications (NFC), infra-red, and so forth. The wireless communications interface can also include utilize Wi-Fi, a cellular network, or other similar networks using other protocols. FIG. 19 illustrates an example network system of devices. The networked system 600 comprises a plurality of devices 605, 610, and 615, which can all communicatively couple with a management server 620 over a network 625. Each of the plurality of devices 605-615 can be collocated in the same facility, such as a building, factory, school, or other location. In other embodiments, one or more (or all) plurality of devices 605-615 can be remotely located from one another. Each of the plurality of devices 605-615 can gather and report its operational metrics to the management server 620 over the network 625, as will be discussed in greater detail below. Exemplary networks, such as network 625 may include any one or more of, for instance, a local intranet, a PAN (Personal Area Network), a LAN (Local Area Network), a WAN (Wide Area Network), a MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), a virtual private network (VPN), a storage area network (SAN), a frame relay connection, an Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) connection, a synchronous optical network (SONET) connection, a digital T1, T3, E1 or E3 line, Digital Data Service (DDS) connection, DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) connection, an Ethernet connection, an ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) line, a dial-up port such as a V.90, V.34 or V.34bis analog modem connection, a cable modem, an ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) connection, or an FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) or CDDI (Copper Distributed Data Interface) connection. Furthermore, communications may also include links to any of a variety of wireless networks, including 4GLTE (Long Term Evolution), 3GPP (3G Radio Access Network), WAP (Wireless Application Protocol), GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) or TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), cellular phone networks, GPS (Global Positioning System), CDPD (cellular digital packet data), RIM (Research in Motion, Limited) duplex paging network, Bluetooth radio, or an IEEE 802.11-based radio frequency network. The network 620 can further include or interface with any one or more of an RS-232 serial connection, an IEEE-1394 (Fire wire) connection, a Fiber Channel connection, an IrDA (infrared) port, a SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) connection, a USB (Universal Serial Bus) connection or other wired or wireless, digital or analog interface or connection, mesh or Digi® networking. The management server 620 is preferably implemented in a cloud-computing environment. In general, a cloud-based computing environment is a resource that typically combines the computational power of a large grouping of processors and/or that combines the storage capacity of a large grouping of computer memories or storage devices. For example, systems that provide a cloud resource may be utilized exclusively by their owners, such as Google™ or Yahoo!™; or such systems may be accessible to outside users who deploy applications within the computing infrastructure to obtain the benefit of large computational or storage resources. The cloud may be formed, for example, by a network of web servers, with each web server (or at least a plurality thereof) providing processor and/or storage resources. These servers may manage workloads provided by multiple users (e.g., cloud resource customers or other users). Typically, each user places workload demands upon the cloud that vary in real-time, sometimes dramatically. The nature and extent of these variations typically depend on the type of business associated with the user. In operation, each of the plurality of devices 605-615 can communicate with the management server 620, with each of the plurality of devices 605-615 acting as a node within the network. The management server 620 can track metrics about each of the plurality of devices 605-615 by communicating with the PCB on each of the plurality of devices 605-615. In some embodiments, data obtained by the PCB of each of the plurality of devices 605-615 is selectively gathered, obtained, monitored, stored, recorded, and/or analyzed by the management system 620. According to some embodiments, data that is selectively gathered, obtained, monitored, stored, recorded, and/or analyzed, preferably comprises, for example, working time, current, voltage, power, and so forth from, for example, the vacuum motor, lithium-ion battery, traction motor, brush motor, and other components of the riding floor cleaning machine. This data or information is preferably received at the PCB 502 (FIG. 18) which may be associated with the lithium-ion battery positioned in the riding floor cleaning machine 100. That is, the PCB 502 controls the operations of each of the components of the device. As described above, the operational data for each of these components can be captured and logged by the PCB 502 and stored in memory on the PCB 502. In other embodiments, operational data can be stored in memory on the PCB 502 and transmitted asynchronously in batches (according to memory size) to the management server 620. In some embodiments, the operational data can be streamed from the PCB 502 to the management server 620 synchronously. Each device can be managed by assignment of a device ID by the management system. The device ID can be an assigned number, a SIM card number, an IMEI, a MAC address, an IP address, or other similar unique identifier. The device ID can be appended to each communication transmitted by the PCB 502 to the management server 620. Stored data or information is preferably analyzed by the management server 620 for parameter compliance, and if, necessary such data or information is then communicated to, for example, an end user, servicing personal, and/or owner. For example, the owner of a riding floor cleaning machine assembly can set a threshold of hours of operation for the device that are required per week. If the riding floor cleaning machine assembly is not operated for a period of time that meets or exceeds this threshold, the riding floor cleaning machine assembly is identified by the management system 620. The transfer of data with regard to each individual machine will help end users better plan for number of machines and employees at each individual work site. Companies with sizeable cleaning staff, (e.g., contact cleaning companies) will find it relevant and useful. In one embodiment the data or information with regard to usage of each individual machine is collected and transmitted daily at a specific time to, for example, the management server. This will allow end users, as well as, distributors and dealers to access the information that they need, so as to monitor usage of these machines and allow them to extract maximum efficiency during operations. In another embodiment of the present invention, other than information for individual days, cumulative totals and averages are readily available too, and the information is preferably updated through the lifespan of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly. Examples of data or information uploaded on a daily basis include, for example, the number of hours and specific time the machine was in operation during the previous 24 hours, the monthly total hours for machine usage, and the total hours of machine usage. Furthermore, the present invention enables recording and analysis of an accumulation total for working parts like batteries, vacuum motors, drive/traction motors and brush motors. Since each component has a lifespan, it will help distributors, dealers, and owners selectively monitor the exact time when these components (e.g., vacuum motor, brush motor and batteries) need to be changed instead of waiting for them to break down, which will affect the working efficiency of the end users. Another important advantage of having this data or information transfer is that in the event the machine breaks down, (e.g., the vacuum motor, brush motor, etcetera stops working), what has broken down will be selectively transmitted to the appropriate servicing personnel by email and/or cell phone text messaging that is/are responsible for the repairs and maintenance of the machines, management of the end user, and so forth. FIG. 20 is a flowchart of an example method of the present technology. The method includes obtaining 702 operational data for a riding floor cleaning machine assembly, the operational data being generated for any of a battery, a vacuum motor, a drive/traction motor, and a brush motor of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly. As mentioned above, this operational data can be gathered by a PCB (such as PCB 502 of FIG. 18) during operation of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly. The method also comprises communicatively coupling 704 a riding floor cleaning machine assembly with a management server. As mentioned above, this could comprise a wireless communication module of the PCB 502 coupling with the management server over a network connection. Once the riding floor cleaning machine assembly and the management server are communicatively coupled with one another, the method can further comprise the management server querying 706 the riding floor cleaning machine assembly for operational data for any of the battery, vacuum motor, traction motor, and brush motor. For example, the management server can request battery related operational data from the riding floor cleaning machine assembly. As mentioned above, this operational data can be stored on the riding floor cleaning machine assembly in memory of the PCB. In another example, the management server can request operational data for the vacuum and brush motors. In another embodiment, the PCB can upload all operational data gathered since a last communication session with the management server. This operational data can include operational data for each of the battery, vacuum motor, traction motor, and brush motor. In some embodiments, the management server is performing 708 at least one operational data analysis process on the obtained operational data. Examples of operational data analysis include in one example, comparing the operational time frames for the riding floor cleaning machine assembly to an expected operational time frame. For example, the owner of a building will determine an operational time frame that the riding floor cleaning machine assembly should be utilized for. This operational time frame can be calculated from an expected time based on building square footage, or any other quantifiable metric that can be used to set an operational time frame threshold. Once this threshold is established, the management server can compare the actual operational time frame utilized over a given period of time to the operational time frame threshold. If the actual time does not meet or exceed the operational time frame threshold, the management server can alert the owner. Thus, in some embodiments, the method includes transmitting 710 an alert message to an owner of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly if the operational analysis indicates that a threshold violating event has occurred. To be sure, a threshold violating event is any event in which operational data for one or more components of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly do not appropriately compare with an operational threshold. In another example, an operational threshold could include a minimum charging time frame for the riding floor cleaning machine assembly. If the riding floor cleaning machine assembly is not charged for an appropriate amount of time, the battery operation of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly can be compromised. In another example, an operational threshold can be set for the brush motor, which can include a comparison with another operational metric such as total operational time. Assume that the total operational time (e.g., power on to power off) for the riding floor cleaning machine assembly is one hour, but the brush motor is only operational for fifteen minutes of the one hour, it can be deduced that the riding floor cleaning machine assembly was not in actual use for the entire hour. Additional metrics can be gathered by tracking revolutions of the drive/traction motor, which can be extrapolated into square foot coverage of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly. Ideally, drive/traction motor revolutions should be compared to overall operational time to ensure that the riding floor cleaning machine assembly is moving during power on periods. If the riding floor cleaning machine assembly is left on when no work is being accomplished, this can lead to unnecessary battery usage. Knowledge of the approximate square footage of a cleaning area can also be used to determine if the riding floor cleaning machine assembly is being utilized properly. For example, if by counting drive/traction motor revolutions that the riding floor cleaning machine assembly has only cleaned approximately 400 square feet, when the total expected square footage for the cleaning area is 2,000 square feet, the management server can detect this discrepancy and transmit an alert message to the owner or another interested party. FIG. 21 is another flowchart of an example method of the present technology. The method includes a step of detecting 802 a failure of a component of a riding floor cleaning machine assembly during operation of the detecting 802 a failure of a component of a riding floor cleaning machine assembly during operation or startup of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly. For example, the PCB can maintain a set of operational thresholds for each component of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly such as the battery, vacuum motor, drive/traction motor, and brush motor. Whenever any of these components is operating below this expected operational threshold, the failure can be established. Upon detection of a failure, the method includes the PCB establishing 804 communication with a management server, as well as a step of transmitting 806 a fault message to the management server. The fault message can include an indication as to the component that failed, such as a battery, vacuum motor, drive/traction motor, and brush motor. If the failure involves a component of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly that could cause the riding floor cleaning machine assembly to be a safety hazard, the method can include the riding floor cleaning machine assembly receiving 808 an emergency shut down signal from the management server. The method also includes performing 810 an emergency shut down upon receiving the emergency shut down signal from the management server. Examples of emergency shut down procedures are described in greater detail supra. In one embodiment, the method includes an optional step of automatically ordering 812 a replacement part for identified failed component. The riding floor cleaning machine assembly can communicate directly with a third party system over the network to order the replacement part. In another embodiment, the management server can identify the failed component and perform a lookup of the manufacturer of the failed component and forward the request to the third party system or a local inventory system. The management server can order the part automatically as the fault message is received. In another example, a replacement component in inventory can be identified in a repair ticket that is transmitted to a repair technician. In some embodiments, the present invention enables upgrades to the software that end users are using that may address, for example, compatibility issues, or other necessary upgrades. In one embodiment, the management server can push updates to the riding floor cleaning machine assembly during operational data transfer operations, or upon powering up the riding floor cleaning machine assembly. For example, each time the riding floor cleaning machine assembly is powered on, the PCB can link with the management server and query the management server for updates. This can all occur transparently to the end user, unless a short pause in operation of the riding floor cleaning machine assembly is required to implement the update or for safety reasons. FIG. 22 is a diagrammatic representation of an example machine in the form of a computer system 900, within which a set of instructions for causing the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein may be executed. In various example embodiments, the machine operates as a standalone device or may be connected (e.g., networked) to other machines.

The instructions 955 may further be transmitted or received over a network via the network interface device 945 utilizing any one of a number of well-known transfer protocols (e.g., Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)).
