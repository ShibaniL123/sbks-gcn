CD20-BINDING IMMUNOTOXINS FOR INDUCING CELLULAR INTERNALIZATION AND METHODS USING SAME FIELD OF THE INVENTION [1 ] The present invention relates to CD20-binding proteins with the ability of binding to and forcing the rapid internalization of CD20 antigens from a cell surface location to the cell interior. These CD 20-binding proteins have uses as therapeutic molecules for treatment of a variety of diseases, including cancer and immune disorders. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [2] An immunotoxin is a chimeric molecule which combines a cell surface binding region, such as from an immunoglobulin domain, and a toxin region typically derived from a naturally occurring protein toxin, such as those found in bacteria or plants. The potency of an immunotoxin greatly depends on its efficiency in transiting from the cell surface to the cytosol, a process that begins with cell internalization (see Pirie C et al., JBiol Chem 286: 4165-72 (2011)). [3] CD20 is a member of a family of polypeptides known as the membranespanning 4Α (MS4A) family that includes at least 26 proteins in humans and mice (Ishibashi Κ et at., Gene 264: 87-93 (2001)). As with all MS4A members, the CD20 sequence predicts three hydrophobic regions forming a transmembrane molecule that spans the membrane four times, a structural characteristic believed central to its function. Also predicted is a single extracellular loop between the proposed third and fourth transmembrane domains and intracellular amino- and carboxy-terminal regions (Tedder Τ et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci 85: 208-12 (1988)). It is within this extracellular loop of approximately 40 amino acids that the majority of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as rituximab, are believed to bind with alanine-170 and proline-172 being the most critical residues. A crystal structure of an antibody binding a peptide fragment of CD20 using amino acids 163-187 of CD20 has confirmed amino acids 170 (alanine) through amino acids 173 -1 - iDESCPAMDl PCT/US 2014/023 I QO__00-0.1_J.0.1 C (serine) as antigen-antibody interaction points for rituximab and CD20 (Du J et al, J Biol Chem 282: 15073-80 (2007)). [4] CD20 is believed to be present on the cell surface as a homo-multimer, likely a tetraraer, and electron microscopy has shown that 90% ofcomplexed CD20 is present in the membrane in lipid rafts and microvilli (Li Η et al,,J Biol Chem 279: 19893-901 (2004)). Lipid rafts are micro-domains found in the plasma membrane which have high polypeptide, sphingolipid, and cholesterol concentrations (Brown D, London Ε, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 14: 111 -36 (1998)), Microvilli, or microvillar channels, are cell extensions from the plasma membrane surface (Reaven Ε et al., J Lipid Res 30: 1551-60 (1989)). Some antibodies to CD20 are known to bind only when the molecule is present in lipid rafts, such as FMC7 (Polyak Μ et al., Leukemia 17:1384-89 (2003)) and others, such as rituximab, are known to increase association of CD20 to rafts (Li Η et al, supra). It . is hypothesized that raft association is important to the proposed function of CD20 as an amplifier of calcium signals that are transduced through the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR), another protein commonly located within lipid rafts and found associated with CD20 multimers (Polyak Μ et al., J Biol Chem 283: 18545-52 (2008)). [5] Antibody-based therapies targeting a CD20 antigen are numerous (see Boross Ρ, Leusen J, Am J Cancer Res 2: 676-90 (2012), for review). One of the attractive characteristics of CD20 as a target for therapies based on a mechanism in which the therapeutic remains on the cell surface in order to function is the lack of CD20 cellular internalization after being bound by antibody-based therapeutics (Anderson Κ et al., Blood 63: 1424-33 (1984); Press O et al. Blood 69: 584-91 (1987)). Although this has proven to be both cell-type and antibody-type specific, in general, CD20 appears to internalize at a much lower rate than do other cell surface antigens (Beers S et al, Sem Hematol 47: 107-14 (2010)). [6] There is a question in the art as to the utility of CD20 antigens as a target for therapies that require the therapeutic to internalize into a target cell after binding in order to be effective because of the general finding that CD20 does not readily internalize (Anderson Κ et al. Blood 63: 1424-33 (1984); Press O et al. Blood 69: 584-91 (1987); Beers S et al., Sem Hemalol 47: 107-14 (2010)). Thus, there is an unsolved problem in targeting CD20 antigens with immunoglobulin-type therapeutics that require cell internalization for efficacy - how to force the CD20 bound therapeutic into the target cell’s interior after binding. For example, therapies based on the delivery of an immunotoxin that targets a CD20 antigen are predicted to be ineffective based on insufficient CD20 internalization efficiency. Thus, there is a need in the art to develop effective compositions, therapeutics, and therapeutic methods that target cell-surface antigens which do not natively internalize at an efficient rate or upon binding by an immunoglobulin-type domain, like CD20. [7] In particular, there remains a need in the art to identify and develop CD20-targeted compositions that trigger rapid and efficient cellular internalization of the complex of the composition bound to CD20. For example, cytotoxic CD20-binding proteins comprising toxin-derived regions that induce cellular internalization of native CD20 molecules are desirable for the development of effective cancer and immuno-modulatoiy therapeutic molecules that target cells of B-cell lineages. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [8] The present invention provides various CD20-binding proteins for inducing rapid cellular internalization of CD20, which comprise 1) a CD20 binding region, such as an immunoglobulin domain, and 2) a Shiga toxin effector region, such as a truncation of SLT-1 A. Upon binding a CD20 antigen on the surface of a cell, the CD20-binding proteins of the invention are capable of inducing rapid cellular internalization of the complex comprising of the CD20-binding protein and a CD20 antigen into the interior of a eukaryotic cell.

Introduction [52] The present invention solves problems for engineering therapeutics targeting CD20 that require cell internalization for function because Shiga-toxin-Subunit-A derived effector regions induce the cellular internalization of CD20. The present invention provides CD20-binding proteins that bind to extracellular CD20 antigens and rapidly internalize CD20 from a cell membrane location to the interior of a cell. Certain of the disclosed CD20-binding proteins kill cells which express CD20 on their surface. Certain of the disclosed CD20-binding proteins are capable of precisely delivering additional exogenous material in the form of molecular cargos to the interior of cells which express CD20 on their surface. The present invention expands the universe of immunotoxin-drugable targets to include CD20 and enables the precise delivery of payloads to the interiors of CD20 expressing cells. I. The General Structure of the CD20-Binding Proteins of the Invention [53] The present invention provides various CD20-binding proteins for the selective killing of specific cell types, each CD20-binding protein comprising 1) a CD20 binding region comprising immunoglobulin-type binding regions for cell targeting and 2) a Shiga toxin effector region for cell killing. The linking of CD20 targeting immunoglobulin-type binding regions with Shiga-toxin-Subunit-A-derived - 13 - regions enables the engineering of cell-type specific targeting of the potent Shiga toxin cytotoxicity. This system is modular, in that various Shiga toxin effector regions and additional exogenous materials may be linked to the same CD20 binding region to provide diverse applications involving CD20 expressing cells. CD20-binding proteins of the invention comprise Shiga toxin effector regions derived from the A Subunits of members of the Shiga toxin family linked to immunoglobulin-type CD20 binding regions which can bind specifically to at least one extracellular part of a CD20 molecule spanning the outer cell membrane of a eukaryotic cell. This general structure is modular in that various CD20 binding regions can be linked to Shiga-toxin-Subunit-A derived effector regions at various positions or with different linkers between them to produce variations of the same general structure (see e g. Figure 1). A. CD20 Binding Regions Comprising an Immunoglobulin-Tvpe Binding Region [54] For purposes of the present invention, the term “CD20 binding region” refers to a polypeptide region capable of specifically binding an extracellular part of a CD20 molecule. While the name CD20 might refer to multiple proteins with related structures and polypeptide sequences from various species, for the purposes of the present invention the term “CD20” refers to the B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 proteins present in mammals whose exact sequence might vary slightly based on the isoform and from individual to individual. For example, in humans CD20 refers to the protein represented by the predominant polypeptide sequence UnitProt PI 1836 andNCBI accessionΝΡ 690605.1; however, different isoforms and variants may exist. The polypeptide sequence of various CD 20 proteins has been described in various species, such as bats, cats, cattle, dogs, mice, marmosets, and rats, and can be predicted by bioinformatics in numerous other species based on genetic homology (e.g. CD20 has been predicted in various primates, including baboons, macaques, gibbons, chimpanzees, and gorillas) (see Zuccolo J et al., PLoS One 5: ℮9369 (2010) and NCBI protein database (National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S.). A skilled worker will be able to identify a CD20 protein in mammals, even if it differs from the referenced sequences slightly. ;/οτ/2ο;ΐ5 [55] An extracellular part of a CD20 molecule refers to a portion of its structure exposed to the extracellular environment when the CD20 molecule is natively present in a cell membrane. In this context, exposed to the extracellular environment means that part of the CD20 molecule is accessible by, e.g., an antibody or at least a binding moiety smaller than an antibody such as a single-domain antibody domain, a nanobody, a heavy-chain antibody domain derived from camelids or cartilaginous fishes, a single-chain variable fragment, or any number of engineered alternative scaffolds to immunoglobulins (see below). The exposure of a part of CD2.0 may be empirically determined by the skilled worker using methods known in the art. Note that some portion of CD20, which was predicted not to be accessible to an antibody in the extracellular space based on its location within CD20, was empirically shown to be accessible by a monoclonal antibody (Teeling J etal,,J. Immunol, 177: 362-71 (2006)). [56] CD20 binding regions are commonly derived from antibody or antibody-like structures; however, alternative scaffolds from other sources are contemplated within the scope of the term. In certain embodiments, the CD20 binding region is derived from an immunoglobulin-derived binding region, such as an antibody paratope. In certain other embodiments, the CD20 binding region comprises an immunoglobulin-type binding region that is an engineered polypeptide not derived from any immunoglobulin domain. There are numerous immunoglobulin-derived binding regions contemplated as components in the present invention. [57] CD20-binding proteins of the invention comprise an immunoglobulin-type binding region comprising one or more polypeptides capable of selectively and specifically binding an extracellular part of CD20. The term “immunoglobulin-type binding region” as used herein refers to a polypeptide region capable of binding one or more target biomolecules, such as an antigen or epitope. Immunoglobulin-type binding regions are functionally defined by their ability to bind to target molecules, and all the immunoglobulin-type binding regions of the present invention are capable of binding CD20. Immunoglobulin-type binding regions are commonly derived from antibody or antibody-like structures; however, alternative scaffolds from other sources are contemplated within the scope of the term. -15 - 23/01/20.15j DESCPAMDi PCT/US 2014/023 1 q ο op_a,i ?.o.i [58] Immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins have a structural domain known as an Ig domain. Ig domains range in length from about 70-110 amino acid residues and possess a characteristic Ig-fold, in which typically 7 to 9 antiparallel beta strands arrange into two beta sheets which form a sandwich-like structure. The Ig fold is stabilized by hydrophobic amino acid interactions on inner surfaces of the sandwich and highly conserved disulfide bonds between cysteine residues in the strands. Ig domains may be variable (IgV or V-set), constant (IgC or C-set) or intermediate (Igl or I-set). Some Ig domains may be associated with a complementarity determining region (CDR), also referred to as antigen binding region (ABR), which is important for the specificity of antibodies binding to their epitopes. Ig-like domains are also found in non-immunoglobulin proteins and are classified on that basis as members of the Ig superfamily of proteins. The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) provides a list of members of the Ig-like domain containing family. [59] An immunoglobulin-type binding region may be a polypeptide sequence of antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof wherein the amino acid sequence has been varied from that of a native antibody or an Ig-like domain of a non- immunoglobulin protein, for example by molecular engineering or selection by library screening. Because of the relevance of recombinant DNA techniques and in vitro library screening in the generation of immunoglobulin-type binding regions, antibodies can be redesigned to obtain desired characteristics, such as smaller size, cell entry, or other therapeutic improvements. The possible variations are many and may range from the changing of just one amino acid to the complete redesign of, for example, a variable region. Typically, changes in the variable region will be made in order to improve the antigen-binding characteristics, improve variable region stability, or reduce the potential for immunogenic responses. [60] There are numerous immunoglobulin-type binding regions that bind an extracellular part of CD20 contemplated in the present invention. In certain embodiments, the immunoglobulin-type binding region is derived from an immunoglobulin binding region, such as an antibody paratope capable of binding an extracellular part of CD20. In certain other embodiments, the immunoglobulin-type binding region comprises an engineered polypeptide not derived from any immunoglobulin domain but that functions like an immunoglobulin binding region by providing high-affinity binding to an extracellular part of CD20. This engineered polypeptide may optionally include polypeptide scaffolds comprising or consisting essentially of complementary determining regions from immunoglobulins as described herein. [61 ] There are numerous immunoglobulin-derived binding regions and non-immunoglobulin engineered polypeptides in the prior art that are useful for targeting the CD20-binding proteins of the invention to CD20 expressing cells. In certain embodiments, the immunoglobulin-type binding region of the present CD20-binding proteins is selected from the group which includes single-domain antibody domains (sdAb), nanobodies, heavy-chain antibody domains derived from camelids (Vhh fragments), bivalent nanobodies, heavy-chain antibody domains derived from cartilaginous fishes, immunoglobulin new antigen receptors (IgNARs), Vnar fragments, single-chain variable (scFv) fragments, multimerizing scFv fragments (diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies), bispecific tandem scFv fragments, disulfide stabilized antibody variable (Fv) fragments, disulfide stabilized antigen-binding (Fab) fragments consisting of the VL, Vh, Cl and Ch 1 domains, divalent F(ab’)2 fragments, Fd fragments consisting of the heavy chain and ChI domains, single chain Fv-Ch3 minibodies, bispecific minibodies, dimeric .Ch2 domain fragments (Ch2D), Fc antigen binding domains (Fcabs), isolated complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) fragments, constrained framework region 3, CDR3, framework region 4 (FR3-CDR3-FR4) polypeptides, small modular immunopharmaceutical (SMIP) domains, and any genetically manipulated counterparts of the foregoing that retain its paratope and binding function (see, Weiner L, Cell 148: 1081-4 (2012); Ahmad Ζ et al., Clin Dev Immunol 2012: 980250 (2012), for reviews). [62] In accordance with certain other embodiments, the immunoglobulin-type binding region of the CD20-binding proteins of the invention may include engineered, alternative scaffolds to immunoglobulin domains that exhibit similar functional characteristics, such as high-affinity and specific binding to CD20, and enable the engineering of improved characteristics, such as greater stability or reduced immunogenicity. For certain embodiments of the CD20-binding proteins of the invention, the immunoglobulin-type binding region is selected from the group which includes engineered, fibronection-derived, 10th fibronectin type III (lOFn3) domain (monobodies, AdNectins™, or AdNexins™); engineered, tenacsin-derived, tenacsin type III domain (Centryns™); engineered, ankyrin repeat motif containing polypeptide (DARPins™); engineered, low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-derived, A domain (LDLR-A) (Avimers™); lipocalin (anticalins); engineered, protease inhibitor-derived, Kunitz domain; engineered, Protein-A-derived, Ζ domain (AfGbodies™); engineered, gamma-B crystalline-derived scaffold or engineered, ubiquitin-derived scaffold (Affilins); Sac7d-derived polypeptides (Nanoffitins® or affitins); engineered, Fyn-derived, SH2 domain (Fynomers®); and engineered antibody mimic and any genetically manipulated counterparts of the foregoing that retains its binding functionality (Worn A, Pluckthun A,JMol Biol 305: 989-1010 (2001); Xu L et al., Chem Biol 9: 933-42 (2002); Wikman Μ et ah, Protein Eng Des Sel 17: 455-62 (2004); Binz Η et al., Nat Bioteehnol 23: 1257-68 (2005); Holliger Ρ, Hudson Ρ, Nat Bioteehnol 23: 1126-36 (2005); Gill D, Damle Ν, Curr Opin Biotech 17:653-8 (2006); Koide A, Koide S, Methods Mol Biol 352: 95-109 (2007)). [63] Nonlimiting examples of protein constructs encompassed within the term “binding region" as used herein include: (i) an Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH 1 domains; (ii) an F(ab’)2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) an Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH 1 domains; (iv) an Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (ν) a dAb fragment, which consists of a VH domain; and (vi) an isolated CDR. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they may be recombinantly jo ined by a synthetic linker, creating a single protein chain in which the VL and VH domains pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv)). The most commonly used linker is a 15-residue (Gly4Ser)3 peptide, but other linkers are also known in the art. Single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term “binding region” as used herein. [64] It is also anticipated that alternative scaffolds that provide binding function [PESCPAMD) PCT/US 2014/023 I qo οο-θ,ΐ are within the scope of the term “binding region” as used herein. Some examples of the alternative scaffolds include diabodies, a CDR3 peptide, a constrained FR3-CDR3-FR4 peptide, a nanobody (U.S. patent application publication 2008/0107601), a bivalent nano body, small modular immunopharmaceuticals (SMIPs), a shark variable IgNAR domain (WO 03/014161), a minibody and any fragment or chemically or genetically manipulated counterparts that retain target molecule binding function. [65] An “antibody-derived sequence” as used herein, means an amino acid sequence of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof wherein the amino acid sequence has been varied from that of a native antibody. Because of the relevance of recombinant DNA techniques in the generation of antibodies, antibodies can be redesigned to obtain desired characteristics. The possible variations are many and range from the changing of just one or a few amino acids to the complete redesign of, for example, a variable region. Typically, changes in the variable region will be made in order to improve the antigen-binding characteristics, improve variable region stability, or reduce the risk of immunogenicity. [66] As used herein, the term “heavy chain variable (VH) domain" or “light chain variable (VL) domain” respectively refer to any native antibody VH or VL domain (e.g., a human VH or VL domain) as well as any derivative thereof retaining at least qualitative antigen binding ability of the corresponding native antibody (e.g., a humanized VH or VL domain derived from a native murine VH or VL domain). A VH or VL domain consists of a “framework” region interrupted by the three CDRs. The framework regions serve to align the CDRs for specific binding to an epitope of an antigen. From amino-terminus to carboxyl-terminus, both VH and VL domains comprise the following framework (FR) and CDR regions: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Rabat, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (5 th ed., National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 1991), or Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196: 901 -17 (1987); Chothia et al., Nature 342:878-83, (1989). CDRs 1,2, and 3 of a VH domain are also referred to herein, respectively, as HCDR1, HCDR2, and HCDR3; CDRs 1,2, and 3 of a VL domain are also referred to herein, respectively, 23/01/20151 IDESCPAMD' PCT/US 2014/023 19 oLr\-1 η η ,ΐ IUS2014023198 as LCDR1, LCDR2, and LCDR3. [67] In some embodiments of the CD20-binding proteins of the present invention, the binding region comprises an antibody or an antibody-derived sequence that comprises a specific set of complementarity determining regions, or CDRs. CDRs are defined sequence regions within the variable domains of antibodies that are necessary for specific binding of the antibody to its antigenic determinants. In one embodiment of the invention, the set of CDRs comprise three CDRs derived from the heavy chain of the antibody and three CDRs derived from light chain of the antibody. In some embodiments, the three heavy chain CDRs comprise: (a) a heavy chain variable domain comprising HCDR1, HCDR2, and HCDR3 amino acid sequences as shown in SEQ ID ΝΟ:6, SEQ ID ΝΟ:7, and SEQ ID ΝΟ:8, respectively, and a light chain variable domain comprising LCDRl, LCDR2, and LCDR3 amino acid sequences as shown in SEQ ID ΝΟ:9, SEQ ID NO: 10, and SEQ ID NO: 11, respectively; (b) a heavy chain variable domain comprising HCDR1, HCDR2, and HCDR3 amino acid sequences as shown in SEQ ID ΝΟ:21, SEQ ID ΝΟ:22, and SEQ ID ΝΟ:23, respectively, and alight chain variable domain comprising LCDRl, LCDR2, and LCDR3 amino acid sequences as shown in SEQ ID ΝΟ:24, SEQ ID ΝΟ:10, and SEQ ID ΝΟ:11, respectively; or (c) a heavy chain variable (VH) domain comprising HCDR1, HCDR2, and HCDR3 amino acid sequences as shown in SEQ ID ΝΟ:21, SEQ ID ΝΟ:22, and SEQ ID ΝΟ:27, respectively, and a light chain variable (VL) domain comprising LCDRl, LCDR2, and LCDR3 amino acid sequences as shown in SEQ ID ΝΟ:28, SEQ ID NO: 10, and SEQ ID ΝΟ:29, respectively. Additionally, in certain embodiments of the invention, the binding region comprises or consists essentially ο f amino acids 2 to 245 of SEQ ID ΝΟ:4. [68] This system is modular, in that various, diverse immunoglobulin-type binding regions can be used with the same Shiga toxin effector region to target different extracellular epitopes of CD20. It will be appreciated by the skilled worker that any CD20 binding region of an immunoglobulin type capable of binding an extracellular part of CD20 may be used to design or select an immunoglobulin-23/01 /2015j iDESCPAMDi PCT/US 2014/023 19 ο oojm r>o,i ς type binding region to be linked to the Shiga toxin effector region to produce a CD20-binding protein of the invention. Β. Shiga Toxin Effector Reeions Derived from A Subunits of Members of the Shiga Toxin Family [69] For purposes of the.present invention, the phrase “Shiga toxin effector region” refers to a polypeptide region derived from a Shiga toxin A Subunit of a member of the Shiga toxin family that is capable of inactivating ribosomes and effectuating cytotoxicity and/or cytostatic effects. A member of the Shiga toxin family refers to any member of a family of naturally occurring protein toxins which are structurally and functionally related, notably toxins isolated from S. dysenteriae an dE. coli (Johannes, Nat Rev Microbiol 8: 105-16 (2010)). For example, the Shiga toxin family encompasses true Shiga toxin (Stx) isolated from S. dysenteriae serotype 1, Shiga-like toxin 1 variants (SLT1 or Stxl or SLT-1 or Slt-I) isolated from serotypes of enterohemorrhagic Ε. coli, and Shiga-like toxin 2 variants (SLT2 or Stx2 or SLT-2) isolated from serotypes of enterohemorrhagic Ε. coli. SLT1 differs by only one residue from Stx, and both have been referred to as Verocytotoxins or Verotoxins (VTs) (O’Brien, Curr Top Microbiol Immunol 180: 65-94 (1992)). Although SLT1 and SLT2 variants are only about 53-60% similar to each other at the amino acid sequence level, they share mechanisms of enzymatic activity and cytotoxicity common to the members of the Shiga toxin family (Johannes, Nat Rev Microbiol 8: 105-16 (2010)). Over 39 different Shiga toxins have been described, such as the defined subtypes Stxla, Stxlc, Stxld, and Stx2a-g (Scheutz F et al., J Clin Microbiol 50: 2951 -63 (2012)). Members of the Shiga toxin family are not naturally restricted to any bacterial species because Shiga- toxin-encoding genes can spread among bacterial species via horizontal gene transfer (Strauch Ε et al., Infect Immun 69: 7588-95 (2001); Zhaxybayeva O, Doolittle W, Curr Biol. 21: R242-6 (2011)). As an example of interspecies transfer, a Shiga toxin was discovered in a strain of A. haemolyticus isolated from a patient (Grotiuz G et al., J Clin Microbiol 44: 3838-41 (2006)). Once a Shiga toxin encoding polynucleotide enters a new subspecies or species, the Shiga toxin amino 23/01/2015] DESCPAMDl PCT/US 2014/023 ΐ qp oo_o-i- acid sequence is presumed to be capable of developing slight sequence variations due to genetic drift and/or selective pressure while still maintaining a mechanism of cytotoxicity common to members of the Shiga toxin family (see Scheutz, J Clin Microbiol 50: 2951-63 (2012)). [70] Shiga toxin effector regions of the invention comprise or consist essentially of a polypeptide derived from a Shiga toxin A Subunit dissociated from any form of its native Shiga toxin Β Subunit. In addition, the CD20-binding proteins of the present invention do not comprise any polypeptide comprising or consisting essentially of a fimctional binding domain of a Shiga toxin Β subunit. Rather, the Shiga toxin A Subunit derived regions are functionally associated with heterologous CD20 binding regions to effectuate cell targeting to CD20 expressing cells. [71 ] In certain embodiments, a Shiga toxin effector region of the invention may comprise or consist essentially of a full length Shiga toxin A Subunit (e.g. SLT-1A (SEQ ID ΝΟ:1), StxA (SEQ ID ΝΟ:25), or SLT-2A (SEQ ID ΝΟ:26)), noting that naturally occurring Shiga toxin A Subunits may comprise precursor forms containing signal sequences of about 22 amino acids at their amino-terminals which are removed to produce mature Shiga toxin A Subunits. One specific example of a “toxin effector region” is one that is derived from the A chain of Shiga-like toxin 1 (SLT-1) (SEQ ID ΝΟ:1). The A chain of SLT-1 is composed of293 amino acids with the enzymatic (toxic) domain spanning residues 1 to 239. In other embodiments, the Shiga toxin effector region of the invention comprises or consists essentially of a truncated Shiga toxin A Subunit which is shorter than a full-length Shiga toxin A Subunit. [72] Shiga-like toxin 1 A Subunit truncations are catalytically active, capable of enzymatically inactivating ribosomes in vitro, and cytotoxic when expressed within a cell (LaPointe, J Biol Chem 280: 23310-18 (2005)). The smallest Shiga toxin A Subunit fragment exhibiting full enzymatic activity is a polypeptide composed of residues 1-239 of Sit! A (LaPointe, J Biol Chem 280: 23310-18 (2005)). Although the smallest fragment of the Shiga toxin A Subunit reported to retain substantial catalytic activity was residues 75-247 of StxA (Al-Jaufy, Infect Immun 62: 956-60 (1994)), a StxA truncation expressed de novo within a eukaryotic cell requires only descpamd; PCT/US 2014/023 1 qo οο noj up to residue 240 to reach the cytosol and exert catalytic inactivation of ribosomes (LaPointe, JBiol Chem 280: 23310-18 (2005)). [73] Shiga toxin effector regions may commonly be smaller than the full length A subunit. It is preferred that the Shiga toxin effector region maintain the polypeptide region from amino acid position 77 to 239 (SLT-1A (SEQ ID MO: 1), StxA (SEQ ID ΝΟ:25), or SLT-2 A (SEQ ID ΝΟ:26)) or the equivalent in other A Subunits of members of the Shiga toxin family. For example, in certain embodiments of the invention, a Shiga toxin effector region derived from SLT-1A may comprise or consist essentially of amino acids 75 to 251 of SEQ 1DN0:1, 1 to 241 of SEQ ID NO: I, 1 to 251 of SEQ ID NO: 1, or amino acids 1 to 261 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Similarly, among certain other embodiments, the Shiga toxin effector regions derived from StxA may comprise or consist essentially of amino acids 75 to 251 of SEQ ID ΝΟ:25, 1 to 241 of SEQ ID ΝΟ:25, 1 to 251 of SEQ ID ΝΟ:25, or amino acids 1 to 261 of SEQ ID ΝΟ:25. Additionally, among certain other embodiments, the Shiga toxin effector regions derived from SLT-2 may comprise or consist essentially of amino acids 75 to 251 of SEQ ID ΝΟ:26,1 to 241 of SEQ ID ΝΟ:26, 1 to 251 of SEQ ID ΝΟ:26, or amino acids 1 to 261 of SEQ IDNO:26. [74] The invention further provides variants of the CD20-binding proteins of the invention, wherein the Shiga toxin effector region differs from a naturally occurring Shiga toxin A Subunit by up to 1,2, 3, 4, 5,6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35,40 or more amino acid residues (but by no more than that which retains at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more amino acid sequence identity). Thus, a polypeptide region derived from an A Subunit of a member of the Shiga toxin family may comprise additions, deletions, truncations, or other alterations from the original sequence so long as at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more amino acid sequence identity is maintained to a naturally occurring Shiga toxin A Subunit. [75] Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the Shiga toxin effector region comprises or consists essentially of amino acid sequences having at least 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5% or 99.7% overall sequence identity to a naturally occurring Shiga toxin A Subunit, such as SLT-1 A (SEQ ID ΝΟ:1), Stx (SEQ ID ΝΟ:25), and/or SLT-2A (SEQ ID ΝΟ:26). [76] Optionally, either a foil length or a truncated version of the Shiga toxin A Subunit may comprise one or more mutations (e.g. substitutions, deletions, insertions or inversions). In certain embodiments that are potently cytotoxic, the Shiga toxin effector region has sufficient sequence identity to retain cytotoxicity after entry into a cell, either by well-known methods of host cell transformation, transfection, infection or induction, or by internalization mediated by the cell targeting, immunoglobulin-type binding region linked with the Shiga toxin effector region. The most critical residues for enzymatic activity and/or cytotoxicity in the Shiga toxin A Subunits have been mapped to the following residue-positions: aspargine-75, tyrosine-77, glutamate-167, arginine-170, and arginine-176 among others (Di, Toxicon 57: 535-39 (2011)). In any one of the embodiments of the present invention, the Shiga toxin effector region may preferably but not necessarily maintain one or more conserved amino acids at positions, such as those found at positions 77, 167, 170, and 203 in StxA, SLT-1A, or the equivalent conserved position in other members of the Shiga toxin family which are typically required for cytotoxic activity. The capacity of a CD20-binding protein of the invention to cause cell death, e.g. its cytotoxicity, may be measured using any one or more of a number of assays well known in the art. [77] In certain embodiments of the invention, one or more amino acid residues may be mutated or deleted in order to reduce or eliminate cytotoxic activity of the Shiga toxin effector region. The cytotoxicity of the A Subunits of members of the Shiga toxin family may be reduced or eliminated by mutation or truncation. The positions labeled tyrosine-77, glutamate-167, arginine-170, tyrosine-114, and tryptophan-203 have been shown to be important for the catalytic activity of Stx, Stxl, and Stx2 (Hovde C et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 85: 2568-72 (1988); Deresiewicz R et al., Biochemistry 31: 3272-80 (1992); Deresiewicz R et al., Mol Gen Genet 241:467-73 (1993); Ohmura Μ et al., Microb Paihog 15:169-76 (1993); Cao C et al., Microbiol Immunol 38: 441-7 (1994); Suhan Μ, Hovde C, Infect Immun 66: 5252-9 (1998)). Mutating both glutamate-167 and arginine-170 eliminated the enzymatic activity of Slt-I Al in a cell-free ribosome inactivation assay (LaPointe, JBiol Chem 280: 23310-18 (2005)). In another approach using de novo expression of Slt-I Α1 in the endoplasmic reticulum, mutating both glutamate-167 and arginine-170 eliminated Slt-I Α1 fragment cytotoxicity at that expression level (LaPoints,J Biol Chem 280: 23310-18 (2005)). A truncation analysis demonstrated that a fragment of StxA from residues 75 to 268 still retains significant enzymatic activity in vitro (Haddad, JBacteriol 175: 4970-8 (1993)). A truncated fragment of Slt-I Α1 containing residues 1-239 displayed significant enzymatic activity in vitro and cytotoxicity by de novo expression in the cytosol (LaPointe, J Biol Chem 280: 23310-18 (2005)). Expression of a Slt-I Α1 fragment truncated to residues I-239 in the endoplasmic reticulum was not cytotoxic because it could not retrotranslocate into the cytosol (LaPointe, J Biol Chem 280: 23310-18 (2005)). [78] For the purposes of the present invention, the specific order or orientation is not fixed for the Shiga toxin effector region and the CD20 binding region in relation to each other or the entire CD20-binding protein’s N-terminal(s) and C-terminal(s). (see e.g. Figure 1). In the above CD20-binding proteins, the CD20 binding regions and Shiga toxin effector regions may be directly linked to each other and/or suitably linked to each other via one or more intervening polypeptide sequences, such as with one or more linkers well known in the art. II. Examples of Specific Structural Variations of the CD20-Binding Proteins of the Invention [79] Among certain embodiments of the present invention, the CD20-binding proteins comprise the Shiga toxin effector region comprising or consisting essentially of amino acids 75 to 251 of SLT-1A (SEQ ID ΝΟ:1), StxA (SEQ ID ΝΟ:25), or SLT-2A(SEQ ID ΝΟ:26). Further embodiments are CD20-binding proteins in which the Shiga toxin effector region comprises or consists essentially of amino acids 1 to 241 of SLT-1 A (SEQ ID ΝΟ:1), StxA (SEQ ID ΝΟ:25), and/or SLT-2A (SEQ ID ΝΟ:26). Further embodiments are CD20-binding proteins in which the Shiga toxin effector region comprises or consists essentially of amino acids 1 to 251 ofSLT-lA(SEQ ID ΝΟ:1), StxA (SEQ Π)ΝΟ:25), and/or SLT-2A (SEQ ID ΝΟ:26). Further embodiments are CD20-binding proteins in which the Shiga toxin effector region comprises or consists essentially of amino acids 1 to 261 of SLT-1A (SEQ ID NO: 1), StxA (SEQ ID ΝΟ:25), and/or SLT-2A (SEQ ID ΝΟ:26). [80] For certain embodiments, the CD20-binding proteins of the present invention is one which comprises or consists essentially of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID ΝΟ;4, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID Ν0:14, or SEQ ID NO: 16. [81] As used herein^ the term “heavy chain variable (VH) domain” or “light chain variable (Vl) domain” respectively refer to any antibody Vh or Vl domain (e.g. a human Vh or Vl domain) as well as any derivative thereof retaining at least qual itative antigen binding ability of the corresponding native antibody (e.g. a humanized Vh or Vl domain derived from a native murine Vh or Vl domain). AVH or Vl domain consists of a “framework” region interrupted by the three CDRs. The framework regions serve to align the CDRs for specific binding to an epitope of an antigen. From amino-terminus to carboxyl-terminus, both Vh and Vl domains comprise the following framework (FR) and CDR regions: FRI, CDRI, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kunik V et al., PLoS Comput Biol 8: e 1002388 (2012) and Kunik V et al., Nucleic Acids Res 40: W521-4 (2012) or alternatively in accordance with the definitions of Kabat, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, (5th ed., National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 1991); or Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196: 901-17 (1987); Chothia et al., Nature 342: 878-83 (1989). [82] In certain embodiments of the invention, the CDRs comprise three CDRs derived from a heavy chain of the antibody and three CDRs derived from a light chain of the antibody. In certain embodiments, the three heavy chain CDRs comprise SEQ ID NO: 7 (HCDR1), SEQ ID ΝΟ:8 (HCDR2), and SEQ ID Ν0:9 (HCR3), while the three light chain CDRs comprise SEQ ID ΝΟ:9 (LCDR1), SEQ ID NO: 10 (LCDR2) and SEQ ID NO: 11 (LCDR3). Additionally, in certain embodiments of the invention, the immunoglobulin-type binding region comprises or consists essentially of amino acids 2 to 245 of SEQ ID NO: 4. [83] It is within the scope of the invention to use fragments, variants, and/or derivatives of the polypeptides of the CD20-binding proteins of the invention which contain a functional CD20 binding site to any extracellular part of CD20, and even more preferably capable of binding CD20 with high affinity (e.g. as shown by IQ>). For example, the invention provides immunoglobulin-derived polypeptide sequences that can bind to CD20. Any polypeptide may be substituted for this region which binds an extracellular part of CD20 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 10‘5 to 10‘J2 moles/liter, preferably less than 200 ηΜ. [84] Thus it is within the scope of the invention to alter the immunoglobulin-type binding site of a disclosed exemplary CD20-binding protein so long as at least one polypeptide sequence is chosen from the group consisting of the CDR1 sequences, CDR2 sequences, and CDR3 sequences that are described. In particular, but without limitation, the polypeptide sequences of the invention may consist essentially of 4 framework regions (FR1 to FR4) and three complementary determining regions (CDR1 to CDR3 respectively); or any suitable fragment of such amino acid sequence that exhibits target biomolecule binding functionality based on the presence of one or more CDRs. [85] In certain embodiments, the immunoglobulin-type binding region comprises (i) a heavy chain variable (VH) domain comprising CDR amino acid sequences as shown in SEQ ID ΝΟ:6, SEQ ID ΝΟ:7, and SEQ ID ΝΟ:8, and (ϋ) a light chain variable (VL) domain comprising CDR amino acid sequences as shown in SEQ ID ΝΟ:9, SEQ ID NO: 10, and SEQ ID NO: 11. In other embodiments, the immunoglobulin-type binding region comprises or consists essentially of amino acids 2 to 245 of SEQ ID ΝΟ:4. [86] Among certain embodiments of the present invention, the immunoglobulin-type binding region is derived from a nanobody or single domain immunoglobulin-derived region Vhh which exhibits high affinity binding specifically to CD20. Generally, nanobodies are constructed from fragments of naturally occurring singl e, monomeric variable domain antibodies (sdAbs) of the sort found in camelids and cartilaginous fishes (Chondrichthyes). Nanobodies are engineered from these naturally occurring antibodies by truncating the single, monomeric variable domain 23/01/2015 iDESGPAMDl PCT/US 2014/023 ΐ Q ο ο o_o i ΐ ς xiUS2014023198ΐ to create a smaller and more stable molecule. Due to their small size, nanobodies are able to bind to antigens that are not accessible to whole antibodies. III. The General Function of the CD20-Bindine Proteins of the Invention [87] The present invention provides various CD20-binding proteins for the selective killing of specific cell types, the CD20 proteins comprising 1) immunoglobulin-type CD20 binding regions for cell targeting and 2) cytotoxic Shiga toxin effector regions for inducing cellular internalization arid, optionally, cell killing as well. The linking of CD20 targeting immunoglobulin-type binding regions with Shiga-toxin-Subunit-A-derived regions enables the targeting of the potent Shiga toxin cytotoxicity specifically to CD20 expressing cells. In their preferred embodiments, the CD20-binding proteins of the invention are capable of binding CD20 natively present on a cell surface and entering the cell. Once internalized within a targeted cell type, certain embodiments of the CD20-binding proteins of the invention are capable of routing a cytotoxic Shiga toxin effector polypeptide fragment into the cytosol of the target cell. Once in the cytosol of a targeted cell type, certain embodiments of the CD20-binding proteins of the invention are capable of enzymatically inactivating ribosomes and eventually killing the cell. Alternatively, non-toxic variants may be used to deliver additional exogenous materials and/or label the interiors of CD20 expressing cells for diagnostic purposes. [88] Various types of cells which express CD20 may be targeted by the CD20-binding proteins of the invention for killing and/or receiving exogenous materials. Among the CD20 expressing cell types anticipated to internalize the CD20-binding proteins of the invention are those within the B-cell lineage. “B-cell lineage” is a term used to describe those cells that are cytologically or otherwise identified as B-cells themselves, e.g., through cell surface markers, or were once or presently derived from cells that are cytologically or otherwise identified as B-cells. The term “B-cell lineage” includes neoplastic cells derived from the B-cell lineage " or precursors to the B-cell lineage. Among the CD20 expressing cell types that may be targeted are dysplastic or neoplastic cells of cell lineages which do not normally express CD20, e.g. melanoma cells. In particular, the CD20 expressing cells to be targeted with the CD20-binding proteins of the invention include neoplastic cells of B-cell lineages or non-B-cell lineages, such as neoplastic cells from a hematopoietic lineage that are not usually categorized as B-cells but which express CD20. A. CD20-Binding Protein Capable of Inducing Rapid Internalization of CD20 [89] The Shiga toxin effector regions of the present invention provide an internalization function, moving the CD20-binding proteins from the external surface of the target cell into the cytosol of the target cell. However, this internalization function is also an acceleration function in that the cellular internalization of CD20 is promoted or induced. As used in the specification and the claims herein, the phrase “rapid internalization” refers to a CD20-binding protein of the invention decreasing the time for CD20 cellular internalization upon binding as compared to a prior art reference molecule, such as the monoclonal antibody rituximab. [90] For the purposes of the present invention, cellular internalization is considered rapid if the time for internalization to occur due to the binding of the CD20-binding proteins is reduced as compared to the time for internalization of the target molecule with the binding of a well-characterized antibody recognizing a CD20 antigen, such as the 1Η4 CD20 monoclonal antibody (Haisma Η et al., Blood 92: 184-90 (1999)). For example, internalization timing for the CD20 antigen, although variable for cell type and antibody type, does not typically begin to reach maxima] levels until approximately six hours after binding. Thus the term “rapid” as defined within the present specification is less than this six hour standard internalization window. In certain embodiments, rapid can be as quickly as less than about one hour, but can also encompass a range of from about 1 hour to about 2 hours, to about 3 hours, to about 4 hours, to about 5 hours; a range of about 2 hours to about 3 hours, to about 4 hours, to about 5 hours; a range of about 3 hours to about 4 hours, to about 5 hours; and a range of about 4 hours to about 5 hours. Β. Cell Kill via Targeted Shiga Toxin Cytotoxicity [91 ] Because members of the Shiga toxin family are adapted to killing eukaryotic cells, CD20-binding proteins designed using Shiga toxin effector regions can show potent cell-kill activity. The A Subunits of members of the Shiga toxin family comprise enzymatic domains capable of killing a eukaryotic cell once in the cell’s cytosol. Certain embodiments of the CD20-binding proteins of the invention take advantage of this cytotoxic mechanism. [92] In certain embodiments of the CD20-binding proteins of the invention, upon contacting a cell expressing CD20 such that at least a part of CD20 is accessible from the extracellular space, the CD20-binding protein is capable of causing death of the cell. CD20 positive “cell kill” may be accomplished using a CD20-binding protein of the invention under varied conditions of target cells, such as an ex vivo manipulated target cell, a target cell cultured in vitro, a. target cell within a tissue sample cultured in vitro, or a target cell in vivo. C. Selective Cytotoxicity between CD20 Expressing Cells and Non-CD20 Expressing Cells [93] By targeting the delivery of enzymatically active Shiga toxin regions using high-affinity immunoglobulin-type binding regions to CD20 expressing cells, this potent cell-kill activity can be restricted to preferentially killing CD20 positive cell types. [94] In certain embodiments, upon administration of the CD20-binding protein of the invention to a mixture of cell types, the CD20-binding protein is capable of selectively killing CD20 expressing cells displaying an extracellular CD20 target compared to cell types lacking extracellular CD20 targets. Because members of the Shiga toxin family are adapted for killing eukaryotic cells, CD20-binding proteins designed using Shiga toxin effector regions can show potent cytotoxic activity. By targeting the delivery of enzymatically active Shiga toxin regions to CD20 expressing cells using high-affinity immunoglobulin-type binding regions, this potent cell kill activity can be restricted to preferentially killing only CD20 expressing cells. [95] In certain embodiments, the CD20-binding protein of the invention is capable of selectively or preferentially causing the death of a specific cell type within a mixture of two or more different cell types. This enables targeting cytotoxic activity to specific cell types with a high preferentiality, such as with at least a 3-fold cytotoxic effect, over “bystander” cell types that do not express any significant amount of extracellular CD20 targets. This enables the targeted cell-killing of specific cell types expressing CD20 on cellular surfaces with a high preferentiality, such as with at least a 3-fold cytotoxic effect, over “bystander” cell types that do not express significant amounts of CD20 or are not exposing significant amounts of CD20 on a cellular surface. [96] In certain further embodiments, upon administration of the CD20-binding protein to two different populations of cell types, the CD20-binding protein is capable of causing cell death as defined by the half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CD50) on a cell population which expresses CD20 on a cellular surface at a dose at least three times lower than the CDso dose of the same CD20-binding protein to a cell population which does not express CD20. [97] In certain embodiments, the cytotoxic activity toward populations of cell types expressing CD20 on a cellular surface is at least 3-fold higher than the cytotoxic activity toward populations of cell types not physically coupled with any extracellular CD20 target of the CD20 binding region of the embodiment. According to the present invention, selective cytotoxicity may be quantified in terms of the ratio (a/b) of (a) cytotoxicity towards a population of cells expressing an extracellular CD20 target of the CD20 binding region of the embodiment to (b) cytotoxicity towards a population of cells of a cell type not physically coupled with any extracellular CD20 target of the CD20 binding region of the embodiment. In certain embodiments, the cytotoxicity ratio is indicative of selective cytotoxicity which is at least 3-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 20-fold, 25-fold, 30-fold, 40-fold, 50-fold, 75-fold, 100-fold, 250-fold, 500-fold, 750-fold, or 1000-fold higher for populations of cells or cell types expressing CD20 compared to populations of cells or cell types which do not express CD20. [98] This preferential cell-killing function allows a targeted cell to be killed by certain CD20-binding proteins of the invention under varied conditions and in the presence of non-targeted bystander cells, such as ex vivo manipulated mixtures of . cell types, in vitro cultured tissues with mixtures of cell types, or in vivo in the presence of multiple cell types (e.g. in situ or in its. native location within a multicellular organism). [99] In addition, catalytically inactive forms of CD20-binding proteins optionally may be used for diagnostic functions. The conjugating of additional diagnostic agents known in the art to CD20-binding proteins of the invention enable the imaging of intracellular organelles (e.g. Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytosolic compartments) of individual immune cells of the B-cell lineage or cancer cells in a patient or biopsy sample. For example, this may be useful in the diagnosis of neoplastic cell types, assaying the progression of anticancer therapies over time, and/or evaluating the presence of residual cancer cells after surgical excision of a · tumor mass. ■ . D. Delivery of Additional Exogenous Material [ 100] Because the CD20-binding protein are capable of inducing cellular internalization of CD20 after binding to an extracellular part of GD20, certain embodiments of the CD20-binding proteins of the invention may be used to deliver additional exogenous materials into the interior of CD20 expressing cells. In one sense, the entire CD20-binding protein is an exogenous material which will enter the cell; thus, the “additional” exogenous materials are materials linked to but other than the core CD20-binding protein itself. [101] “Additional exogenous material” as used herein refers to one or more molecules, often not generally present within a native target cell, where the CD20-binding proteins of the present invention can be used to specifically transport such material to the interior of a cell. In general, additional exogenous material is selected from peptides, polypeptides, proteins, and polynucleotides. One example of an additional exogenous material that is a peptide is an influenza virus antigen, such as the influenza Matrix 58-66 peptide (SEQ ID ΝΟ:3). One exemplary embodiment of a CD20-binding protein that may deliver that antigen into a target cell that expresses CD20 is provided in SEQ ID NO: 16. [ 102] Additional exogenous material may include an interior polypeptide sequence within the core CD20-binding protein structure, such as the influenza Matrix 58-66 peptide (SEQ ID ΝΟ:3). Similarly, additional exogenous material may include a terminally-located polypeptide sequence linked to a terminal of the CD20-binding structure. Certain embodiments of the CD20-binding proteins of the invention that may deliver that antigen, as an additional exogenous material, into a target cell that expresses CD20 on a cell surface is the CD20-binding protein that comprises or consists essentially of SEQ ID ΝΟ:4, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 14, or SEQ ID NO: 16. [103] Additional examples of exogenous materials that may be linked to the CD20-binding proteins of the invention include antigens such as those derived from bacterial proteins, such as those characteristic of antigen-presenting cells infected by bacteria. Further examples of additional exogenous materials are proteins mutated in cancer or proteins that are aberrantly expressed in cancer. Further examples of additional exogenous materials include T-cell complementary determining, regions capable of functioning as exogenous antigens. [ 104] Further examples of exogenous materials that may be linked to the CD20-binding proteins of the invention include proteins other than antigens, such as enzymes. Further types of exogenous material are polynucleotides. Among the polynucleotides that can be transported are those formulated to have regulatory function, such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). [105] Additional examples of exogenous materials include antigens such as those derived from bacterial proteins, such as those characteristic of antigen- presenting cells that are infected with bacteria. Further examples of exogenous antigens are ones that are derived from a protein mutated in cancer or proteins that are aberrantly expressed in cancer. T-cell complementary determining regions (CDR) can also act as exogenous antigens for the purposes of the present invention. Additional examples of exogenous material includes proteins other than antigens, such as enzymes. A further type of exogenous material is nucleic acids. Among the nucleic acids that can be transported are those formulated to have regulatory function, such as small ■ interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). Variations in the Polypeptide Sequence of the CD20-Binding Proteins of the Invention which Maintain Overall Structure and Function [ 106] In certain of the above embodiments, the CD20-binding protein of the invention is a variant in which there are one or more conservative amino acid substitutions introduced into the polypeptide region(s). As used herein, the term “conservative substitution” denotes that one or more amino acids are replaced by another, biologically similar amino acid residue. Examples include substitution of amino acid residues with similar characteristics, e.g. small amino acids, acidic amino acids, polar amino acids, basic amino acids, hydrophobic amino acids and aromatic amino acids (see, for example, Table Β below). An example of a conservative substitution with a residue normally not found in endogenous, mammalian peptides and proteins is the conservative substitution of an arginine or lysine residue with, for example, ornithine, canavanine, aminoethylcysteine, or another basic amino acid. For further information concerning phenotypically silent substitutions in peptides and proteins (see e.g. Bowie J et al., Science 247: 1306-10 (1990)). In the scheme below are conservative substitutions of amino acids grouped by physicochemical properties. I: neutral, hydrophilic, II: acids and amides, III: basic, IV: hydrophobic, V: aromatic, bulky amino acids. TABLE Β. Examples of Conservative Amino Acid Substitutions I II in IV V A Ν Η Μ F S D R L Υ Τ Ε Κ I w Ρ Q V G c [107] In certain embodiments, a CD20-binding protein of the invention may comprise functional fragments or variants of a polypeptide region of the invention that have, at most, 20,15,10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5,4, 3, 2, or 1 amino acid substitutions compared to a polypeptide sequence recited herein, as long as it retains measurable biological activity alone or as a component of a CD20-binding protein, Variants of CD20-binding proteins are within the scope of the invention as a result of changing a polypeptide of the CD20-binding protein by altering one or more amino acids or deleting or inserting one or more amino acids, such as within the immunoglobulin-type binding region or the Shiga toxin effector region, in order to achieve desired properties, such as changed cytotoxicity, changed cytostatic effects, changed immunogenicity, and/or changed serum half-life. A polypeptide of a CD20-binding protein of the invention may further be with or without a signal sequence. [108] In certain embodiments, a CD20-binding protein of the invention shares at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more amino acid sequence identity to any one of the amino acid sequences of a CD20-binding protein recited herein, as long as it retains measurable biological activity, such as cytotoxicity, extracellular target biomolecule binding, enzymatic catalysis, or subcellular routing. The immunoglobulin-type binding region may differ from the amino acid sequences of a CD20-binding protein recited herein, as long as it retains binding functionality to its extracellular target biomolecule. Binding functionality will most likely be retained if the amino acid sequences of the ABRs are identical. For example, a CD20-binding protein that consists essentially of 85% amino acid identity to SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 16 in which for the purposes of determining the degree of amino acid identity, the amino acid residues that form the ABR are disregarded. Binding functionality can be determined by the skilled worker using standard techniques. [109] In certain embodiments, the Shiga toxin effector region may be altered to change the enzymatic activity and/or cytotoxicity of the Shiga toxin effector region. This change may or may not result in a change in the cytotoxicity of a CD20-binding protein of which the altered Shiga toxin effector region is a component. Possible alterations include mutations to the Shiga toxin effector region selected from the group consisting of: a truncation, deletion, inversion, insertion and substitution. [110] The cytotoxicity of the A Subunits of members of the Shiga toxin family may be reduced or eliminated by mutation or truncation. The positions labeled tyrosine-77, glutamate-167, arginine-170, tyrosine-114, and tryptophan-203 have PCT/US 2014/023 19 ft, r\r% been shown to be important for the catalytic activity of Stx, Stxl, and Stx2 (Hovde C et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 85: 2568-72 (1988); Deresiewicz R et al., Biochemistry 31: 3272-80 (1992); Deresiewicz R et εΛ.,Μοℓ Gen Genet 241: 467-73 (1993); Ohmura Μ et al., Microb Pathog 15: 169-76 (1993); Cao C et al., Microbiol Immunol38: 441-7 (1994); Suhan Μ, Hovde C, Infect Immun 66: 5252-9 (1998)). Mutating both glutamate-167 and arginine-170 eliminated the enzymatic activity of Slt-I Al in a cell-free ribosome inactivation assay (LaPointe, JBiol Chem 280: 23310-18 (2005)). In another approach using de novo expression of Slt-I Al in the endoplasmic reticulum, mutating both glutamate-167 and arginine-170 eliminated Slt-I Al fragment cytotoxicity at that expression level (LaPointe, J Biol Chem 280: 23310-18 (2005)). A truncation analysis demonstrated that a fragment of StxA from residues 75 to 268 still retains significant enzymatic activity in vitro (Haddad, J Bacteriol 175: 4970-8 (1993)). A truncated fragment of Slt-I Al containing residues 1-239 displayed significant enzymatic activity in vitro and cytotoxicity by de novo expression in the cytosol (LaPointe, J Biol Chem 280: 23310-18 (2005)). Expression of a Slt-1 Al fragment truncated to residues 1-239 in the endoplasmic reticulum was not cytotoxic because it could not retrotranslocate to the cytosol (LaPointe, J Biol Chem 280: 23310-18 (2005)). [111] The most critical residues for enzymatic activity and/or cytotoxicity in the Shiga toxin A Subunits were mapped to the following residue-positions: aspargine-75, tyrosine-77, glutamate-167, arginine-170, and arginine-176 among others (Di, Toxicon 57: 535-39 (2011)). In particular, a double-mutant construct of Stx2A containing glutamate-E167-to-lysine and arginine-176-to-lysine mutations was completely inactivated; whereas, many single mutations in Stxl and Stx2 showed a 10-fold reduction in cytotoxicity. Further, truncation of Stxl A to 1 -239 or 1 -240 reduced its cytotoxicity, and similarly, truncation of Stx2A to a conserved hydrophobic residue reduced its cytotoxicity. [112] Shiga-like toxin 1 A Subunit truncations are catalytically active, capable of enzymatically inactivating ribosomes in vitro, and cytotoxic when expressed within a cell (LaPointe, J Biol Chem 280: 23310-18 (2005)). The smallest Shiga toxin A Subunit fragment exhibiting full enzymatic activity is a polypeptide composed of -36 - residues 1-239 of SltlA (LaPointe, JBiol Chem 280: 23310-18 (2005)). Although the smallest fragment of the Shiga toxin A Subunit reported to retain substantial catalytic activity was residues 75-247 of StxA (Al-Jaufy, Infect Immun 62: 956-60 (1994)), a StxA truncation expressed de novo within a eukaryotic cell requires only up to residue 240 to reach the cytosol and exert catalytic inactivation of ribosomes (LaPointe, J Biol Chem 280: 23310-18 (2005)). [113] In certain embodiments derived from SLT-1A(SEQ IDNO:l), StxA(SEQ ID ΝΟ:25), or SLT-2A (SEQ ID ΝΟ:26), these changes include substitution of the asparagine at position 75, tyrosine at position 77, tyrosine at position 114, aspartate at position 167, arginine at position 170, arginine at position 176, and/or substitution of the tryptophan at position 203. Examples of such substitutions will be known to the skilled worker based on the prior art, such as asparagine at position 75 to alanine, tyrosine at position 77 to serine, substitution of the tyrosine at position 114 to alanine, substitution of the aspartate at position 167 to glutamate, substitution of the arginine at position 170 to alanine, substitution of the arginine at position 176 to lysine, and/or substitution of the tryptophan at position 203 to alanine. [114] CD20-binding proteins of the invention may optionally be conjugated to one or more additional agents which may include therapeutic and/or diagnostic agents known.in the art. Production. Manufacture, and Purification of a CD20-Binding Protein of the Invention [115] The CD20-binding proteins of the invention may be produced using biochemical engineering techniques well known to those of skill in the art. For example, CD20-binding proteins of the invention may be manufactured by standard synthetic methods, by use of recombinant expression systems, or by any other suitable method. Thus, the CD20-binding proteins may be synthesized in a number of ways, including, e.g, methods comprising: (1) synthesizing a polypeptide or polypeptide component of a CD20-binding protein using standard solid-phase or liquid-phase methodology, either stepwise or by fragment assembly, and isolating and purifying the final peptide compound product; (2) expressing a polynucleotide that encodes a polypeptide or polypeptide component of a CD20-binding protein in a host cell and recovering the expression product from the host cell or host cell culture; or (3) cell-free in vitro expression of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide or polypeptide component of a CD20-binding protein, and recovering the expression product; or by any combination of the methods of (1), (2) or (3) to obtain fragments of the peptide component, subsequently joining (e.g. ligating) the fragments to obtain the peptide component, and recovering the peptide component. [116] It may be preferable to synthesize a polypeptide or polypeptide component of a CD20-binding protein of the invention by means of solid-phase or liquid-phase peptide synthesis. CD20-binding proteins of the invention may suitably be manufactured by standard synthetic methods. Thus, peptides may be synthesized by, e.g. methods comprising synthesizing the peptide by standard solid-phase or liquid-phase methodology, either stepwise or by fragment assembly, and isolating and purifying the final peptide product. In this context, reference may be made to WO 1998/11125 or, inter alia, Fields, G et al., Principles and Practice of Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (Synthetic Peptides, Gregory A. Grant, ed., Oxford University Press, U.K., 2nd ed., 2002) and the synthesis examples therein. [117] CD20-binding proteins of the invention may be prepared (produced and purified) using recombinant techniques well known in the art. In general, methods for preparing polypeptides by culturing host cells transformed or transfected with a vector comprising the encoding polynucleotide and recovering the polypeptide from cell culture are described in, e.g. Sambrook et al,, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY, U.S., 1989); Dieffenbach et al., PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Ν.Υ., U.S., 1995). Any suitable host cell may be used to produce a CD20-binding protein of the invention. Host cells may be cells stably or transiently transfected, transformed, transduced or infected with one or more expression vectors which drive expression of a polypeptide of the invention. In addition, a CD20-binding protein of the invention may be produced by modifying the polynucleotide encoding the CD20-binding protein that result in altering one or more amino acids or deleting or inserting one or more amino acids in order to achieve desired properties, such as changed cytotoxicity, changed cytostatic effects, changed immunogenicity, and/or changed serum half-life. [118] Accordingly, the present invention also provides methods for producing a CD20-binding protein of the invention according to above recited methods and using a polynucleotide encoding part or all of a polypeptide of the invention, an expression vector comprising at least one polynucleotide of the invention capable of encoding part or all of a polypeptide of the invention when introduced into a host cell, and/or a host cell comprising a polynucleotide or expression vector of the invention. [119] When a polypeptide or protein is expressed using recombinant techniques in a host cell or cell-free system, it is advantageous to separate (or purify) the desired polypeptide or protein away from other components, such as host cell factors, in order to obtain preparations that are of high purity or are substantially homogeneous. Purification can be accomplished by methods well known in the art, such as centrifugation techniques, extraction techniques, chromatographic and fractionation techniques (e.g. size separation by gel filtration, charge separation by ion-exchange column, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, reverse phase chromatography, chromatography on silica or cation-exchange resins such as DEAE and the like, chromatofocusing, and Protein A Sepharose chromatography to remove contaminants), and precipitation techniques (e.g. ethanol precipitation or ammonium sulfate precipitation. Any number of biochemical purification techniques may be used to increase the purity of a CD20-binding protein of the invention. In certain embodiments, the CD20-binding proteins of the invention may optionally be purified in homo-multimeric forms (i.e. a protein complex of two or more identical CD20-binding proteins). [120] In the Examples below are descriptions of non-limiting examples of methods for producing a’CD20-binding protein of the invention, as well as specific but non-limiting aspects ofCD20-binding protein production for the disclosed, exemplary, CD20-binding proteins. 23/01/2015j [PESCPAMD PCT/US 2014/023 19figgfag%ffi5 Pharmaceutical Compositions Comprising a CD20-Binding Protein of the Invention [121] The present invention provides CD20-binding proteins for use, alone or in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents, in a pharmaceutical composition, for treatment or prophylaxis of conditions, diseases, disorders, or symptoms described in further detail below (e.g. cancers, malignant tumors, ηοηmalignant tumors, and immune disorders). The present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a CD20-binding protein of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable Salt or solvate thereof, according to the invention, together with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, or vehicle. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may comprise homo-multimeric and/or hetero-multimeric forms of the CD20-binding proteins of the invention. The pharmaceutical compositions will be useful in methods of treating, ameliorating, or preventing a disease, condition, disorder, or symptom described in further detail below. Each such disease, condition, disorder, or symptom is envisioned to be a separate embodiment with respect to uses of a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention. The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions for use in at least one method of treatment according to the invention, as described in more detail below. [122] As used herein, the terms “patient” and “subject” are used interchangeably to refer to any organism, commonly vertebrates such as humans and animals, which presents symptoms, signs, and/or indications of at least one disease, disorder, or condition. These terms include mammals such as the non-limiting examples of primates, livestock animals (e.g, cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, etc.), companion animals (e.g. cats, dogs, etc.) and laboratory animals (e.g. mice, rabbits, rats, etc). [123] As used herein, “treat,” “treating,” or “treatment” and grammatical variants thereof refer to an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired clinical results. The terms may refer to slowing the onset or rate of development of a condition, disorder or disease, reducing or alleviating symptoms associated with it, generating a complete or partial regression of the condition, or some combination of any of the above. For the purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, reduction or alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilization (e.g. not worsening) of state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. “Treat,” “treating,” or “treatment” can also mean prolonging survival relative to expected survival time if not receiving treatment. A subject (e.g. a human) in need of treatment may thus be a subject already afflicted with the disease or disorder in question. The terms “treat," “treating,” or “treatment” includes inhibition or reduction of an increase in severity of a pathological state or symptoms relative to the absence of treatment, and is not necessarily meant to imply complete cessation of the relevant disease, disorder, or condition. [124] As used herein, the terms “prevent,” “preventing,” “prevention” and grammatical variants thereof refer to an approach for preventing the development of, or altering the pathology of, a condition, disease, or disorder. Accordingly, “prevention” may refer to prophylactic or preventive measures. For the purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, prevention or slowing of symptoms, progression or development of a disease, whether detectable or undetectable. A subject (e.g. a human) in need of prevention may thus be a subject not yet afflicted with the disease or disorder in question. The term “prevention” includes slowing the onset of disease relative to the absence of treatment, and is not necessarily meant to imply permanent prevention of the relevant disease, disorder or condition. Thus “preventing” or “prevention” of a condition may in certain contexts refer to reducing the risk of developing the condition, or preventing or delaying the development of symptoms associated with the condition. [125] As used herein, an “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” is an amount or dose of a composition (e.g. a therapeutic composition or agent) that produces at least one desired therapeutic effect in a subject, such as preventing or treating a target condition or beneficially alleviating a symptom associated with the condition. The most desirable therapeutically effective amount is an amount that will produce a desired efficacy of a particular treatment selected by one of skill in the art for a given subject in need thereof. This amount will vary depending upon a variety of factors understood by the skilled worker, including but not limited to the characteristics of the therapeutic compound (including activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and bioavailability), the physiological condition of the subject (including age, sex, disease type, disease stage, general physical condition, responsiveness to a given dosage, and type of medication), the nature of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or carriers in the formulation, and the route of administration. One skilled in the clinical and pharmacological arts will be able to determine a therapeutically effective amount through routine experimentation, namely by monitoring a subject’s response to administration of a compound and adjusting the dosage accordingly (see e.g. Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (Gennaro A, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, U.S., 19th ed., 1995)). Production or Manufacture of a Pharmaceutical Composition Comprising a CD20-Binding Protein of the Invention [ 126] Pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates of any of the CD20-binding proteins of the invention are likewise within the scope of the present invention. [ 127] The term “solvate” in the context of the present invention refers to a complex of defined stoichiometry formed between a solute (in casu, a polypeptide compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the invention) and a solvent. The solvent in this connection may, for example, be water, ethanol or another pharmaceutically acceptable, typically small-molecular organic species, such as, but not limited to, acetic acid or lactic acid. When the solvent in question is water, such a solvate is normally referred to as a hydrate. [ 128] CD20-binding proteins of the present invention, or salts thereof may be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions prepared for storage or administration, which typically comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, or a salt thereof, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington‘s Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co. (A. Gennaro, ed., 1985)). As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any and all physiologically acceptable, i.e. compatible, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antimicrobial agents, isotonic, and absorption delaying agents, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents include those used in formulations suitable for oral, rectal, nasal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, and transdermal) administration. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers that may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyloleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. In certain embodiments, the carrier is suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral, spinal or epidermal administration (e.g. by injection or infusion). Depending on selected route of administration, the CD20-binding protein or other pharmaceutical component may be coated in a material intended to protect the compound from the action of low pH and other natural inactivating conditions to which the active CD20-binding protein may encounter when administered to a patient by a particular route of administration. [129] The formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. In such form, the composition is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of the preparations, for example, packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet, or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these packaged forms. -43 - It may be provided in single dose injectable form, for example in the form of a pen. Compositions may be formulated for any suitable route and means of administration. Subcutaneous or transdermal modes of administration may be particularly suitable for therapeutic CD20-binding proteins described herein. [ 130] The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the presence of microorganisms may be ensured both by sterilization procedures, and by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. Isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions, may also be desirable. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. [131] A pharmaceutical composition of the invention also optionally includes a pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidant. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants are water soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (ΒΗΑ), butylated hydroxytoluene (ΒΗΤ), lecithin, propylgallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. [132] In another aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or a combination of different CD20-binding proteins of the invention, or an ester, salt or amide of any of the foregoing, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. [133] Therajpeutic compositions are typically sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition may be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier may be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, alcohol such as ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol), or any suitable mixtures. The proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by use of surfactants according to formulation chemistry well known in the art. In certain embodiments, isotonic agents, e.g. sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride may be desirable in the composition. Prolonged absorption of injectable compositions may be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption for example, monostearate salts and gelatin. [ 134] Solutions or suspensions used for intradermal or subcutaneous application typically include one or more of: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates; and tonicity adjusting agents such as, e.g., sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide, or buffers with citrate, phosphate, acetate and the like. Such preparations may be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. [ 135] Sterile injectable solutions may be prepared by incorporating a CD20-binding protein of the invention in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients described above, as required, followed by sterilization microfiltration. Dispersions may be prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a dispersion medium and other ingredients, such as those described above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying (lyophilization) that yield a powder of the active ingredient in addition to any additional desired ingredient from a sterile-filtered solution thereof. [ 136] When a therapeutically effective amount of a CD20-binding protein of the invention is designed to be administered by, e.g. intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, the binding agent will be in the form of a pyrogen-free, 23/01/20151 DESCPAMD PCT/US 2014/023 ΐ QO ΟΛ,.Λΐ^ τΛΐ γ 1 IUS2014023198ΐ parenterally acceptable aqueous solution. Methods for preparing parenterally acceptable protein solutions, taking into consideration appropriate pH, isotonicity, stability, and the like, are within the skill in the art. A preferred pharmaceutical composition for intravenous, cutaneous, or subcutaneous injection will contain, in addition to binding agents, an isotonic vehicle such as sodium chloride injection, Ringer's injection, dextrose injection, dextrose and sodium chloride injection, lactated Ringer's injection, or other vehicle as known in the art. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may also contain stabilizers, preservatives, buffers, antioxidants, or other additives well known to those of skill in the art. [ 137] As described elsewhere herein, a compound may be prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, poly orthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known to those skilled in the art (see e.g. Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems (J. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., NY, U.S., 1978)). [138] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be formulated to ensure a desired distribution in vivo. For example, the bloodbrain barrier excludes many large and/or hydrophilic compounds. To target a therapeutic compound or composition of the invention to a particular in vivo location, they can be formulated, for example, in liposomes which may comprise one or more moieties that are selectively transported into specific cells or organs, thus enhancing targeted drug delivery. Exemplary targeting moieties include folate or biotin; mannosides; antibodies; surfactant protein A receptor; pi 20 catenin and the like. Polynucleotides. Expression Vectors, and Host Cells [139] Beyond the CD20-binding proteins of the present invention, the polynucleotides which encode such CD20-binding proteins, or functional portions [DESCPAMP; PCT/US 2014/023 1 Q O OO Λ,1 3Λ,1 r 1 ^ [U S2014023.198? thereof, are within the scope of the present invention. The term “polynucleotide” is equivalent to the term “nucleic acids” both of which include polymers of deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs), polymers of ribonucleic acids (RNAs), analogs of these DNAs or RNAs generated using nucleotide analogs, and derivatives, fragments and homologs thereof. The polynucleotide of the invention may be single-, double-, or triple-stranded. Disclosed polynucleotides are specifically disclosed to include all polynucleotides capable of encoding an exemplary CD20-binding protein, for example, taking into account the wobble known to be tolerated in the third position of RNA codons, yet encoding for the same amino acid as a different RNA codon {see Stothard Ρ, Biotechniques 28: 1102-4 (2000)). [ 140] In one aspect, the invention provides polynucleotides which encode a CD20-binding protein of the invention, or a fragment or derivative thereof. The polynucleotides may include, e.g., nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide at least 50%, 55% , 60% , 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more, identical to a polypeptide comprising one of the amino acid sequences of the CD20-binding-protein. The invention also includes polynucleotides comprising nucleotide sequences that hybridize under stringent conditions to a polynucleotide which encodes a CD20-binding protein of the invention, or a fragment or derivative thereof, or the antisense or complement of any such sequence. [141] Derivatives or analogs of the polynucleotides (or CD20-binding proteins) of the invention include, inter alia, polynucleotide (or polypeptide) molecules having regions that are substantially homologous to the polynucleotides or CD20-binding proteins of the invention, e.g. by at least about 45%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 95%, 98%, or even 99% identity (with a preferred identity of 80-99%) over a polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence of the same size or when compared to an aligned sequence in which the alignment is done by a computer homology program known in the art. An exemplary program is the GAP program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for UNIX, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, Madison, WI, U.S.) using the default settings, which uses the algorithm of Smith Τ, Waterman Μ, Adv. Αρρℓ. Math. 2: 482-9 (1981). Also included are polynucleotides capable of hybridizing to the complement of a sequence encoding -47 - 23/01/2015 [DESCPAMDl PCT/US 2014/023 1 Q p OO-O.i 0,0.1 c 1US2014023198 the proteins of the invention under stringent conditions (see e.g. Ausubel F, et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY, U.S., 1993)), and below. Stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and may be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley & Sons, NY, U.S., Ch. Sec. 6.3.1-6.3.6 (1989). [142] Further, the present invention further provides expression vectors that comprise the polynucleotides within the scope of the invention. The polynucleotides capable of encoding the CD20-binding proteins of the invention may be inserted into known vectors, including bacterial plasmids, viral vectors and phage vectors, using material and methods well known in the art to produce expression vectors. Such expression vectors will include the polynucleotides necessary to support production of contemplated CD20-binding proteins within any host cell of choice or cell-free expression systems (e.g. pTxbl and ρ1ΥΕΧ2.3 described in the Examples below). The specific polynucleotides comprising expression vectors for use with specific types of host cells or cell-free expression systems are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art, can be determined using routine experimentation, or may be purchased. [143] The term “expression vector,” as used herein, refers to a polynucleotide, linear or circular, comprising one or more expression units. The term “expression unit” denotes a polynucleotide segment encoding a polypeptide of interest and capable of providing expression of the nucleic acid segment in a host cell. An expression unit typically comprises a transcription promoter, an open reading frame encoding the polypeptide of interest, and a transcription terminator, all in operable configuration. An expression vector contains one or more expression units. Thus, in the context of the present invention, an expression vector encoding a CD20- binding protein comprising a single polypeptide chain (e.g. an scFv linked to a Shiga toxin effector region) includes at least an expression unit for the single polypeptide chain, whereas a CD20-binding protein comprising, e.g. two or more polypeptide chains (e.g. one chain comprising a VL domain and a second chain comprising a Vh domain linked to a toxin effector region) includes at least two expression units, one for each of the two polypeptide chains of the CD20-binding 23/01/20151 DESCPAMD; PCT/US 2014/023 -I Q <r> ΛΛ-Λ-ΐ ,r» ο,1 C 1 y ill S2Q14023198ΐ protein. For expression of multi-chain CD20-binding proteins, an expression unit for each polypeptide chain may also be separately contained on different expression vectors (e.g. expression may be achieved with a single host cell into which expression vectors for each polypeptide chain has been introduced). [144] Expression vectors capable of directing transient or stable expression of polypeptides and proteins are well known in the art. The expression vectors generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a heterologous signal sequence or peptide, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence, each of which is well known in the art. Optional regulatory control sequences, integration sequences, and useful markers that can be employed are known in the art. [145] The term “host cell” refers to a cell which can support the replication or expression of the expression vector. Host cells may be prokaryotic cells, such as Ε. coli or eukaryotic cells {e.g. yeast, insect, amphibian, bird, or mammalian cells). Creation and isolation of host cell lines comprising a polynucleotide of the invention or capable of producing a CD20-binding protein of the invention can be accomplished using standard techniques known in the art. [146] CD20-binding proteins within the scope of the present invention may be variants or derivatives of the CD20-binding proteins described herein that are produced by modifying the polynucleotide encoding a CD20-binding protein by altering one or more amino acids or deleting or inserting one or more amino acids that may render it more suitable to achieve desired properties, such as more optimal expression by a host cell. Methods for Using a CD20-Bindine Protein or a Pharmaceutical Composition of the Invention [147] Generally, it is an object of the invention to provide pharmacologically active agents, as well as compositions comprising the same, that can be used in the prevention and/or treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions, such as cancers, tumors, immune disorders, or further pathological conditions mentioned herein. Accordingly, the present invention provides methods of using the CD20-binding proteins and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for the killing of CD20 expressing cells, delivering of additional exogenous materials into CD20 expressing cells, labeling of the interior of CD20 expressing cells, and for treating diseases, disorders, and conditions as described herein.

Accordingly, the present invention provides methods of using CD20-binding proteins with specified polypeptide sequences arid pharmaceutical compositions thereof. For example, any of the polypeptide sequences in SEQ ID NOs:l, 3 ,4,6-12, 14, 16, and/or 18-29, can be specifically utilized as a component of the CD20-binding protein used in the following methods. [149] The present invention provides methods of killing a CD20 expressing cell comprising the step of contacting the cell, either in vitro or in vivo, with a CD20-binding protein or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. In certain embodiments, a CD20-binding protein or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be used to kill CD20 expressing cells in a mixture of different cell types including non-CD20 expressing cells, such as mixtures comprising cancer cells, infected cells, and/or hematological cells. [150] In certain embodiments, a CD20-binding protein or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be used to kill cancer cells in a mixture of different cell types, such as within an organism. In certain embodiments, a CD20-binding protein or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, alone or in combination with other compounds or pharmaceutical compositions can show potent cell-kill activity when administered to a population of cells, in vitro or in vivo in a subject such as in a patient in need of treatment. By targeting the delivery of enzymatically active Shiga toxin regions using high-affinity immunoglobulin-type binding regions to CD20, this potent cell-kill activity can be restricted to specifically and selectively kill certain cell types within an organism, such as cancer cells, neoplastic cells, malignant cells, non-malignant tumor cells, or infected cells. [151] The terms “cancer cell” or “cancerous cell” refers to various neoplastic cells which grow and divide in an abnormally accelerated fashion and will be clear to the skilled person. The term cancer cell includes both malignant and non-malignant cells. Generally, cancers and/or tumors can be defined as diseases, disorders, or conditions that are amenable to treatment and/or prevention.

[ 154] It is within the scope of the present invention to utilize the CD20-b inding protein of the invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof for the purposes of ex vivo depletion of B-cells from isolated cell populations removed from a patient. [ 155] Additionally, the present invention provides a method of treating a disease, disorder, or condition in a patient comprising the step of administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the CD20-biriding proteins of the present invention or a pharmaceutical composition thereof. Contemplated diseases, disorders, and conditions that can be treated using this method include cancers, malignant tumors, non-malignant tumors, and, immune disorders. Administration of a “therapeutically effective dosage” of a compound of the invention can result in a decrease in severity of disease symptoms, an increase in frequency and duration of disease symptom-free periods, or a prevention of impairment or disability due to the disease affliction. [156] The therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention will depend on the route of administration, the type of mammal being treated, and the physical characteristics of the specific patient under consideration. These factors and their relationship to determining this amount are well known to skilled -51 - IDESCFAMD1 PCT/US 2014/023 *1 QO Ο0.Ο.1^0,1 c practitioners in the medical arts. This amount and the method of administration can be tailored to achieve optimal efficacy, and may depend on such factors as weight, diet, concurrent medication and other factors, well known to those skilled in the medical arts. The dosage sizes and dosing regimen most appropriate for human use may be guided by the results obtained by the present invention, and may be confirmed in properly designed clinical trials. An effective dosage and treatment protocol may be determined by conventional means, starting with a low dose in laboratory animals and then increasing the dosage while monitoring the effects, and systematically varying the dosage regimen as well. Numerous factors may be taken into consideration by a clinician when determining an optimal dosage for a given subject. Such considerations are known to the skilled person. [157] An acceptable route of administration may refer to any administration pathway known in the art, including but not limited to aerosol, enteral, nasal, ophthalmic, oral, parenteral, rectal, vaginal, or transdermal (eg. topical administration of a cream, gel or ointment, or by means of a transdermal patch). “Parenteral administration” is typically associated with injection at or in communication with the intended site of action, including intratumoral injection, infraorbital, infusion, intraarterial, intracapsular, intracardiac, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, intraspinal, intrastemal, intrathecal, intrauterine, intravenous, subarachnoid, subcapsular, subcutaneous, transmucosal, or transtracheal administration.

As such, CD20-binding proteins of the invention, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, will be useful in methods for treating a variety of pathological disorders in which killing or depleting target cells might be beneficial, such as, inter alia, cancer, immune disorders, and infected cells. The present invention provides methods for suppressing cell proliferation, and treating cell disorders, including neoplasia and overactive B-cells.

Such polynucleotides are specifically disclosed to include all polynucleotides capable of encoding a specified CD20-binding protein, for example, taking into account the wobble known to be tolerated in the third position of amino acid codons, yet encoding for an equivalent amino acid. Further, the present invention comprises expression vectors that comprise the polynucleotides within the scope of the invention. Such expression vectors wilt include the polynucleotides necessary to support production of the CD20-binding proteins of the invention within any host cell of choice.

the following non-limiting examples of CD20-binding proteins comprising Shiga toxin effector regions derived from A Subunits of members of the Shiga toxin family and CD20 binding regions comprising immunoglobulin-type polypeptides capable of binding extracellular parts of CD20. EXAMPLES [187] The following examples demonstrate certain embodiments of the present invention. However, it is to be understood that these examples are for illustration purposes only and do not intend, nor should any be construed, to be wholly definitive as to conditions and scope of this invention. The examples were carried out using standard techniques, which are well known and routine to those of skill in the art, except where otherwise described in detail. [188] The following examples demonstrate the ability of exemplary CD20-binding proteins to selectively kill cells which express CD20 on their cell surfaces. The exemplary CD20-binding proteins bound to extracellular antigens on CD20 expressed by targeted cell types and entered the targeted cells. The internalized 23/01/2015' [descpamd; PCT/US 2014/023 η q ο Λΐ ,^Λΐ CD20-binding proteins routed their Shiga toxin effector region to the cytosol to inactivate ribosomes and subsequently caused the apoptotic death of the targeted cells. Thus, the exemplary CD20-binding proteins were capable of internalizing within CD20 expressing cell types by virtue of their Shiga toxin effector regions inducing rapid cellular internalization after the CD20-binding proteins formed a complex with cell surface CD20. [189] These exemplary CD20-binding proteins include aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 1 (SEQ ID ΝΟ:4), aCD20scFv::SLT-lA version 2 (SEQ ID ΝΟ:16), Β9Ε9-SLT-1A (SEQ ID ΝΟ:12), and C2B8-SLT-1A (SEQ ID ΝΟ:14). EXAMPLE I - Construction, Production, and Purification of Exemplary CD20-Binding Proteins [ 190] First, a CD20 binding region and a Shiga toxin effector region were designed or selected. In the examples below, the Shiga toxin effector region was derived from the A subunit ofShiga-Iike Toxin 1 (SLT-1 A). A polynucleotide was obtained containing a fragment of SLT-1 A cloned into the ρΕΟΗΕ9Α plasmid and encoding amino acids 1-251 of SLT-1 A (Cheung Μ etal., Mol Cancer 9: 28 (2010)). [191] The CD20 binding region was designed as a recombinant scFv derived from the 1Η4 CD20 monoclonal antibody (Haisma et ah (1999), Blood 92:184-90). The two immunoglobulin variable regions (Vl and Vh) were separated by a linker (SEQ ID ΝΟ:18). [ 192] Second, the binding region and Shiga toxin effector region were combined to form a single-chain, recombinant polypeptide. In this example, a polynucleotide encoding the recombinant scFv derived from 1Η4 CD20 monoclonal antibody was cloned in frame with a “murine hinge” polynucleotide derived from polynucleotides encoding a murine IgG3 molecule (SEQ ID ΝΟ:20) and in frame with a polynucleotide encoding SLT-1A (residues 1-251 of SEQ ID ΝΟ.Τ). The full- length sequence begins with Strep-tag® (SEQ ID ΝΟ;19) encoding polynucleotide sequence cloned in frame to facilitate detection and purification. The polynucleotide sequence of this example was codon optimized for efficient expression in Ε, coli using services from DNA 2.0, Inc. (Menlo Park, CA, U.S.) to produce the expression vector which encoded aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 1. [ 193] A different CD20-binding protein comprising an influenza antigen was constructed and produced in a similar manner. DNA 2.0, Inc. (Menlo Park, CA, U.S.) synthesized the multiple polynucleotides, including the antigen sequence (SEQ IDNO:3) and the required polynucleotide components were joined in frame using vector pJ201 to create the open reading frame coding for the following single-chain polypeptide (from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus) Strep-tag® (SEQ ID NO: 19), the 1 H4-derived recombinant scFv (described above), the murine IgG3 molecule (SEQ ID ΝΟ;20), the linker (SEQ ID ΝΟ:3), and the SLT-1 A-derived sequence (residues 1-251 of SEQ ID NO: 1). This recombinant polynucleotide was cloned into ρΤΧΒ1 for polypeptide production purposes. Again, codon optimization for efficient expression in Ε. coli was performed by DNA 2.0, Inc. (Menlo Park, CA, U.S.) to produce the expression vector which encoded aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 2. [194] Third, both versions 1 and 2 of the aCD20scFv::SLT-l A recombinant CD20-binding proteins were produced by using standard techniques for both bacterial and cell-free, protein translation systems. Then the CD20-binding proteins were purified and isolated using techniques well known in the art. EXAMPLE 2 - Determining the Dissociation Constant (K]>) of Exemplary CD20-Binding Proteins [195] The cell binding characteristics of both versions 1 and 2 ofthe aCD20scFv::SLT-l A CD20-binding proteins were determined by a fluorescence-based flow cytometry assay. Each sample contained 0.5 χ 106 of either CD20 expressing cells (Raji (CD20+)) or non-expressing cells (BC1 (CD20-)) and was incubated with 100pL of various dilutions of the CD20-binding proteins in phosphate buffered saline Hyclone IX PBS (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, ΜΑ) with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, U.S.), hereinafter referred to as “IX PBS+1%BSA” for 1 hour at 4 degrees Celsius (®C). The highest concentration of CD20-binding protein was selected to lead to saturation of the reaction. The cells were washed twice with IX PBS+1 %BSA. The cells were incubated for 1 hour at 4°C with 100 pL of IX PBS+1%BSA containing 0.3 μg of anti-Strep tag® mAb-FITC (β Α01736-100, Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, U S.). The cells were washed twice with IX PBS+1%BSA,.suspended in 200pL of IX PBS, and subjected to flow cytometry. The baseline corrected mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) data for all the samples was obtained by subtracting the MFI of the FFTC alone sample (negative control) from each experimental sample. Graphs were plotted of MFI versus “concentration of protein” using Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, U.S.). Using the Prism software function of one-site binding [Υ = Binax*X / (Kq + X)] under the heading binding-saturation, the Bmax and Κ-ο were calculated using baseline corrected data. Bmax is the maximum specific binding reported in MFI. Kd is the equilibrium binding constant, reported in nano molar (ηΜ). [196] Over multiple experiments, the Kd of aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 1 for Raji (CD20+) cells was determined to be about 80-100 ηΜ. In one experiment, the Bmax for the aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 1 CD20-binding protein binding to CD20+ cells was measured to be about 140,000 MFI with a Kd of about 83 ηΜ (Table 1), whereas there was no meaningful binding to CD20- cells observed in this assay. In one experiment, the Bmax for aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 2 binding to CD20+ cells was measured to be about 110,000 MFI with a Kd of about 101 ηΜ (Table 1), whereas there was no meaningful binding to CD20- cells observed in this assay.

The kit includes Luciferase Τ7 Control DNA (L4821 Promega Madison, WI, U.Si) and TNT® Quick Master Mix. The ribosome activity reaction was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. [198] A series of 10-fold dilutions of the aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version to be tested was prepared in appropriate buffer and a series of identical TNT reaction mixture componeilts were created for each dilution. Each sample in the dilution series of the aCD20scFv;:SLT-l Aproteins was combined with each ofthe TNT reaction mixtures along with the Luciferase Τ7 Control DNA. The test samples were incubated for 1.5 hours at 30eC. After the incubation, Luciferase Assay Reagent (Ε1483 Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.) was added to all test samples and the amount of luciferase protein translation was measured by luminescence according to the manufacturer instructions. The level of translational inhibition was determined by non-linear regression analysis of log-transformed concentrations of total protein versus relative luminescence units. Using statistical software (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA, U.S.), the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value was calculated for each sample using the Prism software function of Iog(inhibitor) vs. response (three parameters) [Υ = Bottom + ((Top-Bottom) / (1+10A(X-LogIC50)))] under the heading dose-response-inhibition. The IC50 for experimental proteins and SLT-1 A-only control protein were calculated. The percent of SLT-l Αonly control protein was calculated by [(IC50 of SLT-1 A control protein / ICSO of experimental protein) χ 100]. [199] The inhibitory effect of both versions of aCD20scFv: :SLT-1 A on cell-free protein synthesis was strong. Multiple experiments determined that the IC50 of both versions of aCD20scFv::SLT-lA was around 50 picomolar (ρΜ). In one experiment, the IC50 of aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 1 on protein synthesis was 23/01/2015! fDESCPAMg PCT/US 2014/023 19 „3.0 :15 about 38 ρΜ or within 19% of the SLT-1 A-only positive control (Table 2). Similarly, the IC50 of aCD20scFv::SLT-lA version2 on protein synthesis in this cell-free assay was about 58 ρΜ or within 18% of the SLT-1 A-only positive control (Table 2). Table 2.

For example, 50 ηΜ of the respective CD 20-binding proteins were incubated with 0.8 χ 106 Raji cells for 1 hour at 37°C to allow for binding and internalization of the CD20 binding-protein. The cells were then washed with 1XPBS, fixed and permeabilized with BD cytofix/cytoperm (BD Biosciences,$an Jose, CA, U.S.), and then washed twice with IX BD Perm/Wash™ Buffer (BD Biosciences,San Jose, CA, U.S.). The celts were incubated with Alexa Fluor®-555 labeled mouse anti-SLT-1 A antibody (BEI Resources,Manassas, VA, U.S.) in IX BD Perm/Wash™ Buffer for 45 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then washed and fixed with BD cytofix (BD Biosciences,San Jose, CA, U.S.) for 10 minutes at 4°C. The cells were then washed with 1XPBS and resuspended in 1XPBS, and then the cells were allowed to adhere onto poly-L-lysine coated glass slides (VWR, Radnor, PA, U.S.). Slides were coverslipped with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-containing Vectashield (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, ΜΑ, U.S.) and viewed by Zeiss Fluorescence Microscope (Zeiss, Thomwood, NY, U.S.). [201] Immunofluorescence studies showed that aCD20scFv::SLT-lA version 1 and B9E9-SLT-1A bound to cell surfaces and entered into cells expressing CD20 within one hour at 37°C. EXAMPLE 5 - CD20+ Cell Kill Assay: Determining the cytotoxic selectivity and half-maximal cytotoxic concentrations (CDso) of CD20-Binding Proteins [202] The cytotoxicity profiles of both versions of aCD20scFv::SLT-lA were determined by a CD20+ cell kill assay. This assay determines the capacity of a CD20-binding protein to kill cells expressing CD20 on a cellular surface as compared to cells that do not express the target biomolecule. Cells were plated (2 χ 103 per well) in 20 pL media in 384 well plates. The aCD20scFv::SLT-lA protein to be tested was diluted either 5-fold or 10-fold in a IX PBS., and 5 \ih of the dilutions or buffer control were added to the cells. Control wells containing only media were used for baseline correction. The cell samples were incubated for 3 days at 37°C and in an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) with the aCD20scFv::SLT-lA to be tested or only PBS buffer. The total cell survival or percent viability was determined using a luminescent readout using the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (G7573 Promega Madison, WI, U.S.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The “percent viability” of experimental wells was calculated using the following equation: (Test RLU Average Media RLU) / (Average Cells RLU - Average Media RLU) * 100. Log polypeptide concentration versus Percent Viability was plotted using Prism software (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA, U.S.) and log (inhibitor) vs. normalized response (variable slope) analysis was used to determine the half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CD50) value for the exemplary CD20-binding proteins. In addition, cell samples from lymphoma patients were analyzed using this cell kill assay to determine the cytotoxicity profile of aCD20scFv::SLT-lA version 1. [203] Over multiple experiments, both versions of aCD20scFv::SLT-lA demonstrated CD20-specific cell kill with 10 to 1000-fold specificity compared to cell kill of CD20 negative cell lines (Table 3). The CD20-specific cell kill profile of both versions of aCD20scFv::SLT-l A also contrasted to the ability of the component SLT-1A (251) to kill cells which lacked CD20-specificity (Table 3). The CDjo values of both versions of aCD20scFv::SLT-l A protein was measured to be about 3-70 ηΜ for CD20+ cells, depending on the cell line, as compared to over 600-2,000 for CD20- cell lines (Table 3). The CD5o of the aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 1 CD20-binding protein was over 100 to 400 fold greater (less cytotoxic) for cells which did not express CD20 on a cellular surface as compared to cells expressing CD20 on a cellular surface. The CD5o of aCD20scFv: :SLT-1 A version toward human lymphoma cells from patient samples was about 7-40 ηΜ (Table 3).

A set of representative results is reported in Table 4. Over multiple experiments, aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 1 exhibited a 50 to 100-fold greater cell kill function as compared to the CD20-binding protein Β9Ε9 (SEQ ID NO: 12) (Table 4). Table 4.

These xenograft model systems rely on well-characterized mouse strains that lack graft versus host responses, among other immune system deficiencies. First, an intravenous tumor model was studied using SCID (severe combined immune deficiency) mice to create disseminated tumors throughout the mice in order to test the in vivo effects of exemplary CD20-binding proteins on human tumor cells. Second, a subcutaneous tumor model was studied using BALBc/nude mice to create subcutaneous tumors on the mice, again in order to test the in vivo effects of exemplary CD20-binding proteins on human tumor cells. [206] For the first xenograft system, thirty-two C.B.-17 SCID mice (in four groups of eight animals) were challenged with 1 χ 107 Raji-luc human lymphoma derived cells (Molecular Imaging, Ann Arbor, MI, U.S.) in 200 pL PBS. On days 5-9 and 12-16 following tumor challenge, the following groups received the IDESCPAMDI PCT/U5 2014/023 19 ρ ο c\^.rsj- following through intravenous administration : Group 1: PBS; Group 2: aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 2 at a dose of 2mg/kg; Group 3: aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 1 at a dose of2mg/kg; and Group 4: aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 1 at a dose of4mg/kg (days 5-9 only). Bioluminescence, in 1 χ 106 photons/second units (p/s), was measured on days 5, 10, 15, and 20 using a Caliper IV1S 50 optical imaging system (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, ΜΑ, U.S.). Figure 2 shows how both versions of aCD20scFv::SLT-l A, and aCD20scFv::SLT-lA version 1 at both dosage levels, resulted in statistically significant less total bioluminescence compared to the PBS control. The decrease in total bioluminescence was reflective of statistically significant reductions in disseminated tumor burdens after treatment with a CD20-binding protein of the invention. Figure 3 indicates a statistically significant increase in survival with administration of either version of aCD20scFv::SLT-l A. The mean survival age was increased by five days with all treatments compared to the PBS negative control. [207] For the second xenograft model, twenty-eight BALBc/nude (in four groups of six or seven animals) were challenged subcutaneously with 2.5 χ 106 Raji human lymphoma cells (Washington Biotechnology, Simpsonville, MD, U.S.). Tumor volume was determined using standard methods known in the art utilizing calipers. Day 0 was set at the point when the mean tumor volume for each mouse reached approximately 160 mm3 (one mouse from each group had a tumor greater than 260 mm3 so it was excluded). On days 0-4 and 7-11 the groups received intravenous administration of the following by group: Group 1: PBS; Group 2: aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 2 at a dose of 2 mg/kg; Group 3: aCD20scFv::SLT-1A version 1 at a dose of 2 mg/kg; Group 4: ctCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 1 at a dose of 4 mg/kg. Tumor volume was measured and graphed as a function of day of study. Figure 4 demonstrates how treatment with aCD20scFv::SLT-l A version 1 (at both dosage levels) resulted in significantly reduced tumor volume compared to the PBS control through to Day 24. This is also reflected in the tumor free mouse number through Day 54, reported in Table 5. Table 5.

In vivo depletion of peripheral blood Β lymphocytes in cynomolgus primates was observed after parenteral administration of different doses of aCD20scFv::SLT-lA version 1. [209] In one experiment, ten cynomolgus primates were intravenously injected with PBS or aCD20scFv::SLT-lA version 1 at different doses (50, 150, and 450 micrograms drug/kilogram body weight (mcg/kg)) on alternative days for 2 weeks. Then, peripheral blood samples collected prior to dosing on days 3 and 8 were analyzed for the percentage of B-lymphocytes which expressed CD20 (Figures 5 and 6). In cynomolgus monkeys, two distinct B-cell subsets have been described by flow-cytometry: (1) CD21 negative, CD40 positive cells which express high levels of CD20, and (2) CD21 positive and CD40 positive cells which express lower levels of CD20 (Vugmeyster Υ et al.r, Cytometry 52: 101-9 (2003)). Dose-dependent Βcell depletion as compared to baseline levels from blood samples collected prior to treatment was observed on day 3 (4, 14 and 45% decrease in animals dosed at 50, 150 and 450 mcg/kg) and day 8 (32, 52 and 75% decrease in animals dosed at 50, 150 and 450 mcg/kg) (Table 6). This experiment showed that aCD20scFv::SLT-lA version 1 was capable of killing CD20 positive, primate B-cells in vivo. Table 6.

An immunoglobulin-type binding region aCD20 is derived from the monoclonal antibody ofatumumab (Gupta I, Jewell R, Ann Ν Υ Acad Sci 1263: 43-56 (2012)) which comprises an immunoglobulin-type binding region capable of binding human CD20. Construction, Production, and Purification of the CD20-Binding Protein SLT-1Α::α℮Ρ20 [211] The immunoglobulin-type binding region aCD20 and Shiga toxin effector region are linked together to form a protein. For example, a fusion protein is produced by expressing a polynucleotide encoding the CD20-binding protein SLT-1 A::aCD20. Expression of the SLT-lA::aCD20 CD20-binding protein is accomplished using either bacterial and/or cell-free, protein translation systems as described in the previous examples. Determining the In Vitro Characteristics of the CD20-Binding Protein SLT-1Α::α℮Ρ20 [212] The binding characteristics of the CD20-binding protein of this example for CD20+ cells and CD20- cells is determined by a fluorescence-based, flowcytometry assay as described above in the previous examples. The Bmax for SLTlA::aCD20 binding to CD20+ cells is measured to be approximately 50,000- -75 - 200,000 MFI with a KD within the range of 0.01-100 ηΜ, whereas there is no significant binding to CD20- cells in this assay. [213] The ribosome inactivation capabilities of the SLT-lA::aCD20 CD20-binding protein is determined in a cell-free, in vitro protein translation as described above in the previous examples. The inhibitory effect of the CD20-binding protein of this example on cell-free protein synthesis is significant. The IC50 of SLTlA::aCD20 on protein synthesis in this cell-free assay is approximately 0.1-100 ρΜ. Determining the Cytotoxicity of the CD20-Binding Protein SLT-lA::aCD20 Using a Cell-Kill Assay [214] The cytotoxicity characteristics of SLT-1 A::aCD20 are determined by the general cell-kill assay as described above in the previous examples using CD20+ cells. In addition, the selective cytotoxicity characteristics of SLT-1 A::aCD20 are determined by the same general cell-kill assay using CD20- cells as a comparison to the CD20+ cells. The CD50 of the CD20-binding protein of this example is approximately 0.01-100 ηΜ for CD20+ cells depending on the cell line. The CD50 of the CD20-binding protein is approximately 10-10,000 fold greater (less cytotoxic) for cells not expressing CD20 on a cellular surface as compared to cells which do express CD20 on a cellular surface. Determining the In Vivo Effects of the CD20-Binding Protein SLT-1 A::aCD20 Using Animal Models [215] Animal models are used to determine the in vivo effects of the CD20-binding protein SLT-lA::aCD20 on neoplastic cells. Various mice strains are used to test the effect of the CD20-binding protein after intravenous administration on xenograft tumors in mice resulting from the injection into those mice of human neoplastic cells which express CD20 on their cell surfaces. Non-human primates may be used to test the effect of SLT-lA::aCD20 on peripheral blood B-cells as described above in Example 8. EXAMPLE 10 - CD20-binding proteins based on various CD20 binding domains [216] In this example, the Shiga toxin effector region is derived from the A subunit of Shiga-like Toxin 1 (SLT-1A), Shiga toxin (StxA), and/or Shiga-like Toxin 2 (SLT-2A). An immunoglobulin-type binding region is derived from the immunoglobulin domain from the molecule chosen from Table 7 and which binds an extracellular part of CD20. The exemplary cytotoxic proteins of this example are created and tested as described in the previous examples using CD20+ cells expressing CD20 to a cellular surface. Table 7.
