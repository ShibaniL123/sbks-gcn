CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/534,194, filed Sep. 13, 2011 and titled “Compositions and Methods For Wound Healing,” which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to compositions and methods for increasing the rate of healing of tissue wounds in animals using cationic steroid antimicrobials (CSAs). 2. Relevant Technology Wound healing is the complex and dynamic process of self-repair to restore cellular structures and tissue layers after an injury has occurred. The human wound healing process is divided into three distinct phases: the inflammatory phase, the proliferative phase, and the remodeling phase. The wound healing process may be further broken down beyond the three broad phases to a complex and coordinated series of biochemical events that include chemotaxis, phagocytosis, neocollagenesis, collagen degradation, and collagen remodeling to repair the damage. In addition, angiogenesis, epithelization, and the production of new glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans are vital to the wound healing process. The culmination of these biological processes results in the replacement of normal skin structures with fibroblastic mediated scar tissue. Prior to the initiation of the inflammatory phase, the clotting cascade begins to stop blood loss via clotting. Once clotting has begun, various soluble factors, including chemokines and cytokines, are released to attract cells to the site of injury. Growth factors, which are cytokines released by platelets, stimulate cells to accelerate their rate of division leading to increased healing rates. Platelets also release other proinflammatory factors like serotonin, bradykinin, prostaglandins, prostacyclins, thromboxane, and histamine, which serve a number of purposes, including to increase cell proliferation and migration to the area and to cause blood vessels to become dilated and porous. The inflammation phase can be further broken down into four biochemical processes. First, immediately after a blood vessel is breached, ruptured cell membranes release inflammatory factors like thromboxanes and prostaglandins that result in vasoconstriction to prevent blood loss and to collect inflammatory cells and factors. Second, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) arrive at the wound site, phagocytose debris and bacteria. Neutrophils also cleanse the wound by secreting proteases that break down damaged tissue. Third, neutrophils cleanse the injured area via the phagocytosis of debris, bacteria, neutrophils, damaged cells and tissue, and any other foreign cells or material. Macrophages also secrete a number of factors that push wound healing toward the next phase. Finally, inflammation dies down, fewer inflammatory factors are secreted, existing ones are broken down, and numbers of neutrophils and macrophages are reduced at the wound site. The proliferative phase begins with the arrival of fibroblasts at the wound site, marking the onset of the proliferative phase, which biologically begins with angiogenesis. Angiogenesis or neovascularization is the process which occurs concurrently with fibroblast proliferation when endothelial cells migrate to the area of the wound. Fibroplasia and granulation begin during angiogenesis as a result of fibroblast recruitment and extracellular matrix formation. Then collagen and fibronectin are deposited by the fibroblast at the site of tissue granulation. Once collagen deposition has occurred, epithelialization takes place as a result of the presence of keratinocytes arriving at the newly deposited extracellular matrix. The final step in the proliferative phase is contraction, which requires the presence of neomyoblasts to connect the scar tissue to the surrounding healthy tissue and to pull the edges of the scar tissue together, restoring tensile strength to the skin surrounding the previously injured area. A need exists to develop compositions and methods to enhance wound healing. BRIEF SUMMARY Disclosed herein are methods and compositions for treating a wound in a subject by increasing the rate of healing. The increased rate of healing is achieved using a cationic steroidal antimicrobial (CSA) compound. The CSA compounds include a sterol backbone and a plurality of cationic groups attached thereto. The treatment of tissue wounds with CSAs has the surprising and unexpected result of increasing the rate of wound healing. Experimental data indicates that the increased rate of wound healing is distinct from the known anti-microbial effects of CSAs. When applied to wound sites in living subjects, the CSA compounds described herein have a profound and surprising effect on the rate of wound healing. The increased rates of healing is in many cases several times faster than healing rates using traditional antimicrobials. Studies indicate that this increase in wound healing is at least in part distinct from antimicrobial benefits. CSAs have been found to increase the rate of healing even in wounds where antimicrobial load is very low or in cases where infection is not an issue. The increased rate of healing results in healthier and more natural tissue formation as compared to treatments with traditional antimicrobial compounds. The mechanism of action for the increased rate of healing is presently being studied. While the present invention is not limited to any particular mechanism, it is believed that the increased rate of tissue healing is caused by increases in fibroblastic migration and enhanced epithelial growth factors at the wound site. Subjects have also exhibited a significantly reduced sensitivity to pain. These benefits are unexpected for CSAs, which were thought to only be active against foreign microbes. In some embodiments, a method is described for increasing the rate of wound healing in a subject. The method includes (i) providing a tissue treatment composition including a cationic steroidal anti-microbial (CSA) compound, the CSA compound including a steroidal group and a plurality of cationic groups attached thereto; (ii) identifying a subject in need of accelerated healing of a tissue wound; and (iii) contacting the tissue wound with the tissue treatment composition to increase the rate of healing thereof. In some embodiments, the invention relates to a CSA for use in a novel method of treating wounds.

Similarly, a group of items linked with the conjunction ‘or’ should not be read as requiring mutual exclusivity among that group, but rather should be read as ‘and/or’ unless expressly stated otherwise. It is understood that, in any compound described herein having one or more chiral centers, if an absolute stereochemistry is not expressly indicated, then each center may independently be of R-configuration or S-configuration or a mixture thereof. Thus, the compounds provided herein may be enantiomerically pure, enantiomerically enriched, racemic mixture, diastereomerically pure, diastereomerically enriched, or a stereoisomeric mixture. In addition it is understood that, in any compound described herein having one or more double bond(s) generating geometrical isomers that can be defined as E or Z, each double bond may independently be E or Z a mixture thereof. Likewise, it is understood that, in any compound described, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included. It is to be understood that where compounds disclosed herein have unfilled valencies, then the valencies are to be filled with hydrogens or isotopes thereof, e.g., hydrogen-1 (protium) and hydrogen-2 (deuterium). It is understood that the compounds described herein can be labeled isotopically. Substitution with isotopes such as deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, such as, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. Each chemical element as represented in a compound structure may include any isotope of said element. For example, in a compound structure a hydrogen atom may be explicitly disclosed or understood to be present in the compound. At any position of the compound that a hydrogen atom may be present, the hydrogen atom can be any isotope of hydrogen, including but not limited to hydrogen-1 (protium) and hydrogen-2 (deuterium). Thus, reference herein to a compound encompasses all potential isotopic forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. It is understood that the methods and combinations described herein include crystalline forms (also known as polymorphs, which include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound), amorphous phases, salts, solvates, and hydrates. In some embodiments, the compounds described herein exist in solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, or the like. In other embodiments, the compounds described herein exist in unsolvated form. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and may be formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, or the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. In addition, the compounds provided herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the compounds and methods provided herein. Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about.” Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present embodiments. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should be construed in light of the number of significant digits and ordinary rounding approaches. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the embodiments are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. Every numerical range given throughout this specification and claims will include every narrower numerical range that falls within such broader numerical range, as if such narrower numerical ranges were all expressly written herein. Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that the upper and lower limit, and each intervening value between the upper and lower limit of the range is encompassed within the embodiments. As used herein, any “R” group(s) such as, without limitation, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, R16, R17, and R18 represent substituents that can be attached to the indicated atom. Unless otherwise specified, an R group may be substituted or unsubstituted. A “ring” as used herein can be heterocyclic or carbocyclic. The term “saturated” used herein refers to a ring having each atom in the ring either hydrogenated or substituted such that the valency of each atom is filled. The term “unsaturated” used herein refers to a ring where the valency of each atom of the ring may not be filled with hydrogen or other substituents. For example, adjacent carbon atoms in the fused ring can be doubly bound to each other. Unsaturation can also include deleting at least one of the following pairs and completing the valency of the ring carbon atoms at these deleted positions with a double bond; such as R5 and R9, R8 and R10; and R13 and R14. Whenever a group is described as being “substituted” that group may be substituted with one, two, three or more of the indicated substituents, which may be the same or different, each replacing a hydrogen atom. If no substituents are indicated, it is meant that the indicated “substituted” group may be substituted with one or more group(s) individually and independently selected from alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkynyl, acylalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, aminoalkyl, amino acid, aryl, heteroaryl, heteroalicyclyl, aralkyl, heteroaralkyl, (heteroalicyclyl)alkyl, hydroxy, protected hydroxyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, acyl, mercapto, alkylthio, arylthio, cyano, halogen (e.g., F, Cl, Br, and I), thiocarbonyl, O-carbamyl, N-carbamyl, O-thiocarbamyl, N-thiocarbamyl, C-amido, N-amido, S-sulfonamido, N-sulfonamido, C-carboxy, protected C-carboxy, O-carboxy, isocyanato, thiocyanato, isothiocyanato, nitro, oxo, silyl, sulfenyl, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, trihalomethanesulfonyl, trihalomethanesulfonamido, an amino, a mono-substituted amino group and a di-substituted amino group, Ra—O—(CH2)mO—, Rb(CH2)O—, RcC(O)O(CH2)pO—, and protected derivatives thereof. The substituent may be attached to the group at more than one attachment point. For example, an aryl group may be substituted with a heteroaryl group at two attachment points to form a fused multicyclic aromatic ring system. Biphenyl and naphthalene are two examples of an aryl group that is substituted with a second aryl group. As used herein, “Ca” or “Ca to Cb” in which “a” and “b” are integers refer to the number of carbon atoms in an alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group, or the number of carbon atoms in the ring of a cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl or heteroalicyclyl group. That is, the alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, ring of the cycloalkyl, ring of the cycloalkenyl, ring of the cycloalkynyl, ring of the aryl, ring of the heteroaryl or ring of the heteroalicyclyl can contain from “a” to “b”, inclusive, carbon atoms.

In some embodiments, compounds comprise a ring system of at least 4 fused rings, where each of the rings has from 5-7 atoms. The ring system has two faces, and contains 3 chains attached to the same face. Each of the chains contains a nitrogen-containing group that is separated from the ring system by at least one atom; the nitrogen-containing group is an amino group, e.g., a primary amino group, or a guanidino group. The compound can also contain a hydrophobic group. In some embodiments, the hydrophobic group is a substituted (C3-10)aminoalkyl group, a (C1-C10)alkyloxy(C3-10)alkyl group, or a (C1-C10)alkylamino(C3-10)alkyl group, attached to the steroid backbone. In some embodiments, the hydrophobic group is a substituted, branched, or unbranched substitutent with greater than 12, 16, 18, 20, or 22 carbons. In some embodiments, the hydrophobic group may include a hydrocarbon chain of at least 9, 11, or 13 carbons distal to a heteroatom. In some embodiments, a compound having a structure according to Formula (V) includes a hydrophobic group at R18. In some embodiments, the compounds set forth herein preserve certain stereochemical and electronic characteristics found in steroids. The term “same configuration” as used herein refers to substituents on the fused steroid having the same stereochemical orientation. For example, in some embodiments, substituents R3, R7 and R12 are all β-substituted or α-substituted. In some embodiments, compounds include, but are not limited to, compounds having amine or guanidine groups covalently attached to a steroid backbone or scaffold at any carbon position, e.g., cholic acid. In various embodiments, a group is covalently attached at any one, or more, of positions C3, C7 and C12 of the steroid backbone or scaffold. In additional embodiments, a group is absent from anyone, or more, of positions C3, C7 and C12 of the steroid backbone or scaffold. Compounds that include such groups can include a tether, the tether having variable chain length or size. As used herein, the terms “tether” or “tethered,” when used in reference to a compound, refers to the chain of atoms between the steroid backbone or scaffold and a terminal amino or guanidine group. In various embodiments, a tether is covalently attached at anyone, or more, of positions C3, C7 and C12. In additional embodiments, a tether is lacking at anyone, or more, of positions C3, C7 and C12. A tether length may include the heteroatom (O or N) covalently attached to the steroid backbone. The tether may include a hydrolysable linkage such as an ester linkage. In some embodiments, other ring systems can also be used, e.g., 5-member fused rings. Compounds with backbones having a combination of 5- and 6-membered rings are also contemplated. Amine or guanidine groups can be separated from the backbone by at least one, two, three, four or more atoms. The backbone can be used to orient the amine or guanidine groups on one face, or plane, of the steroid. For example, a scheme showing a compound having primary amino groups on one face, or plane, of a backbone is shown in Scheme I above. The compounds and compositions disclosed herein are optionally prepared as pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” as used herein is a broad term, and is to be given its ordinary and customary meaning to a skilled artisan (and is not to be limited to a special or customized meaning), and refers without limitation to a salt of a compound that does not cause significant irritation to an organism to which it is administered and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the compound. In some embodiments, the salt is an acid addition salt of the compound. Pharmaceutical salts can be obtained by reacting a compound with inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid), sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and phosphoric acid. Pharmaceutical salts can also be obtained by reacting a compound with an organic acid such as aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic or sulfonic acids, for example formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, nicotinic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluensulfonic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, muconic acid, butyric acid, phenylacetic acid, phenylbutyric acid, valproic acid, 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, or naphthalenesulfonic acid. Pharmaceutical salts can also be obtained by reacting a compound with a base to form a salt such as an ammonium salt, an alkali metal salt, such as a lithium, sodium or a potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt, such as a calcium, magnesium or aluminum salt, a salt of organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine, C1-C7 alkylamine, cyclohexylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethanolamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, tromethamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine and lysine; or a salt of an inorganic base, such as aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, or the like. The forgoing compositions may be used for the novel use of increasing the rate of wound healing in a subject with a tissue wound.

As such, in yet another aspect, tissue treatment compositions useful in the methods and uses of the disclosed embodiments are provided. More particularly, the tissue treatment compositions described herein may be useful, inter alia, for treating or promoting wound healing in a subject. A tissue treatment composition is any composition that may be administered in vitro or in vivo or both to a subject in order to promote or enhance wound healing. In a preferred embodiment, a tissue treatment compositions may be administered in vivo. As used herein the terms “pharmaceutically acceptable” and “physiologically acceptable” mean a biologically compatible formulation, gaseous, liquid or solid, or mixture thereof, which is suitable for one or more routes of administration, in vivo delivery, or contact. A formulation is compatible in that it does not destroy activity of an active ingredient therein (e.g., a CSA), or induce adverse side effects that far outweigh any prophylactic or therapeutic effect or benefit. In an embodiment, the tissue treatment compositions may be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as carriers, solvents, stabilizers, adjuvants, diluents, etc., depending upon the particular mode of administration and dosage form. The tissue treatment compositions should generally be formulated to achieve a physiologically compatible pH, and may range from a pH of about 3 to a pH of about 11, preferably about pH 3 to about pH 7, depending on the formulation and route of administration. In alternative embodiments, it may be preferred that the pH is adjusted to a range from about pH 5.0 to about pH 8. More particularly, the tissue treatment compositions may comprise a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of at least one compound as described herein, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Optionally, the tissue treatment compositions may comprise a combination of the compounds described herein, or may include a second active ingredient useful in the treatment or prevention of bacterial infection (e.g., anti-bacterial or anti-microbial agents). Formulations, e.g., for parenteral or oral administration, are most typically solids, liquid solutions, emulsions or suspensions, while inhalable formulations for pulmonary administration are generally liquids or powders, with powder formulations being generally preferred. A preferred tissue treatment composition may also be formulated as a lyophilized solid that is reconstituted with a physiologically compatible solvent prior to administration. Alternative tissue treatment compositions may be formulated as syrups, creams, ointments, tablets, and the like. In general, formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately associating the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. For example, a tablet may be made by compression or molding. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, an active ingredient (e.g., a CSA) in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be produced by molding, in a suitable apparatus, a mixture of powdered compound (e.g., CSA) moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide a slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. Cosolvents and adjuvants may be added to the formulation. Non-limiting examples of cosolvents contain hydroxyl groups or other polar groups, for example, alcohols, such as isopropyl alcohol; glycols, such as propylene glycol, polyethyleneglycol, polypropylene glycol, glycol ether; glycerol; polyoxyethylene alcohols and polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters. Adjuvants include, for example, surfactants such as, soya lecithin and oleic acid; sorbitan esters such as sorbitan trioleate; and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Additionally, the tissue treatment compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous emulsion or oleaginous suspension. This emulsion or suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents, which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,2-propane-diol. The sterile injectable preparation may also be prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables. To obtain a stable water-soluble dose form of a tissue treatment compositions, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound described herein may be dissolved in an aqueous solution of an organic or inorganic acid, such as 0.3 M solution of succinic acid, or more preferably, citric acid. If a soluble salt form is not available, the compound may be dissolved in a suitable co-solvent or combination of co-solvents. Examples of suitable co-solvents include alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 300, polysorbate 80, glycerin and the like in concentrations ranging from about 0 to about 60% of the total volume. In one embodiment, the active compound is dissolved in DMSO and diluted with water. The pharmaceutical composition may also be in the form of a solution of a salt form of the active ingredient in an appropriate aqueous vehicle, such as water or isotonic saline or dextrose solution. Also contemplated are compounds which have been modified by substitutions or additions of chemical or biochemical moieties which make them more suitable for delivery (e.g., increase solubility, bioactivity, palatability, decrease adverse reactions, etc.), for example by esterification, glycosylation, PEGylation, etc. In one embodiment, the compounds described herein may be formulated for oral administration in a lipid-based formulation suitable for low solubility compounds. Lipid-based formulations can generally enhance the oral bioavailability of such compounds. In some exemplary embodiments, a CSA comprises a multimer (e.g., a dimer, trimer, tetramer, or higher order polymer). In some exemplary embodiments, the CSAs can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions or formulations. Such compositions/formulations are useful for administration to a subject, in vivo or ex vivo. Tissue treatment compositions and formulations include carriers or excipients for administration to a subject. Such formulations include solvents (aqueous or non-aqueous), solutions (aqueous or non-aqueous), emulsions (e.g., oil-in-water or water-in-oil), suspensions, syrups, elixirs, dispersion and suspension media, coatings, isotonic and absorption promoting or delaying agents, compatible with pharmaceutical administration or in vivo contact or delivery. Aqueous and non-aqueous solvents, solutions and suspensions may include suspending agents and thickening agents. Such pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include tablets (coated or uncoated), capsules (hard or soft), microbeads, powder, granules and crystals. Supplementary active compounds (e.g., preservatives, antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal agents) can also be incorporated into the compositions. Cosolvents and adjuvants may be added to the formulation. Non-limiting examples of cosolvents contain hydroxyl groups or other polar groups, for example, alcohols, such as isopropyl alcohol; glycols, such as propylene glycol, polyethyleneglycol, polypropylene glycol, glycol ether; glycerol; polyoxyethylene alcohols and polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters. Adjuvants include, for example, surfactants such as, soya lecithin and oleic acid; sorbitan esters such as sorbitan trioleate; and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Additionally, it may be desirable to include other therapeutically beneficial agents in the formulation. For example, the vehicles or carriers may also include humectants or moisturizers to maintain a desired moisture level in the treated area. Other possibilities include drugs such as anesthetics or antibiotics, which provide other desired effects. Again, the possibilities are unlimited and are left to the practitioner. A tissue treatment composition contains a total amount of the active ingredient(s) sufficient to achieve an intended therapeutic effect. In some embodiments, the tissue treatment composition includes the CSA in a weight/weight concentration of at least 0.001%, 0.01%, 0.1%, 1.0%, and/or less than 80%, 50%, 25%, 15%, 10%, or 5%, or within a range between any of the foregoing lower and upper endpoints. In some embodiments, the tissue treatment composition includes the CSA in a weight/weight concentration of about 0.04%. In other embodiments, the tissue treatment composition includes the CSA in a weight/weight concentration of less than 0.1%. In some embodiments, the tissue treatment composition includes the CSA in a weight/weight concentration of between about 0.01% and about 2.0%. Methods and Uses Methods disclosed herein include identifying a subject with a tissue wound and administering a tissue treatment composition including a CSA, thereby increasing the rate of wound healing. In some embodiments, the method includes (i) providing a tissue treatment composition as described above; (ii) identifying a subject in need of accelerated healing of a tissue wound; and (iii) contacting the tissue wound with the tissue treatment composition to increase the rate of healing thereof. In some embodiments, the subject is an animal. In some embodiments, the animal is a mammal. The mammal may be a human or primate in some embodiments. A mammal includes any mammal, such as by way of non-limiting example, cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, camels, buffalo, cats, dogs, rats, mice, and humans. Preferably the subject is a human, horse, or dog. In some embodiments, the subject is a vertebrate. In other embodiments, the subject is a non-human animal. The subject has a tissue wound in need of healing and/or accelerated healing. Unless specified, the term “wound” is used herein in its generic sense, meaning that it encompasses all types of wounds and injuries. The term “wound” encompasses burns, ulcers, lacerations, incisions, etc. “Wound” and “lesion” may be used interchangably herein, and unless the context specifically dictates otherwise, no distinction is intended. Lesions/wounds can be acute or chronic. Wounds can be full thickness, i.e., penetrating all layers of skin, or partial thickness, i.e., penetrating less than all layers of skin. Examples of acute wounds include, but are not limited to, surgical wounds (i.e., incisions), penetrating wounds, avulsion injuries, crushing injuries, shearing injuries, burn injuries, lacerations, and bite wounds. Examples of chronic wounds include, but are not limited to, ulcers, such as arterial ulcers, venous ulcers, pressure ulcers, and diabetic ulcers. Of course, acute wounds can become chronic wounds. In some embodiments, the tissue wound can be a navel of a newborn subject (i.e., a newborn with navel ill). The tissue treatment composition can be applied to an open wound or a closed wound. In some embodiments the composition is applied to an open wound for a period of sufficient time to cause closure of the wound. The composition can be applied at least once or twice daily at least 2, 4, 8, or 16 times and/or for over a period of at least 2, 4, 8, or 16 days. The compositions disclosed herein can be administered to any wound, anywhere it is desirable to promote wound healing. The compositions are also useful to reduce scarring after a wound is closed and/or healed. The compositions can be applied in any form of vehicle or carrier, including but not limited to, liquids, gels, lotions, creams, pastes, and ointments. The means of application will depend upon what form the composition takes: liquids can be sprayed or poured, for example; gels, lotions, creams, pastes, and ointments can be rubbed or massaged, for example. These and other forms, and/or carriers/vehicles, for composition delivery, are described in publications such as Remington's Pharmaceutical Science, and other similar publications. The delivery forms can be homogeneous, e.g., forms in which the composition is in solution, or heterogeneous, e.g., forms in which the composition is contained within liposomes or microspheres. The forms can produce an immediate effect, and can alternatively, or additionally, produce an extended effect. For example, liposomes, or microspheres, or other similar means of providing an extended release of the composition, can be used to extend the period during which the composition is exposed to the lesion; non-encapsulated compositions can also be provided for an immediate effect. The delivery forms can also take the form of devices, which can deliver the composition to a lesion for a desired period of time. Devices include, but are not limited to, bandages, surgical dressings, gauzes, adhesive strips, surgical staples, clips, hemostats, intrauterine devices, sutures, trocars, catheters, tubes, collagen sponges, and implants. Implants include, but are not limited to, pills, pellets, rods, wafers, discs, and tablets. Devices according to the disclosure can be prepared according to known methods, and can include, or be made from, polymeric material. In some instances, the polymeric material will be an absorbable material and in other instances, a non-absorbable material, or in other instances a resorbable material. Devices can include absorbable, non-absorbable, resorbable materials, and combinations thereof. Absorbable materials can be synthetic materials and non-synthetic materials. Absorbable synthetic materials include, but are not limited to, cellulosic polymers, glycolic acid polymers, methacrylate polymers, ethylene vinyl acetate polymers, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymers, polycaptrolactam, polyacetate, copolymers of lactide and glycolide, polydioxanone, polyglactin, poliglecaprone, polyglyconate, polygluconate, and combinations thereof. Absorbable non-synthetic materials include, but are not limited to, catgut, cargile membrane, fascia lata, gelatin, collagen, and combinations thereof. Nonabsorbable synthetic materials include, but are not limited to nylons, rayons, polyesters, polyolefins, and combinations thereof. Non-absorbable non-synthetic materials include, but are not limited to, silk, dermal silk, cotton, linen, and combinations thereof. Combinations of the foregoing devices and carriers/vehicles are also envisioned. For example, a CSA gel or ointment can be impregnated into a bandage or wound dressing for delivery of the CSA to the desired location. As another example, an implantable absorbable device can be loaded with a CSA solution and release the solution from the device over a period as desired. It may be desirable to provide for other conditions in the practice of the present methods. For example, it may be desirable to ensure that the target region of the lesion is sufficiently oxygenated; generally, it is sufficient that atmospheric oxygen be present. It also may be desirable to maintain a desired level of moisture and a particular temperature; in some embodiments, a warm, moist environment is desirable. While not required, it may also be desirable to establish or maintain a sterile environment. In some embodiments, the composition may be incorporated into a medical device coating. One of ordinary skill in the art to which these exemplary embodiments belong will understand that the compositions may be administered in numerous ways. For example, administration may mean simply applying the compositions to a wound directly. In some exemplary embodiments, administration may be enteral, parenteral, or topical. Other exemplary routes of administration for contact or in vivo delivery which a compound can optionally be formulated include inhalation, respiration, intubation, intrapulmonary instillation, oral (buccal, sublingual, mucosal), intrapulmonary, rectal, vaginal, intrauterine, intradermal, topical, dermal, parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intraocular, intratracheal and epidural), intranasal, intrathecal, intraarticular, intracavity, transdermal, iontophoretic, ophthalmic, optical (e.g., corneal), intraglandular, intraorgan, intralymphatic. Dosage Compounds (e.g., CSAs), including pharmaceutical formulations can be packaged in unit dosage forms for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. A “unit dosage form” as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of compound optionally in association with a pharmaceutical carrier (excipient, diluent, vehicle or filling agent) which, when administered in one or more doses, is calculated to produce a desired effect (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic effect or benefit). Unit dosage forms can contain a daily dose or unit, daily sub-dose, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an administered compound (e.g., CSA). Unit dosage forms also include, for example, capsules, troches, cachets, lozenges, tablets, ampules and vials, which may include a composition in a freeze-dried or lyophilized state; a sterile liquid carrier, for example, can be added prior to administration or delivery in vivo. Unit dosage forms additionally include, for example, ampules and vials with liquid compositions disposed therein. Unit dosage forms further include compounds for transdermal administration, such as “patches” that contact with the epidermis of the subject for an extended or brief period of time. The individual unit dosage forms can be included in multi-dose kits or containers. Pharmaceutical formulations can be packaged in single or multiple unit dosage forms for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Compounds (e.g., CSAs) can be administered in accordance with the methods at any frequency as a single bolus or multiple dose e.g., one, two, three, four, five, or more times hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or annually or between about 1 to 10 days, weeks, months, or for as long as appropriate. Exemplary frequencies are typically from 1-7 times, 1-5 times, 1-3 times, 2-times or once, daily, weekly or monthly. Timing of contact, administration ex vivo or in vivo delivery can be dictated by the infection, pathogenesis, symptom, pathology or adverse side effect to be treated. For example, an amount can be administered to the subject substantially contemporaneously with, or within about 1-60 minutes or hours of the onset of a symptom or adverse side effect, pathogenesis, or vaccination. Doses may vary depending upon whether the treatment is therapeutic or prophylactic, the onset, progression, severity, frequency, duration, probability of or susceptibility of the symptom, the type pathogenesis to which treatment is directed, clinical endpoint desired, previous, simultaneous or subsequent treatments, general health, age, gender or race of the subject, bioavailability, potential adverse systemic, regional or local side effects, the presence of other disorders or diseases in the subject, and other factors that will be appreciated by the skilled artisan (e.g., medical or familial history). Dose amount, frequency or duration may be increased or reduced, as indicated by the clinical outcome desired, status of the infection, symptom or pathology, any adverse side effects of the treatment or therapy. The skilled artisan will appreciate the factors that may influence the dosage, frequency and timing required to provide an amount sufficient or effective for providing a prophylactic or therapeutic effect or benefit. In instances where animal and/or human dosages for compounds have been established for at least some condition, those same dosages may be used, or dosages that are between about 0.1% and 500%, more preferably between about 25% and 250% of the established animal and/or human dosage. Where no animal and/or human dosage is established, as will be the case for newly-discovered pharmaceutical compositions, a suitable animal and/or human dosage can be inferred from ED50 or ID50 values, or other appropriate values derived from in vitro or in vivo studies, as qualified by toxicity studies and efficacy studies in animals. In cases of administration of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, dosages may be calculated as the free base. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, in certain situations it may be necessary to administer the compounds disclosed herein in amounts that exceed, or even far exceed, the above-stated, preferred dosage range in order to effectively and aggressively treat particularly aggressive diseases or conditions. From preliminary studies, it found that toxicity for CSA compounds was greatly reduced at 5 μM and lower doses. An optimal standalone dose of CSAs may be 10 μM or less at, on, or near the tissue wound, but smaller amounts may be used to minimize toxicity as needed. Kits Kits comprising the tissue treatment compositions and instructions for performing such methods are also disclosed. The disclosure also provides kits including compounds (e.g., CSA), combination compositions and pharmaceutical compositions/formulations thereof, packaged into a suitable packaging material. In one embodiment, a kit includes packaging material, a CSA, and instructions. In various aspects, the instructions are for administering the CSA to enhance wound healing in a subject with a tissue wound. Where the tissue treatment composition is to be sprayed, the kit may include a spray container. The term “packaging material” refers to a physical structure housing one or more components of the kit. The packaging material can maintain the components sterilely, and can be made of material commonly used for such purposes (e.g., paper, corrugated fiber, glass, plastic, foil, ampules, vials, tubes, etc.). A kit can contain a plurality of components, e.g., two or more compounds alone or in combination with a wound healing agent or treatment or drug, optionally sterile. A kit optionally includes a label or insert including a description of the components (type, amounts, doses, etc.), instructions for use in vitro, in vivo, or ex vivo, and any other components therein. Labels or inserts include “printed matter,” e.g., paper or cardboard, or separate or affixed to a component, a kit or packing material (e.g., a box), or attached to an ampule, tube or vial containing a kit component. Labels or inserts can additionally include a computer readable medium, such as a disk (e.g., floppy diskette, hard disk, ZIP disk), optical disk such as CD- or DVD-ROM/RAM, DVD, MP3, magnetic tape, or an electrical storage media such as RAM and ROM or hybrids of these such as magnetic/optical storage media, FLASH media or memory type cards. EXAMPLES Example 1 A horse with a chronic non-healing oral cutaneous fistula was first treated with two prior art treatments with no success. The first treatment was with an aqueous spray of Vetericyn (0.007% hypochlorite) for a period of 7 days. The second unsuccessful treatment used Furacin Salve rubbed onto the open wound and applied daily for a period of 5 days with no appreciable improvement in wound healing. The wound was successfully treated in 7 days by spraying a composition of 0.04% CSA in water to the wound once daily for 7 days. The CSA-44 had the following structure Closer of the fistula and healthy tissue were achieved in 7 days. Example 2 A horse with a torn right front shoulder on a T post had a wound that was approximately 4 inches by 6 inches and 3 inches deep. This wound occurs commonly in horses and usually takes 3 to 6 months to heal. Typically this wound will result in a significant loss of muscle in the region. This wound was treated twice a day with a 0.04% solution of CSA-44 in water. The tissue treatment composition was applied by spraying sufficient composition to wet the entire surface of the wound. The wound closed and completely healed in 28 days without any apparent muscle loss of muscle. This result is surprising and unexpected given the location and size of wound and the typical length of time typically need for this type of wound to heal. Example 3 A reining broodmare in Texas was involved in an accident resulting in a laceration to her left hind cannon region. The wound was 3 inches in length and 2 inches wide. The laceration extended all the way to the cannon bone, exposing the periosteum. This wound was also treated with a 0.04% solution of CSA-44 in water twice daily. No wrap was applied (i.e., no immobilization). The wound closed in 11 days with normal hair growth at 30 days. This type of wound would usually require aggressive wraps for 3 months with the possibility of other procedures being necessary for the excessive granulation tissue that commonly develops. Example 4 A horse with an extreme case of scratches was successfully healed using CSA. Scratches is a fungal infection of the lower extremities in horses. This infection usually results in not only a fungal but also a secondary bacterial infection. In this case, the horse developed severe and debilitating granulation tissue of the ankle resulting in poor mobility due to cracking and bleeding. Prior to treatment with CSA, the wound was unsuccessfully treated with an oral antifungal, antibiotic (Naxcel), and Veterycin. The chronic infection persisted for over two years despite the multiple attempts to treat with an antimicrobial. Due to the debilitating wound the horse was slated for slaughter. However, the wound was successfully treated with a 0.04% of CSA-44 in water sprayed twice daily for four weeks. Normal hair growth and tissue was present in 4 weeks. Example 5 A show mare developed an uncontrollable fungal infection of the skin. This malady is commonly referred to as summer itch. A 0.04% solution of CSA-44 in water was used twice daily for 3 weeks resulting in complete regrowth of normal skin and hair. Normal treatment time periods for this problem usually range from 3 to 4 months. Example 6 Genetically diabetic 8-week-old female mice (db/db, BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J) and heterozygous nondiabetic littermates (db/−) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me.). Strain and age of mouse were chosen because these mutant mice exhibit severe diabetic conditions, with hyperglycemia peaking between 8 and 12 weeks. They have also been shown to have delayed wound healing with occlusive dressings. Mice were ordered to arrive at 7 weeks of age in order to decrease the chance of travel stress effect as a confounding factor in our experiment. Mice were housed individually in the Veteran's Affairs Medical Center—San Francisco Animal Research Facility, maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle, and allowed ad libitum access to rodent chow and water. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of diluted chloral hydrate syrup (7½ gr/5 ml). Approximately 0.2 and 0.1 ml of a solution containing 5 ml of syrup diluted with 7 ml of ddH20 was given to each db/db and db/− mouse respectively. For each mouse, the dorsal skin was shaved, and cleansed with alcohol swabs. Mice were kept warm during anesthesia and surgery by being huddled together until they regained consciousness. Two full-thickness 6-mm punch biopsy (Acuderm, Inc., Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.) wounds were created on the dorsal surface of the mice. Wounds were placed approximately 1-2 cm apart. Areas that were chosen were free of anagen hair follicles. A piece of CSA impregnated film, approximately 6 mm in diameter, was placed in the wound. This film lay adjacent, touching the wound edges. Mastisol was applied to the edges of each wound, which was then covered with a 1×1 cm Tegaderm semiocclusive dressing. To analyze the effect of the CSA impregnated film, digital photographs of wounds, including a metric ruler, were taken on day zero and then every fourth day until complete wound closure was achieved. Prior to postoperative day 15, if Tegaderm dressing and/or impregnated film fell off, they were promptly replaced with a new dressing and/or film. On postoperative day 15, Tegaderm dressings were removed and wounds were allowed to close by contraction. On subsequent days, scabs were gently removed from the wounds not covered because they decrease the rate of wound contraction and impair assessment of wound closure. All wounds were compared to their original wound size using ImageJ (Rasband WS, NIH, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/, 1997-2006). Example 7 determine the role of synthetic Ceragenins CSA-13, 44 and 90 in wound healing using mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), targeted mRNA panels from SABiosciences, and primary cells from Lonza were selected. Cells were purchased from Lonza.com and used fresh for each test using recommended media and culture conditions. After treatment, mRNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit®, and quantified using a NanoDrop 2000® by UV at 260 nm and 260/280 ratio for purity. cDNA was made using a First Strand Kit® from SABiosciences and processed for real time PCR using a kit from the same company for selected analysis of wound healing pathways. Results from q-PCR were uploaded to the SABiosciences site and to Ingenuity.com web site for analysis and pathway mapping. SABiosciences wound healing array plates (Cat# PAHS-121) and innate/acquired immune response plates (PAHS-052) were used. These arrays are fully validated when used as recommended. On day 1, primary human MSC cells were plated at 200,000 cells/well using 6-well plates with 3 ml of recommended media—hMSC Basal Medium+BulletKit (50 ml Growth Supplement, 10 ml L-Glutamine and 0.5 ml Gentamicin Sulfate Amphotercin-B) for 24 hours. Only early passages of cells were used, and never from frozen stock. On day 2, cells were treated with compounds dissolved in DMSO diluted 1:1000 or more to avoid effects of the solvent. Final testing concentration for CSA-13 was 5.0 μM. Treatment lasted 8 hours, and was followed by RNA isolation using QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit® (74104). RNA was measured at 260/280 nm using a NanoDrop 2000® and normalized to 2.4 ng per well, cDNA preparation was done using QIAGEN First Strand kit 330401. q-PCR was run as absolute quantification and threshold set at 0.1 units. Dendritic cells were plated at 500,000 cells/well using 24-well plate with 500 ul of Lonza LGM-3 Complete Growth Medium with and without compound. Treatment lasted 8 hours, and was followed by RNA isolation using QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit® (74104). RNA was measured at 260/280 nm using NanoDrop2000® and normalized to 2.4 ng per well, cDNA preparation was done using QIAGEN First Strand kit 330401. PCR was run as absolute quantification and threshold set at 0.1 units. For the wound healing array, strong upregulation of growth factors such as HB-EGF and cell migration factors such as MMP1 and CXCL2 were found, indicating a clear potential for CSA as a modulator of wound healing.
