(5) Preparation of (2S,5S)-1-(tert-butyl) 2-ethyl 5-((benzyloxy)amino)piperidine-1,2-dicarboxylate
(2S,5R)-1-(tert-butyl) 2-ethyl 5-(N-(benzyloxy)-2-nitrophenylsulfonamido)piperidine-1,2-dicarboxylate (210 g, 372.59 mol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (2000 mL), to which lithium hydroxide monohydrate (31.1 g, 741.11 mmol) and n-dodecanethiol (149.5 g, 738.63 mmol) were added, reacted at room temperature overnight. Water (4000 mL) was added, extracted with ethyl acetate (1000 mL Ã— 3), the organic phases were combined, washed with saturated brine (1000 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated, and the crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography (ethyl acetate : petroleum ether = 1:5) to obtain the title compound as yellow oil (90 g, yield 64%).
