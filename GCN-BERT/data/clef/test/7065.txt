Step 14 Synthesis of Compound I-226
To Compound 184 (72.1 mg, 0.131 mmol) in ethanol (1.00 mL) solution was added 2 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution (0.500 mL), and the mixture was stirred at 80Â°C for 160 minutes. After cooling, 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid (0.500 mL) was added under ice-cooling thereto. The precipitated crystals were collected by filtration to obtain Compound I-226 (48.1 mg, 69% yield).
