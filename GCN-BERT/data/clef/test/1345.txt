The preferred embodiments of the invention mentioned herein below have to be understood as being preferred either independently from each other or in combination with one another. Various methods for enhancing the performance of pesticides are known: WO 2011/039172 discloses a method for preparing a salt of a anionic pesticide and a cationic polyamine. The polyamine reduced the volatility of the anionic pesticide. WO 2011/008453 discloses guanidine derivatives of glyphosate. EP 0 988 790 discloses a fungicidal composition comprising synergistically effective amounts of azolopyrimidine derivatives and at least one further fungicide, such as dodine (dodecylguanidine). The known adjuvants still may be further improved in order to further enhance the performance of pesticides. Object of the present invention was to find a method to enhance the performance of a pesticide. Another object was to reduce the volatility of a pesticide and/or the biological efficacy of a pesticide. The object was solved by a method for enhancing the performance of a pesticide comprising the step of contacting an adjuvant and the pesticide, wherein the pesticide is present in a concentration of less than 10 wt % in the resulting composition containing the adjuvant and the pesticide, and wherein the adjuvant contains a guanidine of the formula (A) and/or a salt thereof, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are independently H, C1-C30-alkyl, C2-C15-alkandiyl, C2-C30-alkenyl, C6-C12-aryl, C7-C30-alkylaryl, —(CH2)m—(NR6(CH2)n)x—NR7R8 or —(CH2)m—CH(NH2)CH(NH2)R8, polyethyleneimino, or heterosubstituted derivatives thereof;R6 and R7 are independently hydrogen or C1-C6-alkyl;R8 is C1-C30 alkyl or —C(NH)NH2; andm, n and x are independently an integer from 1 to 10.

These herbicide resistance technologies are, for example, described in Pest Management Science 61, 2005, 246; 61, 2005, 258; 61, 2005, 277; 61, 2005, 269; 61, 2005, 286; 64, 2008, 326; 64, 2008, 332; Weed Science 57, 2009, 108; Australian Journal of Agricultural Research 58, 2007, 708; Science 316, 2007, 1185; and references quoted therein.

Furthermore, plants are also covered that are by the use of recombinant DNA techniques capable to synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins, especially those known from the bacterial genus Bacillus, particularly from Bacillus thuringiensis, such as ä-endotoxins, e.g. CryIA(b), CryIA(c), CryIF, CryIF(a2), CryIIA(b), CryIIIA, CryIIIB(b1) or Cry9c; vegetative insecticidal proteins (VIP), e.g. VIP1, VIP2, VIP3 or VIP3A; insecticidal proteins of bacteria colonizing nematodes, e.g. Photorhabdus spp. or Xenorhabdus spp.; toxins produced by animals, such as scorpion toxins, arachnid toxins, wasp toxins, or other insect-specific neurotoxins; toxins produced by fungi, such Streptomycetes toxins, plant lectins, such as pea or barley lectins; agglutinins; proteinase inhibitors, such as trypsin inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors, patatin, cystatin or papain inhibitors; ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP), such as ricin, maize-RIP, abrin, luffin, saporin or bryodin; steroid metabolism enzymes, such as 3-hydroxy-steroid oxidase, ecdysteroid-IDP-glycosyl-transferase, cholesterol oxidases, ecdysone inhibitors or HMG-CoA-reductase; ion channel blockers, such as blockers of sodium or calcium channels; juvenile hormone esterase; diuretic hormone receptors (helicokinin receptors); stilben synthase, bibenzyl synthase, chitinases or glucanases. In the context of the present invention these insecticidal proteins or toxins are to be under-stood expressly also as pre-toxins, hybrid proteins, truncated or otherwise modified proteins. Hybrid proteins are characterized by a new combination of protein domains, (see, e.g. WO 02/015701). Further examples of such toxins or genetically modified plants capable of synthesizing such toxins are disclosed, e.g., in EP-A 374 753, WO 93/007278, WO 95/34656, EP-A 427 529, EP-A 451 878, WO 03/18810 and WO 03/52073. The methods for producing such genetically modified plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, e.g. in the publications mentioned above. These insecticidal proteins contained in the genetically modified plants impart to the plants producing these proteins tolerance to harmful pests from all taxonomic groups of athropods, especially to beetles (Coeloptera), two-winged insects (Diptera), and moths (Lepidoptera) and to nematodes (Nematoda). Genetically modified plants capable to synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins are, e.g., described in the publications mentioned above, and some of which are commercially available such as YieldGard® (corn cultivars producing the Cry1Ab toxin), YieldGard® Plus (corn cultivars producing Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 toxins), Starlink® (corn cultivars producing the Cry9c toxin), Herculex® RW (corn cultivars producing Cry34Ab1, Cry35Ab1 and the enzyme Phosphinothricin-N-Acetyltransferase [PAT]); NuCOTN® 33B (cotton cultivars producing the Cry1Ac toxin), Bollgard® I (cotton cultivars producing the Cry1Ac toxin), Bollgard® II (cotton cultivars producing Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab2 toxins); VIPCOT® (cotton cultivars producing a VIP-toxin); NewLeaf® (potato cultivars producing the Cry3A toxin); Bt-Xtra®, NatureGard®, KnockOut®, BiteGard®, Protecta®, Bt11 (e.g. Agrisure® CB) and Bt176 from Syngenta Seeds SAS, France, (corn cultivars producing the Cry1Ab toxin and PAT enyzme), MIR604 from Syngenta Seeds SAS, France (corn cultivars producing a modified version of the Cry3A toxin, c.f. WO 03/018810), MON 863 from Monsanto Europe S.A., Belgium (corn cultivars producing the Cry3Bb1 toxin), IPC 531 from Monsanto Europe S.A., Belgium (cotton cultivars producing a modified version of the Cry1Ac toxin) and 1507 from Pioneer Overseas Corporation, Belgium (corn cultivars producing the Cry1F toxin and PAT enzyme). Furthermore, plants are also covered that are by the use of recombinant DNA techniques capable to synthesize one or more proteins to increase the resistance or tolerance of those plants to bacterial, viral or fungal pathogens. Examples of such proteins are the so-called “pathogenesis-related proteins” (PR proteins, see, e.g. EP-A 392 225), plant disease resistance genes (e.g. potato cultivars, which express resistance genes acting against Phytophthora infestans derived from the mexican wild potato Solanum bulbocastanum) or T4-lyso-zym (e.g. potato cultivars capable of synthesizing these proteins with increased resistance against bacteria such as Erwinia amylvora). The methods for producing such genetically modified plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, e.g. in the publications mentioned above. Furthermore, plants are also covered that are by the use of recombinant DNA techniques capable to synthesize one or more proteins to increase the productivity (e.g. bio mass production, grain yield, starch content, oil content or protein content), tolerance to drought, salinity or other growth-limiting environ-mental factors or tolerance to pests and fungal, bacterial or viral pathogens of those plants. Furthermore, plants are also covered that contain by the use of recombinant DNA techniques a modified amount of substances of content or new substances of content, specifically to improve human or animal nutrition, e.g. oil crops that produce health-promoting long-chain omega-3 fatty acids or unsaturated omega-9 fatty acids (e.g. Nexera® rape, DOW Agro Sciences, Canada). Furthermore, plants are also covered that contain by the use of recombinant DNA techniques a modified amount of substances of content or new substances of content, specifically to improve raw material production, e.g. potatoes that produce increased amounts of amylopectin (e.g. Amflora® potato, BASF SE, Germany). Furthermore, it has been found that the composition and method according to the invention are also suitable for the defoliation and/or desiccation of plant parts, for which crop plants such as cotton, potato, oilseed rape, sunflower, soybean or field beans, in particular cotton, are suitable. In this regard compositions have been found for the desiccation and/or defoliation of plants, processes for preparing these compositions, and methods for desiccating and/or defoliating plants using the composition and method according to the invention. As desiccants, the composition and method according to the invention are suitable in particular for desiccating the above-ground parts of crop plants such as potato, oilseed rape, sunflower and soybean, but also cereals. This makes possible the fully mechanical harvesting of these important crop plants. Also of economic interest is the facilitation of harvesting, which is made possible by concentrating within a certain period of time the dehiscence, or reduction of adhesion to the tree, in citrus fruit, olives and other species and varieties of pomaceous fruit, stone fruit and nuts. The same mechanism, i.e. the promotion of the development of abscission tissue between fruit part or leaf part and shoot part of the plants is also essential for the controlled defoliation of useful plants, in particular cotton. Moreover, a shortening of the time interval in which the individual cotton plants mature leads to an increased fiber quality after harvesting. The composition and method according to the invention are applied to the plants mainly by spraying the leaves. Here, the application can be carried out using, for example, water as carrier by customary spraying techniques using spray liquor amounts of from about 100 to 1000 l/ha (for example from 300 to 400 l/ha). The herbicidal compositions may also be applied by the low-volume or the ultra-low-volume method, or in the form of microgranules. The composition and method according to the invention can be applied pre- or post-emergence, or together with the seed of a crop plant. It is also possible to apply the compounds and compositions by applying seed, pretreated with a composition of the invention, of a crop plant. If the active compounds A and C and, if appropriate C, are less well tolerated by certain crop plants, application techniques may be used in which the herbicidal compositions are sprayed, with the aid of the spraying equipment, in such a way that as far as possible they do not come into contact with the leaves of the sensitive crop plants, while the active compounds reach the leaves of undesirable plants growing underneath, or the bare soil surface (post-directed, lay-by). In a further embodiment, the composition or method according to the invention can be applied by treating seed. The treatment of seed comprises essentially all procedures familiar to the person skilled in the art (seed dressing, seed coating, seed dusting, seed soaking, seed film coating, seed multilayer coating, seed encrusting, seed dripping and seed pelleting) based on the composition and method according to the invention. Here, the herbicidal compositions can be applied diluted or undiluted. The term seed comprises seed of all types, such as, for example, corns, seeds, fruits, tubers, seedlings and similar forms. Here, preferably, the term seed describes corns and seeds. The seed used can be seed of the useful plants mentioned above, but also the seed of trans-genic plants or plants obtained by customary breeding methods. The rates of application of the active compound are from 0.0001 to 3.0, preferably 0.01 to 1.0 kg/ha of active substance (a.s.), depending on the control target, the season, the target plants and the growth stage. To treat the seed, the pesticides are generally employed in amounts of from 0.001 to 10 kg per 100 kg of seed. Moreover, it may be advantageous to apply the compositions of the present invention on their own or jointly in combination with other crop protection agents, for example with agents for controlling pests or phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria or with groups of active compounds which regulate growth. Also of interest is the miscibility with mineral salt solutions which are employed for treating nutritional and trace element deficiencies. Non-phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates can also be added. The composition according to the invention can be converted into customary types of agrochemical compositions, e.g. solutions, emulsions, suspensions, dusts, powders, pastes and granules. The composition type depends on the particular intended purpose; in each case, it should ensure a fine and uniform distribution of the compound according to the invention. Examples for composition types are suspensions (SC, OD, FS), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), emulsions (EW, EO, ES), pastes, pastilles, wettable powders or dusts (WP, SP, SS, WS, DP, DS) or granules (GR, FG, GG, MG), which can be water-soluble or wettable, as well as gel formulations for the treatment of plant propagation materials such as seeds (GF). Usually the composition types (e.g. SC, OD, FS, EC, WG, SG, WP, SP, SS, WS, GF) are employed diluted. Composition types such as DP, DS, GR, FG, GG and MG are usually used undiluted. The compositions are prepared in a known manner. When the agrochemical composition is an aqueous composition, the salt according to the invention may dissociate into anions and cations.

The application forms depend entirely on the intended purposes; it is intended to ensure in each case the finest possible distribution of the active substances according to the invention. Aqueous application forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, pastes or wettable powders (sprayable powders, oil dispersions) by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of a wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. Alternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance, wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and such concentrates are suitable for dilution with water. The active substance concentrations in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied within relatively wide ranges. In general, they are from 0.0001 to 10%, preferably from 0.001 to 1% by weight of active substance. The active substances may also be used successfully in the ultra-low-volume process (ULV), it being possible to apply compositions comprising over 95% by weight of active substance, or even to apply the active substance without additives. When employed in plant protection, the amounts of active substances, e.g. the herbicidal salt, applied are, depending on the kind of effect desired, from 0.001 to 5 kg per ha, preferably from 0.005 to 2 kg per ha, more preferably from 0.05 to 0.9 kg per ha, in particular from 0.1 to 0.75 kg per ha.

Amounts customarily applied in the protection of materials are, e.g., 0.001 g to 2 kg, preferably 0.005 g to 1 kg, of active substance per cubic meter of treated material. Various types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, herbicides, bactericides, other fungicides and/or pesticides may be added to the active substances or the compositions comprising them, if appropriate not until immediately prior to use (tank mix). These agents can be admixed with the compositions according to the invention in a weight ratio of 1:100 to 100:1, preferably 1:10 to 10:1. Adjuvants which can be used are in particular organic modified polysiloxanes such as Break Thru S 240®; alcohol alkoxylates such as Atplus 245®, Atplus MBA 1303®, Plurafac LF 300® and Lutensol ON 30®; EO/PO block polymers, e.g. Pluronic RPE 2035® and Genapol B®; alcohol ethoxylates such as Lutensol XP 80®; and dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium such as Leophen RA®. The pesticide can also be present together with other active substances, e.g. with herbicides, insecticides, growth regulators, fungicides or else with fertilizers, as pre-mix or, if appropriate, not until immediately prior to use (tank mix). The present invention also relates to a method for preparing the composition according to the invention comprising the step of contacting the auxin-herbicide and the adjuvant. They may be combined either neatly or in its available formulation, for example, dry or solid formulations, as well as liquid formulations such as aqueous formulations. Preferably, the auxin-herbicide and the adjuvant are contacted in water. The water may be removed after the combining for isolation of the herbicidal salt. The combination may be done at usual temperature such as from −20° C. to 100° C., preferably from 3° C. to 90° C. The present invention also relates to a method of combating harmful insects and/or phytopathogenic fungi, which comprises contacting plants, seed, soil or habitat of plants in or on which the harmful insects and/or phytopathogenic fungi are growing or may grow, plants, seed or soil to be protected from attack or infestation by said harmful insects and/or phytopathogenic fungi with an effective amount of the composition according to the invention. The anionic pesticides comprises usually an insecticide and/or an fungicide. For example, for combating harmful insects the agrochemical formulation comprises an insecticide. For example, for combating phytopathogenic fungi the agrochemical formulation comprises a fungicide. The present invention further relates to a method of controlling undesired vegetation, which comprises allowing a herbicidal effective amount of the composition according to the invention to act on plants, their habitat or on seed of said plants. In a preferred embodiment, the method may also include plants that have been rendered tolerant to the application of the agrochemical formulation wherein the anionic pesticide is a herbicide. The methods generally involve applying an effective amount of the agrochemical formulation of the invention comprising a selected herbicide to a cultivated area or crop field containing one or more crop plants which are tolerant to the herbicide. Although any undesired vegetation may be controlled by such methods, in some embodiments, the methods may involve first identifying undesired vegetation in an area or field as susceptible to the selected herbicide. Methods are provided for controlling the undesired vegetation in an area of cultivation, preventing the development or the appearance of undesired vegetation in an area of cultivation, producing a crop, and increasing crop safety. Undesired vegetation, in the broadest sense, is understood as meaning all those plants which grow in locations where they are undesired, which include but is not limited to plant species generally regarded as weeds. In addition, undesired vegetation can also include undesired crop plants that are growing in an identified location. For example, a volunteer maize plant that is in a field that predominantly comprises soybean plants can be considered undesirable. Undesired plants that can be controlled by the methods of the present invention include those plants that were previously planted in a particular field in a previous season, or have been planted in an adjacent area, and include crop plants including soybean, corn, canola, cotton, sunflowers, and the like. In some aspects, the crop plants can be tolerant of herbicides, such as glyphosate, ALS-inhibitors, or glufosinate herbicides. The methods comprise planting the area of cultivation with crop plants which are tolerant to the herbicide, and in some embodiments, applying to the crop, seed, weed, undesired plant, soil, or area of cultivation thereof an effective amount of an herbicide of interest. The herbicide can be applied at any time during the cultivation of the tolerant plants. The herbicide can be applied before or after the crop is planted in the area of cultivation. Also provided are methods of controlling glyphosate tolerant weeds or crop plants in a cultivated area comprising applying an effective amount of herbicide other than glyphosate to a cultivated area having one or more plants that are tolerant to the other herbicide. The term “herbicidal effective amount” denotes an amount of pesticidal active component, such as the salts or the further pesticide, which is sufficient for controlling undesired vegetation and which does not result in a substantial damage to the treated plants. Such an amount can vary in a broad range and is dependent on various factors, such as the species to be controlled, the treated cultivated plant or material, the climatic conditions and the specific pesticidal active component used. The term “controlling weeds” refers to one or more of inhibiting the growth, germination, reproduction, and/or proliferation of; and/or killing, removing, destroying, or otherwise diminishing the occurrence and/or activity of a weed and/or undesired plant. The composition or method according to the invention has excellent herbicidal activity against a broad spectrum of economically important monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous harmful plants, such as broad-leaved weeds, weed grasses or Cyperaceae. The active compounds also act efficiently on perennial weeds which produce shoots from rhizomes, root stocks and other perennial organs and which are difficult to control. Specific examples may be mentioned of some representatives of the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed flora which can be controlled by the composition or method according to the invention, without the enumeration being restricted to certain species. Examples of weed species on which the herbicidal compositions act efficiently are, from amongst the monocotyledonous weed species, Avena spp., Alopecurus spp., Apera spp., Brachiaria spp., Bromus spp., Digitaria spp., Lolium spp., Echinochloa spp., Leptochloa spp., Fimbristylis spp., Panicum spp., Phalaris spp., Poa spp., Setaria spp. and also Cyperus species from the annual group, and, among the perennial species, Agropyron, Cynodon, Imperata and Sorghum and also perennial Cyperus species. In the case of the dicotyledonous weed species, the spectrum of action extends to genera such as, for example, Abutilon spp., Amaranthus spp., Chenopodium spp., Chrysanthemum spp., Galium spp., Ipomoea spp., Kochia spp., Lamium spp., Matricaria spp., Pharbitis spp., Polygonum spp., Sida spp., Sinapis spp., Solanum spp., Stellaria spp., Veronica spp. Eclipta spp., Sesbania spp., Aeschynomene spp. and Viola spp., Xanthium spp. among the annuals, and Convolvulus, Cirsium, Rumex and Artemisia in the case of the perennial weeds. The present invention further relates to seed comprising the composition according to the invention. Preferably, the seed is coated with an agrochemical formulation comprising the composition according to the invention. The present invention further relates to a use of the adjuvant as defined above for enhancing the performance of a pesticide as defined above. Preferably, the biological activity is enhanced. In another preferred embodiment, the volatility of the pesticide is reduced. The present invention offers various advantages: The method and the composition according to the invention results in a low volatility of the pesticide. Further on, the composition according to the invention is easily prepared starting from cheap, industrially available compounds, which are easy to handle. The pesticidal activity remains at a level equivalent to known salts or the free acid of the pesticide. The invention reduces off-target crop injury due to the reduced volatility, even without adversely affecting the pesticidal activity. The low volatility characteristics are maintained whether delivered as a tank mix or pre-mix formulation. Further on, the invention increases the physical stability of the composition, e.g. by reducing the tendency to crystallize or the tendency for phase separation. The guanidine of the formula (A) is available in industrial scale, is has a very low toxicity to humans, animals and the environment and a very low phytotoxicity. The invention is further illustrated but not limited by the following examples. EXAMPLES Example 1 SL Formulation 5.9 g Guanidine is added under stirring at room temperature to a suspension of 22.1 g dicamba (free acid) in 200 ml water. The resulting solution may be used as SL formulation or optionally further auxiliaries may be added. Example 2 Herbicidal Salt In order to prepare a herbicidal salt of dicamba and guanidine, the water from the aqueous solution of Example 1 (without auxiliaries) is removed under vacuum at room temperature. The guanidinium salt of dicamba is isolated in high yield and purity. Example 3 SL Formulation 13.9 g Triazabicyclodecene (1,5,7-Triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene or TBD) is added under stirring at room temperature to a suspension of 22.1 g dicamba (free acid) in 200 ml water. The resulting solution may be used as SL formulation or optionally further auxiliaries may be added. Example 4 Tankmix 0.2 L of a SL formulation containing 22.1 g dicamba (free acid) are diluted at room temperature with 20 L of water to prepare a sprayable tank mix. To these 20.2 L of tank mix 5.9 g guanidine is added while stirring. Example 5 Tankmix 0.2 L of a SL formulation containing 22.1 g dicamba (free acid) are diluted at room temperature with 80 L of water to prepare a sprayable tank mix. To these 80.2 L of tank mix 13.9 g triazabicyclodecene is added while stirring. Example 6 Volatility Soybeans are grown in pots to 1st trifoliate unfolded and 2nd trifoliate slightly expanded (approx 10 days from planting until ready for treatment). Two plants are placed in each treatment replicate, each consisting of a tray with 8 glass petri dishes (8×9 cm). The roots growing out of the pots are trimmed before placing in trays to avoid contact with petri dishes or volatility exposure. The trays with the petri dishes are treated with 4480 g dicamba acid equivalents/ha (based on SL formulation of Example 1 or 3, or the tank mix of Example 4) and immediately cover with plastic dome. Next, the dome cover are quickly removed and two soybean plants are placed in the middle of each tray. A new dome cover is immediately used and fixed with binder clips at each end to hold dome on tray. A thermometer is included in the trays to monitor temperature. The dome tray units are covered with shade cloth if the temperature rises above 35° C. The percentage of injury (epinasty, cupping and growth reduction) is assessed 2, 7, 14, and 21 days later. For comparison, dicamba free acid or Banvel® (SL formulation of dicamba salt of dimethylamine (watersoluble concentrate 480 g/l, commercially available from Syngenta) are used at the same active dose rate instead of the dicamba salt from Example 3. The dicamba salts according to the invention result in clearly less percentage of injury to the soybeans compared to the dicamba free acid or Banvel®. 1.
