DEVICE FOR PREPARING BEVERAGES Field of the invention The present invention relates to a small machine for preparing beverages from soluble beverage ingredients. Background of the invention Many beverages are manually prepared by mixing a soluble beverage ingredient, usually a soluble powder, with hot or cold water. Various beverages can be prepared from such instant soluble powders like coffee, coffee with milk, tea, chocolate, soup, ... Usually the preparation of the beverage consists in pouring a dose of ingredient in a cup, adding water and optionally stirring the beverage with a spoon. For all these powders, it is important to get a good dissolution of the powder and that no lump appears in the final beverage. The dissolution should also happen as rapidly as possible. Moreover, for some of these beverages and in particular coffee, the final beverage should present a particular visual aspect like the presence of a crema layer for an espresso coffee or the presence of a milk foam for a cappuccino beverage. Yet it is not possible to create a high quality crema by stirring soluble coffee in water with a spoon. Usually stirring mixes of coffee, milk and sugar with a spoon just creates bubbles but not a nice foam. Indeed the visual quality of the cup depends on the smoothness of the crema or foam, its refinement and its velvet-like aspect. It is usually not possible to get such qualities by manual stirring. Usually to reach the above objectives it is current to introduce additives in the soluble beverage ingredient formula. For example in coffee or cappuccino foam boosters are added. Yet these additives increase the cost of the ingredient and can affect the usual taste of the beverage. Besides, these additives can be perceived as less natural by the consumer. So there is a need for improving the dissolution and the final appearance of beverages prepared from current soluble beverage ingredients. In EP-A1-2 586 345 there is provided a drink machine with an additional unit for mixing a liquid or soluble drink with water or steam and for dispensing the mixture in a cup through a dispensing nozzle. The dispensing nozzle is associated to an obturator controlled by an electric motor or a magnet to close or open the nozzle. The additional unit can be separated from the machine but, in that case, the obturator of the dispensing nozzle cannot be controlled any longer in order to dispense any liquid contained in the additional unit. The aim of the present invention is to propose a device for preparing beverages from soluble beverage ingredients. Summary of the invention According to a first aspect, the invention concerns a device for producing a beverage by mixing a soluble beverage ingredient with a diluent, said device comprising : - a cylindrical chamber comprising : . a floor, a top wall and a sidewall extending upwardly from the floor to the top wall to form a space inside the sidewall, the top wall and the floor wherein the beverage is mixed, the floor comprises an opening through which extends the end of a drive shaft oriented along a longitudinal axis XX', . a mixing device attached to the end of the drive shaft, . an outlet for evacuating the beverage from the mixing chamber positioned at the intersection of the floor and the sidewall, - a beverage dispensing assembly, said assembly comprising : . a tube connected to the outlet of the mixing chamber and essentially oriented along a longitudinal axis YY', . a valve device configured for closing or opening the beverage path in the tube, wherein the longitudinal axis YY' of the tube is inclined relative to the longitudinal axis XX' of the shaft of the mixing chamber according to an angle of at least 10°, preferably at most 60°, more preferably comprised between 20° and 60°, even more preferably between 20° and 30°, one with the other, and wherein the device is configured for orienting either the longitudinal axis XX' of the chamber or the longitudinal axis YY' of the tube essentially vertically by hand. The device of the present invention comprises a mixing chamber in which a dose of beverage ingredient and a dose of diluent can be introduced so that the ingredient dissolves in the diluent and produces a beverage. The mixing chamber presents the general shape of a container with a floor, a top wall and a sidewall connected to the floor extending upwardly from the floor to form a space inside the sidewall and the floor wherein the beverage is prepared. Preferably, the floor of the chamber is flat.The top wall, the floor and the sidewall walls of the container cooperate together to form a close container. As a consequence beverage can be mixed inside with no risk that beverage may leak therefrom. Preferably, the ratio of the height to the diameter of the cylindrical container is of at least 0,7, even more preferably comprised between 1 and 3. Generally the mixing chamber presents an internal volume configured for preparing a beverage for one person, that is to say the volume of a current cup. Nevertheless according to another embodiment the mixing chamber can present a volume configured for producing several beverage portions at the same time. According to the invention the floor of the mixing chamber comprises an opening through which extends the end of a drive shaft oriented along a longitudinal axis XX'. The drive shaft is connected to a device for rotating said shaft. Said device is usually a motor positioned below the mixing chamber. A seal between the shaft and the opening in the floor is generally present to avoid beverage leaking. The opening is usually in the centre of the mixing chamber floor. Yet the opening can be located at a distance from the centre also. Generally the longitudinal axis XX' of the drive shaft corresponds to the longitudinal axis of the mixing chamber. Preferably the end of the drive shaft extends through the opening in the floor of the container so that only the part configured for cooperating with a mixing device extends in the container. Therefore the end of the drive shaft does not extend through the space inside the container. As a consequence, the rest of the shaft does not extend though the container and cleaning of the container remains simple. A mixing device is attached to the end of the drive shaft that extends in the mixing chamber so that the mixing device can rotate. The mixing device usually comprises at least one blade. The blade can present any shape configured for crushing pieces and agitating a beverage. Preferable the blade presents a shape such that when it is rotated it draws a path that is close to the floor and the lower part of the sidewall of the mixing chamber container. Such shape improves breaking of the pellets. Such a shape improves also shearing of the beverage fluid between the surface of the blade and the surface of the container walls leading to an efficient dissolution and eventually the creation of foam or crema depending on the nature of the beverage. Foam or crema formation can also depend on the speed of rotation. The preferred blade extends essentially in parallel to the chamber floor and presents an upright tip at its free end. The mixing device can comprise only one blade or several blades, either identical or different. Preferably the mixing device comprises symmetrical positioned blades in order to avoid vibrations. The blade can be made of metal or of plastic. The blade can present cutting edges. The chamber comprises an outlet for evacuating the beverage from the mixing chamber positioned at the intersection of the floor and the sidewalk It is usually a simple hole at the intersection connected to a downstream pipe. The device of the present invention comprises a beverage dispensing assembly for dispensing the beverage prepared in the mixing chamber. Said assembly comprises a tube connected to the outlet of the mixing chamber, extending downwardly from the outlet and essentially oriented along a longitudinal axis YY'. Consequently the tube is essentially straight. Said longitudinal axis YY' of the tube is inclined relative to the longitudinal axis XX' of the shaft of the mixing chamber according to an angle comprised between 20° and 60°, preferably between 20° and 30°. In general, the diameter of the tube of the beverage dispensing assembly can be comprised between 2 mm and 10 mm. Preferably the tube diameter is dimensioned so that the beverage can evenly flow inside. If the tube diameter is too small, then a beverage with foam - like coffee crema of espresso - can be retained in the mixing chamber. Consequently the beverage dispensed in a receptacle downstream to the outlet tube does not present a nice aspect. On the contrary if the tube diameter is too large, the beverage can flow too rapidly and bubbles can appear in the receptacle when beverage splashes inside. Again the beverage dispensed in a receptacle downstream to the outlet tube would not present a nice aspect. Preferably the tube diameter is about 4 mm for dispensing coffee with a layer of crema like espresso. Preferably the tube diameter is comprised between 4 mm and 8 mm for dispensing a foamed milk-based beverage like a cappuccino. According to the invention the device is configured for orienting essentially vertically either the longitudinal axis XX' of the shaft of the mixing chamber or the longitudinal axis YY' of the tube by hand. The device is configured for being oriented by hand in different positions and at least in two different positions : - a first position wherein the longitudinal axis XX' of the shaft of the mixing chamber is essentially vertical, and - a second position wherein the longitudinal axis YY' of the dispensing tube is essentially vertical. The first position generally corresponds to the orientation of the device during the preparation of the beverage that is to say during mixing. The second position generally corresponds to the orientation of the device during the dispensing of the prepared beverage. Preferably the device of the present invention presents such a size and such a weight that it can be oriented by hand by the consumer. Preferably the device can be hold in the hand of a consumer. The device can present such an external design so that it is obvious to the consumer that the device must be tilted before pouring the beverage in a cup. Preferably the external design of the device, preferably the external housing, indicates the orientation of the tube of the beverage dispensing assembly inside the device so that the consumer is naturally incited to tilt the machine to orientate the beverage outlet vertically when the beverage is dispensed. The external design is generally provided by the external shell of the device. Visual features can be used to incite the consumer to tilt the device when the beverage is poured. These features can be the design of the shell, the visibility of the end of the tube of the beverage dispensing assembly, graphics on the device or a combination of them. According to the preferred embodiment, at rest the longitudinal axis XX' of the mixing chamber is essentially vertically oriented. So when the device is not used and is put down the longitudinal axis XX' of the mixing chamber is essentially vertically oriented. Consequently the consumer can easily pour beverage ingredient and diluent in the device when the device is put down. According to said embodiment, the bottom surface of the device is essentially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis XX' of the chamber. The device of the present invention comprises a valve device configured for closing or opening the beverage path in the tube of the beverage dispensing assembly. Preferably the valve device closes the beverage path in the tube by default. Consequently when the consumer pours beverage ingredient and diluent in the device they cannot flow out from the opening at the bottom of the mixing chamber. Preferably the valve device is in the upstream part of the beverage dispensing assembly. Consequently only a small volume of diluent can enter in the assembly during the beverage preparation ; this would not affect the quality of the final beverage. According to a preferred embodiment, at least a part of the tube of the dispensing assembly is made of a flexible and resilient material and the valve device is a pinching valve. The flexible and resilient material can be silicone rubber or any other material known for its flexible and resilient properties and food agreed. According to the preferred embodiment the outlet pipe is made of at least two parts : - one first part being made of flexible and resilient material and - another rigid part, said rigid part being positioned downstream to the first part. Generally the pinching valve comprises an abutment and at least one element movable between : - a first position wherein said valve pinches the part of the tube made of a flexible and resilient material against the abutment, and - a second position wherein said valve releases the part of the tube made of a flexible and resilient material. The movable element of the pinching valve can be moved between the two positions according to a translation movement or a rotational movement or a combination of these both movements. Usually the pinching valve pinches the tube along a direction perpendicular to the tube - that is a direction essentially perpendicular to the vertical axis. According to a particular embodiment, in the first position the valve can pinch the tube and deform it so that it is less apparent externally. According to one mode the valve device can be manually actuated by the consumer. The device can comprise an actuator like a button or a lever that indirectly moves the pinching valve. According to another mode the valve device can be automatically activated by a controller of the device during the beverage preparation cycle. According to a preferred embodiment the device comprises : - a first button for switching the motor of the drive shaft on, - and a second button for opening the beverage path in the tube of the beverage dispensing assembly. Preferably when at least a part of the tube is made of a flexible and resilient material and the valve device is a pinching valve, said valve pinching and closing the tube by default, then the second button is configured for manually pushing the pinching valve and releasing the pinched portion of the tube. So the device does not need any motor to activate the valve that closes the beverage path in the dispensing tube. The consumer activates the valve manually. An advantage is that the consumer can select the volume of beverage he/she wants to dispense in his/her cup. It also enables the consumer to momently stop the beverage dispensing in order to fill several cups with the same beverage and share the prepared beverage. Preferably the both buttons are separated by a distance such that when the device is held in one hand, then both buttons can be touched by at least one finger, preferably the thumb. Consequently the consumer is able to control the device with one hand during beverage mixing and beverage dispensing : he/she jus has to push one of the buttons. The device enables the customer to customise his/her beverage preparation according to his/her taste. The consumer can select the dose of beverage ingredient and the dose of diluent to be introduced in the mixing chamber. Then he/she can select the time length of mixing by the time length of pressing the first button. Depending on that time length the beverage can be frothed to simply dissolve the beverage ingredient in water or be frothed to produce foam in the beverage. Finally the consumer can select the volume of beverage in the drinking cup by the time length of pressing the second button. According to a preferred embodiment the device of the present invention the top wall of the container is an openable cover. The cover avoids that beverage splashes out of the mixing chamber during the mixing operation. Preferably, the cover is attached to the body of the device or to the top of the mixing chamber. In a particular embodiment, the cover is removable. Preferably the cover comprises a hole so that the mixing chamber remains opened to the atmosphere when the cover is closed. So during beverage mixing air can be incorporated in the beverage and foam can be obtained. Moreover during beverage dispensing the beverage can evenly flow through the dispensing tube without creating undesired big bubbles in the drinking cup. The hole can be designed so as to be opened or closed by the user during the beverage preparation with the aim to avoid beverage overflow during the mixing operation. Preferably the device of the present invention comprises a locking device. This locking device aims to keep the cover closed during beverage preparation. The cover can comprise a security switch which prevents the user from operating the device if the cover is open. The locking device can be a pin, a thread or a bayonet device cooperating with a hole, a thread or a slot respectively in the device. The locking device can also consist in a magnet. The motor of the drive shaft can be energised by a battery. The device can be associated to a docking station in which the device can be plugged to reload the battery. The reload can be achieved via direct electrical connectors, or by induction. The docking station can also be used for plugging a kettle. The kettle aims to heat the water for the preparation of the beverage in the device. According to a particular embodiment, the electrical motor of the drive shaft can be replaced by a manual winding mechanism for rotating the drive shaft. The winding mechanism generally cooperates with the shaft through a gearing and a spring. An inertia wheel can be implemented to ease the manual winding and make the rotating element keep the momentum. According to an embodiment the device can comprise a heating device to heat the beverage in the mixing chamber. The heating device can be positioned on the external sides of the mixing chamber container, for example the heating device can be a heating resistive ring. The heating device can be positioned at the bottom of the mixing chamber container, for example the heating device can be a heating sticks or a serigraphic heating plate. According to a second aspect the invention concerns a process for the preparation of a beverage with a device such as described above wherein the following steps are implemented : a) introducing at least one liquid component in the mixing chamber container, b) mixing the at least one liquid component with the mixing device, c) opening the beverage path and tilting the device by hand so that the longitudinal axis YY' of the tube of the beverage dispensing assembly is essentially vertically oriented and dispensing the beverage in a receptacle. According to one mode in step a) a soluble beverage ingredient is introduced in the mixing chamber container and the at least one liquid component is a diluent. The soluble beverage ingredient can be an instant beverage powder like instant coffee, 3- in-1 powder, milk powder, instant tea, chocolate powder, soup powder. The soluble beverage ingredient can also be a liquid beverage concentrate like a coffee or tea concentrate, beverage syrup, a milk concentrate. Additives like flavours, sweeteners, vitamins, ice cubes (for preparing cold beverages) can be introduced in the mixing chamber with the main soluble beverage ingredient too. The diluent is usually water, but other diluent like milk can be used. Water can be previously heated, for example in a kettle. When a beverage is prepared from a soluble beverage powder and a liquid, the liquid is usually introduced in the mixing chamber container before the powder. Accordingly powder does not pour directly into the outlet tube which could block the outlet or provide a bad in-cup quality beverage. According to another mode, the device can also be used to mix a ready-to-drink beverage with the aim to froth it and introduce air inside. This ready-to-drink beverage is usually milk. The time length of mixing step b) can be controlled to adjust the quantity of crema or foam in the beverage. According to a first variant the time length depends on the time length during which the customer presses the first button. So the user can customise his/her beverage by pressing the mixing button during a certain time. The longer the mixing sequence, the higher the quantity of crema or foam. According to a second variant, the time length is automatically set. This time length could also be varied by adding a potentiometer or a cursor on the device body, which would set the mixing time. According to the preferred embodiment of the process, mixing is stopped before the dispensing step c) is implemented. During step c) the user can press more or less the second button in order to control the flow of beverage in the drinking cup. The cleaning of the device can be achieved by rinsing it under tap water. A sponge can be used if milk is used. In addition, a small brush can be used to clean the inside of the beverage dispensing assembly tube, especially if milk is used. Another way of rinsing the device is to pour water inside the mixing chamber, trigger the mixing, and then pour the rinsing water in a container or a sink. This operation is more efficient with hot water. In the present application the terms "bottom", "top", "lateral", "horizontal", "upwardly", "downwardly" and "vertical" are used to describe the relational positioning of features of the invention. These terms should be understood to refer to the device in its normal orientation when put down as shown for example in Figures 1 to 3. More specifically "bottom" and "top" refers to the common sense of these terms relatively to vertical. As an example a bottom wall is vertically positioned under a top wall. In the present application the terms "essentially vertical" cover orientations presenting an angle with vertical comprised between -10 and 10°. Brief description of the drawings The characteristics and advantages of the invention will be better understood in relation to the following figures, wherein : - Figure 1 is a perspective view of the device of the present invention, - Figure 2 is longitudinal cross section view of the device of Figure 1 , - Figure 3 corresponds to Figure 1 wherein an external part of the device has been made transparent to illustrate the beverage dispensing assembly, - Figures 4a and 4b are views of the beverage dispensing assembly extracted from Figure 3 with different positions of the pinching valve, - Figures 5a-5c illustrate the preparation of a beverage with the device of Figure 1 . Detailed description of the drawings Figure 1 illustrates a device 1 for producing a beverage according to the present invention. The device presents a size such that it can be seized by hand, for example like a bottle. The device presents a cover 7 that can be opened by unlocking a cover locking device 72 in order to introduce beverage ingredient and diluent in the device. The device presents two buttons 4, 6 for activating the preparation and the dispensing of the beverage. The buttons are positioned so that once the device is seized by hand, then the thumb can subsequently push one of the buttons. The upper button 4 enables the preparation of the beverage from the ingredient and the diluent introduced in the device by mixing. The lower button 6 enables the dispensing of the prepared beverage through the pipe 31 inside a drinking receptacle (not represented). Figure 2 is a cross section of the device of Figure 1 illustrating the different internal elements of the device. The device comprises a mixing chamber comprising a mixing container 2 in which the beverage can be prepared. The container 2 comprises a floor 21 and a sidewall 22 extending upwardly from the floor to form a space inside the sidewall and the floor wherein the beverage is mixed. Preferably the floor is flat and the cross section of the side wall is circular, the container forming a cylindrical container. The floor comprises a central opening 23 through which extends a drive shaft 24 oriented along a longitudinal axis XX'. A blade 25 is attached to the drive shaft. Preferably the blade presents a shape so as to implement an efficient mixing of a liquid inside the container 2. The shaft extends under the chamber floor 21 and is connected at its lower end to a motor 5. The motor is energised by a battery 51. An internal electric circuit (not represented) enables the activation of the motor by the first button 4. The mixing chamber comprises an outlet 26 for evacuating the beverage from the container 2. The outlet is positioned at the intersection of the floor 21 and the sidewall 22. The device comprises a beverage dispensing assembly for dispensing the beverage from the mixing chamber outlet 26 inside a drinking receptacle. This assembly comprises a tube 31 connected to the outlet 26 of the mixing chamber and essentially oriented along a longitudinal axis YY'. The tube 31 can be composed of different tubular parts : for example, as illustrated in Figure 3, the upstream part of the tube is made : - of a first tube 31 a protruding from the chamber container material, - of a second tube 33 made of a flexible and resilient material which cooperates with a valve device as explained hereunder, and - of a third tube 31 b. The longitudinal axis XX' of the shaft of the mixing chamber and the longitudinal axis YY' of the tube 31 make an angle a of about 30° in the illustrated device. This angle usually presents a value greater than 10° and preferably of at most 30°. This angle value usually depends on the volume of the motor 5 and the position of the mixing chamber outlet 26 relative to said volume of the motor. Due to the position of the motor 5 under the chamber, the outlet of the chamber cannot be vertically oriented through the floor 21 of the chamber container. Consequently it is inclined relative to the axis XX' of the shaft so that the end of the tube 31 emerges on the side of the motor. This arrangement leads to a device presenting a small foot print compared to a machine where the mixing motor is positioned on the lateral side of the mixing chamber as currently done in the field of mixing chamber for soluble beverages. Figure 2 also illustrates the presence of a hole 71 through the cover 7 so that the mixing chamber remains opened to the atmosphere when the cover is closed. The locking device 72 of the cover is a simple movable stud 73 that can be slid horizontally to enter in a corresponding notch 74 at the top of the internal side wall of the mixing chamber container. A protuberance 75 at the surface of the cover and attached to the movable stud 73 enables the consumer to move the stud and lock or unlock the cover. Preferably the movable stud 73 cooperates with a security switch so that the blade cannot be activated if the cover is not closed and the movable stud does not contact the switch. This security avoids that the consumer may be injured by the rotating blade or that beverage splashes out of the mixing chamber. The illustrated locking device can be replaced by any other known locking device currently used for locking a cover. In Figure 3 a part of the external shell 8 of the device has been removed to show the valve assembly 32 configured for closing or opening the beverage path in the tube 31 b. This valve assembly 32 is commanded by the button 6 on the side of the device. Figures 4a and 4b are view of the valve assembly 32 extracted from the device of Figure 3. In Figure 4a the valve assembly 32 is in the position where a force F is exerted upon the button 6 from the right to the left and consequently the valve assembly 32 is in the dispensing position. The valve assembly 32 is a pinching valve configured for being able to pinch the part 33 of the tube made of a flexible and resilient material. The valve assembly 32 comprises a movable pinching element 32a having a U-shape part in which the part 33 of the tube is positioned. Due to the movement of the pinching element 32a the U-shape part can either simply surround the part 33 of the tube or clamp said part of the tube and consequently enable beverage path opening or beverage path closure respectively. The movable pinching element 32a is able to slide inside a cavity of the valve assembly body 32c that holds said pinching element. One first end of the movable pinching element 32a cooperates with the button 6 for activating the dispensing of the beverage. A spring 32b - or any other resilient means - is positioned in the cavity of the valve assembly body 32c and cooperate with a second end of the movable pinching element 32a. The spring 32b is permanently compressed so that by default it pushes the movable pinching element 32a and so the U-shape part of said movable pinching element clamp the resilient part 33 of the tube. The pressure can be relieved by exerting a counter pressure on the movable pinching element 32a by means of the button 6 as illustrated in Figure 4a. In Figure 4b no pressure is exerted on the button 6 : then the spring pushes the movable pinching element 32a which compresses the flexible and resilient part 33 of the tube. Figures 5a to 5c illustrates the method for preparing a beverage with the device 1 according to the present invention. Firstly, in Figure 5a, a beverage ingredient 12 and a diluent 13 are introduced in the mixing chamber of which cover 7 has been opened. The consumer is free to choose the dose of diluent and the dose of ingredient he/she desires according to his/her personal taste. During this step the device 1 is generally put down on a surface 1 1 with its cover opened which makes dosing easy for the consumer. Then as illustrated in Figure 5b the cover is closed and the customer can seize the machine in his/her hand in order to press button 4 and activate the rotation of the blade and the preparation of the beverage. During this step the customer is free to select the length time of the mixing and consequently the production of more or less froth in the beverage. Finally as illustrated in Figure 5c the consumer can dispense the beverage 10 in a drinking cup 9 : he/she presses the button 6 for opening the valve of the beverage dispensing assembly and simultaneously tilt the device so that the longitudinal axis YY' of the dispensing tube is essentially vertical. This orientation of the device during the dispensing is rather natural for the consumer since the end of the tube 31 is apparent for the consumer due to the particular design of the shell of the device : in the illustrated device a recess 81 makes the orientation of the beverage outlet clearly apparent : consequently the user can instinctively orientate the tube 31 essentially vertically to pour the beverage in a drinking cup 9.

Another advantage of the device is that it presents a small size and a small foot print: it is small accessory. Another advantage of the device is that it enables the customisation of the beverage by the consumer in terms of presence of foam or froth in the beverage. Another advantage of the present invention is that coffee crema and milk foam created by the device enhances the taste and perception of the beverage quality. 1.
