CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/305,900, filed Feb. 18, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Neurotransmitters such as histamine, serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine mediate a large number of processes in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as outside the CNS. Abnormal neurotransmitter levels are associated with a wide variety of diseases and conditions including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's Disease, autism, Guillain-Barré syndrome, mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia (such as cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS), positive symptoms, disorganized symptoms, and negative symptoms of schizophrenia), anxiety, multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, bipolar disorders, psychosis, depression, attention-deficit disorder (ADD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and a variety of allergic diseases. Compounds that modulate these neurotransmitters may be useful therapeutics. Histamine receptors belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled seven transmembrane proteins. G protein-coupled receptors constitute one of the major signal transduction systems in eukaryotic cells. Coding sequences for these receptors, in those regions believed to contribute to the agonist-antagonist binding site, are strongly conserved across mammalian species. Histamine receptors are found in most peripheral tissue and within the central nervous system. Compounds capable of modulating a histamine receptor may find use in therapy, e.g., histamine antagonists may find use as antihistamines. Dimebon is a known anti-histamine drug that has also been characterized as a neuroprotective agent useful to treat, inter alia, neurodegenerative diseases. Dimebon has been shown to inhibit the death of brain cells (neurons) in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease, making it a novel potential treatment for these and other neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, dimebon has been shown to improve the mitochondrial function of cells in the setting of cellular stress with very high potency. For example, dimebon treatment improved mitochondrial function and increased the number of surviving cells after treatment with the cell toxin ionomycin in a dose dependent fashion. Dimebon has also been shown to promote neurite outgrowth and neurogenesis, processes important in the formation of new and/or enhanced neuronal cell connections, and evidence of dimebon's potential for use in additional diseases or conditions. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,187,785 and 7,071,206 and PCT Patent Application Nos. PCT/US2004/041081, PCT/US2007/020483, PCT/US2006/039077, PCT/US2008/077090, PCT/US2007/020516, PCT/US2007/022645, PCT/US2007/002117, PCT/US2008/006667, PCT/US2007/024626, PCT/US2008/009357, PCT/US2007/024623 and PCT/US2008/008121. Hydrogenated pyrido[4,3-b]indoles and uses thereof have been disclosed in PCT Patent Application Nos. PCT/US2008/081390, PCT/US2009/032065 and PCT/US2009/038142. Hydrogenated pyrido[3,4-b]indoles and uses thereof have been described in PCT/US2009/038138. Azepino[4,5-b]indoles and uses thereof have been described in PCT/US2009/062872. All references disclosed herein and throughout, such as publications, patents, patent applications and published patent applications, are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Although dimebon holds great promise as a drug for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and/or diseases in which neurite outgrowth and/or neurogenesis may be implicated in therapy, there remains a need for new and alternative therapies for the treatment of such diseases or conditions. In addition, there remains a need for new and alternative antihistamine drugs, preferably ones in which side-effects such as drowsiness are reduced or eliminated. Compounds that exhibit enhanced and/or more desirable properties than dimebon (e.g., superior safety and efficacy) may find particular use in the treatment of at least those indications for which dimebon is believed to be advantageous. Further, compounds that exhibit a different therapeutic profile than dimebon as determined, e.g., by in vitro and/or in vivo assays, may find use in additional diseases and conditions.

As used herein, “delaying” development of a disease or condition means to defer, hinder, slow, retard, stabilize and/or postpone development of the disease or condition. This delay can be of varying lengths of time, depending on the history of the disease and/or individual being treated. As is evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant delay can, in effect, encompass prevention, in that the individual does not develop the disease or condition. For example, a method that “delays” development of Alzheimer's disease is a method that reduces probability of disease development in a given time frame and/or reduces extent of the disease in a given time frame, when compared to not using the method. Such comparisons are typically based on clinical studies, using a statistically significant number of subjects. For example, Alzheimer's disease development can be detected using standard clinical techniques, such as routine neurological examination, patient interview, neuroimaging, detecting alterations of levels of specific proteins in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid (e.g., amyloid peptides and Tau), computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Similar techniques are known in the art for other diseases and conditions. Development may also refer to disease progression that may be initially undetectable and includes occurrence, recurrence and onset. As used herein, an “at risk” individual is an individual who is at risk of developing a cognitive disorder, a psychotic disorder, a neurotransmitter-mediated disorder and/or a neuronal disorder that can be treated with a compound of the invention. An individual “at risk” may or may not have a detectable disease or condition, and may or may not have displayed detectable disease prior to the treatment methods described herein. “At risk” denotes that an individual has one or more so-called risk factors, which are measurable parameters that correlate with development of a disease or condition and are known in the art. An individual having one or more of these risk factors has a higher probability of developing the disease or condition than an individual without these risk factor(s). These risk factors include, but are not limited to, age, sex, race, diet, history of previous disease, presence of precursor disease, genetic (i.e., hereditary) considerations, and environmental exposure. For example, individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease include, e.g., those having relatives who have experienced this disease and those whose risk is determined by analysis of genetic or biochemical markers. Genetic markers of risk for Alzheimer's disease include mutations in the APP gene, particularly mutations at position 717 and positions 670 and 671 referred to as the Hardy and Swedish mutations, respectively (Hardy, Trends Neurosci., 20:154-9, 1997). Other markers of risk are mutations in the presenilin genes (e.g., PS1 or PS2), ApoE4 alleles, a family history of Alzheimer's disease, hypercholesterolemia and/or atherosclerosis. Other such factors are known in the art for other diseases and conditions. As used herein, the term “pro-cognitive” includes but is not limited to an improvement of one or more mental processes such as memory, attention, perception and/or thinking, which may be assessed by methods known in the art. As used herein, the term “neurotrophic” effects includes but is not limited to effects that enhance neuron function such as growth, survival and/or neurotransmitter synthesis. As used herein, the term “cognitive disorders” refers to and intends diseases and conditions that are believed to involve or be associated with or do involve or are associated with progressive loss of structure and/or function of neurons, including death of neurons, and where a central feature of the disorder may be the impairment of cognition (e.g., memory, attention, perception and/or thinking). These disorders include pathogen-induced cognitive dysfunction, e.g. HIV associated cognitive dysfunction and Lyme disease associated cognitive dysfunction. Examples of cognitive disorders include Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), autism, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and age-associated memory impairment (AAMI). As used herein, the term “psychotic disorders” refers to and intends mental diseases or conditions that are believed to cause or do cause abnormal thinking and perceptions. Psychotic disorders are characterized by a loss of reality which may be accompanied by delusions, hallucinations (perceptions in a conscious and awake state in the absence of external stimuli which have qualities of real perception, in that they are vivid, substantial, and located in external objective space), personality changes and/or disorganized thinking. Other common symptoms include unusual or bizarre behavior, as well as difficulty with social interaction and impairment in carrying out the activities of daily living. Exemplary psychotic disorders are schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, psychosis, anxiety and depression. As used herein, the term “neurotransmitter-mediated disorders” refers to and intends diseases or conditions that are believed to involve or be associated with or do involve or are associated with abnormal levels of neurotransmitters such as histamine, serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine or impaired function of aminergic G protein-coupled receptors. Exemplary neurotransmitter-mediated disorders include spinal cord injury, diabetic neuropathy, allergic diseases and diseases involving geroprotective activity such as age-associated hair loss (alopecia), age-associated weight loss and age-associated vision disturbances (cataracts). Abnormal neurotransmitter levels are associated with a wide variety of diseases and conditions including, but not limited, to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's Disease, autism, Guillain-Barré syndrome, mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, bipolar disorders, psychosis, depression and a variety of allergic diseases. As used herein, the term “neuronal disorders” refers to and intends diseases or conditions that are believed to involve, or be associated with, or do involve or are associated with neuronal cell death and/or impaired neuronal function or decreased neuronal function. Exemplary neuronal indications include neurodegenerative diseases and disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CCDS), Lewy body disease, Menkes disease, Wilson disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Fahr disease, an acute or chronic disorder involving cerebral circulation, such as ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or other cerebral hemorrhagic insult, age-associated memory impairment (AAMI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), injury-related mild cognitive impairment (MCI), post-concussion syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, adjuvant chemotherapy, traumatic brain injury (TBI), neuronal death mediated ocular disorder, macular degeneration, age-related macular degeneration, autism, including autism spectrum disorder, Asperger syndrome, and Rett syndrome, an avulsion injury, a spinal cord injury, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, neuropathy associated with spinal cord injury, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis, anxiety or depression. As used herein, the term “neuron” represents a cell of ectodermal embryonic origin derived from any part of the nervous system of an animal. Neurons express well-characterized neuron-specific markers, including neurofilament proteins, NeuN (Neuronal Nuclei marker), MAP2, and class III tubulin. Included as neurons are, for example, hippocampal, cortical, midbrain dopaminergic, spinal motor, sensory, sympathetic, septal cholinergic, and cerebellar neurons. As used herein, the term “neurite outgrowth” or “neurite activation” refers to the extension of existing neuronal processes (e.g., axons and dendrites) and the growth or sprouting of new neuronal processes (e.g., axons and dendrites). Neurite outgrowth or neurite activation may alter neural connectivity, resulting in the establishment of new synapses or the remodeling of existing synapses. As used herein, the term “neurogenesis” refers to the generation of new nerve cells from undifferentiated neuronal progenitor cells, also known as multipotential neuronal stem cells. Neurogenesis actively produces new neurons, astrocytes, glia, Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes and/or other neural lineages. Much neurogenesis occurs early in human development, though it continues later in life, particularly in certain localized regions of the adult brain. As used herein, the term “neural connectivity” refers to the number, type, and quality of connections (“synapses”) between neurons in an organism. Synapses form between neurons, between neurons and muscles (a “neuromuscular junction”), and between neurons and other biological structures, including internal organs, endocrine glands, and the like. Synapses are specialized structures by which neurons transmit chemical or electrical signals to each other and to non-neuronal cells, muscles, tissues, and organs. Compounds that affect neural connectivity may do so by establishing new synapses (e.g., by neurite outgrowth or neurite activation) or by altering or remodeling existing synapses. Synaptic remodeling refers to changes in the quality, intensity or type of signal transmitted at particular synapses. As used herein, the term “neuropathy” refers to a disorder characterized by altered function and/or structure of motor, sensory, and autonomic neurons of the nervous system, initiated or caused by a primary lesion or other dysfunction of the nervous system. Patterns of peripheral neuropathy include polyneuropathy, mononeuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex and autonomic neuropathy. The most common form is (symmetrical) peripheral polyneuropathy, which mainly affects the feet and legs. A radiculopathy involves spinal nerve roots, but if peripheral nerves are also involved the term radiculoneuropathy is used. The form of neuropathy may be further broken down by cause, or the size of predominant fiber involvement, e.g., large fiber or small fiber peripheral neuropathy. Central neuropathic pain can occur in spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and some strokes, as well as fibromyalgia. Neuropathy may be associated with varying combinations of weakness, autonomic changes and sensory changes. Loss of muscle bulk or fasciculations, a particular fine twitching of muscle may also be seen. Sensory symptoms encompass loss of sensation and “positive” phenomena including pain. Neuropathies are associated with a variety of disorders, including diabetes (e.g., diabetic neuropathy), fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, and herpes zoster infection, as well as with spinal cord injury and other types of nerve damage. As used herein, the term “Alzheimer's disease” refers to a degenerative brain disorder characterized clinically by progressive memory deficits, confusion, behavioral problems, inability to care for oneself, gradual physical deterioration and, ultimately, death. Histologically, the disease is characterized by neuritic plaques, found primarily in the association cortex, limbic system and basal ganglia. The major constituent of these plaques is amyloid beta peptide (AP), which is the cleavage product of beta amyloid precursor protein (βAPP or APP). APP is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that contains a large ectopic N-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain and a small cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. Alternative splicing of the transcript of the single APP gene on chromosome 21 results in several isoforms that differ in the number of amino acids. Aβ appears to have a central role in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease. Familial forms of the disease have been linked to mutations in APP and the presenilin genes (Tanzi et al, Neurobiol. Dis. 3:159-168, 1996; Hardy, Ann. Med. 28:255-258, 1996). Diseased-linked mutations in these genes result in increased production of the 42-amino acid form of Aβ, the predominant form found in amyloid plaques. Mitochondrial dysfunction has also been reported to be an important component of Alzheimer's disease (Bubber et al, Mitochondrial abnormalities in Alzheimer brain: Mechanistic Implications, Ann. Neurol. 57(5):695-703, 2005; Wang et al, Insights into amyloid-β-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer disease, Free Radical Biology & Medicine 43:1569-1573, 2007; Swerdlow et al, Mitochondria in Alzheimer's disease, Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 53:341-385, 2002; and Reddy et al, Are mitochondria critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease?, Brain Res Rev. 49(3):618-32, 2005). It has been proposed that mitochondrial dysfunction has a causal relationship with neuronal function (including neurotransmitter synthesis and secretion) and viability. Compounds which stabilize mitochondria may therefore have a beneficial impact on Alzheimer's patients. As used herein, the term “Huntington's disease” refers to a fatal neurological disorder characterized clinically by symptoms such as involuntary movements, cognition impairment or loss of cognitive function and a wide spectrum of behavioral disorders. Common motor symptoms associated with Huntington's disease include chorea (involuntary writhing and spasming), clumsiness, and progressive loss of the abilities to walk, speak (e.g., exhibiting slurred speech) and swallow. Other symptoms of Huntington's disease can include cognitive symptoms such as loss of intellectual speed, attention and short-term memory and/or behavioral symptoms that can span the range of changes in personality, depression, irritability, emotional outbursts and apathy. Clinical symptoms typically appear in the fourth or fifth decade of life. Huntington's disease is a devastating and often protracted illness, with death usually occurring approximately 10-20 years after the onset of symptoms. Huntington's disease is inherited through a mutated or abnormal gene encoding an abnormal protein called the mutant huntingtin protein; the mutated huntingtin protein produces neuronal degeneration in many different regions of the brain. The degeneration focuses on neurons located in the basal ganglia, structures deep within the brain that control many important functions including coordinating movement, and on neurons on the outer surface of the brain or cortex, which controls thought, perception and memory. “Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis” or “ALS” is used herein to denote a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects upper motor neurons (motor neurons in the brain) and/or lower motor neurons (motor neurons in the spinal cord) and results in motor neuron death. As used herein, the term “ALS” includes all of the classifications of ALS known in the art, including, but not limited to classical ALS (typically affecting both lower and upper motor neurons), Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS, typically affecting only the upper motor neurons), Progressive Bulbar Palsy (PBP or Bulbar Onset, a version of ALS that typically begins with difficulties swallowing, chewing and speaking), Progressive Muscular Atrophy (PMA, typically affecting only the lower motor neurons) and familial ALS (a genetic version of ALS). The term “Parkinson's disease” as used herein refers to any medical condition wherein an individual experiences one or more symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, such as without limitation one or more of the following symptoms: rest tremor, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, postural reflex impairment, symptoms having good response to 1-dopa treatment, the absence of prominent oculomotor palsy, cerebellar or pyramidal signs, amyotrophy, dyspraxia and/or dysphasia. In a specific embodiment, the present invention is utilized for the treatment of a dopaminergic dysfunction-related disorder. In a specific embodiment, the individual with Parkinson's disease has a mutation or polymorphism in a synuclein, parkin or NURR1 nucleic acid that is associated with Parkinson's disease. In one embodiment, the individual with Parkinson's disease has defective or decreased expression of a nucleic acid or a mutation in a nucleic acid that regulates the development and/or survival of dopaminergic neurons. As used herein, the term “canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome,” or “CCDS” refers to an age-related deterioration of mental function typified by multiple cognitive impairments that affect an afflicted canine's ability to function normally. The decline in cognitive ability that is associated with CCDS cannot be completely attributed to a general medical condition such as neoplasia, infection, sensory impairment, or organ failure. Diagnosis of CCDS in canines, such as dogs, is generally a diagnosis of exclusion, based on thorough behavior and medical histories and the presence of clinical symptoms of CCDS that are unrelated to other disease processes. Owner observation of age-related changes in behavior is a practical means used to detect the possible onset of CCDS in aging domestic dogs. A number of laboratory cognitive tasks may be used to help diagnose CCDS, while blood counts, chemistry panels and urinalysis can be used to rule out other underlying diseases that could mimic the clinical symptoms of CCDS. Symptoms of CCDS include memory loss, which in domestic dogs may be manifested by disorientation and/or confusion, decreased or altered interaction with family members and/or greeting behavior, changes in sleep-wake cycle, decreased activity level, and loss of house training or frequent, inappropriate elimination. A canine suffering from CCDS may exhibit one or more of the following clinical or behavioral symptoms: decreased appetite, decreased awareness of surroundings, decreased ability to recognize familiar places, people or other animals, decreased hearing, decreased ability to climb up and down stairs, decreased tolerance to being alone, development of compulsive behavior or repetitive behaviors or habits, circling, tremors or shaking, disorientation, decreased activity level, abnormal sleep wake cycles, loss of house training, decreased or altered responsiveness to family members, and decreased or altered greeting behavior. CCDS can dramatically affect the health and well-being of an afflicted canine. Moreover, the companionship offered by a pet with CCDS can become less rewarding as the severity of the disease increases and its symptoms become more severe. As used herein, the term “age-associated memory impairment” or “AAMI” refers to a condition that may be identified as GDS stage 2 on the global deterioration scale (GDS) (Reisberg et al, Am. J. Psychiatry 139:1136-1139, 1982) which differentiates the aging process and progressive degenerative dementia in seven major stages. The first stage of the GDS is one in which individuals at any age have neither subjective complaints of cognitive impairment nor objective evidence of impairment. These GDS stage 1 individuals are considered normal. The second stage of the GDS applies to those generally elderly persons who complain of memory and cognitive functioning difficulties such as not recalling names as well as they could five or ten years previously or not recalling where they have placed things as well as they could five or ten years previously. These subjective complaints appear to be very common in otherwise normal elderly individuals. AAMI refers to persons in GDS stage 2, who may differ neurophysiologically from elderly persons who are normal and free of subjective complaints, i.e., GDS stage 1. For example, AAMI subjects have been found to have more electrophysiologic slowing on a computer analyzed EEG than GDS stage 1 elderly persons (Prichep et al, Neurobiol. Aging 15:85-90, 1994). As used herein, the term “mild cognitive impairment” or “MCI” refers to a type of cognitive disorder characterized by a more pronounced deterioration in cognitive functions than is typical for normal age-related decline. As a result, elderly or aged patients with MCI have greater than normal difficulty performing complex daily tasks and learning, but without the inability to perform normal social, everyday, and/or professional functions typical of patients with Alzheimer's disease, or other similar neurodegenerative disorders eventually resulting in dementia. MCI is characterized by subtle, clinically manifest deficits in cognition, memory, and functioning, amongst other impairments, which are not of sufficient magnitude to fulfill criteria for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. MCI also encompasses injury-related MCI, defined herein as cognitive impairment resulting from certain types of injury, such as nerve injury (e.g., battlefield injuries, including post-concussion syndrome, and the like), neurotoxic treatment (e.g., adjuvant chemotherapy resulting in “chemo brain” and the like), and tissue damage resulting from physical injury or other neurodegeneration, which is separate and distinct from mild cognitive impairment resulting from stroke, ischemia, hemorrhagic insult, blunt force trauma, and the like. As used herein, the term “traumatic brain injury” or “TBI” refers to a brain injury caused by a sudden trauma, such as a blow or jolt or a penetrating head injury, which disrupts the function or damages the brain. Symptoms of TBI can range from mild, moderate to severe and can significantly affect many cognitive (deficits of language and communication, information processing, memory, and perceptual skills), physical (ambulation, balance, coordination, fine motor skills, strength, and endurance), and psychological skills. “Neuronal death mediated ocular disease” intends an ocular disease in which death of the neuron is implicated in whole or in part. The disease may involve death of photoreceptors. The disease may involve retinal cell death. The disease may involve ocular nerve death by apoptosis. Particular neuronal death mediated ocular diseases include but are not limited to macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, congenital stationary night blindness (Oguchi disease), childhood onset severe retinal dystrophy, Leber congenital amaurosis, Bardet-Biedle syndrome, Usher syndrome, blindness from an optic neuropathy, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, color blindness and Hansen-Larson-Berg syndrome. As used herein, the term “macular degeneration” includes all forms and classifications of macular degeneration known in the art, including, but not limited to diseases that are characterized by a progressive loss of central vision associated with abnormalities of Bruch's membrane, the choroid, the neural retina and/or the retinal pigment epithelium. The term thus encompasses disorders such as age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) as well as rarer, earlier-onset dystrophies that in some cases can be detected in the first decade of life. Other maculopathies include North Carolina macular dystrophy, Sorsby's fundus dystrophy, Stargardt's disease, pattern dystrophy, Best disease, and Malattia Leventinese. As used herein, the term “autism” refers to a brain development disorder that impairs social interaction and communication and causes restricted and repetitive behavior, typically appearing during infancy or early childhood. The cognitive and behavioral defects are thought to result in part from altered neural connectivity. Autism encompasses related disorders sometimes referred to as “autism spectrum disorder,” as well as Asperger syndrome and Rett syndrome. As used herein, the term “nerve injury” or “nerve damage” refers to physical damage to nerves, such as avulsion injury (e.g., where a nerve or nerves have been torn or ripped) or spinal cord injury (e.g., damage to white matter or myelinated fiber tracts that carry sensation and motor signals to and from the brain). Spinal cord injury can occur from many causes, including physical trauma (e.g., car accidents, sports injuries, and the like), tumors impinging on the spinal column, developmental disorders, such as spina bifida, and the like. As used herein, the term “myasthenia gravis” or “MG” refers to a non-cognitive neuromuscular disorder caused by immune-mediated loss of acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions of skeletal muscle. Clinically, MG typically appears first as occasional muscle weakness in approximately two-thirds of patients, most commonly in the extraocular muscles. These initial symptoms eventually worsen, producing drooping eyelids (ptosis) and/or double vision (diplopia), often causing the patient to seek medical attention. Eventually, many patients develop general muscular weakness that may fluctuate weekly, daily, or even more frequently. Generalized MG often affects muscles that control facial expression, chewing, talking, swallowing, and breathing; before recent advances in treatment, respiratory failure was the most common cause of death. As used herein, the term “Guillain-Barré syndrome” refers to a non-cognitive disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. The first symptoms of this disorder include varying degrees of weakness or tingling sensations in the legs. In many instances the weakness and abnormal sensations spread to the arms and upper body. These symptoms can increase in intensity until certain muscles cannot be used at all and, when severe, the patient is almost totally paralyzed. In these cases the disorder is life threatening—potentially interfering with breathing and, at times, with blood pressure or heart rate—and is considered a medical emergency. Most patients, however, recover from even the most severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, although some continue to have a certain degree of weakness. As used herein, the term “multiple sclerosis” or “MS” refers to an autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (CNS), leading to demyelination of neurons. It may cause numerous symptoms, many of which are non-cognitive, and often progresses to physical disability. MS affects the areas of the brain and spinal cord known as the white matter. White matter cells carry signals between the grey matter areas, where the processing is done, and the rest of the body. More specifically, MS destroys oligodendrocytes which are the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer, known as the myelin sheath, which helps the neurons carry electrical signals. MS results in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and, less frequently, the cutting (transection) of the neuron's extensions or axons. When the myelin is lost, the neurons can no longer effectively conduct their electrical signals. Almost any neurological symptom can accompany the disease. MS takes several forms, with new symptoms occurring either in discrete attacks (relapsing forms) or slowly accumulating over time (progressive forms). Most people are first diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS but develop secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) after a number of years. Between attacks, symptoms may go away completely, but permanent neurological problems often persist, especially as the disease advances. As used herein, the term “schizophrenia” refers to a chronic, mental disorder characterized by one or more positive symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations) and/or negative symptoms (e.g., blunted emotions and lack of interest) and/or disorganized symptoms (e.g., disorganized thinking and speech or disorganized perception and behavior). Schizophrenia as used herein includes all forms and classifications of schizophrenia known in the art, including, but not limited to catatonic type, hebephrenic type, disorganized type, paranoid type, residual type or undifferentiated type schizophrenia and deficit syndrome and/or those described in American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Washington D.C., 2000 or in International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, or otherwise known to those of skill in the art. “Cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia” or “CIAS” includes neuropsychological deficits in attention, working memory, verbal learning, and problem solving. These deficits are believed to be linked to impairment in functional status (e.g., social behavior, work performance, and activities of daily living). As used herein “geroprotective activity” or “geroprotector” means a biological activity that slows down ageing and/or prolongs life and/or increases or improves the quality of life via a decrease in the amount and/or the level of intensity of pathologies or conditions that are not life-threatening but are associated with the aging process and which are typical for elderly people. Pathologies or conditions that are not life-threatening but are associated with the aging process include such pathologies or conditions as loss of sight (cataract), deterioration of the dermatohairy integument (alopecia), and an age-associated decrease in weight due to the death of muscular and/or fatty cells. As used herein, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common child neuropsychiatric condition present in school-aged children, affecting about 5-8% of this population. ADHD refers to a chronic disorder that initially manifests in childhood and is characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention. ADHD is characterized by persistent patterns of inattention and/or impulsivity-hyperactivity that are much more extreme than is observed in individuals at the same developmental level or stage. There is considerable evidence, from family and twin studies, that ADHD has a significant genetic component. This disorder is thought to be due to an interaction of environmental and genetic factors. ADHD includes all known types of ADHD. For example, Diagnostic & Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) identifies three subtypes of ADHD: (1) ADHD, Combined Type which is characterized by both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms; (2) ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type which is characterized by inattention but not hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms; and (3) ADHD, Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type which is characterized by Hyperactivity-impulsivity but not inattention symptoms. As used herein, attention-deficit disorder (ADD) refers to a disorder in processing neural stimuli that is characterized by distractibility and impulsivity that can result in inability to control behavior and can impair an individual's social, academic, or occupational function and development. ADD may be diagnosed by known methods, which may include observing behavior and diagnostic interview techniques. As used herein “allergic disease” refers to a disorder of the immune system which is characterized by excessive activation of mast cells and basophils and production of IgE immunoglobulins, resulting in an extreme inflammatory response. It represents a form of hypersensitivity to an environmental substance known as allergen and is an acquired disease. Common allergic reactions include eczema, hives, hay fever, asthma, food allergies, and reactions to the venom of stinging insects such as wasps and bees. Allergic reactions are accompanied by an excessive release of histamines, and can thus be treated with antihistaminic agents. As used herein, by “combination therapy” is meant a therapy that includes two or more different compounds. Thus, in one aspect, a combination therapy comprising a compound detailed herein and anther compound is provided. In some variations, the combination therapy optionally includes one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients, non-pharmaceutically active compounds, and/or inert substances. In various embodiments, treatment with a combination therapy may result in an additive or even synergistic (e.g., greater than additive) result compared to administration of a single compound of the invention alone. In some embodiments, a lower amount of each compound is used as part of a combination therapy compared to the amount generally used for individual therapy. Preferably, the same or greater therapeutic benefit is achieved using a combination therapy than by using any of the individual compounds alone. In some embodiments, the same or greater therapeutic benefit is achieved using a smaller amount (e.g., a lower dose or a less frequent dosing schedule) of a compound in a combination therapy than the amount generally used for individual compound or therapy. Preferably, the use of a small amount of compound results in a reduction in the number, severity, frequency, and/or duration of one or more side-effects associated with the compound. As used herein, the term “effective amount” intends such amount of a compound of the invention which in combination with its parameters of efficacy and toxicity, as well as based on the knowledge of the practicing specialist should be effective in a given therapeutic form. As is understood in the art, an effective amount may be in one or more doses, e.g., a single dose or multiple doses may be required to achieve the desired treatment endpoint. An effective amount may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable or beneficial result may be or is achieved. Suitable doses of any of the co-administered compounds may optionally be lowered due to the combined action (e.g., additive or synergistic effects) of the compounds. As used herein, “unit dosage form” refers to physically discrete units, suitable as unit dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Unit dosage forms may contain a single or a combination therapy. As used herein, the term “controlled release” refers to a drug-containing formulation or fraction thereof in which release of the drug is not immediate, e.g., with a “controlled release” formulation, administration does not result in immediate release of the drug into an absorption pool. The term encompasses depot formulations designed to gradually release the drug compound over an extended period of time. Controlled release formulations can include a wide variety of drug delivery systems, generally involving mixing the drug compound with carriers, polymers or other compounds having the desired release characteristics (e.g., pH-dependent or non-pH-dependent solubility, different degrees of water solubility, and the like) and formulating the mixture according to the desired route of delivery (e.g., coated capsules, implantable reservoirs, injectable solutions containing biodegradable capsules, and the like). As used herein, by “pharmaceutically acceptable” or “pharmacologically acceptable” is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, e.g., the material may be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition administered to a patient without causing any significant undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the composition in which it is contained. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients have preferably met the required standards of toxicological and manufacturing testing and/or are included on the Inactive Ingredient Guide prepared by the U.S. Food and Drug administration. “Pharmaceutically acceptable salts” are those salts which retain at least some of the biological activity of the free (non-salt) compound and which can be administered as drugs or pharmaceuticals to an individual. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt intends ionic interactions and not a covalent bond. As such, an N-oxide is not considered a salt. Such salts, for example, include: (1) acid addition salts, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid and the like; (2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth metal ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base. Acceptable organic bases include ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine and the like. Acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like. Further examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those listed in Berge et al, Pharmaceutical Salts, J. Pharm. Sci. 66(1):1-19, 1977. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared in situ in the manufacturing process, or by separately reacting a purified compound of the invention in its free acid or base form with a suitable organic or inorganic base or acid, respectively, and isolating the salt thus formed during subsequent purification. It should be understood that a reference to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt includes the solvent addition forms or crystal forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are often formed during the process of crystallization. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate.

General Method 3. Alcohol compounds of type 3-C can be prepared from the bromo precursor 3-A by treatment with epoxide 3-B under standard Grignard or Grignard-cuprate coupling conditions known to those skilled in the art. Fluorination of 3-C with agents such as Diethylaminosulfur-trifluoride (DAST) provides the fluoro derivative 3-D. Alternatively, treatment of 3-A with alkene 3-E under Heck coupling conditions affords the styryl product of the type 3-F. Alternative coupling conditions including Stille and Suzuki, and the like, using corresponding reagents, will be familiar to those skilled in the art. General Method 4. Condensation of appropriately functionalized 4-hydrazino pyridine E-1 with functionalized azepan-4-ones in step 1 yields the 9-aza-hexahydroazepino[5,4-b]indole intermediate E-2. The indole nitrogen atom at this stage can be functionalized in step 2 with alkyl groups (W) or protected with various protecting groups (PG) known to those skilled in the art to give E-3. Subjecting E-3 to alkyne coupling conditions with triisopropyl (TIPS) acetylene yields the adduct E-4, the TIPS group of which can be cleaved under standard silane-deprotection chemistry to afford alkyne E-5. Oxidation of the triple bond of E-5 in step 5 provides aldehyde E-6, which can be treated in step 6 with an aryl lithium or aryl Grignard reagent to yield the alcohol product E-7. Halo intermediate E-3 can alternatively be treated under aryl coupling conditions such as, for example, the Heck reaction in step 7 to give product E-8, the styrene double bond of which can be hydrated in step 8 to give the tertiary alcohol product E-9. An alternative coupled product to E-4 can be obtained in step 9 through coupling of compound E-9 with appropriately functionalized aryl acetylenes to get alkyne E-10. Although the Scheme depicts phenyl or pyridyl rings in the compounds, it is understood that a number of aromatic and heteroaromatic analogs are conceivable for such synthetic routes, including but not limited to pyrimidine, pyrazine, thiophene, furan, pyrrolo, imidazole, thiazole, and the like. Similarly, the point of attachment of groups such as R′ to the aromatic or heteroaromatic groups can be envisioned in a variety of chemically feasible locations. All possible attachment locations of functional groups on the aromatic ring(s) should be considered. General Method 5. Condensation of appropriately functionalized aryl hydrazine G-1 with cyclohexane-1,3-dione in step 1 yields the dihydrocarbazolone intermediate G-2. The keto group is then converted in step 2 using standard conditions to give oxime G-3 that can undergo a Beckmann rearrangement in step 3 to yield the tetrahydroazepinoindolone G-4. Reduction of the amide in step 4 provides hexahydroazepinoindole G-5, the secondary amino group of which can be functionalized in step 5 to provide functionalized tertiary amine G-6. The indole nitrogen atom at this stage can be functionalized in step 6 with alkyl groups (W) or protected with various protecting groups (PG) known to those skilled in the art to give G-7. At this stage, a number of options are appropriate herein for G-7. Subjecting G-7 to alkyne coupling conditions in step 7 with triisopropyl (TIPS) acetylene yields the adduct G-8, the TIPS group of which can be cleaved in step 8 under standard silane-deprotection chemistry to afford alkyne G-9. Oxidation of the triple bond of G-9 in step 9 provides aldehyde G-10, which can be treated in step 10 with, for example, an aryl lithium or aryl Grignard reagent to yield the alcohol product G-11. Halo intermediate G-7 can alternatively be treated under aryl coupling conditions such as, for example, the Heck reaction in step 11 to give product G-12, the styrene double bond of which can be hydrated in step 12 to give the tertiary alcohol product G-13. An alternative coupled product to G-8 can be obtained in step 13 through coupling of compound G-7 with appropriately functionalized aryl acetylenes to get alkyne G-14. Although the Scheme depicts phenyl or pyridyl rings in the compounds, it is understood that a number of aromatic and heteroaromatic analogs are conceivable for such synthetic routes, including but not limited to pyrimidine, pyrazine, thiophene, furan, pyrrolo, imidazole, thiazole, and the like. Similarly, the point of attachment of groups such as R′ to the aromatic or heteroaromatic groups can be envisioned in a variety of chemically feasible locations. All possible attachment locations of functional groups on the aromatic ring(s) should be considered. Representative compounds of the invention are shown in Table 1.

Example B11 Determination of Binding Activity of Compounds of the Invention at the 5-HT1B Receptor with a Radioligand Binding Competition Assay To determine the binding activity at the human recombinant serotonin 5-HT1B receptor of compounds of the invention, CHO-K1 cell line expressing the human 5-HT1B recombinant receptor is amplified to prepare membranes used for the radioligand binding assay throughout the study. Radioligand binding competition on 5-HT1B is performed by adding successively in the wells of a 96 well plate (Master Block, Greiner, 786201) 50 μL of test compounds or reference ligand (5-HT, Sigma, H-9523) at increasing concentrations (diluted in binding buffer: 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Ascorbic Acid, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), 25 μL [3H]5-CT (Amersham, TRK1038, diluted in assay buffer for a final concentration of 0.6 nM) and 25 μL 5-HT1B membrane extracts (7 μg/well). Non specific binding is determined by co-incubation with 200-fold excess of 5-HT. The plate is incubated 60 min at 25° C. in a water bath and then filtered over GF/B filters (Perkin Elmer, 6005177, presoaked in 0.5% PEI for 2 h at room temperature) with a Filtration unit (Perkin Elmer). The filters are washed 3× with 0.5 mL of ice-cold washing buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4), 50 μL, Microscint 20 (Packard) is added and the plate is incubated 15 min on an orbital shaker and then counted with a TopCount™ for 1 min/well. On each day of experimentation and prior to the testing of compounds, the reference compound is tested at several concentrations in duplicate (n=2) to obtain a dose-response curve and an estimated IC50 value. The reference value thus obtained for the test is compared to a historical value obtained from the same receptor and used to validate the experimental session. A session is considered as valid only if the reference value is found to be within a 0.5 logs interval from the historical value. For replicate determinations, the maximum variability tolerated in the test is of +/−20% around the average of the replicates. Compounds are tested for binding activity in the radioligand binding competition assay on human 5-HT1B receptor, at one concentration 5 μM, in duplicate. Dose-response data from test compounds are analyzed with XLfit (IDBS) software using nonlinear regression applied to a sigmoidal dose-response model. Example B12 Functional Activity on Recombinant Dopamine D2L and Serotonin 5-HT2A Receptors Using Aequorin, cAMP and GTPγS Functional Assays To study the functional activity of compounds of the invention on the human recombinant dopamine D2L with Aequorin, GTPγS and cAMP functional assays and on the human recombinant serotonin 5-HT2A receptor with Aequorin, CHO-K1 cell lines expressing D2L or 5-HT2A recombinant receptor, mitochondrial apoaequorin and Gα16 are used for the Aequorin assay. CHO-K1 cell line expressing the recombinant D2L receptor is used for the cAMP assay and is amplified to prepare membranes used for the GTPγS assay. Aequorin Assay Procedure: Aequorin dopamine D2L (FAST-0101A) or serotonin 5-HT2A (FAST-0505A) cells, grown 18 h prior to the test in media without antibiotics, are detached by gentle flushing with PBS-EDTA (5 mM EDTA), recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in “assay buffer” (DMEM/HAM's F12 with HEPES, without phenol red+0.1% BSA protease free). Cells are incubated at RT for at least 4 h with Coelenterazine h (Molecular Probes). Dose response curves with reference compounds are performed before testing the compounds of the invention. D2L reference agonist and antagonist are quinpirol (Tocris, 1061) and haloperidol (Tocris, 0931), respectively. 5-HT2A reference agonist and antagonist are α-methyl-5-HT (Sigma, M-110) and ketanserin (Tocris, 908), respectively. For agonist testing, 50 μL of cell suspension are injected on 50 μL of test compound or reference agonist plated in a 96-well plate. The resulting emission of light is recorded using the Hamamatsu Functional Drug Screening System 6000 (FDSS 6000). Following an incubation of 15 min after the first injection, 100 μL of reference agonist at a concentration corresponding to its EC80 is injected on the 100 μL of the mixture of cell suspension and test compound, for antagonist testing. The resulting emission of light is recorded using the same luminometer as for agonist testing. To standardize the emission of recorded light (determination of the “100% signal”) across plates and across different experiments, some of the wells contain 100 μM digitonin or a saturating concentration of ATP (20 μM). Plates also contain the reference agonist at a concentration equivalent to the EC100 and EC80 obtained during the test validation. Compounds are tested for agonist & antagonist activity at the human dopamine D2L receptor (FAST-0101A) and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (FAST-0505A) at the following nanomolar concentrations, in duplicate: Agonist (nM): 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, 3000, 10000, 30000; Antagonist (nM): 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, 1500, 5000, 15000. cAMP Assay Procedure: D2L CHO-K1 cells (FAST-0101C), grown to mid-log phase in culture media without antibiotics, are detached with PBS-EDTA (5 mM EDTA), centrifuged and resuspended in assay buffer (KRH, 1 mM IBMX) at a concentration of 2.1×105 cells/mL. The test is performed in 96 well plates. For agonist testing, 12 μL of cells (2,500 cells/well) are mixed with 6 μL of increasing concentrations of test compound or reference agonist and 6 μL of Forskolin 10 μM final concentration (Calbiochem, cat n° 344270). For antagonist testing, 12 μL of cells (2,500 cells/well) are mixed with 6 μL of test compound or reference antagonist at increasing concentrations. After incubation of 10 min at room temperature, 6 μL of a mix of Forskolin 10 μM final concentration and the reference agonist at a final concentration corresponding to the EC80 are added. The plates are then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. During the incubation, the anti-cAMP cryptate antibody (K) and the cAMP-D2 (D2) are prepared according to the manufacturer specifications (HTRF kit from Cis-Bio International (cat no 62AM2PEB). 12 μL of cAMP-D2 solution followed by 12 μL of K solution are added to each well. The plate is then covered by a top-seal and incubated for at least 1 h at room temperature. The plate is then read on the Rubystar and data are analyzed by non-linear regression using a single site model. Compounds are tested for antagonist activity at the human dopamine D2L receptor (FAST-0101C) at the following nanomolar concentrations, in duplicate: Antagonist (nM): 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, 1500, 5000, 15000. GTPγS Assay Procedure: Assay buffer [20 mM HEPES pH 7.4; 100 mM NaCl, 10 μg/mL saponin, 30 mM MgCl2]; Membranes [Recombinant CHO-K1-D2L membrane extracts thawed on ice and diluted in assay buffer to give 1 mg/mL (10 μg/10 μL) and kept on ice]; GDP [diluted in assay buffer to give 3 μM final concentration]; Beads [PVT-WGA (Amersham, RPNQ0001), diluted in assay buffer at 25 mg/mL (0.25 mg/10 μL)]; GTPγ35S [(PerkinElmer NEG030X), diluted in assay buffer to give 0.1 nM final concentration]; Ligand [Quinpirol (Tocris, 1061) as reference agonist and haloperidol (Tocris, 0931) as reference antagonist, diluted in assay buffer]. Membranes are mixed with GDP (volume:volume) and incubated for at least 15 min on ice. In parallel, GTPγ[35S] is mixed with the beads (volume:volume) just before starting the reaction. For agonist testing, the following reagents are successively added in the wells of an Optiplate (Perkin Elmer): 50 μL of test or reference ligand, 20 μL of the membranes:GDP mix, 10 μL of assay buffer and 20 μL of the GTPγ[35S]:beads mix. For antagonist testing, the following reagents are successively added in the wells of an Optiplate (Perkin Elmer): 50 μL of test or reference ligand, 20 μL of the membranes:GDP mix, and then after an incubation of 15 min at room temperature, 10 μL of reference agonist at historical EC80 concentration and 20 μL of the GTPγ[35S]:beads mix. The plates are covered with a top seal, mixed on an orbital shaker for 2 min, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Then the plates are centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm, incubated at RT 1 h and counted for 1 min/well with a Perkin Elmer TopCount reader. Compounds are tested for antagonist activity at the human dopamine D2L receptor (FAST-0101 G) at the following nanomolar concentrations, in duplicate: Antagonist (nM): 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, 1500, 5000, 15000. Example B13 Increase of Neurite Outgrowth of Neurons that are Cultured with Compounds of the Invention Neurite Outgrowth in Cortical Neurons Compounds are tested to determine their ability to stimulate neurite outgrowth of cortical neurons. Standard methods are used to isolate cortical neurons. For the isolation of primary rat cortical neurons, the fetal brain from a pregnant rat at 17 days of gestation is prepared in Leibovitz's medium (L15; Gibco). The cortex is dissected out, and the meninges are removed. Trypsin (Gibco) is used to dissociate cortical C with DNAse I. The cells are triturated for 30 min with a pipette in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (“DMEM”; Gibco) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (“FBS”) (Gibco) and centrifuged at 350×g for 10 min at RT. The cells are suspended in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 (Gibco) and 0.5 mM L-glutamine (Gibco). The cells are maintained at 30,000 cells per well of poly-L-lysine coated plates at 37° C. in 5% CO2-95% air atmosphere. After adhesion, a vehicle control or compounds of the invention are added at different concentrations to the medium. BDNF (50 ng/mL) is used as a positive control for neurite growth. After treatment, cultures are washed in phosphate-buffered saline (“PBS”; Gibco) and fixed in glutaraldehyde 2.5% in PBS. Cells are fixed after 3 days growth. Several pictures (˜80) of cells with neurites are taken per condition with a camera. The length measurements are made by analysis of the pictures using software from Image-Pro Plus (France). The results are expressed as mean (s.e.m.). Statistical analysis of the data is performed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Neurite Outgrowth in Rat Mixed Cortical Cultures Cortical mixed cultures are prepared from E18 Wistar rat embryos. The cortices are dissected out and the tissue is cut to small pieces. The cells are separated by 15-min incubation with DNase and papain. The cells are collected by centrifugation (1500 rpm, 5 min). The tissue is triturated with a pipette and the cells are plated using the micro-islet protocol (20,000 cells in 25 μL medium) on poly-L-lysine coated 48 wells, in MEM supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 0.1 μg/mL gentamicin, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS-HI) and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (HS-HI). After the cells attach to the well, 250 μL medium is added to the wells. 4 h after plating, the medium is changed to fresh medium (MEM with supplements and 5% HS-HI) containing test compound at 0.5, 5 and 50 nM concentrations. As positive controls BDNF (50, 100 and/or 150 ng/mL), and/or NGF (50 ng/mL and/or 100 ng/mL) are used. After 2 days in vitro, the cell's conditioned media are collected from plates before fixing the cells. The media samples are centrifuged 13,000 rpm 3 min to get rid of cell debris. The samples are stored at −20° C. for later analysis. Cells are formaldehyde-fixed and processed for immunocytochemistry. BDNF levels in the conditioned media are determined with a BDNF ELISA using the manufacturers (Promega, BDNF Emax® ImmunoAssay System, catalog number: G7610) instructions. The cultures are fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 0.01 M PBS for 30 min and washed once with PBS. The fixed cells are first permeabilized and non-specific binding is blocked by a 30-min incubation with blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Rabbit anti-MAP-2 (dilution 1:1000, AB5622, Chemicon, in blocking buffer) is used as a primary antibody. The cells are incubated with the primary antibody for 48 h at +4° C., washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor568 (1:200, A11036, Molecular Probes) for 2 h at RT. The immunopositive cells are visualized by a fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filter set, and documented by a high resolution image capturing. The number of cells per field (4 field per well) are counted, and the neurite outgrowth is quantified using Image Pro Plus software. The number of wells per compound concentration used is 6 (n=6). All data are presented as mean±standard deviation (SD) or standard error of mean (SEM), and differences are considered to be statistically significant at the p<0.05 level. Statistical analysis is performed using StatsDirect statistical software. Differences between group means are analyzed by using 1-way-ANOVA followed by Dunnet's test (comparison to the vehicle treated group). Example B14 Use of an In Vivo Model to Evaluate the Ability of Compounds to Enhance Cognition, Learning and Memory in Scopolamine Treated Rats The two-trial object recognition paradigm developed by Ennaceur and Delacour in the rat is used as a model of episodic short term memory. Ennaceur, A., and Delacour, J. (1988), Behav. Brain Res. 31:47-59. The paradigm is based on spontaneous exploratory activity of rodents and does not involve rule learning or reinforcement. The novel object recognition paradigm is sensitive to the effects of ageing and cholinergic dysfunction. See, e.g., Scali, C. et al, Neurosci. Letts. 170:117-120, 1994; and Bartolini, L. et al, Biochem. Behav. 53:277-283, 1996. Male Sprague-Dawley rats between six and seven weeks old, weighing between 220-300 grams are obtained from Centre d′Elevage (Rue Janvier, B. P. 55, Le Genest-Saint-Isle 53940, France). The animals are housed in groups of 2 to 4 in polypropylene cages (with a floor area of 1032 cm2) under standard conditions: at RT (22±2° C.), under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, with food and water provided ad libitum. Animals are permitted to acclimate to environmental conditions for at least 5 days before the experiment begins, and are numbered on their tails with indelible marker. The experimental arena is a square wooden box (60 cm×60 cm×40 cm) painted dark blue, with 15 cm×15 cm black squares under a clear plexiglass floor. The arena and objects placed inside the arena are cleaned with water between each trial to eliminate any odor trails left by rats. The arena is placed in a dark room illuminated only by halogen lamps directed towards the ceiling in order to produce a uniformly dim light in the box of approximately 60 lux. The day before testing, animals are allowed to freely explore the experimental arena for 3 min in the presence of two objects (habituation). Animals to be tested are placed in the experimental room at least 30 min before testing. Novel object recognition test is comprised of two trials separated by an interval of 120 min or 24 h. When agents that disrupt memory such as the cholinergic antagonist scopolamine are used an inter-trial interval of 120 min is preferred. Alternatively a 24 h inter-trial interval is used when studying effect of natural forgetting on novel object recognition task. During the first, or acquisition, trial (T1), rats are placed in the arena, where two identical objects have been previously placed. The time required for each animal to complete 15 sec. of object exploration is determined, with a cut-off time of 4 min. Exploration is considered to be directing the nose at a distance less than 2 centimeters (“cm”) from the object and/or touching the object. During the second, or testing, trial (T2), one of the objects presented in the first trial is replaced with an unknown or novel object, while the second, familiar object is left in place. Rats are placed back in the arena for 3 min., and exploration of both objects is determined. Locomotor activity of rats (number of times rats cross grid lines visible under the clear plexiglass floor) is scored for during T1 and T2. At the conclusion of the experiments, the rats are sacrificed by an overdose of pentobarbital given intraperitoneally. The following parameters are measured as part of the novel object recognition task: (1) time required to achieve 15 sec. of object exploration during T1; (2) locomotor activity during T1 (number of crossed lines); (3) time spent in active exploration of the familiar object during T2 (TFamiliar); (4) time spent in active exploration of the novel object during T2 (TNovel); and (5) locomotor activity during T2 (number of crossed lines). The difference between time spent in active exploration of the novel object during T2 and time spent in active exploration of the familiar object during T2 (ΔTNovel−TFamiliar) is evaluated. The % of animals in each group with TNovel−TFamiliar greater than or equal to 5 sec. is also derived; described as % of good learners. Animals not meeting a minimal level of object exploration are excluded from the study as having naturally low levels of spontaneous exploration. Thus, only rats exploring the objects for at least five sec. (TNovel−TFamiliar>5 sec.) are included in the study. Animals are randomly assigned to groups of 14. Compounds of the invention and controls are administered to animals the groups as follows: Solutions of compounds are prepared freshly each day at a concentration of 0.25 mg/mL using purified water or saline as vehicle. Donepezil, used as a positive control, and scopolamine are administered simultaneously in a single solution of saline (5 mL/kg) prepared freshly each day. Scopolamine is purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (Catalog No. S-1875; St. Quentin Fallavier, France) is dissolved in saline to a concentration of 0.06 mg/mL. Donepezil is administered (e.g., intraperitoneally) 40 minutes before the acquisition trial (T1). Scopolamine is administered (e.g., intraperitoneally) 30 minutes before the acquisition trial (T1). Vehicle (purified water) or test compound is administered (e.g., by gavage) 25 minutes before the acquisition trial (T1), 5 min after scopolamine challenge. The volume of administration is 5 mL/kg body weight for compounds administered intraperitoneally, and 10 mL/kg for compounds administered orally. Recognition scores and % of good learners for compounds of the invention are determined. Example B15 Use of an In Vivo Model to Determine the Ability of Compounds to Treat, Prevent and/or Delay the Onset and/or the Development of Schizophrenia (Hyperactivity in PCP Treated Animals) In vivo models of schizophrenia can be used to determine the ability of the compounds described herein to treat and/or prevent and/or delay the onset and/or the development of schizophrenia. One exemplary model for testing the activity of one or more compounds described herein to treat and/or prevent and/or delay the onset and/or development of schizophrenia employs phencyclidine (PCP), which is administered to the animal (e.g., non-primate (rat) or primate (monkey)), resulting in dysfunctions similar to those seen in schizophrenic humans. See Jentsch et al, Science 277:953-955, 1997; and Piercey et al, Life Sci. 43(4):375-385, 1988. Standard experimental protocols may be employed in this or in other animal models. One protocol involves PCP-induced hyperactivity. Male C57Bl/6J mice from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Me.) are used. Mice are received at 6-weeks of age. Upon receipt, mice are assigned unique identification numbers (tail marked) and are group housed with 4 mice/cage in OPTIMICE ventilated cages. All animals remain housed in groups of 4 during the remainder of the study. All mice are acclimated to the colony room for at least 2 weeks prior to testing and are subsequently tested at an average age of 8 weeks of age. During the period of acclimation, mice are examined on a regular basis, handled, and weighed to assure adequate health and suitability. Animals are maintained on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. The RT is maintained between 20 and 23° C. with a relative humidity maintained between 30% and 70%. Food and water are provided ad libitum for the duration of the study. In each test, animals are randomly assigned across treatment groups. The following compounds are used for this study: 1) Compound of the invention (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 & 30 mg/kg) is dissolved in 5% PEG-200 in sterile water and administered p.o. 30 min prior to PCP injection; 2) Clozapine (1.0 mg/kg) is dissolved in 10% DMSO and administered i.p. 30 min prior to phencyclidine (PCP) injection; 3) PCP (5.0 mg/kg) is dissolved in sterile water and administered i.p. immediately before the 60 min test. All compounds are administered at a dose volume of 10 mL/kg. The open filed (OF) test assesses locomotor behavior, to measure mouse locomotor activity at baseline and in response to pharmacological agents. The open field chambers are Plexiglas square chambers (27.3×27.3×20.3 cm; Med Associates Inc., St Albans, Vt.) surrounded by infrared photobeams (16×16×16) to measure horizontal and vertical activity. The analysis is configured to divide the open field into a center and periphery zone such that the infrared photobeams allow measurement of activity in the center and periphery of the field. Distance traveled is measured from horizontal beam breaks as the mouse moves whereas rearing activity is measured from vertical beam breaks. Mice (10 to 12 animals per treatment group) are brought to the activity experimental room for at least 1 h acclimation to the experimental room conditions prior to testing. Eight animals are tested in each run. Mice are administered vehicle (e.g., 10% DMSO or 5% PEG200 and 1% Tween 80), Compound of the invention, clozapine (positive control, 1 mg/kg ip) and placed in the OF chambers for 30 min following which they are injected with either water or PCP and placed back in the OF chambers for a 60-min session. At the end of each OF test session the OF chambers are thoroughly cleaned. Data are analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc comparisons with Fisher Tests when appropriate. Baseline activity is measured during the first 30 min of the test prior to PCP injection. PCP-induced activity is measured during the 60 min following PCP injection. Statistical outliers that fall above or below 2 standard deviations from the mean are removed from the final analyses. An effect is considered significant if p<0.05. Example B16 Use of an In Vivo Model to Determine the Ability of Compounds to Treat, Prevent and/or Delay the Onset and/or the Development of Schizophrenia (Hyperactivity in Amphetamine Treated Animals) Male mice (various strains e.g., C57Bl/6J) from appropriate supplier (for example Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Me.) are used. Mice typically are received at 6-weeks of age. Mice are acclimated to the colony room for at least two weeks prior to testing. During the period of acclimation, mice are examined on a regular basis, handled, and weighed to assure adequate health and suitability and maintained on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. The RT is maintained between 20 and 23° C. with a relative humidity maintained between 30% and 70%. Food and water are provided ad libitum for the duration of the study. In each test, animals are randomly assigned between treatment groups. The open field test (OF) is used to assess motor activity. The open field chambers are plexiglas square chambers (e.g., 27.3×27.3×20.3 cm; Med Associates Inc., St Albans, Vt.) surrounded by infrared photobeam sources (16×16×16). The enclosure is configured to split the open field into a center and periphery zone and the photocell beams are set to measure activity in the center and in the periphery of the OF chambers. Horizontal activity (distance traveled) and vertical activity (rearing) are measured from consecutive beam breaks. On the day of testing, animals are brought to the experimental room for at least 1 h acclimation prior to start of treatment. Animals are administered with vehicle, haloperidol (positive control, 0.1 mg/kg ip) or compound of the invention and placed in the OF. The time of administration of test compound to each animal is recorded. Baseline activity is recorded for 30 min following which mice receive amphetamine (4 mg/kg) or water and are placed back in the OF chambers for a 60-min session. At the end of each open field test session the OF chambers are thoroughly cleaned. Typically ten to twelve mice are tested in each group. Test compound doses typically range from 0.01 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg. Data are analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc comparisons with Fisher Tests when appropriate. Baseline activity is measured during the first 30 min of the test prior to amphetamine injection. Amphetamine-induced activity is measured during the 60 min following amphetamine injection. Statistical outliers that fall above or below 2 standard deviations from the mean are removed from the final analyses. An effect is considered significant if p<0.05. Total distance traveled and total rearing following amphetamine administration are compared between groups treated with compound and groups treated with vehicle and positive control haloperidol. Example B17 Use of the In Vivo Conditioned Avoidance Response (CAR) Model to Determine the Ability of Compounds to Treat, Prevent and/or Delay the Onset and/or the Development of Schizophrenia All currently approved antipsychotic agents (typical and atypical) are known to have the ability to selectively suppress conditioned avoidance response (CAR) behavior in the rat. This evidence makes CAR one of the primary tests to assess antipsychotic activity of novel compounds. The effects of compounds of the invention, at concentrations including 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg, p.o., in the conditioned avoidance response model are assessed in the male Wistar rat. Risperidone (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) is used in the present study as a positive reference compound. For each testing session, animals are first placed for a 4-min habituation period in a shuttlebox with an electrified grid floor. Then, rats are submitted to 30 trials spaced by intertrial intervals varying at random between 20 and 30 sec. Each trial consists of a 10-sec. light stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS) followed by a 10-sec. electric foot shock (unconditioned stimulus, US) in presence of the light presented in the compartment where the rat is located. If the animal moves to the other compartment during the initial 10-sec. of the trial, the light is terminated (no shock is delivered) and the response is recorded as an avoidance response. If the rat changes compartment during the foot shock, the light and the shock are terminated and the response is recorded as an unconditioned response. If the rat does not change compartment during the 10-sec. light period (CS) and during the 10-sec. shock+light period (US+CS), an escape failure is recorded. If a response is made during an intertrial interval, the response is recorded as an intertrial crossing. Training is performed 5 days per week with one session of 30 trials per day, until rats reach the performance criterion of 80% of avoidance response on at least two consecutive daily sessions. Once the performance criterion is reached, each animal is sequentially administered with vehicle (15% HPBCD, p.o.), Compound of the invention (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg, p.o.) and risperidone (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.). A minimal wash-out period of 48 h is allowed between 2 treatments. During the wash-out period, animals are trained until they recover an avoidance performance of at least 80%. Statistical analysis is performed using a Friedman two-way ANOVA by ranks followed by the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test to test each dose of the test compound administered versus vehicle control treated rats. Example B18 An Animal Model of the Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia: Subchronic PCP-Induced Social Interaction Deficits Phencyclidine (PCP) administered to humans as well to experimental animals induces full-spectrum of schizophrenia symptoms, including negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. A major symptom of schizophrenia is considered to be social isolation/withdrawal as part of the cluster of negative symptoms. Subchronic treatment with PCP in rats leads to the development of clear signs of social withdrawal as measured by deficits in the interaction time with a cage intruder rat. Male Sprague Dawley rats (˜150 g on arrival) from Harlan (Indiana) are used in this study. Upon receipt, rats are group housed in OPTI rats ventilated cages. Rats are housed in groups of 2-3/cage for the remainder of the study. During the period of acclimation, rats are examined on a regular basis, handled, and weighed to assure adequate health and suitability. Rats are maintained on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle with the light on at 7:00 a.m. The RT is maintained between 20 and 23° C. with a relative humidity maintained between 30% and 70%. Chow and water are provided ad libitum for the duration of the study. Animals are randomly assigned across treatment groups and balanced by age. Animals are not disturbed between test days. The following compounds are used. 1) Compound of the invention (0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg; p.o.) is dissolved in 3% Tween and PBS and administered 30 min prior to test; 2) PCP (2 mg/kg; s.c.) is dissolved in saline and administered twice daily for 5 days prior to test day; 3) Clozapine (2.5 mg/kg; i.p.) is dissolved in 5% PEG:5% Tween 80 in saline and administered 30 min prior to test. All compounds are administered at a dose volume of 1 mL/kg. For 5 days prior to test, rats are injected twice daily with either PCP (2 mg/kg; s.c) or saline (s.c). On day 6 and following a 30 min pretreatment with vehicle, clozapine or Compound of the invention, a pair of rats, unfamiliar to each other, receiving the same treatment are placed in a white plexiglas open field arena (24″×17″×8″) and allowed to interact with each other for 6 min. Social interactions (‘SI’) include: sniffing the other rat; grooming the other rat; climbing over or under or around the other rat; following the other rat; or exploring the ano-genital area of the other rat. Passive contact and aggressive contact are not considered a measure of social interaction. The time the rats spend interacting with each other during the 6 min test is recorded by a trained observer. The social interaction chambers are thoroughly cleaned between the different rats. Data are analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc analysis (e.g., Fischer, Dunnett) when appropriate. An effect is considered significant if p<0.05. Example B19 An Animal Model of Extrapyramidal Syndrome (EPS): Measurement of Catalepsy in the Mouse Bar Test Antipsychotic drugs are known to induce extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) in animals and in humans. An animal model considered to be predictive of EPS is the mouse bar test, which measures cataleptic responses to pharmacological agents. Male C57B1I6J mice from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Me.) are used. Mice are received at 6-weeks of age. Upon receipt, mice are assigned unique identification numbers (tail marked) and are group housed with 4 mice/cage in OptiMICE ventilated cages. All animals remain housed in groups of four during the remainder of the study. All mice are acclimated to the colony room for at least two weeks prior to testing and are subsequently tested at an average age of 8 weeks. During the period of acclimation, mice are examined on a regular basis, handled, and weighed to assure adequate health and suitability. Animals are maintained on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. The RT is maintained between 20 and 23° C. with a relative humidity maintained between 30% and 70%. Chow and water are provided ad libitum for the duration of the study. In each test, animals are randomly assigned across treatment groups. The following compounds are used for this study. 1) Compound of the invention (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 mg/kg) is dissolved in 3% Tween in PBS and administered orally at a dose volume of 10 mL/kg; 2) Haloperidol (2 mg/kg) is dissolved in 10% DMSO and administered i.p. at a dose volume of 10 mL/kg. The front paws of a mouse are placed on a horizontal metal bar raised 2″ above a Plexiglas platform and time is recorded for up to 30 sec. per trial. The test ends when the animal's front paws return to the platform or after 30 sec. The test is repeated three times and the average of the three trials is reported as the intensity index of catalepsy. Antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol cause rigidity as a side effect. Animals treated with haloperidol will hold on to the bar without moving for several minutes. Mice are brought to the activity experimental room for at least 1 h acclimation to the experimental room conditions prior to testing. Following injection of either vehicle, Compound of the invention, or haloperidol, catalepsy is assessed at 3 time points: 30 min, 1 h and 3 h. At the end of each trial, the apparatus is thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol. Data are analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc comparisons with Fisher Tests when appropriate. An effect is considered significant if p<0.05. Example B20 Use of the 5-Choice Serial Reaction Task to Determine the Ability of Compounds to Enhance Attention/Vigilance and Reduce Impulsivity Attention and impulsivity are characteristic of several disease states. The continuous performance test (CPT), used in humans, is capable of detecting attention deficits in a number of disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia and mild cognitive impairment. The pre-clinical analogue of the CPT is the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT). In this operant-based test, rats are required to be attentive and withhold responding while they monitor 5 apertures for the appearance of a brief stimulus light in one of the apertures. The brief illumination of the stimulus light in the 5CSRTT is analogous to the appearance of the “correct” letters in the CPT in humans. Upon observing the stimulus light, the rat must nose-poke in the corresponding aperture to receive a food reward. The 5CSRTT allows the measurement of similar behavioral responses as the CPT, including accuracy, speed of responding, impulsive and compulsive responding. In this study, drug tests are performed under altered test parameters which result in increased premature responding. This premature responding is hypothesized to indicate impulsivity, e.g., a failure to withhold an inappropriate response, and has been shown to be sensitive to atomoxetine. Thirteen male Long-Evans rats (275-300 g) are obtained from Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, Ind. At the time of testing for the current study, the rats are approximately 16-18 months old. Upon arrival, the rats are assigned unique identification numbers (tail marked). Rats are single-housed in OptiRAT cages and acclimated for 7 days prior to commencing a food-restriction regimen: rats are held at 85% of age-matched free-feeding control bodyweights, receiving approximately 10-20 g of rat chow daily. Water is provided ad libitum, except during testing. Animals are maintained in a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 0700 EST) with RT maintained at 22±2° C. and the relative humidity maintained at approximately 50%. All animals are examined, handled and weighed prior to initiation of the study to assure adequate health and suitability and to minimize non-specific stress associated with testing. The 5CSRTT sessions are performed during the animal's light cycle phase. All experiments and procedures are approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of PsychoGenics, Inc. The apparatus consists of 10 aluminum and Plexiglas chambers with grid floors (width 31.5 cm, depth 25.0 cm, height 33.0 cm), housed in sound-attenuating cabinets. Each cabinet is fitted with a low-level noise extractor fan which also helped to mask external noise. The left wall of each chamber is concavely curved with 5 apertures evenly spaced, located approximately 2.5 cm from the floor. Each aperture contains a standard 3 W LED to serve as stimulus lights. The opposite wall contains a food magazine, located approximately 3.0 cm from the floor. Each chamber is illuminated with a 3 W house-light located in the center of the ceiling panel. After each test session the apparatus is cleaned with 70% ethanol. The following compounds are used for this study. 1) Compound of the invention is dissolved in saline, and administered p.o. at 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg, 30 min prior to testing at 1 mL/kg body weight; 2) The reference compound atomoxetine (1.0 mg/kg) is dissolved in saline and administered i.p. 30 min prior to testing at 1 mL/kg body weight. Training: Animals are trained to monitor the five apertures for stimulus light illumination. Each session is initiated by the illumination of the house light, and the delivery of a food reward into the magazine. The first trial begins when the rat opens the magazine to obtain the food pellet. After the inter-trial interval (ITI) one of the stimulus lights is illuminated for 500 msec. The rat must nose-poke in the illuminated aperture either during or within 5 sec. of stimulus light illumination. Such a response is defined as a correct response, and is rewarded with delivery of a food pellet. Collection of the pellet initiates the next trial. A nose-poke response in a non-illuminated aperture (incorrect response) or a nose-poke after the 5 sec. limited hold (missed trial) results in termination of the trial with extinction of the house-light and imposition of a time-out period. Testing: After acquisition of the 5CSRTT with a high level of accuracy (at least 75% correct, at least 50 trials completed per session), drug testing begins. Animals are treated with test compound (various doses, appropriate vehicle), vehicle and positive control (atomoxetine 1 mg/kg ip). During drug test sessions, the ITI is varied between 10, 7, 5 or 4 sec. in duration, presented in groups of 4 trials (each of which contains 1 trial at each ITI duration in a randomized order). The session ends when 60 min have elapsed. All rats receive all drug treatments, according to a randomized-order within-subjects design. Drug tests are performed on Wednesdays and Fridays of each week, only when rats perform at least 75% correct trials for a minimum of 50 trials in the previous test session. Measures obtained during the test sessions are: (1) percent correct, defined as the number of correct trials ×100, divided by the total number of correct and incorrect trials, (2) missed trials, defined as responding beyond the 5 sec. limited hold or failing to respond, (3) correct latency, defined as the time taken to make a correct response after the illumination of the stimulus, (4) magazine latency, defined as the time taken to enter the magazine to collect the food pellet after making a correct response, (5) premature responding, defined as the total number of nose-poke responses made during the ITI, and (6) perseverative responding, defined as the total number of additional responses emitted after the initial nose-poke. Example B21 An Animal Model to Test the Anxiolytic Effects of Compounds Using the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) Test This study aims to test the anxiolytic properties of compounds of the invention using the elevated plus maze (EPM) test in C57Bl/6J mice. Male C57Bl/6J mice from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Me.) are used for the open field study. Mice are received at 6-weeks of age. Upon receipt, mice are assigned unique identification numbers (tail marked) and are group housed with 4 mice/cage in OPTI mouse ventilated cages. All animals remain housed in groups of four during the remainder of the study. All mice are acclimated to the colony room for approximately 2 week prior to testing and are subsequently tested at an average age of 8 weeks of age. During the period of acclimation, mice and rats are examined on a regular basis, handled, and weighed to assure adequate health and suitability. Animals are maintained on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. The RT is maintained between 20 and 23° C. with a relative humidity maintained between 30% and 70%. Chow and water are provided ad libitum for the duration of the study. In each test, animals are randomly assigned across treatment groups. All animals are euthanized after the completion of the study. The following compounds are used for this study: 1) Compound of the invention (0.03, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg) is dissolved in 5% PEG200/H2O and administered orally at a dose volume of 10 mL/kg 30 min prior to test; 2) Diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) is dissolved in 45% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and administered orally at a dose volume of 10 mL/kg 30 min prior to test. The elevated plus maze test assesses anxiety. The maze (Hamilton Kinder) consists of two closed arms (14.5 h×5 w×35 1 cm) and two open arms (6 w×35 1 cm) forming a cross, with a square center platform (6×6 cm). All visible surfaces are made of black acrylic. Each arm of the maze is placed on a support column 56 cm above the floor. Antistatic black vinyl curtains (7′ tall) surround the EPM to make a 5′×5″ enclosure. Animals are brought to acclimate to the experimental room at least 1 h before the test. Mice are placed in the center of the elevated plus maze facing the closed arm for a 5-min run. All animals are tested once. The time spent, distance traveled and entries in each arm are automatically recorded by the computer. The EPM is thoroughly cleaned after each mouse. Data are analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher's LSD post hoc analysis when appropriate. An effect is considered significant if p<0.05. Example B22 Cell Culture and Cell Viability Assay SH-SY5Y cells cultured in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% FBS were seeded in 96-well microplates at 150,000 cells/cm2. After 24 h, cells were depleted from FBS and kept in culture for 24 h before the experiment. A stock solution was prepared by dissolving the calcium ionophore 4-Br-A23187 (Calbiochem Cat. No 100107) in DMSO at 25 mM. Cells were then treated with 4-Br-A23187 (2 μM), hydrogen peroxide (300 μM) or the mitochondrial toxin rotenone (25 μM) in the presence of vehicle or Compound of the Invention for 24 h. Cell death was determined by measurements of LDH release according to the Cytotoxicity Detection KitPlus (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Cell viability was determined by measuring the capacity of cells to metabolize MTS tetrazolium (MTS) according to the Cytotoxicity Detection KitPlus (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and MTS reduction is assessed by the CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation assay (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA). Compounds were screened at 10 nM, using DMSO as vehicle. Assay results for the experiments with Br-A23187 are presented as the MTS reduction capacity (cell viability) of untreated cells (control), 4-Br-A23187-treated cells (vehicle), and co-incubation of Br-A23187 with Compounds of the Invention treated cells and using p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) at 10 μM for 30 min as a control. This assay assesses the ability of the test compounds to protect against cell death that is mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction. In the assay, the calcium ionophore 4-Br-A23187 is used to challenge the cells, causing calcium levels to rise in mitochondria, which leads to depolarization and cell death. Test compounds are assessed for their ability to prevent cell death in response to challenge with 4-Br-A23187.

Stefanis, Division of Basic Neurosciences, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece) are cultured as described by Vekrellis et al. (Vekrellis K, Xilouri M, Emmanouilidou E, Stefanis L. (2009). Inducible over-expression of α-syn in human neuronal cells leads to caspase-dependent non-apoptotic death. J Neurochem 109, 1348-1362). In accordance with this method, cells are cultured and maintained in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 250 μg/mL G418 and 50 μg/mL Hygromycin B. Expression of α-syn is switched off in stock cultures with doxycycline (2 μg/mL). For experimental procedures, cells are plated at (4-8×104 cells/cm2) and differentiated in absence of doxycycline and in the presence of 20 μM all-trans retinoic acid (RA) (Sigma, St Louis, Mo., USA). Viability Assay Cells are cultured in 96-well plates. After 24 h, cells are treated with RA and Compounds of Invention at 0.1 and 10 nM in the absence of doxycyline. Culture medium with RA and drugs is fully replaced after 7 days. Cell viability is measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from necrotic cells into the culture medium and by measuring the capacity of cells to metabolize MTS tetrazolium (MTS) after 14 days in culture. LDH leakage is assessed according to the Cytotoxicity Detection KitPlus (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and MTS reduction is assessed by the CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation assay (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA). Immunoblotting of α-synuclein and α-synuclein aggregates Cells stably expressing α-_synuclein are cultured in 6-well plates at a density of 4×104 cells/cm2 cells per well. Cells are differentiated and treated with Compound of the Invention at 10 nM in absence of dox after 24 h of plating. Drug treatments are repeated after 7 days in freshly prepared medium containing RA. After 14 days, cells are washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in lysys buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM PMSF pH 7.4, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Lysates are homogenized and subjected to four successive freeze-thaw cycles to disrupt membranes. Triton soluble fractions and triton insoluble pellets are obtained by ultracentrifugation at 100,000×g for 30 min at 4° C. The concentration of protein in each fraction is determined by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). Samples from total, soluble and triton insoluble fractions, are boiled in 1× sample buffer (20 mM Tris, 1% glycerol, 180 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.003% bromophenol blue, and 2% SDS, pH 6.8), loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (0.2 μM-pore immobilon Biorad). Membranes are blocked in 1×TBS-Tween (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) containing 5% milk for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4° C. with the following primary antibodies in blocking solution at the indicated dilutions: monoclonal anti-α-synuclein α-syn-1 (1:1000; BD Transduction Laboratories). (Perrin, R. J., Payton, J. E., Barnett, D. H., Wraight, C. L., Woods, W. S., Ye, L., and George, J. M. (2003). Epitope mapping and specificity of the anti-α-_synuclein monoclonal antibody Syn-1 in mouse brain and cultured cell lines. Neurosci Lett 349, 133-135), and monoclonal vimentin (1:1000; BD PharMingen). Primary antibodies are detected with secondary anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to HRP (1:5000). Isolation of RNA and RT-Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) SH-SY5Y cells stably over-expressing α-syn are treated with Compound of the Invention (10 nM). Total RNA from these cells as well as control cells not treated with Compound is extracted using the E.Z.N.A RNA extraction Kit (OMEGAbiotek, Norcross, Ga.). 1 μg of RNA is reverse transcribed to cDNA using the M-Mulv reverse transcriptase enzyme (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA). RT-qPCR of cDNA templates is carried out using TAQMAN probes for human α-synuclein (Hs00240906_Ml) and TAQMAN masterMix (Applied Biosystems) and a Mx3005P real-time PCR system (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.). Levels of alpha-tubulin mRNA are used to normalize the amounts of total RNA between samples. Fold changes are calculated as described by (Pfaffl, M. W. (2001).
