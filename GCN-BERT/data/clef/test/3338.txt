CLAIM OF PRIORITY This application claims the benefit of priority of India Patent Application No. 3759/DEL/2013, filed on Dec. 24, 2013, the benefit of priority of which is claimed hereby, and which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. FIELD OF INVENTION The present disclosure relates to a method of producing transgenic plants over-expressing OsAlba1 gene. The transgenic plants have enhanced stress tolerance. The disclosure also provides cDNA, recombinant DNA constructs, recombinant DNA vectors, and recombinant host cells comprising the OsAlba1 cDNA. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Availability of water is the most crucial factor that limits the productivity potential of higher plants and is a serious threat to sustainable crop production. In order to improve the agricultural productivity under water-deficit condition or dehydration, it is required to first understand the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which plants tolerate such stress. Extensive investigations at the molecular level of plant response to environmental stresses have led to the cloning of various stress inducible genes (Ingram et al., Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol., 1996, 47, 377-403; Bray, Trends Plant Sci., 1997, 2, 48-54). Nevertheless, the significance of these genes in stress tolerance is incomplete without the knowledge of their function. Most studies on stress adaptation have mainly focused on the changes in gene expression, while far less information is available on their protein counterparts. Rice is the most important food cereal, with nearly half of the world's population relying on its successful harvests. While rice is the first crop plant to have its complete genome sequenced (Goff et al., Science, 2002, 296, 92-100; Yu et al., Science, 2002, 296, 79-92), the functions of most of the predicted genes are unknown. Therefore, characterization of these unknown genes is one of the major challenges of the rice functional genomics. The nucleus is a highly organized organelle that contains specific functional domains essential for the regulated expression of proteins in eukaryotes. The fact that nearly one-fourth of total cellular proteins are localized in the nucleus implies a variety of function in this compartment (Kumar et al., Genes Dev. 2002, 16, 707-719). Though it is an attractive target for the study of cellular homeostasis and determination of genomic response to stress, the plant nuclear proteomics is still in its infancy, particularly with respect to stress tolerance. Of the few plant nuclear matrix proteins characterized, no obvious homology was found with known nuclear proteins in yeast and mammals (Gindullis et al., Plant Cell, 1999, 11, 1117-1128; Gindullis et al., Plant Cell, 1999, 11, 1755-1768). Interestingly, Alba (acetylation lowers binding affinity) proteins, first identified as DNA-binding proteins in archaea, and then in association with nuclear RNase P/MRP in yeast and mammalian cells, are part of a superfamily that spans through three domains of life (Mani et al., 2011). The members of Alba family proteins have been reported to play important role in transcriptional regulation by maintaining chromatin architecture (Aravind et al., Genome Biol. 4, 2003, R64). The dimeric protein, formerly named Sso10b, is conserved in most sequenced archaeal genomes (Forterre et al., Mol. Microbiol., 1999, 32, 669-670) and binds double-stranded DNA tightly, but without apparent sequence specificity (Grote et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1986, 873, 405-413; Xue et al., J. Bacteriol., 2000, 182, 3929-3933; Bell et al., Science, 2002, 296, 148-151). As evident from its name, Alba is controlled by acetylation and deacetylation, where acetylation at specific N-terminal lysine residue lowers its binding affinity toward double-stranded DNA (Bell et al., Science, 2002, 296, 148-151; Zhao et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2003, 278, 26071-26077). In Sulfolobus solfataricus, Alba was found to be reversibly acetylated at Lys-16 by a homolog of Pat (protein acetyltransferase) and deacetylated by Sir2 protein, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase belonging to sirtuin family (Bell et al., Science, 2002, 296, 148-151; Starai et al., J. Mol. Biol., 2004, 340, 1005-1012; Marsh et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2005, 280, 21122-21128). The best-studied eukaryotic members of the family are the human and yeast proteins Rpp20/Pop7 and Rpp25/Pop6 (Perederina et al., RNA, 2010, 13, 1648-1655 2007; Hands-Taylor et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 2010, 38, 4052-4066). A recent study suggested that they are only transiently associated with RNase MRP in vivo and are not present in the catalytically active complex (Welting et al., RNA, 2006, 12, 1373-1382). By and large, however, their function remains far from understood. PCT/IB2002/005253 discloses over-expression of MnSOD in crop plants for improved resistance against environmental stress conditions. PCT/CN2012/074106 discloses over-expression of rice OXHS4 gene for improved resistance against drought tolerance.

EXAMPLES The disclosure will now be illustrated with working examples, which is intended to illustrate the working of disclosure and not intended to take restrictively to imply any limitations on the scope of the present disclosure. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice of the disclosed methods and compositions, the exemplary methods, devices and materials are described herein. Example 1 Molecular Cloning of OsAlba1 The full-length cDNA of OsAlba1 was amplified from O. sativa ssp. indica (cv. Rasi) using the primers as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3 (forward) and SEQ ID NO: 4 (reverse). The PCR mixture contained 1× reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT, 60 mM KCl and 2.5% glycerol), 2.5 mM dNTPs, 2.5 U Taq DNA Polymerase, 2 mM MgCl2, 20 pmol each of the forward and reverse primers. The reaction was conducted in a thermal cycler at the following settings: denaturation at 95° C. for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94° C. for 30 s, annealing at 65° C. for 30 s, and an extension at 72° C. for 1 min. The final extension was performed at 72° C. for 10 min. The PCR product was cloned into the pGEMT vector and confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing. Example 2 Bacterial Over-Expression of GST-OsAlba1 Fusion Protein The OsAlba1 cDNA was inserted in-frame in to the expression plasmid pGEX4T-2 (GE Healthcare) using BamHI and NotI restriction sites engineered at 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The insert sequence and reading frame were verified by nucleotide sequencing, and the construct was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Over-expression of recombinant protein was induced by the addition of IPTG at a final concentration of 0.3 mM. The cultures were incubated for 2 to 5 hours at 37° C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the recombinant protein was resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and the band harboring OsAlba1 was excised from the gel, and in-gel digested with trypsin. The peptide mix generated was eluted and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis (QSTAR Elite, AB Sciex). Multiple peptides with a high statistical probability (p<0.05) of matches to the relevant protein were analysed to confirm the identity Example 3 Transcript Analysis Total RNA was extracted from unstressed and stressed rice seedlings using TRIpure reagent (Invitrogen), and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega). An aliquot of 15 μg RNA was electrophoretically separated on 1.5% agarose gels and transferred onto nylon membranes (GE Healthcare) and UV cross-linked. Hybridization was performed with Alba cDNA fragment (0.459 kb) labelled with [32P] dCTP using a NEBlot Phototype kit (New England Biolabs Inc.) under high-stringency conditions. The blot was pre-hybridized in 10 ml of hybridization buffer for at least 2 h at 60° C. with gentle rotation followed by addition of the radiolabelled probe. Following overnight hybridization, the blots were washed and exposed to pre-flashed autoradiography film, kept at −80° C. for 2 days, and developed. FIG. 1 shows the relative distribution of OsAlba1 gene transcript in various parts of plant. It can be inferred that maximal transcript expression of OsAlba1 can be seen in flag leaf, while there is a minimal detectable expression in other plant parts such as root, stem, leaf, and sheath. No detectable expression could be seen in panicle. Example 4 Immnoblot Analysis Immunoblot analysis was carried out by resolving nuclear proteins on a uniform 16% SDS-PAGE, and electro-transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) at 150 mA for 3 hours. The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk for 2 hours and incubated with anti-OsAlba1 polyclonal antibody, at a dilution of 1/5000 in TBS buffer for 1 hour. The antibody was raised in rabbit against an antigenic peptide having amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 5. The blot was eventually incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit-IgG (Sigma) at a dilution of 1/10,000 in TBS buffer for 1 hour and the signals were detected using NBT/BCIP (nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate) method. FIG. 2 shows the OsAlba11 protein distribution in various plant tissues. It can be inferred from FIG. 2 that maximal protein can be seen in flag leaf, and leaf. Background minimal expression can be detected in root, and stem of plant tissue. Example 5 Sub-Cellular Localization of OsAlba1 Inner epidermal peels of young onion bulb were placed on MS-agar plates supplemented with 3% sucrose. Approximately 25 μg of OsAlba1 construct plasmid was coated onto 1.6 μm gold particle (Bio-Rad) with 2.5 M CaCl2 and 0.1 M spermidine, and mixed vigorously. Plasmid-coated particles were dehydrated with 75% and 95% ethanol prior to bombardment and introduced transiently into epidermal cells by microprojectile bombardment using a PDS-1000/He-driven particle accelerator (Bio-Rad). The samples were incubated for 22-24 h under dark conditions at 22° C. before analysis with TCS SP2 confocal system (Leica, Germany) for fluorescence detection. GFP signals were detected between 505-550 nm after exciting with 488 nm. Co-localization was performed with sequential scanning for both the channels and then merged together to obtain overlapping signals. FIG. 3 shows the sub-cellular localization of OsAlba1-GFP fusion protein. It can be seen that GFP expression shows accumulation in nucleus (FIG. 3D), and sparsely in the cytoplasm, compared to control GFP alone (FIG. 3A). FIGS. 3B, and 3E are phase contrast images of same cells as FIG. 3A, D. FIG. 3C, F are merged images of FIGS. 3A, B and D, E respectively. To determine the organ-specific expression of OsAlba1, transcript abundance in roots, stems, leaves, flag leaves, sheaths and panicles of rice seedlings were compared. The transcripts were abundantly and constantly transcribed in flag leaves. The expression in other major vegetative organs was substantially low (FIG. 1). Next, the protein abundance in all these tissues was examined by immunoblot analysis (FIG. 2). The results showed the presence of OsAlba1 in leaves and flag leaves, corroborating the mRNA profile. The predominant expression of OsAlba1 in the flag leaves seems to support the growing panicles which might be crucial during grain filling. The rice flag leaves are essential in providing photosynthates (Xu et al., PloS One, 2011, 6, e176133) and has been reported to play an important role in grain yield (Wan et al., Scienctia Agricultura Sinica, 1981, 6, 21-28; Raj et al., Indian J. Plant Physiol., 2000, 5, 293-295) and in enhancing productivity (Padmaja, Indian J. Plant Physiol., 1991, 34, 339-348). These results may have important implications, since such organ-specific gene expression is closely related to harvest yield, and perhaps crucial for driving agronomic trait/s. Example 6 Complementation Study in Yeast S. cerevisiae wild-type (BY4743) and ΔPop6 (YGR030c) strains were used for complementation assay. ΔPop6 was transformed with pYES2 vector and pYES2 vector containing the OsAlba1 ORF. Yeast strains were grown in YPD broth and serial dilutions [OD600=0.5, as 10° to 10−3 for ΔPop6] were prepared and plated. The plates were incubated at 30° C. for 48 h. The growth of wild-type (WT), ΔPop6:pYES2, ΔPop6, and ΔPop6+OsAlba1 strains were checked under normal conditions, as well as under H2O2-induced oxidative stress conditions. Ribonuclease P/MRP subunit Pop6, a component of ribonuclease P, is an Alba domain containing protein involved in RNA processing (Mani et al., PLoS One., 2011, 6, e22463). However, the role of Alba super family proteins in stress tolerance remains unexplored. It is well known that oxidative stress is caused by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage various cellular components, including proteins, lipids and DNA. We thought that OsAlba1, being a DNA-binding protein, might be involved in defense against oxidative damage and therefore, its role in oxidative stress tolerance was investigated. We examined whether OsAlba1 could complement yeast ΔPop6 mutant under oxidative stress. FIG. 4 shows that the growth of wild-type (WT), ΔPop6:pYES2, ΔPop6 and complemented (ΔPop6+OsAlba1) strains was monitored in presence of different concentrations of H2O2. The complemented strains grew rapidly and displayed resistance when compared with that of ΔPop6 and ΔPop6:pYES2, and the effect was more prominent at higher concentration of H2O2. These results indicate the role of Alba proteins in oxidative stress tolerance, besides their classical role as DNA/RNA-binding proteins. Example 7 Plant Growth Conditions and Stress Treatments Rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) seedlings were grown in pots containing a mixture of soil and soilrite (2:1, w/w; 10 plants/5.6-l-capacity pot) in an environmentally controlled growth room. The seedlings were maintained at 28±2° C., 70±5% relative humidity under a 16 h photoperiod (270 μmol/m2/second light intensity). The pots were provided with 300 ml of water every day to maintain the soil moisture content at ˜30%. Dehydration stress was imposed on the 4-week-old seedlings by withdrawing water, and tissues were harvested up to 120 h. In a separate set of experiment, the seedlings were supplemented with half-Hoagland's medium until 4 weeks, followed by treatment with 250 mM NaCl in the medium. The tissues were harvested until 24 h of the treatment. The ABA treatment was carried out by spraying the seedlings with 100 μM ABA, and tissues were harvested at specified intervals. The unstressed seedlings were sprayed with water, referred to as 0 h. For cold treatment, seedlings were kept at 4° C. for a period of 24 h. In order to investigate transcriptional regulation of OsAlba1 under dehydration, we carried out Northern blot analysis (FIG. 5). The OsAlba1 transcripts were induced during 48-96 h, but dropped to steady state level at 120 h of dehydration (FIG. 5A). The discrepancy between the transcript abundance and the protein profile (FIG. 5B) is not unprecedented and suggests posttranscriptional and/or posttranslational regulation of OsAlba1 during stress. Because dehydration-responsive pathway often overlaps with that of ABA, and dehydration represents a common stress challenge to plant cells under high salinity and cold conditions (Thomashow, Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999, 50, 571-599, Shinozaki et al., Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 3, 2000, 217-223; Xiong et al., Plant Cell Environ., 2002, 25, 131-139), the expression of OsAlba1 transcripts was investigated triggered by each of these conditions. A persistent induction of OsAlba1 was observed under cold, with maximum transcript accumulation at 12 h of stimulation. Even at 24 h of cold treatment, the mRNA level remained elevated when compared with the unstressed condition (FIG. 5D). Treatment with 250 mM NaCl resulted in somewhat more transient mRNA elevation that declined within 24 h (FIG. 5C). Next, we examined whether OsAlba1 transcription was affected by ABA, and it appeared to be induced until 12 h of treatment (FIG. 5E). These results altogether suggest that OsAlba1 may actively participate in osmotic and hyper-osmotic stress, and this participation may, in part, depend on ABA. Example 8 Structural Organization of OsAlba1 To investigate the genomic organization of OsAlba1, the NCBI sequence database was reviewed. It revealed the presence of an incomplete transcript with a coding region of 0.407 kb, identical to Alba protein from Oryza sativa ssp. japonica. The corresponding sequence was used to design primers and full-length cDNA was cloned from O. sativa ssp. indica. The analysis revealed a 52 bp sequence missing at 3′-end, identical to O. sativa ssp. japonica. The complete OsAlba1 genomic sequence is thus 1.514 kb, excluding 3′-UTR region, and interrupted by 4 introns. The coding region of OsAlba1 encodes a protein of 152 amino acids with molecular mass of 16.72 kDa. The domain architecture and putative post translational modifications were examined using NCBI CDD server for domain prediction and NetPhos 2.0 for predicting the phosphorylation sites. The deduced protein sequence analysis and domain search indicated that OsAlba1 comprises of 64 amino acid residue Alba domain (Pfam Accession: PF01918). OsAlba1 showed a high score phosphorylation, both within the Alba domain (Thr-50, Tyr-57 and Ser-104) and outside it (Ser-40 and Ser-129) (FIG. 6). Phosphorylation has previously been observed in Alba proteins of Pop7 and RPP25 family from mouse and human and is documented in UniProt database. Using ASEB server, acetylation and deacetylation sites (acetylation, 136; deacetylation, 107) in OsAlba1 were also predicted. Acetylation and deacetylation events have earlier been reported to have important roles in differential regulation (Chene et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 2012, 40, 3066-3077) and a similar mechanism of differential regulation of OsAlba1 by PTM could therefore be suggested. Example 9 Rice Transformation Agrobacterium Strains and Construct Used for Transformation The OsAlba1 gene was cloned in pGA3426 (FIG. 7) plant transformation vector at XbaI-KpnI restriction sites between the maize Ubi promoter and nos terminator. This vector has tet (tetracycline) and hph (hygromycin) genes as the selectable markers for bacteria and plants, respectively. The gene construct was finally transformed in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, GV3101. Primary culture of Agrobacterium was prepared by inoculating a single colony from a freshly streaked plate, in 5 ml of YEP medium (10 g/l bactopeptone, 10 g/l yeast extract, 5 g/l sodium chloride, pH adjusted 7.0) supplemented with 10 mg/l tetracycline and 10 mg/l rifampicin. The culture was incubated at 28° C. for 16-20 h on a rotatory incubator shaker at 200 rpm. Secondary culture was prepared in a 500 ml baffled flask containing 100 ml YEP by adding 1.0% of the primary culture and grown under similar conditions. Once the O.D.600 reached ˜1.0, Agrobacterium cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 8000×g for 15 min at 4° C. The cells were resuspended in MS resuspension medium containing 150 μM acetosyringone to adjust the O.D.600 of the bacterial suspension to 0.3. Agrobacterium Mediated Callus Transformation and Regeneration The 2-week-old rice calli were collected and Agro-infected by immersing them in the Agrobacterium culture for 20-25 min with intermittent gentle shaking. The Agro-infected calli were dried on sterile Whatman filter paper for 5 min. Calli were then transferred to the co-cultivation medium containing 30 g/L sucrose, 150 μM acetosyringone and incubated at 27±1° C. in the dark for 3 d. Once slight growth of Agrobacterium appeared around most of the calli, the calli were rinsed 8-10 times with 250 mg/L cefotaxime. They were then dried on sterile Whatman filter paper and transferred onto first selection shooting medium (MS medium, BAP 3 mg/l, NAA 1 mg/l, 250 mg/l cefotaxime and 50 mg/l hygromycin and incubated for 12 d at 26±1° C. in dark. After the first selection, brown or black calli were removed, and only creamish healthy calli were transferred to the second selection and maintained at 26±1° C. in dark. After second selection for 10 d, microcalli could be observed which were finally transferred to fresh MS shooting media for third selection and allowed to proliferate for 5 d at 27±1° C. in dark. Healthy shoots with defined stem were transferred to rooting medium (MS medium supplemented with IBA 1 mg/l, 50 mg/l hygromycin, 500 mg/l cefotaxime, pH 5.6) and incubated at 28° C. under continuous light. The plantlets with well-developed root system were planted in 250 ml plastic pots containing autoclaved mud, collected from rice fields. The plantlets were established in such a way that the clump of plantlets, originated from each callus, was separated carefully and planted in several pots. Out of different transgenic lines obtained, five independent transgenic lines harbouring OsAlba1 were screened for further analyses. Example 10 Analysis of OsAlba1 Over-Expressing Transgenic Plants for Stress Tolerance The wild type and the transgenic plants are being studied in parallel in the same growth room for comparative morpho-anatomical, molecular, and physiological analyses. The rice seedlings have been grown in pots containing a mixture of soil and soilrite (2:1, w/w; 5.6-liter-capacity pot) in an environmentally controlled growth room. The seedlings are maintained at 28±2° C., 70±5% relative humidity under a 16 h photoperiod (270 μmol m−2 s−1 light intensity). The pots are provided with 300 ml of water every day that maintained the soil moisture content at 30%. Dehydration is imposed on the 4-week-old seedlings by withdrawing water, and tissues will be harvested up to 120 h. The harvested tissues will be instantly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80° C. unless otherwise described. In a separate set of experiment, the seedlings have been supplemented with half-Hoagland's medium for 3 weeks, followed by treatment with 250 mM concentration of NaCl in the same medium. The tissues will be harvested 24 h after the treatment. The treatment of ABA will be carried out by spraying the seedlings with 100 μM ABA, and tissues will be harvested at specified intervals. For cold treatment, seedlings have been kept at 4° C. for 24 h. The transcript analysis of OsAlba1 for its differential expression under various stresses will be carried out by Northern blot and quantitative real-time PCR.
