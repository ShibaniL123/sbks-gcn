The invention relates to bimesogenic compounds of formula I wherein R11, R12, MG11, MG12 and Sp1 have the meaning given herein below, to the use of bimesogenic compounds of formula I in liquid crystal media and particular to flexoelectric liquid crystal devices comprising a liquid crystal medium according to the present invention. Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) are widely used to display information. LCDs are used for direct view displays, as well as for projection type displays. The electro-optical mode which is employed for most displays still is the twisted nematic (TN)-mode with its various modifications. Besides this mode, the super twisted nematic (STN)-mode and more recently the optically compensated bend (OCB)-mode and the electrically controlled birefringence (ECB)-mode with their various modifications, as e. g. the vertically aligned nematic (VAN), the patterned ITO vertically aligned nematic (PVA)-, the polymer stabilized vertically aligned nematic (PSVA)-mode and the multi domain vertically aligned nematic (MVA)-mode, as well as others, have been increasingly used. All these modes use an electrical field, which is substantially perpendicular to the substrates, respectively to the liquid crystal layer. Besides these modes there are also electro-optical modes employing an electrical field substantially parallel to the substrates, respectively the liquid crystal layer, like e.g. the In Plane Switching (short IPS) mode (as disclosed e.g. in DE 40 00 451 and EP 0 588 568) and the Fringe Field Switching (FFS) mode. Especially the latter mentioned electro-optical modes, which have good viewing angle properties and improved response times, are increasingly used for LCDs for modern desktop monitors and even for displays for TV and for multimedia applications and thus are competing with the TN-LCDs. Further to these displays, new display modes using cholesteric liquid crystals having a relatively short cholesteric pitch have been proposed for use in displays exploiting the so called “flexo-electric” effect. The term “liquid crystal”, “mesomorphic compound” or “mesogenic compound” (also shortly referred to as “mesogen”) means a compound that under suitable conditions of temperature, pressure and concentration can exist as a mesophase (nematic, smectic, etc.) or in particular as a LC phase. Non-amphiphilic mesogenic compounds comprise for example one or more calamitic, banana-shaped or discotic mesogenic groups. Flexoelectric liquid crystal materials are known in prior art. The flexoelectric effect is described inter alia by Chandrasekhar, “Liquid Crystals”, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press (1992) and P. G. deGennes et al., “The Physics of Liquid Crystals”, 2nd edition, Oxford Science Publications (1995). In these displays the cholesteric liquid crystals are oriented in the “uniformly lying helix” arrangement (ULH), which also give this display mode its name. For this purpose, a chiral substance which is mixed with a nematic material induces a helical twist transforming the material into a chiral nematic material, which is equivalent to a cholesteric material. The term “chiral” in general is used to describe an object that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. “Achiral” (non-chiral) objects are objects that are identical to their mirror image. The terms chiral nematic and cholesteric are used synonymously in this application, unless explicitly stated otherwise. The pitch induced by the chiral substance (P0) is in a first approximation inversely proportional to the concentration (c) of the chiral material used. The constant of proportionality of this relation is called the helical twisting power (HTP) of the chiral substance and defined by equation (1) [in-line-formulae]HTP≡1/(c·P0) (1)[/in-line-formulae] wherein c is the concentration of the chiral compound. The uniform lying helix texture is realized using a chiral nematic liquid crystal with a short pitch, typically in the range from 0.2 μm to 1 μm, preferably of 1.0 μm or less, in particular of 0.5 μm or less, which is unidirectional aligned with its helical axis parallel to the substrates, e. g. glass plates, of a liquid crystal cell. In this configuration the helical axis of the chiral nematic liquid crystal is equivalent to the optical axis of a birefringent plate. If an electrical field is applied to this configuration normal to the helical axis the optical axis is rotated in the plane of the cell, similar as the director of a ferroelectric liquid crystal rotate as in a surface stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal display. The flexoelectric effect is characterized by fast response times typically ranging from 6 μs to 100 μs. It further features excellent grey scale capability. The field induces a splay bend structure in the director which is accommodated by a tilt in the optical axis. The angle of the rotation of the axis is in first approximation directly and linearly proportional to the strength of the electrical field. The optical effect is best seen when the liquid crystal cell is placed between crossed polarizers with the optical axis in the unpowered state at an angle of 22.5° to the absorption axis of one of the polarizers. This angle of 22.5° is also the ideal angle of rotation of the electric field, as thus, by the inversion the electrical field, the optical axis is rotated by 45° and by appropriate selection of the relative orientations of the preferred direction of the axis of the helix, the absorption axis of the polarizer and the direction of the electric field, the optical axis can be switched from parallel to one polarizer to the center angle between both polarizers. The optimum contrast is then achieved when the total angle of the switching of the optical axis is 45°. In that case the arrangement can be used as a switchable quarter wave plate, provided the optical retardation, i. e. the product of the effective birefringence of the liquid crystal and the cell gap, is selected to be the quarter of the wave length. In this context the wavelength referred to is 550 nm, the wavelength for which the sensitivity of the human eye is highest, unless explicitly stated otherwise. The angle of rotation of the optical axis (Φ) is given in good approximation by formula (2) [in-line-formulae]tan Φ=ēP0E/(2πK) (2)[/in-line-formulae] wherein P0 is the undisturbed pitch of the cholesteric liquid crystal,ē is the average [ē=½(espay+ebend)] of the splay flexoelectric coefficient (esplay) and the bend flexoelectric coefficient (ebend),E is the electrical field strength andK is the average [K=½(k11+k33)] of the splay elastic constant (k11) and the bend elastic constant (K33)and whereinē/K is called the flexo-elastic ratio. This angle of rotation is half the switching angle in a flexoelectric switching element. The response time (τ) of this electro-optical effect is given in good approximation by formula (3) [in-line-formulae]τ=[P0/(2π)]2·γ/K (3)[/in-line-formulae] wherein γ is the effective viscosity coefficient associated with the distortion of the helix. There is a critical field (Ec) to unwind the helix, which can be obtained from equation (4) [in-line-formulae]Ec=(π2/P0)·[k22/(∈0·Δ∈)]1/2 (4)[/in-line-formulae] wherein k22 is the twist elastic constant,∈0 is the permittivity of vacuum andΔ∈ is the dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal. In this mode, however several problems still have to be resolved, which are, amongst others, difficulties in obtaining the required uniform orientation, an unfavorably high voltage required for addressing, which is incompatible with common driving electronics, a not really dark “off state”, which deteriorates the contrast, and, last not least, a pronounced hysteresis in the electro-optical characteristics. A relatively new display mode, the so-called uniformly standing helix (USH) mode, may be considered as an alternative mode to succeed the IPS, as it can show improved black levels, even compared to other display mode providing wide viewing angles (e.g. IPS, VA etc.). For the USH mode, like for the ULH mode, flexoelectric switching has been proposed, using bimesogenic liquid crystal materials. Bimesogenic compounds are known in general from prior art (cf. also Hori, K., Iimuro, M., Nakao, A., Toriumi, H., J. Mol. Struc. 2004, 699, 23-29). The term “bimesogenic compound” relates to compounds comprising two mesogenic groups in the molecule. Just like normal mesogens they can form many mesophases, depending on their structure. In particular compounds of formula I induce a second nematic phase, when added to a nematic liquid crystal medium. The term “mesogenic group” means in this context, a group with the ability to induce liquid crystal (LC) phase behaviour. The compounds comprising mesogenic groups do not necessarily have to exhibit an LC phase themselves. It is also possible that they show LC phase behaviour only in mixtures with other compounds. For the sake of simplicity, the term “liquid crystal” is used hereinafter for both mesogenic and LC materials. However, due to the unfavorably high driving voltage required, to the relatively narrow phase range of the chiral nematic materials and to their irreversible switching properties, materials from prior art are not compatible for the use with current LCD driving schemes. For displays of the USH and ULH mode, new liquid crystalline media with improved properties are required. Especially the birefringence (Δn) should be optimized for the optical mode. The birefringence Δn herein is defined in equation (5) [in-line-formulae]Δn=ne−no (5)[/in-line-formulae] wherein ne is the extraordinary refractive index and no is the ordinary refractive index, and the average refractive index nav, is given by the following equation (6). [in-line-formulae]nav.=[(2no2+ne2)/3]1/2 (6)[/in-line-formulae] The extraordinary refractive index ne and the ordinary refractive index no can be measured using an Abbe refractometer. Δn can then be calculated from equation (5). Furthermore, for displays utilizing the USH or ULH mode the optical retardation d*Δn (effective) of the liquid crystal media should preferably be such that the equation (7) [in-line-formulae]sin 2(π·d·Δn/λ)=1 (7)[/in-line-formulae] wherein d is the cell gap andλ is the wave length of light is satisfied. The allowance of deviation for the right hand side of equation (7) is +/−3%. The wave length of light generally referred to in this application is 550 nm, unless explicitly specified otherwise. The cell gap of the cells preferably is in the range from 1 μm to 20 μm, in particular within the range from 2.0 μm to 10 μm. For the ULH/USH mode, the dielectric anisotropy (Δ∈) should be as small as possible, to prevent unwinding of the helix upon application of the addressing voltage. Preferably Δ∈ should be slightly higher than 0 and very preferably be 0.1 or more, but preferably 10 or less, more preferably 7 or less and most preferably 5 or less. In the present application the term “dielectrically positive” is used for compounds or components with Δ∈>3.0, “dielectrically neutral” with −1.5≦Δ∈≦3.0 and “dielectrically negative” with Δ∈<−1.5. Δ∈ is determined at a frequency of 1 kHz and at 20° C. The dielectric anisotropy of the respective compound is determined from the results of a solution of 10% of the respective individual compound in a nematic host mixture. In case the solubility of the respective compound in the host medium is less than 10% its concentration is reduced by a factor of 2 until the resultant medium is stable enough at least to allow the determination of its properties. Preferably the concentration is kept at least at 5%, however, in order to keep the significance of the results a high as possible. The capacitance of the test mixtures are determined both in a cell with homeotropic and with homogeneous alignment. The cell gap of both types of cells is approximately 20 μm. The voltage applied is a rectangular wave with a frequency of 1 kHz and a root mean square value typically of 0.5 V to 1.0 V, however, it is always selected to be below the capacitive threshold of the respective test mixture. Δ∈ is defined as (∈∥−∈⊥), whereas ∈av. is (∈∥+2∈⊥)/3. The dielectric permittivity of the compounds is determined from the change of the respective values of a host medium upon addition of the compounds of interest. The values are extrapolated to a concentration of the compounds of interest of 100%. A typical The host mixture is disclosed in H. J. Coles et al., J. Appl. Phys. 2006, 99, 034104 and has the composition given in the table. TABLE 1 Host mixture composition Compound Concentration F-PGI-ZI9Z-GP-F 25% F-PGI-ZI11Z-GP-F 25% F-PGI-O5O-PP-N 9.5% F-PGI-O7O-PP-N 39% CD-1 1.5% Besides the above mentioned parameters, the media have to exhibit a suitably wide range of the nematic phase, a rather small rotational viscosity and an at least moderately high specific resistivity. Similar liquid crystal compositions with short cholesteric pitch for flexoelectric devices are known from EP 0 971 016, GB 2 356 629 and Coles, H. J., Musgrave, B., Coles, M. J., and Willmott, J., J. Mater. Chem., 11, p. 2709-2716 (2001). EP 0 971 016 reports on mesogenic estradiols, which, as such, have a high flexoelectric coefficient. GB 2 356 629 suggests the use of bimesogenic compounds in flexoelectric devices. The flexoelectric effect herein has been investigated in pure cholesteric liquid crystal compounds and in mixtures of homologous compounds only so far. Most of these compounds were used in binary mixtures consisting of a chiral additive and a nematic liquid crystal material being either a simple, conventional monomesogenic material or a bimesogenic one. These materials do have several drawbacks for practical applications, like insufficiently wide temperature ranges of the chiral nematic—or cholesteric phase, too small flexoelectric ratios, small angles of rotation. Symmetrical dimeric compounds showing liquid crystalline behaviour are disclosed in Joo-Hoon Park et al. “Liquid Crystalline Properties of Dimers Having o-, m- and p-Positional Molecular structures”, Bill. Korean Chem. Soc., 2012, Vol. 33, No. 5, pp. 1647-1652. One aim of the invention was to provide improved flexoelectric devices that exhibit high switching angles and fast response times. Another aim was to provide liquid crystal materials with advantageous properties, in particular for use in flexoelectric displays that enable good uniform alignment over the entire area of the display cell without the use of a mechanical shearing process, good contrast, high switching angles and fast response times also at low temperatures. The liquid crystal mixtures and preferably also the single compounds should exhibit low melting points, broad chiral nematic phase ranges, short temperature independent pitch lengths and high flexoelectric coefficients. Other aims of the present invention are immediately evident to the person skilled in the art from the following detailed description. The inventors have found out that the above aims can be surprisingly achieved by providing bimesogenic compounds according to the present invention. These compounds, when used in chiral nematic liquid crystal mixtures, lead to low melting points, broad chiral nematic phases. In particular, they exhibit relatively high values of the elastic constant k11, low values of the bend elastic constant k33 and high values of the flexoelectric coefficient.

Another object of the invention is the use of bimesogenic compounds of formula I in liquid crystalline media. Compounds of formula I, when added to a nematic liquid crystalline mixture, producing a phase below the nematic. In this context, a first indication of the influence of bimesogenic compounds on nematic liquid crystal mixtures was reported by Barnes, P. J., Douglas, A. G., Heeks, S. K., Luckhurst, G. R., Liquid Crystals, 1993, Vol. 13, No. 4, 603-613. This reference exemplifies highly polar alkyl spacered dimers and perceives a phase below the nematic, concluding it is a type of smectic. A photo evidence of an existing mesophase below the nematic phase was published by Henderson, P. A., Niemeyer, O., Imrie, C. T. in Liquid Crystals, 2001, Vol. 28, No. 3, 463-472, which was not further investigated. In Liquid Crystals, 2005, Vol. 32, No. 11-12, 1499-1513 Henderson, P. A., Seddon, J. M. and Imrie, C. T. reported, that the new phase below the nematic belonged in some special examples to a smectic C phase. A additional nematic phase below the first nematic was reported by Panov, V. P., Ngaraj, M., Vij, J. K., Panarin, Y. P., Kohlmeier, A., Tamba, M. G., Lewis, R. A. and Mehl, G. H. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 2010, 105, 1678011-1678014. In this context, liquid crystal mixtures comprising the new and inventive bimesogenic compounds of formula I show also a novel mesophase that is being assigned as a second nematic phase. This mesophase exists at a lower temperature than the original nematic liquid crystalline phase and has been observed in the unique mixture concepts presented by this application. Accordingly, the bimesogenic compounds of formula I according to the present invention allow the second nematic phase to be induced in nematic mixtures that do not have this phase normally. Furthermore, varying the amounts of compounds of formula I allow the phase behaviour of the second nematic to be tailored to the required temperature. The invention thus relates to a liquid-crystalline medium which comprises at least one compound of the formula I.

Especially preferred are chiral dopants with a high helical twisting power (HTP), in particular those disclosed in WO 98/00428. Further typically used chiral dopants are e.g. the commercially available R/S-5011, CD-1, R/S-811 and CB-15 (from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The above mentioned chiral compounds R/S-5011 and CD-1 and the compounds of formula IV and V exhibit a very high helical twisting power (HTP), and are therefore particularly useful for the purpose of the present invention. The liquid crystalline medium preferably comprises preferably 1 to 5, in particular 1 to 3, very preferably 1 or 2 chiral dopants, preferably selected from the above formula IV, in particular CD-1, and/or formula V and/or R-5011 or S-5011, very preferably the chiral compound is R-5011, S-5011 or CD-1. The amount of chiral compounds in the liquid crystalline medium is preferably from 1 to 20%, in particular from 1 to 15%, very preferably 1 to 10% by weight of the total mixture. Further preferred are liquid crystalline media comprising one or more additives selected from the following formula VI wherein R5 is alkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl or alkenyloxy with up to 12 C atoms, is L1 through L4 are each independently H or F, Z2 is —COO—, —CH2CH2— or a single bond, m is 1 or 2 Particularly preferred compounds of formula VI are selected from the following formulae wherein, R has one of the meanings of R5 above and L1, L2 and L3 have the above meanings.

The liquid crystal media according to the present invention may contain further additives in usual concentrations. The total concentration of these further constituents is in the range of 0.1% to 10%, preferably 0.1% to 6%, based on the total mixture. The concentrations of the individual compounds used each are preferably in the range of 0.1% to 3%. The concentration of these and of similar additives is not taken into consideration for the values and ranges of the concentrations of the liquid crystal components and compounds of the liquid crystal media in this application. This also holds for the concentration of the dichroic dyes used in the mixtures, which are not counted when the concentrations of the compounds respectively the components of the host medium are specified. The concentration of the respective additives is always given relative to the final doped mixture. The liquid crystal media according to the present invention consists of several compounds, preferably of 3 to 30, more preferably of 4 to 20 and most preferably of 4 to 16 compounds. These compounds are mixed in conventional way. As a rule, the required amount of the compound used in the smaller amount is dissolved in the compound used in the greater amount. In case the temperature is above the clearing point of the compound used in the higher concentration, it is particularly easy to observe completion of the process of dissolution. It is, however, also possible to prepare the media by other conventional ways, e.g. using so called pre-mixtures, which can be e.g. homologous or eutectic mixtures of compounds or using so called multi-bottle-systems, the constituents of which are ready to use mixtures themselves.

The bimesogenic compounds of formula I and the liquid crystalline media comprising them can be used in liquid crystal displays, such as STN, TN, AMD-TN, temperature compensation, guest-host, phase change or surface stabilized or polymer stabilized cholesteric texture (SSCT, PSCT) displays, in particular in flexoelectric devices, in active and passive optical elements like polarizers, compensators, reflectors, alignment layers, color filters or holographic elements, in adhesives, synthetic resins with anisotropic mechanical properties, cosmetics, diagnostics, liquid crystal pigments, for decorative and security applications, in nonlinear optics, optical information storage or as chiral dopants. The compounds of formula I and the mixtures obtainable thereof are particularly useful for flexoelectric liquid crystal display. Thus, another object of the present invention is a flexoelectric display comprising one or more compounds of formula I or comprising a liquid crystal medium comprising one or more compounds of formula I. The inventive bimesogenic compounds of formula I and the mixtures thereof can be aligned in their cholesteric phase into different states of orientation by methods that are known to the expert, such as surface treatment or electric fields. For example, they can be aligned into the planar (Grandjean) state, into the focal conic state or into the homeotropic state. Inventive compounds of formula I comprising polar groups with a strong dipole moment can further be subjected to flexoelectric switching, and can thus be used in electrooptical switches or liquid crystal displays. The switching between different states of orientation according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is exemplarily described below in detail for a sample of an inventive compound of formula I. According to this preferred embodiment, the sample is placed into a cell comprising two plane-parallel glass plates coated with electrode layers, e.g. ITO layers, and aligned in its cholesteric phase into a planar state wherein the axis of the cholesteric helix is oriented normal to the cell walls. This state is also known as Grandjean state, and the texture of the sample, which is observable e.g. in a polarization microscope, as Grandjean texture. Planar alignment can be achieved e.g. by surface treatment of the cell walls, for example by rubbing and/or coating with an alignment layer such as polyimide. A Grandjean state with a high quality of alignment and only few defects can further be achieved by heating the sample to the isotropic phase, subsequently cooling to the chiral nematic phase at a temperature close to the chiral nematic-isotropic phase transition, and rubbing the cell. In the planar state, the sample shows selective reflection of incident light, with the central wavelength of reflection depending on the helical pitch and the mean refractive index of the material. When an electric field is applied to the electrodes, for example with a frequency from 10 Hz to 1 kHz, and an amplitude of up to 12 Vrms/m, the sample is being switched into a homeotropic state where the helix is unwound and the molecules are oriented parallel to the field, i.e. normal to the plane of the electrodes. In the homeotropic state, the sample is transmissive when viewed in normal daylight, and appears black when being put between crossed polarizers. Upon reduction or removal of the electric field in the homeotropic state, the sample adopts a focal conic texture, where the molecules exhibit a helically twisted structure with the helical axis being oriented perpendicular to the field, i.e. parallel to the plane of the electrodes. A focal conic state can also be achieved by applying only a weak electric field to a sample in its planar state. In the focal conic state the sample is scattering when viewed in normal daylight and appears bright between crossed polarizers. A sample of an inventive compound in the different states of orientation exhibits different transmission of light. Therefore, the respective state of orientation, as well as its quality of alignment, can be controlled by measuring the light transmission of the sample depending on the strength of the applied electric field. Thereby it is also possible to determine the electric field strength required to achieve specific states of orientation and transitions between these different states. In a sample of an inventive compound of formula I, the above described focal conic state consists of many disordered birefringent small domains. By applying an electric field greater than the field for nucleation of the focal conic texture, preferably with additional shearing of the cell, a uniformly aligned texture is achieved where the helical axis is parallel to the plane of the electrodes in large, well-aligned areas. In accordance with the literature on state of the art chiral nematic materials, such as P. Rudquist et al., Liq. Cryst. 23 (4), 503 (1997), this texture is also called uniformly-lying helix (ULH) texture. This texture is required to characterize the flexoelectric properties of the inventive compound. The sequence of textures typically observed in a sample of an inventive compound of formula I on a rubbed polyimide substrate upon increasing or decreasing electric field is given below: Starting from the ULH texture, the inventive flexoelectric compounds and mixtures can be subjected to flexoelectric switching by application of an electric field. This causes rotation of the optic axis of the material in the plane of the cell substrates, which leads to a change in transmission when placing the material between crossed polarizers. The flexoelectric switching of inventive materials is further described in detail in the introduction above and in the examples. It is also possible to obtain the ULH texture, starting from the focal conic texture, by applying an electric field with a high frequency, of for example 10 kHz, to the sample whilst cooling slowly from the isotropic phase into the cholesteric phase and shearing the cell. The field frequency may differ for different compounds. The bimesogenic compounds of formula I are particularly useful in flexoelectric liquid crystal displays as they can easily be aligned into macroscopically uniform orientation, and lead to high values of the elastic constant k11 and a high flexoelectric coefficient e in the liquid crystal medium. The liquid crystal medium preferably exhibits a k11<1×10−10 N, preferably <2×10−11 N, and a flexoelectric coefficient e>1×10−11 C/m, preferably >1×10−10 C/m. Apart from the use in flexoelectric devices, the inventive bimesogenic compounds as well as mixtures thereof are also suitable for other types of displays and other optical and electrooptical applications, such as optical compensation or polarizing films, color filters, reflective cholesterics, optical rotatory power and optical information storage. A further aspect of the present invention relates to a display cell wherein the cell walls exhibit hybrid alignment conditions. The term “hybrid alignment” or orientation of a liquid crystal or mesogenic material in a display cell or between two substrates means that the mesogenic groups adjacent to the first cell wall or on the first substrate exhibit homeotropic orientation and the mesogenic groups adjacent to the second cell wall or on the second substrate exhibit planar orientation. The term “homeotropic alignment” or orientation of a liquid crystal or mesogenic material in a display cell or on a substrate means that the mesogenic groups in the liquid crystal or mesogenic material are oriented substantially perpendicular to the plane of the cell or substrate, respectively. The term “planar alignment” or orientation of a liquid crystal or mesogenic material in a display cell or on a substrate means that the mesogenic groups in the liquid crystal or mesogenic material are oriented substantially parallel to the plane of the cell or substrate, respectively. A flexoelectric display according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises two plane parallel substrates, preferably glass plates covered with a transparent conductive layer such as indium tin oxide (ITO) on their inner surfaces, and a flexoelectric liquid crystalline medium provided between the substrates, characterized in that one of the inner substrate surfaces exhibits homeotropic alignment conditions and the opposite inner substrate surface exhibits planar alignment conditions for the liquid crystalline medium. Planar alignment can be achieved e.g. by means of an alignment layer, for example a layer of rubbed polyimide or sputtered SiOx, that is applied on top of the substrate. Alternatively it is possible to directly rub the substrate, i.e. without applying an additional alignment layer. For example, rubbing can be achieved by means of a rubbing cloth, such as a velvet cloth, or with a flat bar coated with a rubbing cloth. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention rubbing is achieved by means of a at least one rubbing roller, like e.g. a fast spinning roller that is brushing across the substrate, or by putting the substrate between at least two rollers, wherein in each case at least one of the rollers is optionally covered with a rubbing cloth. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention rubbing is achieved by wrapping the substrate at least partially at a defined angle around a roller that is preferably coated with a rubbing cloth. Homeotropic alignment can be achieved e.g. by means of an alignment layer coated on top of the substrate. Suitable aligning agents used on glass substrates are for example alkyltrichlorosilane or lecithine, whereas for plastic substrate thin layers of lecithine, silica or high tilt polyimide orientation films as aligning agents may be used. In a preferred embodiment of the invention silica coated plastic film is used as a substrate. Further suitable methods to achieve planar or homeotropic alignment are described for example in J. Cognard, Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst. 78, Supplement 1, 1-77 (1981). By using a display cell with hybrid alignment conditions, a very high switching angle of flexoelectric switching, fast response times and a good contrast can be achieved. The flexoelectric display according to present invention may also comprise plastic substrates instead of glass substrates. Plastic film substrates are particularly suitable for rubbing treatment by rubbing rollers as described above. Another object of the present invention is that compounds of formula I, when added to a nematic liquid crystalline mixture, produce a phase below the nematic. Accordingly, the bimesogenic compounds of formula I according to the present invention allow the second nematic phase to be induced in nematic mixtures that do not show evidence of this phase normally. Furthermore, varying the amounts of compounds of formula I allow the phase behaviour of the second nematic to be tailored to the required temperature. Examples for this are given and the mixtures obtainable thereof are particularly useful for flexoelectric liquid crystal display. Thus, another object of the present invention is liquid crystal media comprising one or more compounds of formula I exhibiting a second nematic phase.

The flask is evacuated and refilled with nitrogen 3 times. Bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride (1.1 g, 1.581 mmol), copper iodide (0.23 g, 1.25 mmol) and diisopropylamine (30 mL) are added into the flask. The flask is evacuated and refilled with nitrogen gas. Then it is treated in an ultrasonic bath to degas the reaction mixture, a procedure shortly referred to as “ultrasonication” or shortly “sonication” in this application, for 30 minutes. 1,3-Bromoiodobenzene (29.4 g, 104.0 mmol) is dissolved in THF (50 mL) and added slowly over a time span of 15 minutes. A precipitate forms and the reaction mixture is stirred for 1.5 hours at room temperature, which means a temperature of approximately 20° C. throughout this application, unless explicitly stated otherwise, before it is filtered in vacuo. The filtrate is washed with water and concentrated to give the crude product as an oil. This oil is distilled to remove non reacted nonadiyene and then purified by flash chromatography using silica gel, eluting with 9:1 petrol/diethyl ether. Step 1.2 Conditions for the reaction: (b) Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, CuI, (C2H5)3N, THF. The product from the previous step, step 1.1, (6.7 g, 24.4 mmol) is solved in THF (50 mL) and added into a 250 mL round bottom flask. The flask is evacuated 3 times and refilled with nitrogen. Bis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(II) dichloride (0.065 g, 0.09 mmol), copper iodide (0.014 g, 0.07 mmol) and diisopropylamine (10 mL) are added to the flask. The flask is evacuated and refilled with nitrogen, then sonicated for 30 minutes to degas. 1,4-Bromoiodobenzene (6.8 g, 24.3 mmol) dissolved in THF (50 mL) is added slowly over a time span of 15 minutes. A precipitate is formed and the reaction mixture is stirred for 1.5 hours at room temperature. On completion of the reaction the reaction mixture is filtered and the filtrate is washed with deionised water, dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated. The crude product is purified by flash chromatography through silica gel, eluting with petrol, yielding a pure white solid product. Step 1.3 Conditions for the reaction: (c) Pd(C), H2, THF. The hydrogenation apparatus “H-Cube” from ThalesNano Inc., Budapest, Hungary is equipped with a new Platinum/Carbon catalyst and set to a flow rate 10 mL/min at 20 bar and 40° C. 6.50 g of the product from the previous step, step 1.2, is mixed with THF (200 mL) and fed through the H-cube. Analysis shows the reaction is incomplete. The H-cube is reset to 30 bar and 50° C., the flow rate is kept the same and the solution passed through again, yielding the product. This is carried onto the next step without purification. Step 1.4 Conditions for the reaction: (d) Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, Na2CO3, H2O, THF. The product from the previous step, step, 1.3, (4.50 g, 10.27 mmol) and 4-Cyanophenylboronic acid (4.70 g, 20.5 mmol) are dissolved in 1,4-dioxane (40 mL) in a 250 mL 3-neck round bottom flask. Sodium carbonate (2.08 g, 19.61 mmol) and water (10 mL) are added to the reaction mixture and then (1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) palladium(II)dichloride (0.45 g, 0.61 mmol) is added.

The materials in the above table generally showed increased performance in the screening mixtures, as compared to known, more conventional bimesogenic compounds as e.g. those shown in the table below. Use Examples, Mixture Examples Typically a 5.6 μm thick cell, having an anti-parallel rubbed PI alignment layer, is filled on a hotplate at a temperature at which the flexoelectric mixture in the isotropic phase. After the cell has been filled phase transitions, including clearing point, are measured using Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) and verified by optical inspection. For optical phase transition measurements, a Mettler FP90 hot-stage controller connected to a FP82 hot-stage is used to control the temperature of the cell. The temperature is increased from ambient temperature at a rate of 5 degrees C. per minute, until the onset of the isotropic phase is observed. The texture change is observed through crossed polarizers using an Olympus BX51 microscope and the respective temperature noted. Wires are then attached to the ITO electrodes of the cell using indium metal. The cell is secured in a Linkam THMS600 hot-stage connected to a Linkam TMS93 hot-stage controller. The hot-stage is secured to a rotation stage in an Olympus BX51 microscope. The cell is heated until the liquid crystal is completely isotropic. The cell is then cooled under an applied electric field until the sample is completely nematic. The driving waveform is supplied by a Tektronix AFG3021B arbitrary function generator, which is sent through a Newtons4th LPA400 power amplifier before being applied to the cell. The cell response is monitored with a Thorlabs PDA55 photodiode. Both input waveforms and optical response are measured using a Tektronix TDS 2024B digital oscilloscope. In order to measure the flexoelastic response of the material, the change in the size of the tilt of the optic axis is measured as a function of increasing voltage. This is achieved by using the equation: tan   ϕ = P 0 2  π  e K  E _ wherein φ is the tilt in the optic axis from the original position (i.e. when E=0), E is the applied field, K is the elastic constant (average of K1 and K3) and e is the flexoelectric coefficient (where e=e1+e3). The applied field is monitored using a HP 34401A multimeter. The tilt angle is measured using the aforementioned microscope and oscilloscope. The undisturbed cholesteric pitch, P0, is measured using an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrometer attached to a computer. The selective reflection band is obtained and the pitch determined from the spectral data. The mixtures shown in the following examples are well suitable for use in USH-displays. To that end an appropriate concentration of the chiral dopant or dopants used has to be applied in order to achieve a cholesteric pitch of 200 nm or less.
