WO 2012/013792 CA 02806009 2013-01-18 PCT/EP2011/063130 A TRANSMUCOSAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING ANTHOCYANINS FOR ALLEVIATING A VISUAL DISCOMFORT FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to a composition comprising a natural extract containing anthocyanins and an agent for enhancing vigilance, and a method for alleviating visual discomfort related to or caused by oxidative stress. More specifically, the invention relates to a method for alleviating visual discomfort comprising administering via transmucosal route the composition of the invention. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Oxidative stress corresponds to an excess of oxidant elements as compared to antioxidant products, resulting in structural or formal damages, such as cellular damages. Oxidative stress is linked to an excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) coupled to a deficiency in anti-radical defenses. Several scientific studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress is influenced by genetic factors (Mata et al., Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 2001; 42:1685-90), constitutive factors, such as aging, or environmental risks such as tobacco, UV light exposition or hypercholesterolemia (Wihlmark et al., Free radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22:1229-34; Mares-Peflman et al., Arch Ophthalmol. 1995; 113 (12): 1518-23 ). In retina, the oxidation of lipids linked to amino acids leads to the accumulation of lipofuscine, a fluorescent pigment. Said pigment sensitizes epithelial cells to blue light and induces the production of ROS inducing cell death by apoptosis (Wihlmark et al., Free radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22:1229-34). Moreover, with aging, the catalytic activity of catalase, an antioxidant enzyme participating to antioxidant protection is decreased in the retinal epithelium. WO 2012/013792 CA 02806009 2013-01-18 PCT/EP2011/063130 Consequently, with aging, oxidative damages in the retina may cause a loss of visual function, such as, for example a loss of visual acuity, a poor night vision, an enhanced light sensitivity and glare. A poor visual function, together with a high reaction time (which may result from a loss of vigilance as well as from a visual dysfunction) and a state of hypovigilance is one of the major human risk factor for car crash. Developing compositions maintaining visual function, normal reaction time and vigilance of car drivers may be considered as a public road safety stake. Non-enzymatic antioxidants exist to counterbalance the effect of oxidation, for example in the eye. Said antioxidants are for example carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin...) or anthocyanins which belong to the family of flavonoids. Anthocyanins may be formed of anthocyanosides, such as for example delphinidol, cyanidol, malvidol, petunidol glucosides as well as of quinolizidinic bases. The use of non-enzymatic antioxidant for preventing or treating oxidative stress-related eye disorders or for alleviating visual discomfort related to oxidative stress is wellknown in the art. For example, anthocyanins, which can be extracted from natural vegetal species, such as for example bilberry fruits, present antioxidant properties commonly used in compositions for treating or preventing eye disorders. In vitro, anthocyanins protect retinal cells against oxidative stress (i)utot et al., J Fr Ophtalmol., 2008; 31(10):975-80). WO200577176 discloses the use of anthocyanins for treating or preventing eye diseases such as Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMI)), glaucoma, as well as for increasing the resistance of retinal cells to blue-light damages and for limiting lipofuscine accumulation. US2003/0008048 describes a composition to be ingested, comprising anthocyanins, lutein and vitamin C for helping the body resist the effects of aging process. Anthocyanins are used to be administered through an oral way by ingestion, leading to digestive absorption of the substance. However, said absorption is not efficient, as only about 1% of total anthocyanins are systemically absorbed after oral administration of bilberry extracts containing 25% of anthocyanins. WO 2012/013792 CA 02806009 2013-01-18 PCT/EP2011/063130 Taking into account this issue, this invention aims at improving the bioavailability of anthocyanins present in natural, preferably vegetal, extracts. This improvement of bioavailability carries the further advantage that, according to the invention, the amount of anthocyanins to be administered to a subject for alleviation of visual discomfort is lower than that to be administered by ingestion route. Surprisingly, the Applicant herein shows that the combination of Vitamin C or Caffeine, with anthocyanins, improved the bioavailability of anthocyanins and resulted in an improved alleviation of visual discomfort, especially visual discomfort related to oxidative damages, together with an enhancement of the state of vigilance. Thus, the composition of the invention, comprising anthocyanins and an agent for alleviating vigilance has an effect on visual function, reaction time and vigilance. As such, the composition of the invention may be of particular interest for car drivers. DEFINITIONS In the present invention, the following terms have the following meanings: The term "Nutraceutical" refers to a product isolated or purified from comestibles.

The term "Functional food" refers to any modified food or food ingredient that may provide a benefit or provide protection against physiological disorder or discomfort; beyond the traditional nutrients it contains. As used herein, the expression "Nutraceutically effective amount" refers to the amount of a nutraceutical composition, food or dietary supplement or functional food necessary and sufficient for providing a physiological benefit or alleviating a discomfort. The expression "Pharmaceutically effective amount" refers to the amount of a pharmaceutical composition necessary and sufficient for slowing down or stopping the progression, aggravation, or deterioration of one or more symptoms of a disease, or WO 2012/013792 CA 02806009 2013-01-18 PCT/EP2011/063130 condition; or alleviating the symptoms of a disease or condition; or curing the disease or condition. As used herein, the term "Transmucosal administration" refers to the administration of a product through or across a mucosal tissue. In the meaning of this invention preferred mucosal tissues are buccal, sublingual, gingival and palatal tissues. According to the invention, very preferred transmucosal administration is buccal administration. In this case, the administered substance reaches the systemic circulation through or across the mucosal tissues of the buccal cavity but is not ingested or swallowed. By "Oral administration" is meant the administration of a product in the mouth cavity followed by the swallowing of the product. In this case, the substance reaches the systemic circulation through a digestive absorption. As used herein, an "Orodispersible/orodisintegrating tablet or film" is a tablet or a film for oral administration, whose oral administration results in its dispersion or disintegration within the mouth. As used herein, a "Chewing gum" refers to a type of gum to be chewed formed in many different shapes and sizes (balls, sticks...) and made of a base comprising a natural latex product or synthetic rubber, to which are incorporated food colorings, flavorings, preservatives and other additives. The term "Oxidation" refers to a reaction in which the atoms in an element lose electrons and the valence of the element is correspondingly increased. In a biological context, oxidation is usually linked to the reaction of a substance with oxygen, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species. The term "photo-oxidation" specifically refers to a phenomenon of oxidation facilitated or provoked by light (for example sunlight). The term "Oxidant" refers to an agent that oxidizes another agent. The term "Antioxidant" refers to an agent that decreases or avoids the oxidation of other substances. An antioxidant may protect cells against the effect of reactive oxygen species.

The expression "Photo-receptor overstimulation" refers to an excessive stimulation of the photoreceptor, which could lead to physiological problems. WO 2012/013792 CA 02806009 2013-01-18 PCT/EP2011/063130 As used herein, the term "Comfort" refers to the feeling of ease or well-being. Accordingly, the term "discomfort" refers to the absence or to a decrease in the feeling of ease or well-being. In one embodiment, a discomfort may be related to the presence of pain. In one embodiment, the term "discomfort" may correspond to a loss of visual function, preferably a loss a visual function wherein the visual function becomes incompatible with driving (the requirements in term of visual function for driving are defined in the European Commission directive 2009/113/EC of 25 August 2009). As used herein, the expression "visual function" may encompass one or more of the following features: visual acuity, field of vision, twilight vision, glare and contrast sensitivity and diplopia. Methods for measuring visual function are known from the skilled artisan. For example, visual acuity may be measured by ETDRS acuity testing (ETDRS stands for Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study); field of vision may be measured by perimetry or by the use of a campimeter; glare may be measured by having the subject adjust brightness of a light source until it reaches an ill-defined threshold of unpleasantness... In one embodiment, the term "discomfort" may correspond to symptoms of eye fatigue, which may easily be measured. Examples symptoms of eye fatigue include, but are not limited to, itching, pain, winking, enhanced tear production and the like. In a first embodiment of the invention, the visual discomfort alleviated in the present invention is non-pathological, i.e. is not related to an ocular disease, disorder or condition. According to this embodiment, alleviating a visual discomfort is a nontherapeutic action. In a second embodiment of the invention, the visual discomfort is pathological, i.e. is the symptom of an ocular disease, disorder or condition. Examples of ocular disease, disorder or condition include, but are not limited to age related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, cataract and retinitis pigmentosa. According to this embodiment, alleviating a visual discomfort is a therapeutic action and means treating a symptom of a disease, wherein the term "treating" also encompass a preventive action. As used herein, the term "Vigilance" term encompasses one or more of the following traits: wakefulness, alertness, attentiveness, concentration and focus. Accordingly, the WO 2012/013792 CA 02806009 2013-01-18 PCT/EP2011/063130 term "hypovigilance" refers to a deficit in one or more traits of vigilance. The state of hypovigilance may also represent an intermediate state between waking and sleeping. As used herein, an "agent for enhancing vigilance" enhances one's ability to increase and/or maintain concentration, along with the ability to ignore surrounding signals not of relevance to the situation. In one embodiment of the invention, an agent for enhancing vigilance increases beta-1 brainwaves. Beta waves are associated with mental activity, alertness, problem solving, judgment, decision making and processing information, ail components of "vigilance". According to this embodiment, vigilance may be assessed by methods including, but not limited to, neuron-imaging techniques, such as, for example, Electro Encephalograms and Event Related Potentials, as described in WO20101094761, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Trypsin and collagenase are from Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, New Jersey Method Diets The Sprague Dawley rat (10 Males) used extensively in medical research weighing 450-520g were received and placed separately in cage in room temperature controlled (22°C). This rat species is chose for its calmness and its easy handling. Rats were maintained in dark periode condition and fed a diet (755 g/kg wheat starch, 150 g/kg casein, 50 g/kg peanut oil, 35 g/kg AIN-93M mineral mixture, 10 g/kg AIN-76A vitamin mixture) during 2 weeks (Felgines, C. et al. J. Nutr 2002). Anthocyanin stability and detection As anthocyanins are particularly susceptible to pli variations and are unstable at intestinal pli, collected samples were analyzed by HPLC after acidification with 240 mmol/L HC1, to allow the comparison with intestinal administration. Plasmatic anthocyanins levels were assessed after plasma separation of blood samples by centrifugation and extracted with a solid-phase extraction cartridge (Sep-Pak C18 Plus) and then analyzed by HPLC possessing a photodiode array detector and an UV-visible detector (785A, Perkin-Elmer) at 524 nm. Spectrum was compared to Cyanidin 3glucoside that represent 98% of total anthocyanins. Anthocyanin metabolite analysis was carried out by HPLC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS-MS analysis and performed on a HPLC system equipped with MS-MS detection (API 2000). Anthocyanin metabolites were detected according to the respective m/z values of their parent and product ions. WO 2012/013792 CA 02806009 2013-01-18 PCT/EP2011/063130 Absorption from mucosal epithelium and serum was estimated by calculating the difference between anthocyanin quantity contained in buccal gum patch administered and the amount recovered at the end in samples. Buccal administration process Rats (OFA, Sprague-Dawlay) received a lingual administration of anthocyanins with an orodispersible gum containing 1.25 mg of anthocyanin. The stick gum was deposited at the buccal mucosa area. Peripheral blood was collected 1 hour post-administration, centrifuged and plasma was acidified through formic acid addition. After acidification, plasma samples were conserved at -80°C and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometer/Mass Spectrometer). In parallel, epithelium and conjunctive tissues were collected 45 minutes postadministration, placed in formic acid and eventually conserved at -80°C. Before LCMS/MS analyze, tissues were washed in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) and homogenized on ice. Protein concentrations were determined by Lowry method. To facilitate tissues preparation, samples were homogenized and treated with 2.5% trypsin and 2% collagenase during 1.5h at 37°C, and then acidified with formic acid. Treatment with formic acid does not affect anthocyanins stability. Absorption was estimated by calculating the administering/recovering anthocyanosides estimated concentration in samples ratio. Quantification was adjusted in respect of residual anthocyanoside quantity contained in buccal washing (anthocyanosides extracted from stick gum not absorbed and residual non dissolved stick gum). Digestive administration process Digestive administration of anthocyanosides is done as previously Talavera, C Felgines, O Texier et al. J. Nutr. 134: 2275-2279, 2004). described (S Briefly, samples were collected at the beginning and after perfusion period (45 min), and anthocyanins were analyzed by HPLC as previously described. Intestinal perfusion method (Crespy, V., Morand, C., Manach, C., et al. Am. J. Physiol. 277:G120 -G126, 1999) is done using bile duct annulation consist in jejunal plus intestine ileal segment (flexura duodenojejunalis to the valvula ileocecalis) perfusion. This segment was WO 2012/013792 CA 02806009 2013-01-18 PCT/EP2011/063130 perfused for 45 min at a flow rate of 0.75 mL/min with a physiological buffer containing KH2 PO4 (5 mmol/L), K2 HPO4 (2.5 mmol/L), NaHCO3 (5 mmol/L), NaC1 (50 mmol/L), KC1 (40 mmol/L), CaC12 (2 mmol/L), MgSO4 (1 mmol/L), tri-potassium citrate (10 mmol/L), glucose (12 mmol/L), glutamine (2 mmol/L), and taurocholic acid (1 mmol/L), pli 6.6, at 37°C supplemented with blackberry extract containing 25% and 50%, respectively. Absorption was estimated by calculating the administrating/recovering anthocyanins ratio. Extract containing 25% of Anthocyanins is purchased from Naturex SA (Avignon, France). Extract containing 50% of Anthocyanins is purchased from Ferlux Mediolanum SA (Cournon d'Auvergne, France). Anthocyanosides concentration is based on Delphinidine (C sHHC107 , PM = 338,70g.mol- ).

Anthocyanins are significantly absorbed in the tissues and in the plasma. Moreover, the absorption of anthocyanin is more effective when the administration is done through the lingual way, as compared to the digestive way. Indeed, as shown on figure 1, the calculated absorption of anthocyanin is more than fold superior when the vegetal extract containing anthocyanin is administered by the lingual route (compare "Anthocyanin-25 (buccal)" and "Anthocyanin-25 (digestive)"). WO 2012/013792 CA 02806009 2013-01-18 PCT/EP2011/063130 Moreover, the lingual route of administration allows the administration of an amount of anthocyanin lower than with a digestive route, for the same biological result. Indeed, as shown in figure 1, the amount of absorbed anthocyanin is greater when a vegetal extract containing anthocyanin titrated at 25% of anthocyanin is administered by a lingual route than when an extract titrated at 50% is administered by a digestive route (compare "Anthocyanin-25 (buccal)" and "Anthocyanin-50 (digestive)"). Example Experimental procedure: Rats received a fed diet or gum containing Taurine (50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg), Lutein (6 mg/kg and 12 mg/kg), and Anthocyanine (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg) to follow digestive versus sublingual absorption of these compounds, then blood sample are harvested 1 hour after administration.

The efficacy of the composition of the invention on visual function, vigilance and reaction time were assessed in subjects receiving one chewing gum of the invention. Method subjects (age ranging from 18 to 65) have received one chewing gum of the invention, or one chewing gum without active ingredient (control). Visual function assessment Visual function was assessed by visual acuity measurement (ETDRS acuity testing), field of vision measurement, sensibility to contrast and glare measurement, and perception of visual fatigue by the subject. For evaluating visual fatigue, the subject evaluated the frequency/duration of the symptoms of eye fatigue by giving a notation from 0 (absence) to 10 (continuous presence). Examined symptoms of eye fatigue were itching, pain, winking and enhanced tear production. Vigilance assessment Vigilance was assessed using a questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised six questions, related to the perception of the subject regarding its capacity of concentration, its general fatigue, its wakefulness, its alertness, its attentiveness, and its focus. For each question, the subject has to give a notation from 0 (very poor) to (very high). Reaction time assessment For assessing the reaction time of a subject, the following test was carried out: the subject presses the space bar every time an asterisk appears on the computer screen (the interval between appearances is random). The response time corresponds to the interval between the appearance of the asterisk and the action to press the space bar. Result Reported returns were positive in the three categories: lower eye fatigue associated with lower tear production and winking ; lower perception of general fatigue and personal assessment, better perception of attentiveness and alertness. Reaction time assessment was also improved.
