This invention relates to a new material or substance having certain desirable magnetic qualities, among which are high magnetic permeability, especially at low magnetising forces, and low hysteresis l It is on object of this invention to provide a suitable loading materiaI for signalling conduc- rs to increase their range and speed of operation. This and other objects will become apparent on consideration of examples of practice tberonnder which will be discIosed specifically in this specification, with the understanding that the definition of the invention will be given in the appended claims. The importance of iron in the practical application of electricity is well known and has often been remarked upon. Its unique quality of high magnetic permeability has made it indispensable for the cores of tractive electromagnets for dynamos, motors, teIephone receivers, telegraph relays, etc. For this purpose it may, in certain cases, be advantageously united" with a very small proportion of some other element for example silicon. With this quailfication it may truly be said that the high permeability of iron nukes it practically the only medium to be considered for the translation of energy of the electric c rront into useful mechanical effect, and for the reciprocal translation of mechanical energy into electric current. In dynamo electric machines it is common to have laminated from cores subject to resultant magnetislng forces of the order of 2 to 5 or more C. G. S. units and to develop magnetic flaxes in these iron ceres of the order of 10,000 to 20,000 lines per square centimeter of cross-section. Much attention has been given to obtaining a quality of iron of high permeability for magnetising forces and flux densities of the orders here mentioned. On this quality of iron depends its eflectivoness in most electromagnets. Silicon steel exhibits magnetic qualities superior to ordinary iron in som respects, but its empioynLent is limited by its comparative brittleness and the diifieulty of working it. A good cluality of soft iron has been commonly employed as the best magnetic medium for general use for tractice electromagnets. The princiF tl possible rivals of iron, nickel and cobalt, are far below it in permeabilit, at the magnetising forces involved in such apparatus. With nickel and cobalt in this respect, stands Heusler's alloy of aluminium, [Reprinted. ] manganese, and copper. It will be seen that with the exception of alumini m, all these metals stand close together in their automatic weights alid automatic numbers and in this specification the t ve elements, manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt and copper, having the consecutive at,3mic numbers 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 will be referred to as belonging to the magnetic group of elements. The criterion of high permeability is not the only one to be considered in seeking the best magnetic material. If the maguetising forces and the resultant flux are changed rapidly, then for most purposes the material should exhibit a low hysteresis loss. The development of eddy currents under these conditions may be obviated to a considerable extent by lamination, but the resistivity of the material is a factor that may be of importance in this connection; the higher the resistivity, the more the eddycurrent loss will be kept down. Magnetic material has important uses aside from its use in tractive electromagnets An obvious example is for the cores of alternating current transformers. In many situations it is desirable go increase the inductive reactance of an electric conductor and for this purpose magnetic material placed in the field of magnetic force associated with the eondncter. This the principle of choke coils, and of the loading coils which are employed on telephone transmission lines. Since Heaviside discussed the question about 1890, it has been well undue stood that an ideal way to improve signalling conductors wonld be by continuous loading, that is, by enveloping the conductor with a layer of magnetic material throughout its length. One trouble has been that with the low magnetising forces fonnd in signalling conductors, and the low permeability of known magnetic materials at these forces, the induztlon in the loading layer was too slight to be useful for long telegraph cables. Generally speaking, was fonnd that better resnlts in transmission would be secured by devoting the available cross-section entirely to copper instead of part to copper with the remainder an iron layer. Accordingly, to the present time although there have been many suggestions for continuous loading, it has been found of no'adyantage for any purpose except for a few comparatively short, snhmarine telephone transmission lines, in a few instances of this class, continuous loading with iron has been employed advantageously. It has not been made useful hitherto in telegraphy. This invention provides a new magnetic material comprising elements of the magnetic group combined in suitable proportions, which, when sub jeered a proper heat treatment and guarded against undue stresses and other disturbing causes develops and retains an extremely high pCt leabllity at low magnetising forces, and a low hysteresis loss. This material has furthermore been applied with advantage to the continuous loading of signalling conductors in such a manner as to obtain the full benefits cf the above noted desirable proportions. In order to illustrate the method which is employed in heat treating this material, a short description will be given of the method which is used when the material is employed as a loading material for transmission lines, it is be understood that the method disclosed is merely illustrative and is parti,- cularly described as it is a method which has been carried out in actual practice, Iron and nickel re fused together in an indnetion furnace in the pro portion of about 21½ per cent. of iron and 78½ per cent. of nickel. Good commercial grades of these two metals are suitable for this purpose. The molten composition is poured in a mold and cooled to fo T a thick bar or rod. This subjected to repeated swaging operation by which it is reduced in diameter and correspondingly elongated. The long rod thus formed is then drawn out by repeated wire drawing operations to a size of about No. 20 B and gan oe. This wire is then passed between flattening mils, and y several such operations, it is flattened to a tape of the thickness of about inch and width a little more than 0'125 inch. This tape is passed through rolls or discs which trim its edges squarely on both sides and give the tape an exact and uniform width. This tape of nickel-iron composition now ready for application upon a conductor. The tape which has been thus prepared is now wrapped about a copper wire, care being taken to abut the edges closely without lapping. The taped conductor is then drawn lengthwise through a furnace which is maintained at, about a temperature of 875 e Centigrade, the length of the pass through the fnrnace to be about two feet and the rate of movement of the conductor therethrengh abont a ft. per second. As the magnetic material emerges into the air from the furnace it is quickly cooled to about 20° Centigrade, which is abont the normal room temperature. For the speed of mox, ing the material through the furnace as described, .... a proper rate of coohng Is obta 1 ed. ( a 1 'e should be taken not to bend the material until it is well cooled, in order that the high permeability which has been developed in it will not be decreased. To develop the utmost possible permeability according to this invention, the rate of coolihg after the heating in the furnace is a matter of considerable importance. For the signalling conductor above described, the utmost possit e permeability is not particldarly desirable, and an effective permeability of 2,400 which is sufficient for the purpose, will he developed by cooling in air as the taped conductor emerges from tile furnace. or some cases of which an example will be described later, a more exact procedure with respect to the rate of cooling is contemplated. While 78½ per cent. and 21 per cent. have been mentioned as giving the proportion of the ingredients, nickel and iron, to be employed in making up tile improved magnetic material, it will be understood that tbe proportion may deviate considerable from these figures when nickel and iron are the only ingredients, and that wizen there al other ingredients, this proportion m@ not apply. Up to the present time, when the (rely ingredients are nickel and iron, it has been found that a portion about the same as that named, gives the greatest permeability for low magnetising forces. Other ingredients than nickel and ron may be employed for various purposes, not onl) to confer high permeability on the product but for other objects; for examf!e, it may be desirable to add chromium for the reason that a comparatively small quantity of this element will cause a decided increase in he resistivity of the composition, and this high resistivity may be a desirable factor to cut down the'eddy current losses in the material. A composition of nickel 55 per cent., iron 34 per cent. and chromium 11 per cent. has been carefully prepared, beattreated, and tested, and has been found to give a high value of permeability at low magnetising forces. ' When this material was tested in the form of pancake coils hereinafter described, the permeability o the composition at very low magnetising forces was 1001) or more, which is much higher than the figure for iron. A superior silicon steel gives a permeability at forces approaching zero of only about 490. Thus it will be seen that with the addition of chromium in considerable quantity, the composition still has a decidedly higher permeal:ilitv than iron, though perhaps somewhat less than might be attained if the chromium were not present. The resistivity of the col )pceition eontainin,,, chromium, j,,st referred tb, is 100 microhms per cubic centimeter, whereas the resistivity of iron is only about 11 microhms per cubic centimeter, and the resistivity of the composition of nickel 784i per cent. and iron 21 per +eat. is about 17 m'icrohms per cubic centinleter. Measurements of the permeability cf nickel-iron compositions of other proportions than that here stated have sl,own that the dellartnro may be considerable without serious impairment of the permeability. Thus, using pancake coils for 70 per cent. nickel instead'of 78½ per cent after proper annealing and cooling, he permeability at forces approaching zero. is about 1.400, and at a magnetising force of 0'2 C G. S. unit the permeability is about 15,000 wbereas for a percentage of 78½ the respective values of permeability are 7000 and 88.500. It will be seen that these values are much higher than for silicon steel at the same magnetising forces which has respective permeahilities of only about 400 and 1500. Thus a wide departure may be made from the proportion named, yet, the permeability at low magnetising forces will be far greater than for the best materials of the prior art. It has already been mentioned that after the proper heat treatment the composition should be guarded against undue stresses and strains. When the percentages are nickel 78½ and iron 21½, the material can be bent with less impairment of permeability than whe the percentages are respectively a:nd 30. I9 other words, the optimum percentage seems to be more rugged against xmpalrment of permeability by stresscs and strains than the other percentage. :However, the difference is not marked and apparently, if the material can be guarded against stresses and strains, this difference is of no great coneeqnenee. The maximum attainable permeability for the nickel-iron composition at percentages of 78½ a nd 21½ respectively for the nickel and iron has been between 6,000 and 9,606 for zero magnetising forces. This value is obtained by determining a series of vaince for exceedingly low forces, say of the oMer of 6"01 to 0.5 C. G. S. units. The results plot linearly and may be extrapolated back to the value for n =0, and thus giving the value of the permeability t zero magnetising force. The maximum permeability so far attained between 45,060 and 66,666. This occurs with the 784 per cent. nickel composition at a magnetizing force of about 0-1 C. G. S. units, and the corresponding value of the induction B being from 4,500 to 5,000 C. G. S. units. The qualities of the new magnetic material exemplified by the nickel-iron composition are evidently not obtained by taking the mere sum or average of the qualities of its components. Not only is the permeability at low forces much greater than for either ingredient (nickel or iron) alone, but the ingredient (nickel) having the lower permeability alone is the major constituent of the composition, while iron, which alone is the best magnetic material previously known, here enters into the composition only to the extent of less than a fourth part. Evidently a smaller proportion of nickel gives a decidedly higher reeitivity and it may be desirable in certain eases to sacrifice permeability for the sake of resistivity. Mention has already been made that for some purposes the utmost attainment of permeability is not necessary, and in such cases it may be bettor to decrease the proportion of nickel. At 781 per cent. nickel, the hysteresis value is as low as 160 errs. It will be noted that this percentage for minilnum hysteresis loss is the same as for maximum permeability. The low result for the nickel-iron composition at this percentage will be seen to be much lower than the values for other magnetic materials. Thus for a superior quality of iron, the value is as high as 925 and for nickel it is no less than 2,200. The mere intimate union of the ingredients of the new magnetic material may not be sufficient to cause it to exhibit the useful property of high permeability at low magnetising forces to the degree mentioned. Proper heat treatment may be necessary to attain that degree of permeability. In general, so far as investigations have gone, it has been found preferable to heat the described nickel-iron composition at least as hot as 82 ° C and then cool it down at the proper rate, not too fast but fast enough. This proper rate of cooling is attained in the example described specifically, b a rather ordinary procedure of cooling in air. The foregoing discussion of the matter of the heat treatment affords guidance by its detailed presentation of a sFgoeifio example, but it may be helpful to go over the matter for a different example. Assume that one has obtained a composition of the desired ingredient in the desired percentage relation, but that he does not know what its previous history has been with respect to heat treatment, and tha he wishes to develop the utmost permeability for low forces. It has been found convenient for testing purposes to take lengths of something like 40 feet of tape of crosssection 0.125 inch by 0.006 inch and wind these lengths into pancake coils about three inches in outside diameter with a layer of paper between the successive turns. The paper may then be expelled with an air blast, thus assuring that the turns of the metal tape are sufficiently loose to guard against undue stresses and strains therein. These aneakB coils are ovide.atly conveniently available for testing for permeabtlity by the well:known method involving the use of a ballistic galvanometer. The first step will be to heat a series of specimens cf this composition to a temperature around 900 degrees centigrade and hold them there for a long enough time to be assured that they have attained this nniform temperature throughout. There wilt be no objection to heating the specimens somewhat hotter and it may be easier in this way to become assured that the temperature is sufficiently high throughout. The improved magnetic material here under discussion has a so-called ." critical temperature " or " magnetic transition temperature " for low magnetizing forces, like iron and other magnetic materials. That is, when heated from normal temperature to higher andhigher temperatures, its permsability increases to a peak and then falls o i and vanishes very abruptly and the temperatnre where this last change takes place is the so-called "critical tsmperatnre " (page 116 of the 1900 edition of Ewing's Magnetic Induction in iron and other metals). This magnetic transition temperature for the improved magnetic matsrial of this invention will be considerably below the temperature of 900 degrees that has just been mentioned in a preceding paragraph, and it will be different for different compositions, and when the ingredients are nickel and iron it will be different for different proportions of the ingredients. Generally speaking, this magnetic transition temperature will lie around 500 degrees C. or 600 degrees C. and may be somewhat more or less than these figures. Having heated the specimens thoroughly to a t cmperatore of at least 900 degrees C., they are next cooled down to a temperature near this magnetic transition temperature, preferably a temporal re a little higher than the magnetic transition temperature. For a composition of nickel and iro only, with from 55 per cent. nickel to 80 per cent. :c' .el, this critical tenpin-r tere will lie between 550 degrees C. and 625 dcgrees C. The rate for cooling from 900 degrees C. down to this point should be eou viently gradual, say twenty minutes may be required for this stage with a I aneake coil of loosely wc.nnd nickel-iron tape as heretofore described. No lJ.u,m can be done by cooling too slowly through this stage from 900 degrees d wn. Next the sl?eoi lens are to be cooled down through a temperature zone that will carry them distinctly lower than thc magnetic transition temperature at a rate which is desired to be fast enollgh and yet not too fast. They should not be cooled so rapidly as to set up undue stresses and strains, for if this is done the permeabthty 211 be less than the utmost atta 2 able. On the other hand they should not be cooled too slowly, that is they should be cooled fast enough so that at normal temperatures they will exhibit the highest permeability that can be developed therein. Assuming as heretofore suggested, that the test is being made with a whole series of like specimens treated alike to the point of cooling down to the magnetic transition temperature, these specimens may be cooled at ilifferent rates from that point down to say about 300 degrees, then cooled at any convenient rate the rest of the way down to normal temperature, and then tested to see which of them has had the highest permeability developed therein. The results obtained will be reproducible, so that in this way the optimum rate of cooling in the stage from the critical temperature down, may be accurately determined. To sum up briefly, the specimen should he cooled through the stage front he critical temperature down at a rate not too fast and yet fast enough to develop the highest permeability at normal temperatures with low magnetieing forces. This rate may be readily determined by testing a series of specimens at different rates. In comaection with the foregoing, it should be remembered, (l) that for many purposes tbe utmost permeability is not necessary nor desirable; (2) that the rate of cooling that gives the utmost permeability is not exactly d narrowly determined, but that other rates of cooling not widely different will give almost or quite as great permeability; (3) that a little practice will enable one very quickly to recegnise the best procedure, and (4) that if it is m)t convenient to carry a plurality of test samples through different rates of cooling, a single sample can be taken over the same temperature range in successive trials at the different rates• In this connection it will be noticed th: 1 when the optimum rate has been discovered, the reproducibility of the proeedure enables the maximum permeability to be re-established in the same ample or a like sample. 813s It may be important to protect the magnetic material from stresses after it has had its high permeability developed by the proper procedure of annealing and cooling. Phus, in the case of the loaded cable, it has been found that if an attempt is made to put the tape through an annealing and cooling treatment and thereafter apply it to the conductive copper core, the permeability may be impaired. Apparently, he stresses involved in winding the tape upon the conductive core have a tendency to destroy the permeability that has previously been conferred upon the material of the tape. Hence it has been found advisable to conduct the heat treatment after the magnetic material has been assembled in its operative relation to the electric conductor with which it is to be associated. For the continuous loading of a signalling conductor it is important not only to secure high permeability of the loa.ding material, hut it is important that the permeability be uniform. It has required much investigation to determine the necessary conditions of treatment, and these conditions have been presented in this specification. The improved nlagnetic material of this invention may be used advantageously for relay armatnres and frequency changers and modulators. It is also useful for lumped loading as well as for continuous loading. Choke coils of very high inductsnce and low resistance, may be made up in remarkably small volume, with consequent saving of material and low cost of manufacture. Coils with cores of this material have been found particularly valuable for use as magnetic shunts in submarine came telegraph receiving apparatns. This materm] is also goad for transformer ceres, especially those working at low magnetising forces, such as input transformers for telephone repeaters, We claim : 1.
