VIAL ADAPTER FOR SIDE ENGAGEMENT OF VIAL CAP Cross-references to Related Applications [0001] Not applicable. BACKGROUND Field [0002] The present disclosure generally relates to vials, and, in particular, to vial adapters. Description of the Related Art [0003] Medications and similarly dispensed substances are typically stored in a vial that is sealed with a vial cap having an access port for injecting fluid into the vial (e.g., adding a diluent for reconstitution of the medication therein) or removing fluid from the vial. A closure of the vial usually includes a pierceable rubber stopper formed of an elastomeric material such as butyl rubber or the like. The vial cap, typically formed of metal, is crimped over the pierceable rubber stopper and a flange of the vial to hold the stopper in place in the opening of the vial. The vial cap has an opening, or access port, through which the stopper and the vial opening may be accessed. A sharp cannula, such as a needle, is inserted into the access port of the vial cap piercing the rubber stopper to position the piercing end of the sharp cannula past the rubber stopper within the interior area of the vial. The piercing end of the sharp cannula includes an opening to make fluid connection with the contents of the vial. [0004] In some arrangements, a vial adapter can include a needleless connection device whereby a piercing end is inserted into the access port of a vial cap to make fluid connection with the contents of a vial. Due, at least in part, to concern regarding the possibility of the transmission of blood-borne diseases through accidental needle punctures of patients and health care personnel, needleless connection devices are used with increasing frequency to reduce the risk of inadvertent punctures. Vial adapters incorporating needleless connection devices for fluid connection with vials typically have piercing ends less sharp than sharp cannulae. The piercing end of such vial adapters are generally larger than that of a sharp cannula, and have one or more openings to make fluid connection with the contents of the vial. SUMMARY [0005] In certain embodiments, a vial adapter is disclosed that comprises a needleless connector having a housing and defining one or more fluid pathways therein; an elongated piercing spike operatively coupled to the needleless connector, the elongated piercing spike having a longitudinal axis and one or more channels for fluid connectivity with the one or more fluid pathways; at least one housing arm coupled to the housing and extending parallel to the longitudinal axis; and a coupling member configured to orthogonally receive a vial cap with respect to the longitudinal axis, the coupling member having a planar surface, an aperture of the planar surface longitudinally aligned with the elongated piercing spike, and at least one support arm extending from the planar surface operatively coupled with the at least one housing arm to allow relative longitudinal movement between the coupling member and the elongated piercing spike. [0006] In certain embodiments, an apparatus for adapting a vial is disclosed that comprises receiving tracks configured to orthogonally receive a vial cap into an opening between the receiving tracks; a housing having a fluid pathway connected to a piercing element that extends along a longitudinal axis; and a longitudinal movement arrangement coupled between the housing and the receiving tracks to allow controllable movement of the housing and the piercing element along the longitudinal axis with respect to the receiving tracks. [0007] In certain embodiments, an apparatus for coupling a connector having a piercing element to a vial is disclosed that comprises receiving tracks configured to orthogonally receive a vial cap into an opening between the receiving tracks; a housing configured to receive the connector; and a longitudinal movement arrangement coupled between the housing and the receiving tracks to allow controllable movement of the housing along a longitudinal axis with respect to the receiving tracks. [0008] In certain embodiments, a method for establishing fluid connectivity with a vial is disclosed that comprises orthogonally receiving a vial cap of the vial into an opening between receiving tracks such that a piercing element of a connector is disposed above the vial cap; longitudinally moving the connector to insert the piercing element through the vial cap.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0019] The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology. Like components are labeled with identical element or sub-element numbers for ease of understanding. Reference numbers may have letter suffixes appended to indicate separate instances of a common element while being referred to generically by the same number without a suffix letter. [0020] While the following description is directed to the administration of medical fluid to a patient by a medical practitioner using the disclosed vial adapters, it is to be understood that this description is only an example of usage and does not limit the scope of the claims. Various aspects of the disclosed vial adapters may be used in any application where it is desirable to secure a container, as well as guide and precisely position a piercing member within the container. [0021] The disclosed vial adapter overcomes several challenges discovered with respect to certain conventional vial adapters. One challenge with certain vial adapters is achieving the proper balance of force and leverage required to couple a vial adapter to a vial. For example, with smaller vials, there may be little surface area on the vial bottom with which to properly balance the vial such that a spike can be inserted into its small access port without slipping and causing damage to the vial or injury to the medical practitioner. Moreover, a deep rubber stopper may be used, for instance, when the medication therein is hazardous and/or particularly susceptible to contamination with air. While a sharp, generally thin needle will easily puncture such a deep rubber stopper in a small vial, a spike or piercing end of a needleless connection device may be challenged to do so. Another challenge with certain vial adapters is that they provide very imprecise means to position a spike within the interior of the vial past the rubber stopper. When the contents of the vial are extremely expensive, for example, chemotherapy medications, the precise positioning of the spike is important to retrieving all of the vial’s valuable contents. In some instances, once a spike extends a distance into the vial, it cannot be retracted either for safety precautions or otherwise. [0022] Therefore, in accordance with the present disclosure, it is advantageous to provide a vial adapter as described herein that first secures the vial, then is configured to guide the spike to effectively pierce the rubber stopper of the vial. Additionally, it is advantageous to provide a vial adapter as described herein that provides for controlled, minute increments of the spike into the vial such that a fluid channel aperture may be precisely placed in the interior of a vial to maximize the amount of medication that is extracted therefrom. [0023] FIG. 1Α. shows a vial adapter 100 comprising a needleless connector 110, an elongated piercing spike 130, and a coupling member 140, in accordance with certain embodiments. The needleless connector 1 10 has a port 111 and a housing 112 for enclosing the various components therein utilized for providing a needleless connection. It is understood that embodiments of the vial adapter 100 are not limited by the type of needleless connection technology utilized. Thus, various types of needleless connectors 110 for controlling fluid flow can be used. [0024] The elongated piercing spike 130 is operatively coupled to the needleless connector 110 and has a longitudinal axis 101. In accordance with certain embodiments, the elongated piercing spike 130 may be fixably connected to or fabricated integral with the needleless connector 110. In operation, the elongated piercing spike 130 and needleless connector 110 will longitudinally move along the longitudinal axis 101. However, it is understood that the needleless connector 110 need not be aligned with the elongated piercing spike 130. For example, in some embodiments, the needleless connector 110, or a portion thereof, may be angled in a manner to promote ease of access to the port 111 of the needleless connector 110 for use in certain staging or vial arrangements. [0025] Housing anus 120a, 120b are coupled to the housing 112 of the needleless connector 110 in any suitable fashion and extend parallel to the longitudinal axis 101 for engagement with the coupling member 140. The coupling member 140 has a planar surface 152 and support arms 142a, 142b extending from the planar surface. The support arms 142a, 142b are operatively coupled with corresponding housing arms 120a, 120b to promote longitudinal movement between the coupling member 140 and the elongated piercing spike 130. Housing arms 120a, 120b include tubular portions 124a, 124b for receiving the support arms 142a, 142b of the coupling member 140. In this regard, a more rigid and sturdy interconnection between the coupling member 140 and needleless connector 110 and elongated piercing spike 130 results. [0026] Referring to FIG. IB, an enlarged cross-sectional view of housing arm 120b and support arm 142b shows the manner of engagement therebetween in accordance with certain embodiments. Housing arm 120b includes one or more detents 122 and support arm 120b includes a plurality of notches 144a, 144b, 144c. The one or more detents 122 engage with the plurality of notches 144 to provide fixable or lockable longitudinal movement along the longitudinal axis 101. The one or more detents 122 can be made to disengage with or release from notch 144b by applying a downward force to the housing arms 120a, 120b and/or the needleless connector 110, for example. Moreover, the plurality of notches 144 (and corresponding one or more detents 122 if more than one detent 122 is utilized) may be spaced at defined increments to promote a controlled fixable longitudinal movement. In some embodiments, the distance between adjacent notches 144 may be equal. However, in other embodiments, the distance between adjacent notches 144 may be larger at an expected position when the elongated piercing spike 130 pierces the vial 190, whereas the distance between adjacent notches 144 may be smaller at an expected position when the elongated piercing spike 130 has already pierced the vial 190. [0027] In this regard, the elongated piercing spike 130 is fixably or selectively lockably movable along the longitudinal axis 101 such that small incremental longitudinal movements can be made to guide the elongated piercing spike 130 and precisely obtain a desired depth of it into the vial 190, and, therefore, avoid forcing the elongated piercing spike 130 past such a desired depth. [0028] It is to be appreciated that other means are contemplated and may be employed to facilitate longitudinal interconnection, and fixable longitudinal movement between the coupling member 140 and elongated piercing spike 130. For example, the housing arms 120a, 120b may be replaced by a cylinder with internal projections that interact with notches 144. [0029] In other embodiments, a cylinder can be provided with internal threads and interact with threads that replace the notches 144. [0030] An example of a vial 190 is also show in FIG. 1Α. The vial may be a standard-sized vial 190 containing medications and similarly dispensed substances therein. The vial 190 has a vial cap 191 that includes an access port 195 on atop surface and a circumferential edge 192, a vial neck 193, and a flat vial bottom 195 for stabilization when inserting a medical implement, such as a sharp cannula or spike into the interior of the vial 190. [0031] The coupling member 140 includes a side opening and is configured in a manner such that it may orthogonally receive 102 the vial cap 191 of the vial 190 with respect to the longitudinal axis 101 of the elongated piercing spike 130. In operation, a vial center longitudinal axis 199 is aligned with the longitudinal axis 101 of the elongated piercing spike 130 such that the elongated piercing spike 130 will pierce the rubber stopper or like membrane of the access port 195 similarly aligned proximal to the vial center longitudinal axis 199. [0032] FIG. 2 depicts the vial adapter 100 coupled to the vial 190 from a side view (i.e., FIG. 1Α rotated 90 degrees clockwise along the longitudinal axis 101 and looking into the side opening 145 with the vial cap 191 therein). In certain embodiments, the housing arms 120a, 120b include bridge portion 126 that connects housing arms 120a, 120b to the housing 112. In some embodiments, the bridge portion 126 is permanently affixed to or integral with the housing 1 12. However, in other embodiments, the bridge portion 126 may be securely, but removably attached to the housing 112 of the needleless connector 110 so that the housing arms 120a, 120b and bridge portion 126, as well as the coupling member 140 can be reused with another needleless connector 110 and vial 190. [0033] Although housing arms 120a, 120b and corresponding or mating support arms 142a, 142b for guiding the elongated piercing spike 130 are shown in the embodiments of FIGS 1Α, IB, and 2, it is to be appreciated that a single housing arm 120 may be used in some embodiments, and more than two housing arms 120 may be used in other embodiments. [0034] In operation, an axial force 103 is applied (generally downward with the vial bottom 197 on a flat surface) to the housing arms 120a, 120b and/or the needleless connector 110 such that the elongated piercing spike 130 (behind housing arm 120b and support arm 142b in the view of FIG. 2) pierces the access port 195 of the vial cap 191 and extends into the vial 190. [0035] With reference to FIGS. 3Α and 3Β, a top plan view (FIG. 3Α) and a bottom plan view (FIG. 3Β) of coupling member 140 according to certain embodiments is shown. The coupling member 140 comprises a first receiving channel 141, which includes a side opening 145 for receiving the vial cap 190 of a vial (shown already received in the first receiving channel 141). The first receiving channel 141 further includes atop portion 150 defined by a planar surface 152 and an aperture 154 of the planar surface 152, a bottom portion 160, and an arcuate side wall 156 connecting the top portion 150 and the bottom portion 160. The bottom portion 160 is configured to extend proximal to the vial neck 193. The rim 192 or edge around the vial cap 191 is shown with respect to an inner surface 162 of the arcuate side wall 156. The aperture 154 of the planar surface 152 is longitudinally aligned with the elongated piercing spike 130 (not shown), and sized to receive the access port 195 disposed on the vial cap 191. [0036] In some embodiments, the inner surface 162 may include a rubber film or similar gripping layer to aid in securing the vial cap 191 within the first receiving channel 141. [0037] In some embodiments, the first receiving channel 141 is configured to receive and secure a predetermined vial cap size. For example, predetermined vial cap sizes for which the first receiving channel 141 may be configured to receive include 13 mm, 20 mm, 28 mm, and 32 mm standard-sized vial caps and corresponding vials. Moreover, in certain embodiments, a cross sectional length (Dl) of the arcuate side wall defining the side opening 145 is less than the diameter (D2) of the predetermined vial cap size. In this regard, the vial cap 191 will snap into the first receiving channel 141 and be secured therein. [0038] An orientation of the support arms 142 in accordance with some embodiments is shown in top plan view of FIG. 3Α. Support arms 142a, 142b longitudinally extend from the planar surface 152 and are aligned with the side opening 145 in certain embodiments to minimize or avoid displacement when the vial cap 191 enters or is removed from the first receiving channel 141. Alternatively, or in addition to, support arms 142c, 142d may similarly extend from the planar surface 152. For example, support arms 142c, 142d, in conjunction with corresponding housing arms 120 (not shown) may provide additional support and structure for a needleless connector such as embodiments utilizing a plurality of different-sided receiving channels (to be described latter with respect to FIG. 5) that require longer elongated piercing spikes 130 to traverse the receiving channels. In some embodiments, the housing arms 120 may be replaced by one or more annular arms 120℮, 120f, 120g, 120h to form a partial or complete cylinder having internal projections that interact with notches 144. [0039] FIG. 4 shows a partial longitudinal cross-sectional view of the vial adapter 100 in which the coupling member 140 is attached to the vial cap 191 and the elongated piercing spike 130 is inserted through the access port 145 and the rubber stopper 182 of the vial 190. As shown, the vial 190 and vial adapter 100 are inverted from an upright position that would be used to first pierce the vial 190 (see FIG. 2). Thus, medication 184 may be drawn from the vial 190 and air 186 may be added to the vial 190 to maintain a neutral or equalized pressure within the vial 190. [0040] In certain embodiments, one or more channels 133a, 133b of the elongated piercing spike 130 establish fluid connectivity with one or more fluid pathways 114a, 114b of the needleless connector 110. For example, medication 184 may flow through medication fluid channel 133a and medication fluid pathway 114a to the port 111 (not shown) or proximal to the port from a medical implement, whereas air 186 may flow from the port 111 (not shown) or proximal to the port from the medical implement (or a different port in some embodiments) through the air pathway 114b and air channel 133b into the vial 190. Moreover, in some implementations, an air aperture 132b of the air channel 133b is disposed on the elongated piercing spike 130 proximal to a pointed end 131 and a fluid aperture 132a of the medication fluid channel 133a is disposed distal to the pointed end 131. [0041] Therefore, by precisely positioning the fluid aperture 132a adjacent to an interior facing side of the rubber stopper 182 with the vial adapter 100, substantially all of the medication 1 84 can be extracted from the vial 194. Such complete extraction is especially beneficial when the medication 184 is chemotherapy medication or other similarly expensive and/or hazardous medications. [0042] Referring to FIGS. 5 another example of a vial adapter 200 is shown. Vial adapter 200 includes many similar elements and features (identified by like reference numbers) as the vial adapter 100 described above. However, the coupling member 240 of vial adapter 200 comprises a first receiving channel 241 having a side opening 245Α and a second receiving channel 241 having a side opening 245Β. In certain embodiments, the vial adapter 200 is arranged in a staggered configuration such that a number of receiving channels configured to receive predetermined vial cap sizes are concentrically oriented. [0043] In the staggered configuration, a smallest of the predetermined vial cap sizes of the first receiving channel (i.e., the receiving channel having the planar surface 252 included as its top portion) is a smallest predetermined vial cap size of the receiving channels. A predetermined vial cap size of a last of the additional receiving channels is a largest predetermined vial cap size of the additional receiving channels. In such a staggered configuration, a top portion of an additional receiving channel will comprise the bottom portion (see, e.g., FIG. 3Β) of the previous channel. Therefore, the coupling member 240 may comprise a total of three or five receiving channels in accordance with some embodiments. In such embodiments, the elongated piercing spike 230 (not shown) is configured to a length sufficient to extend through each successive receiving channel. [0044] Accordingly, a single vial adapter 200 can be used for differently-sized vials, such as vial 290, without compromising rigidity of and secure fitting of each receiving channel (e.g., first receiving channel 241 and second receiving channel 242) in the coupling member 240. [0045] FIG. 6 is a flow chart of an exemplary method 300 for establishing fluid connectivity with a vial 190. In certain embodiments, a vial adapter such as exemplary vial adapters 100, 200 described herein, is utilized in method 300. In operation 305, a vial cap is orthogonally received in an opening between receiving tracks or similar coupling member. When the vial cap is orthogonally received, a piercing element of a connector is disposed above the vial cap and not engaged with the vial cap of the vial contents in any way. In this regard, the vial can be staged for fluid connectivity prior to establishing fluid communications with the medication in the vial. [0046] In operation 310, the connector longitudinally moved to insert the piercing element through the vial cap. For example, a longitudinal movement arrangement is utilized to control longitudinal movement in which a user pushes down on the connector and/or portion of the longitudinal movement arrangement. Thus, the piercing element is inserted through the vial cap to pierce the septum of the vial cap. Next, in operation 315, a position of one or more apertures is adjusted within an interior of the vial. The one or more apertures are disposed along the piercing element at different locations in certain embodiments. For example, in certain embodiments, a first aperture establishes a fluid pathway for the medication in the vial and a second aperture establishes a gas pathway for maintaining proper pressurization of the interior of the vial while the vial is securely engaged with the receiving tracks or coupling member. This adjustment operation provides for fine tune adjustments of the position of the one or more apertures in accordance with some embodiments.
