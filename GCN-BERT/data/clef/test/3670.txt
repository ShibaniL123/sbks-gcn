It is known that the stereospecific (co)polymerization of conjugated dienes is an extremely important process in the chemical industry for obtaining products which are among the most widely-used rubbers. It is known, for example, that polybutadiene 1,4-cis is a synthetic elastomer whose properties are very similar to those of natural rubber. Since the beginning of stereospecific polymerization, numerous catalytic systems have been used for the production of this elastomer, as described, for example, by Porri L. et al. in: “Comprehensive Polymer Science” (1989), Eastmond G. C. et al. Eds., Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK, Vol. 4, Part II, pages 53-108. A first catalytic system capable of giving a polybutadiene having a content of 1,4-trans units ranging from 70% to 90% is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,050,513 and was based on titanium compounds containing iodine, such as, for example, titanium tetraiodide (TiI4), combined with an aluminium hydride such as, for example, lithium-aluminium hydride, sodium-aluminium hydride, potassium-aluminium hydride, rubidium-aluminium hydride, caesium-aluminium hydride. Efforts were then made in the art to find catalytic systems capable of giving polybutadiene having a high content of 1,4-cis units. Catalytic systems capable of giving a polybutadiene having a 1,4-cis content equal to about 93% are described, for example, by W. Cooper in “The Stereo Rubbers” (1977), Ed. W. M. Saltman, Wiley, New York, page (catalytic system: AliBu3-TiI4); W. Marconi et al., in “Chimica Industriale” (1963), Vol. 45, page 522 (catalytic system: AlEt3-AlEt2I—TiCl4); W. Marconi et al., in “Journal of Polymer Science” (1965), Part A, Vol. 3, page 735 (catalytic system: AlHCl2.OEt2-TiCl4—AlI3). The formation of catalytic systems characterized by a higher stereospecificity capable of giving polybutadiene having a content of 1,4-cis units equal to about 96%, is described, for example: with respect to catalytic systems comprising cobalt, in Italian patent IT 592,477 and by Gippin M. et al. in “Industrial & Engineering Chemistry, Product Research and Development” (1962), Vol. 1(1), pages 32-39; with respect to catalytic systems comprising nickel, by Ueda et. al., in “Koogyo Kagaku Zasshi” (1963), Vol. 66, page 1103, and by i et al. in “Rubber Chemistry and Technology” (1972), Vol. 45, pages 268-277. Some works relating to the use of catalytic systems comprising lanthanides for the 1,4-cis polymerization of conjugated dienes were published in the first half of the sixties′. Saltman et al. in “Rubber Chemistry and Technology” (1973), Vol. 46, page 1055 and Throckmorton et al. in “Kautschuk and Gummi Kunstoffe” (1969), Vol. 22, page 293, for example, describe the use of catalytic systems comprising cerium. These catalytic systems, however, were soon abandoned as a result of the metal residues remaining in the polymer which caused an oxidation of the polymer itself. The use of catalytic systems comprising lanthanides such as, for example, neodymium, praseodymium and gadolinium, is also known, as described, for example, by: Hsieh H. L. et al. in “Rubber Chemistry and Technology” (1985), Vol. 58(1), pages 117-145. The polybutadiene obtained using these catalytic systems has a content of 1,4-cis units of about 98%, a good processability, and a relatively broad molecular weight distribution. The use is also known of catalytic systems comprising uranium allyls capable of providing a polybutadiene having a very high content of 1,4-cis units (i.e. 99%) as described, for example, by Lugli et al. in “Die Makromoleculare Chemie” (1974), Vol. 175, Issue 7, pages 2021-2027; De Chirico A. et al. in “Die Makromoleculare Chemie” (1974), Vol. 175, Issue 7, pages 2029-2038; Bruzzone M. et al. in “Rubber Chemistry and Technology” (1974), Vol. 47, page 1175; Mazzei A. in “Die Makromoleculare Chemie” (1981), Vol. 4, Issue Supplement 3, pages 61-72. These catalytic systems, however, were also abandoned due to the presence of radioactive residues in the polymers obtained. From the above documents it emerges, however, that the use of catalytic systems comprising lanthanides offered advantages with respect to the use of catalysts based on titanium, cobalt and nickel, previously proposed and in use at that time. In particular, catalytic systems comprising lanthanides, as mentioned above, were capable of giving polymers, in particular polybutadiene, having a higher content of 1,4-cis units 97%), with a more linear structure and, consequently, more suitable for the production of tyres, which represents the most important application (about 80%) of polybutadiene 1,4-cis use. Furthermore, the above catalytic systems comprising lanthanides did not have a cationic activity and proved to have a higher activity when used in solution polymerization in the presence of aliphatic solvents rather than aromatic solvents, as described, for example, by Ricci G. et al., in “Die Makromoleculare Chemie”, Rapid Communications, (1986), Vol. 7, page 335. Further studies were then carried out with the aim of finding new catalytic systems comprising lanthanides and/or of improving the catalytic activity of already known catalytic systems. In particular, studies were mainly carried out on catalytic systems comprising neodymium as these catalytic systems had a higher catalytic activity with respect to catalytic systems comprising other lanthanides and they were capable of providing polymers which, after vulcanization, had a higher resistance to aging with respect to the polymers obtained with catalytic systems comprising titanium, cobalt and nickel. Furthermore, these studies were also supported by the great availability, at a low price, of the precursors, including neodymium. European patent EP 0 076 535, for example, describes an enhanced process for the (co)polymerization of conjugated diolefins comprising the use of a particular catalytic system including at least one compound of a metal selected from those of Group III B of the Periodic System having an atomic number between 21 and 103, preferably neodymium, a derivative of an organic halide and an organometallic compound containing aluminium such as, for example, alkyl aluminium hydride, or trialkyl aluminium hydride. Said process allows (co)polymers having a high content of 1,4-cis units (>98%) and a high linearity, to be obtained. U.S. Pat. No. 4,242,232 describes a catalyst comprising (a) a reaction mixture formed by reacting a carboxylate of a metal having an atomic number ranging from 57 to 71 such as, for example, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium with an aluminium tri-alkyl, (b) an aluminium alkyl and/or an aluminium alkyl hydride and (c) a Lewis acid. The polybutadiene obtained by using said catalyst has a content of 1,4-cis units ranging from 80% to 99%. In their simplest form, the catalytic systems comprising neodymium are obtained by reaction between neodymium trichloride, as such or complexed with donors (e.g. alcohols, ethers, tri-butyl-phosphate, alkyl-sulfoxides, amides, pyridine), and an aluminium tri-alkyl (e.g. aluminium tri-iso-butyl, aluminium tri-ethyl, aluminium tri-methyl): in this case, these are binary catalytic systems. Said binary catalytic systems are described, for example, by Yang J. H. et al., in “Macromolecules” (1982), Vol. 15(2), pages 230-233; Porri L. et al. in “Macromolecular Symposia” (1998), Vol. 128, Issue 1, pages 53-61. Alternatively, neodymium chloride can be obtained by reaction of a neodymium compound (e.g., alcoholate, carboxylate) with a chlorine donor (e.g., di-ethyl aluminium chloride, ethyl-aluminium dichloride, bis-aluminium tri-ethyl trichloride, t-butyl chloride) and then reacted with an aluminium alkyl or an aluminium tri-alkyl: in this case, these are tertiary catalytic systems. Said tertiary catalytic systems are described, for example, by: Cabassi F. et al. in “Transition Metal Catalyzed Polymerizations” (1988), Quirk R. P. Ed., Cambridge University Press, MA, USA, pages 655-670; Ricci G. et al. in “Polymer Communications Guilford” (1987), Vol. 28, Issue 8, pages 223-226; or in Italian patent IT 1,197,465. The order for adding the components (chlorine donor, aluminium alkyl or aluminium tri-alkyl) to the neodymium compound can be extremely important for the nature of the catalytic system to be obtained. By first adding aluminium alkyl hydride or aluminium tri-alkyl and only subsequently the chlorine donor, in fact, homogeneous catalysts are obtained; vice versa, when the chlorine donor is added before the aluminium alkyl hydride or aluminium tri-alkyl, heterogeneous systems are obtained, as described, for example, by Porri et al. in “ACS Symposium Series” (2000), Vol. 749, Chapter 2, pages 15-30. The order of adding the above-mentioned components is also decisive for the catalytic activity and for the polydispersity of the resulting polymers. In the binary and ternary catalytic systems mentioned above, however, the percentage of neodymium catalytically active is relatively low, normally ranging from 7% to 8% (said percentage referring to the molar percentage of active neodymium with respect to the total moles of neodymium charged), as described, for example, by Marina N. G. et al., in “Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR” (1982), Vol. 265, pages 1431-1433. Much more active ternary catalytic systems, containing a higher percentage of catalytically active neodymium, have been obtained by reaction between allyl compounds of neodymium, obtained by reaction between the complex of neodymium chloride with tetrahydrofuran (THF) and allyl Grignard, and aluminium alkyl [e.g., aluminium trialkyl, methylaluminoxane (MAO), tetra-iso-butyl-aluminoxane (TIBAO)], as described, for example, in Italian patent IT 1,228,442; or by: Porri L. et al. in “Macromolecular Symposia” (1993), Vol. 66, pages 231-244; Porri L. et al. in “Polymer Preprints”, “American Chemical Society Division Polymer Chemistry” (1998), Vol. 39, pages 214-215; Porri L. in “Recent developments in Lanthanide catalysts for 1,3-diene polymerization”, in “ACS Symposium Series 749—Olefin Polymerization: Emerging Frontiers” (2000), P. Arjunan, J. C. McGrath and T. Hanlon Eds., Oxford University Press, USA, pages 15-30. Said ternary catalytic systems provide a polybutadiene having a much lower polydispersity than those obtained by means of the classical ternary catalytic systems mentioned above. Furthermore, said ternary catalytic systems can also produce polyisoprene and/or other polymers deriving from the (co)polymerization of substituted butadienes, providing (co)polymers with a high content of 1,4-cis units (i.e. content≧90%). In particular, a polymer is obtained from the polymerization of isoprene, having a content of 1,4-cis units equal to about 94%, which can be advantageously used for producing elastomeric blends for the production of tyres. As mentioned above, due to the fact that the (co)polymers of conjugated dienes, in particular polybutadiene and polyisoprene, with a high content of 1,4-cis units, are the polymers most widely used on an industrial scale, in particular for the production of tyres, the study of new catalytic systems capable of providing said (co)polymers, is still of great interest. The Applicant has faced the problem of finding a new oxo-nitrogenated complex of lanthanides that can be used in a catalytic system capable of providing (co)polymers of conjugated dienes, in particular polybutadiene and polyisoprene, linear or branched, with a high content of 1,4-cis units, i.e. a content of 1,4-cis units≧99% in the case of polybutadiene, and ≧98% in the case of polyisoprene. Furthermore, said polyisoprene has a glass transition temperature (Tg) similar to that of natural rubber.

Tetrakis-pentafluorophenyl-borate is preferred. Alternatively, the compounds (b3) can be selected from compounds having formula B(Ar)3 wherein Ar has the same meanings described above; or from compounds having formula B(Ar)3P wherein Ar has the same meanings described above and P is a pyrrole radical optionally substituted. Further details relating to aluminium alkyls (b1), aluminoxanes (b2) and compounds (b3), can be found in international patent application WO 2011/061151. For the aim of the present description and of the following claims, the term “moles” and “molar ratio” are used with reference to compounds consisting of molecules and also with reference to atoms and ions, omitting, for the latter, the terms gram atom or atomic ratio, even if scientifically more correct. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in said catalytic system, the molar ratio between the lanthanide present in the oxo-nitrogenated complex of lanthanides (a) having general formula (I) or (II) and the aluminium present in the co-catalyst (b) selected from aluminium alkyls (b1) or aluminoxanes (b2), can range from 5 to 5,000, preferably from 10 to 1,000. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in said catalytic system, the molar ratio between the lanthanide present in the oxo-nitrogenated complex of lanthanides (a) having general formula (I) or (II) and the boron present in the co-catalyst (b) selected from compounds (b3) having general formula (IV), can range from 0.1 to 15, preferably from 0.5 to 10. For the aim of the present invention, other additives or components can be optionally added to the above catalytic system in order to adapt it so as to satisfy specific practical requirements. The catalytic systems thus obtained should therefore be considered as being included in the scope of the present invention. Additives and/or components which can be added in the preparation and/or formulation of the catalytic system object of the present invention are, for example, inert solvents, such as, for example, aliphatic and/or aromatic hydrocarbons; aliphatic and/or aromatic ethers; weakly coordinating additives (e.g. Lewis bases) selected, for example, from non-polymerizable olefins; sterically hindered or electronically poor ethers; halogenating agents such as, for example, silicon halides, halogenated hydrocarbons, preferably chlorinated; or mixtures thereof. Said catalytic system can be prepared according to methods known in the art. Said catalytic system, for example, can be prepared separately (preformed) and subsequently introduced into the (co)polymerization environment. In this respect, said catalytic system can be prepared by reacting at least one oxo-nitrogenated complex of lanthanides (a) having general formula (I) or (II) with at least one co-catalyst (b), optionally in the presence of other additives or components selected from those listed above, in the presence of a solvent such as, for example, toluene, heptane, at a temperature ranging from 20° C. to 60° C., for a time ranging from 10 seconds to 10 hours, preferably from 30 seconds to 5 hours. More details on the preparation of said catalytic system can be found in the examples provided hereunder. Alternatively, said catalytic system can be prepared in situ, i.e. directly in the (co)polymerization environment. In this respect, said catalytic system can be prepared by introducing the oxo-nitrogenated complex of lanthanides (a) having general formula (I) or (II), the co-catalyst (b) and the preselected conjugated diene(s) to be (co)polymerized, separately, operating under the conditions in which the (co)polymerization is carried out. For the aim of the present invention, the above catalytic systems can also be supported on inert solids, preferably consisting of silicon and/or aluminium oxides, such as, for example, silica, alumina or silico-aluminates. The known supporting techniques can be used for supporting said catalytic systems, generally comprising the contact, in a suitable inert liquid medium, between the carrier, optionally activated by heating to temperatures higher than 200° C., and one or both of components (a) and (b) of the catalytic system object of the present invention. For the aim of the present invention, it is not necessary for both components to be supported, as the oxo-nitrogenated complex of lanthanides (a) having general formula (I) or (II) only, or the co-catalyst (b) only, can be present on the surface of the carrier. In the latter case, the missing component on the surface is subsequently put in contact with the supported component, at the moment in which the catalyst active for the polymerization is to be formed. The oxo-nitrogenated complex of lanthanides having general formula (I) or (II), and the catalytic systems based thereon, which have been supported on a solid by the functionalization of the latter and the formation of a covalent bond between the solid and the oxo-nitrogenated complex of lanthanides having general formula (I) or (II), are also included in the aim of the present invention. The present invention also relates to a process for the (co)polymerization of conjugated dienes, characterized in that it uses said catalytic system. The quantity of oxo-nitrogenated complex of lanthanides (a) having general formula (I) or (II) and of co-catalyst (b) that can be used in the (co)polymerization of conjugated dienes varies according to the (co)polymerization process to be carried out. Said quantity is in any case such as to obtain a molar ratio between the lanthanide present in the oxo-nitrogenated complex of lanthanides (a) having general formula (I) or (II) and the metal present in the co-catalyst (b), i.e. aluminium when the co-catalyst (b) is selected from aluminium alkyls (b1) or aluminoxanes (b2), boron when the co-catalyst (b) is selected from compounds (b3) having general formula (V), comprised within the values indicated above. Specific examples of conjugated dienes which can be (co)polymerized using the catalytic system according to the present invention are: 1,3-butadiene, 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene (isoprene), 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, 1,3-hexadiene, cyclo-1,3-hexadiene. Preferred (co)polymerizable conjugated dienes are 1,3-butadiene, isoprene. The above (co)polymerizable conjugated dienes can be used alone, or in a mixture of two or more dienes. In the latter case, i.e. using a mixture of two or more dienes, a copolymer is obtained. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a polymerization process of 1,3-butadiene or isoprene, characterized in that it uses said catalytic system. Said (co)polymerization is generally carried out in the presence of a polymerization solvent generally selected from inert organic solvents such as, for example, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as, for example, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, or mixtures thereof; saturated cyclo-aliphatic hydrocarbons such as, for example, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, or mixtures thereof; mono-olefins such as, for example, 1-butene, 2-butene, or mixtures thereof; aromatic hydrocarbons such as, for example, benzene, toluene, xylene, or mixtures thereof; halogenated hydrocarbons such as, for example, methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, bromobenzene, chlorotoluene, or mixtures thereof. The (co)polymerization solvent is preferably selected from saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. Alternatively, said (co)polymerization can be carried out using, as (co)polymerization solvent, the same conjugated diene(s) to be (co)polymerized, according to the process known as “bulk process”. The concentration of conjugated diene to be (co)polymerized in said (co)polymerization solvent generally ranges from 5% by weight to 50% by weight, preferably from 10% by weight to 20% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the conjugated diene/solvent mixture. Generally, said (co)polymerization can be carried out at a temperature ranging from −70° C. to +100° C., preferably from −20° C. to +80° C. As far as the pressure is concerned, it is preferable to operate at the pressure of the components of the mixture to be (co)polymerized. Said (co)polymerization can be carried out either in continuous or batchwise. As indicated above, the use of the oxo-nitrogenated complex of lanthanides having general formula (I) or (II) allows (co)polymers of conjugated dienes to be obtained, in particular linear or branched polybutadiene and polyisoprene, with a high content of 1,4-cis units, i.e. a content of 1,4-cis units≧99% in the case of polybutadiene, and ≧98% in the case of polyisoprene. Some illustrative and non-limiting examples are provided hereunder for a better understanding of the present invention and for its practical embodiment.

The analysis and characterization methods indicated below were used. Elemental Analysis a) Determination of Nd For the determination of the weight quantity of the metal Nd in the oxo-nitrogenated complexes of lanthanides object of the present invention, an aliquot weighed exactly, operating in a dry-box under a nitrogen flow, of about 30-50 mg of sample, was placed in a platinum crucible of about 30 ml, together with a mixture of 1 ml of hydrofluoric acid (HF) at 40%, 0.25 ml of sulfuric (H2SO4) at 96% and 1 ml of nitric acid (HNO3) at 70%. The crucible was then heated on a plate, increasing the temperature until the appearance of white sulfuric fumes (about 200° C.). The mixture thus obtained was cooled to room temperature (20° C.-25° C.), 1 ml of nitric acid (HNO3) at 70% was added and the mixture was then heated until the appearance of fumes. After repeating the sequence a further two times, a limpid, almost colourless solution was obtained. 1 ml of nitric acid (HNO3) and about 15 ml of water were then added, without heat, and the mixture was then heated to 80° C. for about 30 minutes. The sample thus prepared was diluted with water having a MilliQ purity up to a weight of about 50 g, weighed exactly, to obtain a solution on which analytical instrumental determination was carried out using an ICP-OES (optical detection plasma) Thermo Optek IRIS Advantage Duo spectrometer, by comparison with solutions at a known concentration. For this aim, a calibration curve was prepared for each analyte, within the range of 0 ppm-10 ppm, measuring solutions having a known titre obtained by weight dilution of certified solutions. The solution of the sample prepared as described above was diluted again by weight so as to obtain concentrations close to those used as reference, before carrying out spectrophotometric detection. All the samples were prepared in duplicate. The results were considered acceptable if the single data of the tests in duplicate did not differ by more than 2% relative with respect to their average value. b) Chlorine Determination For this aim, samples of the oxo-nitrogenated complexes of lanthanides object of the present invention, about 30 mg-50 mg, were weighed exactly in 100 ml glasses in a dry-box under a stream of nitrogen. 2 g of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and, outside the dry-box, 50 ml of MilliQ water, were added. The mixture was brought to boiling point on a plate, under magnetic stirring, for about 30 minutes. It was left to cool, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) diluted 1/5, was added until the reaction became acid and the mixture was titrated with silver nitrate (AgNO3) 0.1N with a potentiometer titrimeter. c) Determination of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen The determination of the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, in the oxo-nitrogenated complexes of lanthanides object of the present invention, and also in the ligands used for the purposes of the present invention, was carried out by means of an automatic analyzer Carlo Erba Mod. 1106. 13C-HMR and 1H-HMR Spectra The 13C-HMR and 1H-HMR spectra were registered by means of a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer mod. Bruker Avance 400, using deuterated tetrachloroethylene (C2D2Cl4) at 103° C., and hexamethyldisiloxane (HDMS) as internal standard, or using deuterated chloroform (CDCl3), at 25° C., and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. Solutions of the ligands used in the present invention or polymeric solutions having concentrations equal to 10% by weight with respect to the total weight of the solution of ligands used in the present invention or polymeric solution, respectively, were used for the aim. The microstructure of the polymers [i.e. content of 1,4-cis units (%)] was determined by analysis of the above spectra on the basis of what is indicated in literature by Mochel, V. D., in “Journal of Polymer Science Part A-1: Polymer Chemistry” (1972), Vol. 10, Issue 4, pages 1009-1018, for polybutadiene; and by Sato, H., et al., in “Journal of Polymer Science: Polymer Chemistry Edition” (1979), Vol. 17, Issue 11, pages 3551-3558 for polyisoprene. I.R. Spectra The I.R. spectra (FT-IR) were registered by means of a Bruker IFS 48 spectrophotometer. The I.R. spectra (FT-IR) of the ligands used in the present invention were obtained by dispersing the ligand to be analyzed in anhydrous potassium bromide (KBr) (disks of KBr), or in a suspension of nujol or tetramethyl silane (TMS). The I.R. spectra (FT-IR) of the oxo-nitrogenated complexes of lanthanides object of the present invention, were obtained by dispersing the oxo-nitrogenated complex of lanthanides to be analyzed in anhydrous potassium bromide (KBr) (disks of KBr), or in a suspension of nujol. The I.R. spectra (FT-IR) of the polymers were obtained from polymeric films on tablets of potassium bromide (KBr), said films being obtained by deposition of a solution of the polymer to be analyzed in hot o-dichlorobenzene. The concentration of the polymeric solutions analyzed was equal to 10% by weight with respect to the total weight of the polymeric solution. Thermal Analysis (DSC) The DSC (“Differential Scanning calorimetry”) thermal analysis, for determining the melting point (Tm) and the crystallization temperature (Tc) of the polymers obtained, was carried out using a Perkin Elmer Pyris differential scanning calorimeter. For this aim, 5 mg of polymer were analyzed, with a scanning rate ranging from 1° C./min to 20° C./min, in an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The DSC (“Differential Scanning calorimetry”) thermal analysis, for determining the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymers obtained and of the natural rubber (NR), was carried out by means of the above calorimeter, using the following thermal program: isotherm for 3 minutes at +70° C.; cooling from +70° C. to −90° C. at a rate of 10° C./min; isotherm for 3 min at −90° C.; heating from −90° C. to +70° C. at a rate of 10° C./min. Molecular Weight Determination The determination of the molecular weight (MW) of the polymers obtained was carried out by means of GPC (“Gel Permeation Chromatography”) operating under the following conditions: Agilent 1100 pump;I.R. Agilent 1100 detector;PL Mixed-A columns;solvent/eluent: tetrahydrofuran (THF);flow-rate: 1 ml/min;temperature: 25° C.;molecular mass calculation: Universal Calibration method. The weight average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity Index (PDI) corresponding to the Mw/Mn ratio (Mn=number average molecular weight), are specified. Determination of the Branching The determination of the branching of the polymers obtained was carried out by means of the GPC/MALLS technique obtained by coupling a multi-angle light scattering detector (MALLS) with a traditional SEC/RI elution system, operating under the following conditions: Agilent 1050 pump;I.R. Agilent 1050 detector;MALLS Dawn-DSP Wyatt detector—Technology, λ=632.8 nm;PL GEL Mixed-A (×4) columns;solvent/eluent: tetrahydrofuran (THF);flow-rate: 1 ml/min;temperature: 25° C. Operating as described above, the absolute measurement can be contemporaneously carried out of the molecular weight and gyration radius of the macromolecules that are separated by the chromatographic system: the quantity of light scattered from a macromolecular species in solution can in fact be used directly for obtaining its molecular weight, whereas the angular variation in the scattering is directly correlated to its average dimensions. The fundamental relation which is used is represented by the following equation (1): K * ⁢ c R θ = 1 M w ⁢ P θ + 2 ⁢ A 2 ⁢ c ( 1 ) wherein: K* is the optical constant which depends on the wavelength of the light used, the refraction index (dn/dc) of the polymer, the solvent used;Mw is the weight average molecular weight;c is the concentration of the polymeric solution;Rθ is the intensity of the light scattered, measured at the angle θ (excess Rayleigh factor);Pθ is the function describing the variation of the light scattered with the angle at which it is measured, for an angle θ equal to 0;A2 is the second virial coefficient. For very low concentrations (typical of a GPC system), the equation (1) indicated above is reduced to the following equation (2): K * ⁢ c R θ = 1 M w ⁢ P θ ( 2 ) wherein K*, c, Rθ, Mw and Pθ, have the same meanings defined above, and by carrying out the measurement on several angles, the extrapolation to angle null of the function K*c/Rθ in relation to sen2θ/2 directly provides the molecular weight from the intercept value and the gyration radius of the slope. Furthermore, as this measurement is carried out for every slice of the chromatogram, it is possible to obtain a distribution of both the molecular weight and the gyration radius. The macromolecular dimensions in solution are directly correlated to their branching degree: for the same molecular weight, the smaller the dimensions of the macromolecule with respect to the linear correspondent, the higher the branching degree will be. Informations relating to the macrostructure of the polymer is qualitatively deduced from the value of the parameter α, which represents the slope of the curve which correlates the gyration radius with the molecular weight: when, under the same analysis conditions, this value decreases with respect to a macrostructure of the linear type, there is the presence of a polymer having a branched-type macrostructure. The typical value of the parameter α for linear polybutadiene having a high content of 1,4-cis units, in tetrahydrofuran (THF), is equal to 0.58-0.60.
