Field of the Invention The present invention relates to bacteria strains and fungus isolates which can dissolve the CaCO3 mineral in the magnesite ore via biological mechanisms. Background of the Invention Magnesite is a mineral, which theoretically comprises 47.8% MgO and 52.2% CO2 and a trace amount of Fe2O3. and whose specific gravity varies in the range of 2.9-3.1 g/cm3 depending on its content. Magnesite, which is the main source of magnesium element and various compounds thereof can be used in many fields from production of refractory brick to pharmaceutical products (Özdemir et al., 2009). Due to the fact that magnesium is a reactive element, magnesite ore is not present in any source at a purity that allows it to be used directly (Bentl1 et al., 2004). Magnesite ores contain various amounts of Ca, Si, Fe, Mg and Al elements as impurities (Gürcan et al., 2012). The impurities around the magnesite should be removed in order for it to become commercially usable. As the purity of the mineral increases, its value increases as well. Therefore the mineral is subjected to various physical and chemical processes such as magnetic separation, hand sorting, heavy medium separation and flotation (Gence, 2001). Magnesite processing technology starts with extracting ore from the mineral deposit. The mineral is subjected to various enrichment processes after being extracted from the deposit. Enrichment process is separation of the ore from the gang minerals. Characteristic gang minerals of crystalline magnesite are dolomite, biotite, garnet, talc, quartz; and of gel magnesite are serpentine and opal. Generally triage (hand sorting), heavy medium enrichment, magnetic separation, electrostatic separation, flotation enrichment, calcination and optical enrichment methods are used for enrichment of magnesite (Kocaefe 1982; Erdogan and Yildiz 1995). The method of heavy medium enrichment is based on the density difference between the magnesite material and gang minerals. Ferrosilicon (6,8 gr/cm3), which is a very dense material, is used for this process. With this method, substances that are denser than ferrosilicon precipitate while the lighter substances float. Hand sorting is an observational method, which is based on man power. Magnesite is separated from the other minerals according to color differences. Magnetic enrichment method is a type of separation based on magnetic properties of the minerals. Magnetic enrichment is used for separating ferromagnetic and paramagnetic gang materials from magnesite since magnesite is a non-metal and non-magnetic mineral. Flotation is an enrichment method for separating magnesite from calcium carbonate and silica wherein oleic acid and a small amount of carbon dioxide are used as media. The most important disadvantage of this method is cost. Due to the high cost of this method, magnetic enrichment and hand sorting methods are preferred more (Ozdemir et al., 2009). Calcination is the process of obtaining a more dense and solid magnesite by heating to high temperatures and removing carbondioxide. When magnesite is heated to 650-1100°C in a controlled manner, calcined magnesite is obtained. This magnesite is reactive. When magnesite is heated up to 1400-1800°C, sintered magnesite is obtained. This magnesite is slightly reactive (Chen and Tao, 2004). Due to economic reasons, the most common ones of these enrichment methods are hand sorting, magnetic separation and calcination (Gence, 2001; Demir and Dönmez, 2009). Although these physical and chemicals methods are widely used for treatment of sediments contaminated with metals, they have disadvantages such as the high cost and high amount of waste resulting due to the facts that low quality ores cannot be enriched, the amount of recovered product is low, refractory materials is used in many processes and high amounts of energy are required (Rulkens 1995; Sever 2006). In addition, studies are conducted by the researchers in many countries on biological applications in mining for the last 40 years (Hoque and Philip, 2011). This process, which is defined as biomining, has provided an alternative to the physical and chemical methods (Rawlings and Johnson, 2007; Brierley, 2008; Appana et al., 2011). Biomining, which is an economic method even in environment friendly and low quality mines as opposed to the conventional methods, is still being used in copper, gold, silver, cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, zinc and lead mines with Acidithiobacillusferrooxidans, Acidithiobacillusthiooxidans, Acidithiobacilluscaldus, Leptospirillumferrooxidans ve Leptospirillumferriphilum microorganisms (Baret and Hughes, 1993; Watling, 2006; Siddiqui et al., 2009;Hoque and Philip, 2011). The Chinese patent document no. CN102976640, an application in the state of the art, discloses about obtaining high-quality magnesite and calcination carried out at super high-temperature in order to obtain it. The Chinese Patent document no CN103241751, an application known in the state of the art, discloses about obtaining a high-purity magnesium oxide. The said document also discloses about discharge of a high amount of carbon dioxide and removal thereof from the environment. The Chinese patent document no. CN102126734, an application in the state of the art, discloses that washing and neutralization processes are carried out for obtaining magnesite. Summary of the Invention The objective of the present invention is to provide new bacteria strains and fungus isolates which enable to enrich magnesite. Another objective of the present invention is to provide new bacteria strains and fungus isolates which provide more economic and environment friendly dissolving process than the known methods. A further objective of the present invention is to provide new bacteria strains and fungus isolates which enable to enrich low quality mines. Another objective of the present invention is to provide new bacteria strains and fungus isolates wherein chemicals are not used during dissolving process, and which do not discharge environmentally hazardous wastes. Another objective of the present invention is to provide new bacteria strains and fungus isolates which do not consume high energy during decalcification. A further objective of the present invention is to provide new bacteria strains and fungus isolates which eliminates the cost for transporting the mine as it can be applied in a mineral deposit. Another objective of the present invention is to provide new bacteria strains and fungus isolates which decrease labor and reduce worker cost since it eliminates a great deal of process steps in comparison to the known methods in decalcification. Detailed Description of the Invention "Bacteria strains and fungus isolates dissolving CaCO3 biologically" developed to fulfill the objective of the present invention is illustrated in the accompanying figures wherein, Figure 1 is the graphical representation of magnesite demineralization of Enterecoccus spp. strain and the free Mg and Ca content.Figure 2 is the graphical representation of magnesite demineralization of Lactococcus spp. strain and the free Mg and Ca content.Figure 3 is the graphical representation of magnesite demineralization of Staphylococcus spp. strain and the free Mg and Ca content.Figure 4 is the graphical representation of magnesite demineralization of Neurospora spp. strain and the free Mg and Ca content. Four bacteria strains are used for decalcifying the magnesite of the present invention. Two of the strains of the present invention were deposited in United States Department of Agriculture Research, Education and Economics Agricultural Research Service on January 28, 2009. Accordingly, deposit numbers of the strains named Lactococcus garviae A1, Enterococcus faecalis EF1-06, Staphylococcus spp. and Neurospora spp. were recorded as NRRL B-50196, NRRL B-50198 respectively. The other two of the strains of the present invention were deposited in Leibniz Institute DSMZ German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures ((LeibnizInstitut DSMZ-Deutschesammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbHon) on October 17, 2013). Accordingly, deposit numbers of Staphylococcus warneri GSK1 strain and Neurospora tetrasperma GNT1 isolate were recorded as DSM 27873 and DSM 27874 respectively. In order to obtain high purity magnesium from magnesite, CaCO3 (calcium carbonate) in the medium should be removed. Enterococcus spp.and Lactococcus spp. strains were isolated from the rock. Staphylococcus warneri and Neurospora tetrasperma were isolated from a magnesite mine. While the isolates Enterococcus spp. Lactococcus spp., Staphylococcus warneir are gram-positive bacteria, Neurospora tetrasperma is a fungus. The microorganisms of the present invention are mesophilic as they are isolated from natural environment. Experimental studies Granulated magnesite (MgCO3) mineral was used in the experimental studies. By carrying out experimental studies in a medium containing calcium carbonate, a medium with magnesite was prepared. In preparation of the medium; 5g yeast extract, 5g glucose, 6g magnesite (MgCO3) and 500 ml water were used. The medium was sterilized using an autoclave. Enterococcus spp. Lactococcus spp. Staplylococcus warneri strains and Neurospora tetrasperma isolate were inoculated to the magnesite-containing medium and was incubated at 30°C and 150 rpm (Sharafi et al. 2010). Samples were taken during the study at certain intervals in order to make measurements. The elemental analyses were performed with ICP-MS device. The samples, which were taken in a sterile cabin, were filtered through a 0.2 µm filter. The filtered samples were diluted to 100µl/10ml (filtrate/ 2% HNO3) and Mg and Ca amount were measured by the ICP-MS device. While these microorganisms are used alone in purification of magnesium, they can also be used in different combinations with each other. Experiment results Enterococcus spp., Lactococcus spp., Staphylococcus warneir strains and Neurospora tetrasperma isolate were incubated in the magnesite-containing medium; and elemental analyses were conducted by means of ICP-MS for measuring free Mg and Ca amount (Danadurai et al., 2011). The results for the magnesite demineralization at the end of the measurement are shown in Figure 1, 2, 3, 4. Free magnesium that is liberated as a result demineralization is shown in Figure 1. The free calcium content increasing at the same time shows that Enterecoccus spp. strain dissolves CaCO3. While the columns that we name as the total show the initial Mg and Ca contents, the other columns show the free Mg and Ca content which are liberated by being dissolved by microorganisms in time. The same results were observed when the other microorganisms of the present invention were used (Figure 2, 3, 4). The microorganisms of the present invention, can be in the form of a liquid or solid solution, powder, granule. Bacteria microorganisms are applied for mine demineralization, elimination of the clogging in irrigation systems, and decalcifying alkaline soils making them fertile.
