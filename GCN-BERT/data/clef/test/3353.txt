Step 4: preparation of intermediate trans-6-allyloxy-2-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-4-oxazol-5-yl-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (1e)
In a sealed flask, a mixture of trans-6-allyloxy-2-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-4-iodo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (1d) (5.20 g, 11.55 mmol), 5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,2,3-dioxaborolan-2-yl)oxazole (2.70 g, 13.86 mmol) and Cs2CO3 (7.52 g, 23.09 mmol) in anhydrous THF (100 mL) was degassed under argon for 5 min and Pd(PPh3)4 (400 mg, 0.35 mmol) was added. The mixture was heated at 60Â°C overnight. H2O was added and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (cyclohexane/EtOAc 100/0 to 70/30) to give trans-6-allyloxy-2-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-4-oxazol-5-yl-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (1e) (3.64 g, 9.30 mmol, 80%).
