[DISCLOSURE] [TITLE OF INVENTION] DISHWASHER [TECHNICAL FIELD] The present invention concerns a dishwasher, and more specifically, to a support that is provided at a side wall of a rack to mount dishes. [DISCUSSION OF RELATED ART] In general, a dishwasher includes a rack to receive dishes in a tub, a washing arm that allows washing water to be jet to dishes in the rack, and a washing pump and washing motor to supply washing water to the washing arm. The dishwasher is configured so that the washing pump is driven to jet washing water stored in a sump to the washing arm. Further, washing water is jet from the washing arm at high pressure to hit the surface of the dishes in the rack. As such, high-pressure washing water hits the surface of the dishes and thus removes wastes remaining on the dishes’ surface. Further, dish washing sequentially proceeds with the steps of washing out the wastes from the dishes, rinsing the dishes after washing, and drying the dishes to remove moisture from the surface of the dishes after rinsing. After washing, the used washing water, together with the detergent and wastes, is collected in the sump, and is then drained to the outside. At least one or more racks may be included in the dishwasher to mount dishes. Preferably, two or more ones are provided withdrawnably. Dishes such as bowls, cups, and spoons and chopsticks, are received in the rack. Meanwhile, a support may be pivotably provided in a rack to be able to receive dishes in such a way that the dishes are stacked one over another. The support is expanded towards the center of the rack when used, and is left to stand at a side wall of the rack. Whether to use the support may depend on the height of a dish to be received in the rack. However, since the support is installed in the rack, a portion of the support, which is coupled with the rack, protrudes to the inside of the rack. In this case, the support may interfere with the dishes and the space for accommodating dishes is reduced. Further, the width of the support may be limited to reduce interference with other racks positioned over the support, which may arise when the support is left upright. Further, every part in the support is located in the dishes accommodating space, so that the support needs to be first laid down in order to prevent collision with the dishes when moving the support up and down. [SUMMARY] The present invention seeks to minimize the likelihood that the support would reduce a dishes accommodating space. The present invention also seeks to prevent interference with other racks even without reducing the width of the support. The present invention also seeks to minimize interference with dishes in the rack when the support moves up and down. The present invention also seeks to allow the support to be freely maneuvered even while dishes are accommodated.

According to an embodiment of the present invention, the dishwasher 1 includes a tub 3 forming a space for washing dishes, a rack 10 having a dishes accommodating space S and disposed in the tub 3, and a support 20 that is laid down in the dishes accommodating space S to mount dishes and that is moved downward, inserted through a space between the wires forming the rack 10 so that the area of arrangement in the dishes accommodating space S is reduced in an upright position as compared with when it is put in a laid position. The support 20 is disposed to be moved up and down, inserted between the wires forming the rack 10, so that a portion thereof remains in the dishes accommodating space S while the remainder thereof is projected to the outside of the rack 10. The area of the support 20, which is left in the dishes accommodating space S, varies depending on the position of the support 20. The support 20 is uplifted so that it can be laid down. As the support 20 is lifted up, the area of the support 20 is increased. The support 20 moves down to be erected. The support 20 is moved down until it is stuck by the wire forming the rack 10. Accordingly y, the area of the support 20 is reduced as much as the support 20 is moved. Here, the area of the support 20 means an area that is left in the dishes accommodating space S. The operation of the dishwasher 1 configured as above, according to the present invention, is described below. A user puts a dish 7 to be washed in the rack 10. The user would not need to use the support 20 if there are not many dishes 7 or if the dish 7 to be washed is relatively high. In such case, the user leaves the support 20 to stand at a side wall of the rack 10. First, the user puts the support 20, which is left laid toward the dish 7 washing space, in an upright position toward the side wall of the rack 10. Then, the user may adjust the height of the support 20 by moving down the support 20 in the vertical direction. The support 20 is arranged to move up and down between the side wall of the rack 10 and the body 35, and thus, does not fall down as it moves down. Further, the vertical part 33 has a guide groove 33a, and the main protrusion 27 and the sub protrusion 29 are inserted to the guide groove 33a via the expanded groove 33b, thus enabling stable vertical shift. Further, if the support 20 is rendered to stand upright, inserted to the side wall of the rack 10, the rotation shaft 20a is arranged at an outside of the rack 10, thus minimizing the area that invades the dishes accommodating space S. More specifically, the support 20 invades only the upper dishes accommodating space S1. Accordingly, the support 20 does not invade the lower dishes accommodating space S2. Meanwhile, in case more dishes 7 are accommodated in the rack 10, the user arranges a dish 7 that is lower at a side wall of the rack 10. Thereafter, the support 20 that is left upright is shifted to an upper side. The main protrusion 27 and the sub protrusion 29 are moved to the upper side along the guide groove 33a, and if reach a predetermined height, the sub protrusion 29 is detached to the upper side via the expanded groove 33b. Further, the hook 21 is fixed to the hinge 31. If the hook 21 and the hinge 31 are hinge-coupled with each other, the support 20 ends up being in a state where it can pivot. The user lays the support 20 onto the dish 7 and then may place other dishes 7 on the support 20. By the above configuration, the hook 21 of the support 20 is always arranged outside the rack 10, and in case the support 20 is not used, the dishes accommodating space may be thus maximized. Further, since the support 20 is not interfered by the dish 7 upon its up-and-down movement, it is not required to arrange the dish 7 up and down the support 20 after the support 20 is put in a laid position like in the conventional art. While the present invention has been shown and described in connection with embodiments thereof, it is understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the present invention defined by the following claims [DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENTS] 1: dishwasher 3: tub 5 5: roller 7: dish 10: rack 11: fixed wire 13: bottom part 14: ceiling part 16: upper side wall part 17: lower side wall part 18: expansion part 20: support 10 20a: rotation shaft 21:hook 23: flat plate part 25: connecting part 27: main protrusion 29: sub protrusion 30: bracket 31: hinge 33: vertical part 33a: guide groove 15 33b: expanded groove 35:body 36: rib 37: seating part 38: pressurizing part 39: holder S: dishes accommodating space S1: upper dishes accommodating space S2: lower dishes accommodating space Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps.
