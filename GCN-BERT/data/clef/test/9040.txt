Fluoroalkylfluorene derivatives Field of the invention The present invention relates to novel compounds with electronic and photoelectronic properties that render them useful for the production of electrical devices. The invention further relates to electronic devices that incorporate layers comprising these compounds wherein these compounds function as charge transport materials or photoluminescent materials. Background of the invention Organic light emitting diodes (OLED) are light emitting diodes in which the emissive electroluminescent material is a film of organic material which emits light in response to an electrical current. The emissive organic layer of an OLED is sandwiched between two electrical contact layers. For enhanced efficiency, in addition to a light emitting layer, the OLED device may incorporate layers of charge transporting material between the emissive layer and the electrical contact layer. These charge transporting layers may comprise either hole or electron transporting materials. These charge transport materials can allow the charge- carrying holes and electrons to migrate through to the emissive layer, thereby facilitating their combination to form a bound state called an exciton. The electrons in the excitons in due course relax into a lower energy state by emitting radiation which, for an OLED device, is of a frequency most often in the visible region. There is considerable ongoing interest in the development of new materials with improved properties that are suitable for use in the fabrication of OLED devices. Materials that, for example, function as emitters, electron transporters and hole transporters are of particular interest. Many materials have been developed over the years in the attempt to produce improved OLED devices and in particular devices with optimal light output, energy efficiency and life time. In addition, a further notable goal is the realisation of materials that allow the device fabrication process to be simplified. Notwithstanding existing materials, there is a continuing need for materials that have properties such as those identified above that possess superior combination of properties for the fabrication of OLED devices and other electronic devices. It is known that some reactive mesogens (liquid crystalline materials capable of being chemically crosslinked into a polymer matrix) of the general formula: B-S-A-S-B where A represents a linear aromatic molecular core comprising a fluorene substituted with two alkyl groups at C-9, S represents flexible spacer units and B represents crosslinking groups such as methacrylate groups, may be useful in the fabrication of organic electronic devices. This is particularly the case if B represents a photo-crosslinkable group, since then the materials function essentially as photoresists, which is to say, thin layers of these materials may be patterned into useful electronic structures by patterned exposure to light, particularly UV light. Further, if the linear aromatic core A is luminescent in nature, these reactive mesogen materials may be patterned into the active light emitting layers in electroluminescent devices such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDS) and organic diode lasers. However, working OLED devices of the B-S-A-S-B structure have exhibited disappointingly low lifetimes. It is an object of the present invention to provide new fluorene containing materials for use in electronic devices which overcome, or substantially reduce, problems associated with existing fluorene derivatives.

Detailed description of the invention According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of the D-S1-A-S2-B1 wherein the groups D, B1 , S\ S2 and A are the chemical groups defined herein. A represents a group of the formula -Ar1-(FL-Ar2)n-. The component parts of the system are connected to each other through covalent bonds. This group may also be p Formula 1 So that the invention may be better understood the nature of the constituent groups and their function is defined herein. Ar1-(FL-Ar2)n- The compounds of the invention comprise a -Ar1-(FL-Ar2)n- group, abbreviated as A, that forms a "substantially linear", or "lathe like", aromatic core of the compound. In this structure FL is a fluorene diradical of the structure below that is incorporated into the chain through covalent bonds at C-2 and 0-1. The integer n in -Ar1-(FL-Ar2)n- is from 1 to 8. In total each -Ar1-(FL-Ar2)n- group comprises from 1 to 8 FL groups. In certain preferred aspects, the number of FL each -Ar1-(FL-Ar2)n- group is selected from 1 to 6, 1 to 3, 3 to 6, or 5, or 6. In the preferred aspect where the compounds of the present invention are suitable for use as light emitters each -Ar1-(FL-Ar2)n- group comprises between 3 and 6 FL groups. This is because lower n values lead to molecules with lower light emission efficiency. In embodiments where the compounds of the present invention are suitable for use as a hole transporter, an electron transporter, or a host for a light emitting dopant, -Ar1-(FL-Ar2)n- groups with 1 to 3 FL groups are preferred because of their ease of synthesis, lower melting points and higher solubilities. In this -Ar1-(FL-Ar2)n- or A structure the R groups of each individual FL are identical when n is greater than 1 because of the potential for multiple isomers of the material that make purification challenging. For materials with n = 1 having different R groups in different FL groups can be advantageous because this may cause the melting points to be lowered. The R groups are selected from straight chain or branched achiral Ci-Cn alkyl, C1-C14 haloalkyl, C1-C14 fluoroalkyl, C2-C14 alkenyl group, optionally wherein 1 , 2, 3, 4 or 5 CH2 groups are replaced an oxygen so that no acetal, ketal, peroxide or vinyl ether is present. In other words, if more than one methylene group is replaced by an oxygen atom it will be separated from the next oxygen atom in the chain by at least three covalent bonds. When the R groups are alkenyl groups it is preferred that the alkene is a terminal alkene because the viscosity of the product can be lowered by incorporating a terminal alkene in the R group. Ar1 and Ar2 in each occurrence are independently selected from the group comprising Ar3 and a bond. Ar3 represents a diradical comprising 1 aromatic, heteroaromatic or FL moiety, or 2, 3, 4 or 5 aromatic, heteroaromatic and/or FL moieties mutually connected by a single bond. The overall Ar1-(FL-Ar2)n chain is "substantially linear" and is devoid of significant branching that would destroy its linearity, its ability to align with adjacent molecules and favours liquid crystallinity. Certain elements of the chain may project from the linear structure. For example, when Ar1 is a naphthalene-1 ,4-diyl, carbons 5 to 8 project from the side of the chain even though the naphthyl structure is integral to the chain. It can be appreciated that although the chain as a whole is described as linear the nature of the chemical bonds that connect the component parts of the chain dictates that all the chemical bonds in the chain will not be exactly aligned. So long as any curvature in the backbone of the molecular core of the materials molecules does not destroy the liquid crystalline nature of the material or at least its ability to be aligned by liquid crystalline molecules said curvature is allowed. Similarly, branching that preserves the liquid crystalline nature of the material is also allowed. R R groups are selected from straight chain or branched achiral Ci-Cn alkyl, C1-C14 haloalkyl, C1-C14 fluoroalkyl, C2-C14 alkenyl group, optionally wherein 1 , 2, 3, 4 or 5 methylene (CH2) groups are replaced an oxygen so that no acetal, ketal, peroxide or vinyl ether is present. In other words, if more than one methylene group is replaced by an oxygen atom it will be separated from the next oxygen atom in the chain by at least three covalent bonds and no oxygen atom is connected through a single bond to a carbon-carbon double bond. In some aspects the R groups of each individual fluorene are identical. In another aspect the R groups on every fluorene in the chain are identical. In a preferred aspect the R groups of each FL moiety are identical and are selected from the group consisting of straight chain or branched achiral C2-C10 alkyl, C2-C10 haloalkyl, C2-C10 fluoroalkyl, C2-C10 alkenyl group, optionally wherein 1 , 2, or 3 CH2 groups are replaced an oxygen provided that no acetal, ketal or peroxide is present. In a preferred aspect each hydrogen atom of each R group may be independently substituted by a fluorine atom. When an R group contains at least one fluorine substituent it can be referred to as a fluoroalkyl group. In a preferred aspect the fluoroalkyl group comprises at least one hydrogen atom. Haloalkyl groups include groups substituted by Fl, CI, Br and I. Preferred haloalkyl groups are fluoroalkyl, chloroalkyl and fluorochloroalkyl groups. In a preferred aspect the R group is an alkenyl group. Alkenyl groups contain a carbon-carbon double bond. Preferred alkenyl groups contain only one carbon carbon double bond. In a preferred aspect, where the R group is an alkenyl group it is a terminal carbon-carbon double bond. In a preferred aspect the terminal alkene is of the formula -CH=CH2. As stated above, in some cases one or two or three or four or five methylene groups in the R group may be substituted for an oxygen atom. When this is the case the R group is an ether or polyether. The methylene group is a CH2 group. When two or more methylene groups are replaced by an oxygen atom there are at least two carbon atoms in the chain between them. This is because peroxide, ketal, acetal and vinyl ether units are potentially unstable and are therefore not included in the structure of the compounds of the invention. Variation of the length of the R group is useful because the melting point of the compound can be modulated. For example, when liquid crystalline compounds are required it can be advantageous to use R groups with from 2 to 14 carbon and oxygen atoms in the chain because d-hydrocarbyl derivatives often exhibit elevated melting points. In preferred aspects the R groups contain between 2 and 10 carbon and oxygen atoms in the chain. Introduction of oxygen atoms into the R group can advantageously be used to modulate the temperature at which the compound undergoes its glass transition and this can be an advantage for applications when glassy materials are required. Introduction of a carbon-carbon double can be advantageously used to reduce the viscosity of the material and this is especially interesting for compounds that are to be solution processed. Introduction of a carbon-carbon double bond at the chain terminus is especially advantageous for modulation of the viscosity of the material. For application in electronic devices high purity material is required and the presence of any asymmetric centres in the hydrocarbyl group is disfavoured. For this reason, in the compounds of the invention wherein the R group is branched, the branching does not introduce a chiral centre. This achiral branching advantageously circumvents problems with purification that can be associated with diastereoisomeric mixtures of chemicals. Introduction of branching in the group R can advantageously be used to modulate the melting point of the compounds of the invention. Selected examples of FL structure with the R group drawn out in full are presented below. x = 1 to 4 x = 0 to 5 Compounds of the structure are preferred intermediates for the synthesis of compounds containing these fluoroalkyl fluorene derivative emitter cores due to their synthetic utility. Ar1 and Ar2 Ar1 and Ar2 in each occurrence are independently selected from the group comprising Ar3 and a bond. Ar3 represents a diradical comprising 1 aromatic, heteroaromatic or FL moiety, or 2, 3, 4 or 5 aromatic, heteroaromatic and/or FL moieties mutually connected by single bonds. Diradicals are groups that are covalently bound to two other moieties within the overall structure of the compound, some typical examples are presented below, * denotes the typical site of attachment. The precise nature of the Ar3 groups selected is dependent on the properties desired in the system. For example, if a light emitting compound is required two, three, four, five or six contiguous FL groups may feature in the structure. Alternatively, a high proportion of Ar3 groups, for example 50% or more, may be FL groups. The constituent aromatic and heteroaromatic group comprised by Ar3 can be selected from the group of C6-C16 aromatic group and C4-C12 heteroaromatics that are optionally substituted. The optional substituents may be selected from the group of C1-C10 alkyl or ether groups which are optionally achirally branched. Aromatic diradicals that are useful as Ar3 structural units in the materials of the invention include, but are not limited to, 1 ,4-phenylene, biphenyl-4,4'-diyl, terphenyl-4,4"-diyl, naphthalene-1 ,4-diyl, naphthalene-2,6-diyl, thiophene-2,5-diyl, pyrimidine-2,5-diyl, pyridine- 2.5- diyl, perylene-3,10-diyl, pyrene-2,7-diyl, 2,2'-dithiophene-5,5'-diyl, oxazole-2,5-diyl, 1 ,3,4- oxadiazole-2,5-diyl, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2,5-diyl, dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]thiophene-2,6-diyl, dibenzothiophene-3,7-diyl, benzo[1 ,2-b:4,5-b']bis[1]benzothiophene-3,9-diyl, thiazolo[5,4- d]thiazole-2,5-diyl, oxazolo[5,4-d]oxazole-2,5-diyl, thiazolo[5,4-d]oxazole-2,5-diyl, thiazolo[4,5-d]thiazole-2,5-diyl, oxazolo[4,5-d]oxazole-2,5-diyl, thiazolo[4,5-d]oxazole-2,5- diyl, 2,1 ,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl, 4-thien-2-yl-2,1 ,3-benzothiazole-7,5'-diyl, 4,7-dithien-2- yl-2,1 ,3-benzothiazole-5',5"-diyl, imidazo[4,5-d]imidazole-2,5-diyl, 4-alkyl-1 ,2,4-triazole-3,5- diyl, 4-aryl-1 ,2,4-triazole-3,5-diyl, 4-phenyl-1 ,2,4-triazole-3,5-diyl, 4-(p-tertbutylphenyl)-1 ,2,4- triazole-3,5-diyl, di-1 ,2,4-triazolo[4,5-f:4,5-q]-5,6, 12,13-tetrahydro-5,12- diazadibenz[a,h]anthracene-5,13-diyl, 9-alkylcarbazole-2,7-diyl, 6, 12-dialkylindolo[2,3- b]carbazole-2,8-diyl, benzo[1 ,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl, benzo[1 ,2-b:5,4-b']dithiophene- 2.6- diyl, [1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene-2,7-diyl, benzo[1 ,2-d:4,5-d']bisoxazole-2,6- diyl, benzo[1 ,2-d:5,4-d']bisoxazole-2,6-diyl, 5,5-dioxodibenzothiophene-3,7-diyl, or 6, 12- dialkyl-5,5-11 , 11-tetraoxobenzo[1 ,2-b:4,5-b']bis[1]benzothiophene-3,9-diyl diradicals, If hole transporting properties are desired then indole and thiophene containing moieties such as those presented below may be preferred, * denotes the typical site of attachment. If electron transporting properties are desired then oxazole containing moieties such as those presented below may be preferred, * denotes the typical site of attachment. In a preferred aspect the compound is an emitter material and n is from 1 to 6. In a further preferred aspect n is 3 to 6. In a preferred aspect n is 5 or 6. In a preferred aspect n is 5. In a further preferred aspect n is 6. Longer molecules are preferred because device energy efficiency increases with increasing length of the aromatic core of the molecule. There is evidence from luminescence decay time measurements that the increase in energy efficiency is due to triplet-triplet exciton annihilation that occurs in the longer molecular cores, but is less likely to occur in shorter molecular cores. Further small increases in energy efficiency can be achieved by lengthening the molecular cores even further to n = 7 or 8, but increases in efficiency has to be balanced with the increased cost of synthesising such molecules. A further preferred aspect of the invention is that emitter materials of the invention comprise molecular core structures, A, are terminated with FL units. In charge transporting or host material molecules the termination of the molecular cores with Ar units such as biphenyl-4,4'- diyl can be advantageous because the liquid crystalline properties of the materials can be enhanced and charge carrier transport can be enhanced by strong intermolecular interactions mediated by π - π interactions between the terminal Ar groups. However, in the case of emitter materials, these same interactions can lead to quenching of the exciton energy and terminal FL groups with relative bulky substituents at the 9-positions are therefore preferred. Flexible linker groups S\ S1a, S2 and S When D represents a cross linkable group the compounds of the invention contain two flexible linker groups S1 and S2. As discussed herein, D can also represent a more complex structure containing additional flexible linker groups S1a and S2a that are analogous to the S1 and S2 groups. In each occurrence S\ S1a, S2 and S2a are independently selected from straight chain or branched achiral Cs-Cn alkyl groups, optionally wherein 1 , 2, 3, 4 or 5 methylene groups are substituted for an oxygen atom, provided that R contains no peroxide, ketal or acetal groups, that is connected to A through either a bond or an ether, ester, carbonate, thioether, amine or amide linkage and that is connected through either a bond or an ether, ester, carbonate, thioether, amine or amide linkage to D, B1 , B2, B3 or S3 as determined by the nature of D. The flexible linker groups S\ S1a, S2 and S2a serve to separate the fluorophore system within A from the cross linkable groups. When the material is cross linked into a network polymer matrix, the flexible linker mechanically and electronically isolates the fluorophore from the polymeric matrix. Thus when the material is cross linked into a polymer matrix, the flexible linker serves to reduce non-emissive exciton quenching thereby favouring efficient light emission. D, B\ B2 and B3 D represents a cross linkable group or, when B1 represents a hydrogen, D represents -B2-S3- B3-S1a-A-S2a-B1a, -S3(B2)-B3-S1a-A-S2a-B1a, -S3(B2)(B3)-S1a-A-S2a-B1a, -S3(B2)(B3) or a cross linkable group wherein the dash at the left-hand end of the chain represents the point of attachment to S1. B1 , B2 and B3 each independently represent a cross linking group or a hydrogen. The compounds of the invention therefore comprises cross linking group and form, when cross linked, network polymers. This is because preferred cross linking groups react with two other cross linking groups to yield a chain reaction and a polymer matrix. In a preferred aspect, cross linking groups are selected from the group of ethylenic, diene, thiol and oxetane cross linkable groups. Ethylenic cross linkable groups are cross linkable groups containing a carbon-carbon double bond.

In Type 3 S3 spacer groups it is preferred that the cross linking groups B2 and B3 are connected to C3-C12 alkyl groups, optionally C4-C10 alkyl groups, because this configuration provides greater structural flexibility and facilitates eventual cross linking reaction of B2 and B3 with the cross linking groups present in adjacent molecules. This affords the potential for cross linking under mild conditions and minimises and possible degradation. In a preferred example, the Type 3 S3 spacer group comprises four C2-C12 alkyl groups connected to a central C6-C16 aryl group by either a bond, an ether linkage or an ester linkage.

Further examples of structures D of the materials of the invention are provided below for illustration. Branching in the R group can be used to modulate the melting point of the material. Material properties The materials of the present invention are particularly useful for both their charge transport and light emitting properties. As such the materials described herein are useful in the fabrication of electronic devices, for example organic light emitting diodes and photovoltaic devices. One advantageous property of the oligomeric materials of the present invention is that they are soluble in common organic solvents. This is significant as the solubility properties of the oligomers provides a distinct advantage in terms of device fabrication relative to e.g. polymeric materials. In more detail, these oligomeric material may be used to fabricate devices via a solution processing approach. In outline, this involves first dissolving the material, applying this solution to a substrate and then evaporating to generate a film coating on the substrate. Once the material is deposited as a film the material can be polymerised in situ. This polymerisation may be initiated by exposure to radiation, for instance ultraviolet light, which causes the cross linkable groups of one molecule to cross link with those in an adjacent molecule to form a network polymer. Regions of the deposited film can be masked from the initiating radiation to give zones of non cross-linked material while zones exposed to radiation undergo polymerisation. If desired the unexposed, non-cross linked material can be washed off to leave behind a patterned structure of cross linked material due to the cross linked material having negligible or reduced solubility relative to that of the monomer. Iterative cycles of solution deposition and polymerisation can be used to generate structures with complex architectures. Sequentially deposited polymerised structures can be assembled in a side by side or stacked/layered manner. In one example, sequential deposition and polymerisation of red, green and blue emitting material in a side by side manner can be used to generate pixels for colour displays. In another example, a stack of red, green and blue emitter materials can be used to give a white light source. In another example, two or more emitter structures can be arranged in a stack to give a coloured light source. The ability to cheaply and economically produce multilayer devices in which adjoining layers have different highest occupied or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO and LUMO) energy levels as well as different charge carrier mobilities is of general utility in plastic electronics. For instance, the equivalent of p-n junctions may be formed using the materials and processes of this invention and these may find utility in diodes, transistors, and photovoltaic devices. The propensity of the materials of the invention to be photo lithographically patterned allows large arrays of plastic electronic devices of virtually any size and description to be fabricated. Materials according to this invention may be mixed together to form liquid crystalline mixtures. This can be very advantageous from the standpoint of optimising the material properties for the intended application. For instance, individual compounds of the invention may have liquid crystal to isotropic liquid transition temperature far below their melting points (monotropic liquid crystalline phases). In device fabrication applications this can lead to glassy or supercooled liquid films of the materials that are sufficiently thermodynamically unstable so as to lead to the danger of crystallisation within the film and subsequent destruction of useful electronic properties. Mixing multiple component compounds together can depress the melting point of the resulting mixtures below the liquid crystal to isotropic liquid transition temperatures or at least sufficiently suppress crystallisation so as to eliminate this problem. Another advantage associated with using mixtures of the materials of the invention is that it may allow materials with otherwise highly useful device application properties to be used even though they a have a particular property that renders them unusable as a pure material. For instance it may be desired to prepare a light emitting polymer film having a nematic liquid crystalline structure. A compound of the invention may be a light emitting material of very high efficiency and possess other useful properties, but at the same time may be found to possess a smectic rather than a nematic liquid crystalline phase. By dissolving said desirable compound into a mixture of other compounds of the invention that have nematic phases, a mixture having the light emission properties of the first highly desirable material combined with a nematic phase structure may result. A further advantage associated with using liquid crystalline materials or mixtures of material is that directional organised or anisotropic structures can be formed. This directional order can be fixed in place by cross linking the components of the deposited films, for example by exposing the deposited film to radiation such as ultraviolet light. In one preferred instance, a liquid crystalline film can be deposited onto a substrate that is coated with an alignment layer such as a photoalignment layer. The components of a photoalignment layer form directionally ordered structures on exposure to light. This directional order in the alignment layer can then transfer into the deposited liquid crystalline film formed on its surface leading to a highly ordered device structure which can be locked in place by polymerising the component oligomer by exposing the deposited ordered film to radiation such as ultraviolet light. The potential to obtain highly ordered device structures can be exploited to generate polarised light emitting structures in which the emitter cores are aligned in the same direction and therefore emit light in the same direction. Ultimately, the properties of the materials described herein afford the possibility to fabricate 3D-displays through sequential deposition of aligned layers of uniformly aligned liquid crystalline fluid or glass, sequential polymerisation of patterned areas of each layer in turn, and sequentially washing away unpolymerised areas of each layer in turn so as to provide light emitting structures such that the liquid crystalline alignment and thus the polarisation axis of light emission of each respective layer is in a different direction. The materials of the present invention also possess a number of additional desirable properties that render them useful for the production of electronic devices such as OLEDs. In organic light emitting devices it is often also desirable to reduce the self-absorption of emitted light by organic luminescent materials. This self-absorption occurs because the spectral absorbance and emission bands of organic luminescent materials overlap to a greater or lesser extent in various materials. A solution to this problem well known, for instance, in the field of dye lasers is to dissolve the luminescent material in a host with that absorbs light at a shorter wavelength than the luminescent solute. If the solution is dilute, for instance one to two percent, the self-absorption of the luminescent solute is nearly completely suppressed. The facile mutual miscibility of the various compounds of this invention makes the preparation of solutions of this type very easy. The materials of the present invention therefore are useful as host materials as well as light emitting materials. In organic light emitting device applications it is necessary that there be facile excitation energy transfer from the host material to the solute luminescent material. This is because charge carriers (electrons and holes) must be transported through the host medium to recombine to form the excitons (electrically excited molecular orbital states) that radiate light. In a mixture composed mainly of component host molecules this recombination and exciton formation will mainly occur in the host molecules. The excitation energy then needs to be transferred from the host molecules into the luminescent solute molecules. It is a requirement for this energy transfer that the spectral luminescent emission band(s) of the host material overlap the absorption band of the luminescent solute. Thus an important aspect of the invention is the preparation of mixtures of the compounds of the invention that have this spectral relationship between the constituent components. For instance, a compound which emits in the blue region of the spectrum can serve as a host for a compound which is a green light emitter. A polymer film prepared by the UV induced crosslinking of a solution of 5% blue emitter compound in green emitter compound will exhibit considerably less self-absorption of the green light emitted by the green emitter than will a film prepared by UV crosslinking of pure green emitter. To demonstrate the utility of the material of the invention exemplary blue and green emitters ("Lomox Blue" and "Lomox Green" as presented below) were incorporated into simple unoptimised OLED devices without crosslinking. In these devices the emissive layer consists of one of the selected fluoroalkyl fluorene based emitters doped into polyvinyl carbazole) (PVK), a standard host material. The overall structure of the devices was ITO (125 nm) / PEDOT:PSS (50 nm) / PVK:Emitter (70 nm) / TPBI (30 nm) / LiF (1 nm) / Al (100 nm). PEDOT:PSS is a standard hole injection material, and TPBI is a standard electron transport material. Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) was used as the anode, while the cathode consists of lithium fluoride and aluminium. PEDOT:PSS and emissive layers were deposited on a pre-patterned glass/ITO substrate by spin coating, while the TPBI electron transport layer and cathode layers were subsequently deposited by thermal evaporation. Lomox Blue Standard Blue Current voltage and luminance data for these devices are shown in Figure 2 which shows in the first graph: J- V (left) and in the second L-V (right) data of devices incorporating the emitters of the present invention as dopants in a PVK host. For a device of the present invention with a blue emitter shown here, the doping ratio was 100:5 PVK:Emitter, while for the green device the ratio was 100: 15. Devices incorporating the blue emitter reached a peak luminance of 165 cd nr2 at a voltage of 15 V, while for the green emitter the peak luminance was 700 cd nr2 at a voltage of 14 V. Additionally, devices using the blue emitter as a host material for the green emitter have been fabricated, demonstrating that this material can be used as a host as well. This device incorporated a layer of PVK as a hole transport/electron blocking interlayer, for an overall device structure of ITO (125 nm) / PEDOT:PSS (50 nm) / PVK (30 nm) / Lomox Blue:Lomox Green (50 nm) / TPBI (30 nm) / LiF (1 nm) / Al (100 nm). The ratio of Lomox blue host to Lomox green emitter in the device shown was 85: 15. Current voltage and luminance data for this device are shown in Figure 3. The peak luminance attained for this device was 595 cd nr2 at a voltage of 14.5 V. The electroluminescence spectrum of this device is shown in Figure 4, showing predominantly green emission from the dopant emitter while a weaker peak of blue emission from the host material can be seen between 350 and 450 nm. Yet another advantage of using mixtures of the materials of the invention is that it allows the use of mixtures of reactive mesogen materials in which photoinitiated electron donor/acceptor interactions as opposed to ionic or free radical initiation are used to initiate polymerization. This may result in much more stable (in terms of shelf-life) reactive mesogen materials than in methacrylate-based systems, while at the same time maintaining low UV crosslinking fluences. In these mixtures at least one of the reactive mesogen materials is substituted with electron-rich crosslinking groups while at least one other component reactive mesogen material is substituted with electron-deficient crosslinking groups. Ultraviolet radiation incident on the material promotes the electron deficient crosslinking groups on some reactive mesogen molecules into electronically excited states. The excited state, electron-deficient crosslinking groups then abstract electrons from the electron-rich (electron donor) crosslinking groups on other reactive mesogen molecules initiating the copolymerization crosslinking reaction. Descriptions of this mode of photopolymerization may be found in, for example, "Photoinitiated radical polymerization of vinyl ether-maleate systems", Polymer 38, (9) pp. 2229-37 (1997); and "Co-Polymerization of Maleimides and Vinyl Ethers: A Structural Study", Macromolecules 1998, (31) pp. 5681-89. Electron-deficient crosslinking groups include maleimides, maleates, fumarates, and other unsaturated esters. Electron donor groups include vinyl ethers, propenyl ethers and other similar alkenyl ethers. Mixtures like these are advantageous in that the individual components are thermally and photochemically stable with excellent shelf lives. However, when the materials are combined, the mixture has high photochemical sensitivity and requires only a relatively small UV dose for crosslinking. Crosslinkable materials according to the present invention have been used as the emissive layer in OLED devices. Measurements of the devices demonstrate that the light emitted originates from the crosslinked Lomox layer. The structure of the devices was ITO (150 nm) / PEDOT:PSS (50 nm) / PVK (30 nm) / Lomox emitter materials (65 nm unrinsed) / TPBI (30 nm) / LiF (1 nm) / Al (70 nm). Two devices (each of 4 pixels of area 4 x 4 mm) were fabricated with this architecture. The emitter layer consisted of a blue host doped with a green emitter in the ratio blue:green 90:10. This final ratio was achieved with a mixture of (A, compound 43) blue fluorophore with maleimide crosslinker unit and (B, compound 41) blue fluorophore with vinyl ether crosslinker unit as the host material, doped with (C, compound 58) green fluorophore with vinyl ether crosslinkers blended in the ratio 50:40:10 A: B:C. The solution processable PEDOT:PSS, PVK and emitter layers were deposited on a pre- patterned glass/ITO substrate by spin coating. Spin coating the Lomox emitter materials from 20 mg/ml toluene solution at 2500 rpm for 60 seconds results in good quality uniform films with a thickness of 65 nm. After spin coating, the emitter layer was exposed to a metal halide lamp with broad emission from 280 - 450 nm (Dymax BlueWave 200) at a power density of 5 W/cm2 for 15 seconds in an argon atmosphere to crosslink the material. This broad spectrum light source covers the 350 - 380 nm range of excitation wavelengths at which the crosslinking process was found to be fastest for the Lomox materials used in these devices. After crosslinking, one device was spin rinsed with toluene in order to remove any uncrosslinked material, and one device was left unrinsed for comparison. The TPBI electron transport layer and cathode layers were subsequently deposited by thermal evaporation. Current voltage and luminance data for these simple unoptimised devices are shown in Figure 5. The device with a crosslinked and rinsed layer has a turn on voltage of 7.5 V, above which the device emits with a luminance in excess of 10 cd/m2, and reaches a peak luminance of 804 cd/m2 at 16.5 V. This demonstrates that crosslinking of these materials results in an insoluble, emissive film suitable for application in OLED devices. The current and brightness are higher for the rinsed devices as the rinsed layer is thinner. Electroluminescence spectra from these devices are shown in Figure 6, along with the photoluminescence spectrum of the green material doped in the blue host in a crosslinked thin film. These spectra clearly show that the emission is green, and is therefore arising from the green Lomox emitter in the emissive layer. The spectral shift in emission on rinsing is likely to be an optical effect as the rinsed layer is thinner. The stability of the 9,9'-(tetrafluoroalkyl) substituted fluorene emitter core relative to the corresponding 9,9 -alkyl fluorene core was evaluated by exposing a solution of each compound ("Lomox Blue" and "Standard Blue" as presented above) to irradiation with a 150 W xenon light source and measuring the reduction of fluorescence intensity over time. The results of this study (Figures 7 and 8) showed that the half life of the 9,9'-(tetrafluoroalkyl) substituted fluorene emitter was approximately 5 times longer than that of the corresponding 9,9'-alkyl fluorene. It is thus evident that the 9,9'-(tetrafluoroalkyl) substitution provides enhanced stability. Further studies established that the absorption and emission properties of the 9,9'- (tetrafluoroalkyl) substituted fluorene emitter core and the corresponding 9,9'-alkyl fluorene core were similar and that the fluoro-alkyl chains at the fluorene 9-position do not have a detrimental effect on the fluorescence efficiency of the respective fluorophore in solution. The fluorescence quantum yield (0F) is the ratio of photons absorbed to photons emitted through fluorescence. It reflects the probability of the excited state being deactivated by fluorescence rather than a non-radiative mechanism. In general, the higher the 0F the better, as it results in a more efficient OLED device. It is thought that short fluorescence lifetimes may be more desirable for OLEDs due to the shorter time period that the molecule stays in the excited state and, thus, less chance of the molecule undergoing unwanted non-radiative decay and a decrease in fluorescence efficiency. The Lomox Blue compound proved to have a fluorescence lifetime in toluene solution of 15 ns which is significantly shorter than that observed for the Standard Blue that displayed a fluorescence lifetime in toluene solution of 75 ns suggesting the fluoroalkyl fluorene systems have further advantages in this respect.

Synthetic Examples The compounds of the present invention may be synthesised by common techniques in organic synthesis well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Illustrative examples of how these compounds can be synthesised are presented below. As can be appreciated, the nature of these materials allows a modular approach to synthesis to be adopted and the fluoroalkyl fluorene core can be integrated into a range of materials by standard chemical techniques. In this manner the nature of all components of materials, for example the core A, the various flexible linker / spacer groups (S\ S1a, S2, S2a and S3) and the various cross linkers and cross linker containing structures (D, B1 , B2 and B3) can be readily adjusted to fine tune properties of the bulk materials such as melting point, liquid crystallinity and light emissive properties. The examples provided below are by way of example only and in no way limit the scope of the invention. Scheme 1 Synthesis of 9,9-difluoroalkylfluorene-2,7-biphenyl derivatives Octafluorinated ketone 1 Methyllithium lithium bromide complex (6.6 ml_, 9.9 mmol, 1.5 mM in diethyl ether) was added dropwise over 10 min to a stirred solution of diethyl carbonate (1.0 ml_, 8.3 mmol) and 1- bromo-1 , 1 ,2,2-tetrafluorooctane (3.2 ml_, 20.5 mmol) in dry diethyl ether (150 ml_) under argon at -78 °C.
