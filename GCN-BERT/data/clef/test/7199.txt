Synthesis of compound I-0033
Step 1
Dimethylsulfuric acid (106 mL, 1.11 mmol) was added dropwise to a 10% aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide (651 mL) of the compound 46 (150 g, 1.06 mmol) at 3째C to 5째C. The mixture was stirred at 0째C to 5째C for 4 hours. The precipitates were filtered, and washed by IPE. The obtained solids were dried under reduced pressure to give the compound 47 (106.5 g, yield 65%).
