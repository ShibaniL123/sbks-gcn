Step 3: [5-(d3)methylpyridin-2-yl](d)formaldehyde
To a solution of [5-(d3)methylpyridin-2-yl](d2)methanol [Example 6, Step 2] (800 mg, 6.25 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in chloroform (10 mL) was added MnO2 (7.07 g, 81.25 mmol, 13.00 equiv). The mixture was stirred overnight at 50Â° C. The solids were filtered out. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to afford 200 mg (25%) of [5-(d3)methylpyridin-2-yl](d)formaldehyde as brown oil.
