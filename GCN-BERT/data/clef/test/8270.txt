METHODS OF IMPROVING TOLERABILITY, PHARMACODYNAMICS, AND EFFICACY OF p-ALANINE AND USE THEREFOR RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/757,604, filed on January 28, 2013. The entire teachings of the above application are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It has been suggested that the anaerobic working capacity of tissues can be increased by ingesting either p-alanine, or a mixture of p-alanine and creatine (Harris and Dunnett, 1997; Stellingwerff et al., 2007). By increasing concentrations of p-alanine, the hope is to increase the biosynthesis of p-alanyl-L-histidine (carnosine) dipeptides, subsequently increasing the accumulation of carnosine in the body's tissues (Derave et al., 2007; Harris et al. 2007; Hill et al. , 2007; Stout et al., 2007) . Based on this supposition, p-alanine is sometimes included in pre-workout or post-workout dietary supplements or multivitamin preparations, especially those targeted at consumers who wish to improve muscular performance for training or competition, decrease fatigue, augment muscle bulk or strength, and enhance adaptations to exercise. However, when taken orally for improving exercise performance and capacity, p-alanine may cause sensory paraesthesia when ingested in amounts above 10 mg/kg body weight. These "pins and needles" and/or "intense itching" sensations are relatively mild at 10 mg/kg, but become severe at oral doses of 40 mg/kg (Harris, R.C.; Tallon, M.J.; Dunnett, Μ.; Boobis, L.; Coakley, J.; Kim, H.J.; Fallowfield, J.L.; Hill, C.A.; Sale, C.; Wise, J.A. The absorption of orally supplied β-alanine and its effect on muscle carnosine synthesis in human vastus lateralis. Amino Acids 2006, 30, 279-289). At such doses, paraesthesia becomes a significant impediment to the use of p-alanine to improve physical performance. As a result of the dosage limitations, p-alanine is typically administered at lower doses (e.g., 800 mg - 1600 mg) two to four times daily for 4-6 weeks before peak effect on physical performance is observed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Aspects of the present invention generally relate to compositions and methods for improving the tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of β-η1ηη,1η℮, for example, by reducing discomfort due to parasthesia (e.g., sensations of burning, itching, flushing, pins and needles, and/or tingling, etc.) associated with administration of p-alanine alone. The improvements derive generally from the ability to administer larger doses of /-alanine and/or administer doses of /-alanine over a shorter period of time. In some aspects the present invention relates to compositions (e.g., nutritional compositions, pharmaceutical compositions, etc.), formulations, and food or beverage products (e.g., a functional food, medical food or functional beverage) comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of (a) /-alanine and/or a derivative of β-alanine, and (b) at least one agent that modulates the N-methyl D-aspartate (WMDA) pathway. In some aspects the present invention relates to compositions (e.g., nutritional compositions, pharmaceutical compositions, etc.), formulations, and food or beverage products (e.g., a functional food, medical food or functional beverage) comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of (a) /-alanine and/or a derivative of /-alanine, and (b) at least one agent that modulates the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) pathway or a biological pathway that converges downstream with the NMDA pathway. An exemplary composition, formulation, or food or beverage product comprises /-alanine and L-theanine (e.g., in admixture). Another exemplary composition, formulation, or food or beverage product comprises β-alanine, Ziziphus jujube car. Spinosa extract, and L~ theanine (e.g., in admixture). As used herein, the term "active agents" refers to any of the compounds disclosed herein as component (a) and/or component (b). It is also to be understood that the "active agents" comprising component (a) and component (b) may be chemically linked together, for examp 1 e via a covalent bond (e.g., in the form of a dipeptide comprising (a) and (b), e.g., p-alanyl-Ltheanine) or an ionic bond (e.g., in the form of a salt comprising (a) and (b), e.g., p-alanine-L-theanate) that is broken upon administration of the composition, formulation, or food or beverage product to a human or animal in such a way that both (a) and (b) impart a therapeutic effect to the human or animal. The compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention are useful for enhancing physical performance in a human or animal and confer advantages over administering β-alanine alone. For example, the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention are useful for reducing the paraesthesia associated with administration of p-alanine alone (e.g., to a tolerable level). ■Specifically, the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention permit administration of a dose of β-alanine without eliciting the moderate-to-severe paraesthesia (e.g., intolerable paraesthesia) induced by a corresponding dose of β-alanine administered alone or by other art-accepted methods. Accordingly, the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention improve tolerance and compliance to higher doses of β-alanine (or a derivative of β-℮1ηη1η℮) thereby permitting administration of higher doses of p-alanine when compared to β-η1ηη1η℮ administered alone or by other art-accepted methods and formulations. For example, surprisingly and unexpectedly, the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention can provide as much as about 15 grams of β-alanine in a single dose, and as many as three single 15 gram doses of β-alanine can be consumed daily without eliciting intolerable paraesthesia. Preferably, the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention provide between about 6 to 10 grams of β-alanine in a single dose that can be consumed as much as three times daily. When consumed in this manner, the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention surprisingly and unexpectedly improve tolerance and compliance to higher doses of β-℮1ηη1η℮, thereby reducing the length of time required to achieve effect (e.g., peak effect) of β-alanine on physical performance by up to 85% (e.g., from about 4-6 weeks to about 4-6 days) of the supplementation time period required to achieve efficacy when β-℮1ηη1η℮ is dosed at 40 mg/kg bodyweight in a human or animal. In some embodiments, the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention reduce the length of time require to achieve effect (e.g., peak effect) of β-η1ηη1η℮ on physical performance by between 10% to 85% (e.g., from about 4-6 weeks to about 4-21 days) of the supplementation time period required to achieve efficacy when β-η1ηη1η℮ is dosed at 40 mg/kg bodyweight in a human or animal. The compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention can provide improved nutritional and/or therapeutic efficacy as compared to their individual effects. The invention also relates to administration of the composition, formulation, or food or beverage product to a human or animal in a method for enhancing physical performance/function in the human or animal and/or in a method for reducing intolerable p-alanine-induced paraesthesia in the human or animal to a tolerable level. It is to be understood that reduction of intolerable β-alanine-induced paraesthesia to a tolerable level can be objectively quantified as a change in an individual's anchored 100mm VAS score, on a scale from 0-100mm, from 60mm~90mm (when ingesting p-alanine alone) to about a 10mm-30mm (when ingesting β-alanine and at least one agent that modulates the NMDA pathway). As used herein, "physical performance/function" refers to any physical attribute dependent on contraction of skeletal muscle. For example, physical function/performance includes, but is not limited to, optimal muscular strength, muscular endurance, running speed and endurance, swimming speed and endurance, throwing power, lifting and pulling power. ft-alanine p-alanine (e.g., in substantially pure form, or modified to improve a property of p-alanine such as shelf-life, half-life, stability, bioavailability, etc.) is an active agent of the present invention. As used herein, the invention also encompasses one or more compounds (e.g., isolated or synthetic) other than β-alanine that increase endogenous levels of p-alanine in a human or animal when administered to the human or animal, such as carnosine, balenine, and anserine, for example, p-alanine (CAS Registry No. 107-95-9, sometimes known as 2-Carboxyethylamine or 3-Aminopropanoic acid) is a naturally occurring beta amino acid, has a molecularweight of about 89.0933, and has the structure below. Nil.* OH β-alanine β-alanine is widely used as a dietary supplement for, inter alia, increasing muscle carnosine concentration, decreasing fatigue in athletes, reducing muscle fatigue, reducing muscle damage, promoting endurance, promoting recovery, increasing strength, and improving overall physical performance and body composition. These benefits of p-alanine are welldocumented and usually increase with dose. However, oral administration of p-alanine at doses greater than 10 mg/kg body weight can result in sensory paraesthesia. The paraesthesia is often described as being akin to a flushing vasomotor phenomenon with burning, itching, and superficial skin discomfort that may involve the head and neck, arms, back and proximal lower extremities. It can also be described as being similar to the vasomotor symptoms associated with nicotinic acid (niacin) ingestion. In some embodiments, paraesthesia is described as a subjective sensation of overall discomfort selected from the group consisting of burning, flushing, itching, pins and needles, tingling, and combinations thereof. Paraesthesia is relatively mild at about 10 mg/kg, and oral doses of 40 mg/kg or higher can result in moderate-to-severe paraesthesia. As a result of these dosage limitations, f-alanine is typically administered at lower doses, multiple times per day, for about 4-6 weeks before peak effect on physical performance is observed. In some instances, paraesthesia can be so intolerable that some individuals may choose to avoid β-alanine supplementation entirely. During the course of work described herein, it was surprisingly and unexpectedly found that the paraesthesia elicited by p-alanine can be reduced (e.g., to a tolerable level) by co-administering to a human or animal (a) p-alanine and/or a derivative of p-alanine, and (b) at least one modulator of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) pathway or a pathway which converges downstream with the NMDA pathway. Moreover, surprisingly and unexpectedly, co-administering (a) and (b) to the human or animal allows the human or animal to consume as much as 15 grams of β^1ηη1η℮ in a single dose and to take as many as three 15 gram doses of β-α1ηη1η℮ per day without eliciting intolerable paraesthesia. Preferably, the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention provide between about 6 to 10 grams of β-alanine in a single dose, and allow as many of three such 6 to 10 gram single doses of β-alanine to be consumed per day. When consumed in this manner, peak effect of β-η1ηη1η℮ on physical performance can be achieved in as little as 4-6 days of administration, typically without eliciting intolerable paraesthesia. In some embodiments, peak effect of β-alanine on physical performance can be achieved in as little as 4-21 days of administration, typically without eliciting intolerable paraesthesia. Stated differently, co-administering (a) and (b) achieves a peak effect of β-alanine on physical performance in as little as between approximately 10% to 15% of the time it takes to elicit peak effect when p-alanine is administered in a conventional manner, and increases the extent or magnitude of effect as a result of increasing intramuscular carnosine concentration, which has been deemed to be related to total beta-Alanine dose consumed over the supplementation period. Accordingly, the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention improve tolerance and compliance to higher doses of β-alanine, thereby permitting usage of higher doses of β-alanine when compared to p-alanine administered alone or in art-recognized formulations or compositions. In some instances, depending on the actual dosage of β-alanine consumed by a human or animal, paraesthesia in the human or animal may be prevented or reduced entirely. The objective of the present invention, however, is to reduce intolerable paraesthesia to a tolerable level so that the human or animal can consume higher doses of β-alanine to reduce the length of time it takes to achieve peak effect, and increase the magnitude or extent of the effect of β-℮1ηη1η℮ on physical performance, and to do so in a way that the individual or animal can still feel that the p-alanine is working. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that complete prevention or reduction of β-alanine-induced paraesthesia in a human or animal could cause the human or animal to feel that the p-alanine-is not working properly, which could also interfere with compliance. Of course, it should be appreciated that the present invention contemplates the usage of any dosage of β-alanine that may be commercially desirable. For example, a single dose of p-alanine in a. composition, formulation, or food or beverage product of the present invention can be about 1.6 grams, and such dose can be consumed several times per day or per administration or more. In some instances, a composition, formulation, or food or beverage product of the present invention provides β-alanine in a single dose of 3.2 grams, and such dose can be consumed several times per day or more. Derivatives of β-α1ηη1η℮ A derivative of (3-alanine can be used as an active agent of the present invention. As used herein, "derivative of p-alanine" refers to a compound that, when delivered to the human or animal body, imparts the same or similar physiological effects as p-alanine on muscle and other tissues. An exemplary derivative of β-alanine that can be used as an active agent in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention is N-acetyl-p-alanine (CAS Registry No. 3025-95-4) . Other exemplary derivatives of β-alanine that can be used as active agents in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention include the fluorinated methyl β-℮1ηη1η℮ derivatives, for example 3-amino-3-fluoromethylpropionic acid, disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,375,477, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Additional exemplary derivatives of β-α1αη1η℮ that can be used as active agents in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention also include β-alanine esters or amides, for example the carboxylic acid salts of β-alanine esters or amides disclosed in European Patent Publication No. ΕΡ1734034, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other exemplary derivatives of β-alanine that can be used as active agents in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention include salts of β-η1ηη1η℮, for example organic salts of β-alanine disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 7,956,218, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Another exemplary derivative of p-alanine that can be used as an active agent in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention is p-alanine nitrate. Derivatives of β-alanine that can be used as active agents in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention are not intended to be limited to the specifically mentioned derivatives, and other derivatives will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Agent that modulates the NMDA pathway As used herein, "NMDA pathway" refers to the biological pathway and associated physiological effects triggered by direct or indirect modulation of the Νmethyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The NMDA receptor is a subclass of glutamate receptors; glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter of the mammalian central nervous system. The NMDA receptor plays a role in synaptic plasticity underlying cognitive functions, for example memory and learning, and in nociceptive pathways. The present invention contemplates the use of any agent that modulates (partially or completely) NMDA pathway activity regardless of its chemical composition or mechanism of action, including agents that modulate a biological pathway that converges downstream with the NMDA pathway. Stated differently, the term "NMDA pathway" encompasses any biological pathway that converges downstream with the NMDA pathway. FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of signaling pathways that converge downstream on transcription factor CREB (see, e.g., Lonze and Ginty, "Function and regulation of CREB family transcription factors in the nervous system", Neuron. 2002; 35(4) : 605-23), which is incorporated herein by reference). As is shown in FIG. 1, one example of a biological pathway that converges downstream with the NMDA pathway is the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathway. The Mrgpr family of GPCR receptors expressed in neurons (e.g., sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia) have been reported to be involved in eliciting skin paresthesia (e.g., itch and tingling) in humans (see, e.g., Liu, et al., "Mechanisms of itch evoked by β-alanine," J Neurosci. 2012; 32 (42) : 14532-14537; and Shinohara, et al., "Identification of a G Protein-coupled Receptor Specifically Responsive to p-alanine," J Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (22) : 23559-23564, both of which are incorporated herein by reference). Accordingly, without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the Mrgpr family of GPCR receptors are a biological pathway that converges downstream with the NMDA pathway, e.g., in sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia. Exemplary such Mrgpr receptors include, but are not limited to, the MrgprD receptor and the MrgprXl receptor. Other biological pathways that converge downstream with the NMDA pathway are depicted in FIG 1. L-theanine An exemplary agent that modulates the NMDA pathway that can be used as an active agent in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention is L-theanine. L-theanine is typically used with the intention of increasing sense of calm and relaxation, without interfering with other aspects of cognitive function such as concentration and attention. There is no known public record of L-theanine being considered in combination with β-alanine to improve the functional characteristics of β-alanine or to improve tolerance and compliance with β-alanine consumption. L-theanine (CAS Registry No. 3081-61-6, also referred to as N-ethyl-L-glutamine or L-glutamic acid- γ -monoethylamide) is a glutamic acid derivative present in tea leaves, has a molecular weight of about 174.20, and has the structure shown below. L-theanine can be used as an active agent in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention in any form (e.g., purified, crudely purified, extract, etc.), derived from any source 0 L-Theanine (e.g., a commercial supplier), and prepared in any manner. For example, L-theanine can be produced using methods of organic synthesis (See, e.g., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 19(7), 1301-1307 (1971); fermentation (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. Hei 5-68578 and Hei 5-328986); or modification methods thereof using an ethylamine derivative, such as ethylamine hydrochloride, in place of ethylamine; a method comprising reacting pyroglutamic acid with ethylamine hydrochloride (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 9-263573); a plant cell culture method (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 5-123166); and a method using extraction from tea-leaves, with preference given to the fermentation methods, which achieve large amounts of L-theanine at low costs. The teachings of all of these references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The term "tea-leaves" as used herein refers to leaves obtained from any tea plant that contains desirable amounts of L-theanine (e.g., green tea, oolong tea, black tea, and the like) . The present invention contemplates administering any amount of L-theanine that is effective at modulating the NMDA pathway or otherwise reducing intolerable p-alanine-induced paraesthesia to a tolerable level. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the actual amount of L-theanine to be administered in combination with β-θ1βη1η℮ or a derivative of p-alanine can vary. For example, an effective concentration of L-theanine can be a ratio of L-theanine:p-alanine ranging from about 1:5 to about 1:15. A particularly effective concentration of L-theanine can be a ratio of L-theanine: p-alanine ranging from about 1:6 to 1:8. Exemplary dosages of L-theanine can range from about 300 mg of L-theanine when used with 40mg/kg of β-alanine in an 80 kg human subject to up to about 1200 mg of L-theanine when using doses of up to 90 mg/kg of p-alanine in an 80 kg human subject. y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) An additional exemplary agent that modulates the NMDA pathway that can be used as an active agent in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention is GABA. GABA (CAS Registry No. 56-12-2, also referred to as 4-aminobutanoic acid) is a major inhibitory transmitter, has a molecular weight of about 103.12, and has the structure below. The present invention contemplates the use of any form or source of GABA that is capable of modulating the NMDA pathway in a human or animal (e.g., GABA, a GABA analog, a GABA derivative, a GABA precursor, or GABA prodrug). The present invention contemplates administering any amount of GABA that is effective at modulating the NMDA pathway or otherwise reducing intolerable p-alanine-induced paraesthesia to a tolerable level. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the actual amount of GABA to be administered may vary. Exemplary dosages of GABA to be employed in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention range from about 200 mg to about 800 mg, up to three times per day. Examples of suitable GABA analogs include, but are not limited to gabapentin, pregabalin, vigabatrin, and baclofen. Examples of additional GABA analogs that can be used as active agents in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention are disclosed in PCT International Publication Nos. WO 92/09560; WO 93/23383; WO 97/29101; WO 97/33858; WO 97/33859; WO 98/17627; WO 99/08671; WO 99/21824; WO 99/31057; WO 99/31074; WO 99/31075; WO 99/61424; WO 00/15611; WO 00/31020; WO 00/50027; and WO 02/00209, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Alternatively, a GABA derivative can be used as an active agent in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention as the at least one agent that modulates the NMDA pathway. An exemplary GABA derivative is phenibut (CAS Registry No. 1078-21-3, also known as (RS)-4-amino-3-phenyl-butryic acid, beta-phenyl- γ -aminobutryic acid, phenylGABA, fenibut, or phenybut). Other GABA derivatives and analogs that can be used as active agents in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. GABA precursors A GABA precursor can also be used as an active agent in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention. The present invention contemplates the use of any GABA precursor that is capable of increasing endogenous levels of GABA in a human or animal upon administration to the human or animal. Exemplary GABA precursors for use as active agents in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention include, inter alia, glutamate and pyridoxal phosphate (e.g., pyridoxal-5-phosphate). Exemplary dosages of pyridoxal phsophate to be employed in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention range from about 1 mg to about 100 mg. Exemplary dosages of glutamate to be employed in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention range from about 100 mg to about 4 grams. A GABA precursor for use as an active agent in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention can also be a prodrug that is capable of being metabolized in the human or animal body to GABA. For example, the prodrug Picamilon, which crosses the blood-brain barrier and is hydrolyzed into GABA and niacin, can be a suitable GABA precursor. Magnesium An additional exemplary agent that modulates the NMDA pathway that can be used as an active agent in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention is magnesium. Magnesium (CAS Registry No. 7439-95-4, referred to by the symbol Mg) is an abundant alkaline earth metal having an atomic number of 12. The present invention contemplates the use of any form of magnesium that is capable of modulating the NMDA pathway in the human or animal body. For example, a magnesium salt can be used as an active agent in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention as the at least one agent that modulates the NMDA pathway. Exemplary magnesium salts useful as active agents of the present invention include, but are not limited to magnesium hydroxide, magnesium chloride, magnesium oxide, magnesium gluconate, magnesium malate, magnesium orotate, magnesium glycinate, and magnesium citrate, magnesium bromide. Other suitable magnesium salts will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The present invention contemplates administering any amount of magnesium that is effective at modulating the NMDA pathway or otherwise reducing intolerable p-alanine-induced paraesthesia to a tolerable level. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the actual amount of magnesium to be administered may vary. Exemplary dosages of magnesium to be employed in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention can range from about 100 mg to about 350 mg. L-carnitine An additional exemplary agent that modulates the NMDA pathway that can be used as an active agent in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention is L-carnitine or a salt or derivative of L-carnitine. The present invention contemplates the use of any form of L-carnitine that is capable of modulating the NMDA pathway in a human or animal body (e.g., acetyl L-carnitine, acetyl L-carnitine derivatives, acetyl L-carnitine analogs, acetyl L-carnitine precursors), by enhancing the reuptake of glutamate and aspartate, thus preventing glutamate and aspartate binding to and activation of NMDA receptors. For example, L-carnitine can be administered as acetyl-L-carnitine, propionyl-L-carnitine, L-carnitine Ltartate, L-carnitine fumarate, aminocarnitines (e.g., GPLC and APLC). Further exemplary forms of L-carnitine that can be used as active agents in the present invention include salts of L-carnitine disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,703,042 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), including acetyl L-carnitine L-isoleucinate hydrochloride, acetyl L-carnitine L-cysteinate hydrochloride, acetyl L-carnitine L-arginate dihydrochloride, acetyl L-carnitine L-glutamninate hydrochloride, acetyl L-carnitine L-asparaginate hydrochloride, acetyl L-carnitine glycinate hydrochloride, acetyl L-carnitine L-alaninate hydrochloride, acetyl L-carnitine L-threoninate hydrochloride, acetyl L-carnitine L-serinate hydrochloride, and acetyl L-carnitine L-typtophanate hydrochloride.

It will be apparent to those skilled in the art which specific additional optional active agents may be beneficially included in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention. It will also be apparent to those skilled in the art that the additional optional active agents can be combined in any manner with as many or as few additional optional active agents desired, depending on the particular application. Preparations_and Use Generally, a composition, formulation, or food or beverage product of the present invention is prepared by combining appropriate concentrations of (a) p-alanine and/or a derivative of p-alanine, and (b) at least one agent that modulates the NMDA pathway. The compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention are prepared with effective amounts of (a) and (b). The effective amount of (a) for daily dosage can range from about 25 mg/kg body weight to about 91 mg/kg body weight per day. Preferably, the effective amount of (a) for daily dosage is between about25 mg/kg body weight to about 285 mg/kg body weight. The amounts of (a) and (b) in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention can be provided in a ratio of (a) to (b). Exemplary ratios of (a) to (b) include, for example, 1:5 to 1:15, 1:1 to 1:80, and 2:1 to 1500:1. In instances in which the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention are provided in a solid form, the preparation can include from about 4 to 88 %w/w of (a) and from 0.0005 to 45 %w/w of (b). In instances in which the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention are provided in a liquid form, the preparation can include from 5 to 90 %w/v of (a) and from 0.005 to 60 %w/v of (b). It should also be appreciated that (a) and (b) in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products can be present in admixture. The admixture can be processed to provide particles of an average particle size. As used herein, "particle size" refers to the diameter of the particle. "Average particle size" means that at least 50% of the particles in a sample will have the specified particle size. For example, at least a portion of the admixture can be fine-milled to provide an average particle size of between 50 nm and 2 pm. The use of dry milling techniques, combined with excipients and polymers, to form fine-milled particles improves flow and dispersibility, stability, resistance to moisture, bioavailability, and dissolution/release properties of the active agents. Additionally, (a) and (b) can be administered in the same preparation or different preparation, and can be administered together, in rapid succession, or at intervals, In some instances, (a) and (b) can be provided as commercially supplied raw materials. Alternatively, (a) and/or (b) may be preprocessed by routine methods. Examples of such preprocessing methods include, but are not limited to agglomeration, air suspension, chilling, air suspension drying, balling, coacervation, chilsonation, comminution, compression, pelletization, cryopelletization, extrusion, granulation, homogenization, inclusion compoundation, lyophilization, liposomal processing, lecithinization, melting, mixing, molding, pan coating, solvent dehydration, sonication, spheronization, spray chilling, spray congealing, spray drying, or other techniques known in the art according to the desired dosage form. In some instances, (a) or (b) can be post-processed (e.g., to improve the shelf life or stability of the active agents). For example, the methods disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2011/0250340 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) can be used to prepare a shelf stable liquid form of the active agent p-alanine. The compositions and formulations for use in accordance with the present invention can be prepared in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable (e.g., pharmaceutically or nutritionally acceptable) carriers, diluents, or excipients. Excipients that can be used include buffers (for example, citrate buffer, phosphate buffer, acetate buffer, and bicarbonate buffer), amino acids, urea, alcohols, ascorbic acid, phospholipids, proteins (for example, serum albumin), EDTA, sodium chloride, liposomes, mannitol, sorbitol, and glycerol. Routine methods useful for formulating preparations are known in the art and can be found in, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Gennaro, ed., Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md. ) . The compositions and formulations comprising (a) and (b) (or their physiologically acceptable derivatives, e.g., salts and/or solvates) can be prepared for administration by various routine methods. Examples of suitable administration methods include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intracranial, intraorbital, ophthalmic, intraventricular, intracapsular, intraspinal, intracisternal, intraperitoneal, transmucosal, or administration may be oral. The active agents can be prepared in various ways, depending on the route of administration, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Solid oral preparations for administration can include, for example, tablets or capsules or powders, prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically or nutritionally acceptable excipients such as binding agents (for example, pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (for example, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (for example, magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (for example, potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (for example, sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets can be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid oral preparations for administration can include, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they can be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations can be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically or nutritionally acceptable additives such as suspending agents (for example, sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (for example, lecithin may serve this function, or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (for example, almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (for example, methyl or propyl-ρhydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid) . The preparations can also contain buffer salts, flavoring, coloring and sweetening agents as appropriate. Preparations for oral administration can be formulated to give controlled release or sustained release of the active agents. Sustained released formulations are a conventional solution to the problem of rapid systemic clearance, as is well known to those of skill in the art (See, e.g., "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences," Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, 19th Edition, 1995). Osmotic delivery systems are also recognized methods for sustained drug delivery (See, e.g., Verma et al., Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm. 2000, 26:695-708). In a particular example, a composition or formulation of the present invention can be formulated for sustained release of β-alanine, as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0220575, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Tablets or lozenges, for example, can be prepared in a conventional manner for buccal or sublingual administration of a composition or formulation of the present invention. The nutritional compositions of the present invention can be prepared in any suitable form, e.g., a powder, a drink, a food bar, a cookie, a granule, a tablet, a pill, a capsule, a softgel, a gelcap, a solution, a salve, a lotion, or a suspension. The food or beverage products of the present invention can be prepared in any suitable form, for example, in the form of a fruit or juice products, concentrates of fruit or juice products, lemonades, dairy products, frozen confectionary products, baked goods, spreads, margarine, butter, peanut butter, honey,, pasta products, cereal products, ready-to-serve-dishes, frozen food, tinned food, syrups, sauces, fillings, dips, chewing gums, sherbet, spices, cooking salt, and instant drink powders. A beverage product of the present invention may be in the form of a powder or liquid concentrate to be mixed with a suitable liquid, e,g., water or milk, before consumption, or a ready-to-drink beverage (i.e., a beverage in liquid form ready to be consumed without adding liquid). A beverage of the present invention may be carbonated by any suitable method known in the art. The food or beverage product of the present invention can also be prepared with one or more additional agents commonly used in the food or beverage industry. Exemplary agents include, but are not limited to, thickeners, coloring agents, bulking agents, polyols, xylitol, mannitol, maltitol, preservatives, sodium or potassium benzoate, sodium or calcium carbonate, antioxidants, ascorbic acid, carotenoids, tocopherols or polyphenols, mono-, oligo- or polysaccharides, glucose, fructose, sucrose, soyoligosaccharides, xylooligosaccharides, galactooligosaccharides, artificial or natural non- or low-caloric sweeteners, aspartame, sucralose, acesulfame potassium, acidifiers in the form of edible acids, citric acids, acetic acid, lactic acid, apipic acid, flavors, emulsifiers, diluents, maltodextrin, wetting agents, glycerol, stabilizers, coatings, isotonic agents, and absorption promoting or delaying agents. The compositions and formulations of the present invention can be prepared for parenteral administration via injection, for example, via bolus or continuous infusion. Injected formulations can be presented in unit dosage form, such as ampoules or in multi-dose containers, preferably with an added preservative. The preparations can be formed as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and can contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active agents can be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, for example, sterile pyrogen-free water, before use . The compositions and formulations of the present invention can be prepared for use in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, for example, containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. The compositions and formulations of the present invention can also be prepared as a depot preparation. Depot preparations are long acting formulations that can be administered via implantation (e.g., subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or via intramuscular injection. For example, the preparations can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt. Because some of the active agents of the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention may act in the central nervous system, delivery techniques can be tailored to allow the preparation to cross the blood-brain barrier to increase the ability of the active agents to cross the blood-brain barrier. Examples of suitable techniques can be found in Begley, J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 48:136-146, 1996, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Alternatively, active agents of the present invention can be modified (e.g., chemically) using methods known in the art to facilitate their entry into the CNS. In some instances, it can be desirable to deliver a composition or formulation directly to the nervous system using techniques such as intraventricular injection (Kordower et al., Exp. Neurol., 124:21-30, 1993) or installation of an osmotic pump (e.g., an Alzet® pump), for example. Another exemplary technique is to surgically place an Omaya reservoir-shunt with in-line filter into the cisternal space. A composition or formulation in an appropriate excipient (e.g., phosphatebuffered saline) is instilled into the shunt by injection on a prescribed basis. For administration by inhalation, a composition or formulation of the present invention can be delivered, for example, as an aerosol spray with the use of a suitable propellant, for example, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas. Other suitable methods of nasal delivery known in the art can be used, including those that facilitate delivery of a predetermined dosage. The preparations can be presented in a pack or dispenser device, which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active agents. The pack may, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device can be accompanied by instructions for administration (e.g., FDA approved labeling information). As apparent to those skilled in the art, it is not necessary for all of the active agents of a composition or formulation to be administered in the same excipient, in the same form, or delivered at precisely the same time during a day. However, the active agents should be administered so they are present in the treated subject at the same time (e.g., present in a cell that is the target of treatment), and thus, one preparation, including all active agents, is generally provided in a convenient dosage form. This condition of treatment can be ascertained by assaying the appropriate body fluid (e.g., blood, plasma, serum, or cerebrospinal fluid) or body tissue (e.g., skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, or connective tissue) for the presence of components of a formulation or their metabolites. When monitoring the concentrations of active agents, attention must be paid to differential accumulation of agents and/or their metabolites in the particular body fluid being tested. In some instances, the active agents can be co-administered. As used herein, "co-administered" and/or "co-administration" refer to the administration of more than one active agent in the course of a coordinated treatment to achieve an improved clinical outcome. Such co-administration may also be coextensive; that is, occurring during overlapping periods of time. Veterinary Applications The compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention can be used in veterinary applications in instances in which an animal would benefit from enhanced physical performance (e.g,, training procedures for hunting dogs, guide dogs, police dogs, thoroughbred race horses, etc., or animals used in the movie industry). Animals that may benefit from enhanced physical performance include pets (e.g., dogs, cats, birds, fish, guinea pigs, rabbits, hares, ferrets), farm animals (fish, pigs, horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry), and show animals (e.g., tigers, bears, lions, elephants, etc.). All-Natural Compositions The compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention can be prepared as an "all-natural" preparation where each of the ingredients (e.g., active agents, etc.) is derived from a natural source (plant, animal, etc.) in a substantially unmodified form, i.e., the form in which the material exists in its natural origin. These ingredients may be obtained from their natural source using extraction or other separation means. The ingredients of the preparations may be organic or aqueous extracts and/or minerals and electrolytes, or fermentation products. Examples of suitable natural ingredients that can be used as active agents and additives for the preparations of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Methods of Use It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention can be administered as part of a variety of methods, e.g., methods of enhancing physical performance in a human or animal, methods of reducing paraesthesia in a human or animal (e.g., reducing intolerable paraesthesia in the human or animal to a tolerable level), methods of improving a human or animal's tolerance and compliance to higher doses of β-alanine, thereby reducing the length of time it takes to achieve peak effect of p-alanine on physical performance in the human or animal (e.g., reducing the time it takes to achieve peak effect of p-alanine on physical performance in a human or animal by up to 85% from between 4 and 6 weeks to between 4 and 6 days). It is to be understood that any of the active agents disclosed herein or apparent to skilled in the art based on such disclosure can be used as active agents in the foregoing methods of the present invention. It should also be understood that the active agents can be employed in the methods in any combination desired. An exemplary composition, formulation, or food or beverage product that can be administered in a method of the present invention comprises (a) p-alanine or a derivative of β-alanine; and (b) at least one agent that modulates the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) pathway. An exemplary method of the present invention is a method of enhancing physical performance in a human or animal comprising administering to the human or animal an effective amount of (a) β-3,ℓοη1η℮ or a derivative of β-alanine; and an effective amount of (b) at least one agent that modulates the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) pathway. Another exemplary method of the present invention is a method of reducing β-alanine-induced paraesthesia in a human or animal (e.g., reducing intolerable β-η1αη1η℮alanine-induced paraesthesia in the human or animal to a tolerable level) comprising administering to the human or animal an effective amount of (a) β-℮1ηη1η℮ or a derivative of β-alanine; and an effective amount of (b) at least one agent that modulates the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) pathway. Yet another exemplary method of the present invention is a method of improving tolerance and compliance to higher doses of β-alanine so as to reduce the time it takes to achieve peak effect of p-alanine on physical performance in a human or animal comprising administering to the human or animal an effective amount of (a) p-alanine or a derivative of p-alanine; and an effective amount of (b) at least one agent that modulates the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) pathway, wherein the at least one agent that modulates the NMDA pathway improves tolerance and compliance to higher doses of p-alanine, thereby reducing the length of time it takes to achieve peak effect of fi-alanine on physical performance in the human or animal % (e.g., the length of time it takes to achieve peak effect of p-alanine on physical performance is reduced from 4-6 weeks to 4-6 days, i.e., reduced by up to about 85%). For clarity, it is to be understood that it is within the scope and spirit of the present invention to employ one or more of component (a) and/or one or more of component (b) together in a composition, formulation or food or beverage product of the present invention and associated methods. As used herein, ''one or more" includes any or all of the possible combinations that can be derived using components (a) and/or (b), and in any combination desired. As used herein, "combination" is to be interpreted broadly such that the combination can include multiple forms of β-alanine in combination with each other or with β-℮1ηη1η℮ and/or a derivative of β-alanine, as well as multiple derivatives of p-alanine, if desired. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that this broad interpretation of combination applies equally to the agents that modulate the NMDA pathway. The active agents (a) and (b) can be present in admixture in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products administered in the methods of the present invention. The active agents (a) and (b) can also be chemically linked together in the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention, for example via a covalent bond (e.g., in the form of a dipeptide comprising (a) and (b), e.g., p-alanyl-L-theanine) or an ionic bond (e.g., in the form of a salt comprising (a) and (b), e.g., β-alanine-Ltheanate) that is broken upon administration of the composition, formulation, and food or beverage product to a human or animal in such a way that both (a) and (b) impart a therapeutic effect to the human or animal. Any suitable method of administration disclosed herein (e.g., orally) or apparent to those skilled in the art can be used to administer the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products in the methods of the present invention. The compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products administered in the methods of the present invention enhance physical performance in a human or animal. The compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products administered in the methods of the present invention do not elicit intolerable paraesthesia (e.g., moderate or severe paraesthesia typically elicited by administration of high doses of p-alanine). The compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products administered in the methods of the present invention improve compliance with and tolerance of higher doses of p-alanine (or a derivative of p-alanine), thereby permitting usage of higher doses of p-alanine when compared to f-alanine administered alone. The compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products administered in the methods of the present invention reduce the length of time it takes to achieve effect (e.g., peak effect) of p-alanine on physical performance (e.g., the time it takes to achieve peak effect of β-℮1αη1η℮ on physical performance is reduced from between four and six weeks to between four and six days, i.e., a reduction of up to about 85% of the time it takes to achieve peak effect of β-℮1℮η1η℮ on physical performance compared to β-℮1ηη1η℮ administered alone in a traditional manner). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the advantages and benefits of the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention can be measured both subjectively and objectively in a variety of suitable ways. For example, carnosine concentrations in human skeletal muscle generally range between 15-40 mmol/kg dry weight. The reduction in the length of time it takes to achieve effect of β-℮1ηη1η℮ on physical performance in a human or animal can be measured by assaying the concentration of p-alanyl-L-histidine (carnosine) dipeptides directly in the skeletal muscle tissue or by assaying the activity of carnosinasel (CN1) in the serum (an indirect measure shown to correlate well with skeletal muscle carnosine concentration) of the human or animal. Alternatively, the pharmacokinetics of an acute, orally administered β-alanine dose may be obtained by assaying the concentration of β-η1ηη1η℮ in the blood plasma and urine. Peak effect of p-alanine on physical performance in the human or animal is typically achieved when the baseline skeletal muscle β-alanyl-L-histidine (carnosine) dipeptides concentration increases by a minimum of -10-15 mmol/kg dry weight. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that measurable benefit (e.g., ergogenic benefit) of β-alanine is typically achieved when the amount of carnosine synthesized in the human or animal reaches a level that is about 40% to about 60% greater than a baseline level of carnosine synthesized. For example, baseline carnosine levels in the human or animal can be measured once or at successive intervals before administration of a composition, formulation or food or beverage product of the present invention. Carnosine levels can then be measured at successive intervals (e.g., daily, weekly or monthly, for example) in the human or animal after administration of the composition, formulation or food or beverage product of the present invention. Carnosine levels measured at each successive interval are measured and then compared to the baseline. When the amount of carnosine synthesized in the human or animal reaches a level that is about 40% to about 60% greater than baseline, an effect of β-η1ηη1η℮ (e.g., on physical performance) is achieved. It is expected that the carnosine levels will be about 40% greater than baseline in as few as 4-6 days of administration of a composition, formulation, or food or beverage product of the present invention. During the course of work described herein, the inventors demonstrated that the compositions, formulations, and food or beverage products of the present invention comprising p-alanine and at least one agent that modulates the NMDA pathway are useful for improving tolerance and compliance to higher doses of β-alanine. Specifically, the change in 100 mm anchored VAS ratings for paraesthesia (burning, tingling, pricking and flushing sensations) was evaluated utilizing an acute, single-blinded, latin square crossover design comparing β-alanine to β-alanine combined with two doses of an agent that modulates the NMDA pathway agent(one dose at a 1:6 ratio and another at 1:12 ratio of β-η1ηη1η℮ to the agent that modulates the NMDA pathway). The visual analog scale (VAS) is a an anchored, standardized 100 mm or 150 mm scale has been demonstrated to be a valid, reliable and methodologically sound instrument for quantitative assessment of pain, discomfort or other psychometric parameters. A minimum clinically significant difference in VAS rating for pain or paraesthesia appears to range from 13 mm to 16 mm with a 95% confidence interval. (See e.g., Gallagher, et al., Am J Emerg Med. 2002; 20(4):287-90; Bouhassira, et al., Pain. 2004; 108 (3) :248 - 57; Poliakov, et al. Eur J Pain. 2011 Nov;15(10):1015-22; and Eisenberg, et al. Eur J Pain. 1998;2(4):321-327). VAS rating instruments have also been deemed specific and sensitive to detect the effects of an intervention on paraesthesia and neuropathic pain. Evidence in support of the present invention was obtained by evaluating the change in 100 mm anchored VAS ratings for parasthesias (burning, tingling, itching, pricking and flushing sensations) utilizing an acute, single-blinded, latin square cross-over design comparing β-℮1ηη1η℮ to β-η1ηη1η℮ plus two doses of an NMDA modulating agent (one dose at 1:6 ratio and another at 1:12 ratio of p-alanine to the NMDA modulating agent. Notably, the individuals' anchored 100mm VAS scores, on a scale from 0-100mm, changed from 60mm-90mm (when ingesting (3-alanine alone) to about a 10mm-30mm (when ingesting p-alanine and at least one agent that modulates the NMDA pathway). * * * One skilled in the art readily appreciates that the present invention is well adapted to carry out the objects and obtain the ends and advantages mentioned, as well as those inherent therein.

Examples Example 1 During the course or work described herein, a pilot study was conducted in 3 healthy men to demonstrate that co-administration of p-alanine and at least one agent that modulates the NMDA pathway improves tolerance and compliance to higher doses of p-alanine. Each subject completed three trials, labeled "A", "B", and "C" using a Latin square design (i.e. subject 1 completed trials in ABC order, subject 2 completed trials in BCA order, and subject 3 completed trials in CAB order). Trial A consisted of the oral ingestion of 3.2 g p-alanine, trial Β consisted of 6.4 g p-alanine + 500 mg L-theanine, trial C consisted of 6.4 g p-alanine + 1000 mg L-theanine. Blood samples were drawn into lithium heparin tubes at baseline (time 0), 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 4 hr post ingestion, spun in a clinical centrifuge for 15 minutes, and processed to obtain plasma. Plasma was immediately frozen at -80 degrees C until analysis for p-alanine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results indicated a significant increase in plasma p-alanine from the 3.2 g to both 6,4 g doses, as well as a significant reduction in symptoms of paraesthesia in all subjects when L-theanine was co-ingested. Notably, the net retention of β-alanine (measured via subtracting the urinary loss of p-alanine during the period of collection from the areaunder-the-plasma-curve) was greatest in trial Β (see Figure 2 and Table 1). Table 1. Subject Trial Net Loss (uMol) 1 A 10167.5 Β 35843.2 C 29004.5 2 A 8606.6 Β 57842.4 C 69873.9 3 A 8749.3 Β 14425.6 C 45274.7 Mean (SD) A 9174.5 (862.96) Β 36037.1 (21709.05) C 48051.0 (20575.66) Example 2 A proof of concept study was carried out in 10 human subjects to evaluate the effect of a composition comprising component (a) together with one agent from component (b) on reducing the paresthetic response associated with p-alanine administration. The subjects' sensory responses were measured with an anchored 100mm VAS (see FIGS. 3-6). As is shown in FIGS. 3-6, the composition significantly improved subject tolerance to large doses of p-alanine, for example, by reducing the paraesthetic response (i.e., the composition comprising p-alanine and L-theanine significantly decreased the subjects' sensations of overall discomfort from burning (FIG. 3), itching (FIG. 4), flushing (FIG. 5), and pins and needles (FIG. 6) compared to the administration of the same dose of β-alanine alone). Example 3 Another pilot study was conducted in 6 human subjects to evaluate the effect of a composition comprising of component (a) together with one botanical agent from component (b) (Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa extract)on reducing the paresthetic response associated with β-alanine administration. The subjects' sensory responses were measured with an anchored 100mm VAS (see FIG. 7). As is shown in FIG. 7, the composition significantly improved subject tolerance to large doses of p-alanine, for example, by reducing the paraesthetic response (i.e., the composition comprising β-℮1ηη1η℮ and Ziziphus jujube var. spinosa extract significantly decreased the subjects' sensations of overall discomfort due to burning, itching, flushing, and/or tingling compared to the administration of the same dose of β-alanine alone). Example 4 An additional pilot study was conducted in 5 human subjects to evaluate the effect of a composition comprising of component (a) together with two agents from component (b) (Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa extract and L-theanine)on reducing the overall discomfort/ paresthetic response associated with_p-alanine administration. The subjects' sensory responses were measured with an anchored 100mm VAS (SEE FIG. 8). As is shown in FIG. 8, the composition significantly improved subject tolerance to large doses of β-alanine, for example, by reducing the paresthetic response (i.e., the 5 composition comprising p-alanine, Ziziphus jujube var. spinosa extract, and L-theanine significantly decreased the subjects' sensations of overall discomfort due to burning, itching, flushing, and/or tingling compared to the administration of the same dose of p-alanine alone). 1.
