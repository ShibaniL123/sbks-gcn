RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/977,215, filed on Apr. 9, 2014, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference thereto. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Camera modules (or components) are often employed in mobile phones, laptop computers, digital cameras, digital video cameras, etc. Examples include, for instance, compact camera modules that include a lens barrel mounted to a base, digital camera shutter modules, components of digital cameras, cameras in games, medical cameras, surveillance cameras, etc. Various attempts have been made to use aromatic polymers for the molded parts of a camera module. Unfortunately, various problems are often experienced when attempting to form such molded parts from aromatic polymers. For example, friction between molded parts, as well as between a molded part and a collecting tray, can induce electrostatic charge, which can lead to the formation of dust particles (e.g., during transportation) if not handled properly. In certain products, such as compact camera modules, these dust particles are detrimental and can lead to significant product defects. As such, a need exists for a polymer composition that has a reduced tendency to create a static electric charge during a molding operation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a polymer composition is disclosed that comprises an ionic liquid that is distributed within a polymer matrix. The ionic liquid has a melting temperature of about 400° C. or less and is a salt that contains a cationic species and counterion. The polymer matrix includes an aromatic polymer having a glass transition temperature of about 100° C. or more. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a molded part is disclosed that comprises a polymer composition. The polymer composition comprises an ionic liquid distributed within a polymer matrix, and the polymer matrix includes an aromatic polymer having a glass transition temperature of about 100° C. or more. Other features and aspects of the present invention are set forth in greater detail below. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES A full and enabling disclosure of the present invention, including the best mode thereof to one skilled in the art, is set forth more particularly in the remainder of the specification, including reference to the accompanying figures, in which: FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of one embodiment of a fine pitch electrical connector that may be formed according to the present invention; FIG. 2 is a front view of opposing walls of the fine pitch electrical connector of FIG. 1; FIG. 3 is a schematic illustration of one embodiment of an extruder screw that may be used to form the polymer composition of the present invention; FIGS. 4-5 are respective front and rear perspective views of an electronic component that can employ an antenna structure formed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention; and FIGS. 6-7 are perspective and front views of a compact camera module (“CCM”) that may be formed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION It is to be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the present discussion is a description of exemplary embodiments only, and is not intended as limiting the broader aspects of the present invention. Generally speaking, the present invention is directed to a polymer composition having a reduced tendency to create a static electric charge during a molding operation, transportation, assembly, handling, etc. More particularly, the composition contains an ionic liquid that is distributed within a polymer matrix that includes an aromatic polymer. In addition to being electrically conductive, the ionic liquid can exist in liquid form during melt processing, which allows it to be more uniformly blended within the polymer matrix. This improves electrical connectivity and thereby enhances the ability of the composition to rapidly dissipate static electric charges from its surface. This antistatic behavior can be characterized by a relatively low surface and/or volume resistivity as determined in accordance with IEC 60093. Namely, a molded part formed from the polymer composition may exhibits a surface resistivity of about 1×1015 ohms or less, in some embodiments about 1×1014 ohms or less, in some embodiments from about 1×109 ohms to about 9×1013 ohms, and in some embodiments, from about 1×1010 to about 1×1013 ohms. Likewise, the molded part may also exhibit a volume resistivity of about 1×1015 ohm-m or less, in some embodiments from about 1×109 ohm-m to about 9×1014 ohm-m, and in some embodiments, from about 1×1010 to about 5×1014 ohm-m. The present inventor has also discovered that the ability of the ionic liquid to be readily dispersed within the polymer matrix can allow for the use of relatively low concentrations to achieve the desired antistatic properties. Because it is employed in relatively low concentrations, however, the thermal and mechanical properties of the composition are not adversely impacted. In this regard, ionic liquids typically constitute from about 0.1 wt. % to about 10 wt. %, in some embodiments from about 0.3 wt. % to about 5 wt. %, in some embodiments from about 0.4 wt. % to about 3 wt. %, and in some embodiments, from about 0.5 wt. % to about 1.5 wt. % of the polymer composition. While the concentration of the aromatic polymers may generally vary based on the presence of other optional components, they are typically present in an amount of from about 25 wt. % to about 95 wt. %, in some embodiments from about 30 wt. % to about 80 wt. %, and in some embodiments, from about 40 wt. % to about 70 wt. %. Various embodiments of the present invention will now be described in more detail. I. Aromatic Polymer The aromatic polymer employed in the polymer composition is generally a “high performance” polymer in that it has a relatively high glass transition temperature, which can provide a substantial degree of heat resistance to the resulting composition. For example, the aromatic polymer may have a glass transition temperature of about 100° C. or more, in some embodiments about 120° C. or more, in some embodiments from about 140° C. to about 350° C., and in some embodiments, from about 150° C. to about 320° C. The glass transition temperature may be determined as is well known in the art using differential scanning calorimetry (“DSC”), such as determined by ISO Test No. 11357. The aromatic polymer is typically substantially amorphous or semi-crystalline in nature. One example of a suitable semi-crystalline aromatic polymer, for instance, is an aromatic polyamide. Particularly suitable aromatic polyamides are those having a relatively high melting temperature, such as about 200° C. or more, in some embodiments about 220° C. or more, and in some embodiments, from about 240° C. to about 320° C., as determined using differential scanning calorimetry according to ISO Test No. 11357. The glass transition temperature of aromatic polyamides is likewise generally from about 110° C. to about 160° C. Aromatic polyamides typically contain repeating units held together by amide linkages (NH—CO) and are synthesized through the polycondensation of dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aromatic dicarboxylic acids), diamines (e.g., aliphatic diamines), etc. For example, the aromatic polyamide may contain aromatic repeating units derived from an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, such as terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 2,7-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 1,4-phenylenedioxy-diacetic acid, 1,3-phenylenedioxy-diacetic acid, diphenic acid, 4,4′-oxydibenzoic acid, diphenylmethane-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, diphenylsulfone-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylic acid, etc., as well as combinations thereof. Terephthalic acid is particularly suitable. Of course, it should also be understood that other types of acid units may also be employed, such as aliphatic dicarboxylic acid units, polyfunctional carboxylic acid units, etc. The aromatic polyamide may also contain aliphatic repeating units derived from an aliphatic diamine, which typically has from 4 to 14 carbon atoms. Examples of such diamines include linear aliphatic alkylenediamines, such as 1,4-tetramethylenediamine, 1,6-hexanediamine, 1,7-heptanediamine, 1,8-octanediamine, 1,9-nonanediamine, 1,10-decanediamine, 1,11-undecanediamine, 1,12-dodecanediamine, etc.; branched aliphatic alkylenediamines, such as 2-methyl-1,5-pentanediamine, 3-methyl-1,5 pentanediamine, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,6-hexanediamine, 2,4,4-trimethyl-1,6-hexanediamine, 2,4-dimethyl-1,6-hexanediamine, 2-methyl-1,8-octanediamine, 5-methyl-1,9-nonanediamine, etc.; as well as combinations thereof. Repeating units derived from 1,9-nonanediamine and/or 2-methyl-1,8-octanediamine are particularly suitable. Of course, other diamine units may also be employed, such as alicyclic diamines, aromatic diamines, etc. Particularly suitable polyamides may include poly(nonamethylene terephthalamide) (PA9T), poly(nonamethylene terephthalamide/nonamethylene decanediamide) (PA9T/910), poly(nonamethylene terephthalamide/nonamethylene dodecanediamide) (PA9T/912), poly(nonamethylene terephthalamide/11-aminoundecanamide) (PA9T/11), poly(nonamethylene terephthalamide/12-aminododecanamide) (PA9T/12), poly(decamethylene terephthalamide/11-aminoundecanamide) (PA 10T/11), poly(decamethylene terephthalamide/12-aminododecanamide) (PA10T/12), poly(decamethylene terephthalamide/decamethylene decanediamide) (PA10T/1010), poly(decamethylene terephthalamide/decamethylene dodecanediamide) (PA10T/1012), poly(decamethylene terephlhalamide/tetramethylene hexanediamide) (PA10T/46), poly(decamethylene terephthalamide/caprolactam) (PA10T/6), poly(decamethylene terephthalamide/hexamethylene hexanediamide) (PA10T/66), poly(dodecamethylene lerephthalamide/dodecamelhylene dodecanediarnide) (PA12T/1212), poly(dodecamethylene terephthalamide/caprolactam) (PA12T/6), poly(dodecamethylene terephthalamide/hexamethylene hexanediamide) (PA12T/66), and so forth. Yet other examples of suitable aromatic polyamides are described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,324,307 to Harder, et al. Another suitable semi-crystalline aromatic polymer that may be employed in the present invention is a polyaryletherketone. Polyaryletherketones are semi-crystalline polymers with a relatively high melting temperature, such as from about 300° C. to about 400° C., in some embodiments from about 310° C. to about 390° C., and in some embodiments, from about 330° C. to about 380° C. The glass transition temperature may likewise be from about 110° C. to about 200° C. Particularly suitable polyaryletherketones are those that primarily include phenyl moieties in conjunction with ketone and/or ether moieties. Examples of such polymers include polyetheretherketone (“PEEK”), polyetherketone (“PEK”), polyetherketoneketone (“PEKK”), polyetherketoneetherketoneketone (“PEKEKK”), polyetheretherketoneketone (“PEEKK”), polyether-diphenyl-ether-ether-diphenyl-ether-phenyl-ketone-phenyl, etc., as well as blends and copolymers thereof. Of course, as indicated above, substantially amorphous polymers may also be employed in the polymer composition that lack a distinct melting point temperature. Suitable amorphous polymers may include, for instance, polyphenylene oxide (“PPO”), aromatic polycarbonates, aromatic polyetherimides, etc. Aromatic polycarbonates, for instance, typically have a glass transition temperature of from about 130° C. to about 160° C. and contain aromatic repeating units derived from one or more aromatic diols. Particularly suitable aromatic diols are bisphenols, such as gem-bisphenols in which two phenols groups are attached to a single carbon atom of a bivalent connecting radical. Examples of such bisphenols may include, for instance, such as 4,4′-isopropylidenediphenol (“bisphenol A”), 4,4′-ethylidenediphenol, 4,4′-(4-chloro-a-methylbenzylidene)diphenol, 4,4′cyclohexylidenediphenol, 4,4 (cyclohexylmethylene)diphenol, etc., as well as combinations thereof. The aromatic dial may be reacted with a phosgene. For example, the phosgene may be a carbonyl chloride having the formula C(O)Cl2. An alternative route to the synthesis of an aromatic polycarbonate may involve the transesterification of the aromatic diol (e.g., bisphenol) with a diphenyl carbonate. II. Ionic Liquid The ionic liquid of the present invention may be a salt that has a low enough melting temperature so that it can be in the form of a liquid when melt processed with the aromatic polymer. For example, the melting temperature of the ionic liquid may be about 400° C. or less, in some embodiments about 350° C. or less, in some embodiments from about 1° C. to about 100° C., and in some embodiments, from about 5° C. to about 50° C. The salt contains a cationic species and counterion. The cationic species contains a compound having at least one heteroatom (e.g., nitrogen or phosphorous) as a “cationic center.” Examples of such heteroatomic compounds include, for instance, quaternary oniums having the following structures: wherein, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, and R8 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen; substituted or unsubstituted C1-C10 alkyl groups (e.g., methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, etc.); substituted or unsubstituted C3-C14 cycloalkyl groups (e.g., adamantyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclooctyl, cyclohexenyl, etc.); substituted or unsubstituted C1-C10 alkenyl groups (e.g., ethylene, propylene, 2-methypropylene, pentylene, etc.); substituted or unsubstituted C2-C10 alkynyl groups (e.g., ethynyl, propynyl, etc.); substituted or unsubstituted C1-C10 alkoxy groups (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, t-butoxy, sec-butoxy, n-pentoxy, etc.); substituted or unsubstituted acyloxy groups (e.g., methacryloxy, methacryloxyethyl, etc.); substituted or unsubstituted aryl groups (e.g., phenyl); substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl groups (e.g., pyridyl, furanyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, triazolyl, imidazolyl, isoxazolyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, quinolyl, etc.); and so forth. In one particular embodiment, for example, the cationic species may be an ammonium compound having the structure N+R1R2R3R4 wherein R1, R2, and/or R3 are independently a C1-C6 alkyl (e.g., methyl, ethyl, butyl, etc.) and R4 is hydrogen or a C1-C4 alkyl group (e.g., methyl or ethyl). For example, the cationic component may be tri-butylmethylammonium, wherein R1, R2, and R3 are butyl and R4 is methyl. Suitable counterions for the cationic species may include, for example, halogens (e.g., chloride, bromide, iodide, etc.); sulfates or sulfonates (e.g., methyl sulfate, ethyl sulfate, butyl sulfate, hexyl sulfate, octyl sulfate, hydrogen sulfate, methane sulfonate, dodecylbenzene sulfonate, dodecylsulfate, trifluoromethane sulfonate, heptadecafluorooctanesulfonate, sodium dodecylethoxysulfate, etc.); sulfosuccinates; amides (e.g., dicyanamide); imides (e.g., bis(pentafluoroethyl-sulfonyl)imide, bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, bis(trifluoromethyl)imide, etc.); borates (e.g., tetrafluoroborate, tetracyanoborate, bis[oxalato]borate, bis[salicylato]borate, etc.); phosphates or phosphinates (e.g., hexafluorophosphate, diethylphosphate, bis(pentafluoroethyl)phosphinate, tris(pentafluoroethyl)-trifluorophosphate, tris(nonafluorobutyl)trifluorophosphate, etc.); antimonates (e.g., hexafluoroantimonate); aluminates (e.g., tetrachloroaluminate); fatty acid carboxylates (e.g., oleate, isostearate, pentadecafluorooctanoate, etc.); cyanates; acetates; and so forth, as well as combinations of any of the foregoing. To help improve compatibility with the aromatic polymer, it may be desired to select a counterion that is generally hydrophobic in nature, such as imides, fatty acid carboxylates, etc. Particularly suitable hydrophobic counterions may include, for instance, bis(pentafluoroethylsulfonyl)imide, bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, and bis(trifluoromethyl)imide. III. Optional Components A. Conductive Fillers In addition to the ionic liquid, other conductive fillers may also be employed in the polymer composition to help improve its antistatic characteristics. Examples of suitable conductive fillers may include, for instance, metal particles (e.g., aluminum flakes), metal fibers, carbon particles (e.g., graphite, expanded graphite, grapheme, carbon black, graphitized carbon black, etc.), carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers, and so forth. Carbon fibers and graphite are particularly suitable. In certain embodiments, a synergistic affect may be achieved by using the ionic liquid and conductive fillers in combination. Without intending to be limited by theory, the present inventor believes that the ionic liquid is able to readily flow during melt processing to help provide a better connection and electrical pathway between certain conductive fillers (e.g., carbon fibers, graphite, etc.) and the polymer matrix, thereby further reducing surface resistivity. When employed, the conductive fillers typically constitute from about 0.5 wt. % to about 30 wt. %, in some embodiments from about 1 wt. % to about 25 wt. %, and in some embodiments, from about 2 wt. % to about 20 wt. % of the polymer composition. B. Fibrous Fillers Fibrous fillers, which are not generally conductive, may also be employed in the polymer composition to help improve strength. Examples of such fibrous fillers may include those formed from glass, ceramics (e.g., alumina, silica, titanium dioxide, etc.), minerals (e.g., wollastonite, xonotlite, dawsonite, etc.), polymers, such as aramids (e.g., Kevlar® marketed by E.I. du Pont de Nemours, Wilmington, Del., polyolefins, polyesters, etc., as well as mixtures thereof. Particularly suitable glass fibers may include, for instance, E-glass, A-glass, C-glass, D-glass, AR-glass, R-glass, S1-glass, S2-glass, etc., and mixtures thereof. The volume average length of such glass fibers may be relatively small, such as from about 10 to about 500 micrometers, in some embodiments from about 100 to about 400 micrometers, in some embodiments from about 150 to about 350 micrometers, and in some embodiments, from about 200 to about 325 micrometers. The glass fibers may also have a narrow length distribution. That is, at least about 70% by volume of the fibers, in some embodiments at least about 80% by volume of the fibers, and in some embodiments, at least about 90% by volume of the fibers have a length within the ranges noted above. Such a small length and/or narrow distribution can further help achieve a desirable combination of strength, flowability, and surface quality, which enables it to be uniquely suited for molded parts with a small dimensional tolerance. In addition to possessing the length characteristics noted above, the glass fibers may also have a relatively high aspect ratio (average length divided by nominal diameter) to help improve the mechanical properties and surface quality of the resulting polymer composition. For example, the fibers may have an aspect ratio of from about 1 to about 100, in some embodiments from about 10 to about 60, and in some embodiments, from about 30 to about 50 are particularly beneficial. The fibers may, for example, have a nominal diameter of from about 1 to about 35 micrometers, in some embodiments from about 2 to about 20 micrometers, and in some embodiments, from about 3 to about 10 micrometers. Mineral fibers (also known as “whiskers”) are also suitable for use in the present invention. Particularly suitable are anhydrous calcium sulfate and wollastonite fibers, such as those available from Nyco Minerals under the trade designation NYGLOS® (e.g., NYGLOS® 4W or NYGLOS® 8). The volume average length of such mineral fibers may be relatively small, such as from about 1 to about 200 micrometers, in some embodiments from about 2 to about 150 micrometers, in some embodiments from about 5 to about 100 micrometers, and in some embodiments, from about 10 to about 50 micrometers. In addition to possessing the length characteristics noted above, the mineral fibers may also have a relatively high aspect ratio (average length divided by nominal diameter) to help further improve the mechanical properties and surface quality of the resulting polymer composition. For example, the mineral fibers may have an aspect ratio of from about 1 to about 50, in some embodiments from about 2 to about 20, and in some embodiments, from about 4 to about 15. The whiskers may, for example, have a nominal diameter of from about 1 to about 35 micrometers, in some embodiments from about 2 to about 20 micrometers, and in some embodiments, from about 3 to about 15 micrometers. Regardless of the particular type employed, the relative amount of the fibrous filler in the polymer composition may be selectively controlled to help achieve the desired mechanical properties without adversely impacting other properties of the composition, such as its flowability. For example, fibrous fillers (e.g., glass fibers, mineral fibers, etc., as well as combinations thereof) typically constitute from about 2 wt. % to about 40 wt. %, in some embodiments from about 5 wt. % to about 35 wt. %, and in some embodiments, from about 6 wt. % to about 30 wt. % of the polymer composition. Although the fibers may be employed within the ranges noted above, one particularly beneficial aspect of the present invention is that small fiber contents may be employed while still achieving the desired mechanical properties. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the narrow length distribution of the fibers can help achieve excellent mechanical properties, thus allowing for the use of a smaller amount of fibers. C. Particulate Fillers Particulate fillers, which are not generally conductive, may also be employed in the polymer composition to help achieve the desired properties and/or color. When employed, such particulate fillers typically constitute from about 5% by weight to about 40% by weight, in some embodiments from about 10% by weight to about 35% by weight, and in some embodiments, from about 10% by weight to about 30% by weight of the polymer composition. Clay minerals may be particularly suitable for use in the present invention. Examples of such clay minerals include, for instance, talc (Mg3Si4O10(OH)2), halloysite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), illite ((K,H3O)(Al,Mg,Fe)2 (Si,Al)4O10[(OH)2,(H2O)]), montmorillonite (Na,Ca)0.33(Al,Mg)2Si4O10(OH)2.nH2O), vermiculite ((MgFe,Al)3(Al,Si)4O10(OH)2.4 H2O), palygorskite ((Mg,Al)2Si4O10(OH).4(H2O)), pyrophyllite (Al2Si4O10(OH)2), etc., as well as combinations thereof. In lieu of, or in addition to, clay minerals, still other particulate fillers may also be employed. For example, other suitable silicate fillers may also be employed, such as calcium silicate, aluminum silicate, mica, diatomaceous earth, wollastonite, and so forth. Mica, for instance, may be a particularly suitable mineral for use in the present invention. There are several chemically distinct mica species with considerable variance in geologic occurrence, but all have essentially the same crystal structure. As used herein, the term “mica” is meant to generically include any of these species, such as muscovite (KAl2(AlSi3)O10(OH)2), biotite (K(Mg,Fe)3(AlSi3)O10(OH)2), phlogopite (KMg3(AlSi3)O10(OH)2), lepidolite (K(Li,Al)2-3(AlSi3)O10(OH)2), glauconite (K,Na)(Al,Mg,Fe)2(Si,Al)4O10(OH)2), etc., as well as combinations thereof. D. Other Additives Still other additives that can be included in the composition may include, for instance, antimicrobials, pigments, antioxidants, stabilizers, surfactants, waxes, solid solvents, flame retardants, anti-drip additives, and other materials added to enhance properties and processability. Lubricants may also be employed in the polymer composition that are capable of withstanding the processing conditions of the aromatic polymer without substantial decomposition. Examples of such lubricants include fatty acids esters, the salts thereof, esters, fatty acid amides, organic phosphate esters, and hydrocarbon waxes of the type commonly used as lubricants in the processing of engineering plastic materials, including mixtures thereof. Suitable fatty acids typically have a backbone carbon chain of from about 12 to about 60 carbon atoms, such as myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachic acid, montanic acid, octadecinic acid, parinric acid, and so forth. Suitable esters include fatty acid esters, fatty alcohol esters, wax esters, glycerol esters, glycol esters and complex esters. Fatty acid amides include fatty primary amides, fatty secondary amides, methylene and ethylene bisamides and alkanolamides such as, for example, palmitic acid amide, stearic acid amide, oleic acid amide, N,N′-ethylenebisstearamide and so forth. Also suitable are the metal salts of fatty acids such as calcium stearate, zinc stearate, magnesium stearate, and so forth; hydrocarbon waxes, including paraffin waxes, polyolefin and oxidized polyolefin waxes, and microcrystalline waxes. Particularly suitable lubricants are acids, salts, or amides of stearic acid, such as pentaerythritol tetrastearate, calcium stearate, or N,N′-ethylenebisstearamide. When employed, the lubricant(s) typically constitute from about 0.05 wt. % to about 1.5 wt. %, and in some embodiments, from about 0.1 wt. % to about 0.5 wt. % (by weight) of the polymer composition. IV. Formation The aromatic polymer, ionic liquid, and other optional additives may be melt processed or blended together within a temperature range of from about 250° C. to about 450° C., in some embodiments, from about 280° C. to about 400° C., and in some embodiments, from about 300° C. to about 380° C. to form the polymer composition. Any of a variety of melt processing techniques may generally be employed in the present invention. For example, the components (e.g., aromatic polymer, ionic liquid, etc.) may be supplied separately or in combination to an extruder that includes at least one screw rotatably mounted and received within a barrel (e.g., cylindrical barrel) and may define a feed section and a melting section located downstream from the feed section along the length of the screw. The extruder may be a single screw or twin screw extruder. Referring to FIG. 3, for example, one embodiment of a single screw extruder 80 is shown that contains a housing or barrel 114 and a screw 120 rotatably driven on one end by a suitable drive 124 (typically including a motor and gearbox). If desired, a twin-screw extruder may be employed that contains two separate screws. The configuration of the screw is not particularly critical to the present invention and it may contain any number and/or orientation of threads and channels as is known in the art. As shown in FIG. 3, for example, the screw 120 contains a thread that forms a generally helical channel radially extending around a core of the screw 120. A hopper 40 is located adjacent to the drive 124 for supplying the polymer and/or other materials (e.g., inorganic particles) through an opening in the barrel 114 to the feed section 132. Opposite the drive 124 is the output end 144 of the extruder 80, where extruded plastic is output for further processing. A feed section 132 and melt section 134 are defined along the length of the screw 120. The feed section 132 is the input portion of the barrel 114 where the aromatic polymer and/or the ionic liquid are added. The melt section 134 is the phase change section in which the aromatic polymer is changed from a solid to a liquid. While there is no precisely defined delineation of these sections when the extruder is manufactured, it is well within the ordinary skill of those in this art to reliably identify the feed section 132 and the melt section 134 in which phase change from solid to liquid is occurring. Although not necessarily required, the extruder 80 may also have a mixing section 136 that is located adjacent to the output end of the barrel 114 and downstream from the melting section 134. If desired, one or more distributive and/or dispersive mixing elements may be employed within the mixing and/or melting sections of the extruder. Suitable distributive mixers for single screw extruders may include, for instance, Saxon, Dulmage, Cavity Transfer mixers, etc. Likewise, suitable dispersive mixers may include Blister ring, Leroy/Maddock, CRD mixers, etc. As is well known in the art, the mixing may be further improved by using pins in the barrel that create a folding and reorientation of the polymer melt, such as those used in Buss Kneader extruders, Cavity Transfer mixers, and Vortex Intermeshing Pin mixers. When employed, fibers (e.g., conductive fillers, such as carbon fibers, and/or fibrous fillers, such as glass fibers) can also be added to the hopper 40 or at a location downstream therefrom. In one particular embodiment, fibers may be added a location downstream from the point at which the aromatic polymer is supplied, but yet prior to the melting section. In FIG. 3, for instance, a hopper 42 is shown that is located within a zone of the feed section 132 of the extruder 80. The fibers supplied to the hopper 42 may be initially relatively long, such as having a volume average length of from about 1,000 to about 5,000 micrometers, in some embodiments from about 2,000 to about 4,500 micrometers, and in some embodiments, from about 3,000 to about 4,000 micrometers. Nevertheless, by supplying these long fibers at a location where the aromatic polymer is still in a solid state, the polymer can act as an abrasive agent for reducing the size of the fibers to a volume average length and length distribution as indicated above. It should be understood, however, any optional fibers may simply be supplied to the extruder at the desired length. In such embodiments, the fibers may, for example, be supplied at the mixing and/or melting sections of the extruder, or even at the feed section in conjunction with the aromatic polymer. In yet other embodiments, fibers may not be employed at all. Regardless of the particular manner in which it is formed, the present inventor has discovered that the resulting polymer composition can possess excellent thermal properties. For example, the melt viscosity of the polymer composition may be low enough so that it can readily flow into the cavity of a mold having small dimensions. In one particular embodiment, the polymer composition may have a melt viscosity of from about 0.1 to about 80 Pa-s, in some embodiments from about 0.5 to about 50 Pa-s, and in some embodiments, from about 1 to about 30 Pa-s, determined at a shear rate of 1000 seconds−1. Melt viscosity may be determined in accordance with ISO Test No. 11443 at a temperature that is 15° C. higher than the melting temperature of the composition (e.g., 350° C.). The composition may also have a relatively high melting temperature. For example, the melting temperature of the polymer may be from about 250° C. to about 400° C., in some embodiments from about 280° C. to about 395° C., and in some embodiments, from about 300° C. to about 380° C. V. Molded Parts Once formed, the polymer composition may be molded into any of a variety of different shaped parts using techniques as is known in the art. For example, the shaped parts may be molded using a one-component injection molding process in which dried and preheated plastic granules are injected into the mold. Regardless of the molding technique employed, it has been discovered that the polymer composition of the present invention, which possesses the unique combination of good antistatic properties, high flowability and good mechanical properties, is particularly well suited for electronic parts having a small dimensional tolerance. Such parts, for example, generally contain at least one micro-sized dimension (e.g., thickness, width, height, etc.), such as from about 500 micrometers or less, in some embodiments from about 50 to about 450 micrometers, and in some embodiments, from about 100 to about 400 micrometers. One such part is a fine pitch electrical connector. More particularly, such electrical connectors are often employed to detachably mount a central processing unit (“CPU”) to a printed circuit board. The connector may contain insertion passageways that are configured to receive contact pins. These passageways are defined by opposing walls, which may be formed from a thermoplastic resin. To help accomplish the desired electrical performance, the pitch of these pins is generally small to accommodate a large number of contact pins required within a given space. This, in turn, requires that the pitch of the pin insertion passageways and the width of opposing walls that partition those passageways are also small. For example, the walls may have a width of from about 500 micrometers or less, in some embodiments from about 50 to about 450 micrometers, and in some embodiments, from about 100 to about 400 micrometers. In the past, it has often been difficult to adequately fill a mold of such a thin width with a thermoplastic resin. Due to its unique properties, however, the polymer composition of the present invention is particularly well suited to form the walls of a fine pitch connector. One particularly suitable fine pitch electrical connector is shown in FIG. 1. An electrical connector 200 is shown that a board-side portion C2 that can be mounted onto the surface of a circuit board P. The connector 200 may also include a wiring material-side portion C1 structured to connect discrete wires 3 to the circuit board P by being coupled to the board-side connector C2. The board-side portion C2 may include a first housing 10 that has a fitting recess 10a into which the wiring material-side connector C1 is fitted and a configuration that is slim and long in the widthwise direction of the housing 10. The wiring material-side portion C1 may likewise include a second housing 20 that is slim and long in the widthwise direction of the housing 20. In the second housing 20, a plurality of terminal-receiving cavities 22 may be provided in parallel in the widthwise direction so as to create a two-tier array including upper and lower terminal-receiving cavities 22. A terminal 5, which is mounted to the distal end of a discrete wire 3, may be received within each of the terminal-receiving cavities 22. If desired, locking portions 28 (engaging portions) may also be provided on the housing 20 that correspond to a connection member (not shown) on the board-side connector C2. As discussed above, the interior walls of the first housing 10 and/or second housing 20 may have a relatively small width dimension, and can be formed from the polymer composition of the present invention. The walls are, for example, shown in more detail in FIG. 2. As illustrated, insertion passageways or spaces 225 are defined between opposing walls 224 that can accommodate contact pins. The walls 224 have a width “w” that is within the ranges noted above. When the walls 224 are formed from a polymer composition containing fibers (e.g., element 400), such fibers may have a volume average length and narrow length distribution within a certain range to best match the width of the walls. For example, the ratio of the width of at least one of the walls to the volume average length of the fibers is from about 0.8 to about 3.2, in some embodiments from about 1.0 to about 3.0, and in some embodiments, from about 1.2 to about 2.9. In addition to or in lieu of the walls, it should also be understood that any other portion of the housing may also be formed from the polymer composition of the present invention. For example, the connector may also include a shield that encloses the housing. Some or all of the shield may be formed from the polymer composition of the present invention. For example, the housing and the shield can each be a one-piece structure unitarily molded from the polymer composition. Likewise, the shield can be a two-piece structure that includes a first shell and a second shell, each of which may be formed from the polymer composition of the present invention. Of course, the polymer composition may also be used in a wide variety of other components. For example, the polymer composition may be molded into a planar substrate for use in an electronic component. The substrate may be thin, such as having a thickness of about 500 micrometers or less, in some embodiments from about 50 to about 450 micrometers, and in some embodiments, from about 100 to about 400 micrometers. In one embodiment, for example, the planar substrate may be applied with one or more conductive elements using a variety of known techniques (e.g., laser direct structuring, electroplating, etc.). The conductive elements may serve a variety of different purposes. In one embodiment, for example, the conductive elements form an integrated circuit, such as those used in SIM cards. In another embodiment, the conductive elements form antennas of a variety of different types, such as antennae with resonating elements that are formed from patch antenna structures, inverted-F antenna structures, closed and open slot antenna structures, loop antenna structures, monopoles, dipoles, planar inverted-F antenna structures, hybrids of these designs, etc. The resulting antenna structures may be incorporated into the housing of a relatively compact portable electronic component, such as described above, in which the available interior space is relatively small. One particularly suitable electronic component that includes an antenna structure is shown in FIGS. 4-5 is a handheld device 410 with cellular telephone capabilities. As shown in FIG. 4, the device 410 may have a housing 412 formed from plastic, metal, other suitable dielectric materials, other suitable conductive materials, or combinations of such materials. A display 414 may be provided on a front surface of the device 410, such as a touch screen display. The device 410 may also have a speaker port 440 and other input-output ports. One or more buttons 438 and other user input devices may be used to gather user input. As shown in FIG. 5, an antenna structure 426 is also provided on a rear surface 442 of device 410, although it should be understood that the antenna structure can generally be positioned at any desired location of the device. As indicated above, the antenna structure 426 may contain a planar substrate that is formed from the polymer composition of the present invention. The antenna structure may be electrically connected to other components within the electronic device using any of a variety of known techniques. For example, the housing 412 or a part of housing 412 may serve as a conductive ground plane for the antenna structure 426. A planar substrate that is formed form the polymer composition of the present invention may also be employed in other applications. For example, in one embodiment, the planar substrate may be used to form a base of a compact camera module (“CCM”), which is commonly employed in wireless communication devices (e.g., cellular phone). Referring to FIGS. 6-7, for example, one particular embodiment of a compact camera module 500 is shown in more detail. As shown, the compact camera module 500 contains a lens assembly 504 that overlies a base 506. The base 506, in turn, overlies an optional main board 508. Due to their relatively thin nature, the base 506 and/or main board 508 are particularly suited to be formed from the polymer composition of the present invention as described above. The lens assembly 504 may have any of a variety of configurations as is known in the art, and may include fixed focus-type lenses and/or auto focus-type lenses. In one embodiment, for example, the lens assembly 504 is in the form of a hollow barrel that houses lenses 604, which are in communication with an image sensor 602 positioned on the main board 508 and controlled by a circuit 601. The barrel may have any of a variety of shapes, such as rectangular, cylindrical, etc. In certain embodiments, the barrel may also be formed from the polymer composition of the present invention and have a wall thickness within the ranges noted above. It should be understood that other parts of the camera module may also be formed from the polymer composition of the present invention. For example, as shown, a polymer film 510 (e.g., polyester film) and/or thermal insulating cap 502 may cover the lens assembly 504. In some embodiments, the film 510 and/or cap 502 may also be formed from the polymer composition of the present invention. Yet other possible electronic components that may employ the polymer composition include, for instance, cellular telephones, laptop computers, small portable computers (e.g., ultraportable computers, netbook computers, and tablet computers), wrist-watch devices, pendant devices, headphone and earpiece devices, media players with wireless communications capabilities, handheld computers (also sometimes called personal digital assistants), remote controllers, global positioning system (GPS) devices, handheld gaming devices, battery covers, speakers, camera modules, integrated circuits (e.g., SIM cards), housings for electronic devices, electrical controls, circuit breakers, switches, power electronics, printer parts, etc. Regardless of the particular manner in which it is employed, the present inventor has discovered that a molded part formed from the polymer composition of the present invention can have excellent mechanical and thermal properties. As indicated above, this is due in part to the unique ability of the ionic liquid to be uniformly blended and dispersed within the polymer matrix. The molded part may, for instance, possess a relatively high impact strength (Charpy notched impact strength), such as about 4 kJ/m2 or more, in some embodiments from about 2 to about 60 kJ/m2, in some embodiments, from about 2 to about 40 kJ/m2, and in some embodiments, from about 3 to about 30 kJ/m2, measured at 23° C. according to ISO Test No. 179-1) (technically equivalent to ASTM 0256, Method B). The tensile and flexural mechanical properties of the part may also be good. For example, the part may exhibit a tensile strength of from about 20 to about 500 MPa, in some embodiments from about 50 to about 400 MPa, and in some embodiments, from about 80 to about 350 MPa; a tensile break strain of about 0.5% or more, in some embodiments from about 0.6% to about 20%, and in some embodiments, from about 0.8% to about 3.5%; and/or a tensile modulus of from about 5,000 MPa to about 30,000 MPa, in some embodiments from about 6,000 MPa to about 20,000 MPa, and in some embodiments, from about 7,000 MPa to about 15,000 MPa. The tensile properties may be determined in accordance with ISO Test No. 527 (technically equivalent to ASTM D638) at 23° C. The molded part may also exhibit a flexural strength of from about 20 to about 500 MPa, in some embodiments from about 50 to about 400 MPa, and in some embodiments, from about 100 to about 350 MPa; a flexural break strain of about 0.5% or more, in some embodiments from about 0.6% to about 20%, and in some embodiments, from about 0.8% to about 3.5%; and/or a flexural modulus of from about 5,000 MPa to about 30,000 MPa, in some embodiments from about 6,000 MPa to about 20,000 MPa, and in some embodiments, from about 7,000 MPa to about 15,000 MPa. The flexural properties may be determined in accordance with ISO Test No. 178 (technically equivalent to ASTM D790) at 23° C. The molded part may also exhibit a deflection temperature under load (DTUL) of about 200° C. or more, and in some embodiments, from about 220° C. to about 280° C., as measured according to ASTM D648-07 (technically equivalent to ISO Test No. 75-2) at a specified load of 1.8 MPa. The molded part may also possess improved flame resistance performance, even in the absence of conventional flame retardants. The flame resistance of the composition may, for instance, be determined in accordance the procedure of Underwriter's Laboratory Bulletin 94 entitled “Tests for Flammability of Plastic Materials, UL94.” Several ratings can be applied based on the time to extinguish (total flame time) and ability to resist dripping as described in more detail below. According to this procedure, for example, a molded part formed from the composition of the present invention may achieve a VO rating, which means that the part has a total flame time of 50 seconds or less and a total number of drips of burning particles that ignite cotton of 0, determined at a given part thickness (e.g., 0.25 or 0.8 mm). For example, when exposed to an open flame, a molded part formed from the composition of the present invention may exhibit a total flame time of about 50 seconds or less, in some embodiments about 45 seconds or less, and in some embodiments, from about 1 to about 40 seconds. Furthermore, the total number of drips of burning particles produced during the UL94 test may be 3 or less, in some embodiments 2 or less, and in some embodiments, 1 or less (e.g., 0). Such testing may be performed after conditioning for 48 hours at 23° C. and 50% relative humidity. The present invention may be better understood with reference to the following examples. Test Methods Antistatic Test: To test for antistatic behavior, molded disks/plaques are gently rubbed against paper to create an electrostatic charge on the molded part surface. The parts are then brought near the small pieces of papers. If an electrostatic charge is created on the part surface, an attractive force between the part and the paper is created. Likewise, if there is no electrostatic charge created, no movement for the paper occurs as the part is moved closer to the paper. If there is movement in the paper, it is recorded as “no” and if there is no movement in the paper, then it is recorded as “yes.” Melt Viscosity: The melt viscosity (Pa-s) may be determined in accordance with ISO Test No. 11443 at a shear rate of 1000 s−1 and temperature 15° C. above the melting temperature (e.g., 350° C.) using a Dynisco LCR7001 capillary rheometer. The rheometer orifice (die) had a diameter of 1 mm, length of 20 mm, L/D ratio of 20.1, and an entrance angle of 180°. The diameter of the barrel was 9.55 mm+0.005 mm and the length of the rod was 233.4 mm. Melting Temperature: The melting temperature (“Tm”) of a polymer or composition may be determined by differential scanning calorimetry (“DSC”) as is known in the art. The melting temperature is the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) peak melt temperature as determined by ISO Test No. 11357. Under the DSC procedure, samples were heated and cooled at 20° C. per minute as stated in ISO Standard 10350 using DSC measurements conducted on a TA Q2000 Instrument. Deflection Temperature Under Load (“DTUL”): The deflection under load temperature may be determined in accordance with ISO Test No. 75-2 (technically equivalent to ASTM D648-07). More particularly, a test strip sample having a length of 80 mm, thickness of 10 mm, and width of 4 mm may be subjected to an edgewise three-point bending test in which the specified load (maximum outer fibers stress) was 1.8 Megapascals. The specimen may be lowered into a silicone oil bath where the temperature is raised at 2° C. per minute until it deflects 0.25 mm (0.32 mm for ISO Test No. 75-2). Tensile Modulus, Tensile Stress, and Tensile Elongation: Tensile properties may be tested according to ISO Test No. 527 (technically equivalent to ASTM D638). Modulus and strength measurements may be made on the same test strip sample having a length of 80 mm, thickness of 10 mm, and width of 4 mm. The testing temperature may be 23° C., and the testing speeds may be 1 or 5 mm/min. Flexural Modulus, Flexural Stress, and Flexural Strain: Flexural properties may be tested according to ISO Test No. 178 (technically equivalent to ASTM D790). This test may be performed on a 64 mm support span. Tests may be run on the center portions of uncut ISO 3167 multi-purpose bars. The testing temperature may be 23° C. and the testing speed may be 2 mm/min. Notched Charpy Impact Strength: Notched Charpy properties may be tested according to ISO Test No. ISO 179-1) (technically equivalent to ASTM D256, Method B), This test may be run using a Type A notch (0.25 mm base radius) and Type 1 specimen size (length of 80 mm, width of 10 mm, and thickness of 4 mm). Specimens may be cut from the center of a multi-purpose bar using a single tooth milling machine. The testing temperature may be 23° C. Surface Resistivity and Volume Resistivity: The surface and volume resistivity values may be determined in accordance with IEC 60093 (similar to ASTM D257-07), The test may be performed using a 60×60 mm plaque. The test may employ a voltmeter-ammeter method using an electrometer (Keithley K8009 or ETS 823). When tested with the Keithley K-8009, a four minute discharge time and a one minute electrification may be used. When tested using the ETS-823 probe, readings may be taken immediately upon stabilization. UL94: A specimen is supported in a vertical position and a flame is applied to the bottom of the specimen. The flame is applied for ten (10) seconds and then removed until flaming stops, at which time the flame is reapplied for another ten (10) seconds and then removed. Two (2) sets of five (5) specimens are tested. The sample size is a length of 125 mm, width of 13 mm, and thickness of 0.8 mm. The two sets are conditioned before and after aging. For unaged testing, each thickness is tested after conditioning for 48 hours at 23° C. and 50% relative humidity. For aged testing, five (5) samples of each thickness are tested after conditioning for 7 days at 70° C.
