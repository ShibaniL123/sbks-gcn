CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/737,999 filed Dec. 17, 2012, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. FIELD This disclosure herein relates to compositions and methods for mTOR hyperactive related diseases and disorders such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and lymphangioleiomyomatosis in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC/LAM). BACKGROUND The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway is a major player controlling cell growth and cell division. The kinase, mTOR, is a master regulator of protein synthesis that couples nutrient sensing to cell growth. Defects in the mTOR signalling pathway can result in loss of control in cell growth and cell division. For example, two proteins, hamartin and tuberin, are known to be involved in the control of cell growth and cell division via their effects on the mTOR signaling pathway. Hamartin and tuberin function as a complex to interact with Rheb GTPase, thereby sequestering it from activating mTOR signaling. Mutations at the TSC1 and TSC2 loci which codes for hamartin and tuberin respectively result in the deregulation of the mTOR signalling pathway resulting in an increased in mTOR signaling. This is turn leads to a loss of control of cell growth and cell division, and subsequently a predisposition to forming tumors. There are a number of medical conditions that are associated with the deregulation of the mTOR signalling pathway. For example, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). LAM is a rare lung disease that is associated with mutations in the TSC2 locus. It is characterized by the proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle-like cells throughout the lungs, in the bronchioles, alveolar septa, perivascular spaces, and lymphatics, resulting in the obstruction of small airways (leading to pulmonary cyst formation and pneumothorax) and lymphatics (leading to chylous pleural effusion). LAM occurs almost exclusively in women, usually of childbearing age. There are two types of LAM, sporadic LAM and LAM/TSC which in LAM that frequently occurs in patients who have TSC. The clinical course of patients with LAM can shows considerable variation. The disease can progressive slowly, but ultimately leads to respiratory failure and death. The 10-year survival from the start of symptoms has been reported to range from 47-79% depending on the various studies. There are currently no good treatment options for LAM. Current treatment used include administration of rapamycin (also known as sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor) for shrinking tumors, and therapies targeting the reproductive cycle of the women, e.g., progesterone, oophorectomy, tamoxifen, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or analogues and androgen therapy. TSC is a rare multi-system genetic disease that results in non-malignant tumors to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, brain, and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, lung and kidney disease. TSC is caused by a mutation of either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2. High percentages (60-80%) of TSC patients have benign tumors in the kidneys called angiomyolipomas (AML) which frequently causing hematuria. These tumors are composed of vascular tissue (angio-), smooth muscle (-myo-), and fat (-lipoma). Although benign, AML may grow such that kidney function is impaired or the blood vessels may dilate and burst leading to catastrophic hemorrhage either spontaneously or with minimal trauma. Large AML can be treated with embolization. In addition, TSC patients who have AML are predisposed to develop LAM in the lungs. The proliferating smooth muscle that occurs in the type of LAM seen in these patients (TSC-LAM) has been shown to represent clones of the smooth muscle in those patients' renal AML. It is believed to represent metastases of this “benign” tumor. Leading causes of death in TSC patients include renal disease, brain tumor, LAM of the lung, and status epilepticus or bronchopneumonia in those with severe mental handicap. There is no current effective treatment for TSC or the consequential AML or LAM; treatment is mainly symptomatic management, e.g., everolimus (derivative of rapamycin) for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (brain tumor), vigabatrin for infantile spasm, ACTH for epilepsy and rapamycin for shrinking the tumors. Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a naturally occurring macrolide that inhibits mTORC1 activity and is effective in shrinking kidney AML in TSC and LAM patients. However, upon discontinuation of treatment, the lesions regrow to their original size, suggesting that rapamycin has primarily cytostatic effects on TSC-deficient tumors. The mechanisms through which tumors regrow after rapamycin was discontinued are not well understood. SUMMARY Embodiments disclosed herein are based on the discovery that combination therapies comprising rapamycin with certain known drugs were more effective at inducing cell death in TSC2-null lymphangioleiomyomatosis-derived (LAM) cells than single drug therapy. SCH-202676 hydrobromide, danusertib (PHA-739358), AZ-960, nicardipine, SB-590885, Thimerosal, ionomycin, U-73343, PAF C16, BX912, and Chlorambucil each worked synergistically with rapamycin to bring about effective apoptosis. Accordingly, combination therapies comprising rapamycin and these drugs can be used to induce apoptosis when desired, for example, in cancer and tumor treatment, when there is a desire to kill cancer cells that have mutations in the TSC1 and/or TSC2 loci, and/or kill cancer cells that have deregulated mTOR signaling or mTOR hyperactivity. In addition, compounds were screened for cytotoxic or anti-proliferative activity in cells lacking TSC2. Compounds that were more cytotoxic or anti-proliferative in the absence of rapamycin pretreatment were selected for further study. Since rapamycin is a selective inhibitor of mTOR the assumption can be made that the cytotoxic or anti-proliferative activity of these compounds requires an active or hyperactive mTOR pathway. This raises the possibility that these compounds will exhibit a wide therapeutic index due to the selectively high mTOR pathway activity in TSC, LAM and certain cancers, compared to normal tissues. These “synthetic lethal” compounds include flupentixol, fluphenazine, mephenytoin, aminoglutethimide, betaxolol hydrochloride, salmeterol, chelerythrine chloride, paroxetine, trifluoperazine, fluoxetine, methiothepin, nortriptyline, and A-77636. These compounds were surprisingly effective at inducing cell death in TSC2-null LAM cells when used individually in the absence of rapamycin. Therefore, flupentixol, fluphenazine, mephenytoin, aminoglutethimide, betaxolol hydrochloride, salmeterol, chelerythrine chloride, paroxetine, trifluoperazine, fluoxetine, methiothepin, nortriptyline, and A-77636, previously developed for certain neurological and cardiovascular conditions, represent additional therapeutics for inducing apoptosis when desired. In some embodiments, least one compound selected from the group consisting of flupentixol, fluphenazine, mephenytoin, aminoglutethimide, betaxolol hydrochloride, salmeterol, chelerythrine chloride and A-77636 can be used in the embodiments described herein. Accordingly, in one embodiment, it is the objective of this disclosure to provide additional cancer or anti-tumor therapeutics to the existing repertoire of cancer/anti-tumor therapies currently available. In some embodiments, the cancers are associated with mutations in the TSC1 and/or TSC2 loci, and/or have deregulated mTOR signaling or mTOR hyperactivity. In one embodiment, the deregulated mTOR signaling results in mTOR hyperactivity.

In one embodiment of any of the method or composition described derivatives or analogues of the known drugs/compounds are included. Definitions As used herein, the term “comprising” or “comprises” is used in reference to methods, compositions and respective component(s) thereof, that are essential to the claims, yet open to the inclusion of unspecified elements, whether essential or not. The use of “comprising” indicates inclusion rather than limitation. The term “consisting of” refers to methods, compositions and respective components thereof as described herein, which are exclusive of any element not recited in that description of the embodiment. As used herein, the term “apoptosis” refers to a natural process of self-destruction in certain cells that is determined by the genes and can be initiated by an external stimulus e.g., rapamycin. Several biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death.

Analysis of apoptosis can be performed by any method known in the art, non-limiting examples include cell free apoptotic assay, DNA fragmentation assay, DNA laddering assay, terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and Annexin A5 (or annexin V) detection. The DNA can be labeled with propidium iodide or 7-AAD and analysed by flow cytometry. A “cancer” in a subject refers to the presence of cells possessing characteristics typical of cancer-causing cells, such as uncontrolled proliferation, immortality, metastatic potential, rapid growth and proliferation rate, loss of contact inhibition and certain characteristic morphological features. Often, cancer cells will be in the form of a tumor, but such cells may exist alone within a subject, or may be a non-tumorigenic cancer cell, such as a leukemia cell. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to breast cancer, a melanoma, adrenal gland cancer, biliary tract cancer, bladder cancer, brain or central nervous system cancer, bronchus cancer, blastoma, carcinoma, a chondrosarcoma, cancer of the oral cavity or pharynx, cervical cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, glioblastoma, hepatic carcinoma, hepatoma, kidney cancer, leukemia, liver cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreas cancer, peripheral nervous system cancer, prostate cancer, sarcoma, salivary gland cancer, small bowel or appendix cancer, small-cell lung cancer, squamous cell cancer, stomach cancer, testis cancer, thyroid cancer, urinary bladder cancer, uterine or endometrial cancer, and vulval cancer. As used herein, the term “tumor” means a mass of transformed cells that are characterized by neoplastic uncontrolled cell multiplication and at least in part, by containing angiogenic vasculature. The abnormal neoplastic cell growth is rapid and continues even after the stimuli that initiated the new growth has ceased. The term “tumor” is used broadly to include the tumor parenchymal cells as well as the supporting stroma, including the angiogenic blood vessels that infiltrate the tumor parenchymal cell mass. Although a tumor generally is a malignant tumor, i.e., a cancer having the ability to metastasize (i.e. a metastatic tumor), a tumor also can be nonmalignant (i.e. non-metastatic tumor). Tumors are hallmarks of cancer, a neoplastic disease the natural course of which is fatal. Cancer cells exhibit the properties of invasion and metastasis and are highly anaplastic. As used herein, the term “cancer therapy” refers to a therapy useful in treating cancer. In some embodiments, the cancer therapy involves the use of anti-cancer therapeutic agents and medical procedures. Non-limiting examples of cancer therapy and anti-cancer therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, e.g., surgery, chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapy, growth inhibitory agents, cytotoxic agents, agents used in radiation therapy, anti-angiogenesis agents, apoptotic agents, anti-tubulin agents, and other agents to treat cancer, such as anti-HER-2 antibodies (e.g., HERCEPTIN), anti-CD20 antibodies, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist (e.g., a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), HER1/EGFR inhibitor (e.g., erlotinib (TARCEVA)), platelet derived growth factor inhibitors (e.g., GLEEVEC™ (Imatinib Mesylate)), a COX-2 inhibitor (e.g., celecoxib), interferons, cytokines, antagonists (e.g., neutralizing antibodies) that bind to one or more of the following targets ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, PDGFR-beta, BlyS, APRIL, BCMA or VEGF receptor(s), TRAIL/Apo2, and other bioactive and organic chemical agents, etc. Combinations thereof are also contemplated for use with the methods described herein. In one embodiment, “administration,” “treating,” and “treatment,” as it applies to a subject, refers to the contact of an exogenous pharmaceutical, a drug, a compound, a therapeutic, or a composition to the subject. In another embodiment, “administration,” “treating,” and “treatment,” as it applies to a subject, refers to the contact of any one of the described compounds or compositions to the subject. For example, contacting of rapamycin and SCH-202676 with the subject. Alternatively, the terms “administering,” refers to the placement of a compound, a combination of compound, or a composition described herein for intended purposes such as treating cancer, inhibiting cell growth, killing cells or inducing apoptosis, into a subject by a method or route which results in at least partial localization of the compound, the combination of compound, or the composition respectively at a desired site, i.e., cancer cells, tumor cells, tumor cells with TSC mutation(s) and/or mTOR hyperactivity in the subject. The compound, the combination of compound, or the composition described herein can be administered by any appropriate route which results in an effective treatment in the subject, i.e. administration results in delivery to a desired location (e.g., directly to a tumor or near a tumor) in the subject where at least a portion of the composition delivered. The period of time the compound, the combination of compound, or the composition is active depends on the half-life in vivo after administration to a subject, and can be as short as a few hours, e. g. twenty-four hours, to a few days, to as long as several years. Modes of administration include injection, infusion, instillation, suppository (e.g., for vaginal, cervical. rectal or urethral insertion), percutaneous implantation or ingestion. “Injection” includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intraventricular, intradermal, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, subcuticular injection and infusion. In one embodiment, as used herein, the term “treat' or treatment” refers to reducing or alleviating at least one adverse clinical symptom associated with cancer, e.g., pain, swelling, low blood count etc. In another embodiment, the term “treat' or treatment” refers to slowing or reversing the progression neoplastic uncontrolled cell multiplication, i.e. shrinking existing tumors and/or halting tumor growth. In another embodiment, the term “treat” or “treatment” refers to inducing apoptosis in cancer or tumor cells in the subject. In one embodiment, as used herein, the term “prevention” or “preventing” when used in the context of a subject refers to stopping, hindering, and/or slowing down the development of tumors and symptoms associated with aberrant formation of such tumor. As used herein, the term “a therapeutically effective amount” or “an effective amount” refers to an amount sufficient to achieve the intended purposes such as treating cancer, inhibiting cell growth, killing cells or inducing apoptosis. In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound, a combination of compound, or a composition described herein for a method of treating cancer or TSC is an amount of sufficient to induce apoptosis of cancer cells of the subject as compared to in the absent of the compound, the combination of compound, a composition respectively. In other embodiments, the amount that is safe and sufficient to treat, delay the development of a tumor, and/or delay further growth of the tumor. In some embodiments, the amount can thus cure or result in amelioration of the symptoms of cancer and tumor growth, slow the course of cancer progression, slow or inhibit a symptom of cancer, slow or inhibit the establishment of secondary symptoms of cancer or inhibit the development of a secondary symptom of the cancer. For example, an effective amount of a compound, a combination of compound, or a composition described herein can inhibits tumor (e.g., LAM or AML) further growth, cause a reduction in size or even completely halt tumor growth, shrink the sizes of tumor, even complete regression of tumor, and reduce clinical symptoms associated with tumor. In one embodiment, an effective amount for treating cancer or TSC is an amount of a compound, a combination of compound, or a composition described herein sufficient to result in a reduction or complete removal of the symptoms of the disorder, disease, or medical condition. In another embodiment, an effective amount for treating or ameliorating a disorder, disease, or medical condition is an amount sufficient to result in a reduction or complete removal of the symptoms of the disorder, disease, or medical condition. The effective amount of a given therapeutic agent will vary with factors such as the nature of the agent, the route of administration, the size and species of the animal to receive the therapeutic agent, and the purpose of the administration. Thus, it is not possible or prudent to specify an exact “therapeutically effective amount”. However, for any given case, an appropriate “effective amount” can be determined by a skilled artisan according to established methods in the art using only routine experimentation. Derivatives, as used herein, include a chemically modified compound wherein the modification is considered routine by the ordinary skilled chemist, such as additional chemical moieties (e.g., an ester or an amide of an acid, protecting groups, such as a benzyl group for an alcohol or thiol, and tert-butoxycarbonyl group for an amine). Derivatives also include radioactively labeled of the compounds described herein (e.g., biotin or avidin, with enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase and the like, with bioluminescent agents, chemoluminescent agents or fluorescent agents). Additionally, moieties may be added to the compounds described herein or a portion thereof to increase half-life in vivo.

As used herein, the term “mTOR deregulation” with respect to cancer cells or cells with neoplasia refers to increased or decreased signaling of the mTOR pathway compared to normal cells or cells without neoplasia. Increased or decreased signaling can be analyzed by any method known in the art, e.g., by monitoring the corresponding increase or decrease phosphorylation of the mTOR downstream effectors molecules S6K1 and 4E-BP1. See L. Yan, 2006 J. Biol. Chem., 281: 19793-19797. As used herein, the term “mTOR hyperactivation” with respect to cancer cells or cells with neoplasia refers to increased signaling of the mTOR pathway compared to normal cells or cells without neoplasia. Increased mTOR signaling can be analyzed by any method known in the art, e.g., by monitoring the increase phosphorylation of the mTOR downstream effectors molecules S6K1 and 4E-BP1. See L. Yan, 2006 J. Biol. Chem., 281: 19793-19797. As used herein, the term “neoplasia” refers to the abnormal proliferation of benign or malignant cells. The terms “decrease”, “reduced”, “reduction”, or “inhibit” are all used herein to mean a decrease by a statistically significant amount. In some embodiments, “reduce,” “reduction” or “decrease” or “inhibit” typically means a decrease by at least 10% as compared to a reference level (e.g. the absence of a given treatment) and can include, for example, a decrease by at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 98%, at least about 99% , or more.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows the rapamycin does not induce cell death in 621-101 cells that are derived from a patient having LAM, the cells are TSC2-null. FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of an experimental design of a large scale screen for drugs that induces or promotes apoptosis in 621-101 cells. FIG. 3 shows an exemplary result of a high-throughput screen identifying potential novel therapies for LAM, TSC and mTOR hyperactive cells. 621-101 cells (TSC2-null, derived from a LAM patient) were screened for compounds that “synergize” with rapamycin to cause cell death. Four compounds, danusertib, AZ960, SCH202676 hydrobromide, and SB590885, were confirmed as hits. Interestingly, we also found one compound, chelerythrine chloride, which was protected by rapamycin and may be used as a single agent therapy. Rapamycin was used at 20 nM and the screen compounds at 20 uM. FIG. 4 shows that chelerythrine chloride inhibits 621-101 cell proliferation at 24 h post drug exposure. This effect on cells is reduced when treated in combination with rapamycin. 621-101 cells were pretreated for two hours with either DMSO (top two panels) or rapamycin (20 nM) bottom two panels) followed by the addition of fresh DMSO (top left), fresh rapamycin (bottom left), chelerythrine chloride (1 uM, top right), or rapamycin and chelerythrine chloride (bottom right). As shown, chelerythrine chloride treatment has a dramatic effect on the 621-101 cells (top right) and this effect is protected with rapamycin treatment (bottom right). This suggests that chelerythrine chloride is a potential single agent therapy. 4× magnification. FIG. 5 shows that chelerythrine chloride inhibits 621-101 cell proliferation at 96 h post drug exposure. FIG. 6 shows that chelerythrine chloride is selective to Tsc2-null cells. Tsc2-null (bottom two panels) and wild-type (top two panels) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were treated with chelerythrine chloride for 30 hours at 10 uM. chelerythrine chloride has a minimal effect on the wild-type MEFs (compare top left—wildtype cells treated with DMSO to top right wildtype cells treated with chelerythrine chloride), however, it has a dramatic effect on the Tsc-null MEFS (compare bottom left—Tsc2-null cells treated with DMSO to bottom right Tsc2-null cells treated with chelerythrine chloride). 10× magnification. FIG. 7 shows that paroxetine (Paxil, labeled herein as compound 2) is selective to Tsc2-null cells. Mouse TSC2-deficient uterine leiomyoma cells derived from the Eker rat model of TSC, ELT3-V3 (TSC2-deficient) and ELT3-T3 (re-expressing TSC2) were treated with 10 mM of DMSO or Paxil for 24 hrs. The ELT3-V3 (TSC2-deficient) were susceptible to Paxil induced apoptosis after 24 hrs.

It should be understood that this technology is not limited to the particular methodology, protocols, and reagents, etc., described herein and as such may vary. The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present technology, which is defined solely by the claims. Other than in the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients or reaction conditions used herein should be understood as modified in all instances by the term “about.” The term “about” when used in connection with percentages will mean ±1%. All patents and publications identified are expressly incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing, for example, the methodologies described in such publications that might be used in connection with the present technology. These publications are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing in this regard should be construed as an admission that the inventors are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention or for any other reason. All statements as to the date or representation as to the contents of these documents is based on the information available to the applicants and does not constitute any admission as to the correctness of the dates or contents of these documents. Embodiments disclosed herein are based on the discovery that combinations of rapamycin with certain known drugs were more effective at inducing cell death in TSC2-null lymphangioleiomyomatosis-derived (LAM) cells than the drugs alone. Rapamycin worked synergistically with SCH-202676 hydrobromide, danusertib (PHA-739358), AZ-960, nicardipine, SB-590885, Thimerosal, ionomycin, U-73343, PAF C16, BX912, and/or Chlorambucil. to effectively induce apoptosis. Accordingly, combination therapies comprising rapamycin and one or more of these drugs/compounds are useful for inducing apoptosis when desired. For example, in cancer treatment and shrinking tumor size, there is a desire to kill the cancer/tumor cells. Alternatively, there is a desire to kill cancer cells when the cancer cells are associated with genetic mutations at the TSC1 and TSC2 loci, or when the cancer cells have deregulated mTOR signaling or mTOR hyperactivity. In addition, several other known drugs used for the treatment of neurological and cardiovascular conditions were also more effective at inducing cell death in TSC2-null LAM cells in the absence of rapamycin. The drugs are flupentixol, fluphenazine, mephenytoin, aminoglutethimide, betaxolol hydrochloride, salmeterol, chelerythrine chloride, paroxetine, trifluoperazine, fluoxetine, methiothepin, nortriptyline, and A-77636 Therefore, these known drugs represent additional therapeutics for inducing apoptosis when desired.

The mTOR signalling pathway is a major player controlling cell growth and cell division. Cancers associated with genetic defects often have aberrant mTOR signaling. The inventors here show that known drugs are effective at inducing apoptosis in LAM cells with having TSC mutations. LAM is caused by mutations in TSC2, which encodes the protein tuberin (TSC2). The TSC1/TSC2 heterodimer, through inhibition of the Ras homolog enriched in the brain protein (Rheb), negatively regulates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (TORC1). Therefore, LAM patient lesions have hyperactivation of TORC1. Rapamycin is a naturally occurring macrolide that inhibits TORC1 actively and is effective in shrinking kidney angio myolipomas (AML). Therefore, the known drugs are also effective at inducing apoptosis in cells having deregulated mTOR pathway signalling, and mTOR hyperactivity. Accordingly, in one embodiment of any method described, the contacted cell or cancer to be treated involves mutations in at least one of the TSC loci. In one embodiment, the mutation is at the TSC1 locus. In another embodiment, the mutation is at the TSC2 locus. In another embodiment, the mutation is at both the TSC1 and TSC2 loci. In one embodiment of any method described, the contacted cell or the cancer to be treated involves mTOR deregulation or hyperactivity. In one embodiment, the mTOR deregulation results in mTOR hyperactivity. In one embodiment of any method, the mTOR hyperactivity is at least 10% higher compared to a control mTOR activity level. In other embodiments, the mTOR hyperactivity is at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99%, at least 100% over the mTOR control. In one embodiment of any method, the mTOR control is an mTOR activity level in a population of normal non-cancer cells from the subject being treated. In another embodiment, the mTOR control is an average mTOR activity level in a population of healthy subjects. For example, normal non-cancer cells can be taken from the subject being treated and analyzed for the cellular mTOR activity level. The normal non-cancer cells can be taken from the same organ diagnosed with cancer or tumors, or the normal non-cancer cells can be taken from other healthy organs that are free from cancer or tumors in the subject to be treated. Alternatively, healthy cells can be collected from a population of healthy subjects, e.g., human subjects, the mTOR activity for the cells of each subject is analyzed and the average mTOR activity is calculated. The healthy cells collected from the healthy subjects can be from the same organ where cancer or tumors are diagnosed in the subject being treated. Alternatively, the healthy cells can come from a variety of tissue types in a subject. For analyzing TSC mutation and/or mTOR activity, a tissue sample is collected from the subject to be treated or healthy volunteer subjects. Cancer cells can be obtained from a subject diagnosed with or suspected of having cancer and/or tumors. For example, cancer cells can be obtained from a tissue biopsy or an excised tumor during a routine surgery to remove cancerous tumors. During the biopsy, healthy, normal non-cancer cells can be taken for analyzing the control cellular mTOR level. A skilled physician or surgeon will be able to obtain a tissue biopsy or excised a tumor from a subject. Alternatively, for TSC gene analysis, a sample of blood from the subject can be used. In one embodiment, the tissue sample is a tumor sample. In another embodiment, the tissue sample contains cancerous cells. As used herein, a “tissue sample” refers to a portion, piece, part, segment, or fraction of a tissue which is obtained or removed from an intact tissue of a subject, preferably a human subject. In one embodiment, the tissue sample is a blood sample. In another embodiment, the tissue sample is a bone marrow sample. In one embodiment, the tissue sample is a cerebrospinal fluid sample. As used herein, a “tumor sample” refers to a portion, piece, part, segment, or fraction of a tumor, for example, a tumor which is obtained or removed from a subject (e.g., removed or extracted from a tissue of a subject), preferably a human subject. In one embodiment, the tissue sample is obtained from a biopsy procedure in the subject. In another embodiment, the tissue sample is obtained from a surgical procedure to remove a tumor mass from the subject. The cellular mTOR activity level of cancer cell and normal non-cancer cells can be analyzed by any method known in the art, For example, as described by Ikenoue T. et a., Methods Enzymol. 2009; 452:165-80; and by Jinhee Kim, et al., Methods in Molecular Biology; 2012; 821:215-225. These references are incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the cellular mTOR activity level can be determined by using any one of the commercially available kits following the manufacturer's protocol. For example, the K-LISA™ mTOR Activity Kit by Merck Millipore Catalogs #CBA055 and CBA104). For TSC loci gene analysis, the mutations in the TSC loci can be analyzed by any known genomic method in the art. For example, by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) coupled with DNA sequencing as described by Galina D. et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med.; 2001; 163:253-258; Hornigold N, et al., Oncogene; 1999; 18:2657-2661. Briefly, the coding exons of TSC1 or 2 are amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the amplified PCR products are then analysed for variation on DNA gels without glycerol and with 5% glycerol. As a good number of TSC loci mutations result in chain-terminating, quantitative real-time (RT-PCR) assays can be used to analyze the amount of TSC1/2 mRNA as described in Kwiatkowska J. et al., Ann Hum Genet. 1998; 62:277-85. Alternatively, commercial kits are available, e.g., RT2 qPCR Primer Assay for Human TSC1 and TSC2 respectively from SABIOSCIENCES™ catalog #PPH00244B-200 and PPH00245F. The PCR primers for the human TSC1 and TSC2 can be purchased from BIORAD.

Formulation and Application In one embodiment, the compounds or combination of compounds are delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. Specifically, it refers to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. The term “carrier” refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations, and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed. (Mack Publishing Co., 1990). The formulation should suit the mode of administration. Additional carrier agents, such as liposomes, can be added to the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Therapeutic compositions contain a physiologically tolerable carrier together with at least a compound or combination of compounds compounds or combination of compounds as described herein, dissolved or dispersed therein as an active ingredient. In one embodiment, the therapeutic composition is not immunogenic when administered to a mammal or human patient for therapeutic purposes. As used herein, the terms “pharmaceutically acceptable”, “physiologically tolerable” and grammatical variations thereof, as they refer to compositions, carriers, diluents and reagents, are used interchangeably and represent that the materials are capable of administration to or upon a mammal without the production of undesirable physiological effects such as nausea, dizziness, gastric upset and the like. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier will not promote the raising of an immune response to an agent with which it is admixed, unless so desired. The preparation of a pharmacological composition that contains active ingredients dissolved or dispersed therein is well understood in the art and need not be limited based on formulation. Compositions can be prepared as injectable either as liquid solutions or suspensions, however, solid forms suitable for solution, or suspensions; in liquid prior to use can also be prepared. The preparation can also be emulsified or presented as a liposome composition. The compounds or combination of compounds can also be conjugated with lipids, e.g., amphipathic lipids, for stability and delivery purposes. The conjugation bonds are reversible and are broken or dissolved when the compounds or combination of compounds are delivered to target destination. Alternatively, the compounds or combination of compounds described herein can be prepared as a solid or semi-solid or emulsion in suppository, e.g., as microspheres. The microspheres can be inserted as a solid into or targeted to a solid tumor. The compounds or combination of compounds described herein can be mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient and in amounts suitable for use in the therapeutic methods described herein. Specifically contemplated pharmaceutical compositions are compounds or combination of compounds in a preparation for delivery as described herein above, or in references cited and incorporated herein in that section. Suitable excipients include, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol or the like and combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the composition can contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like which enhance the effectiveness of the active ingredient. The therapeutic composition comprising the compounds or combination of compounds described herein can include pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the components therein. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide) that are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, tartaric, mandelic and the like. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine and the like. Physiologically tolerable carriers are well known in the art. Exemplary liquid carriers are sterile aqueous solutions that contain no materials in addition to the active ingredients and water, or contain a buffer such as sodium phosphate at physiological pH value, physiological saline or both, such as phosphate-buffered saline. Still further, aqueous carriers can contain more than one buffer salt, as well as salts such as sodium and potassium chlorides, dextrose, polyethylene glycol and other solutes. Liquid compositions can also contain liquid phases in addition to and to the exclusion of water. Exemplary of such additional liquid phases are glycerin, vegetable oils such as cottonseed oil, and water-oil emulsions. The amount of compounds or combination of compounds or composition used in the methods described herein that will be effective in the treatment of a particular disorder or condition will depend on the nature of the disorder or condition, and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. Routes of administration include, but are not limited to, direct injection, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intrauterine and oral routes. The compounds or combination of compounds or compositions described herein can be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion, intravenous injection, suppository or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. The precise dose and formulation to be employed depends upon the potency of the compounds or combination of compounds described herein, and depends on the amounts large enough to produce the desired effect, e.g., a reduction in size and/or growth of the tumors in the subject. The dosage should not be so large as to cause unacceptable adverse side effects. Generally, the dosage will vary with the type compounds or combination of compounds, and with the age, condition, and size of the tumors in the subject are also considered. Dosage and formulation of the compounds or combination of compounds will also depend on the route of administration, and the mass and number of tumors in the subject, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each subject's circumstances. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. The dosage can be determined by one of skill in the art and can also be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication. Typically, the dosage ranges from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight. In some embodiments, the dosage range is from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 1 g/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 0.5 g/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 0.1 g/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 50 mg/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 25 mg/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 10 mg/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 5 mg/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 1 mg/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 0.1 mg/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 0.005 mg/kg body weight. Alternatively, in some embodiments the dosage range is from 0.1 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 0.5 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 1 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 1.5 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 2 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 2.5 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 3 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 3.5 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 4 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 4.5 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 4.8 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight. In one embodiment, the dose range is from 5 g/kg body weight to 30 g/kg body weight. Alternatively, the dose range will be titrated to maintain serum levels between 5 g/mL and 30 g/mL. Administration of the doses recited above can be repeated for a limited period of time. In some embodiments, the doses are given once a day, or multiple times a day, for example but not limited to three times a day. In one embodiment, the doses recited above are administered daily for several weeks or months. The duration of treatment depends upon the subject's clinical progress and responsiveness to therapy, e.g., shrinkage of tumor sizes. Continuous, relatively low maintenance doses are contemplated after an initial higher therapeutic dose. As exemplary, the compounds or combination of compounds and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be formulated for direct application by injection into the tumor in the subject. Efficacy testing can be performed during the course of treatment using the methods described herein, e.g., ultrasound, MRI and CT to monitor the shrinkage in size of the tumors in the treated subject. A decrease in size of the tumors during and after treatment indicates that the treatment is effective in reducing tumor size. Measurements of the degree of severity of a number of symptoms associated with cancerous tumors are also noted prior to the start of a treatment and then at later specific time period after the start of the treatment. A skilled physician will be able to ascertain the tumor sizes and related symptoms by known methods in the art and those described herein.

EXAMPLE Methods The screen is being performed in 621-101 cells (which are derived from an angiomyolipoma (AML) of a patient with LAM and have a bi-allelic TSC2 inactivating mutation). The 621-101 cells are plated at 1250 cells/well in 384-well plates and grown overnight. Cells are then pretreated with either Rapamycin (20 nM) or DMSO control in duplicate for two hours. Compound libraries are then added at the ICCB and allowed to incubate for 48-72 h. ATP levels (CELLTITER GLO assay, Promega) are being used as an indicator of cell viability. Treatment with staurosporine (1-2 uM) represents a positive control for cell death. Results: The inventors screened the Known Bioactives Collection at the ICCB which consists of approximately 7,000 compounds. Our screen identified and confirmed 5 compounds that synergize with Rapamycin to significantly decrease ATP levels compared to compound treatment alone. We have also identified a group of compounds that are more efficacious alone than in combination with Rapamycin treatment (have the potential to be utilized as single agents). Conclusions: The data indicate that potential therapies for LAM, including compounds that synergize with Rapamycin, can be identified via high-throughput drug screening. The references cited herein and throughout the specification are incorporated herein by reference.
