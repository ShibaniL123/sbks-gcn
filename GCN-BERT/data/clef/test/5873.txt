Step 4 : preparation of intermediate tert butyl (2S,4S,5S)-5-(allyloxyamino)-4-[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxy-2-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]piperidine-1-carboxylate (4d)
To a solution of tert-butyl (2S,4S,5S)-5-(allyloxyamino)-2-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-4-hydroxy-piperidine-1-carboxylate (4c) (2.63 g, 6.32 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (25 mL) under inert atmosphere at 0°C was added 2,6-lutidine (0.883 mL, 7.58 mmol) followed by TBDMSOTf (1.52 mL, 6.64 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 2 h at 20°C and then the solution was extracted with DCM, washed with saturated sodium hydrogencarbonate aqueous solution. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated. The product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (cyclohexane/EtOAc: gradient 99/1 to 90/10) to afford tert-butyl (2S,4S,5S)-5-(allyloxyamino)-4-[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxy-2-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl] piperidine-1-carboxylate (4d) (2.92 g, 5.50 mmol, 87%) as a colorless oil.
