BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As the present trend in tire-making technology continues toward the use of higher silica loadings in rubber compounds, there is a challenge to contain levels of environmentally released volatile organic compounds (VOC), especially alcohol, during compounding, processing, cure and storage of silica-reinforced rubbers. In US 2006/217473 A1 we described the preparation of alkoxy-modified silsesquioxane (AMS) compounds and co-alkoxy-modified silsesquioxane (co-AMS) compounds that generate less alcohol than conventional alkoxysilane-containing silica-coupling and/or silica dispersing agents used in rubber compounding. In addition to improved environmental conditions in the plant, the decreased amount of alcohol produced when using the AMS and co-AMS compounds results in vulcanized rubber compounds having one or more improved properties such as enhanced rubber reinforcement, increased polymer-filler interaction and lower compound viscosity, providing for tires having improved wet and snow traction, lower rolling resistance, increased rebound and decreased hysteresis. In the aforementioned patent application, we described AMS and co-AMS compounds that can be made by subjecting one or more trialkoxysilanes or trichlorosilanes to hydrolysis and condensation in an aqueous alcohol solution in the presence of a hydrolysis and condensation catalyst such as a strong acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid), a strong base (e.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide), a strong organic acid, and a strong organic base (e.g. hindered amine bases or guanidines). The AMS or co-AMS product can be removed from the reaction mixture, such as by phase separation, filtration, and/or extraction with water and an organic solvent. The product can then be dried to remove substantially any organic solvent and water remaining in the reaction mixture.

Furthermore, Chakrabarti A. 'Cationic ion exchange resins as catalyst' Reactive Polymers 1993, Vol. 20, No. 1-2, 1-45 provides a review about using cationic ion exchange resins as catalyst. Among further prior art, use of ion exchange resins is disclosed in "DOWEX Ion Exchange Resins - Fundamentals of Ion Exchange" Product guide [online]. Dow Corporation, June 2000 [retrieved on 2010-10-21]. Retrieved from the Internet: <URL: http://www.dow.com/PublishedLiterature/dh_0032/0901b803800326ca.pdf? Filepath=liquidseps/pdfs/noreg/177-01837.pdf&fromPage=GetDoc>. When a strong liquid acid, base, organic acid or organic base is used as the hydrolysis and condensation catalyst, carryover of the liquid catalyst in the precipitated AMS or co-AMS product can require special treatment for its removal. Therefore, an alternative method for making AMS or co-AMS products is here presented. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been unexpectedly discovered that solid strong cationic exchange resin hydrolysis and condensation catalysts such as those used for cationic ion exchange chromatography in, for example, the petroleum industry, can be employed as the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst in the production of the AMS and/or co-AMS compounds when a strong acid is desired as the catalyst. The use of such solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalysts in this reaction system is advantageous because they remain as solids throughout the reaction, allowing simplified separation of the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst from the soluble AMS or co-AMS products, resulting in total or near total recovery of the AMS or co-AMS products without acid carryover, as well as virtual total recovery of the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst for recycling. In particular, a method is presented for making alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes or co-alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanesin accordance with claim 1. The resulting products consist essentially of a mixture of alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes having an open structure with a reactive alkoxysilyl group, and are essentially free of closed caged polyhedral organosilsesquioxanes. Further, the resulting products are free of residual acid catalyst. The method can further comprise the step of recovering the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst from the reaction mixture for recycling said catalyst. It is a characterizing feature of the method according to the inventionthat the alkoxy-modified silsesquioxane is free of residual acidcatalyst. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A method is presented for making an alkoxy-modified silsesquioxane comprising one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes having the formula and mixtures, thereof, wherein w, x and y represent mole fractions, y does not equal zero, either w or x but not both can be zero, and w +x + y = 1.00, the method comprising the steps of: (a) combining as a reaction mixture: (i) water, (ii) a polar protic or polar aprotic solvent for the water, (iii) a solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst, and (iv) an R- trialkoxysilane, wherein R comprises a group bonded to the silicon atom and is independently selected from the group consisting of R1, R2 and R3, wherein R1, R2 and R3 are the same or different and selected from the group consisting of (i) H or an alkyl group having one to 20 carbon atoms, (ii) cycloalkyl groups having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, (iii) alkylaryl groups having 7 to 20 carbon atoms, and (iv) R5X, wherein X is selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br, SH, SaR6, NR62, OR6, CO2H, SCOR6, CO2R6, OH, olefins, amino groups and vinyl groups, wherein a = 2 to 8, R5 is selected from the group consisting of alkylene groups having one to 20 carbon atoms, cycloalkylene groups having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, and R4 and R6 are selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups having one to 20 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl groups having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, and alkylaryl groups having 7 to 20 carbon atoms;(b) allowing the reaction mixture to react for 0.5 hours to 200 hours to form the alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes; and(c) recovering the alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes from the reaction mixture; wherein the mixture of alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes liberates 0.05% to 10% by weight alcohol when treated by total acid hydrolysis, and wherein the alkoxy-modified silsesquioxane is free of residual acid catalyst; and wherein step (a) comprises the substep of washing the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst with water and a solvent for the water to remove free acid prior to addition of the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst to the reaction mixture. When produced according to the method, the recovered alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes consist essentially of a mixture of alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes having an open structure with a reactive alkoxysilyl group, and are free of closed caged polyhedral organosilsesquioxanes. Further, the recovered silsesquioxanes are free of residual acid catalyst. In general, the AMS or co-AMS compound(s) can be made by subjecting one or more trialkoxysilanes to hydrolysis and condensation in an aqueous alcohol solution in the presence of a solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst. The reaction is continued for a period of time sufficient for substantial total conversion of the trialkoxysilane(s) to the AMS or co-AMS compounds. As described below, it has been found that the rate of conversion of the reactants to the final product can be controlled by the concentration of the reactants (trialkoxysilane(s), acid and water), as well as the ratio of the trialkoxysilane(s) to the water. In particular, the greater the concentration of the reactants, the shorter the reaction time. According to the invention, the acid-stable solvent for the water can be any polar protic or polar aprotic solvent including any alcohol such as ethanol, methanol, butanol, n-propanol or isopropanol, and mixtures of these. More suitably, the alcohol is selected from ethanol, methanol, and mixtures of these. The use of alcohol allows for further additions of water and trialkoxysilanes to provide a continuous reaction. The step of recovering the AMS or co-AMS from the reaction mixture can comprise separating the mixture of alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes from the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst by adding to the reaction mixture water and a nonpolar solvent for the silsesquioxanes and allowing phase separation of the water/alcohol and the nonpolar solvent. For example, it is suitable to add water to the reaction mixture with the nonpolar solvent, prior to phase separation, to dilute the solvent and allow any alcohol that may be soluble in the solvent to enter the water phase. Any remaining silsesquioxanes in the reaction mixture can be re-extracted with water and the nonpolar solvent. The recovery of the mixture of alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes from the nonpolar solvent phase can be accomplished by any known method such as decantation of the nonpolar phase containing the AMS or co-AMS product, followed by e.g. drying in a warm vacuum oven, to remove the solvent and any water that may be present. The resulting AMS or co-AMS product is a liquid or a solid, suitably a highly viscous liquid and, more suitably, a slightly viscous liquid, substantially free of moisture, free alcohol and residual acid catalyst. The solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst can easily be recovered from the reaction mixture as a precipitate in the water/alcohol phase, such as by filtration, providing for its reuse in subsequent reactions. Any nonpolar solvent for AMS or co-AMS product can be used to elute the product from the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst. Suitable nonpolar solvents include hexane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, and mixtures of these. Further according to the invention, a polar aprotic solvent for the water can be used in place of the polar protic solvent. Suitable polar aprotic solvents include tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,4-dioxane, 1,3-dioxolane, acetone, acetonitrile, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, and mixtures of these. Such solvents are also solvents for the AMS and co-AMS products of the reaction. Therefore, it is not necessary to add a nonpolar solvent for the products to separate the products from the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst. Although it is recognized that acetone, ethyl acetate, and THF can very slowly react with the acid catalyst under certain conditions, no significant reaction of this type takes place under the conditions of time, temperature, and concentration of the acid employed in the strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst of the invention methods. The use of the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst is particularly efficient. Because of the solubility of the AMS or co-AMS products in the polar aprotic solvent, residual alkoxysiloxane groups can be minimized by extending the reaction time to allow further hydrolysis and condensation. The method proceeds as above in steps (a) through (c). Recovery of the mixture of AMS or co-AMS products can be accomplished by any known method such as decantation of the polar aprotic phase containing the AMS or co-AMS product, followed by drying e.g. in a warm vacuum oven, to remove the solvent and any water that may be present. Again, the resulting product is a liquid or a solid, suitably a highly viscous liquid and, more suitably, a slightly viscous liquid, substantially free of moisture, of free alcohol and of residual acid catalyst. The solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst can easily be recovered from the reaction mixture as a precipitate, such as by filtration, providing for its reuse in subsequent reactions. Suitable solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalysts for use in making the AMS or co-AMS products are commercially available and include cationic ion exchange resins that have sulfonic acid groups attached to an insoluble polymeric matrix. These solid resins contain a H+ counter ion that is a strong cation exchanger due to its very low pKa (<1.0). As an example, such cationic ion exchange resins can be prepared by sulfonating (by treating with sulfuric acid) a polystyrene that has been crosslinked with 1 percent to 8 percent divinylbenzene. Examples of suitable commercially available strong cationic exchange resins include the H+ ionic form of Amberlite IR-120, Amberlyst A-15, Purolite C-100, and any of the Dowex® 50WX series resins. Such resins are typically gel beads having particle sizes of 400 mesh to 50 mesh (37 to 297 µm). The particle size is not crucial in the methods of the invention. Other types of solid supports for the strong cationic ions have been described, such as polymer strips, or polymer membranes. Such alternative forms are within the scope of the invention, as claimed. Suitably, the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalysts are in a physical form that, after the AMS or co-AMS products are extracted, will precipitate (or sink) to the bottom of the reaction chamber for simple separation from the reaction mixture, such as by filtration. It has been observed that new resins frequently contain free sulfuric acid that is present from the sulfonation procedure. This free acid can cause a high viscosity of the AMS or co-AMS product formed in the hydrolysis and condensation reaction. Therefore, according to the invention, this free acid is removed by washing with water and a solvent for the water. By using a solvent for the water in addition to the wash water, it has been found that there is less residual water retained by the resin. As described further below, it has been observed that a catalytic amount of the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst used in the reaction can be as little as 1% to 50%, suitably 5% to 40%, of the molar amount of the acid and the trialkoxysilane used in the preparation. The temperature at which the reaction takes place is not critical except that it be less than the boiling point of the solvent. For example, almost identical compositions of AMS or co-AMS product can be obtained from ambient temperature (about 25°C) to 60°C to 100°C. The expected rate enhancement of the reaction can be attained as the temperature increases. The AMS or co-AMS product can be observed as a cloudy residue that, if desired, can be progressively removed from the reaction mixture over a period of time until there is substantially total conversion of the reactants to the AMS or co-AMS product. Moreover, during the reaction, additional amounts of the trialkoxysilane reactants can be added, with water, to continuously yield product. If a polar protic solvent for the water, such as alcohol, is used, the formation of the AMS or co-AMS can be initially observed as a cloudy solution which phase separates with increasing time. If a polar aprotic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) is used, the AMS or co-AMS in the solvent is essentially clear. The phase containing the products, if desired, can be steadily removed from the reaction mixture over a period of time until there is substantially total conversion to the AMS or co-AMS products. Moreover, during the reaction, additional amounts of the trialkoxysilane reactants can be added, with water, to continuously yield product. The period of time for total conversion of the reactants to the AMS or co-AMS product depends on the original concentration of the reactants, the solubility of the AMS or co-AMS in the solvent and the optional addition of reactants and/or applied heat during the process. However, if no additional reactants are used, the time can range from 0.5 hours to 200 hours, often 0.75 hours to 120 hours, or one hour to 72 hours. The time for total conversion is defined as the time elapsed until no further product can be removed by phase separation and no further product can be extracted from the reaction mixture by water and organic solvent, as described above. Exemplary alkyltrialkoxysilane reactants in making the AMS products can includeoctyltriethoxysilane, octyltrimethoxysilane, cyclohexyltriethoxysilane, isobutyltriethoxysilane, ethyltrimethoxysilane, cyclohexyltributoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, propyltriethoxysilane, hexyltriethoxysilane, heptyltriethoxysilane, nonyltriethoxy-silane, decyltriethoxysilane, 3-chloropropyltriethoxysilane, 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane, n-dodecyltrialkoxysilane, octadecyltriethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxysilane, propyltrimethoxysilane, hexyltrimethoxysilane, heptyltrimethoxysilane, nonyltrimethoxysilane, octadecyltrimethoxysilane, 2-ethylhexyltriethoxysilane, and mixtures thereof. Co-AMS compounds can be obtained by co-reacting any number of trialkoxysilanes such as alkyltriethoxysilane and/or alkyltrimethoxysilanes, by hydrolysis and condensation with one or more other trialkoxysilanes that can provide one or more functional groups (R5X, as defined above) on the AMS compound. As an example, for use in rubber compounds, it may be desirable to produce a co-AMS compound containing a sulfur atom that can bind to an elastomer. Therefore, a suitable co-AMS compound can be manufactured by the cohydrolysis and co-condensation of an alkyltrialkoxysilane with, for example, a mercaptoalkyltrialkoxysilane to introduce a mercaptoalkyl functionality, or with a blocked mercaptoalkyltrialkoxysilane to introduce a blocked mercaptoalkyl functionality. Examples of suitable sulfur-containing trialkoxysilanes include mercapto-alkyltrialkoxysilanes, blocked mercaptoalkyltrialkoxysilanes, 3-thioacylpropyltrialkoxy-silane, 3-thiooctanoylpropyl-trialkoxysilane, a trialkoxysilane containing a chain of 2 to 8 sulfur atoms, and mixtures of these. In this description the use of the term "blocked mercaptoalkyltrialkoxysilane" is defined as a mercaptosilane silica coupling agent that comprises a blocking moiety that blocks the mercapto part of the molecule (i.e. the mercapto hydrogen atom is replaced by another group, hereafter referred to as "blocking group") while not affecting the silica-reactive mercaptosilane moiety. Suitable blocked mercaptosilanes can include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,127,468; 6,204,339; 6,528,673; 6,635,700; 6,649,684 and 6,683,135. For purposes of this disclosure, the silica-reactive "mercaptosilane moiety" is defined as the molecular weight equivalent to the molecular weight of 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane. A deblocking agent can be added during or after rubber compounding (e.g., later in the manufacturing process, such as during cure), after the silica-silane reaction has occurred, to allow the sulfur atom of the mercaptosilane to bond rapidly with the rubber. The deblocking agent can be added at any time during the compounding process as a single component during any mixing stage in which deblocking is desired. Examples of deblocking agents are well known to those skilled in the art. The AMS or co-AMS products resulting from the catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation reaction can be observed as a multitude of peaks when measured, for example, by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The oligomers comprise a mixture of linear, branched and/or isomeric placements of the alkoxy modification. The collection of products is referred to as alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes and/or co-alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes. For example, these alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes can include octyl alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes, phenyl alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes, 3-mercaptopropyl alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes, 3-thioacylpropyl alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes, and mixtures of any of these. Thus, the alkoxy-modified silsesquioxane(s) can comprise alkylalkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes or alkyl-co-mercapto alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes. As examples of trialkoxysilanes that can be used in the methods of the present invention, the formula weights of the original silane and the perfect silsesquioxane that would be expected to form from the total hydrolysis reaction are illustrated in Table 1. Table 1R-SilaneSi-X3R-SiX3 (g/mol)R-SiO3/2 (g/mol)octyltriethoxy276.5165.313-mercaptopropyltrimethoxy196.3127.233-thiooctanoylpropyltriethoxya364.6253.44phenyltriethoxy198.3129.17aNXT™ (a blocked mercaptan from Crompton, Greenwich CT) These values can be used along with the mole fractions of the silanes charged to determine the approximate theoretical yield for a desired AMS or co-AMS, when using the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst in the hydrolysis and condensation reaction. Table 2 illustrates an example of kinetic runs including molar ratios of the various ingredients that can be used to produce the AMS or co-AMS products. Table 2Run #SolventOTES mol/LHCl mol protons/LWater mol/LAEtOH0.790.7713.62BEtOH0.400.4013.99CEtOH0.400.406.41DMeOH0.400.406.39EEtOH0.400.803.72FEtOH0.800.407.00 For example, runs A-D use essentially equivalent molar ratios of OTES and acid; whereas run E uses a 2X molar amount of acid and run F uses a 0.5X molar amount of acid. Compared with runs A and B, runs C and D use about one-half the molar amount of water; run E uses about one-quarter the molar amount of water with a 2X molar amount of acid; and run F uses about one-half the molar amount of water, but the molar amount of OTES is doubled. It was observed that there was a steady increase in the amount of AMS formed in moles/L as the concentrations of the OTES, HCl and water increased (run A, data not shown). Further, the rate of reaction for the intermediate and high level of water (runs B, C and D) was about the same at a mole ratio of 0.40 mol/L OTES. Exchanging the ethanol with methanol showed about a two fold increase in the initial rate of product formation. The reduction of water to 3.7 mol/L (run E), even with a doubling of the HCl reduced the rate by about one-half, compared with run D (data not shown). Extrapolating from these preliminary runs employing HCl as the strong acid, it can be seen that a molar catalytic amount of the protons present in the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst used in the reactions according to the methods of the present invention suitably can be as little as 1 % to 50% and, more suitably, 5% to 40% of the molar amount of the trialkoxysilane used in the preparation. Within the limits of practicality, there is virtually no lower or upper limitations on the molar concentrations of the reactants. A feature of each of the AMS or co-AMS products produced is the presence of a reactive alkoxysilyl group "y" attached to one or more alkoxy-modified silsesquioxane "w" and/or "x" groups. In an AMS compound, either w or x but not both can be zero. In a co-AMS, w and x are not zero. The mole fraction of the one or more w or x groups is calculated as the mole fraction of w or x divided by the sum of the mole fractions w+x. Suitably, ratios of the w mole fraction (or the ratio of the x mole fraction) to the sum of the w+x fraction can range from 0.01 to 0.5. The mole fractions of x, y and z also can be measured through the mole fractions of R1, R2, and R3 if the relative abundance of those groups can be measured. The sum of the mole fractions w, x and y is always equal to one, and y is not zero. The individual weight fractions of w, x and y can be calculated from the mole fraction of each times their respective formula weight (FW) divided by the sum of the individual w, x and y weight fractions. For example, the weight percent of x (W%(x)) is calculated as W%x=xFWxxFWx+wFWw+yFWy×100 The weight percent of alcohol (HOR4) can be calculated by the formula W%HOR4=3FWHOR4xFWx+wFWw+yFWy×100 The alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes made using these methods consist essentially of "open" structures having the reactive alkoxysilyl group and are essentially free of pure closed caged polyhedral organosilsesquioxanes (POSS) structures that are known for use as nanoparticle fillers in various compounds. For example, a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the 29Si content of an exemplary oligomer mixture, as illustrated in the aforementioned patent application, shows a broad range (in parts per million, ppm) from -47 ppm to -71 ppm. In comparison, NMR analysis of the 29Si content of a pure closed caged POSS structure shows a definitive peak at -68 ppm. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the method of preparation of the AMS and co-AMS products, as described above and as described in the aforementioned patent application, precludes or minimizes the formation of pure POSS structures because of the myriad of different geometric attachments that the rapid condensation of a trialkoxysilane generates. NMR spectra ranges for the amount of 1H and/or 13C in the products can also be determined, but these spectra will differ, depending on the various R groups attached to the structures, and are not illustrated here. Another important feature of each of the AMS or co-AMS products produced is that the reactive alkoxysilyl group is present at such a low level that only a small amount of alcohol can be liberated by hydrolysis of the product. That is, the y alkoxysilyl group generates only 0.05% to 10% by weight alcohol when the product is treated by substantially total acid hydrolysis. Suitably, the amount of generated alcohol is 0.5% to 8% by weight and, more suitably, the amount of generated alcohol is 1% to 6% by weight. The amount of residual reactive alkoxysilyl groups in each of the final AMS or co-AMS products can be measured by the amount of alcohol recoverable from the product, according to the method published in Rubber Chemistry & Technology 75, 215 (2002). Briefly, a sample of the product is treated by total acid hydrolysis using a siloxane hydrolysis reagent (0.2 N toluenesulfonic acid/0.24 N water/15% n-butanol/85% toluene). This reagent quantitatively reacts with residual ethoxysilane (EtOSi) or methoxysilane (MeOSi), freeing a substantially total amount of ethanol or methanol that is then measured by a headspace/gas chromatographic technique, and expressed as the percentage by weight in the sample. Therefore, the AMS or co-AMS product(s) produced are very suitable for use in rubber compositions in which silica is employed as a reinforcing filler. In particular, the reactive alkoxysilane group(s) attached to the AMS or co-AMS products can participate in the alkoxysilane-silica reaction and can improve silica dispersion in the rubber. Therefore, the AMS or co-AMS product(s) made by a method of according to the invention can be used to form a vulcanizable rubber compound comprising (a) an elastomer; (b) a reinforcing filler comprising silica or a mixture thereof with carbon black; (c) a silica dispersing aid comprising an improved alkoxy-modified silsesquioxane rubber obtained by the method according to the invention, wherein the alkoxy-modified silsesquioxane is substantially free of residual acid catalyst; and (d) a cure agent. According to the disclosure of the aforementioned patent application, other additives can be included in the vulcanizable rubber compound. As discussed above, the alkoxysilane-silica reaction produces alcohol as a by-product when alkyltrialkoxysilanes and/or alkoxysilane-terminated polymer groups are used for silica dispersion in rubber compounds. Usually, the trialkoxysilane employed is a triethoxysilane or a trimethoxysilane, and the generated alcohol is ethanol or methanol, respectively. Because these alcohol emissions add to the VOC emissions generated from processing of the other rubber tire components, the amount of reinforcing silica and concomitant amount of trialkoxysilane employed is governed and limited by government environmental regulations. The limited amount of alcohol that is available in the AMS or co-AMS product(s) make these compounds very useful in rubber compounds because they have the potential to significantly reduce the level of potential VOCs emitted as alcohol during compounding and further processing. Moreover, the limited amount of available unreacted alkoxysilane groups during and after mixing, severely limit the degree of blistering in the vulcanized rubber compounds and tires made from them. The use of the products made according to the method of the invention also allow a significant increase in the amount of silica used for reinforcement. The use of the AMS and/or co-AMS products, including the improved products made by a method according to the invention, in rubber compounds not only minimizes alcohol emissions during compounding and further processing of the rubber, but these products also perform well as silica dispersing agents, giving improved physical properties to the stocks containing the compounds. The vulcanized rubber compounds containing the improved AMS and/or co-AMS compounds made by a method according to the present invention can be utilized to form products such as power belts, and treadstocks for pneumatic tires. The composition can also be used to form other elastomeric tire components such as subtreads, sidewalls, body ply skims, bead fillers, apex, chafer, sidewall insert, wirecoat and inner liner. EXAMPLES The following examples illustrate methods of preparation of representative alkoxy-modified silsesquioxanes employing a solid strong cationic exchange resin as the solid strong cationic exchange hydrolysis and condensation catalyst. Example 1 (Reference Example) Preparation of n-Octyl Alkoxy-Modified Silsesquioxane (Octyl-AMS) using Dowex 50WX2-200 resin To a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask was added 9.23 grams (44.3 mmol of H+) of dry Dowex 50WX2-200 (a strong cationic exchange polystyrene resin crosslinked with 2% divinylbenzene and having sulfonic acid as the functional group, 200 mesh particles), 238 mL of absolute ethanol and 27.95 grams (1.613 mol) of distilled water. When the resin was uniformly dispersed, 41.36 grams (150 mmol) of octyltriethoxysilane (OTES) was added. The molar ratio of the silane to the H+ of the resin was about 30:1. After stirring for 17 hours, the AMS produced coated the resin as a lower phase. The addition of 260 mL of cyclohexane and 260 mL of water gave the AMS in the upper phase and the resin as a precipitate in the lower aqueous phase. Recovery of the resin by filtration and drying gave 6.91 grams (75% of the original amount). The AMS was recovered as a high viscosity material by evaporation of the solvent to give 24.56 grams (98% of the theoretical yield, TY). Example 2 (Reference Example) Preparation of Octyl-AMS using recovered Dowex 50WX2-200 resin The procedure according to Example 1 was repeated, except that 6.91 grams (33.2 mmol of H+) of recovered Dowex-50WX2-200 (from Example 1) was used in 160 mL of absolute ethanol, 21.14 grams (1.22 mol) of water and 28.24 grams (102 mmol) of OTES. The resin in the initial reaction mixture compressed within 3 hours to less than 50% of the original dispersed volume as the AMS formation coated the particles. After stirring for 24 hours, cyclohexane and water was added to isolate 17.46 grams (103.4% TY) of a less viscous AMS. Example 3 Preparation of Octyl-AMS using Dowex 50WX2-200 resin that was previously washed to remove excess free sulfonic acid The Dowex resin was twice washed with THF and water to remove the free sulfuric acid that is present in new resin. This free acid was thought to be the cause of the high viscosity AMS that was produced in the preparations according to Examples 1 and 2. Thus, 15.39 grams of the Dowex resin (containing 73.9 mmol of sulfonic acid, as measured by thermoanalysis) was dispersed in 150 mL of THF containing 15 mL of water. The mixture was stirred, decanted and washed a second time with the THF and water. The mixture was then rinsed once more with THF. The amount of sulfonic acid and water remaining in the catalyst slurry was measured and subsequent charges of water and THF in the reaction mixture to produce AMS were adjusted accordingly. The reaction mixture was run according to Example 1, with the washed Dowex resin, 182 mL of THF, 24.65 grams (1.77 mol) of water and 41.2 grams (149 mmol) of OTES. The mixture was stirred for 24 hours and filtered to recover the resin (12.07 grams). Evaporation of the THF yielded 24.67 grams of a desired slightly viscous AMS. Example 4 Determination of latent ethanol in the AMS produced in Example 3 Prior to separating the AMS from the THF solution in Example 3, a sample of the solution was analyzed for ethanol by head space gas chromatography. The average of 8.30% ethanol measured within one hour of reaction time compared favorably to the 9.03% theoretical amount of ethanol that a complete reaction would produce (92% of the TY of ethanol was obtained). Analysis of the AMS product obtained after 24 hours of reaction time showed 0.238% latent ethanol.
