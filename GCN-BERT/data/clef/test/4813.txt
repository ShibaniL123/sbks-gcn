Step 1. 1-(((3-Bromo-4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl)methyl)cyclobutan-1-ol
To a solution of 2-bromo-1-methyl-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzene (50 mg, 0.20 mmol) in THF (1.0 mL) at −78° C. was added dropwise n-butyllithium (80 μL, 0.20 mmol, 2.5 M in hexanes), and the reaction mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then added dropwise to a solution of cyclobutanone (16 μL, 0.22 mmol) in THF (2.0 mL) at −78° C. After 10 min, the −78° C. bath was removed, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 4 h, during which it came to rt. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 0° C., and the reaction was quenched with sat. NH4Cl. The mixture was partitioned between water and DCM. The organic layer was removed, and the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (2×). The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via preparative HPLC on a C-18 column (pH 2, 26-51% MeCN/0.1% TFA (aq) over 5 min, 60 mL/min) afforded the title compound as a white solid (11 mg, 14%).
