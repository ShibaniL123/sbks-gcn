Reference Example 3
In this reference example, a method for synthesizing tris{2-[1-(4-cyano-2,6-diisobutylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl-κN3]phenyl-κC}iridium(III) (abbreviation: [Ir(pim-diBuCNp)3]), which is the organometallic complex used in Example 3, is described. The structural formula of [Ir(pim-diBuCNp)3] is shown below.
Step 1: Synthesis of 1-(4-cyano-2,6-diisobutylphenyl)-2-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole
Into a 1000 mL three-neck flask were put 22 g (117 mmol) of N-(2-chloroethyl)benzamide and 260 mL of dehydrated xylene. To this mixed solution was added 33 g (158 mmol) of phosphorus pentachloride, and the mixture was heated and stirred at 140° C. for one hour to be reacted. After the reaction, the mixture was cooled down to room temperature, a mixed solution of 28 g (120 mmol) of 4-amino-3,5-diisobutylbenzonitrile and 60 mL of dehydrated xylene was dropped thereinto, and heating and stirring were performed at 140° C. for 5 hours. This reaction mixture was slowly added to 500 mL of water and stirring was performed at room temperature for 30 minutes. To this mixture was added chloroform. The obtained solution of the extract was slowly added to a 1M sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. An aqueous layer and an organic layer of this mixture were separated. The obtained solution of the extract was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate, and then washed with saturated saline. After washing, anhydrous magnesium sulfate was added to the organic layer for drying, and the resulting mixture was subjected to gravity filtration to give a filtrate. The obtained filtrate was concentrated to give a solid. A mixed solvent of ethyl acetate and hexane was added to the solid, the mixture was subjected to suction filtration, whereby 33 g of a white solid was obtained in a yield of 79 %. The obtained white solid was identified as 1-(4-cyano-2,6-diisobutylphenyl)-2-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). A synthesis scheme of Step 1 is shown in (a-2).
