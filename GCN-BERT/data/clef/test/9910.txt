Step 5: preparation of intermediate 6-allyloxy-3-oxazol-2-yl-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (7e)
To a solution of of compound tert-butyl 3-(allyloxyamino)-5-oxazol-2-yl-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylate (7d) (257 mg, 0.80 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (4 mL) at 0°C under argon were added TEA (223 µL, 1.60 mmol) and diphosgene (125.5 µL, 1.04 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1 h, diluted with DCM and washed with brine. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in anhydrous dioxane (1 mL) and dropwise added to a 4 M HCl solution in dioxane (8 mL). The mixture was stirred at rt for 1 h and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in anhydrous DCM (8 mL) cooled at 0°C and TEA (446 µL, 3.20 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred at rt for 1h then washed with brine. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (DCM/Acetone: 100/0 to 80/20) to provide 6-allyloxy-3-oxazol-2-yl-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (7e) (155 mg, 0.63 mmol, 78%).
