[0036] It is to be understood that the invention is not necessarily limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components and/or methods set forth in the following description and/or illustrated in the drawings. The scope of the invention extends to other embodiments or may be practiced or carried out in various other ways. [0037] Reference is now made to Fig. 1, which is a simplified schematic view of an implant nipple with integrated areola 2 implanted in a female's breast 1. The implanted nipple with integrated areola 2 is placed underneath the natural nipple and areola 4 thus stretching it to a forward prominent position. According to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention the implant nipple with integrated areola 2 may consists of openings 3. Openings 3 may allow breast tissues to gradually grow into the implant 2 and thus to affix the implant strongly in its position. [0038] Reference is now made to Fig. 1A, which illustrates an exemplary method of inserting an implant nipple with integrated areola 12 into a female's breast 10. First an incision 14 may be made in the skin 11. The incision 14 may partially be made along the circumference of nipple and areola 16 thus allowing the nipple and areola 16 remain partially connected to breast 10. Natural nipple and areola 16 may then be partially separated from the breast tissue 10 thus creating a receiving pocket 15. Implant nipple and/or nipple with integrated areola 12 may then be inserted in the direction indicated by arrow 13 into its place in pocket 15 underneath natural nipple and areola 16. Bonding, such as stitches or biomedical glue, may be applied to close incision 14. The implanted nipple and/or nipple with integrated areola 12 are now placed in its intended position as showed in Fig. 1. [0039] Reference is now made to Fig. IB, which illustrates another exemplary method of implementation of a nipple and/or nipple with integrated areola implant 22 in a female breast 20. First natural nipple and areola 23 skin 21 is cut along its circumference and the natural nipple and areola 23 are removed in its entirety from breast 20. Then implant nipple and/or nipple with integrated areola 22 are positioned in place of the natural nipple and areola 23 now removed. Natural nipple and areola are placed back 24 in its original position on breast 20 and is stitched to skin 21. The implanted nipple and/or nipple with integrated areola 23 are now positioned in its place as showed in Fig. 1. The diameter of the implanted nipple and/or nipple with integrated areola 23 may be in the range of 5-100 mm. The diameter of the cut in skin 21may be made to accommodate the specific implantable nipple and/or nipple with integrated areola 23 and may be, according to some embodiments, larger than that of the natural nipple and areola 23 by 0.5 - 10 mm. Additionally, the thickness of the implantable nipple and/or nipple with integrated areola may be in the range of 0.2 - 10 mm. Accordingly, the thickness of the removed skin may include tissue section attached to it, that may be formed to accommodate the thickness of the implantable nipple 23. [0040] Reference is now made to Fig. 1C, which represents face view of a female anatomical breast structure 37 in which: milk ducts 33, lobules 32, areola 36, fat 35, and nervous 34. Implant nipple and/or nipple with integrated areola 30 in this exemplary embodiment is showed placed in between areola 36 and nervous 35 layers and lobules 32 and milk duct 33 layers. Thus the implanted nipple and/or nipple with integrated areola 30 lies where the areola 36 in front of it and the nervous 35, milk duct 33 and the lobules 32 are at its back. In some cases the milk ducts 33, lobules 32, areola 36, fat 35, and nervous 34 may be disconnected from the natural nipple and areola in order to allow the insertion of the implanted nipple and/or nipple with integrated areola 30. In some other cases the breast tissue organs may left connected to the natural nipple and the implanted nipple and/or nipple with integrated areola 30 is inserted so that the relevant nipple organs are inserted via gap 31 of the implant. [0041] Reference is now made to Figs. 2 and 2A, which represent a tip implantable nipple that may configure to be a hemisphere shape or a tube. [0042] Fig. 2 shows an embodiment of a tip 40 made for example from flexible and resilient plastic material such as Silicone. The tip may consist of inner space 41. The tip inner space 41 may be hollow. After implant tip 40 is placed under the natural nipple the hollow space 41 may be filled with breast tissue which may naturally grow in it thus to enable strong hold of the tip 40 in its intended implanted position. [0043] FIG 2A shows an embodiment of an implant tip 42 that may consist of a slot 43 running from the tip 43 to the perimeter circumference of the open end of tip 42. When implant tip 42 is implanted in its place under the natural nipple, slot 43 enables the tip 42 bypass over the breast organs connected to the natural nipple. It may be noted that slot 43 may prevent the necessity to cut the breast organs during placement. The implant tip 42 may further consist of hollow inner space 44. The tip configuration may be tapered or straight tube or any other shape, as may be required to best fit the natural nipple.
