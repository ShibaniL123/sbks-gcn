The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, debilitating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) . MS has also been classified as an autoimmune disease. MS disease activity can be monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, accumulation of disability, as well as rate and severity of relapses. There are five main forms of multiple sclerosis: 1) Benign Multiple Sclerosis: Benign multiple sclerosis is a retrospective diagnosis which is characterized by 1-2 exacerbations with complete recovery, no lasting disability and no disease progression for 10-15 years after the initial onset. Benign multiple sclerosis may, however, progress into other forms of multiple sclerosis. 2) Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS): Patients suffering from RRMS experience sporadic exacerbations or relapses, as well as periods of remission. Lesions and evidence of axonal loss may or may not be visible on MRI for patients with RRMS. 3) Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS): SPMS may evolve from RRMS. Patients afflicted with SPMS have relapses, a diminishing degree of recovery during remissions, less frequent remissions and more pronounced neurological deficits than RRMS patients. Enlarged ventricles, which are markers for atrophy of the corpus callosum, midline center and spinal cord, are visible on MRI of patients with SPMS. 4) Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS); PPMS is characterized by a steady progression of increasing neurological deficits without distinct attacks or remissions. Cerebral lesions, diffuse spinal cord damage and evidence of axonal loss are evident on the MRI of patients with PPMS. 5) Progressive-Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS): PRMS has periods of acute exacerbations while proceeding along a course of increasing neurological deficits without remissions. Lesions are evident on MRI of patients suffering from PRMS (Multiple sclerosis: its diagnosis, symptoms, types and stages, 2003, albany.net/.about .tjc/multiple-sclerosis.html; What are the Types of Multiple Sclerosis? 2005, <imaginis.com/multiplesclerosis/types-of-ms.asp? mode=l>). Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis is a term used to collectively refer to SPMS, PPMS, and PRMS (Types of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), 2005, <themcfox.com/multiplesclerosis/ types-of-ms/types-of-multi-pie-sclerosis.htm>). The relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis are SPMS with superimposed relapses, RRMS and PRMS. Glatiramer acetate (GA), a mixture of polypeptides which do not all have the same amino acid sequence, is marketed under the tradename Copaxone®. GA comprises the acetate salts of polypeptides containing L-glutamic acid, L-alanine, L-tyrosine and L-lysine at average molar fractions of 0.141, 0.427, 0.095 and 0.338, respectively. The average molecular weight of Copaxone® is between 5,000 and 9,000 daltons. ("Copaxone", Physician's Desk Reference, (2005), Medical Economics Co., Inc., (Montvale, N.J.), 3115.) Chemically, glatiramer acetate is designated L-glutamic acid polymer with L-alanine, L-lysine, L-tyrosine, acetate (salt). Its structural formula is: (Glu,Ala,Lys,Tyr)χ.Χ CH3COOH (C5H9NO4' C3H7NO2' C6Hi4N202 ' C9H11NO3) χ'χ CHO CAS-147245-92-9 Copaxone® ("Copaxone", Full Prescribing Information, (February, 2009), FDA Marketing Label) (20mg glatiramer acetate daily injection) is an approved therapy for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), including patients who have experienced a first clinical episode and have MRI features consistent with multiple sclerosis. GA has also been disclosed for use in the treatment of other autoimmune diseases (U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0055466 Α1 (R. Aharoni et al.), inflammatory ηοηautoimmune diseases (U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0014694 Al (V. Wee Yong et al. ) ; and U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0077278 Al, published Jun. 20, 2002 (Young et al. ) ) and other diseases (U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2003/0004099 Al and 2002/0037848 Al (Eisenbach-Schwart ζ, et al. ) ; U.S. Pat. No. 6, 514,938 Bl, issued Feb. 4, 2003 (Gad et al.); PCT International Publication No. WO 01/60392, published Aug. 23, 2001 (Gilbert et al. ) ; PCT International Publication No. WO 00/27417, published May 19, 2000 (Aharoni et al.); and PCT International Publication No. WO 01/97846, published Dec. 27, 2001 (Moses et al. ) . The 20mg/day subcutaneous (s.c.) dose has been shown to reduce the total number of enhancing lesions in MS patients as measured by MRI (G. Comi et al. , European/Canadian Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study of the Effects of Glatiramer Acetere on Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Measured Disease Activity and Burden in Patients with Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis, Ann. Neurol. 49:290-297 (2001) ). Safety data accumulated for GA in clinical trials shows that the drug product is safe and well tolerated. Disclosed is an effective low frequency dosage regimen of GA administration to patients suffering from a relapsing form of multiple sclerosis, including patients who have experienced a first clinical episode and have MRI features consistent with multiple sclerosis.

DEFINITIONS As used herein, immediate post injection reaction (IRPR) refers to a reaction such as, palpitations, feeling hot, flushing, hot flushes, tachycardia, dyspnoea, chest discomfort, chest pain, and non-cardiac chest pain that occurs immediately following injection. Reactions may also include asthenia, back pain, bacterial infection, chills, cyst, face edema, fever, flu syndrome, infection, injection site erythema, injection site hemorrhage, injection site induration, injection site inflammation, injection site mass, injection site pain, injection site pruritus, injection site urticaria, injection site welt, neck pain, pain, migrane, syncope, tachycardia, vasodilatation, anorexia, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal disorder, nausea, vomiting, ecchymosis, peripheral edema, arthralgia, agitation, anxiety, confusion, foot drop, hypertonia, nervousness, nystagmus, speech disorder, tremor, vertigo, bronchitis, dyspnea, laryngismus, rhinitis, erythema, herpes simplex, pruritus, rash, skin nodule, sweating, urticaria, ear pain, eye disorder, dysmenorrheal, urinary urgency, and vaginal moniliasis. As used herein, injection site reaction (ISR) refers to a reaction such as erythema, hemorrhage, induration, inflammation, mass, pain, pruritus, urticaria, and welt that occurs immediately around the site of injection. As used herein, "tolerability" relates to the level of discomfort associated with GA treatment. Tolerability is associated with the frequency and severity of post injection reactions and injection site reactions. Tolerability influences the period that a patient can follow GA treatment. As used herein, the term Gd-enhancing lesions, refers to lesions that result from a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, which appear in contrast studies using gandolinium contrast agents. Gandolinium enhancement provides information as to the age of a lesion, as Gd-enhancing lesions typically occur within a six week period of lesion formation. As used herein, the term Ti-weighted MRI images refers to an MR-image that emphasizes Τΐ contrast by which lesions may be visualized. Abnormal areas in a Ti-weigted MRI image are "hypointense" and appear as dark spots. These spots are generally older lesions. As used herein, the term T2-weighted MRI image, refers to an MR-image that emphasizes T2 contrast by which lesions may be visualized. T2 lesions represent new inflammatory activity. As used herein, the term "unit dosage" refers to physically discrete units suited as single administration dose for a subject to be treated, containing a therapeutically effective quantity of active compound in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier, e.g., a syringe. As used herein, clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) refers to 1) a single clinical attack suggestive of MS and 2) at least one lesion suggestive of MS. As an example, the patient has at least 1 cerebral lesion detectable by an MRI scan and suggestive of multiple sclerosis. As an additional example the lesion is associated with brain tissue inflammation, myelin sheath damage or axonal damage. As another example the lesion is a demyelinating white matter lesion visible on brain MRI. In a further example, the white matter lesions are at least 3 mm in diameter. The term "single clinical attack" is used synonymously with "first clinical episode", "first clinical attack", and "first clinical event" which, for example, presents as a clinical episode of optic neuritis, blurring of vision, diplopia, involuntary rapid eye movement, blindness, loss of balance, tremors, ataxia, vertigo, clumsiness of a limb, lack of coordination, weakness of one or more extremity, altered muscle tone, muscle stiffness, spasms, tingling, paraesthesia, burning sensations, muscle pains, facial pain, trigeminal neuralgia, stabbing sharp pains, burning tingling pain, slowing of speech, slurring of words, changes in rhythm of speech, dysphagia, fatigue, bladder problems (including urgency, frequency, incomplete emptying and incontinence), bowel problems (including constipation and loss of bowel control), impotence, diminished sexual arousal, loss of sensation, sensitivity to heat, loss of short term memory, loss of concentration, or loss of judgment or reasoning. As used herein, the criteria, as defined by Poser et al. Neurology, March 1983, 13 (3) : 227-230, used to determine if a subject meets the condition consistent with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) are: • Two attacks and clinical evidence of two separate lesions or • Two attacks; clinical evidence of one lesion and paraclinical evidence of another separate lesion. An attack (also referred to as an exacerbation, flare, or relapse,) is defined clinically as the sudden appearance or worsening of a symptom or symptoms of neurological dysfunction, with or without objective confirmation. Clinical evidence of a lesion is defined as signs of neurological dysfunction demonstrable by neurological examination. An abnormal sign constitutes clinical evidence even if no longer present, but was recorded in the past by a competent examiner. Paraclinical evidence of a lesion is defined as the demonstration by means of various tests and procedures of the existence of a lesion of the CNS that has not produced clinical signs but that may or may not have caused symptoms in the past. Such evidence may be derived from the hot-bath test, evoked response studies, neuroimaging, and expert neurological assessment. These tests are considered to be extensions of the neurological examination and not laboratory procedures. As used herein, the term "glatiramoid" refers a complex mixture of the acetate salts of synthetic polypeptides, non-uniform with respect to molecular weight and sequence. This invention is illustrated in the Examples section which follows. This section is set forth to aid in an understanding of the invention but is not intended to, and should not be construed to, limit in any way the invention as set forth in the claims which follow thereafter. Experimental Details Example 1: A multinational, multicenter, randomized, phase III parallel-group study performed in subjects with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Glatiramer Acetate (GA) injection 40mg/ml administered three times weekly by subcutaneous injection over placebo in a double-blind design.

Statistical Considerations: The sample size considerations for the study are based on the following assumptions: • An individual subject's number of confirmed relapses during a one year period reflects a Poisson process with an individual rate of λ1, and this individual subject rates λ1 are exponentially distributed with mean 1/θ, where θ is the population's annualized relapse rate. This approach models the total number of confirmed relapses as an Over Dispersed Poisson distribution. • The expected annualized relapse rate in an untreated subject population is θ=0.35 relapses per year. • Treatment with 40mg s.c. GA three times weekly reduces the subject population annualized relapse rate by 30% or more when compared to the placebo group. That is, the expected annualized relapse rate of the GA treated populations is θ=0.245 relapses per year or less. In addition, the following are also incorporated in the sample size calculation: 15% of the subjects drop out during the treatment duration. This drop out rate is taken into account in the calculations, as on the average, a subject who drops out of the study contributes 6 months of exposure to the treatment Hochberg's step-up modification to Bonferroni's method is used to maintain the experiment-wise type-I error when comparing multiple treatment arms to placebo, and the p-values for the IAs are calculated using the 0'brien-Fleming alpha spending functions. A simulation study accounting for the above underlying assumptions used the Quasi-Likelihood (over-dispersed) Poisson Regression (SAS® PROC GENMOD), revealed that a total of 1350 subjects (900 subjects in the 40mg GA arm, and 450 subjects to the placebo arm) provide approximately 90% power to detect a significant difference in the total number of confirmed relapses as described above. The analysis of the total numbers of confirmed relapses during the study period is based on baseline adjusted Quasi-Likelihood (over-dispersed) Poisson Regression. The analysis of the number of new T2 lesions at month 12 and of the cumulative number of enhancing lesions on Τΐweighted images taken at months 6 and 12 is based on baseline-adjusted Negative Binomial Regression. The analysis of Brain Atrophy will be based on Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). Results Primary Outcome Measure: Treatment with 40mg s.c.

Discussion A significant drawback to GA therapy is the requirement of daily injections, which can be inconvenient. Moreover, in all clinical trials, injection-site reactions were seen to be the most frequent adverse reactions and were reported by the majority of patients receiving GA. In controlled studies, the proportion of patients reporting these reactions, at least once, was higher following treatment with GA (70%) than placebo injections (37%) . The most commonly reported injection-site reactions, which were more frequently reported in GA vs. placebo-treated patients, were erythema, pain, mass, puritus, edema, inflammation and hypersensitivity. However, several obstacles and limitations with potential approaches for addressing the drawbacks exist to current GA therapy. Subcutaneous drug delivery is limited, firstly, by the acceptable injection volume. Typically no more than 1 to 2ml of solution is permitted (Kansara V, Mitra A, Wu Υ, Subcutaneous Delivery. Drug Deliv Technol, June 2009; 9(6):38-42). Secondly, the potential exists for drug degradation at the site of injection resulting in reduced bioavailability. Thirdly, based on the physiochemical properties of the drug, potent compounds may become locally trapped in the interstitial space which can lead to further localized irritation, precipitation of the drug and concentration-dependent adverse effects (Kansara V, Mitra A, Wu Υ, Subcutaneous Delivery. Drug Deliv Technol, June 2009; 9(6) : 38-42) . Finally, due to the complex pharmacokinetic behavior of a drug, variation in the frequency of administration is unpredictable and requires empirical testing. For example, although controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of IF^-lb in the treatment of MS, patient compliance, efficacy and tolerability are affected by the dosage regimen used. Merely increasing the dose of IF^-lb is insufficient to increase efficacy, the frequency of administration must also be increased (Luca Durelli, J Neurol (2003) 250 [Suppl 4]) . Accordingly, the subject application discloses an effective low frequency dosage regimen of GA administration to patients suffering from a relapsing form of multiple sclerosis, including patients who have experienced a first clinical episode and have MRI features consistent with multiple sclerosis. Based on the performance of the dosage regimen in these studies, the administration of three s.c. injections over a period of seven days with at least one day between every injection is also expected to work in the treatment of patients who have experienced a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) . This is based on the fact that the 20mg daily s.c. injection has been shown to work in PCT International Application No. PCT/US2008/013146 (see International Publication No. WO 2009/070298 and also U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2009-0149541 Α1). 1.
