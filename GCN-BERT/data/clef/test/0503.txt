No. 61/993,608 filed under 35 U.S.C. §111(b) on May 15, 2014, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH This invention was made with no government support. The government has no rights in this invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cancer remains the second most common cause of death, accounting for nearly 1 out of every 4 deaths in the United States. It is estimated that more than 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in the year 2014 alone. Aberrant epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is believed to result in tumorigenesis. Aberrant epigenetic silencing could occur as a result of changes in covalent modification of histone proteins. Enzymatic modifications such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation of the lysine side chains in the N-terminus of histones regulate the access to DNA by transcriptional factors, thereby regulating gene expression. Histone acetylation is modulated by two protein families, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a family of enzymes that catalyzes the de-acteylation of lysine amino acid side chains of histones in chromatin. HDACs remove the acetyl group from lysine residues of histone proteins to form a transcriptionally inactive condensed form of chromatin. This results in a closed, transcriptionally inactive chromatin state, which can result in silencing of tumor suppressor genes and promoting cancer initiation and/or progression. Thus, HDACs play an important role in gene expression. Inhibition of HDACs may be used to reactivate these undesirably silenced genes in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression without changing DNA sequences for developing anticancer agents. HDAC proteins are a family of at least 18 enzymes classified into four groups based on their size, cellular localization, active catalytic site numbers, and homology to yeast HDAC proteins: class I includes HDAC 1, -2, -3, and -8; class IIa includes HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9; class IIb includes HDAC6 and -10; class III includes sirtuin proteins; and class IV includes HDAC11. HDAC inhibitors reactivate silent tumor suppressor genes, resulting in cancer cell apoptosis. HDAC inhibitors block tumor cell proliferation by inducing cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and/or apoptosis, and these compounds make up some of the therapies currently approved or in clinical trials for cancer chemotherapy. Class I HDAC isoforms are regarded as promising cancer targets. Two HDAC inhibitors, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, Vorinostat), and FK228 (romidepsin), have been approved by the USFDA for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The compound SAHA, with a hydroxamic acid moiety as the metal binding domain, is a pan-inhibitor of HDACs, non-selective for all HDAC isoforms. FK228 is a class I selective inhibitor. The metal binding domain of FK228 is a thiol masked as a cyclic disulfide bond with a cysteine residue of the depsipeptide core. A number of other HDAC inhibitors are in different stages of clinical studies. However, there is a need for isoform-selective or class-selective inhibitors for higher therapeutic potential and reduced side effects. There is also a need for the development of more potent HDAC inhibitors, as well as HDAC inhibitors not prone to drug resistance. It would also be useful to synthesize selective HDAC inhibitors that are useful as probes to determine the physiological/pathogenic role of individual HDAC isoforms.

This has resulted in the targeting of enzymes responsible for these modifications being one therapeutic approach in cancer. Mechanisms of epigenetic silencing include DNA methylation and modification of key residues of histone tails. Lysine residues of histone tails can be acetylated/deacetylated, which can alter gene expression. Histone acetylation status is regulated by two enzymes, histone acetyl transferases (HAT), which acetylate lysine tails of histone proteins, and histone deacetylases (HDAC), which deacetylate them. HDAC inhibitor pharmacophores have three key structural elements: (a) a metal binding domain, which interacts with Zn2+ ions in the active site; (b) a surface recognition cap group, which interacts with hydrophobic residues on the rim of the active site; and (c) a linker, which occupies a hydrophobic channel, positioning the zinc binding moiety and the cap group in binding orientation and mimicking the N-acetyl lysine side chain of histone. Any one, two, or three of these three sectors may be targeted for structural alteration to achieve HDAC class and/isoform selectivity. However, in accordance with the present disclosure, the surface recognition cap group is believed to be the most amenable for such modification because it interacts with a less conserved region of the enzyme. The three structural elements are highlighted in largazole, FK228, and SAHA molecules in FIG. 2B. Largazole (1, FIGS. 1A-1B), a compound that was isolated in 2008 from a marine cyanobacterium of the genus Symploca, is a class I selective anticancer agent with potent HDAC inhibitory activity. Largazole possesses significant selective activity against highly invasive transformed human mammary epithelial cells (MDA-MB-231) and transformed fibroblastic osteosarcoma (USOS) cells over normal cell lines (NMuMG and NIH353, respectively). (FIG. 1B.) In fact, largazole is more selective than most well known anti-cancer agents like paclitaxel and doxorubicin. The anticancer activity of largazole has been shown to be mediated through the inhibition of histone deacetylases. At least 18 different isoforms of human HDAC proteins have been identified, but their specific roles in cellular function and physiology are still not well understood. However, specific HDAC isoforms over-expressed in some types of cancer can be targeted to develop selective anticancer agents. The USFDA approved the pan HDACi SAHA (vorinostat) for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in 2006. A second drug, FK 228 (romidepsin), approved by the USFDA in 2009 for the same human condition, is a class I specific inhibitor of HDAC. Both molecules incorporate the essential structural features of HDAC inhibitors and consist of a metal binding domain, a surface recognition cap, and a hydrophobic linker (FIGS. 2A-2B.) The metal binding domain of SAHA is a strongly metal-chelating hydroxamic acid moiety while that of FK 228 is a thiol group generated by in situ reduction of a disulfide bridge. The large hydrophobic depsipeptide cap group of FK 228 may contribute to its more class I selective properties by interacting with less conserved regions located further away than those reachable by the smaller benzamide cap group of SAHA in the rim of the active site. Notably, tubacin and other related compounds with structural similarities to SAHA, but having a large cap group, are more selective for HDAC6 than HDAC1, underscoring the importance of the nature of the cap group in discriminating between the HDAC isoforms. Largazole shares similar linker and zinc-binding groups with other related HDAC inhibitors such as FK228, FR901375, and spiruchostatins (FIG. 2). The zinc-binding thiol group in all of these HDAC inhibitors is masked in a prodrug form. Largazole's thioester group is hydrolyzed by cellular esterases (or lipases) to the free thiol, while in compounds 2, 3, and 4, the disulfide bridge gets reduced to free thiol by glutathione-mediated cellular reduction. Both largazole and FK228 are depispeptides, with the depsipeptide ring constituting the surface recognition cap group of both inhibitors. Both compounds also have identical linker groups and masked thiol groups as metal-binding motifs. A number of largazole analogues have been synthesized, and their HDAC inhibitory activities have revealed some of its structure-activity relationship (SAR) requirements. Changes in all three sectors of the molecule have been effected. For example, largazole analogues incorporating multiple heteroatoms as the metal binding domain have been synthesized. As HDAC proteins are associated with many basic cellular processes, and aberrant HDAC activity is also linked to human disorders other than cancer, the effect of largazole on other disease states is also being explored. However, largazole has been reported to have no effect on the viability of rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts. Similarly, it inhibited the expression of HDAC1 and HDAC5, but enhanced HDAC6 in synovial fibroblasts. Largazole and its derivatives have been reported to selectively inhibit ubiquitin activation enzyme (E1), but largazole decreases liver fibrosis and angiogenesis by inhibiting transforming growth factor-β and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling. The importance of thiol as the metal binding motif is evident from the lack or reduced activity of largazole analogues in which the thiol group is replaced with other groups such as benzamide, thiobenzamide, ketone, or esters functionalities, and with thioether-containing dual hetero atom combinations. For optimal activity, the linker between the metal binding motif and the depsipeptide ring has to be four atoms in length and should preferably have a trans vs cis double bond. Importantly, some structural alterations in the depsipeptide ring have been well tolerated. Replacement of sulfur atoms with oxygen atoms gives the oxazoline-oxazole analogue, which is equipotent with largazole, but the oxidation of the thizoline ring to the more stained thiazole-thiazole analogue results in reduced activity. Of note is the generation of the most potent HDACi known by replacing the thiazole ring with a pyridine ring. L-valine can be replaced with other amino acids without affecting affinity. Substitution of L-tyrosine, L-alanine, and glycine for L-valine is also well tolerated. The x-ray crystal structure of the largazole-HDAC8 complex shows that the valine side chain of largazole points directly out toward the solvent and has no effect on HDAC-largazole interaction. Therefore, without wishing to be bound by theory, the substitution of L-valine with other amino acids or even D-amino acids and disubstituted amino acids should be well tolerated provided they do not perturb the conformation of the macrocycle. The methyloxazoline-oxazole analogue of largazole shows slightly better activity than largazole. The HDAC8-largazole complex crystal structure shows that the 4-methylthiazoline-thiazole moiety interacts with the less conserved area in the rim of the binding pocket and faces toward the solvent. Bi-thiazole analogue 7, in which the thiazoline ring is replaced by a thiazole ring (FIG. 3), results in a 25-145-fold decrease in activity. The C-2 epimer of largazole retains reduced, but sub-micromolar, inhibitory potency against HDAC isoforms. However, the C-2 epimer has been found to be more potent than largazole in inhibiting the viability of prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3, and both upregulate the expression of p21. In accordance with the present disclosure, the lower sequence homology between different HDAC classes at the surface near the opening to the binding pocket can be exploited to design isoform-selective inhibitors. The region of the HDAC enzyme around the binding pocket consists of many grooves, which can be occupied differently by multiple cap groups to impact selectivity. This is underscored by the fact that the small cap group of SAHA interacts with the highly conserved region of the enzyme, and is unable to make contact with the variable region which is believed to be further away from the opening of the channel. The inability to interact with the variable region is believed to be responsible for its non-specificity. In contrast, the depsipeptide HDAC inhibitors (FK228, largazole) contain large and bulky recognition cap groups, which allow better interaction with the less conserved region of the surface area of the enzyme. Given that there are variations at the mouth of the active site of HDAC isoforms, structure-based modification of the largazole depsipeptide backbone can lead to molecules capable of isoform-specific inhibition, a thrust in HDAC inhibitor development. Provided herein are largazole analogues with modifications in the depsipeptide ring. The depsipeptide ring of largazole constitutes the surface recognition cap group that interacts with the less conserved hydrophobic rim of the HDAC active site. In particular, provided herein are largazole analogues in which the thiazole-thiazoline moiety of the surface recognition cap group is replaced with other structural variants. In particular examples, the thiazole-thiazoline moiety is replaced with different aromatic and alkyl groups. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) requirements for potency and isoform selectivity have been investigated through these analogues. In certain embodiments, these largazole analogues are histone deacetylase inhibitors with potent anticancer activity. As a non-limiting example, replacing the sp3 carbon at C7 of largazole with an sp2 carbon is tolerated and leads to biologically active molecules. The skilled practitioner will recognize that particular modifications to the thiazole-thiazoline moiety other than those specifically described herein are nonetheless encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure. As described in the examples herein, several analogues with modified surface recognition cap groups were synthesized, using a general synthetic approach, and evaluated for their biological activity. As non-limiting examples, these analogues include compounds in which the thiazoline ring is replaced with a methylamine moiety, benzylamine, substituted benzylamine, or napthylmethyl amine group. In certain embodiments, these replacements provide for greater hydrophobic interaction with the HDAC enzyme. FIG. 4A shows the structural formulas of nine non-limiting, specific examples of such analogues. The synthesis and biological activity of many specific variants of largazole analogues with modifications in the surface recognition cap group are described, but the skilled practitioner will recognize that various other largazole analogues are within the scope of the present disclosure. In certain embodiments, the analogues provided herein are depicted in FIG. 4A, and have the structural formula of Formula I or Formula II. Compounds of Formula I have the following structural formula: where dashed lines represent bonds that may be present or absent; X is either N or NR1; and R1 is selected from the group consisting of: methyl, aryl, alkaryl, hydrogen, and ether. The compound of Formula II is analogue JA1 and has the following structural formula: When a compound has the structure of Formula I, the dashed lines are present, and X is N, the compound is analogue JA2. When a compound has the structure of Formula I, the dashed lines are absent, and NR1 is methylamino-, the compound is analogue JA3. When a compound has the structure of Formula I, the dashed lines are absent, and NR1 is benzylamino-, the compound is analogue JA4. When a compound has the structure of Formula I, the dashed lines are absent, and NR1 is 4-(trifluromethyl)benzylamino-, the compound is analogue JA5. These analogues JA2-JA5 have the structural formulas denoted as Formula V, Formula VI, Formula VII, and Formula VIII, respectively. Further included in compounds of Formula I are compounds having the structural formula of Formula IV: where Z is selected from the group consisting of phenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl, 4-(trifluromethane)phenyl, 4-chlorophenyl, 1-napthyl, and 4-methylphenyl. When a compound has the structural formula of Formula IV, X is N, and Z is 4-chlorophenyl, the compound is analogue AA1. When a compound has the structural formula of Formula IV, X is N, and Z is phenyl, the compound is analogue JA4. When a compound has the structural formula of Formula IV, X is N, and Z is 4-(trifluromethane)phenyl, the compound is analogue JA5. When a compound has the structural formula of Formula IV, and Z is 4-methoxyphenyl, the compound is analogue JA6. When a compound has the structural formula of Formula IV, and Z is 1-napthyl, the compound is analogue AA2. When a compound has the structural formula of Formula IV, and Z is 4-methylphenyl, the compound is analogue RF1. Understanding how these compounds affect cellular HDAC activity is important. Therefore, the biological effects of all these analogues were evaluated. As described in the examples, the analogues JA1-JA6, AA1-AA2, and RF1 were tested in the NCI 60 cell line assay, which includes leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer, colon cancer, CNS cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer cell lines. These analogues showed significant activity on several different cancer cell lines. Analogues JA1 and JA3 showed anti-proliferative activity equivalent to largazole at 5 μM concentration, while showing less inhibitory activity at lower concentrations. Analogue JA2 is the most potent analogue, with higher anti-proliferative activity compared to largazole at concentrations greater than 0.1 μM. Methods of Making Analogues JA2-JA6, AA1-AA2, and RF1 Scheme 1 (FIG. 5) shows a non-limiting example of a convergent synthetic approach usable for the synthesis of largazole analogues. The retrosynthetic analysis consists of acyl transfer from fragment 8 to amines 9, followed by Yamaguchi esterification with Fmoc-valine Macrolactamization followed by thio-esterification gives the target largazole analogues. The synthesis of the amine moieties 9 is described in more detail for each specific analogue. Synthesis of Alcohol 8 The aldehyde 11 was prepared by an improved and more convenient procedure compared to previously reported methods. Aldehyde 14 was obtained by Michael addition of triphenylmethanethiol to acrolein using a previously developed procedure. Aldehyde 14 was reacted with (cyanomethyl)triphenylphosphorane in benzene under reflux at 90° C. to obtain the nitrile 15 (5:1, E:Z) (Scheme 2, FIG. 6). The nitrile mixture was reduced with DIBAL-H to obtain an E/Z mixture of the corresponding aldehyde 11, which was isomerized to the desired E isomer by slow passage through a silica column to obtain the E aldehyde 11 in 85% overall yield. Diastereoselective aldol reaction between the aldehyde 11 and acetyl Nagao auxillary 10, followed by flash chromatography purification of the diastereomeric mixture (6:1, S:R) on silica gel, gave the required diastereomer 8 in high yield (Scheme 2, FIG. 6). The S-configuration of the newly generated chiral center was confirmed by Mosher ester analysis. Synthesis of Analogue JA1 The synthesis of amine 18 is shown in Scheme 3 (FIG. 7). 2-(2-Aminoethoxyl)ethanol was reacted with Boc anhydride to obtain 12. Methyl bromoacetae was converted to methy iodoacete 16 by reaction with NaI and acetone (a Finkelstein reaction). The alcohol 12 was alkylated with methyl iodoacetate 16 in the presence of NaH in DMF to give the ester 17 in 78% yields. Removal of the Boc protecting group with trifluoroacetic acid/dichloromethane gave amine 18 as its TFA salt, which was used in the next step without purification. Acyl transfer from 8 to amine 18 was carried out in the presence of DMAP to obtain alcohol 19 (Scheme 4, FIG. 8). It was esterified with Fmoc-L-valine using Yamaguchi esterification conditions to afford the acyclic precursor 20 in 96% yield. Following methyl ester hydrolysis with aqueous LiOH and Fmoc group removal with diethylamine, cyclization to the macrocyclic depsipeptide ring was achieved using HOAt, HATU, and Hunig's base to give intermediate 21 in 65% yield over the last 3 steps. After the TFA-induced removal of the trityl group, the resulting thiol was dried azeotropically with toluene and esterified with octanoyl chloride in the presence of Hunig's base and DMAP. The desired product was purified by reversed phase chromatography on C18 in acetonitrile/water to obtain analogue JA1 in 83% yield over 2 steps. Synthesis of Bi-pyridine Analogue JA2 Commercially available 2-bromo-6-methylpyridine was reacted with Bu—Li, followed by trimethyltin chloride to obtain the corresponding trimethyltin intermediate, which was subjected to Stille coupling with 2,6-dibromopyridine in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst to give 6-bromo-6′-methyl-2,2′-bipyridine 22. A modified John's oxidation procedure using chromium oxide in concentrated sulfuric acid converted 22 to the carboxylic acid 23 in high yields (90%) (Scheme 5, FIG. 9). The reaction mixture was worked up with cold ice water to precipitate out the carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acid 23 was converted to the methyl ester 24 by reaction with methanol and sulfuric acid. Reaction of 24 with potassium cyanide in the presence of CuCN under microwave heating gave the corresponding nitrile 25 in high yield. Nitrile 25 was reduced to the methyl amine 26 by hydrogenation using palladium (5% Pd/C) as a catalyst. The final stage of the synthesis of analogue JA2 is shown in Scheme 6 (FIG. 10). Acyl transfer from 8 to amine 26 in the presence of Hunig's base and DMAP gave 27. Alcohol 27 was esterified with Fmoc-L-valine under Yamaguchi esterification conditions to afford the acyclic precursor 28 in 92% yield. Following hydrolysis of the methyl ester group with lithium hydroxide and removal of the Fmoc group with diethylamine, cyclization using HOAt, HATU, and Hunig's base gave the macrocyclic depsipeptide 29 in 45% yield over the last 3 steps. Removal of the trityl group with TFA followed by thioesterification of the resulting thiol with octanoyl chloride in the presence of Hunig's base and DMAP afforded analogue JA2 in 45% yield over 2 steps. An alternative procedure for preparing JA2 is further disclosed herein. Synthesis of Fragments 43-46 A dichloromethane suspension of 2,6-dihydroxymethyl pyridine 30, silver oxide, and potassium iodide was treated with tosyl chloride at −20° C. (Scheme 7, FIG. 11) to give predominantly the mono-tosylated product 31 with a trace amount of di-tosylated product. Mono-tosylated product 31 was separated by passing through a pad of silica gel in dicholormethane and was converted to azide 32 by heating with sodium azide in DMF. Tosylation of 32 using tosyl chloride and sodium hydroxide gave product 33 in almost quantitative yield. Nucleophilic displacement of the tosyl group with the appropriate amines was achieved by heating 33 and the respective amines 34-37 in the presence of potassium carbonate as base. The tertiary amines 38-41 were reduced with H2/Pd to give amines 42-45 in almost quantitative yield. Synthesis of Analogues JA3-JA6 The synthesis of analogues JA3-JA6 is shown in Scheme 8 (FIG. 12). Acyl transfer from 8 to the amines 42-45 was carried out in the presence of DMAP to obtain amides 46-49. The amides 46-49 were esterified with Fmoc-L-valine using Yamaguchi esterification conditions to afford acyclic precursor 50-53 in 92-96% yield. Following methyl ester hydrolysis with aqueous LiOH and Fmoc removal with diethylamine, cyclization to the macrocyclic depsipeptide ring was achieved using HOAt, HATU, and Hunig's base to give products 54-57. After removal of trityl group with TFA, the resulting thiol was dried azeotropically with toluene and esterified with octanoyl chloride in the presence of Hunig's base and DMAP. The desired products were purified by reversed phase chromatography on C18 in acetonitrile/water to obtain analogues JA3-JA6 in 65-83% yield over 2 steps. Synthesis of Analogues AA1-AA2 The synthesis of analogues AA1-AA2 and RF1 is shown in Schemes 9 and 10 (FIG. 13 and FIG. 14, respectively). Esterification of bromoacetic acid with 2-trimetylsilylethyl alcohol, followed by the reaction of the resulting ester with substituted benzyl amines 58 and 60 and 1-(aminomethyl)-naphthalene 59 gave the corresponding nucleophilic substitution products 61-63. The products 61-63 were reacted with tosylate 33 to obtain the tertiary amines 64-66. The azide group was reduced by catalytic hydrogenation to obtain the primary amines 67-69. Acyl transfer from 8 to amines 67-69 gave the intermediates 70-72, which were subjected to Yamaguchi esterification with Fmoc-valine to obtain acyclic intermediates 73-75 (Scheme 10, FIG. 14). Both Fmoc and trimethylsilylethyl protecting groups were removed simultaneously with TBAF, and the product was obtained in a high degree of purity by partitioning between water and ethyl acetate, removing ethyl acete under reduced pressure, and washing the residue with hexane. It was used in the next step without further purification. Alternative Procedure for Synthesizing Analogue JA2 The cyclic intermediate 29 in the synthesis of compound JA2 was resynthesized in improved yields using a modified protocol as shown in Scheme 11 (FIG. 15). Hydrolysis of the methyl ester group of 25 gave the carboxylic acid 82, which was converted to the trimethylsilylethyl ester 83. Reduction of the azide group of 83 gave the amine 84, which was subjected to acyl transfer with 8 to obtain the amide 85. Yamaguchi esterification of 85 with Fmoc-valine gave the acyclic precursor 86. Removal of trimethylsilylethyl and Fmoc protecting groups with TBAF followed by cyclization with HATU and HOAt as before gave the cyclic intermediate 29. It was converted to JA2 as described before.

In certain embodiments, a composition herein and/or additional agent is formulated to be administered via an alimentary route. Alimentary routes include all possible routes of administration in which the composition is in direct contact with the alimentary tract. Specifically, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be administered orally, buccally, rectally, or sublingually. As such, these compositions may be formulated with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or they may be enclosed in hard- or soft-shell gelatin capsules, they may be compressed into tablets, or they may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet. In further embodiments, a composition described herein may be administered via a parenteral route. As used herein, the term “parenteral” includes routes that bypass the alimentary tract. Specifically, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be administered, for example but not limited to, intravenously, intradermally, intramuscularly, intraarterially, intrathecally, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneally (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,753,514, 6,613,308, 5,466,468, 5,543,158; 5,641,515; and 5,399,363 are each specifically incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). Solutions of the compositions disclosed herein as free bases or pharmacologically acceptable salts may be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant, such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions may also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof, and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations may contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions (U.S. Pat. No. 5,466,468, specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In some cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy injectability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and should be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (i.e., glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and/or vegetable oils. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion, and/or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, such as, but not limited to, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption such as, for example, aluminum monostearate or gelatin. For parenteral administration in an aqueous solution, for example, the solution should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal administration. In this connection, sterile aqueous media that can be employed will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. For example, one dosage may be dissolved in 1 mL of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 mL of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion, (see for example, “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences” 15th Edition, pages 1035-1038 and 1570-1580). Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The person responsible for administration will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the compositions in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized compositions into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, some methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. A powdered composition is combined with a liquid carrier such as, but not limited to, water or a saline solution, with or without a stabilizing agent. In other embodiments, the compositions may be formulated for administration via various miscellaneous routes, for example, topical (i.e., transdermal) administration, mucosal administration (intranasal, vaginal, etc.) and/or via inhalation. Pharmaceutical compositions for topical administration may include the compositions formulated for a medicated application such as an ointment, paste, cream, or powder. Ointments include all oleaginous, adsorption, emulsion, and water-soluble based compositions for topical application, while creams and lotions are those compositions that include an emulsion base only. Topically administered medications may contain a penetration enhancer to facilitate adsorption of the active ingredients through the skin. Suitable penetration enhancers include glycerin, alcohols, alkyl methyl sulfoxides, pyrrolidones, and luarocapram. Possible bases for compositions for topical application include polyethylene glycol, lanolin, cold cream, and petrolatum, as well as any other suitable absorption, emulsion, or water-soluble ointment base. Topical preparations may also include emulsifiers, gelling agents, and antimicrobial preservatives as necessary to preserve the composition and provide for a homogenous mixture. Transdermal administration of the compositions may also comprise the use of a “patch.” For example, the patch may supply one or more compositions at a predetermined rate and in a continuous manner over a fixed period of time. In certain embodiments, the compositions may be delivered by eye drops, intranasal sprays, inhalation, and/or other aerosol delivery vehicles.

Likewise, transmucosal drug delivery in the form of a polytetrafluoroetheylene support matrix is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,045 (specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), and could be employed to deliver the compositions described herein. It is further envisioned the compositions disclosed herein may be delivered via an aerosol. The term aerosol refers to a colloidal system of finely divided solid or liquid particles dispersed in a liquefied or pressurized gas propellant. The typical aerosol for inhalation consists of a suspension of active ingredients in liquid propellant or a mixture of liquid propellant and a suitable solvent. Suitable propellants include hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon ethers. Suitable containers will vary according to the pressure requirements of the propellant. Administration of the aerosol will vary according to subject's age, weight and the severity and response of the symptoms.
