Step 5: 2-((3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1 H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl 2-(2-methyl-1 H-indol-1-yl)acetate
To a solution of 2-(2-methyl-1 H-indol-1-yl)acetic acid (54.7 mg, 289 µmol) in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (4 mL) was added DCC (59.9 mg, 290 µmol), DMAP (8 mg, 65 µmol) and N-(3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1 H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyacetamide (71.0 mg, 290 µmol) at 0 °C under argon. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and for 18 h. The reaction mixture was filtered over cotton, washed with NH4Cl (2 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Purification by column chromatography (75% EtOAc in petroleum ether) gave 98 mg (81%) of the title compound
