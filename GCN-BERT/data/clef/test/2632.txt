INHIBITORS The present invention relates to compounds that are useful as inhibitors of the activity of Wee-1 kinase. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and to methods of using these compounds in the treatment of cancer and methods of treating cancer. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION Cells are continually challenged on a daily basis, resulting in multiple lesions forming in DNA. The lesions, if not repaired, can lead to mutations or cell death, thus complex signalling networks exist which ensure that lesions are detected, and repaired to maintain the integrity of DNA. Detection of DNA damage initiates a series of events which are key in maintaining the genome. Cell cycle checkpoints are designed to stop the cell cycle and allow repair of the lesion before allowing the cell to continue into mitosis. Two key checkpoints have been identified, one at the end of G1 phase and the second at G2, which work in tandem to ensure all lesions, are identified and repaired. In 50% of human cancers the G1 checkpoint is non-functional due to mutations in the tumour suppressor gene ρ53. However, the G2 check-point is seldomly mutated, and often found to be activated in cancer cells. Cancer cells exploit this to confer resistance to treatment modalities including DNA damaging agents and radiation. Three kinases have been identified as key regulators of the G2 checkpoint, namely Chkl, Chk2 and Wee-1. Inhibitors for the kinases are currently in clinical trials. Wee-1 is a nuclear tyrosine kinase, which negatively regulates entry into mitosis, at the G2/M check-point by catalysing a phosphorylation of the cdc2 / cyclin Β kinase complex. The phosphorylation occurs on the Tyrosine 15 residue and leads to the inactivation of cdc2 / cyclin Β complex ultimately preventing mitosis. Wee-1 function is intimately linked to that of Chkl and Chk2 due to their phosphorylation and inactivation of cdc25 on serine 216, as well as the reported activation of Wee-1 by Chk 1 & 2 (Ashwell et al., 2012, DNA Repair in Cancer Therapy, DOI: 10.1016/Β978-0-12-384999-1.10010-1). Wee-1 is downstream of the Chk family and is a crucial component of the checkpoint signalling cascade as it prevents cells from entering mitosis if lesions are detected. Commonly administered anti-cancer compounds induce DNA damage; including anti-metabolites, platiniums, topoisomerase inhibitors and alkylating agents. However, their efficacy is limited due to excessive toxicity, resistance and lack of tumour selectivity. Compounds which work in combination with these agents to prevent DNA repair selectively in tumour cells would be extremely beneficial. The tumour suppressor gene ρ53 is commonly mutated in tumour cell lines, therefore the administration of a Wee-1 kinase inhibitor, which will abrogate the G2 check point, may lead to increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. The potential for this has been reported, silencing of Wee-1 activity was sufficient to sensitize HeLa cells to doxorubicin due to abrogation of G2 arrest. In contrast, in normal breast epithelium which have a fully complement ρ53, the removal of Wee-1 function had little additional effect compared to doxorubicin alone (Wang et al. ,2004, Cancer Biology and Therapy, 3(3), 305-313). It has been reported that cell lines harbouring mutations in the tumour suppressor gene ρ53 have increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents when co-administered with Wee-1 small molecule inhibitors. In vitro and in vivo efficacy has been reported when small molecule inhibitors are combined with gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, carboplatin, cisplatin (Hirai et al 2010, Cancer Biology & Therapy 9:7, 514-522), cytarabine (Tibes et al., 2012, Blood, 119(12), 2863-2872) and Src inhibitors (Cozzi et al., 2012, Cell Cycle 11(5), 1-11). Single agent apoptotic efficacy, independent of ρ53 status, has been reported in sarcoma cell lines and in patient derived sarcoma samples (Kreahling et al., 2012, Mol. Cancer Ther., 11(1), 174-182). Irradiation is known to increase phosphorylation of the Tyrl5 and Thrl4 residues of cdc2, leading to a radioresistant phenotype. Inhibition of Wee-1 activity by small molecules (Wang et al., 2004, Cancer Biology and Therapy 3(3), 305-313) leads to a reduction in phosphorylation and radiosensitization effect, with the effect more pronounced in ρ53 mutant cell lines. Compounds having a kinase inhibitory effect, for example a Wee-1 kinase inhibitory effect, are described in WO Chem. Lett., 2005, 15, 1931-1935 describe various compounds such as dihydropyrimidopyrimidine and pyridopyrimidinone derivatives having a kinase inhibitory effect. In particular, the compounds of WO 2005/090344 are said to show activity as protein kinase inhibitors, in particular Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The compounds described in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2005, 15, ρ1931-1935 are said to be 10-100-fold more potent inhibitors of c-Src than Wee-1, and variation of substituents on the 6-phenyl ring does not markedly alter this preference. It is said that solubilizing substituents off the 2-anilino ring in many cases increases Wee-1 activity, lowering this preference to about 10-fold. 5-Alkyl substituted analogues are said to be generally Wee-1 selective, but at the expense of absolute potency. WO 2013/013031 describes pyridazino[4,5-d]pyrimidin-(6Η)-one inhibitors of Wee-1 kinase which are said to be useful for inhibiting kinases such as Wee-1 and in methods of treating diseases such as cancer. Compounds within the scope of disclosure of WO 2013/013031 have a nitrogen atom at the '3-position' of the ring relative to the carbonyl group. US 2013/0018045 describes various tricyclic 2 - sulfonamide compounds which are useful for inhibiting kinases such as Wee-1 and methods of treating diseases such as cancer. Compounds within the scope of disclosure of US 2013/0018045 have a sulfonamide group at the '1-position' on the ring and the atoms at the '3- and '4-positions' form part of a fused aryl or heteroaryl ring (A). It is one object of the present invention to overcome at least some of the disadvantages of the prior art or to provide a commercially useful alternative thereto. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a compound having an improved selectivity towards Wee-1 kinase compared to known compounds or compositions.

Other preferred embodiments of the compounds according to the invention appear throughout the specification and in particular in the examples. Particularly preferred are those named compounds having greater activity as tested. Compounds having higher activity are more preferred over those having lower activity. The present inventors have surprisingly found that the compounds of the present invention show an improved selectivity towards Wee-1 kinase. Preferably, in particular, the compounds of the invention are selective over members of the Src family of kinases, for example LCK (Lymphocyte specific protein tyrosine kinase) and c-Src. Unexpectedly, the compounds of the present invention also appear to show greater selectivity than a representative compound described in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2005, 15, 1931-1935 (see Examples) and compounds described in WO 2013/013031 and US 2013/0018045. The present inventors have surprisingly found that the compounds of the present invention also show reduced or comparable hERG inhibition, improved or comparable human liver microsome stability and reduced or comparable CVS toxicity compared to the kinase inhibitors of the prior art. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is thought that the compounds of the present invention tend to show an improved selectivity over other off-target kinases due, at least in part, to the position of the carbonyl (C=0) group as shown in formula (I), that is, the carbonyl group adjacent to the nitrogen atom to which R1 is attached. Further factors which result in the improved selectivity over other off-target kinases, as well as improved hERG activity values, improved human liver microsome stability and reduced CVS toxicity, include the structural relationship between the carbonyl (C=0) group, the N-R1 group at the '2-position' on the ring, the C-H at the '3-position' and the C-R2 group at the '4-position'. For example, representative compounds of the present invention have surprisingly been found to exhibit reduced hERG inhibition and reduced CVS toxicity compared to equivalent compounds within the scope of WO 2013/013031 which have a nitrogen atom at the '3-position' on the ring: Η Example 7 of the present invention Wee1/pCDC2 IC50 (ηΜ): 3.3 / 49.7 hERG IC50 (μΜ): 5.8 KSol (μΜ): 174 (avg. 157/190) Comparative Example 1 (cf.

In particular, the compounds of the present invention preferably show an improved or similar Wee-1 kinase-inhibitory effect compared to known compounds or compositions. Preferably, the compounds of the present invention have an improved stability in human microsomes e.g. human liver microsomes and/or an improved tolerability and/or reduced hERG inhibition and/ reduced CVS toxicity compared to known compounds or compositions.

In addition, the compounds of the present invention may be provided as a pro-drug. Pro-drugs are transformed, generally in vivo, from one form to the active forms of the drugs described herein. For example, a prodrug may be formed by protecting the -Ν-Η group to which R3 is attached with a hydrolysable group that gives -ΝΗ on hydrolysis. Alternatively or additionally, any -ΝΗ group within the compound may be protected as a physiological hydrolyzable amide. In addition, it will be understood that the elements described herein may be the common isotope or an isotope other than the common isotope. For example, a hydrogen atom may be 1H, 2H (deuterium) or 3H (tritium) . In addition, the compounds of the present invention may be provided in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or as co-crystals. For example, the compounds may be provided having protonated amine groups. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to ionic compounds formed by the addition of an acid to a base. The term refers to such salts that are considered in the art as being suitable for use in contact with a patient, for example in vivo and pharmaceutically acceptable salts are generally chosen for their non-toxic, non-irritant characteristics. The term "co-crystal" refers to a multi- component molecular crystal, which may comprise non-ionic interactions. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts and co-crystals may be prepared by ion exchange chromatography or by reacting the free base or acidic form of a compound with stoichiometric amounts or with an excess of the desired salt-forming inorganic or organic acid or base in one or more suitable solvents, or by mixing the compound with another pharmaceutically acceptable compound capable of forming a co-crystal. Salts known in the art to be generally suitable for use in contact with a patient include salts derived from inorganic and / or organic acids, including the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, nitrate, acetate, oxalate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate and tartrate. These may include cations based on the alkali and alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, as well as ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium. Further reference is made to the number of literature sources that survey suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts, for example the Handbook of pharmaceutical salts published by IUPAC.

General Experimental Conditions Solvents and reagents Common organic solvents that were used in reactions (e.g. THF, DMF, DCM, and methanol) were purchased anhydrous from Sigma-Aldrich° in Sure/Seal™ bottles and were handled appropriately under nitrogen. Water was deionised using an Elga PURELAB Option-Q. All other solvents used (i.e. for work-up procedures and purification) were generally HPLC grade and were used as supplied from various commercial sources. Unless otherwise stated, all starting materials used were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as supplied. Microwave synthesis Unless quoted otherwise, microwave experiments were carried out using a CEM Discover™/Explorer24™ system controlled by Synergy 1.5 software. In other cases a Biotage Initiator™ Eight was used. Both machines give good reproducibility and control at temperature ranges from 60-250°C and pressures of up to maximum of 20 bar. Flash chromatography Purification of compounds by flash chromatography was achieved using a Biotage Isolera Four system. Unless otherwise stated, Biotage KP-Sil SNAP cartridge columns (10-340 g) were used along with the stated solvent system and an appropriate solvent gradient depending on compound polarity. In the case of more polar and basic compounds, Biotage ΚΡ-ΝΗ SNAP cartridge columns (11 g) were used. NMR spectroscopy 1H NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature using a Bruker Avance (500ΜΗζ) spectrometer. All chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in ppm. Residual solvent signals were used as an internal standard and the characteristic solvent peaks were corrected to the reference data outlined in J. Org. Chem., 1997, 62, ρ7512-7515; in other cases, NMR solvents contained tetramethylsilane, which was used as an internal standard.

Immediately before the continuation of the assay, the sample plate was thawed and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min and the supernatant transferred to secondary tubes or 96 well plate. Cell supernatant was mixed in a ratio of 1:1 with sample dilutent buffer and vortexed for one minute. 100 pL of diluted sample was pipetted into pre-coated plates containing a rabbit polyclonal antibody for phospho-cdc2 (Tyrl5) (Cell Signalling Technologies PathScan kit #7176). The plate was sealed and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plate seal was removed and the well contents aspirated, followed by 3x5 min washes with 200 pL of diluted wash buffer. Between each wash the plate was tapped firmly onto blotting paper to ensure the removal of all kit solution. 100 pL of kit detection antibody was added to each well and the plate re-sealed and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Post incubation the plate was washed and processed in a similar manner to that previously described. 100 pL of horseradish peroxidise-linked secondary antibody was added to each test well, the plate sealed and incubated for thirty minutes at 37°C. Post incubation, the plate was washed as previously stated, followed by the addition of 100 pL of 3,3',5,5' tetramethylbenzidine (ΤΜΒ reagent).
