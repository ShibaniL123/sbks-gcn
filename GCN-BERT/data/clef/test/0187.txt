Step 3 Synthesis of Compound 131
Under ice-cooling, to Compound 130 (1.40 g, 3.01 mmol) in ethyl acetate (10 mL) solution were added triethylamine (2.09 mL, 15.1 mmol) and methanesulfonyl chloride (0.939 mL, 12.1 mmol), the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. Saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by diol silica gel column chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 131 (860 mg, 53% yield) as yellow foam.
