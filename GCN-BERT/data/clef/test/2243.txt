FORM 2 THE PATENT ACT 1970 (39 OF 1970) THE PATENT RULES, 2003 TITLE OF THE INVENTION: "RECLAMATION OF SILLICON FROM THE REJECTED WAFERS SOLAR CELLS" APPLICANTS M/s. MOSER BAER INDIA LIMITED, NO 81 Valluvarkottam Road, Nungambakkam, Chennai PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION: Provisional Specifications The following specification particularly describes the invention FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to reclamation of silicon and in particular to the process of reclamation of silicon from the rejected wafers and solar cells. Advantageously, the present invention is directed to the process of reclamation of silicon from rejected wafer and cell without taking recourse to any manual sifting involving manual separation of the screen-printed rejects from non-screen printed rejects. The invention is thus directed to a simple and cost-effective process for the stated reclamation of silicon which would not involve the arduous process and meet the required need in the art of a process of reclamation without any manual and complex sifting process. BACKGROUND ART It is well known that Polysilicon constitutes 25% of the crystalline silicon cell cost. In view of the unprecedented growth of photovoltaic industry in last couple of years and polysilicon industry not keeping pace with it has resulted in the shortage. This shortage is likely to continue for some more years. For example, the cell capacity is expected to be 2 GW in 2006 using 19000 tons of silicon in quantity. The projected demand for silicon was 25000 tons leaving 6000 tons of shortfalls. This has increased the polysilicon price by 100% in recent times. If we consider typical yield of 95% for the cell manufacturing lines, slightly more than 1000 tons of silicon is wasted as reject at the 2 GW annual capacities. Reclamation of rejects can, therefore, reduce the shortfall to some extent and alleviate the present day situation. The rejects of silicon cell come from different process stages. Thus, the quality of the waste or reject is not uniform. Some rejects will have metal contacts on the cells, whereas the others will be without screen-printing. The present day technique is to separate the screen-printed rejects from the nonprinted cells manually. This is an arduous process and calls for development of a process which does away with the manual sifting. Moreover, the broken wafer and cells not only have silicon but also screen printed sides consisting of silver, aluminum and constituents of glass such as silica, alkali metals, etc. Melting rejected cells and wafers will not give high purity silicon, six nine purity (99.9999) as the metallic impurities will enter the crystal lattice. It is, therefore, imperative to employ a process that can separate the impurities from the silicon. In the conventional process, impure silicon is digested in an inorganic acid like hydrochloric acid. The resulting mono-chlorosilane or trichloro-silane is distilled and vaporized to separate it from the impurities. This gas is deposited in a Siemens reactor, which has heated silicon rods (1000-1100 degree Celsius) or in the Fluidized Bed reactor (FBR) having heated silicon granules. This process is found to be capital intensive as well as energy intensive. ' OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is thus the basic object of the present invention to develop a process for reclamation of silicon from the mixed solar cell line waste without taking recourse to manual sifting: Another object of the invention is to develop the reclamation process that is not capital or energy intensive and further would not employ hazardous chemicals. A further object of the present invention is directed to a simple and costeffective process for the reclamation of silicon from the mixed solar cell line waste without taking recourse to manual sifting which can be provide pure silicon which can be further directionally solidified to obtain the desired grain orientation for use of the recovered silicon in solar cell application. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the reclamation of silicon from mixed solar cell line waste comprising: cleaning the silicon wafer/cell by digesting in hot hydrochloric acid to thereby generate variety of chlorides including silicon chloride (SiCI 4 ) having different vapour pressures; contacting the SiCl 4 thus obtained with zinc fumes to thereby obtain the required silicon as solid. In accordance with a preferred aspect of the invention the process for the reclamation of silicon from mixed solar cell line waste comprises: cleaning the silicon wafer/cell by digesting in hot hydrochloric acid to thereby generate variety of chlorides including silicon chloride (SiCI 4 ) having different vapour pressures; contacting the SiCI 4 thus obtained with zinc fumes to thereby obtain the required silicon as solid; melting and further purifying the recovered silicon following conventional methods. In accordance with yet another preferred aspect of the invention there is provided the process for the reclamation of silicon from mixed solar cell line waste comprising: cleaning the silicon wafer/cell by digesting in hot hydrochloric acid to thereby generate variety of chlorides including silicon chloride (SiCI 4 ) having different vapour pressures; contacting the SiCI 4 thus obtained with zinc fumes to thereby obtain the required silicon as solid; melting and further purifying the recovered silicon following conventional methods; and subjecting the pure silicon thus obtained to directional solidification to thereby obtain the desired grain orientation for use in solar cells. In the method proposed herein the rejected silicon wafer/cell is first cleaned by washing with water. The cleaned silicon wafer/cell is digested in hot hydrochloric acid. This results in dissolution of silicon as well as other metals like aluminum and silver and the method advantageously utilizes the difference in the various chloride vapour pressure to separate the silicon chloride from the rest of the other chlorides in the liquor. Besides the difference in the vapor pressure, the process of the invention makes further advantageous use of different affinity of chlorine for different elements to effect the reclamation of silicon. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, zinc fumes are brought in contact with SiCI 4 to obtain silicon as solid. According to a further aspect, the recovered silicon can be melted and further purified by one of the known methods like slag entrapment of impurities or electrolysis or partial solidification of melt and discarding the remaining impurity rich melt. Furthermore, the pure silicon can be directionally solidified to obtain the desired grain orientation for use in solar cell application. The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustrations and the following accompanying figure: BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURE: Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of Silicon recovery process from SiCI, in accordance with the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION IN RELATION TO ACCOMAPNAYING FIGURE: As already discussed the broken wafer and cells not only have silicon but also screen printed sides consisting of silver, aluminum and constituents of glass such as silica, alkali metals, etc. Melting rejected cells and wafers will not give high purity silicon, six nine purity (99.9999) as the metallic impurities will enter the crystal lattice. It is, therefore, imperative to employ a process that can separate the impurities from the silicon. The present process avoids the capital and energy intensive conventional process as detailed hereunder. In the method proposed herein the rejected silicon wafer/cell is first cleaned by washing with water. The cleaned silicon wafer/cell is digested in hot hydrochloric acid. This results in dissolution of silicon as well as other metals like aluminum and silver. The various chlorides formed in the liquor have different vapour pressures. The boiling point of various chlorides, which is a direct measure of the vapour pressures, is given in the Table 1. Table 1 Boiling point of the possible impurity chlorides in silicon reject Chloride Boiling Point(°C) SiCI 4 57 AICI 3 180 ZnCI 2 732 AgCI 1564 NaCI 1445 KCI 1407 Besides the difference in the vapor pressure, chlorine has different affinity for different elements. For instance, the chlorine has higher affinity for zinc than silicon. For each mole of chlorine the free energy of formation of SiCI 4 at 1000°C is -49 kcal, whereas it is -67 kcal for ZnCI 2 . Since free energy of formation for zinc is more negative, zinc can reduce SiCI 4 . There are a number of other metals that can also reduce SiCI 4 . However, zinc is a preferred choice as it is quite easy to vaporize zinc due to its high vapour pressure. Thus, zinc fumes when brought in contact with SiCI 4 can give silicon as solid. Since other impurities like silver and alkali metals have very high vapour pressure, they will not be evaporated along with SiCI 4 . Impurities like AI, which get converted to AICI 3 is not trapped in silicon because Zn cannot reduce AICI 3 . The free energy of formation of AICI 3 at 1000°C for per mole of chlorine is -80 kcal as opposed to -67 kcal for ZnCI 2 . The AICI 3 impurity, therefore, remains trapped in the ZnCI 2 . A schematic of set-up for the purpose is given in fig.1. The recovered silicon can be melted and further purified by one of the known methods like slag entrapment of impurities or electrolysis or partial solidification of melt and discarding the remaining impurity rich melt. Furthermore, the pure silicon can be directionally solidified to obtain the desired grain orientation for use in solar cell application. Optionally, this process can also be adopted for obtaining high purity silicon from the metallurgical grade silicon. The metallurgical grade silicon has on an average 98.5% purity and is presently purified by fractional distillation of chlorosilane. It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide for a method for reclamation of silicon from rejected wafer and cell without taking recourse to manual sifting. The process as disclosed above is found to be less capital/energy -intensive process for silicon refining and would further meet the need in the art for a cost-effective and energy efficient reclamation of silicon from the rejected wafers and solar cells.
