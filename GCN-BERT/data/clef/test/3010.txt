Example 18A
ent-Benzyl {1-[({7-[(2,6-difluorobenzyl)oxy]-2,5-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-3-yl}carbonyl)amino]-2-methyl-4-(trimethylsilyl)butan-2-yl}carbamate trifluoroacetate (Enantiomer A)
75 mg (0.19 mmol, purity 84%) of 7-[(2,6-difluorobenzyl)oxy]-2,5-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxylic acid from Example 4A were initially charged together with 94 mg (0.25 mmol) of HATU and 99 Î¼l (0.57 mmol) of N,N-diisopropylethylamine in 0.62 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 min. Subsequently, 78 mg (0.25 mmol) of ent-benzyl-[1-amino-2-methyl-4-(trimethylsilyl)butan-2-yl]carbamate (enantiomer A) from Example 15A were added to the reaction solution and the mixture was stirred at RT overnight. 7 ml of water were then added to the mixture. The precipitate formed was filtered off, diluted with acetonitrile and water, TFA was added and the mixture was purified by preparative HPLC (RPI8 column, mobile phase: acetonitrile/water gradient with addition of 0.1% TFA). The product fractions were combined and concentrated. This gave 70 mg of the target compound (50% of theory).
