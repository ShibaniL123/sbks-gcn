Step 3: 6-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydropyrrolo[3',4':3,4]pyrazolo[1,5-b][1,2] thiazine-1,1 dioxide
Tert-butyl 2-(3-chloropropylsulfonyl)-3-iodo-4,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole-5(2H)-carboxylate (230 mg, 0.48 mmol), zinc powder (126 mg, 1.93 mmol), a solution of zinc chloride in tetrahydrofuran (0.5 M, 1.93 mL, 0.97 mmol) and tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) were added into a microwave reaction tube, and purged with nitrogen for 5 minutes. The reaction was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere at 100 °C by microwave heating for 1.5 hours. After cooling, tetrakis (triphenylphosphine) palladium (56 mg, 0.048 mmol) was added, and purged with nitrogen for 5 minutes. The reaction was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere at 100 °C by microwave heating for 2 hours. After filtration, the filtrate was evaporated and concentrated, and then the residue was separated by silica gel column chromatography to give the product 6-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydropyrrolo[3',4':3,4]pyrazolo[1,5-b][1,2]thiazine-1,1-dioxide (23 mg). Yield: 15%.
