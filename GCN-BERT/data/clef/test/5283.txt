THIOCHROMENE DERIVATIVES AS HIF HYDROXYLASE INHIBITORS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) of United States Provisional Application Serial No. 61/114,971filed on November 14, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Field of the Invention [0002] The present invention relates to novel compounds, methods, and compositions capable of decreasing HIF hydroxylase enzyme activity, thereby increasing the stability and/or activity of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). State of the Art [0003] Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS (Per/Arnt/Sim) transcriptional activator that mediates changes in gene expression in response to changes in cellular oxygen concentration. HIF is a heterodimer containing an oxygen-regulated a-subunit (HIFa), and a constitutively expressed P-subunit (HIFp/ARNT). In oxygenated (normoxic) cells, HIFa subunits are rapidly degraded by a mechanism that involves ubiquitination by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) Ε3 ligase complex. Under hypoxic conditions, HIFa is not degraded, and an active HIFa/p complex accumulates in the nucleus, and activates the expression of several genes including glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters, erythropoietin (ΕΡΟ), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). (Jiang et al. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271:17771-17778; Iliopoulus et al. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93:10595-10599; Maxwell et al. (1999) Nature 399:271-275; Sutter et al. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:4748-4753; Cockman et al. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275:25733-25741; and Tanimoto et al. (2000) ΕΜΒΟ J. 19:4298-4309.) [0004] Levels of HIFa are elevated in most cells in response to hypoxia, and HIFa is induced in vivo when animals are subjected to anemia or hypoxia. HIFa levels rise within a few hours after the onset of hypoxia, and induce numerous beneficial cellular processes including cytoprotective effects, enhanced erythropoiesis, and physiological adaptation to ischemic or hypoxic states. Induction of HIFa is potentially beneficial in conditions such as heart attack, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, chronic ischemia, inflammation, and anemia. [0005] HIFa levels are also increased by a number of factors that mimic hypoxia, including iron chelators such as desferrioxamine (DFO), and divalent metal salts such as CoCl2. Additionally, several compounds originally identified as inhibitors of procollagen prolyl hydroxylase enzymes have been found to stabilize HIFa. Examples of such compounds can be found, e.g., in Majamaa et al. (1984) Eur. J. Biochem. 138:239-245; Majamaa et al. (1985) Biochem. J. 229:127-133; Kivirikko, and Myllyharju (1998) Matrix Biol. 16:357-368; Bickel et al. (1998) Hepatology 28:404-411; Friedman et al. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:4736-4741; Franklin (1991) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 19):812-815; and Franklin et al. (2001) Biochem. J. 353:333-338. Additionally, compounds that inhibit HIF hydroxylases have been described in, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 03/049686, WO 02/074981, WO 03/080566, WO 2004/108681, WO 2006/094292, WO 2007/038571, WO 2007/070359, WO 2007/090068, WO 2007/103905, WO 2007/115315, WO 2007/136990, WO 2007/150011, WO 2008/076425, WO 2008/076427, WO 2008/089051, WO 2008/089052, WO 2008/130600, WO 2008/130508, WO 2008/137084, WO 2008/137060, WO 2009/039321, WO 2009/039322, WO 2009/039323, WO 2009/049112, WO 2009/070644, W02009/073497, WO 2009/073669, WO 2009/073669, and WO 2009/086044.

Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures. [0141] Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. Suitable protecting groups for various functional groups as well as suitable conditions for protecting and deprotecting particular functional groups are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups are described in Τ. W. Greene and G. Μ. Wuts (1999) Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, Wiley, New York, and references cited therein. [0142] Furthermore, the compounds of this invention may contain one or more chiral centers. Accordingly, if desired, such compounds can be prepared or isolated as pure stereoisomers, i.e., as individual enantiomers or diastereomers, or as stereoisomer-enriched mixtures. All such stereoisomers (and enriched mixtures) are included within the scope of this invention, unless otherwise indicated. Pure stereoisomers (or enriched mixtures) may be prepared using, for example, optically active starting materials or stereoselective reagents well-known in the art. Alternatively, racemic mixtures of such compounds can be separated using, for example, chiral column chromatography, chiral resolving agents, and the like. [0143] The starting materials for the following reactions are generally known compounds or can be prepared by known procedures or obvious modifications thereof. For example, many of the starting materials are available from commercial suppliers such as Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA), Bachem (Torrance, California, USA), Emka-Chemce or Sigma (St. Fouis, Missouri, USA). Others may be prepared by procedures, or obvious modifications thereof, described in standard reference texts such as Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-15 (John Wiley, and Sons, 1991), Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Volumes 1-5, and Supplemental (Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989), Organic Reactions, Volumes 1-40 (John Wiley, and Sons, 1991), March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, (John Wiley, and Sons, 5th Edition, 2001), and Farock's Comprehensive Organic Transformations (VCH Publishers Inc., 1989).

Compounds A-300 and A-400 (wherein R refers to a suitable protecting group such as methyl, ethyl, etc.) are reacted with at least a stoichiometric amount and preferably an excess of a suitable alpha-amino acid (particularly, but not limited to, glycine or alanine or their corresponding salts). The reaction is conducted under conventional coupling conditions well known in the art. In one embodiment, the reaction is conducted in the presence of sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide or another suitable base in methanol, DMF or another suitable solvent under elevated reaction temperatures and particularly at reflux.

Use of Compounds of the Invention [0163] The compounds of the present invention can be used to inhibit HIF hydroxylase activity, thereby modulating the stability and/or activity of HIF and activating HIF-regulated gene expression. The compounds can be used in methods to treat, pretreat, or delay progression or onset of conditions associated with HIF including, but not limited to, anemia and various aspects of ischemic, and hypoxic conditions. In various embodiments, the compound is administered immediately following a condition associated with ischemia, e.g., myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, intestinal infarction, ischemic stroke, renal ischemic-reperfusion injury, cardiac cirrhosis, macular degeneration, pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory failure, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and congestive heart failure. In another embodiment, the compound is administered immediately after a trauma or injury. In other embodiments, the compound can be administered to a subject based on predisposing conditions, e.g., hypertension, diabetes, occlusive arterial disease, chronic venous insufficiency, Raynaud’s disease, chronic skin ulcers, cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, and systemic sclerosis. In still other embodiments, compounds may be administered to pretreat a subject to decrease or prevent the development of tissue damage associated with ischemia or hypoxia. [0164] In particular embodiments, the compounds of the present invention can be used to increase endogenous erythropoietin (ΕΡΟ). The compounds can be administered to prevent, pretreat, or treat EPO-associated conditions, including, e.g., conditions associated with anemia and neurological disorders. Conditions associated with anemia include disorders such as acute or chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cancer, ulcers, infection with virus, e.g., HIV, bacteria, or parasites; inflammation, etc. Anemic conditions can further include those associated with procedures or treatments including, e.g., radiation therapy, chemotherapy, dialysis, and surgery.

Additionally, the compounds can be used to increase endogenous ΕΡΟ levels in an anemic or non-anemic patient scheduled to undergo surgery to reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusions or to facilitate banking of blood prior to surgery. 6. Biological Testing [0166] The biological activity of the compounds of the invention may be assessed using any conventionally known methods. Suitable assay methods are well known in the art. The following assays are presented only as examples and are not intended to be limiting. The compounds of the invention are active in at least one of the following assays. i. Cell-based HIFa stabilization assay [0167] Human cells derived from various tissues are separately seeded into 35 mm culture dishes, and grown at 37 °C, 20 % 02, 5 % C02 in standard culture medium, e.g., DMEM (Dulbecco’s modification of Eagle’s medium), 10 % FBS (fetal bovine serum). When cell layers reach confluence, the media is replaced with OPTI-MEM media (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA), and cell layers are incubated for approximately 24 hours in 20 % 02, 5 % C02 at 37 °C. Compound or 0.013 % DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) is then added to existing medium and incubation is continued overnight. [0168] Following incubation, the media is removed, centrifuged, and stored for analysis (see VEGF and ΕΡΟ assays below). The cells are washed two times in cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in 1 mL of 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 % IGEPAL (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO), and a protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 15 minutes on ice. Cell lysates are centrifuged at 3,000 xg for 5 minutes at 4 °C, and the cytosolic fractions (supernatant) are collected. The nuclei (pellet) are resuspended and lysed in 100 pL of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and a protease mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), centrifuged at 13,000 xg for 5 minutes at 4 °C, and the nuclear protein fractions (supernatant) are collected. [0169] Nuclear fractions are analyzed for HIF-la using a QUANTIKINE immunoassay (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis ΜΝ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ii. Cell-based VEGF and ΕΡΟ ELISA assays [0170] Conditioned media collected from cell cultures as described above is analyzed for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and/or erythropoietin (ΕΡΟ) expression using an appropriate QUANTIKINE immunoassay (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. iii. HIF-PH assay [0171] Ketoglutaric acid a-[l-14C]-sodium salt, alpha-ketoglutaric acid sodium salt, and HPLC purified peptide may be obtained from commercial sources, e.g., Perkin-Elmer (Wellesley ΜΑ), Sigma-Aldrich, and SynPep Corp. (Dublin CA), respectively. Peptides for use in the assay may be fragments of HIFa as described above or as disclosed in International Publication WO 2005/118836, incorporated by reference herein. For example, a HIF peptide for use in the HIF-PH assay is [methoxycoumarin]-DLDLEALAPYIPADDDFQL-amide. HIF-PH, e.g., HIF-PH2 (EGLN1), can be expressed in, e.g., insect Hi5 cells, and partially purified, e.g., through a SP ion exchange chromatography column. Enzyme activity is determined by capturing 14C02 using an assay described by Kivirikko and Myllyla (1982, Methods Enzymol. 82:245-304). Assay reactions contain 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 μΜ a-ketoglutaric acid sodium salt, 0.30 pCi/mE ketoglutaric acid a-[l-14C]-sodium salt, 40 μΜ FeS04, 1 mM ascorbate, 1541.8 units/mL Catalase, with or without 50 μΜ peptide substrate and various concentrations of compound of the invention. Reactions are initiated by addition of HIF-PH enzyme. [0172] The peptide-dependent percent turnover is calculated by subtracting percent turnover in the absence of peptide from percent turnover in the presence of substrate peptide. Percent inhibition and IC50 are calculated using peptide-dependent percent turnover at given inhibitor concentrations. Calculation of IC50 values for each inhibitor is conducted using GraFit software (Erithacus Software Ltd., Surrey UK). [0173] Representative compounds of the invention were analyzed using the HIF-PH assay described above. Table 1 presents enzyme inhibition data for exemplary compounds against HIF-PH2, a representative HIF prolyl hydroxylase. By inhibiting HIF prolyl hydroxylase, compounds of the invention stabilize HIFa, which then combines with HIFB to form an active transcription factor that increases expression of various genes involved in numerous beneficial cellular processes.

Primary routes for parenteral administration include intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous administration. Secondary routes of administration include intraperitoneal, intra-arterial, intra-articular, intracardiac, intracisternal, intradermal, intralesional, intraocular, intrapleural, intrathecal, intrauterine, and intraventricular administration. The indication to be treated, along with the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the drug, dictate the type of formulation and the route of administration to be used, as well as whether local or systemic delivery would be preferred. [0177] Pharmaceutical dosage forms of a compound of the invention may be provided in an instant release, controlled release, sustained release, or target drug-delivery system. Commonly used dosage forms include, for example, solutions and suspensions, (micro-) emulsions, ointments, gels and patches, liposomes, tablets, dragees, soft or hard shell capsules, suppositories, ovules, implants, amorphous or crystalline powders, aerosols, and lyophilized formulations. Depending on route of administration used, special devices may be required for application or administration of the drug, such as, for example, syringes and needles, inhalers, pumps, injection pens, applicators, or special flasks. Pharmaceutical dosage forms are often composed of the drug, an excipient(s), and a container/closure system. One or multiple excipients, also referred to as inactive ingredients, can be added to a compound of the invention to improve or facilitate manufacturing, stability, administration, and safety of the drug, and can provide a means to achieve a desired drug release profile. Therefore, the type of excipient(s) to be added to the drug can depend on various factors, such as, for example, the physical and chemical properties of the drug, the route of administration, and the manufacturing procedure. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are available in the art and include those listed in various pharmacopoeias. (See, e.g., the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP), European Pharmacopoeia (ΕΡ), and British pharmacopeia (BP); the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (www.fda.gov) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CEDR) publications, e.g., Inactive Ingredient Guide (1996); Ash and Ash, Eds. (2002) Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives, Synapse Information Resources, Inc., Endicott NY; etc.) [0178] Pharmaceutical dosage forms of a compound of the present invention may be manufactured by any of the methods well-known in the art, such as, for example, by conventional mixing, sieving, dissolving, melting, granulating, dragee-making, tabletting, suspending, extruding, spray-drying, levigating, emulsifying, (nano/micro-) encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilization processes. As noted above, the compositions of the present invention can include one or more physiologically acceptable inactive ingredients that facilitate processing of active molecules into preparations for pharmaceutical use. [0179] Proper formulation is dependent upon the desired route of administration. For intravenous injection, for example, the composition may be formulated in aqueous solution, if necessary using physiologically compatible buffers, including, for example, phosphate, histidine, or citrate for adjustment of the formulation pH, and a tonicity agent, such as, for example, sodium chloride or dextrose. For transmucosal or nasal administration, semisolid, liquid formulations, or patches may be preferred, possibly containing penetration enhancers. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated in liquid or solid dosage forms, and as instant or controlled/sustained release formulations. Suitable dosage forms for oral ingestion by a subject include tablets, pills, dragees, hard and soft shell capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, and emulsions. The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions, such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. [0180] Solid oral dosage forms can be obtained using excipients, which may include fillers, disintegrants, binders (dry and wet), dissolution retardants, lubricants, glidants, antiadherants, cationic exchange resins, wetting agents, antioxidants, preservatives, coloring, and flavoring agents. These excipients can be of synthetic or natural source. Examples of such excipients include cellulose derivatives, citric acid, dicalcium phosphate, gelatine, magnesium carbonate, magnesium/sodium lauryl sulfate, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, silicates, silicium dioxide, sodium benzoate, sorbitol, starches, stearic acid or a salt thereof, sugars (i.e. dextrose, sucrose, lactose, etc.), talc, tragacanth mucilage, vegetable oils (hydrogenated), and waxes. Ethanol and water may serve as granulation aides. In certain instances, coating of tablets with, for example, a taste-masking film, a stomach acid resistant film, or a release-retarding film is desirable. Natural and synthetic polymers, in combination with colorants, sugars, and organic solvents or water, are often used to coat tablets, resulting in dragees. When a capsule is preferred over a tablet, the drug powder, suspension, or solution thereof can be delivered in a compatible hard or soft shell capsule. [0181] In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention can be administered topically, such as through a skin patch, a semi-solid, or a liquid formulation, for example a gel, a (micro-) emulsion, an ointment, a solution, a (nano/micro)-suspension, or a foam. The penetration of the drug into the skin and underlying tissues can be regulated, for example, using penetration enhancers; the appropriate choice and combination of lipophilic, hydrophilic, and amphiphilic excipients, including water, organic solvents, waxes, oils, synthetic and natural polymers, surfactants, emulsifiers; by pH adjustment; and use of complexing agents. Other techniques, such as iontophoresis, may be used to regulate skin penetration of a compound of the invention. Transdermal or topical administration would be preferred, for example, in situations in which local delivery with minimal systemic exposure is desired. [0182] For administration by inhalation, or administration to the nose, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, or semisolid aerosol from pressurized packs, or a nebuliser, usually with the use of a propellant, e.g., halogenated carbons derived from methane and ethane, carbon dioxide, or any other suitable gas. For topical aerosols, hydrocarbons like butane, isobutene, and pentane are useful. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the appropriate dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, for example, gelatin, for use in an inhaler or insufflator, may be formulated. These typically contain a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. [0183] Compositions formulated for parenteral administration by injection are usually sterile and can be presented in unit dosage forms, e.g., in ampoules, syringes, injection pens, or in multidose containers, the latter usually containing a preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents, such as buffers, tonicity agents, viscosity enhancing agents, surfactants, suspending and dispersing agents, antioxidants, biocompatible polymers, chelating agents, and preservatives. Depending on the injection site, the vehicle may contain water, a synthetic or vegetable oil, and/or organic co-solvents. In certain instances, such as with a lyophilized product or a concentrate, the parenteral formulation would be reconstituted or diluted prior to administration. Depot formulations, providing controlled or sustained release of a compound of the invention, may include injectable suspensions of nano/micro particles or nano/micro or ηοηmicronized crystals. Polymers such as poly (lac tic acid), poly (glycolic acid), or copolymers thereof, can serve as controlled/sustained release matrices, in addition to others well known in the art. Other depot delivery systems may be presented in form of implants and pumps requiring incision. [0184] Suitable carriers for intravenous injection for the compounds of the invention are well-known in the art and include water-based solutions containing a base, such as, for example, sodium hydroxide, to form an ionized compound; sucrose or sodium chloride as a tonicity agent; and a buffer, for example, a buffer that contains phosphate or histidine. Co-solvents, such as, for example, polyethylene glycols, may be added. These water-based systems are effective at dissolving compounds of the invention and produce low toxicity upon systemic administration. The proportions of the components of a solution system may be varied considerably, without destroying solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of the components may be varied. For example, low-toxicity surfactants, such as polysorbates or poloxamers, may be used, as can polyethylene glycol or other co-solvents, biocompatible polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone may be added, and other sugars and polyols may substitute for dextrose. [0185] A therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially using a variety of techniques well-known in the art. Initial doses used in animal studies may be based on effective concentrations established in cell culture assays. Dosage ranges appropriate for human subjects can be determined, for example, using data obtained from animal studies and cell culture assays. [0186] An effective amount or a therapeutically effective amount or dose of an agent, e.g., a compound of the invention, refers to that amount of the agent or compound that results in amelioration of symptoms or a prolongation of survival in a subject. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such molecules can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., by determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50 % of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50 % of the population). The dose ratio of toxic to therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ ED50. Agents that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. [0187] The effective amount or therapeutically effective amount is the amount of the compound or pharmaceutical composition that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. Dosages particularly fall within a range of circulating concentrations that includes the ED50 with little or no toxicity. Dosages may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and/or the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration, dosage, and dosage interval should be chosen according to methods known in the art, in view of the specifics of a subject’s condition. [0188] Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active moiety that are sufficient to achieve the desired effects; i.e., the minimal effective concentration (MEC). The MEC will vary for each compound but can be estimated from, for example, in vitro data and animal experiments. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. In cases of local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be related to plasma concentration. [0189] The amount of compound or composition administered may be dependent on a variety of factors, including the sex, age, and weight of the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. [0190] The present compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device containing one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. Such a pack or device may, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack; or glass and rubber stoppers such as in vials. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration. Compositions comprising a compound of the invention formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier may also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition.
