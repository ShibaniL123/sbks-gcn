FIELD OF THE INVENTION This application relates to processes for the synthesis of mono-, di-and tri-organophosphites. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Organophosphites of the general structure (R1O)P(OR2)(OR3) are used in a number of commercially important applications including their use as antioxidants, stabilizers, anti-wear additives and as ligands for various catalytic processes. Organophosphites are generally produced from PX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) and alcohols. The reaction occurs stepwise by displacement of X of PX3 with OR of alcohol ROH and results in the formation of mono-, di- and tri-organophosphite esters e.g., (R1O)PX2, (R1O)(R2O)PX, and (R1O)P(OR2)(OR3) and acid HX-. The acid can be removed by means of physical separation or by means of acid base reaction using organic or inorganic bases. Several methods for making organophosphites, described in Houben-Weyl, Bd. XXII/2 pages 12-17, G. Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1964, and supplement E1, pages 413-421 Stuttgart, New York 1982, are known for the production of phosphites using readily available PCl3 and the corresponding alcohols. However, the selectivity of the displacement of Cl by the alcohol to give the corresponding phosphorous dichloridite (R1O)P(Cl2) and chloridite (R1O)P(OR2)(Cl), respectively, is generally low. This limits the formation of any specific phosphite of the general structure (R1O)P(OR2)(OR3) to low yields, except when R1, R2 and R3 are the same. Though for some applications this low selectivity is acceptable, for others, selectivity to a specific structure with different R groups is highly desirable. In Houben-Weyl, Bd. XXII/2 pages 12-17, G. Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1964, it is summarized that a large excess of PCl3 is needed to preferably form a dichloridite from aliphatic or aromatic alcohols suppressing the second displacement reaction and distillation of the crude dichloridite is obligatory to separate the excess PCl3. Similarly the formation of chloridite from dichloridite and alcohol shows low selectivity, and extensive purification by distillation is needed. WO 01/32666 describes a high yield process for the synthesis of PCl(O-m-tolyl)2 however, due to low selectivities, a time consuming process consisting of a) distillation to separate from by-products dichloridite PCl2(O-m-tolyl) and triarylphosphite P(O-m-tolyl)3 and b) subsequent recycle of the by-products is needed. From WO96/22968 it is known that higher selectivity for the synthesis of chloridites and dichloridites can be achieved by a stepwise protective group approach, however this reaction sequence requires two additional reaction steps for each RO group introduced adding considerable cost to the overall process. Selectivities to form chloridite and/or dichloridite from PCl3 and ROH are generally higher if organic tertiary amines are used in equimolar amounts. For example US 4,120,917 describes the use of tertiary amines as acid scavengers for the production of alkylphosphorodichloridites. A mixture of amine and alcohol is added to an excess of PCl3 in an organic solvent to produce the corresponding dichloridites in moderate yields. However, a five-fold excess of PCl3 is needed to suppress the formation of chloridite. In addition, subsequent filtration of the ammonium salt is required and PCl3 has to be removed by distillation before a mixed phosphite can be produced. Both filtration and PCl3 distillation are significant cost factors. US 6,069,267 and EP 1234831 disclose that yields for phosphorous dichloridite (R1O)P(Cl2) and chloridite (R1O)P(OR2)(Cl) derived from aromatic alcohols, PCl3, and trialkylamines are satisfactory only if temperatures below 0°C between 0°C and -20°C are deployed. Low temperature and viscosity of the product mixture within this temperature range add significantly to operating cost and process complexity. Furthermore, US 6,069,267 describes a process for the selective synthesis of organodiphosphite compounds using PCl3 and aryl alcohols. However, the procedure only gives acceptable yields with phenols containing bulky ortho-substituents as alcohols and does not provide high yields for a general range of mixed triarylphosphites within a commercially favorable temperature range. Gerrard, W. et al., J. Chem. Soc 1955, pp 277-278 discloses the synthesis of bromidites by addition of a single solution of alcohol and pyridine to a dibromidite. A selective commercial production of organophosphites of the general formula (R1O)P(OR2)(OR3) requires a method by which the displacement of X by the alcohol inPX3 and in ROPX2 occurs with high selectivity under commercially feasible conditions. It would be desirable to have high yield, highly selective processes for the production of (R1O)PX2, (R1O)(R2O)PX and (R1O)P(OR2)(OR3) that are not restricted to low temperatures and at a cost that is commercially feasible. The invention described herein is such a process. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In this invention, it has been discovered that the selectivity in the displacement reaction of X in PX3 by the OR1 group of an alcohol R1OH and in the displacement reaction of X in (R1O)PX2 by the OR2 group of an alcohol R2OH in the presence of a triorganoamine (R')(R")(R"')N resulting in the formation of, respectively, the mono-, and diorganophosphite esters e.g., (R1O)PX2 and (R1O)(R2O)PX strongly depends on the method of the addition of the triorganoamine and the respective alcohol. The compound (R1O)PX2 can be made with increased selectivity by the reaction of PX3, alcohol R1OH and a triorganoamine (R')(R")(R"')N, and the compound (R1O)(R2O)PX can be made with increased selectivity by the reaction of (R1O)PX2 , an alcohol R2OH and a triorganoamine (R')(R")(R"')N if the triorganoamine and the respective alcohol are added (i) to PX3 for making (R1O)PX2 and (ii) to (R1O)PX2 for making (R1O)(R2O)PX, such that the additions of the triorganoamine and the alcohol R1OH to PX3 for making (R1O)PX2 or the additions of the triorganoamine and the alcohol R2OH to (R1O)PX2 for making (R1O)(R2O)PX are done in a separate but concurrent fashion or in a separate and in alternating portions of the triorganoamine and the respective alcohol. The method of addition to the reaction mixture allows the triorganoamine and the respective alcohol to be present in low concentrations and in a low molar ratios relative to PX3 and (R1O)PX2 for making (R1O)PX2 and (R1O)PX2 and (R1O)(R2O)PX for making (R1O)(R2O)PX during the largest part of the addition period without using excessive PX3 for making (R1O)PX2, (R1O)PX2 for making (R1O)(R2O)PX or excessive solvent for alcohol and triorganoamine. The method of this invention allows a wider range of reaction temperatures including significantly higher reaction temperatures as well as higher yields as previously reported in the art. Disclosed herein is, therefore: a method for making a composition comprising a compound of the formula (R1O)PX2, wherein X is selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br, and I, R1 is a C1 to C18 alkyl, a C6 to C18 aryl radical, or a C3 to C18 cycloalkyl radical, wherein said method comprises: contacting a first solution comprising a predetermined amount of PX3 dissolved in an aprotic solvent with (i) a second solution comprising a predetermined amount of an alcohol R1OH, and a predetermined amount of a triorganoamine (R')(R")(R"')N, wherein R', R" and R"' are independently selected from the group consisting of C1 to C18 alkyl, C6 to C18 aryl and C4 to C18 heteroaryl radicals, and wherein the molar ratio of the alcohol to the triorganoamine is greater than 5, and (ii) a third solution comprising a predetermined amount of the triorganoamine and a predetermined amount of the alcohol, wherein the molar ratio of the triorganoamine to the alcohol is greater than 5, and wherein in said method the second and third solutions are added to the first solution separately by either (a) adding each of the second and third solutions concurrently and continuously into the first solution at a rate of no greater than 4 molar equivalents of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine, relative to the PX3, per hour until the predetermined amounts of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine have been added to the first solution, provided that at any given time, the total molar amount of alcohol added does not exceed the total molar amount of trioganoamine added by more than 25% of the total molar amount of the triorganoamine added; or(b) adding each of the second and third solutions concurrently and discontinuously into the first solution at a rate of no greater than 4 molar equivalents of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine, relative to the PX3, per hour in aliquots of the second solution containing no more than 0.5 molar equivalents of alcohol and in aliquots of the third solution containing no more than 0.5 equivalents of triorganoamine, until the predetermined amounts of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine have been added to the first solution; or(c) adding each of the second and third solutions discontinuously into the first solution at a rate of no greater than 4 molar equivalents of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine, relative to the PX3, per hour in aliquots of the second solution containing no more than 0.5 molar equivalents of alcohol and in aliquots of the third solution containing no more than 0.5 equivalents of triorganoamine, until the predetermined amounts of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine have been added to the first solution by repetitively adding an aliquot of either the triorganoamine followed sequentially by an aliquot of the alcohol, or an aliquot of the alcohol followed by an aliquot of the triorganoamine, until the predetermined amounts of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine have been added to the first solution; to produce the composition comprising the compound of the formula R1OPX2, provided that in either of the alternatives (b) or (c), for any given additions, whether concurrent or sequential, within a series of discontinuous additions, the molar difference between the triorganoamine added and the alcohol added does not exceed 0.5 equivalent, relative to the PX3. The present invention provides a method of producing (R1O) (R2O) PX by the reaction of (R1O) PX2, alcohol R2OH and a triorganoamine (R')(R")(R"')N such that the additions of the triorganoamine and the alcohol R2OH are done in a separate but concurrent fashion or in a separate and in alternating portions of the triorganoamine and the respective alcohol, wherein X is selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br and I, R1 and R2 are independently selected from the group consisting of C1-18 alkyl, C6-18 aryl and C3-C18 cycloalkyl radicals; and R'R"R"' are independently selected from the group consisting of C1 to C18 alkyl, C6 to C18 aryl and C4 to C18 heteroaryl radicals.

The present invention also provides a method for making a composition comprising a compound of the formula (R1O)(R2O)PX, wherein X is selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br, and I, R1 and R2are independently selected from the group consisting of C1 to C18 alkyl, C6 to C18 aryl, and C3 to C18 cycloalkyl radicals, wherein said method comprises: contacting a first solution comprising a predetermined amount of R1OPX2 dissolved in an aprotic solvent with (i) a second solution comprising a predetermined amount of an alcohol R2OH, and a predetermined amount of a triorganoamine (R')(R")(R"')N, wherein R', R" and R"' are independently selected from the group consisting of C1 to C18 alkyl, C6 to C18 aryl and 64 to C18 heteroaryl radical, and wherein the molar ratio of the alcohol to the triorganoamine is greater than 5, and (ii) a third solution comprising a predetermined amount of the triorganoamine and a predetermined amount of the alcohol, wherein the molar ratio of the triorganoamine to the alcohol is greater than 5, and wherein in said method the second and third solutions are added to the first solution separately by either (a) adding each of the second and third solutions concurrently and continuously into the first solution at a rate of no greater than 4 molar equivalents of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine relative to the (R1O)PX2, per hour until the predetermined amounts of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine have been added to the first solution, provided that at any given time, the total molar amount of alcohol added does not exceed the total molar amount of trioganoamine added by more than 25% of the total molar amount of the triorganoamine added; or(b) adding each of the second and third solutions concurrently and discontinuously into the first solution at a rate of no greater than 4 molar equivalents of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine, relative to the (R1O)PX2, per hour in aliquots of the second solution containing no more than 0.5 molar equivalents of alcohol and in aliquots of the third solution containing no more than 0.5 equivalents of triorganoamine, until the predetermined amounts of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine have been added to the first solution; or(c) adding each of the second and third solutions discontinuously into the first solution at a rate of no greater than 4 molar equivalents of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine, relative to the (R1O)PX2, per hour in aliquots of the second solution containing no more than 0.5 molar equivalents of alcohol and in aliquots of the third solution containing no more than 0.5 equivalents of triorganoamine, until the predetermined amounts of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine have been added to the first solution by repetitively adding an aliquot of either the triorganoamine followed sequentially by an aliquot of the alcohol, or an aliquot of the alcohol followed by an aliquot of the triorganoamine, until the predetermined amounts of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine have been added to the first solution; to produce the composition comprising the compound of the formula (R1O)(R2O)PX, provided that in either of the alternatives (b) or (c), for any given additions, whether concurrent or sequential, within a series of discontinuous additions, the molar difference between the triorganoamine added and the alcohol added does not exceed 0.5 equivalent, relative to the R1OPX2. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention describes methods for the synthesis of the compound (R1O)(R2O)PX, wherein X is selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br and I, and wherein R1, R2 and R3 can be independently selected from the group consisting of C1 to C18 alkyl, C6 to C18 aryl, and C3 to C18 cycloalkyl radicals. Also disclosed are methods for the synthesis of compounds of formula (R1O)PX2,(R1O)(R2O)2P and (R1O)P(OR2)(OR3). For the synthesis of the compound (R1O)PX2, a first solution comprising a predetermined amount of PX3 dissolved in an aprotic solvent is contacted with (i) a second solution comprising a predetermined amount of an alcohol R1OH, and a predetermined amount of a triorganoamine (R')(R")(R"')N, wherein R', R" and R"' are independently selected from the group consisting of C1 to C18 alkyl, C6 to C18 aryl and C4 to C18 heteroaryl radicals, and wherein the molar ratio of the alcohol to the triorganoamine is greater than 5, and (ii) a third solution comprising a predetermined amount of the triorganoamine and a predetermined amount of the alcohol, wherein the molar ratio of the triorganoamine to the alcohol is greater than 5, to produce the composition comprising the compound of the formula (R1O)PX2. For the synthesis of the compound (R1O)(R2O)PX, a first solution comprising a predetermined amount of R1OPX2 dissolved in an aprotic solvent is contacted with (i) a second solution comprising a predetermined amount of an alcohol R2OH, and a predetermined amount of a triorganoamine (R)(R")(R"')N, wherein R', R" and R"' are independently selected from the group consisting of C1 to C18 alkyl, C6 to C18 aryl and C4 to C18 heteroaryl radical, and wherein the molar ratio of the alcohol to the triorganoamine is greater than 5, and (ii) a third solution comprising a predetermined amount of the triorganoamine and a predetermined amount of the alcohol, wherein the molar ratio of the triorganoamine to the alcohol is greater than 5, to produce the composition comprising the compound of the formula (R1O)(R2O)PX. The second and third solutions can be added into the first solution separately but concurrently and continuously at a rate of no greater than 4 molar equivalents of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine, relative to the PX3 for making (R1O)PX2, or relative to (R1O)PX2 for making (R1O)(R2O)PX, per hour until the predetermined amounts of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine have been added to the first solution, provided that at any given time, the total molar amount of alcohol added does not exceed the total molar amount of trioganoamine added by more than 25% of the total molar amount of the triorganoamine added. The second and third solutions can be added into the first solution separately and concurrently but discontinuously at a rate of no greater than 4 molar equivalents of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine, relative to the PX3 for making (R1O)PX2, or relative to (R1O)PX2 for making (R1O)(R2O)PX, per hour in aliquots of the second solution containing no more than 0.5 molar equivalents of alcohol and in aliquots of the third solution containing no more than 0.5 equivalents of triorganoamine, until the predetermined amounts of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine have been added to the first solution. The second and third solutions can be added into the first solution separately and discontinuously at a rate of no greater than 4 molar equivalents of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine, relative to the PX3 for making (R1O)PX2, or relative to (R1O)PX2 for making (R1O)(R2O)PX, per hour in aliquots of the second solution containing no more than 0.5 molar equivalents of alcohol and in aliquots of the third solution containing no more than 0.5 equivalents of triorganoamine, until the predetermined amounts of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine have been added to the first solution by repetitively adding an aliquot of either the triorganoamine followed sequentially by an aliquot of the alcohol, or an aliquot of the alcohol followed by an aliquot of the triorganoamine, until the predetermined amounts of each of the alcohol and triorganoamine have been added to the first solution; In either of the alternatives above for discontinuous additions, for any given additions, whether concurrent or sequential, within a series of discontinuous additions, the molar difference between the triorganoamine added and the alcohol added does not exceed 0.5 equivalent, relative to the PX3 for making (R1O)PX2, or relative to (R1O)PX2 for making (R1O)(R2O)PX. The composition comprising the compound of the formula (R1O)PX2 made by the method described above can be used as the first solution for making (R1O)PX2. One can use the product of reaction of PX3 with an alcohol R1OH and any triorganoamine by a method different from that described above. For example, (R1O)PX2 prepared by less selective methods described in the prior art and dissolved in an aprotic solvent can also be used. The above methods can be used for successive replacement of X of PX3 by a polyalcohol to produce products of the general formula A(OPX2)n, B[(R1O)(X)PO]n, etc., where A and B can be independently selected from the group consisting of C2 to C18 alkyl, C3 to C18 cycloalkyl, and C6 to C18 aryl di-, tri- or tetra-radicals corresponding to n=2, n=3 and n=4. It is critical to add the triorganoamine and the alcohol separately in such a way that both materials exhibit low concentration in the reaction mixture where the formation of the products occurs. Furthermore it is important that the triorganoamine and the alcohol concentration relative to PX3 and (R1O)PX2 for making (R1O)PX2 and (R1O)PX2 and (R1O)(R2O)PX for making (R1O)(R2O)PX are low during the largest part of the addition period. This can be achieved in the above described ways, for example by either separate and concurrent both continuous and discontinuous addition of triorganoamine and alcohol or by separate and discontinuous repetitive additions of small aliquot portions one followed by the other of the triorganoamine and the alcohol. The separate and concurrent, both continuous and discontinuous additions can be achieved by using one or more separate feed lines for each the triorganoamine and the alcohol attached either directly to the reaction vessel at different locations, or to an external recirculation pipe. In a preferred mode of the separate and discontinuous repetitive additions of aliquot portions one followed by the other of the triorganoamine and the alcohol, the addition begins with the addition of an aliquot portion of the triorganoamine. In a more preferred version of this addition mode at least two alternating additions are employed. Most preferred is the separate but concurrent addition mode. The preferred amount of each alcohol OH group added per equivalent X attached to P is important for the product distribution and depends on the individual selectivity of the substrates in the displacement reaction and the target distribution of the corresponding phosphite. Generally 0.8 to 1.2 molar equivalents of alcohol OH groups per molar equivalent of phosphorous bound X groups are suitable. More preferred but not restrictive are 1.00 to 1.05 mol equivalents of alcohol OH groups per phosphorous bound X groups to be substituted. The ratio between added triorganoamine and alcohol at any given time of the process is important for the selectivity of the displacement reaction of X by R1O or by R2O. For polyalcohols each alcohol OH group represents a molar equivalent of OH in the displacement reaction of X. It is preferred to keep the difference in the amount of added molar equivalents of triorganoamine and molar equivalents of alcohol OH groups at any given time of the addition between 0.0 and 1.0 equivalents. In a more preferred version of this method the difference in the amount of added molar equivalents of triorganoamine and molar equivalents of alcohol OH groups at any given time of the addition is kept between 0.0 and 0.05 equivalents. Furthermore it is preferred to keep conditions where the amount of added molar equivalents of triorganoamine exceeds the amount of added molar equivalents of alcohol OH groups at any given time of the addition by 0.0-0.05 equivalents. In a most preferred version of this invention triorganoamine and alcohol are added in a separate but concurrent fashion in equimolar amounts such that the amount of molar equivalents of added alcohol OH groups does not exceed the molar equivalent amount of added triorganoamine at any given time. The composition comprising the compound of the formula (R1O)(R2O)PX, made by the methods described above, can be contacted with additional amount of the alcohol R2OH and a triorganoamine to produce a product comprising the compound of the formula (R1O)(R2O)2P. The composition comprising the compound of the formula (R1O)(R2O)PX, made by the methods described above, can be contacted with an alcohol R3OH and a triorganoamine to produce a product comprising the compound of the formula (R1O)P(OR2)(OR3). During the addition of the alcohol and the triorganoamine, good agitation using methods known by those skilled in the art is important to provide sufficient heat removal and to avoid areas of highly concentrated triorganoamine or alcohol. This invention is especially useful for the production of mixed compounds, e.g., compounds (R1O)(R2O)2P and (R1O)P(OR2)(OR3). At any given time of the concurrent alcohol and triorganoamine addition, the alcohol feed may be changed to a different alcohol. Mixed phosphites, (R1O)(R2O)PX can be synthesized in high selectivity by first adding approximately one equivalent of alcohol R1OH and triorganoamine, separately and concurrently, followed by approximately one equivalent of alcohol R2OH and triorganoamine. The triorganoamine, (R)(R")(R"')N used in the methods of this invention should be as dry as possible to minimize hydrolysis of phosphorus reactants and products and are independently selected from the group consisting of aliphatic, aromatic and hetero aromatic amines, or combinations thereof. The triorganoamine used may be substituted or unsubstituted. It is preferred, however, that the corresponding triorganoammonium salt exhibits no acidic reactivity in the reaction medium to avoid undesired rearrangement reactions of the phosphite products. Preferred amines are amines selected from the group consisting trialkylamines wherein the alkyl groups are linear, branched or cyclic, have 1 to 12 carbon atoms and may be linked together. More preferred amines are chosen from the group of trimethylamine, dimethylethylamine, diethylmethylamine, triethylamine, dimethylpropylamine and dimethylisopropylamine. Aprotic solvents are suitable provided they do not react with PX3, triorganoamine, alcohol and triorgano-ammonium salts. The solvent should not have the ability to dissolve the triorganoammonium salt produced during the reaction if the acidity associated with dissociated triorganoammonium salts can cause undesired rearrangement reactions. Furthermore, a solvent with a melting point below the desired reaction temperature is preferred. Preferred solvents are selected from the group of organic aprotic solvents or mixtures thereof. More preferred are solvents or solvent mixtures selected from the group of aliphatic and aromatic solvents. Most preferred solvents or solvent mixtures are aromatic solvents selected from the group consisting of toluene, xylenes, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphtaline, and ethylbenzene. The rates of addition of triorganoamine and alcohol are generally limited by the mixing and cooling capabilities of the equipment. Practical addition times range from 15 minutes to 12 hours. A preferred range is 1 to 6 hours. Reagent and product concentrations are generally limited by the ability to effectively mix the resulting slurry of triorganoamine-HX. The concentrations of the phosphorous species, the triorganoamine, and the alcohol can be independently chosen only limited by density and solubility as long as the above and below mentioned process conditions described herein are maintained. The alcohols and the amines may be fed neat or diluted with solvent. The alcohol feed may contain triorganoamine and the triorganoamine feed may contain alcohol, however, for the alcohol feed the molar ratio of alcohol to the triorganoamine should be greater than 5, preferably greater than 9, and, for the triorganoamine feed the molar ratio of the triorganoamine to the alcohol should be greater than 5, preferably greater than 9. It is most preferred that the feed containing alcohol contains no triorganoamine and the feed containing triorganoamine contains no alcohol. A preferred concentration range for the triorganoamine and alcohol feed is 1 to 4 mol/l in feed solutions. The final concentration of phosphorus-containing product in the reactor may range from about 1% to 35%. The preferred concentration of the phosphorous containing product in the reactor ranges from 7% to 25% by weight. In the process of this invention, water in the solvent, triorganoamine, alcohol, and reaction vessel can decrease yields to the desired monophosphite, diphosphite, and triphosphite products. Hence, it is necessary to reduce the water content in the solvent, reagents, and vessel to concentrations that generate acceptable yields on an economic basis and conduct the reaction under an inert atmosphere. Suitable PX3 compounds are those where X is capable of exchange reactions with alcohols in the presence of a triorganoamine to form a P-O bond and a salt of HX-triorganoamine. Preferred groups for X are Cl, Br, I. Most preferred is Cl. In principle, all alcohols capable of reacting with PX3 in the presence of a base are suitable substrates for the present invention. Aromatic as well as aliphatic alcohols show significantly higher selectivities in the displacement reaction with PX3 and (R1O)PX2 if the above mentioned process is applied. Non-exclusive examples for suitable alcohols are primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic alcohols including diols and polyols. Further nonexclusive examples include aromatic alcohols, diols and polyols from the group of substituted and unsubstituted phenols, naphthols, hydroxyphenanthrenes and hydroxyanthracenes, hydroxy-substituted heteroaromatic compounds. The preferred reaction temperature for a given displacement of X in PX3 depends on the steric and electronic nature of the alcohol and the decomposition temperature of the corresponding products. However, this invention is not restricted to the low temperature range as previously described in the prior art. Aromatic alcohols give good selectivity to the corresponding phosphorodichloridites and chloridites over a wide range of temperatures even at 55°C. In most cases, sterically demanding alcohols such as ortho-substituted phenols give better yields to the corresponding dichloridites and chloridites compared to less-hindered alcohols such as unsubstituted or meta- and para-substituted aromatic alcohols lacking ortho-substitution. If the reactivity of the alcohol is low, a reaction temperature high enough to provide a reaction rate equal to or faster than the addition rate is preferred. Since under commercial operation the temperature range achievable is subject to limits of the equipment available, temperatures above -25°C are generally preferred. A preferred but not limiting temperature range for this process is -25°C to +65°C. The reaction is relatively insensitive to pressure and is limited only by practical considerations. For practical reasons, preferred reaction pressure ranges from 10 psia (69 kPa) to 50 psia (345 kPa). Compounds (R1O)PX2 and (R1O)(R2O)PX formed by the processes described above can be transformed conveniently in the same or a separate vessel to the corresponding phosphites (R1O)P(OR2)(OR3) and (R1O)(R2O)2P, respectively, thiophosphites (R1O)P(OR2)(SR4), (R1O)P(SR4)(SR5), or amidites (R1O)P(OR2)(NR6R7), (R1O)P(NR6R7)(NR8R9) by displacing the remaining X's of (R1O)PX2 or (R1O)(R2O)PX with one or more of the groups OR2, OR3, SR4, SR5, NR6R7, and NR8R9 groups wherein R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8 and R9 can be independently selected from the group consisting of C1 to C18 alkyl, C6 to C18 aryl, and C3 to C18 cycloalkyl radicals. Compound (R1O)(R2O)PX can be hydrolyzed to (R1O)(R2O)POH. For (R1O)P(OR2)(OR3), this reaction product can be obtained by adding about one molar equivalent of triorganoamine followed by one equivalent of alcohol R3OH to (R1O)PX2. For (R1O)P(OR2)2, this reaction product can be obtained by adding about two molar equivalents of triorganoamine followed by two equivalents alcohol HOR2 to (R1O)(R2O)PX. In contrast to the formation of (R1O)PX2 and (R1O)(R2O)PX, for transformation to (R1O)P(OR2)(OR3) and derivatives described above, the alcohols and amines may be fed as a mixture, if so desired. Likewise, thiophosphites e.g., (R1O)P(OR2)(SR4), (R1O)P(SR4)(SR5), and amidites e.g., (R1O)P(OR2)(NR6R7), (R1O)P(NR6R7)(NR8R9) can be produced from (R1O)PX2 or (R1O)(R2O)PX and secondary amines and thiols, respectively. The process described herein can be carried out as a continuous process whereby the triorganoamine and the alcohol are added concurrently but separately into a continuous type reactor, such as a continuous flow stirred tank reactor (CSTR). Simultaneously, PX3 is added separately or together with the triorganoamine, and the triorganoamine and the alcohol are fed separately and concurrently. This embodiment of the present invention has the advantage of smaller reaction volumes with improved mixing and heat transfer. In a more preferred variation of a continuous process a series of 2 to 10 CSTR's are used whereby the PX3 is fed into the first reactor only and the triorganoamine and the alcohol are fed separately and concurrently in portions into each subsequent reactor. In the most preferred version of a continuous reactor a plug-flow reactor is employed where PX3 is fed into an entry port at the beginning of the plug-flow reactor and the triorganoamine and the alcohol are added concurrently but separately in equimolar portions into multiple entry ports along the length of the plug-flow reactor.
