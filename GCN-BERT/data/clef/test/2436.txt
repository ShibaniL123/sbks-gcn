(4) Preparation of 6-methyl-8-nitrochromane
Under the protection of N2, in a 500mLthree-necked bottle, THF(500 mL) and 2-(3-hydroxypropyl)-4-methyl-6-nitrophenol (16.7g, 0.079mol) were added separately. After cooling to 0°C, triphenylphosphine(29.3g, 0.111mol) was added in batch. After the addition, DEAD (19.3g, 0.111mol) was added dropwise. After the addition, the resultant mixture was warmed to room temperature naturally and reacted for 24 h. GC-MC detection showed complete reaction. 100mL water was added, and the organic phase was separated. The water phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (50mL×3). The organic phases were combined, washed with saturated NaCl aqueous solution (100mL×1), and dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. After column chromatography (EA:PE=1:50),the product (8.3g, yield: 54%) was obtained.
