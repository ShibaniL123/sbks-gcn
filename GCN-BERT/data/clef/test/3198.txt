No. 8,672,002 which is a continuation of U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 11/977,891, filed Oct. 26, 2007 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,537,032, which is a continuation of U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 10/919,494, filed on Aug. 17, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,308,922. FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure relates to key locators. More particularly, this disclosure pertains to key locators that are especially adapted to facilitate the ready location of keys in a purse, backpack, briefcase or like bag. BACKGROUND A common and popular type of purse or like bag has a top that includes at least a region that is upwardly open in use. Often this type of bag is rather deep, permitting the owner-user to store a variety of items. Further, such depth is generally considered fashionable. A known drawback of the above-described purse or like bag configuration resides in the difficulty of readily retrieving keys, or a group thereof gathered on a key chain, from its interior. This can lead to the frustration of the owner-user and to others. For example, the difficulty of locating car keys at the bottom of a purse can cause significant delay in vacating a parking space. Given the above importance of the above identified objectives, what are needed in the art are improved apparatus for holding and storing keys and similar items when transporting them in purses or other bags. SUMMARY The present disclosure addresses the preceding and other shortcomings of the prior art by providing a key locator. Such a key locator includes a first member having opposed end portions. The member incorporates a bent interior region intermediate the end portions. A second member includes a clasp for selectively retaining at least one key. The first and second members are engaged to one another. The preceding and other features of the invention will become further apparent from the detailed description that follows. Such description is accompanied by a set of drawing figures. Numerals of the drawing figures correspond to numerals of the written description with like numerals referring to like features throughout both the written description and the drawing figures.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION First Embodiment Turning now to the drawings, FIG. 1A is a front elevation view of the key locator 10 of the invention. The key locator 10 comprises interlocking first and second members 12 and 14 respectively. In some embodiments the first member 12 and the second members 14 are each independently made of steel, or other metal, a plastic, or other rigid elastomeric material. In some embodiments, the first member 12 and the second member 14 each independently comprise gold, silver, steel, nickel, aluminum, an alloy thereof, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the first member 12 and the second member 14 are each made of metal. In some embodiments, the first member 12 and/or the second member 14 comprises urethane polymer, an acrylic polymer, a fluoropolymer, polybenzamidazole, polyimide, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyetheretherketone, polyamide-imide, glass-based phenolic, polystyrene, cross-linked polystyrene, polyester, polycarbonate, polyethylene, polyethylene, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, polytetrafluoro-ethylene, polymethacrylate, nylon 6,6, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate, rigid vinyl, plasticized vinyl, or polypropylene. In some embodiments, all or a portion of the bent-rod shaped first member 12 is electroplated. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1A, the second member 14 includes a clasp 16 that, in some embodiments, is rotatably engaged to an inverted u-shaped element 18. It will be appreciated that clasp 16 is an exemplary way to retain keys. For example, in some alternative embodiments, rather than a clasp 16, a key ring is used in the place of clasp 16. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1A, the u-shaped element 18 is arranged to engage a hook 20 at a first end portion of the first member 12 in order to provide flexible engagement of the members 12 and 14. One of skill in the art will appreciate that there are numerous other methods by which members 12 and 14 can be flexibly engaged. For example, there can be a ring (not shown in FIG. 1) at the first end portion of the first member 12 that engages both hook 20 and u-shaped element 18. In another example, there can be a set of interlocking rings where a first ring in the set of interlocking rings engages hook 20 whereas a second ring in the set of interlocking rings engages u-shaped element 18. The first and second ring may interlock or there may be any number of interlocking rings between the first and second ring. In still another example, there can be a closed form element (not shown) that engages both hook 20 and u-shaped element 18. The closed form element may indeed be the shape of a ring or some other symmetrical shape such as an oval but the disclosure is not so limited. Any closed form shape, such as a polygon, star-shape, or the like can be used to interlock hook 20 to u-shaped element 18. In still another example, there can be a set of interlocking closed form elements where a first closed form element in the set of interlocking closed form elements engages hook 20 whereas a second closed form element in the set of interlocking closed form elements engages u-shaped element 18. The first and second closed form elements may interlock or there may be any number of interlocking closed form elements between the first and second closed form element. In some embodiments, a chain is used to interlock u-shaped element 18 to hook 20. It will be appreciated that hook 20 is just one example of a way to flexibly engage members 12 and 14. For example, hook 20 can be completely closed off so that it is, in of itself, in fact a closed form shape such as a ring or oval. Similarly, it will be appreciated that u-shaped element 18 is just one example of a way to flexibly engage members 12 and 14. For example, rather than having a u-shaped element 18, a pivoting element can be used to flexibly engage members 12 and 14. In one aspect, referring to FIG. 1C, a first end portion 12a of the first member 12 comprises a hook 20 for substantially permanently and flexibly engaging with the second member 14. The second member 14 comprises a closed form clasp 16 or ring (not shown) that is configured for selectively retaining at least one key or other type of object. In one such embodiment, the closed form clasp 16 or ring is rotatably fixed to a u-shaped element 18 of the second member 14, where the u-shaped element 18 is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the hook 20. In another such embodiment (not illustrated), the closed form clasp 16 or ring is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the hook 20. In another such embodiment, the closed form clasp 16 or ring is engaged with a closed form member, where the closed form member is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the hook. This closed form member could be, for example, a ring, an oval, a start shape, or any other closed form shape. In another such embodiment (not shown), the closed form clasp 16 or ring is engaged with a closed form member, where the closed form member is a ring that is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the hook 20. In still another such embodiment (not shown), the closed form clasp 16 or second ring is engaged with a chain, where the chain is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the hook. In yet another such embodiment (not shown), the closed form clasp 16 or second ring is engaged with first interlocking closed form elements in a plurality of interlocking closed form elements, where an interlocking closed form element in the plurality of interlocking closed form elements is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the hook. In some such embodiments, a closed form element in the plurality of closed form elements is a ring, an oval, a polygon, or a star-shape. Referring to FIG. 7, in some embodiments the first end portion 12a of the bent rod-shaped first member 12 comprises a hook 20 for substantially permanently and flexibly engaging with the second member 14. The second member of the key locator 10 further comprises a first ring 702 that is hooked onto the hook 20. The second member of the key locator 10 further comprises a member 704 having a first portion and a second portion. The first portion is rotatable with respect to the second portion. The first portion comprises a first eyelet through which the first ring 702 is attached. The second portion comprises a second eyelet. The second member 14 of the key locator 10 further comprises a second ring 706 that is attached to the second eyelet. Similar to FIG. 7, although not depicted, in some embodiments, the first end portion 12a of the bent rod-shaped first member 12 comprises a first ring for substantially permanently and flexibly engaging with the second member 14. The second member 14 of the key locator 10 further comprises a second ring that is hooked onto the first ring.

The first portion comprises a first eyelet through which the second ring is attached. The second portion comprises a second eyelet. The second member 14 of the key locator 10 further comprises a third ring, where the third ring is attached to the second eyelet. In another aspect, a first end portion 12a of the first member 12 comprises a first ring (not shown) for substantially permanently and flexibly engaging with the second member 14. The second member 14 comprises a closed form clasp 16 or second ring (not shown) that is configured for selectively retaining at least one key or other type of object. In one such embodiment, the closed form clasp 16 or second ring is rotatably fixed to a u-shaped element 18 of the second member 14, where the u-shaped element 18 is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the first ring. In another such embodiment, the closed form clasp 16 or second ring is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the first ring. In another such embodiment, the closed form clasp 16 or second ring is engaged with a closed form member, where the closed form member is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the first ring. In still another such embodiment, the closed form clasp 16 or second ring is engaged with a closed form member, where the closed form member is a third ring that is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the first ring.

The ornament 26, comprising a flower-like shape as shown in the drawings but not limited thereto, is arranged to face away from the interior of the first member 12 with its back portion 28 preferably fixed to the enlarged region 24 of the member by solder or the like. In some embodiments that do not have an enlarged region 24, the back portion 28 is affixed directly onto the end portion of the first member. As used herein, an ornament is a solid object as opposed to a chain or a rope. In some embodiments, the ornament comprises an artificial or a real gem. FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the key locator 10 of the invention in use. In FIG. 2, the key locator 10 is hung from the upper edge 29 of a side panel 30 of a bag-like purse 32 with the bent interior region 22 overhanging the side panel 30 so that the face of the ornament 26 is exposed. In other embodiments (not shown), the key locator 10 clasps the upper edge 29 of a side panel 30 of a bag-like purse 32 with the bent interior region 22 overhanging the side panel 30 so that the face of the ornament 26 is exposed. The foregoing provides the user with an attractive adjunct to the bag-like purse 32 that serves the additional function of readily locating the key locator 10. FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of the key locator 10 of the disclosure in use taken at line 3-3 of FIG. 2. Keys or other objects 34, secured by the clasp 16 of the second member 14, are seen to lie near or at the bottom 36 of the bag-like purse 32, somewhat suspended from the upper edge 29 of the side panel 30. The bent interior region 22 of the first member 12 of the key locator 10, as mentioned with reference to the preceding figure, is draped, hung over or clasped to the upper edge 29 to create the suspension effect. The altitude of the bottom of the key locator 10 and keys 34 will depend upon the length of the key locator 10 relative to the depth of the side panel 30 of the bag-like purse 32. However, regardless of the precise altitude of the keys 34 within the bag-like purse 32, they may be readily located due to the visible presence of the ornament 26. In FIG. 1, first member 12 has a rod-like appearance. That is, first member 12 is slender so that it can be easily gripped and removed from a bag-like container such as a purse. There is no requirement that first member 12 have the cylindrical shape depicted in FIG. 1. Any slender shape form that enables the easy removal of key locator 10 from a bag-like purse is within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, first member 12 can be a flattened wire or other flat elements. In another example, in some embodiments, first member 12 has a flat rod-like shape characterized by a cross-section having first and second orthogonal dimensions in which the first dimension defines the thickness of the first member 12 and is between 0.01 cm and 0.5 cm and the second dimension defines the width of the first member 12 and is between 0.1 cm and 2 cm. In another example, in some embodiments, first member 12 has a flat rod-like shape characterized by a cross-section having first and second orthogonal dimensions in which the first dimension defines the thickness of the first member 12 and is between 0.05 cm and 0.8 cm and the second dimension defines the width of the first member 12 and is between 0.2 cm and 3 cm. In some embodiments, the bent interior region 22 is u-shaped. In some embodiments, the bent rod-shaped first member 12 is characterized by a cross-sectional bounding shape that is circular. In some embodiments, the bent rod-shaped first member 12 is characterized by a cross-sectional bounding shape that is ovoid. In some embodiments, the bent rod-shaped first member 12 is characterized by a cross-sectional bounding shape having one or more smooth curved surfaces or a splice of one or more smooth curved surfaces. In some embodiments, the bent rod-shaped first member 12 is characterized by a cross-sectional bounding shape having an arcuate edge. In some embodiments, the bent rod-shaped first member 12 is characterized by different cross-sectional bounding shapes at different portions of the first member 12. Although the figures illustrate the first member in which end portions are parallel to each other and are straight, the present disclosure is not so restricted. The first and second end portions 12a and 12b of the first member 12 may bend toward or away from each other. Moreover, the first and second end portions of the first member 12 may internally include any number of bends. Moreover, the first and second end portions of the first member 12 may be magnetized and the bent-shaped region may contain a hinge. Second Embodiment FIG. 4 is a front perspective view of a key locator 110 in accordance with another embodiment of the disclosure in which, rather than having an ornament 26, there is a container 40. As in the case of the key locator 10 discussed above and illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 3, the key locator 110 illustrated in FIGS. 4 through 6 comprises interlocking first and second members 12 and 14. In some embodiments the first member 12 and the second members 14 are each independently made of steel, or other metal, a plastic, or other rigid elastomeric material. In some embodiments, the first member 12 and the second member 14 each independently comprise gold, silver, steel, nickel, aluminum, an alloy thereof, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the first member 12 and the second member 14 are each made of metal. In some embodiments, the first member 12 and/or the second member 14 comprises urethane polymer, an acrylic polymer, a fluoropolymer, polybenzamidazole, polyimide, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyetheretherketone, polyamide-imide, glass-based phenolic, polystyrene, cross-linked polystyrene, polyester, polycarbonate, polyethylene, polyethylene, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, polytetrafluoro-ethylene, polymethacrylate, nylon 6,6, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate, rigid vinyl, plasticized vinyl, or polypropylene. In some embodiments, all or a portion of the bent-rod shaped first member 12 is electroplated. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4, the second member 14 includes a clasp 16 that, in some embodiments, is rotatably engaged to an inverted u-shaped element 18. It will be appreciated that clasp 16 is an exemplary way to retain keys. For example, in some alternative embodiments, rather than a clasp 16, a key ring is used in the place of clasp 16. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure, the u-shaped element 18 is arranged to engage a hook 20 at a first end portion of the first member 12 in order to provide flexible engagement of the members 12 and 14. One of skill in the art will appreciate that there are numerous other methods by which members 12 and 14 can be flexibly engaged. For example, there can be a ring (not shown in FIG. 4) at the first end portion of the first member 12 that engages both hook 20 and u-shaped element 18. In another example, there can be a set of interlocking rings where a first ring in the set of interlocking rings engages hook 20 whereas a second ring in the set of interlocking rings engages u-shaped element 18. The first and second ring may interlock or there may be any number of interlocking rings between the first and second ring. In still another example, there can be a closed form element (not shown) that engages both hook 20 and u-shaped element 18. The closed form element may indeed be the shape of a ring or some other symmetrical shape such as an oval but the disclosure is not so limited. Any closed form shape, such as a polygon, star-shape, or the like can be used to interlock hook 20 to u-shaped element 18. In still another example, there can be a set of interlocking closed form elements where a first closed form element in the set of interlocking closed form elements engages hook 20 whereas a second closed form element in the set of interlocking closed form elements engages u-shaped element 18. The first and second closed form elements may interlock or there may be any number of interlocking closed form elements between the first and second closed form element. In some embodiments, a chain is used to interlock u-shaped element 18 to hook 20. It will be appreciated that hook 20 is just one example of a way to flexibly engage members 12 and 14 in the embodiment of the key locator 110 illustrated in FIGS. 4 through 6. For example, hook 20 can be completely closed off so that it is, in of itself, in fact a closed form shape such as a ring or oval. Similarly, it will be appreciated that u-shaped element 18 is just one example of a way to flexibly engage members 12 and 14. For example, rather than having a u-shaped element 18, a pivoting element can be used to flexibly engage members 12 and 14. In one aspect, referring to FIG. 4, a first end portion 12a of the first member 12 comprises a hook 20 for substantially permanently and flexibly engaging with the second member 14. The second member 14 comprises a closed form clasp 16 or ring (not shown) that is configured for selectively retaining at least one key or other type of object. In one such embodiment, the closed form clasp 16 or ring is rotatably fixed to a u-shaped element 18 of the second member 14, where the u-shaped element 18 is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the hook 20. In another such embodiment (not illustrated), the closed form clasp 16 or ring is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the hook 20. In another such embodiment, the closed form clasp 16 or ring is engaged with a closed form member, where the closed form member is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the hook. This closed form member could be, for example, a ring, an oval, a start shape, or any other closed form shape. In another such embodiment (not shown), the closed form clasp 16 or ring is engaged with a closed form member, where the closed form member is a ring that is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the hook 20. In still another such embodiment (not shown), the closed form clasp 16 or second ring is engaged with a chain, where the chain is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the hook. In yet another such embodiment (not shown), the closed form clasp 16 or second ring is engaged with first interlocking closed form elements in a plurality of interlocking closed form elements, where an interlocking closed form element in the plurality of interlocking closed form elements is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the hook. In some such embodiments, a closed form element in the plurality of closed form elements is a ring, an oval, a polygon, or a star-shape. In another aspect, a first end portion 12a of the first member 12 comprises a first ring (not shown) for substantially permanently and flexibly engaging with the second member 14. The second member 14 comprises a closed form clasp 16 or second ring (not shown) that is configured for selectively retaining at least one key or other type of object. In one such embodiment, the closed form clasp 16 or second ring is rotatably fixed to a u-shaped element 18 of the second member 14, where the u-shaped element 18 is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the first ring. In another such embodiment, the closed form clasp 16 or second ring is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the first ring. In another such embodiment, the closed form clasp 16 or second ring is engaged with a closed form member, where the closed form member is substantially permanently and flexibly engaged with the first ring.
