Furthermore, to the extent that the terms "including", "includes", "having", "has", "with", or variants thereof are used in either the detailed description and/or the claims, such terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term "comprising." [0018] The term "about" or "approximately" means within an acceptable error range for the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, which will depend in part on how the value is measured or determined, i.e., the limitations of the measurement system. For example, "about" can mean within 1 or more than 1 standard deviation, per the practice in the art. Alternatively, "about" can mean a range of up to 20%, preferably up to 10%, more preferably up to 5%, and more preferably still up to 1% of a given value. Alternatively, particularly with respect to biological systems or processes, the term can mean within an order of magnitude, preferably within 5-fold, and more preferably within 2-fold, of a value. Where particular values are described in the application and claims, unless otherwise stated the term "about" meaning within an acceptable error range for the particular value should be assumed. [0019] As used herein, the term "effective amount" means that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought, for instance, by a researcher or clinician. Furthermore, the term "therapeutically effective amount" means any amount which, as compared to a corresponding subject who has not received such amount, results in improved treatment, healing, prevention, or amelioration of a disease, disorder, or side effect, or a decrease in the rate of advancement of a disease or disorder. The term also includes within its scope amounts effective to enhance normal physiological function. [0020] As used herein, the term "bromodomain inhibitor" denotes a compound which inhibits the binding of a bromodomain with its cognate acetylated proteins. In one embodiment the bromodomain inhibitor is a compound which inhibits the binding of a bromodomain to acetylated lysine residues. In a further embodiment the bromodomain inhibitor is a compound which inhibits the binding of a bromodomain to acetylated lysine residues on histones, particularly histones Η3 and Η4.

In certain embodiments, the amount of compound in a provided composition is such that is effective to measurably inhibit one or more bromodomain-containing proteins (such as a BET protein, e.g., BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT), or a mutant thereof, in a biological sample or in a patient. In certain embodiments, a provided composition is formulated for administration to a patient in need of such composition. In some embodiments, a provided composition is formulated for oral administration to a patient. [00120] The term "patient," as used herein, means an animal, such as a mammal, such as a human. [00121] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle" refers to a non-toxic carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle that does not destroy the pharmacological activity of the compound with which it is formulated. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles that may be used in the compositions of this disclosure include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulosebased substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat. [00122] A "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" means any non-toxic salt, ester, salt of an ester or other derivative of a compound of this invention that, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a compound of this invention or an inhibitory active metabolite or residue thereof [00123] As used herein, the term "inhibitory active metabolite or residue thereof' means that a metabolite or residue thereof is also an inhibitor of one or more bromodomain-containing proteins (such as a BET protein, e.g., BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT), or a mutant thereof [00124] Compositions described herein may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The term "parenteral" as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra- articular, intra-synovial, intrastemal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques. [00125] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, com, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydro fur fury 1 alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. [00126] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. [00127] Injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. [00128] In order to prolong the effect of a provided compound, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactidepolyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. [00129] Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues. [00130] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. [00131] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, ℮) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents. [00132] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hardfilled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. [00133] Provided compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and micro crystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. [00134] Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel. [00135] Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions provided herein may also be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promotors to enhance bio availability, fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents. [00136] Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions provided herein may be formulated for oral administration. Such formulations may be administered with or without food. In some embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this disclosure are administered without food. In other embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this disclosure are administered with food. [00137] The amount of provided compounds that may be combined with carrier materials to produce a composition in a single dosage form will vary depending upon the patient to be treated and the particular mode of administration. Provided compositions may be formulate such that a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day of the inhibitor can be administered to a patient receiving these compositions. [00138] It should also be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the judgment of the treating physician, and the severity of the particular disease being treated. The amount of a provided compound in the composition will also depend upon the particular compound in the composition. (ii) Uses of Compounds and Pharmaceutically Acceptable Compositions [00139] Compounds and compositions described herein are generally useful for the inhibition of activity of one or more proteins involved in epigenetic regulation. Thus, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting one or more proteins involved in epigenetic regulation, such as proteins containing acetyl-lysine recognition motifs, also known as bromodomains (e.g., BET proteins, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT), by administering a provided compound or composition. [00140] Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence. Molecular mechanisms that play a role in epigenetic regulation include DNA methylation and chromatin/histone modifications. Chromatin recognition, in particular, is critical in many epigenetic phenomena. [00141] Chromatin, the organized assemblage of nuclear DNA and histone proteins, is the basis for a multitude of vital nuclear processes including regulation of transcription, replication, DNA-damage repair and progression through the cell cycle. A number of factors, such as chromatin-modifying enzymes, have been identified that play an important role in maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of chromatin (Margueron, et al. (2005) Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 15:163-176). [00142] Histones are the chief protein components of chromatin. They act as spools around which DNA winds, and they play a role in gene regulation. There are a total of six classes of histones (HI, Η2Α, Η2Β, Η3, Η4, and Η5) organized into two super classes: core histones (Η2Α, Η2Β, Η3, and Η4) and linker histones (HI and Η5). The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of about 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around the histone octamer, consisting of two copies each of the core histones Η2Α, Η2Β, Η3, and Η4 (Luger, et al. (1997) Nature 389:251-260). [00143] Histones, particularly residues of the amino termini of histones Η3 and Η4 and the amino and carboxyl termini of histones Η2Α, Η2Β and HI, are susceptible to a variety of posttranslational modifications including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ribosylation sumoylation, ubiquitination, citrullination, deimination, and biotinylation. The core of histones Η2Α and Η3 can also be modified. Histone modifications are integral to diverse biological processes such as gene regulation, DNA repair, and chromosome condensation. [00144] One type of histone modification, lysine acetylation, is recognized by bromodomain-containing proteins. Bromodomain-containing proteins are components of transcription factor complexes and determinants of epigenetic memory (Dey, et al. (2009) Mol. Biol. Cell 20:4899-4909). There are 46 human proteins containing a total of 57 bromodomains discovered to date. One family of bromodomain-containing proteins, BET proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT) have been used to establish proof-of-concept for targeting protein-protein interactions of epigenetic "readers," as opposed to chromatin-modifying enzymes, or so-called epigenetic "writers" and "erasers" (Filippakopoulos, et al. "Selective Inhibition of BET Bromodomains," Nature (published online September 24, 2010); Nicodeme, et al. "Suppression of Inflammation by a Synthetic Histone Mimic," Nature (published online November 10, 2010)). [00145] Examples of proteins inhibited by the compounds and compositions described herein and against which the methods described herein are useful include bromodomain-containing proteins, such as BET proteins, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT, or an iso form or mutant thereof. [00146] The activity of a provided compound, or composition thereof, as an inhibitor of a bromodomain-containing protein, such as a BET protein, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT, or an isoform or mutant thereof, may be assayed in vitro, in vivo, or in a cell line. In vitro assays include assays that determine inhibition of bromodomain-containing proteins, such as BET proteins, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT, or a mutant thereof. Alternatively, inhibitor binding may be determined by running a competition experiment where a provided compound is incubated with a bromodomain-containing protein, such as a BET protein, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT bound to known ligands, labeled or unlabeled. Detailed conditions for assaying a provided compound as an inhibitor of a bromodomain-containing protein, such as a BET protein, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT or a mutant thereof [00147] The invention provides for a method of treating a subject with a MYC-dependent cancer, comprising: identifying a subject in need of treatment; administering to the subject a BET inhibitor; determining at least one of MYC mRNA expression, MYC protein expression and tumor mass, and wherein following administration, there is a decrease in at least one of MYC mRNA expression, MYC protein expression and tumor mass, thereby treating the disease. [00148] In one embodiment, the identification step comprises determining whether the subject has at least one of a MYC translocation, a genetic rearrangement of MYC, MYC amplification, MYC over-expression and at least one cellular function that facilitates cellular and/or tumor growth and is altered upon reduction of MYC mRNA or protein expression. [00149] The invention also provides for a method of treating a subject with a MYC-dependent cancer, comprising: determining at least one of MYC mRNA expression, MYC protein expression and tumor mass; administering to the subject a BET inhibitor; and comparing at least one of MYC mRNA expression, MYC protein expression and tumor mass in the subject before and after administration of the BET inhibitor. [00150] The invention also provides a method of treating a subject with a MYC-dependent cancer, comprising: administering to the subject a BET inhibitor that is identified as capable of decreasing at least one of MYC mRNA expression, MYC protein expression and tumor mass; and determining at least one of MYC mRNA expression, MYC protein expression and tumor mass; wherein following the administration, there is a decrease in at least one of MYC mRNA expression, MYC protein expression and tumor mass, thereby treating the disease. [00151] The invention also provides for a method of treating a subject with a disease, comprising: administering a BET inhibitor that is identified as capable of decreasing at least one of MYC mRNA expression, MYC protein expression and tumor mass, wherein following the administration, there is a decrease in at least one of MYC mRNA expression, MYC protein expression and tumor mass, thereby treating the disease. [00152] Acetylated histone recognition and bromodomain-containing proteins (such as BET proteins) have been implicated in proliferative disease. BRD4 knockout mice die shortly after implantation and are compromised in their ability to maintain an inner cell mass, and heterozygotes display pre- and postnatal growth defects associated with reduced proliferation rates. BRD4 regulates genes expressed during M/Gl, including growth- associated genes, and remains bound to chromatin throughout the cell cycle (Dey, et al. (2009) Mol. Biol. Cell 20:4899-4909). BRD4 also physically associates with Mediator and P-TEFb (CDK9/cyclin Tl) to facilitate transcriptional elongation (Yang, et al. (2005) Oncogene 24:1653-1662; Yang, et al. (2005) Mol. Cell 19:535-545). CDK9 is a validated target in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and is linked to c-MYC-dependent transcription (Phelps, et al. Blood 113:2637-2645; Rahl, et al. (2010) Cell 141:432-445). [00153] BRD4 is translocated to the NUT protein in patients with lethal midline carcinoma, an aggressive form of human squamous carcinoma (French, et al. (2001) Am. J. Pathol. 159:1987-1992; French, et al. (2003) Cancer Res. 63:304-307). In vitro analysis with RNAi supports a causal role for BRD4 in this recurrent ΐ(15;19) chromosomal translocation. Pharmacologic inhibition of the BRD4 bromodomains results in growth arrest/differentiation of BRD4-NUT cell lines in vitro and in vivo (Filippakopoulos, et al. "Selective Inhibition of BET Bromodomains," Nature (published online September 24, 2010)). [00154] Bromodomain-containing proteins (such as BET proteins) have also been implicated in inflammatory diseases. BET proteins (e.g., BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT) regulate assembly of histone acetylation-dependent chromatin complexes that control inflammatory gene expression (Hargreaves, et al. (2009) Cell 138:129-145; LeRoy, et al. (2008) Mol. Cell 30:51-60; Jang, et al. (2005) Mol. Cell 19:523-534; Yang, et al. (2005) Mol. Cell 19:535-545). Key inflammatory genes (secondary response genes) are down-regulated upon bromodomain inhibition of the BET subfamily, and non-responsive genes (primary response genes) are poised for transcription. BET bromodomain inhibition protects against LPS-induced endotoxic shock and bacteria-induced sepsis in vivo (Nicodeme, et al. "Suppression of Inflammation by a Synthetic Histone Mimic," Nature (published online November 10, 2010)). [00155] Bromo domain-containing proteins (such as BET proteins) also play a role in viral disease. For example, BRD4 is implicated in human papilloma virus (HPV). In the primary phase of HPV infection of basal epithelia, the viral genome is maintained in an extrachromosomal episome. In some strains of HPV, BRD4 binding to the HPV Ε2 protein functions to tether the viral genome to chromosomes. Ε2 is critical for both the repression of Ε6/Ε7 and te activation of HPV viral genes. Disruption of BRD4 or the BRD4-E2 interaction blocks Ε2-dependent gene activation. BRD4 also functions to tether other classes of viral genomes to host chromatin (e.g., Herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr virus). [00156] As used herein, the terms "treatment," "treat," and "treating" refer to reversing, alleviating, delaying the onset of, or inhibiting the progress of a disease or disorder, or one or more symptoms thereof, as described herein. In some embodiments, treatment may be administered after one or more symptoms have developed. In other embodiments, treatment may be administered in the absence of symptoms. For example, treatment may be administered to a susceptible individual prior to the onset of symptoms (e.g., in light of a history of symptoms and/or in light of genetic or other susceptibility factors). Treatment may also be continued after symptoms have resolved, for example to prevent or delay their recurrence. [00157] In certain embodiments, a provided compound inhibits one or more of BRD2, BRD3, BRIM, BRDT, and/or another member of the bromodomain-containing proteins, or a mutant thereof. In some embodiments, a provided compound inhibits two or more of BRD2, BRD3, BRIM, BRDT, and/or another member of the bromo domain-containing proteins, or a mutant thereof. Provided compounds are inhibitors of one of more of the bromodomain-containing proteins, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT and are therefore useful for treating one or more disorders associated with activity of one or more of the bromodomain-containing proteins, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT. Thus, in certain embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating an bromodomain-containing protein-mediated disorder, such as a BET-mediated, a BRD2-mediated, a BRD3-mediated, a BRD4-mediated disorder, and/or a BRDT-mediated disorder comprising the step of inhibiting a bromodomain-containing protein, such as a BET protein, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT, or a mutant thereof, by administering to a patient in need thereof a provided compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof. [00158] As used herein, the terms "bromodomain-containing protein-mediated", "BET-mediated", "BRD2-mediated", "BRD3-mediated", "BRD4-mediated", and/or "BRDT-mediated" disorders or conditions means any disease or other deleterious condition in which one or more of the bromodomain-containing proteins, such as BET proteins, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and/or BRDT, or a mutant thereof, are known to play a role. [00159] Accordingly, another embodiment of the present invention relates to treating or lessening the severity of one or more diseases in which one or more of the bromodomain-containing proteins, such as BET proteins, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT, or a mutant thereof, are known to play a role. [00160] Diseases and conditions treatable according to the methods of this invention include, but are not limited to, cancer and other proliferative disorders, inflammatory diseases, sepsis, autoimmune disease, and viral infection. Thus one aspect is a method of treating a subject having a disease, disorder, or symptom thereof the method including administration of a compound or composition herein to the subject. In one embodiment, a human patient is treated with a compound of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle, wherein said compound is present in an amount to measurably inhibit bromodomain-containing protein activity (such as BET protein, e.g., BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT) in the patient.

[00170] In certain embodiments, the invention provides a method of treating a disorder (as described above) in a subject, comprising administering to the subject identified as in need thereof, a compound of the invention. The identification of those patients who are in need of treatment for the disorders described above is well within the ability and knowledge of one skilled in the art. Certain of the methods for identification of patients which are at risk of developing the above disorders which can be treated by the subject method are appreciated in the medical arts, such as family history, and the presence of risk factors associated with the development of that disease state in the subject patient. A clinician skilled in the art can readily identify such candidate patients, by the use of, for example, clinical tests, physical examination and medical/family history. [00171] A method of assessing the efficacy of a treatment in a subject includes determining the pre-treatment extent of a disorder by methods well known in the art (e.g., determining tumor size or screening for tumor markers where the cell proliferative disorder is cancer) and then administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, to the subject. After an appropriate period of time after the administration of the compound (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, one month, six months), the extent of the disorder is determined again. The modulation (e.g., decrease) of the extent or invasiveness of the disorder indicates efficacy of the treatment. The extent or invasiveness of the disorder may be determined periodically throughout treatment. For example, the extent or invasiveness of the disorder may be checked every few hours, days or weeks to assess the further efficacy of the treatment. A decrease in extent or invasiveness of the disorder indicates that the treatment is efficacious. The method described may be used to screen or select patients that may benefit from treatment with a compound of the invention.

[00212] The above-mentioned compounds, one or more of which can be used in combination with a provided compound, can be prepared and administered as described in the art. [00213] Provided compounds can be administered alone or in combination with one or more other therapeutic compounds, possible combination therapy taking the form of fixed combinations or the administration of a provided compound and one or more other therapeutic compounds being staggered or given independently of one another, or the combined administration of fixed combinations and one or more other therapeutic compounds. Provided compounds can besides or in addition be administered especially for tumor therapy in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, phototherapy, surgical intervention, or a combination of these. Long-term therapy is equally possible as is adjuvant therapy in the context of other treatment strategies, as described above. Other possible treatments are therapy to maintain the patient's status after tumor regression, or even chemopreventive therapy, for example in patients at risk. [00214] Such additional agents may be administered separately from a composition containing a provided compound, as part of a multiple dosage regimen. Alternatively, those agents may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together with a provided compound in a single composition. If administered as part of a multiple dosage regimen, the two active agents may be submitted simultaneously, sequentially or within a period of time from one another normally within five hours from one another. [00215] Upon improvement of a subject's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained when the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level, treatment should cease. The subject may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms. [00216] It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific inhibitory dose for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts. [00217] The total daily inhibitory dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a subject in single or in divided doses can be in amounts, for example, from 0.01 to 50 mg/kg body weight or more usually from 0.1 to 25 mg/kg body weight. Single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. In one embodiment, treatment regimens according to the present invention comprise administration to a patient in need of such treatment from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of the compound(s) of this invention per day in single or multiple doses. [00218] As used herein, the term "combination," "combined," and related terms refers to the simultaneous or sequential administration of therapeutic agents in accordance with this invention. For example, a provided compound may be administered with another therapeutic agent simultaneously or sequentially in separate unit dosage forms or together in a single unit dosage form. Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention provides a single unit dosage form comprising a provided compound, an additional therapeutic agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle for use in the methods of the invention. [00219] The amount of both, a provided compound and additional therapeutic agent (in those compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent as described above) that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Preferably, compositions should be formulated such that a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day of a provided compound can be administered. [00220] In those compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent, that additional therapeutic agent and the provided compound may act synergistically. Therefore, the amount of additional therapeutic agent in such compositions will be less than that required in a monotherapy utilizing only that therapeutic agent. In such compositions a dosage of between 0.01 - 1,000 g/kg body weight/day of the additional therapeutic agent can be administered. [00221] The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this disclosure will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably the amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that agent as the only therapeutically active agent. [00222] Provided compounds, or pharmaceutical compositions thereof, may also be incorporated into compositions for coating an implantable medical device, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Vascular stents, for example, have been used to overcome restenosis (re-narrowing of the vessel wall after injury). However, patients using stents or other implantable devices risk clot formation or platelet activation. These unwanted effects may be prevented or mitigated by pre-coating the device with a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a provided compound. Implantable devices coated with a compound of this invention are another embodiment of the present invention.
