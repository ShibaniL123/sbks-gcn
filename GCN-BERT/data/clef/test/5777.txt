[Step 3] Synthesis of N-(4-(hydrazinecarbonyl)benzyl)-N-phenylisonicotinamide
Methyl 4-((N-phenylisonicotinamido)methyl)benzoate (0.179 g, 0.517 mmol) synthesized in step 2, and hydrazine hydrate (0.488 mL, 10.335 mmol) were mixed in ethanol (10 mL), and the mixture was heated by microwave irradiation at 120Â°C for 1 hour, and then cooled to room temperature to terminate the reaction. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 12 g cartridge; methanol/methylene chloride = from 0% to 15%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.134 g, 74.9%) as a white solid.
