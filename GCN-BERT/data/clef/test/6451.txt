Step 4. Tert-butyl 4-((S)-2-(3-hydroxypropyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-3-methylpiperidine-1-carboxylate
To a solution of tert-butyl 4-((S)-2-(3-methoxy-3-oxopropyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-3-methylpiperidine-1-carboxylate (Example 46, Step 3, 2.5 g, 7.1 mmol) in diethyl ether (50 mL) was added LiAlH4 (2 M in THF, 5.3 mL, 10.6 mmol) at 0° C. The mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 4 h. Water (0.3 mL) was added to the reaction mixture followed by 15% aqueous NaOH (0.6 mL) then water (0.3 mL). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated to afford tert-butyl 4-((S)-2-(3-hydroxypropyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-3-methylpiperidine-1-carboxylate (2.2 g, 79%) as a colorless oil.
