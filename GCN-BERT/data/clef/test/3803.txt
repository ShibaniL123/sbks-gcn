TITLE OF THE INVENTION: IMPROVED NITRILE HYDRATASE Technical Field [0001] The present invention relates to an improved (mutant) nitrile hydratase and its production method. The present invention also relates to genomic DNA that encodes the enzyme,, a recombinant vector containing the genomic DNA, a transformant containing the recombinant vector, and. a method for producing an amide compound. Description of Background Art [0002] In recent years, a nitrile hydratase was found, which is an enzyme having nitrile hydrolysis activity that catalyses the hydration of a nitrile group to its corresponding amide group. Also, methods are disclosed to produce corresponding amide compounds from nitrile compounds using the enzyme or a microbial cell or the like containing the enzyme. Compared with conventional chemical synthetic methods, such methods are known by a high conversion rate or selectivity rate from a nitrile compound to a corresponding amide compound. [0003] Examples of microorganisms that produce a nitrile hydratase are the genus Corynebacterium, genus Pseudomonas, genus Rhodococcus, genus Rhizobium, genus Klebsiella, genus Pseudonocardia and the like. Among those, Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 strain has been used for industrial production of acrylamides,- and its usefulness has been verified. Furthermore, a gene encoding a nitrile hydratase produced by the J1 strain has been identified {see patent publication 1). Meanwhile, introduction of a mutation into a nitrile hydratase has been attempted not only as a way to use a nitrile hydratase isolated from naturally existing microorganisms or the gene of such a nitrile hydratase, but also as a way to change the activity, substrate specificity, Yraax, Km, heat stability, stability in a substrate, stability In a subsequent product and the like of a. nitrile hydratase (see patent publication 2). Nitrile.hydratase genes with improved heat resistance and amide-compound resistance have been produced by the inventors of the- present invention (patent publications 3 and 4). However, considering production costs such as the cost of catalysts when producing amide compounds, it is useful to dev ℮1ορ a mtrile hydratase with further improved heat resistance and amide-compound leststance. and enhanced, capability of reacting at a high temperature. Thus, obtaining enzymes with such improved properties is highly desired for the purpose of reducing the amount of enzymes needed for reacti ons, lowering production costs and the like.

Another desirable objective of the present invention is to provide a nitrile hydratase collected from genomic DNA encoding the protein, a recombinant vector containing the genomic DNA, a transformant containing the recombinant vector, and a culture of the transformant, as well as a method for producing such a nitrile hydratase.

[0017] As described above, a prosthetic molecule is bonded with a site identified as cysteine clusters ~SC(S/T)LCSC” (SEQ ID NO: 6-1 and 62) in an α subunit. Examples of a nitrile hydratase containing a binding site with such a prosthetic molecule are those that have amino-acid sequences and are encoded by genomic sequences derived from the following: Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 (PERM BP-1478), Rhodococcus rhodochrous Μ8 (SU 1731814), Rhodococcus rhodochrous Μ33 (VKM Ac~1515D), Rhodococcus rhodochrous AXCC 39484 (IP 2001-292772), Bacillus smithii (JP Η9-248188), Pseudonoeardia thermophila (JPH9-275978), or Geobacillus thermoglucosidasrus.

[0035] In. the alignment of the p-subunit of a nitrile hydratase derived from the. 11 strain shown as SEQ ID NO: 2 , the positions of'amino acids to- be substituted in the present invention include 167, 219, 57, 1.14, 107, 218, 190, 168, 144, 133, 112,105, 95,17 and 15. For example, if it is a Pseodonoeardia thermophila, positions of amino acids to be substituted in the amino-acid sequence are 164, 21.6, 57,114,107,215,187, .165,141, 129, 108, .1.02, 92, 17 and 15. Moreover, as for positions of amino acids to be substituted in the present invention, positions 124 and 174 of the a-subunit of the J1 strain of nitrile hydratase identified as SEQ ID NO: 4 and positions 130 and .180 of Pseudonocardia thermophila are also included. [0036] Aligning the amino-acid sequence is not limited to any specific method. For example, a genomic sequence analysis- software such as GENTXY (Nippon Genetics Co, Ltd.), DNASIS (Hitachi Solutions, Ltd.), or a free software CLUSTALW or BLAST maybe used. FIGs, 2-1, 2-:2, 3-1 and 3-2 show the alignment .results obtained by using version 7, GENETXY (default setting, Nippon Genetics Co., Ltd.) [0037] The improved nitrile hydratase activity of the present invention shows enhanced heat resistance, amide-compound resistance and high-temperature accumulation properties compared with a wild-type nitrile- hydratase activity retaining the naturally existing original characteristics. [0038] Here, “nitrile hydratase activity” means an enzymatic activity to catalyze the hydration for converting a nitrile compound to a corresponding amide- compound (RGN+HjO-^RCGNHj). Determining the act i ν i iy is conducted by bringing a nitrile compound as a substrate into contact with a nitrile hydratase for conversion to a corresponding amide compound and by measuring the resultant amide compound. Any nitrile- compound may be used as a substrate as long as nitrile hydratase reacts with such the compound, but acrylonitrile is preferred. Reaction conditions are a substrate concentration, of 2.5%, reaction temperature of 1'0’G to 30°C and duration of 10-30 minutes. The enzymatic reactions are terminated by adding phosphoric acid. Then, using HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography), the prod uced -acrylamide is analyzed to measure the amount of the amide compound. WQ20!i [0040] In addition, the presence of nitrile hydratase activity is simply examined by activity staining. For example, if anthranilonitrile is used as a. substrate, since anthranilamide converted by a nitrile hydratase yields fluorescent, nitrile hydratase'activity is easily detected at high sensitivity (reference: Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek, 80(2): 169-183, 2001). [0041] “Improved heat resistance” means that theremainingactivity of a heat-treated improved strain is at least 10% higher than the remaining activity of the comparative example treated the same way. The method for heat treatment is to- supply a liquid culture, or collected and washed bacterial-cell culture, in a container and to- place the contai ner in a heating device such as a water bath or i ncubator so as to maintain the temperature for a predetermined duration. At that time, to enhance the stability of the enzyme, a nitrile compound or an amide compound may he added for such heat treatment. For treatment conditions, the temperature and duration are preferred to be set in such a way that the activity of the comparative example becomes no more than 5.0% of that prior to the heat treatment. In particular, heat treatment is- preferred to be performed in a temperature range of 50°C to 70*C for 5 minutes to 60 minutes. Remaining activity means the ratio of the amount of an amide compound produced by heat-treated bacterial cells for activity measurement to the amount of an amide compound produced by the same amount ol untreated bacterial cells for activity measurement. Untreated bacterial cells are those in a liquid culture or collected and washed bacterial-cell culture, which are refrigerated at a temperature of 4°'C. The comparative example in the present invention is a transformant into which pER855A is introduced. When a nitrile hydratase shows a .remaining activity at least .10% higher than that of the comparative strain, the heat resistance of the nitrile hydratase is conformed to be improved. “Amino-compound resistance” means-that a nitrile hydratase can maintain its activity in the presence of an amide compound. A cultured transformant containing an improved nitrile hydratase, or an improved nitrile hydratase isolated from, the transformant, .is analyzed in the presence of an amide compound, such -as acrylamide (at a high concentration of 30-50%, for example) to examine the consumption amount or consumption rate of a nitrile compound such as acrylonitrile for a substrate. When the consumption amount or consumption rate exceeds 1.01 times that of the compara tive example, the nitrile hydratase is confirmed to be resistant to amide compounds, (0043] “High-temperature accumulation properties'5 means that a nitrile hydratase is capable of producing acrylamide at a high concentration exceeding 35% at a reaction temperature of 20 C or higher. Enzymatic reactions of a cultured transformant containing an improved nitrile hydratase, or an improved nitrile hydratase isolated from the transformant, are continued by adding acrylonitrile, and then the concentration of a produced acrylamide is analyzed. Acrylonitrile may be added while the acrylonitrile content in the reaction mixture is controlled, or may be added sequentially to continue reactions. High temperature in the present application means a reaction temperature of 20°C or higher. When the concentration of produced acrylamide exceeds that of the comparati ve example* the high-temperature accumulation properties of the improved nitrile hydratase is evaluated to be enhanced. An example of atni.de compounds is represented by general formula {.1) below: R-CONHa (1) (Here, “R” is a straight-chain or branched alkyl or alkenyl group having 1-IQ carbon atoms with an optional substituent, a eycloalkyl group or all-yl group having 3-18 carbon atoms with an optional substituent* or a saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic group with an optional substituent.) Especially, an acrylamide, is preferred to have “CI;i2=GH~” as “R5* in the formula. [0044] The above improved nitrile hydratase is obtained by substituting amino acids of a wild-type nitrile hydratase. For example, the improved nitrile hydratase is obtained by modifying the amino-acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2 and/or 4) of a nitrile hydratase derived from Rhodococeus rhodochrous J1 strain and by selecting a nitrile hydratase with enhanced heat resistance and/or amide-compound resistance. [0045] Rhodococeus rhodochrous JJ. strain is internationally registered as FERM BP-1478 at the International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Central. 6, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki), deposited September 18, 1987. [0046] In nitrile hydratases other than the J1 strain, enzymes with a highly homologous amino-acid sequence are thought to acquire enhanced heat resistance and/or amide-compound resistance through the mutation above. [00473 As for such strains. Bacillus smithii (JP Η09-248188), Pseudonocardia thermophiia (JP Η09-275978), Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius and the like are listed, Especially preferred are Rhodococeus-rhodochrous MS ($U 1731814) and Rhodococeus rhodochrous M33 (VKM Ac-1515D), in which amino-acid homology is 90% or higher (high homology enzymes are listed). Rhodococeus rhodochrous Μ33 (VKM Ac-1515D) is selected as a result of the natural mutation of the MB strain (SU 173181.4) above, and is capable of constitutive expression of nitrile hydratase, but the amino-acid sequence, or genomic sequence of the nitrile hydratase itself is not. .modified (USP 5,827.699), [0048] Methods for conducting amino-acid substitution on a wild-type nitrile hydratase are as follows: a bacterium having-nitrile hydratase activity is brought into contact for reactions with chemicals such as hydroxy! amine or nitrous acid as a mutation source; UV rays are irradiated to induce mutation; error-prone. PGR or site-directed mutagenesis is employed to introduce a imitation at random into the gene that encodes a nitrile hydratase; and the like. (b-1) Method for Introducing Random Mutation To study functions, and characteristics of proteins using a mutant,, random mutagenesis is known. Random, mutagenesis is a method to introduce a random mutation to the gene encoding a specific protein so that a mutant is produced. In random mutagenesis by PCR, stringency conditions are set low during DMA amplification to introduce mutation in a base sequence (error-prone PCR). [0050] In such an error-prone PCR method, a mutation is introduced randomly into any position of the entire DNA site to be amplified. Then , by examining the function of the obtained mutant into which a mutation was introduced randomly, information of amino acids or domains important for the specific functions of a protein is obtained. [005.1] For a nitrile hydratase as the template of error-prone PCR, the nitrile hydratase gene derived from a wild type strain or DNA obtained as an. amplified product by error-prone PCR. are used. A.s reaction conditions for error-prone PCR, for example, a composition ratio of any one, two or three among dNTP (dGTP, dCTP, dATP or dTTP) in the reaction mix is reduced relative to another dNTP. hi so setting, during the .DNA synthesis, at a position that requires a dNTP whose ratio is reduced, another dNTP is more likely to be used by error, and that may lead to mutation. In addition, other preferred reaction conditions are a composition in. which, the amount of MgCb and/or MnCh in the reaction mix is increased. [0053] (b-2) Improved nitrile hydratase derived from Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 strain and its gene An improved nitrile hydratase of the present invention includes the gene encoding a protein into which mutations shown in Table 1 are introduced. [0054] Based on. a wild-type nitrile hydratase gene, DNA that encodes such an improved nitrile hydratase is produced by site-directed mutagenesis methods described inMolecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition*published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989),Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons (1987-1997) and the- like. To Introduce a mutation into DNA by well-known methods such as the Kunkei method or the Gapped Duplex method, mutagenesis kits applying site-directed mutagenesis methods such as follows are used: Quick€hange!:v!XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (made by Stratagene), GeneTailor1^ Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (made by Jnvitrogen Corporation). TaKaRa Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Mutan-K. Mutan-Super Express Km and. the like, made by Takara Bio Inc.) and the like. [0055] Furthermore, a, gene related to the present in vention includes DNA which is hybridized under stringent conditions with a DNA made up of a base sequence complementary to the base sequence of the gene of the present, in vention, and which encodes a protein having nitrile hydratase activity. [0056] Such an improved nitrile hydratase gene is obtained by introducing a mutation into a wild-type gene as described above. Alternatively, using the genomic sequence or its complementary sequence or a. DNA fragment as a probe, improved nitrile hydratase gene may also be obtained from cDNA libraries and genomic libraries by employing well-known hybridization methods such as colony hybridization, plaque hybridization. Southern bl ot or the like. Libraries constructed by a well-known method may be used, or commercially available cDNA libraries and genomic libraries may also be used. [0057] “Stringent conditions'' are those for washing after hybridization; a salt concentration of 300-2000 mM, a temperature of 40-73Τ(, preferably a salt concentration of 60Q-900 mM, and a temperature of 65X7. For example, conditions 2-xSSC at 50! C may be employed. In addition to such a salt concentration of the buffer, temperature and the like, a person skilled in the art may set conditions for obtaining DMA that encodes a n itrile hydratase of the present invention by adding various conditions such as probe concentration, probe length and reaction time. [0058] For detailed procedures for hybridization,Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual 2nd edition (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (198·9)) and the like may be referred to. DNA to be hybridized includes DNA or its fragment, containing a base sequence which is at least 40%, preferably 60%, more preferably 90% or greater, homologous to the genomic DNA of the present invention. [0059] An amino acid {amino acid after substitution) that substitutes a specific amino acid residue in the amino-acid, sequence of a wild-type nitrile hydratase is not limited to any specific type, and may be selected properly as long as the polypeptide (protein) that includes the amino acid after substitution exhibits nitrile hydratase activity. [0060] (c) Recombinant. Vector, Transformant It is necessary for a nitrile hydratase gene to be put into a vector so that nitrile hydratase. is expressed in the host organism to be transformed. Examples of such vectors are plasmid DNA, bacteriophage DNA, retrotransposon DNA, artificial chromosome DNA and the like. In addition, a host to be used in the present invention is not limited to any specific type as long as the. target nitrile hydratase is expressed after the recombinant vector is introduced into the host. Examples are bacteria such as Ε. coli and Bacillus subtijis, yeasts, animal cells, insect cells, plant cells and the like. When Ε. coli is used as a host. an expression vector with high expression efficiency, such as expression vector pkk 233-2 with a tic promoter (made by Amersliam Biosciences Corp.), pTrc 99 A (made by Amersham Biosciences Cops.) or the like, is preferred. [0062] fn .addition.to a nitrile hydratase gene, a vector may be coupled with a promoter, terminator, enhancer, splicing signal, poly A addition signal, selection marker, ribosome binding sequence (SB sequence) or the like. Examples of selection markers are a kanamycin resistance gene, dihydrofolate reductase gene, ampieillm resistance gene, neomycin resistance gene and the like, [0063] When a bacterium is used as a host, Escherichia coli may be used, for example, and a Rhodococcus strain such as Rhodococcus rhodochrous ATCC 12674, Rhodococcus rhodochrous ATCC 17895 and Rhodococcus rhodochrous ATCC 19140 may also be used. Those ATCC strains are obtained from the American type culture collection. [0064] When Ε. coli is used as a host for producing a transformant to express a nitrile hydratase, since most of the expressed nitri le hydratases are formed as inclusion bodies and are insoluble, a transformant with low catalytic activity is obtained. On the other hand, if a Rhodococcus strain is. used as a host, nitrile hydratase is present in the soluble fraction and a transformant with high activity is obtained. Those transformants may be selected based on purposes. However, when an improved enzyme is selected under stringent conditions, a transformant with high activity derived from a. Rhodococcus strain is preferred. [0065] Introducing a recombinant vector into a bacterium is not limited to any specific method as long as DNA is introduced into the bacterium. For example, a method using calcium ions, electroporation or the like may be employed, [0066] When yeast is used as a host, examples are Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Pichia pastoris and the like. As a method for introducing a recombinant vector into yeast, it is not limited specifically as long as DNA is introduced into the yeast. For example, an electroporation method, spberoplast method, lithium acetate method or the like may be employed, [0067] When animal cells are used as a host, monkey cells COS-7, Vero, CHO cells, mouse L cells, rat GH3 cells, human FL cells or the like may be employed. As a method for introducing a recombinant vector into an animal cell, for example,, an electroporation method, calcium phosphate method, lipofection method or the' like may be used. [0068] When insect cells are Used as a host, Sf9 cells, SOI cells and the like may be used. As a method for introducing a recombinant vector into an insect cel l for example, a calcium phosphate method, lipofection method, electroporation method or the like may be used. [0069] When plant cells are used as a host, tobacco BY-2 cells or the like may be used. However, that is not the only option. A method for introducing a recombinant vector into a plant cell, for example, an Agrobacterium method, particle gun method, PEG method, electroporation method or the like may be used. [0070] id) Method for Producing Culture and Improved Nitrile H'ydratase An improved nitrile liydratase of the present invention is obtained by incubating the above transformant and by collecting from the obtained culture. [0071] The present invention also relates to a method for producing an improved nitrile hydratase, and the method is characterized by collecting an improved nitrile liydratase from the culture above. γ·ο .'a! in the present invention, “culture” means culture supernatant, cultured cells, cultured bacterial cells, cell homogenates or bacterial-cell homogenates.. Incubation of a transformant of the present invention, is cond ucted by a generally used method for incubating a host. The target nitrile hydratase is accumulated in the culture. As for a culture, to incubate a transformant of the present invention, any natural or synthetic culture medium is used as long as it contains a carbon source, a nitrogen source, inorganic salts or the like for the host bacteria to assimilate, and incubation of a transformant is performed efficiently. Examples of a. carbon source are carbohydrates such as glucose, galactose, fructose, sucrose, raffinose and starch; organic acids such as acetic acid and propionic acid; alcohols such as ethanol and propanol; and the like. Examples of a nitrogen source are inorganic acids' such as ammonia, ammonium chloride-, ammonium sulfate, ammonium acetate and ammonium phosphate; ammonium salts of organic acids; and other nitrogen-containing compounds. [0074] In addition, peptone, yeast extract, meat extract, corn steep liquor, various amino acids or the like may also be used. Examples of minerals are monopotas.sium phosphate, potassium diliydrogenphosphate, magnesium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, calcium carbonate and the like. Al so, if necessary, a defoaming agent may be used to prevent foaming during the incubation process. Moreover, cobalt ions or iron ions as prosthetic molecules of a nitrile hydratase, or nitriles and amides as an inducer of the enzyme, may also be added to the culture. Incubation may be conducted by adding selective pressure to prevent the vector and the target gene from being eliminated. Namely, if a selection marker is a drug-resistant gene, a corresponding chemical agent may be added: or if a selection marker is an auxotrophic complementary gene, corresponding nutrition.factors may be removed. [0076] Also, if a selection marker has a genetic assimilation trait, an equivalent assimilation factor may be added as a sole factor if necessary. For example, when Ε. coli transformed by a vector containing an anipici! iin-resistant gene is incubated, ampicillm may be added as needed during the incubation process. [0077] When incubating a transformant transformed by an expression vector containing an inducible promoter, such an inducer may be added to the culture if necessary. For example, when incubating a transformant transformed by an expression vector with a promoter inducible with isopropyl-p-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), IPTG or the like may be added to the culture. Likewise, when incubating a transformant transformed by an expression vector with a trp promoter inducible with indoleacetic acid (1ΑΑ), IAA. or the like may be added to the culture, [0078] Incubation, conditions of a transformant are not limited specifically as long as the productivity of the target nitrile hydratase and growth of the host are not prohibited. Generally, conditions are preferred to be 10°C~40*C, more preferably 2CTC-37T1 for 5-100 hours. The pH value is adjusted using inorganic or organic acid, alkaline solution or the like. If it Is an Ε. coli, the pH is adjusted to he 6-9. [0079] As' for incubation, methods,, solid-state culture, static culture, shaking culture, aeration-agitation culture and the like may be used. When an. Ε. coli transformant is Incubated, it is especially preferred.to use shaking culture or aeration-agitation culture (jar fermentation) under aerobic conditions. [0080] When incubated in culture conditions above, the improved nitrile hydratase of the present invention is accumulated at a high yield in the above culture medium, namely, al least in any of culture supernatant, cell culture, bacterial-cell culture, cell homogenates or bacterial-cel 1 homogenates. [0081] When an improved nitrile hydratase is incubated and produced in a cell or bacterial cell, the target nitrile hydratase is collected by homogenizing the cell or bacterial cell Cells or bacterial cells are homogenized by high-pressure treatment using a French press or homogenizer, supersonic treatment, grinding treatment using glass beads or the like, enzyme treatment using lysozyme, cellulose, pectinase and the like, freezing and thawing treatment, hypotonic solution treatment, bacteriolysis induction treatment by phage, and so on. After the homogenization process, residues of the cell homogenates or bacterial-cell homogenates (including insoluble fractions of the cell extract) are removed if necessary. To remove residues, centrifugal ox filtration methods are employed. To increase the efficiency of removing residues, a coagulant or filter aid may be used. The supernatant obtained after the .removal of residues is soluble fractions of the cell extract, -which are used as a crudely purified improved nitrile bydratase solution. [0083] Also, when an improved nitrile hydratase is produced in cells or bacterial cells, it is an option to collect the cells or bacterial cells themselves by a centrifuge or membrane filtration and to use without homogenizing them. [0084] When, an improved nitrile hydratase is produced outside the cells or bacterial cells, the culture may be used as is, or the. cells or bacterial cells are removed using a centrifugal or filtration method. Then, the improved nitrile hydratase is collected from the culture by being extracted through ammonium sulfate precipitation, if necessary. Furthermore, dialysis or various chromatography techniques (gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, etc.) may be used to isolate and purify the nitrile hydratase. [0085] To check the production yield of a nitrile hydratase. obtained by incubating a transformant is not limited to using any specific method, but SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), nitrile hydratase activity measurements- or the like may be used to determine the yield per culture, per wet or dry weight in a bacterial cell, or per crude enzymatic protein, SDS-PAGE may be conducted by a method well known by a person skilled in the art. Also, the activity described above may be applied to nitrile hydratase activity. [0086] Without using any living cells, an improved nitrile hydratase of the present invention may be produced using a cell-free protein synthesis system, [0087] in a cell-free protein synthesis system, a protein is produced in an artificial vessel such as a test tube using a cell extract. A cell-free protein synthesis system used in the present application includes a cell-free transcription system that synthesizes RNA using DNA as a template. [0088] In such a case, an organism corresponding to the above host is the organism from which the cell extract is derived. Here, for the cell extract, extracts of eukaryotic or prokaryotic origin, such as the extract from wheat germ. Β, coll and the like, may be used. Such, cell extracts may he concentrated or not, [0:089] The cell extract is obtained by uitrailltration, dialysis, polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation or the like. In the present invention, a commercially available kit may also be used for cell-free protein synthesis. Examples of such a kit are a reagent kit PRQTEfOSIM (Toyobo), TNTilVl system (Promega ΚΧ), a synthesizer PG-Mate™ (Toyobo), RTS (Roche Diagnostics) and the like. [0090] An improved nitrile hydratase obtained by cell-free protein synthesis as described above is also' purified by properly selecting a chromatography type. [0091] 2. Method for Producing Amide Compound The improved nitrile hydratase obtained above is used as an enzymatic catalyst when producing material. For example, an amide compound is produced by bringing a nitrile compound into contact with the improved nitrile hydratase. Then, the amide compound produced upon contact is collected. Accordingly, an amide compound is produced [0092] The isolated and purified nitrile hydratase as described abo ve is used as an enzymatic catalyst. In addition, a gene is introduced so as to express an improved nitrile hydratase in a proper host as described above and the culture after the host is incubated or the processed products of the culture may also be used. Processed products are, for example, incubated cells immobilized with acrylamide gel or the like, those processed by glutaraldehyde, those supported by inorganic carriers such as alumina, silica, zeolite, diatomaceous earth and the like. [0093] Here, “contact” means that an improved nitrile hydratase and a nitrile compound are present in.the same reaction system or incubation system: for example, an isolated and purified improved nitrile hydratase and a nitrile compound are mixed; a nitrile compound is added into a incubation vessel of a cell to express an. improved nitrile hydratase gene: cells are incubated in the presence of a nitrile compound; a cell extract is mixed with .a nitrile compound; and so on. [0094] A nitrile compound as a substrate is selected by considering the substrate specificity of the enzyme, stability of the enzyme in the substrate and the like. As for a nitrile compound, acrylonitrile is preferred. The reaction method and the method for collecting an. amide compound after the completion of reactions are properly selected depending on the characteristics of the substrate and the enzymatic catalyst. [0095] The enzymatic catalyst is preferred to be recycled as long as its activity is not deactivated. From the viewpoint of preventing deactivation and of recycling ease, the enzymatic catalyst is preferred to be used as a processed product, EXAMPLES In. the following, examples of the present invention are described in detail However, present invention is not limited to those. EXAMPLE 1 [0097] Obtaining Improved Nitrile Hydratase Gene and Evaluation thereof (1) (1) Construction of Mutant Gene Library The plasmid used as a template was plasmid ρΕΚ855Α (FIG, 1} modified from plasmid pER855 (see JP 2010-172295) as follows: in the β subunit of the amino-acid sequence (SBQ ID NO: 2), the amino-acid residue positioned at 1.67'downstream from the N-terminal amino-acid residue was mutated from asparagine (Ν) to serine (S); the amino-acid residue positioned at 21.9 downstream from the N-terminal amino-acid residue above was mutated from valine (V) to alanine (A); the amino-acid residuepositioned at 57 downstream from the Ν-terminal amino-acid residue above was mutated from serine (S) to methionine (Μ); the amino-acid residue positioned at 114 downstream from the N-terminal amino-acid residue above was mutated front lysine (Κ) to. tyrosine (Υ); and the amino-acid residue positioned at 107 downstream from the N-terminal amino-acid residue abo ve was mutated from threonine (!) to. lysine. (Κ). [0098] Plasmid pSJC)34 used as a vector is capable of expressing a nitrile hydratase in a Rhodococeus strain, and was prepared..from pSJ023 using a method described in JP Η10-337185. Here, pSJ023 is a transformant “R. rhodochrous ATCC-12674/pSJ023,” and is internationally registered as PERM BP-6232 at the International Patent Organism Depositary; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Central 6, 1-1-1 Higashi.,Tsukuba, Ibaraki), deposited March 4, 1997. First, a mutation was introduced into the nitrile hydratase gene using the following method.

Accordingly, the plasmid template was removed. After that, the reaction mixture was purified using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega ΚΚ), and transformation was introduced into JM109 by the purified PCR reaction product A few thousand obtained colonies were collected from the plate, and plasmid DNA was extracted using QlAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) to construct a mutant-gene library, [0101] (2) Producing Rliodocoecus Trans.tbrm.ant The cells of Rliodocoecus rhodoc-hrous strain ATCC 12674 at a logarithmic growth phase were collected by a centrifugal separator, washed with ice-cooled sterile water three times and suspended in the. sterile water. Then, 1 pL of plasmid prepared m ( I) above and 10 pL of the bacterial-cell suspension were mixed and ice-cooled. The plasmid DNA and the bacterial-cell suspension were supplied into a cuvette, and electric pulse treatment was conducted at. 2,0 KV and 200 Ω using an electroporation device, Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc,). [0102] The cuvette with file mixture processed by electric pulses was let stand for 10 minutes under ice-cold conditions, and a heat-shock treatment was conducted at 37*C for 10 minutes. Then, 500 μℓ,- of an ΜΥΚ culture medium (0.5% poiypeptone, 0.3% Baeto yeast extract, 0.3% Bacio malt extract, 0.2% KTIPCb, 0.2% KTKPO.-i) was added and let stand at 30'G for 5 hours, and the strain was applied, onto an ΜΥΚ agar medium containing 50 pg/mL kanamyein. The colony obtained afiei incubating at 30"C for 3 days was used as a transformant. In the same manner, transformant pERS55A was prepared as a comparative strain. [0103] (3) Amide Treatment on Rhodococcus Transformant The Rhodococcus transformant containing a nitrile hydratase gene obtained in (2) above and ATCC. 12674/pER855A as a comparative strain were used for screening. In a 96-hole deep-well plate, I roL each of a GGPK culture medium (1,5% glucose, 1% sodium glutafnate, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.05% ΚΤΐΡΟ4, 0.05% KHiP Ο4, 0.05% MgSOy7H2Os 1% CoCL, 0.1% urea, 50 pg/mL kanamyein, pH at 7.2) was supplied. In each culture medium, the above strain was inoculated, and liquid culture was carried out at 30*C for 3 days. [0104] Next, 30 μ1. of the liquid culture obtained above was dispensed, in a 96-hole plate and the culture medium was -removed by centrifugation. Lastly, 40 pL of 50% acrylamide solution was added to suspend the bacteria. The transformant suspended in a high-concentration aerylanii.de solution was put in an incubator to completely deactivate the comparative strain through heat treatment-conducted at 50"C for 3Q minutes, The remaining nitrile hydratase activity was measured as follows. [0105] First, after the acrylamide treatment, the transformant was washed with a 50 κΐΜ phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and the activity was measured by the following method. The washed transformant and 50 τηΜ phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) were supplied to a test tube and pre.incuba.ted at 30Χ for 10 minutes, and an equivalent volume of a 5% acrylonitrile solution (pH 7.0) was added and reacted for 10 minutes. Then, one tenth volume of 1. Μ phosphoric acid was added to terminate the reaction. Next the transformant was removed from the terminated reaction mixture-by a centrifuge, and the mixture was diluted to a proper concentration for analysis by HPLC (WAKOSIL 5C8 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) 250 mm long, 10% acetonitrile containing 5 mM phosphoric acid, flow rate of mobile phase at 1 niL/min, wavelength of a UV absorption detector 260 am). Using untreated cells for which acrylamide treatment was not conducted, activity was measured for comparison. Then, based on the obtained activity values, the activity remaining after the completion of acrylamide treatment was determined. [0106] Among hundreds of transformants each containing a nitrile hydratase- gene into which a mutation was introduced, as above, four strains of mutant enzymes showing resistance to a. high concentration of acrylamide were selected as shown in Table 3. mutant strain No. name of plasmid 1 OFRO03 2 PFR0G4 3 pFROOS 4 pFROOi [0107] Table 3 [0108] (4) Confirming Base Sequence To confirm the base sequence of a nitrile hydratase gene, plasmid was recovered from the selected strains. The Rhodococcus transformant was inoculated into 10 mL of an ΜΥΚ culture medium (0.5% pol.ypept.one, 0.3% Bacto yeast extract, 0.3% malt extract, 1% glucose, 50 pg/mL kanamycin) and incubated lor 24 hours, and a 20% sterile glycine solution was added to make the final concentration of 2%, which was further incubated for another 24 hours. Then, the bacterial cells were recovered by a centrifuge, washed with TBS buffer (.10 mM Tris-HCl (ρΗ8)-10 mM NaCi-1 mM EDI A), suspended in 2 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pi-1.8)-12.5%) sucrose-100 mM Na€l-i rng/niL lysozyme, and shaken at 37"Cfor 3 hours. Then, 0,4 ml, of 10% SDS was added -and the mixture was shaken gently for an hour at room, temperature, to which 2,1 mL of 5 Μ sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.2) was added and let stand in- ice for an hour. Next, the mixture was centrifuged for an hour at 10,000 xg at 4"'C to obtain a supernatant,, to which a 5-times volume of ethanol was added and let stand at --20Τ- for 3.0 minutes. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 xg, for 20 minutes. The precipitant was washed with 10 mL of 70% ethanol and dissolved in 100 pL of a ΤΕ buffer. Accordingly, a DNA solution was obtained. [0109] Next; the sequence including a nitrile hydratase was amplified by a PCR method. < composition of PCR reaction mixture> template plasmid 1 μΕ 10:< PCR buffer (made by NEB) 10 μΕ primer NB-19 (50 μΜ) 1 μΤ primer NH-20 (50 μΜ) I μΕ 2.5 idM dNTPraix 8 μΕ sterile -water 79 μ1.

Ρβ173 [0111] Table 4 [ON 2] (5) Evaluation of Amide-Compound Resistance The amide-compound resistance of the improved nitrile hydratases obtained in (4) above was evaluated by the following method. ATCC12674/pER855A and each transformant obtained in step (2) above were brought into contact with 10 ml. of an Μ ΥΚ. culture medium (50 ug/mL kananiyein), and subjected to shaking culture at 30°C for 2 days. Then, 1% of each culture was inoculated into 100 ml- of a GGPK culture medium < 1.5% glucose, 1% sodium glutamate, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.05% KHIFCR, 0.05% KEEP Ο4, 0,05% MgSCKNHbO, 1% CoCb, '0.1% urea, 50 pg/mL kanamyein, pH 7,2), and subjected to shaking culture at 30‘'C for 3 days. Then, bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation. The enzyme acti vity of the obtained cultured cel ls was m easured by the following method : 0.2 niL of the bacterial cell mixture -and 4.8 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) were mixed, to which 5 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5.0% (w/v) acrylonitrile was further added. Next, the mixture was: reacted while being shaken at 1G°C for 10 minutes. Then, bacterial, cells were filtered and the amount of produced acrylamide was measured using gas chromatography, <analysis condition^ analysis instrument: detector: column: col Hum ternperature-: Nitrile hydratase activity was determined by conversion from the amount of acry lamide. Here, regarding nitrile hydratase activity* the amount of enzyme to produce 1 pmol of acrylamide per 1 minute is. set as 1 U. gas chromatograph GC-14B (Shimadzu Corporation) FID (detection at 200’G) 1m glass column filled with PoraPak.

ATCC 12674/pER855A was used as a comparison strain. <composition of reaction mixture'* 50% acrylamide solution: .94 g acrylonitrile 4 g 1Μ phosphate buffer: 1 g bacterial fluid (same unit (U) of enzymatic activity) <reaction conditions> reaction for 5 hours while being stirred (30*C) [0115] Before the start, of reaction t0 hour) and 5 hours after the start of reaction, 1 mL of the reaction mixture was taken for sampling, which was then filtered by a 0.45 μτη filter. The obtained filtrate was put through gas chromatography. The proportion of remaining acrylonitrile was analyzed. The results are shown in Table 5.

EXAMPLE 6 [0I3S] Using transformants- obtained in Example 5, their acrylamide accumulation properties during high-temperature reactions was evaluated. [0139] In a plastic tube with a lid. 10 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer and a transformant were added and preincubated for 10 minutes while the tube was shaken in a 40’C water bath. Next, 1 mL of acrylonitrile was added to each reaction mixture and a reacti on was started. After the start of the reaction, 1 rnL each of acrylonitrile at predetermined timing (20 minutes, 40 minutes, 1 hour, 1 1/2 hours, 2 hours) was added to continue the reaction . The reaction mixture 3 hours after the start of the reaction was filtered and the acrylamide concentration of the filtrate was determined by gas chromatography.
