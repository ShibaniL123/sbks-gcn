EXPANDABLE WOUND DRESSINGS Jeffry Skiba [001] The present application claims priority to United States Provisional Patent Application Numbers 61/818,797 filed May 2, 2013, 61/821,362, filed May 9, 2013, and 61/821,365, filed May 9, 2013, each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. FIELD [002] in the 1960s, George Winter demonstrated that wounds kept moist healed faster than those exposed to the air or covered with traditional dressings. Various types of dressings can be used to accomplish different objectives including: a. Controlling moisture content, so that the wound stays moist or dry; b. Protecting the wound from infection; c. Removing slough; d. Maintaining the optimum pH and temperature to encourage healing. [003] Occlusive dressings, made from substances impervious to moisture such as plastic or latex, can be used to increase the rate of absorption of certain topical medications into the skin. Thus the use of bandages can promote wound healing, however bandages are often ineffective when applied to irregular surfaces or surfaces that can move or stretch, such as the skin surrounding a joint. [004] Biologic tissues and ceils, microbes, bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other organisms or organic matter can be affected by electrical stimulus. Accordingly, apparatus and techniques for applying electric stimulus to organic matter have been developed to address a number of medical issues. These apparatus and techniques can include methods, devices, and systems for treating wounds, including the use of adjunctive wound therapies, such as Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT), Topical Oxygen Therapy (TOT), Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (ΗΒΟΤ), or Multi-Layer Compression Therapy (MLCT). SUMMARY [005] Aspects disclosed herein comprise bioelectric devices that comprise a multi-array matrix of biocompatible microceils.

In embodiments the watt-density of the system can be modulated. [025] Further disclosure relating to the use of electrical current to heal wounds can be found in U.S. Patent No. 7,457,667 entitled CURRENT PRODUCING SURFACE FOR A WOUND DRESSING issued November 25, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. [026] Embodiments disclosed herein comprise biocompatible electrodes or reservoirs or dots on a surface, for example a fabric or the like. In embodiments the surface can be pliable, in embodiments the surface can comprise a gauze or mesh. Suitable types of pliable surfaces for use in embodiments disclosed herein can be absorbent textiles, low-adhesives, vapor permeable films, hydrocoiioids, hydrogels, alginates, foams, foam-based materials, cellulose-based materials including Kettenbach fibers, hollow tubes, fibrous materials, such as those impregnated with anhydrous / hygroscopic materials, beads and the like, or any suitable material as known in the art. In embodiments the pliable material can form, for example, a bandage, a wrist band, a neck band, a waist band, a wound dressing, cloth, fabric, or the like. Embodiments can include coatings on the surface, such as, for example, over or between the electrodes. Such coatings can include, for example, silicone, and electrolytic mixture, hypoallergenic agents, drugs, biologies, stem ceils, skin substitutes or the like. Drugs suitable for use with embodiments of the invention include analgesics, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, or the like. In embodiments the electric field or current produced can “drive” the drug through the skin or surface tissue. [027] In embodiments the material can include a port to access the interior of the material, for example to add fluid, gel, or some other material to the dressing. Certain embodiments can comprise a “blister” top that can enclose a material. In embodiments the blister top can contain a material that is released into the dressing when the blister is pressed, for example a liquid. [028] In embodiments the system comprises a component such as elastic to maintain or help maintain its position. In embodiments the system comprises a component such as an adhesive to maintain or help maintain its position. The adhesive component can be covered with a protective layer that is removed to expose the adhesive at the time of use. in embodiments the adhesive can comprise, for example, sealants, such as hypoallergenic sealants, gecko sealants, mussel sealants, waterproof sealants such as epoxies, and the like. [029] In embodiments the positioning component can comprise an elastic film with an elasticity, for example, similar to that of skin, or greater than that of skin, or less than that of skin. In embodiments, the LLMC or LIEF system can comprise a laminate where layers of the laminate can be of varying elasticities. For example, an outer layer may be highly elastic and an inner layer less-elastic. The less-elastic layer can be made to stretch by placing stress relieving discontinuous regions or slits through the thickness of the material so there is a mechanical displacement rather than stress that would break the fabric weave before stretching would occur, in embodiments the slits can extend completely through a layer or the system or can be placed where expansion is required. In embodiments of the system the slits do not extend all the way through the system or a portion of the system such as the dressing material, in embodiments the discontinuous regions can pass halfway through the long axis of the wound management system. [030] In certain embodiments the surface can comprise the surface of, for example, a catheter, or a microparticle. Such embodiments can be used to treat a subject internally both locally or systemically. For example, the microparticles can be used to make a pharmaceutical composition in combination with a suitable carrier, in embodiments nanotechnology such as nanobots can be used to provide LLIViC systems that can be used as components of pharmaceutical formulations, such as injected, inhaled, or orally administered formulations. [031] “Activation gel” as used herein means a composition useful for maintaining a moist environment about the wound or promoting healing within and about the wound. [032] “Adjunctive therapies” as used herein means therapies used in combination with a wound healing device disclosed herein. Such therapies can include, for example, NPW'T, ΗΒΟΤ, TOT, MLCT, or other therapies useful in wound healing. [033] “Affixing” as used herein can mean contacting a patient or tissue with a device or system disclosed herein. [034] “Applied” or “apply” as used herein refers to contacting a surface with a conductive material, for example printing, painting, or spraying a conductive ink on a surface. Alternatively, “applying” can mean contacting a patient or tissue or organism with a device or system disclosed herein. [035] “Conductive material” as used herein refers to an object or type of material which permits the flow of electric charges in one or more directions. Conductive materials can include solids such as metals or carbon, or liquids such as conductive metal solutions and conductive gels. Conductive materials can be applied to form at least one matrix. Conductive liquids can dry, cure, or harden after application to form a solid material. [036] “Discontinuous region” as used herein refers to a “void” in a materia! such as a hole, slot, or the like. The term can mean any void in the materia! though typically the void is of a regular shape. The void in the material can be entirely within the perimeter of a materia! or it can extend to the perimeter of a material. [037] “Dots” as used herein refers to discrete deposits of dissimilar reservoirs that can function as at least one battery cell. The term can refer to a deposit of any suitable size or shape, such as squares, circles, triangles, lines, etc. The term can be used synonymously with, microcelis, etc. [038] “Electrode” refers to similar or dissimilar conductive materials, in embodiments utilizing an external power source the electrodes can comprise similar conductive materials. In embodiments that do not use an external power source, the electrodes can comprise dissimilar conductive materials that can define an anode and a cathode. [039] “Expandable" as used herein refers to the ability to stretch while retaining structural integrity and not tearing. The term can refer to solid regions as well as discontinuous or void regions; solid regions as well as void regions can stretch or expand. [040] “Galvanic ceil” as used herein refers to an electrochemical cell with a positive ceil potential, which can allow chemical energy to be converted into electrical energy. More particularly, a galvanic ceil can include a first reservoir serving as an anode and a second, dissimilar reservoir serving as a cathode. Each galvanic cell can store chemical potential energy. When a conductive material is located proximate to a cell such that the material can provide electrical and/or ionic communication between the ceil elements the chemical potential energy can be released as electrical energy. Accordingly, each set of adjacent, dissimilar reservoirs can function as a single-cell battery, and the distribution of multiple sets of adjacent, dissimilar reservoirs within the apparatus can function as a field of single-cell batteries, which in the aggregate forms a multiple-cell battery distributed across a surface, in embodiments utilizing an external power source the galvanic ceil can comprise electrodes connected to an external power source, for example a battery or other power source. In embodiments that are externally-powered, the electrodes need not comprise dissimilar materials, as the external power source can define the anode and cathode. In certain externally powered embodiments, the power source need not be physically connected to the device. [041] "Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy” (ΗΒΟΤ) Is the medical use of oxygen at a level higher than atmospheric pressure. Typically the equipment used to perform the procedure consists of a pressure chamber which may be of rigid or flexible construction and a means of delivering up to 100% oxygen. Operation is performed to a predetermined schedule by trained personnel who monitor the patient and can adjust the schedule as required. ΗΒΟΤ found early use in the treatment of decompression sickness, and has also shown great effectiveness in treating conditions such as gas gangrene and carbon monoxide poisoning. More recent research has examined the possibility that It may also have value for other conditions such as cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis, but no significant evidence has been found. [042] “Matrix” or "matrices” as used herein refer to a pattern or patterns, such as those formed by electrodes on a surface. Matrices can be designed to vary the electric field or electric microcurrent generated. For example, the strength and shape of the field or microcurrent can be altered, or the matrices can be designed to produce an electric field(s) or current of a desired strength or shape. [043] “Multi-layered compression therapy” (“IVILCT”) as used herein refers to compression treatment of leg ulcers and other wounds using layers comprised of material with different elastic properties. [044] “Negative-pressure wound therapy” (NPWT) is a therapeutic technique using a vacuum dressing to promote healing in acute or chronic wounds and enhance healing of first and second degree bums. The therapy involves the controlled application of sub-atmospheric pressure to the local wound environment using a sealed wound dressing connected to a vacuum pump. NPWT promotes wound healing by applying a vacuum through a special sealed dressing. The continued vacuum draws out fluid from the wound and increases biood flow to the area. The vacuum can be applied continuously or intermittentiy, depending on the type of wound being treated and the clinical objectives. Typically, the dressing is changed two to three times per week. NPWT devices can allow delivery of fluids, such as saline or antibiotics to irrigate the wound, intermittent removal of used fluid supports the cleaning and drainage of the wound bed. General technique for NPWT is as foliows: a dressing or filler material is fitted to the contours of a wound (which is covered with a nonadherent dressing film) and the overlying foam is then sealed with a transparent film. A drainage tube is connected to the dressing through an opening of the transparent film. A vacuum tube is connected through an opening in the film drape to a canister on the side of a vacuum pump or vacuum source, turning an open wound into a controlled closed wound while removing excess fluid from the wound bed to enhance circulation and remove wound fluids. This creates a moist healing environment and reduces edema. [045] “Reduction-oxidation reaction” or “redox reaction” as used herein refers to a reaction involving the transfer of one or more electrons from a reducing agent to an oxidizing agent. The term "reducing agent" can be defined in some embodiments as a reactant in a redox reaction, which donates electrons to a reduced species. A "reducing agent" is thereby oxidized in the reaction. The term "oxidizing agent" can be defined in some embodiments as a reactant in a redox reaction, which accepts electrons from the oxidized species. An "oxidizing agent" is thereby reduced in the reaction. In various embodiments a redox reaction produced between a first and second reservoir provides a current between the dissimilar reservoirs. The redox reactions can occur spontaneously when a conductive material is brought in proximity to first and second dissimilar reservoirs such that the conductive material provides a medium for electrical communication and/or ionic communication between the first and second dissimilar reservoirs. In other words, in an embodiment electrical currents can be produced between first and second dissimilar reservoirs without the use of an external battery or other power source (e.g., a direct current (DC) such as a battery or an alternating current (AC) power source such as a typical electric outlet). Accordingly, in various embodiments a system is provided which is "electrically self contained," and yet the system can be activated to produce electrical currents. The term "electrically seif contained" can be defined in some embodiments as being capable of producing electricity (e.g... producing currents) without an external battery or power source. The term “activated” can be defined in some embodiments to refer to the production of electric current through the application of a radio signal of a given frequency or through ultrasound or through electromagnetic induction, in other embodiments, a system can be provided which includes an external battery or power source. For example, an AC power source can be of any wave form, such as a sine wave, a triangular wave, or a square wave. AC power can also be of any frequency such as for example 50 Hz or 60 HZ, or the like. AC power can also be of any voltage, such as for example 120 volts, or 220 volts, or the like. In embodiments an AC power source can be electronically modified, such as for example having the voltage reduced, prior to use. [046] “Skin substitute” as used herein refers to a heterogeneous group of wound coverage materials that aid in would closure and replace the functions of the skin, either temporarily or permanently, depending on the product characteristics. These substances are alternatives to the standard wound coverage in circumstances when standard therapies are not desirable. [047] “Stretchable" as used herein refers to the ability of embodiments that stretch without losing their structural integrity. That is, embodiments can stretch to accommodate irregular wound surfaces or surfaces wherein one portion of the surface can move relative to another portion of the surface. [048] “Topical oxygen therapy” or “TOT” refers to the direct application of oxygen to wounds. [049] “Wound” as used herein includes abrasions, surgical incisions, cuts, punctures, tears, sores, ulcers, blisters, burns, amputations, bites, and any other breach or disruption of superficial tissue such as the skin, mucus membranes, epithelial linings, etc. Disruptions can include inflamed areas, polyps, ulcers, etc. A scar Is intended to include hypertrophic scars, keloids, or any healed wound tissue of the afflicted Individual. Superficial tissues include those tissues not normally exposed in the absence of a wound or disruption, such as underlying muscle or connective tissue. A wound is not necessarily visible nor does it necessarily involve rupture of superficial tissue, for example a wound can comprise a bacterial infection. Wounds can include insect and animal bites from both venomous and non-venomous insects and animals. [050] LLMC / LLEF Systems- Methods of Manufacture [051] A LLMC or LLEF system disclosed herein can comprise “anchor” regions or “arms” to affix the system securely. The anchor regions or arms can anchor the LLMC system, such as for example to areas around a joint where motion is minimal or limited. For example, a LLMC system can be secured to a wound proximal to a joint, and the anchor regions of the system can extend to areas of minimal stress or movement to securely affix the system. Further, the LLMC system can reduce stress on the wound site by “countering" the physical stress caused by movement. For example, the wound management system can be pre-stressed or stretched prior to application such that it “pulls” or “holds” the wound perimeter together. [052] A LLMC or LIEF system disclosed herein can comprise reinforcing sections. In embodiments the reinforcing sections can comprise sections that span the length of the system. In embodiments a LLMC or LLEF system can comprise multiple reinforcing sections such as at least 1 reinforcing section, at least 2 reinforcing sections, at least 3 reinforcing sections, at least 4 reinforcing sections, at least 5 reinforcing sections, at least 6 reinforcing sections, or the like. [053] in embodiments the LLMC or LLEF system can comprise additional materials to aid in healing. These additional materials can comprise activation gels, rhPDGF (recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor) (REGRANEX®), VibronectimIGF complexes, CELLSPRAY (Clinical Cell Culture Pty. Ltd., Australia), RECELL® (Clinical Cell Culture Pty. Ltd., Australia), INTEGRA® dermal regeneration template (Integra Life Sciences, U.S.), BiOMEND® (Zimmer Dental Inc., U.S.), INFUSE® (Medtronic Sofamor Danek Inc., U.S.), ALLODERM® (LifeCeli Corp. U.S.), CYMETRA® (LifeCell Corp. U.S.), SEPRAPACK® (Genzyme Corporation, U.S.), SEPRAMESH® (Genzyme Corporation, U.S.), SKINTEMP® (Human BioSciences Inc., U.S.), COSMODERM® (Inamed Corporation, U.S.), COSMOPLAST® (inamed Corporation, U.S.), OP-1® (Stryker Corporation, U.S.), ISOLAGEN® (Fibroceli Technologies Inc., U.S.), CARTICEL® (Genzyme Corporation, U.S.), APLIGRAF® (Sandoz AG Corporation, Switzerland), DERMAGRAFT® (Smith & Nephew Wound Management Corporation, U.S.), TRANSCYTE® (Shire Regenerative Medicine Inc., U.S.), ORCEL® (Orcell LLPC Corporation, U.S.), EPICEL® (Genzyme Corporation, U.S.), and the like. In embodiments the additional materials can be, for example, TEGADERM® 91110 (3Μ Corporation, U.S.), MEPILEX® Normal Gel 0,9% Sodium chloride (Moinlycke Health Care ΑΒ, Sweden), HISPAGEL® (BASF Corporation, U.S.), LUBRIGEL® (Sheffield Laboratories Corporation, U.S.) or other compositions useful for maintaining a moist environment about a wound or for ease of removal of the LLMC or LLEF system. In certain embodiments additional materials that can be added to the LLMC or LLEF system can Include for example, vesicular-based formulations such as hemoglobin vesicles, in certain embodiments liposome-based formulations can be used. [054] A wound management system can comprise a wound dressing such as a bandage, for example a gauze bandage. The most common type of bandage is the gauze bandage, a simple woven strip of material (typically prepared from type 1 absorbent gauze), or a woven strip of material with a TELFA™ absorbent barrier to prevent adhering to wounds which can come in any number of widths and lengths. [055] A wound management system can comprise a compression bandage, for example a short stretch compression bandage, a long stretch compression bandage, or the like. Short stretch compression bandages are typically applied to a limb (usually for treatment of lymphedema or venous ulcers). This type of bandage is capable of shortening around the limb after application and is therefore not exerting ever-increasing pressure during inactivity. This dynamic is called resting pressure and is considered safe and comfortable for iong-term treatment. Conversely, the stability of the bandage creates a very high resistance to stretch when pressure is applied through internal muscle contraction and joint movement. This force is called working pressure. Long stretch compression bandages usually have long stretch properties meaning their high compressive power can be easily adjusted. However, they also have a very high resting pressure and must be removed at night or if the patient is in a resting position. [056] A wound management system described herein can comprise areas of greater and lesser relative strength. In certain embodiments the mechanical properties of the wound management system can strengthen, weaken, or release over time or in response to changes in environmental conditions such as humidity, pressure, or temperature. For example, in embodiments a wound management system disclosed herein can shrink or expand when exposed to a warmed or humid surface, such as for example a body surface. Embodiments can include natural or synthetic longchain polymers such as silk, cellulose, or collagen, that can shrink or expand when exposed to a warmed or humid surface such as skin or a wound site. [057] Embodiments of the wound management system can improve wound healing by, for example, protecting the wound, maintaining a moist environment in and about the wound, absorbing excess moisture, reducing physical stress on a wound axis such as an incision line, expand and contract as a wound or the area about a wound moves through a range of motion, such as for example, during motion therapy such as Continuous Passive Motion (CRM) therapy or other forms of rehabilitation, provide ease of wound management system application, provide ease of wound management system removal, and the like. [058] in embodiments the wound management system comprises a component such as an adhesive to maintain or help maintain its position. The adhesive component can be covered with a protective layer that is removed to expose the adhesive at the time of use. in embodiments the positioning component can comprise an elastic film with an elasticity, for example, similar to that of skin, or greater than that of skin, or less than that of skin. In embodiments, the wound management system can comprise a laminate where layers of the laminate can be of varying elasticities. For example, an outer layer may be highly elastic and an inner layers in-elastic. The in-elastic layer can be made to stretch by placing stress relieving discontinuous regions or slits through the thickness of the material so there is a mechanical displacement rather than stresses that would break the fabric weave before stretching would occur. In embodiments the slits can extend completely through a layer or the system or can be placed where expansion is required. In embodiments of the system the slits do not extend ail the way through the system or a portion of the system such as the dressing material, in embodiments the discontinuous regions can pass halfway through the long axis of the wound management system. [059] A wound management system disclosed herein can include a discontinuous region. The discontinuous region can comprise any void in the material though typically the void Is of a regular shape. Embodiments can comprise, for example, at least 2 discontinuous regions, or at least 3 discontinuous regions, or at least 4 discontinuous regions, or at least 5 discontinuous regions, or at least 6 discontinuous regions, or at least 7 discontinuous regions, or at least 8 discontinuous regions, or at least 9 discontinuous regions, or at least 10 discontinuous regions, or at least 11 discontinuous regions, or at least 12 discontinuous regions, or at least 13 discontinuous regions, or at least 14 discontinuous regions, or at least 15 discontinuous regions, or at least 16 discontinuous regions, or at least 17 discontinuous regions, or at least 18 discontinuous regions, or at least 19 discontinuous regions, or at least 20 discontinuous regions. [060] Typical shapes of the discontinuous region can be a circle, a square, a triangle, a rectangle, a pentagon, a hexagon, an octagon, a decagon, a nonagon, a trapezoid, a parallelogram, a rhombus, a heptagon, a star, a crescent, an oval, a semicircle, or the like. In aspects of this embodiment, a discontinuous region can comprise, for example, a slit, a slot, or the like. In embodiments a wound management system can comprise 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more silts.

The anchor regions or arms can anchor the wound management system in areas where stress is limited, such as for example in areas around a joint where motion is minimal or limited. For example, a wound management system can be secured to a wound proximal to a joint, and the anchor regions of the system can extend to areas of minimal stress or movement to securely affix the system. Further, the wound management system can reduce stress on the wound site by "countering” the physical stress caused by movement. For example, the wound management system can be pre-stressed or stretched prior to application such that it “pulls” or “holds” the wound perimeter together. [062] These regions can comprise elongated areas of pliable cover material that can be used to affix the wound dressing to the wound site. The anchor regions can comprise means for affixing the wound dressing, for example adhesive, hook and loop material, or the like. The pliable cover material can be expandable, in embodiments, a wound management system can comprise multiple anchor regions such as at least 1 anchor region, or at least 2 anchor regions, or at least 3 anchor regions, or at least 4 anchor regions, or at least 5 anchor regions, or at least 6 anchor regions, or at least 7 anchor regions, or at least 8 anchor regions, or at least 9 anchor regions, or at least 10 anchor regions, or at least 11 anchor regions, or at least 12 anchor regions, or at least 13 anchor regions, or at least 14 anchor regions, or at least 15 anchor regions, or at least 16 anchor regions, or at least 17 anchor regions, or at least 18 anchor regions, or at least 19 anchor regions, or more anchor regions or the like. [063] A wound management system disclosed herein can comprise reinforcing sections, in embodiments the reinforcing sections can comprise sections that span the length of the system. In embodiments a wound management system can comprise multiple reinforcing sections such as at least 1 reinforcing section, or at least 2 reinforcing sections, or at least 3 reinforcing sections, or at least 4 reinforcing sections, or at least 5 reinforcing sections, or at least 6 reinforcing sections, or at least 7 reinforcing sections, or at least 8 reinforcing sections, or at least 9 reinforcing sections, or at least 10 reinforcing sections, or at least 11 reinforcing sections, or at ieast 12 reinforcing sections, or at least 13 reinforcing sections, or at least 14 reinforcing sections, or at least 15 reinforcing sections, or at least 16 reinforcing sections, or at least 17 reinforcing sections, or at ieast 18 reinforcing sections, or at ieast 19 reinforcing sections, or more reinforcing sections or the iike. [064] Discontinuous regions can be utilized in multiple parts of the wound management system, for example, the wound dressing itself can comprise discontinuous regions in a pliable dressing material, a pliable cover material, anchor regions, reinforcing sections, and the like, [065] in embodiments, the wound management system can comprise instructions or directions on how to piace the system to maximize Its ability to expand or contract in response to physical stress. For example, the wound management system can comprise instructional materials or indicators such as lines or arrows upon the pliable cover material to identify the axis or axes upon which it is stretchable. [066] Embodiments of LLMC or LIEF systems disclosed herein can comprise electrodes or microcelis. Each electrode or microceli can be or include a conductive metal, in embodiments, the electrodes or microcells can comprise any electricaliy-conductive material, for example, an electrically conductive hydrogel, metals, electrolytes, superconductors, semiconductors, plasmas, and nonmetallic conductors such as graphite and conductive polymers. Electrically conductive metals can include silver, copper, gold, aluminum, molybdenum, zinc, lithium, tungsten, brass, carbon, nickel, iron, palladium, platinum, tin, bronze, carbon steel, lead, titanium, stainless steel, mercury, Fe/Cr alloys, and the like. The electrode can be coated or plated with a different metal such as aluminum, gold, platinum or silver. [067] In certain embodiments reservoir or electrode geometry can comprise circles, polygons, lines, zigzags, ovals, stars, or any suitable variety of shapes. This provides the ability to design/customize surface electric field shapes as well as depth of penetration. [068] Reservoir or dot sizes and concentrations can be of various sizes, as these variations can allow for changes in the properties of the electric field created by embodiments of the invention. Certain embodiments provide an eiectric field at about 1 Volt and then, under normal tissue loads with resistance of 100k to 300Κ ohms, produce a current in the range of 10 microamperes. The electric field strength can be determined by calculating 14 the separation distance and applying it in the z-axis over the midpoint between the cell. This indicates the theoretical location of the highest strength field line. [069] in certain embodiments dissimilar metals can be used to create an electric field with a desired voltage. In certain embodiments the pattern of reservoirs can control the watt density and shape of the electric field. [079] in embodiments “ink” or “paint” can comprise any conductive solution suitable for forming an electrode on a surface, such as a conductive metal solution. In embodiments “printing” or “painted” can comprise any method of applying a conductive material such as a conductive liquid material to a material upon which a matrix is desired. [071] in embodiments printing devices can be used to produce LLMC or LIEF systems disclosed herein. For example, inkjet or “3D” printers can be used to produce embodiments. [072] in certain embodiments the binders or inks used to produce LLMC or LLEF systems disclosed herein can include, for example, poly cellulose inks, poly acrylic inks, poly urethane inks, silicone inks, and the like, in embodiments the type of ink used can determine the release rate of electrons from the reservoirs. In embodiments various materials can be added to the ink or binder such as, for example, conductive or resistive materials can be added to alter the shape or strength of the electric field. Other materials, such as silicon, can be added to enhance scar reduction. Such materials can also be added to the spaces between reservoirs. [073] Certain embodiments can utilize a power source to create the electric current, such as a battery or a microbattery. The power source can be any energy source capable of generating a current in the LLMC system and can include, for example, AC power, DC power, radio frequencies (RF) such as pulsed RF, Induction, ultrasound, and the like. [074] Dissimilar metals used to make a LLMC or LLEF system disclosed herein can be silver and zinc, and the electrolytic solution can include sodium chloride in water, in certain embodiments the electrodes are applied onto a non-conductive surface to create a pattern, most preferably an array or multi-array of voltaic cells that do not spontaneously react until they contact an electrolytic solution, for example wound fluid. Sections of this description use the terms "printing" with “ink," but it is understood that the patterns may instead be "painted" with "paints.” The use of any suitable means for applying a conductive material is contemplated. In embodiments “ink” or “paint” can comprise any solution suitable for forming an electrode on a surface such as a conductive material including a conductive metal solution, in embodiments “printing” or “painted” can comprise any method of applying a solution to a material upon which a matrix is desired. It is also assumed that a competent practitioner knows how to properly apply and cure the solutions without any assistance, other than perhaps instructions that should be included with the selected binder that is used to make the mixtures that will be used in the printing process. [075] A preferred material to use in combination with silver to create the voltaic cells or reservoirs of disclosed embodiments is zinc. Zinc has been well-described for its uses in prevention of infection in such topical antibacterial agents as Bacitracin zinc, a zinc salt of Bacitracin. Zinc is a divalent cation with antibacterial properties of its own in addition to possessing the added benefit of being a cofactor to proteins of the metalloproteinase family of enzymes important to the phagocytic debridement and remodeling phases of wound healing. As a cofactor zinc promotes and accelerates the functional activity of these enzymes, resulting in better more efficient wound healing. [076] Turning to the figures, in FIG. 1, the dissimilar electrodes first electrode 6 and second electrode 10 are applied onto a desired primary surface 2 of an article 4. In one embodiment primary surface is a surface of a LLMC or LLEF system that comes into direct contact with an area to be treated such as skin surface or a wound. In alternate embodiments primary surface 2 is one which is desired to be antimicrobial, such as a medical instrument, implant, surgical gown, gloves, socks, table, door knob, or other surface that will contact an electrolytic solution including sweat, so that at least part of the pattern of voltaic ceils will spontaneously react and kill bacteria or other microbes. [077] In various embodiments the difference of the standard potentials of the electrodes or dots or reservoirs can be in a range from 0.05 V to approximately 5.0 V. For example, the standard potential can be 0.05 V, 0.06 V, 0.07 V, 0.08 V, 0.09 V, 0.1 V, 0.2 V, 0.3 V, 0.4 V, 0.5 V, 0.6 V, 0.7 V, 0,8 V, 0.9 V, 1.0 V, 1.1 V, 1.2 V, 1.3 V, 1.4 V, 1.5 V, 1.6 V, 1.7 V, 1.8 V, 1.9 V, 2,0 V, 2.1 V, 2.2 V, 2.3 V, 2.4 V, 2.5 V, 2.6 V, 2.7 V, 2.8 V, 2.9 V, 3.0 V, 3.1 V, 3.2 V, 3.3 V, 3.4 V, 3.5 V, 3.6 V, 3.7 V, 3.8 V, 3.9 V, 4.0 V, 4,1 V, 4,2 V, 4,3 V, 4,4 V, 4,5 V, 4,6 V, 4,7 V, 4,8 V, 4,9 V, 5.0 V, 5.1 V, 5.2 V, 5.3 V, 5.4 V, 5.5 V, 5.6 V, 5.7 V, 5.8 V, 5.9 V, 6.0 V, or the like.

[084] in embodiments, LLMC systems of the invention can produce a low level micro-current of not less than 10 micro-amperes, not less than 20 micro-amperes, not less than 30 micro-amperes, not less than 40 micro-amperes, not less than 50 micro-amperes, not less than 60 micro-amperes, not less than 70 micro-amperes, not less than 80 micro-amperes, not less than 90 micro-amperes, not less than 100 micro-amperes, not less than 110 micro-amperes, not less than 120 micro-amperes, not less than 130 micro-amperes, not less than 140 micro-amperes, not less than 150 micro-amperes, not less than 160 micro-amperes, not less than 170 micro-amperes, not less than 180 micro-amperes, not less than 190 micro-amperes, not less than 200 micro-amperes, not less than 210 micro-amperes, not less than 220 micro-amperes, not less than 230 micro-amperes, not less than 240 micro-amperes, not less than 250 micro-amperes, not less than 260 micro-amperes, not less than 270 micro-amperes, not less than 280 micro-amperes, not less than 290 micro-amperes, not less than 300 micro-amperes, not less than 310 micro-amperes, not less than 320 micro-amperes, not less than 330 micro-amperes, not less than 340 micro-amperes, not less than 350 micro-amperes, not less than 360 micro-amperes, not less than 370 micro-amperes, not less than 380 micro-amperes, not less than 390 micro-amperes, not less than 400 micro-amperes, or the like. [085] The applied electrodes or reservoirs or dots can adhere or bond to the primary surface 2 because a biocompatible binder is mixed, in embodiments into separate mixtures, with each of the dissimilar metals that will create the pattern of voltaic cells, in embodiments. Most inks are simply a carrier, and a binder mixed with pigment. Similarly, conductive metal solutions can be a binder mixed with a conductive element. The resulting conductive metal solutions can be used with an application method such as screen printing to apply the electrodes to the primary surface in predetermined patterns. Once the conductive metal solutions dry and/or cure, the patterns of spaced electrodes can substantially maintain their relative position, even on a flexible material such as that used for a LLMC or LIEF system. To make a limited number of the systems of an embodiment disclosed herein, the conductive metal solutions can be hand applied onto a common adhesive bandage so that there is an array of alternating electrodes that are spaced about a millimeter apart on the primary surface of the bandage. The solution should be allowed to dry before being applied to a surface so that the conductive materials do not mix, which would destroy the array and cause direct reactions that will release the elements, but fail to simulate the current of injury. However, the wound management system would still exhibit an antimicrobial effect even if the materials were mixed. Furthermore, though silver alone will demonstrate antimicrobial effects, embodiments of the invention show antimicrobial activity greater than that of silver alone. [086] in certain embodiments that utilize a poly-cellulose binder, the binder itself can have an beneficial effect such as reducing the local concentration of matrix metaNo-proteases through an iontophoretic process that drives the cellulose into the surrounding tissue. This process can be used to electronically drive other components such as drugs into the surrounding tissue. [087] The binder can include any hiocompatible liquid material that can be mixed with a conductive element (preferably metallic crystals of silver or zinc) to create a conductive solution which can be applied as a thin coating to a surface. One suitable binder is a solvent reducible polymer, such as the polyacrylic non-toxic silk-screen ink manufactured by COLORCON® Inc., a division of Berwind Pharmaceutical Services, Inc, (see COLORCON® NO-TOX® product line, part number ΝΤ28). In an embodiment the binder is mixed with high purity (at least 99.999%) metallic silver crystals to make the silver conductive solution. The silver crystals, which can be made by grinding silver into a powder, are preferably smaller than 100 microns in size or about as fine as flour. In an embodiment, the size of the crystals is about 325 mesh, which is typically about 40 microns in size or a little smaller. The binder is separately mixed with high purity (at least 99.99%, in an embodiment) metallic zinc powder which has also preferably been sifted through standard 325 mesh screen, to make the zinc conductive solution. For better quality control and more consistent results, most of the crystals used should be larger than 325 mesh and smaller than 200 mesh. For example the crystals used should be between 200 mesh and 325 mesh, or between 210 mesh and 310 mesh, between 220 mesh and 300 mesh, between 230 mesh and 290 mesh, between 240 mesh and 280 mesh, between 250 mesh and 270 mesh, between 255 mesh and 265 mesh, or the like. [088] Other powders of metal can be used to make other conductive metal solutions in the same way as described in other embodiments. [089] The size of the metai crystals, the availability of the surface to the conductive fluid and the ratio of metal to binder affects the release rate of the metal from the mixture. When COLORCON® polyacrylic Ink Is used as the binder, about 10 to 40 percent of the mixture should be metal for a longer term bandage (for example, one that stays on for about 10 days). For example, for a longer term LLMC or LIEF system the percent of the mixture that should be metal can be 8 percent, or 10 percent, 12 percent, 14 percent, 16 percent, 18 percent, 20 percent, 22 percent, 24 percent, 26 percent, 28 percent, 30 percent, 32 percent, 34 percent, 36 percent, 38 percent, 40 percent, 42 percent, 44 percent, 46 percent, 48 percent, 50 percent, or the like. [090] If the same binder is used, but the percentage of the mixture that is metai is increased to 60 percent or higher, then the release rate will be much faster and a typical system will only be effective for a few days. For example, for a shorter term bandage, the percent of the mixture that should be metal can be 40 percent, or 42 percent, 44 percent, 46 percent, 48 percent, 50 percent, 52 percent, 54 percent, 56 percent, 58 percent, 60 percent, 62 percent, 64 percent, 66 percent, 68 percent, 70 percent, 72 percent, 74 percent, 76 percent, 78 percent, 80 percent, 82 percent, 84 percent, 86 percent, 88 percent, 90 percent, or the like. [091] it should be noted that poiyacryilc ink can crack if applied as a very thin coat, which exposes more metai crystals which will spontaneously react. For LLMC or LLEF systems comprising an article of clothing it may be desired to decrease the percentage of metal down to 5 percent or less, or to use a binder that causes the crystals to be more deeply embedded, so that the primary surface will be antimicrobial for a very long period of time and will not wear prematurely. Other binders can dissolve or otherwise break down faster or slower than a polyacrylic ink, so adjustments can be made to achieve the desired rate of spontaneous reactions from the voltaic cells. [092] To maximize the number of voltaic cells, in various embodiments, a pattern of alternating sliver masses or electrodes or reservoirs and zinc masses or electrodes or reservoirs can create an array of electrical currents across the primary surface. A basic pattern, shown in FIG. 1, has each mass of silver equally spaced from four masses of zinc, and has each mass of zinc equally spaced from four masses of silver, according to an embodiment. The first electrode 6 is separated from the second electrode 10 by a spacing 8. The designs of first electrode 6 and second electrode 10 are simply round dots, and in an embodiment, are repeated. Numerous repetitions 12 of the designs result in a pattern. For a wound management system or dressing, each silver design preferably has about twice as much mass as each zinc design, in an embodiment. For the pattern in FIG. 1, the silver designs are most preferably about a millimeter from each of the closest four zinc designs, and vice-versa. The resulting pattern of dissimilar metal masses defines an array of voltaic ceils when introduced to an electrolytic solution. Further disclosure relating to methods of producing microarrays can be found in U.S. Patent No. 7,813,806 entitled CURRENT PRODUCING SURFACE FOR TREATING BIOLOGIC TISSUE issued October 12, 2010, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. [093] A dot pattern of masses like the alternating round dots of FIG. 1 can be preferred when applying conductive material onto a flexible material, such as those used for a wound dressing, because the dots won't significantly affect the flexibility of the material. The pattern of FIG. 1 is well suited for general use. To maximize the density of electrical current over a primary surface the pattern of FIG. 2 can be used. The first electrode 6 in FIG. 2 is a large hexagonally shaped dot, and the second electrode 10 is a pair of smaller hexagonally shaped dots that are spaced from each other. The spacing 8 that is between the first electrode 6 and the second electrode 10 maintains a relatively consistent distance between adjacent sides of the designs. Numerous repetitions 12 of the designs result in a pattern 14 that can be described as at least one of the first design being surrounded by six hexagonally shaped dots of the second design. The pattern of FIG. 2 is well suited for abrasions and burns, as well as for insect bites, including those that can transfer bacteria or microbes or other organisms from the insect. There are of course other patterns that could be printed to achieve similar results. [094] FIGS. 3 and 4 show how the pattern of FIG. 2 can be used to make an adhesive bandage. The pattern shown in detail in FIG. 2 is applied to the primary surface 2 of a wound dressing material. The back 20 of the printed dressing material is fixed to an absorbent wound dressing layer 22 such as cotton. The absorbent dressing layer is adhesively fixed to an elastic adhesive layer 16 such that there is at least one overlapping piece or anchor 18 of the elastic adhesive layer that can be used to secure the wound management system over a wound. [095] FIG. 5 shows an additional feature, which can be added between designs, that will start the flow of current in a poor electrolytic solution, A fine line 24 is printed using one of the conductive metal solutions along a current path of each voltaic ceil. The fine line will initially have a direct reaction hut will be depleted until the distance between the electrodes increases to where maximum voltage is realized. The initial current produced Is intended to help control edema so that the LLMC system will be effective. If the electrolytic solution is highly conductive when the system is initially applied the fine line can be quickly depleted and the wound dressing will function as though the fine line had never existed. [098] FIGS. 6 and 7 show alternative patterns that use at least one line design. The first electrode 6 of FIG. 6 is a round dot similar to the first design used in FIG. 1. The second electrode 10 of FIG. 6 is a line. When the designs are repeated, they define a pattern of parallel lines that are separated by numerous spaced dots, FIG. 7 uses only line designs. The pattern of FIG. 7 is well suited for cuts, especially when the lines are perpendicular to a cut. The first electrode 6 can be thicker or wider than the second electrode 10 if the oxidation-reduction reaction requires more metal from the first conductive element (mixed into the first design's conductive metal solution) than the second conductive element (mixed into the second design's conductive metal solution). The lines can be dashed. Another pattern can be silver grid lines that have zinc masses in the center of each of the ceils of the grid. The pattern can be letters printed from alternating conductive materials so that a message can be printed onto the primary surfaee-perhaps a brand name or identifying information such as patient blood type. [097] Because the spontaneous oxidation-reduction reaction of silver and zinc uses a ratio of approximately two silver to one zinc, the silver design can contain about twice as much mass as the zinc design in an embodiment. At a spacing of about 1 mm between the closest dissimilar metals (closest edge to closest edge) each voltaic cell that is in wound fluid can create approximately 1 volt of potential that will penetrate substantially through the dermis and epidermis. Closer spacing of the dots can decrease the resistance, providing less potential, and the current will not penetrate as deeply. If the spacing fails below about one tenth of a millimeter a benefit of the spontaneous reaction is that which is also present with a direct reaction; silver is electrically driven into the wound, but the current of injury may not be substantially simulated. Therefore, spacing between the closest conductive materials can be 0.1 mm, or 0.2 mm, 0.3 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.6 mm, 0.7 mm, 0.8 mm, 0.9 mm, 1 mm, 1.1 mm, 1.2 mm, 1.3 mm, 1.4 mm, 1.5 mm, 1.6 mm, 1.7 mm, 1.8 mm, 1.9 mm, 2 mm, 2.1 mm, 2.2 mm, 2.3 mm, 2.4 mm, 2,5 mm, 2.6 mm, 2,7 mm, 2.8 mm, 2.9 mm, 3 mm, 3.1 mm, 3.2 mm, 3.3 mm, 3.4 mm, 3.5 mm, 3.6 mm, 3.7 mm, 3.8 mm, 3.9 mm, 4 mm, 4.1 mm, 4.2 mm, 4.3 mm, 4,4 mm, 4.5 mm, 4.6 mm, 4.7 mm, 4.8 mm, 4.9 mm, 5 mm, 5.1 mm, 5.2 mm, 5,3 mm, 5.4 mm, 5.5 mm, 5.6 mm, 5.7 mm, 5.8 mm, 5.9 mm, 6 mm, or the like, [098] In certain embodiments the spacing between the closest conductive materials can be not more than 0.1 mm, or not more than 0.2 mm, not more than 0.3 mm, not more than 0,4 mm, not more than 0.5 mm, not more than 0.6 mm, not more than 0.7 mm, not more than 0.8 mm, not more than 0.9 mm, not more than 1 mm, not more than 1.1 mm, not more than 1.2 mm, not more than 1.3 mm, not more than 1.4 mm, not more than 1.5 mm, not more than 1.6 mm, not more than 1.7 mm, not more than 1.8 mm, not more than 1.9 mm, not more than 2 mm, not more than 2.1 mm, not more than 2.2 mm, not more than 2.3 mm, not more than 2.4 mm, not more than 2.5 mm, not more than 2.6 mm, not more than 2.7 mm, not more than 2.8 mm, not more than 2.9 mm, not more than 3mm, not more than 3,1 mm, not more than 3.2 mm, not more than 3.3 mm, not more than 3.4 mm, not more than 3.5 mm, not more than 3.6 mm, not more than 3.7 mm, not more than 3.8 mm, not more than 3.9 mm, not more than 4 mm, not more than 4.1 mm, not more than 4.2 mm, not more than 4.3 mm, not more than 4.4 mm, not more than 4.5 mm, not more than 4.6 mm, not more than 4.7 mm, not more than 4.8 mm, not more than 4.9 mm, not more than 5 mm, not more than 5.1 mm, not more than 5.2 mm, not more than 5.3 mm, not more than 5.4 mm, not more than 5.5 mm, not more than 5.6 mm, not more than 5.7 mm, not more than 5.8 mm, not more than 5.9 mm, not more than 6 mm, or the like.

For example, the quantities of material within a first and second reservoir can be selected to provide an apparatus having an operational behavior that depletes at approximately a desired rate and/or that "dies" after an approximate period of time after activation. In an embodiment the one or more first reservoirs and the one or more second reservoirs are configured to sustain one or more currents for an approximate ρre-determined period of time, after activation. It is to be understood that the amount of time that currents are sustained can depend on external conditions and factors (e.g., the quantity and type of activation material), and currents can occur intermittently depending on the presence or absence of activation material. Further disclosure relating to producing reservoirs that are configured to sustain one or more currents for an approximate ρre-determined period of time can be found in U.S. Patent No. 7,904,147 entitled SUBSTANTIALLY PLANAR ARTICLE AND METHODS OF MANUFACTURE issued March 8, 2011, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

For example, the standard potential can be 0.05 V, or 0.06 V, 0.07 V, 0.08 V, 0.09 V, 0.1 V, 0.2 V, 0.3 V, 0.4 V, 0.5 V, 0.6 V, 0.7 V, 0.8 V, 0.9 V, 1.0 V, 1.1 V, 1.2 V, 1.3 V, 1.4 V, 1.5 V, 1.6 V, 1.7 V, 1.8 V, 1.9 V, 2.0 V, 2.1 V, 2.2 V, 2.3 V, 2.4 V, 2.5 V, 2.6 V, 2.7 V, 2.8 V, 2.9 V, 3.0 V, 3.1 V, 3.2 V, 3.3 V, 3.4 V, 3.5 V, 3.6 V, 3.7 V, 3.8 V, 3.9 V, 4.0 V, 4.1 V, 4.2 V, 4.3 V, 4.4 V, 4.5 V, 4.6 V, 4.7 V, 4.8 V, 4.9 V, 5.0 V, or the like. [0105] In a particular embodiment the difference of the standard potentials of the first and second reservoirs can be at least 0.05 V, or at least 0.06 V, at least 0.07 V, at least 0.08 V, at least 0.09 V, at least 0.1 V, at least 0.2 V, at least 0.3 V, at least 0.4 V, at least 0.5 V, at least 0.6 V, at least 0.7 V, at least 0.8 V, at least 0.9 V, at least 1.0 V, at least 1.1 V, at least 1.2 V, at least 1.3 V, at least 1.4 V, at least 1.5 V, at least 1.6 V, at least 1.7 V, at least 1.8 V, at least 1.9 V, at least 2.0 V, at least 2.1 V, at least 2,2 V, at least 2.3 V, at least 2.4 V, at least 2.5 V, at least 2,6 V, at least 2.7 V, at least 2.8 V, at least 2,9 V, at least 3.0 V, at least 3.1 V, at least 3.2 V, at least 3.3 V, at least 3.4 V, at least 3.5 V, at least 3.6 V, at least 3.7 V, at least 3.8 V, at least 3.9 V, at least 4.0 V, at least 4.1 V, at least 4.2 V, at least 4.3 V, at least 4.4 V, at least 4,5 V, at least 4.6 V, at least 4.7 V, at least 4.8 V, at least 4.9 V, at least 5.0 V, or the like. [0106] In a particular embodiment, the difference of the standard potentials of the first and second reservoirs can be not more than 0.05 V, or not more than 0.06 V, not more than 0.07 V, not more than 0.08 V, not more than 0.09 V, not more than 0.1 V, not more than 0.2 V, not more than 0.3 V, not more than 0.4 V, not more than 0.5 V, not more than 0.6 V, not more than 0.7 V, not more than 0.8 V, not more than 0.9 V, not more than 1.0 V, not more than 1.1V, not more than 1.2 V, not more than 1.3 V, not more than 1.4 V, not more than 1.5 V, not more than 1.6 V, not more than 1.7 V, not more than 1.8 V, not more than 1.9 V, not more than 2.0 V, not more than 2.1 V, not more than 2.2 V, not more than 2.3 V, not more than 2.4 V, not more than 2.5 V, not more than 2.6 V, not more than 2.7 V, not more than 2.8 V, not more than 2.9 V, not more than 3.0 V, not more than 3.1 V, not more than 3.2 V, not more than 3.3 V, not more than 3.4 V, not more than 3.5 V, not more than 3.6 V, not more than 3.7 V, not more than 3.8 V, not more than 3.9 V, not more than 4.0 V, not more than 4.1 V, not more than 4.2 V, not more than 4.3 V, not more than 4.4 V, not more than 4.5 V, not more than 4.6 V, not more than 4.7 V, not more than 4.8 V. not more than 4.9 V, not more than 5.0 V, or the like. In embodiments that include very small reservoirs (e.g,, on the nanometer scale), the difference of the standard potentials can be substantially less or more.

Further disclosure relating to standard potentials can be found in U.S. Patent No. 8,224,439 entitled BATTERIES AND METHODS OF MANUFACTURE AND USE issued July 17, 2012, which is incorporated be reference herein in its entirety. [0107] The voltage present at the site of treatment is typically in the range of millivolts but disclosed embodiments can introduce a much higher voltage, for example near 1 volt when using the 1 mm spacing of dissimilar metals already described. The higher voltage Is believed to drive the current deeper into the treatment area so that dermis and epidermis benefit from the simulated current of injury. In this way the current not only can drive silver and zinc into the treatment, but the current can also provide a stimulatory current so that the entire surface area can heal simultaneously, in embodiments the current can, for example, kill microbes. [0108] Embodiments disclosed herein relating to treatment of diseases or conditions or symptoms can also comprise selecting a patient or tissue in need of, or that could benefit by, treatment of that disease, condition, or symptom. [0109] While various embodiments have been shown and described, it will be realized that alterations and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the scope of the following claims. For example it can be desirable to use methods other than a common screen printing machine to apply the electrodes onto surfaces on medical Instruments, garments, implants and the like so that they are antimicrobial. It Is expected that other methods of applying the conductive material can be substituted as appropriate. Also, there are numerous shapes, sizes and patterns of voltaic ceils that have not been described but it is expected that this disclosure will enable those skilled in the art to incorporate their own designs which will then be applied to a surface to create voltaic cells which will become active when brought into contact with an electrolytic solution. [0110] Certain embodiments include LLMC or LIEF systems comprising dressings or bandages designed to be used on irregular, non-planar, or "stretching” surfaces such as joints. Embodiments disclosed herein can be used with numerous joints of the body, including the jaw, the shoulder, the elbow, the wrist, the finger joints, the hip, the knee, the ankle, the toe joints, etc. Additional embodiments disclosed herein can be used in areas where tissue is prone to movement, for example the eyelid, the ear, the lips, the nose, genitalia, etc. [0111] Various apparatus embodiments which can be referred to as "medical batteries” are described herein. Further disclosure relating to this technology can be found in U.S. Patent No. 7,672.719 entitled BATTERIES AND METHODS OF MANUFACTURE AND USE issued March 2, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. [0112] Certain embodiments disclosed herein include a method of manufacturing a substantially planar LLMC or LIEF system, the method comprising joining with a substrate multiple first reservoirs wherein selected ones of the multiple first reservoirs include a reducing agent, and wherein first reservoir surfaces of selected ones of the multiple first reservoirs are proximate to a first substrate surface; and joining with the substrate multiple second reservoirs wherein selected ones of the multiple second reservoirs include an oxidizing agent, and wherein second reservoir surfaces of selected ones of the multiple second reservoirs are proximate to the first substrate surface, wherein joining the multiple first reservoirs and joining the multiple second reservoirs comprises joining using tattooing. In embodiments the substrate can comprise gauzes comprising dots or electrodes. [0113] Further embodiments can include a method of manufacturing a LLMC or LLEF system, the method comprising joining with a substrate multiple first reservoirs wherein selected ones of the multiple first reservoirs include a reducing agent, and wherein first reservoir surfaces of selected ones of the multiple first reservoirs are proximate to a first substrate surface; and joining with the substrate multiple second reservoirs wherein selected ones of the multiple second reservoirs include an oxidizing agent, and wherein second reservoir surfaces of selected ones of the multiple second reservoirs are proximate to the first substrate surface, wherein joining the multiple first reservoirs and joining the multiple second reservoirs comprises: combining the multiple first reservoirs, the multiple second reservoirs, and multiple parallel insulators to produce a pattern repeat arranged in a first direction across a plane, the pattern repeat including a sequence of a first one of the parallel insulators, one of the multiple first reservoirs, a second one of the parallel Insulators, and one of the multiple second reservoirs; and weaving multiple transverse insulators through the first parallel insulator, the one first reservoir, the second parallel insulator, and the one second reservoir in a second direction across the plane to produce a woven apparatus. [0114] Embodiments disclosed herein comprise combination therapies that include the use of biocompatible electrodes. Such combination therapies can include wound healing energy modalities, such as, for example, lasers, plasma, radio frequency, ultrasound, heat, light, and the like. For example in an embodiment the use of biocompatibie electrodes is combined with NPW'T, TOT, ΗΒΟΤ, MLCT, or the like. [0115] in some embodiments reduced or negative pressure (e.g., beiow atmospheric pressure) can be used to assist with the healing of wounds. Certain embodiments can comprise multi-mode therapies wherein the negative pressure applied to the wound site is applied constantly, intermittently, or in levels that increase or decrease over time. [8116] LLMC / LLEF Systems- Methods of Use [0117] Embodiments disclosed herein include LLMC and LIEF systems that can produce an eiectricai stimulus and/or can eleetromotivate, electroconduct, electroinduct, electrotransport, and/or eiectrophorese one or more therapeutic materials in areas of target tissue (e.g., iontophoresis), and/or can cause one or more biologic or other materials in proximity to, on or within target tissue to be affected (e.g., attract, repel, kill, neutralize, or alter cellular growth/viability/mobility, etc.). Further disclosure relating to materials that can produce an eiectricai stimulus can be found in U.S. Patent No. 7,662,176 entitled FOOTWEAR APPARATUS AND METHODS OF MANUFACTURE AND USE issued February 16, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. [0118] Embodiments disciosed herein comprise patterns of microcells. The patterns can be designed to produce an electric field, an electric current, or both over living cells, in embodiments the pattern can be designed to produce a specific size, strength, density, shape, or duration of electric field or electric current, in embodiments reservoir or dot size and separation can be altered. [0119] In embodiments devices disciosed herein can apply an electric field, an electric current, or both wherein the field, current, or both can be of varying size, strength, density, shape, or duration in different areas of a wound or tissue, in embodiments, by micro-sizing the electrodes or reservoirs, the shapes of the electric field, electric current, or both can be customized, increasing or decreasing very localized watt densities and allowing for the design of “smart patterned electrodes” where the amount of ℮ field over a tissue can be designed or produced or adjusted based on feedback from the tissue or on an algorithm within the sensors and fedback to a control module. The electric field, electric current, or both can be strong in one zone and weaker in another. The electric field, electric current, or both can change with time and be modulated based on treatment goals or feedback from the tissue or patient. The control module can monitor and adjust the size, strength, density, shape, or duration of electric field or electric current based on tissue parameters. [0120] A dressing disclosed herein and placed over tissue such as a joint in motion can move relative to the tissue. Reducing the amount of motion between tissue and dressing can be advantages to healing. In embodiments, traction or friction blisters can be treated, minimized, or prevented. Slotting or placing strategic cuts into the dressing can make less friction on the wound, in embodiments, use of an elastic dressing similar to the elasticity of the skin is also possible. The use of the dressing as a temporary bridge to reduce stress across the wound site can reduce stress at the sutures or staples and this will reduce scarring and encourage healing. [0121] Treatment of Wounds [0122] The wound healing process includes several phases, including an inflammatory phase and a proliferative phase. The proliferative phase involves cell migration (such as by human keratinocytes) wherein cells migrate into the wound site and cell proliferation wherein the ceils reproduce. This phase also Involves angiogenesis and the growth of granulation tissue. During cell migration, many epithelial cells have the ability to detect electric fields and respond with directed migration. Their response typically requires Ca2+ influx, the presence of specific growth factors such as Integrin and intracellular kinase activity. Most types of cells migrate directionally in a small electric field, a phenomenon called galvanotaxis or electrotaxis. Electric fields of strength equal to those detected at wound edges direct cell migration and can override some other well-accepted coexistent guidance cues such as contact inhibition. Aspects of the present specification disclose in part a method of treating an individual with a wound. Treating a wound can include covering the wound with a LLMC or LIEF system. Embodiments disclosed herein can promote wound healing by directing ceil migration during the wound healing process. [0123] In embodiments a wound can be an acute or chronic wound, a diabetic wound of the lower extremities, such as of the legs or feet, a post-radiation tissue injury, crush injuries or compartment syndrome and other acute traumatic ischemias, venous stasis or arterial-insufficiency ulcers, compromised grafts and flaps, infected wounds, pressure ulcers, necrotizing soft-tissue infections, burns, cancer-related wounds, osteomyelitis, surgical wounds, traumatic wounds, insect bites, and the like, in an embodiment a wound can be a non-penetrating wound, such as the result of blunt trauma or friction with other surfaces. Typically this type of wound does not break through the skin and may include an abrasion (scraping of the outer skin layer), a laceration (a tear-like wound), a contusion (swollen bruises due to accumulation of blood and dead cells under skin), or the like. In other embodiments a wound can be a penetrating wound. These result from trauma that breaks through the full thickness of skin and include stab wounds (trauma from sharp objects, such as knives), skin cuts, surgical wounds (intentional cuts in the skin to perform surgical procedures), shrapnel wounds (wounds resulting from exploding shells), or gunshot wounds (wounds resulting from firearms). In further embodiments a wound can be a thermal wound such as resulting from heat or cold, a chemical wound such as resulting from an acid or base, an electrical wound, or the like. [0124] Chronic wounds often do not heal in normal stages, and the wounds can also fall to heal in a timely fashion. LLMC and LLEF systems disclosed herein can promote the healing of chronic wounds by increasing cell migration, cell proliferation, and/or cell signaling, increased migration can be seen in various cell types, such as for example keratinocytes, [0125] in embodiments, treating the wound can comprise applying a LLMC or LLEF system to the wound such that the system can stretch with movement of the wound and surrounding area. In certain embodiments, the system can be stretched before application to the wound such that the wound management system "pulls” the wound edges together. [0126] In embodiments, methods for treating or dressing a wound comprises the step of topically administering an additional material on the wound surface or upon the matrix of biocompatible microcells. These additional materials can comprise, for example, activation gels, rhPDGF (REGRANEX®), Vibronectin:IGF complexes, CELLSPRAY®, RECELL®, INTEGRA® dermal regeneration template, BIOMEND®, INFUSE®, ALLODERM®, CYMETRA®, SEPRAPACK®, SEPRAMESH®, SKINTEMP®, MEDFIL®, COSMODERM®, COSMOPLAST®, OP-1®, ISOLAGEN®, CARTICEL®, APLIGRAF®, DERMAGRAFT®, TRANSCYTE®, ORCEL®, EPICEL®, and the like. In embodiments the activation gel can be, for example, TEGADERM® 91110 by 3Μ, MEPILEX® Normal Gel 0.9% Sodium chloride, HISPAGEL®, LUBRIGEL®, or other compositions useful for maintaining a moist environment about the wound or useful for healing a wound via another mechanism. [0127] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, methods of reducing a symptom associated with a wound. In an aspect of this embodiment the symptom reduced is edema, hyperemia, erythema, bruising, tenderness, stiffness, swollenness, fever, a chill, a breathing problem, fluid retention, a blood clot, a loss of appetite, an increased heart rate, a formation of granulomas, fibrinous, pus, or non-viscous serous fluid, a formation of an ulcer, or pain. [0128] Treating a wound can refer to reducing the size of, or preventing an increase in size of a wound. For example, treating can reduce the width of a wound by, e.g., at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90% at least 95%, or at least 100%, [0129] Treating a wound can refer to reducing the depth of, or preventing an increase in depth of a wound. For example, treating can reduce the depth of a wound by, e.g., at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 6o%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90% at least 95%, or at least 100%. [0130] in some embodiments wounds are treated by using a NPWT system comprising a wound management system comprising a dressing comprising a multi-array matrix of biocompatible microcelis, a fluid collection device, one or more conduits, filters, and a negative pressure source {e.g., a vacuum pump). In embodiments the wound dressing comprising a multi-array matrix of biocompatible microcells is placed inside the wound bed then covered with a flexible membrane, for example, a polymeric or elastomeric film. In certain embodiments the wound can be imaged such as in three dimensions (height, width, and depth) and the resuiting information used to produce a wound management system comprising a dressing custom fit to the particular wound. In certain embodiments the wound management system comprises a pliable cover material that “seals” the wound bed to provide an air-tight seal. In embodiments the conduit providing negative pressure to the wound enters the wound under the wound management system or through a slit in the pliable cover material. [9131] in some embodiments the system can be configured to provide a baseline negative pressure of approximately 10-12 mmHg below atmospheric pressure. For example, the baseline negative pressure can be 2 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 3 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 4 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 5 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 6 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 7 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 8 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 9 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 10 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 11 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 12 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 13 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 14 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 15 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 16 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 17 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 18 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 19 mmHg below atmospheric pressure, or 20 mmHg below atmospheric pressure or more, or the like. [0132] in an embodiment, NPWT is administered for 90 minutes once a day for four days, followed by a three-day rest period. This cycle can be repeated for as long as the wound appears to be healing. For example in an embodiment NPWT can be applied for 20 minutes, or 30 minutes, or 40 minutes, or 50 minutes, or 60 minutes, or 70 minutes, or 80 minutes, or 90 minutes, or 100 minutes, or 110 minutes, or 120 minutes, or 130 minutes, or 140 minutes, or 150 minutes, or more, or the like. This can he repeated multiple times in a day, for example NPWT can be administered twice a day, or three times a day, or four times a day, or five times a day, or more, or the like. The therapy can be continued for 1 day, or 2 days, or 3 days, or 4 days, or 5 days, or 6 days, or 7 days, or 8 days, or 9 days, or 10 days, or 11 days, or 12 days, or 13 days, or 14 days, or 15 days, or 16 days, or 17 days, or 18 days, or 19 days, or 20 days or more, or the like. [0133] in certain embodiments the NPWT can comprise rest periods between days of treatment. For example a rest period can be 1 day, or 2 days, or 3 days, or 4 days, or 5 days, or 6 days, or 7 days, or 8 days, or 9 days, or 10 days, or 11 days, or 12 days, or 13 days, or 14 days, or 15 days, or 16 days, or 17 days, or 18 days, or 19 days, or 20 days or more, or the like. [0134] in some embodiments the system can be configured to apply cyclical reduced pressure to the wound in synchrony with the monitored heart activity of the patient received from one or more sensors. In some embodiments the control device can control the negative pressure source to apply a reduced pressure at a first amplitude during duration of systolic period, and to release the reduced pressure at the first amplitude to apply a reduced pressure at a second amplitude during duration of diastolic period. In some embodiments the control device can control the suction source to apply a reduced pressure at a first amplitude during duration of diastolic period, and to release the reduced pressure at the first amplitude to apply a reduced pressure at a second amplitude during duration of systolic period. [0135] In some embodiments the system can be configured to apply cyclical reduced pressure to the wound in synchrony with the monitored blood flow through the wound received from one or more sensors. [0138] in embodiments the negative pressure can be increased at a predetermined rate or cycle. For example the negative pressure applied to the wound can be increased by 10 mmHg, or 20 mmHg, or 40 mmHg, or 60 mmHg, or 80 mmHg, or 100 mmHg, or 120 mmHg, or 140 mmHg, or 160 mmHg, or 180 mmHg, or the like. [0137] in embodiments the increase in negative pressure can be cycled at 10 cycles per minute, or 20 cycles per minute, or 30 cycles per minute, or 40 cycles per minute, or 50 cycles per minute, or 60 cycles per minute, or 80 cycles per minute, or 100 cycles per minute, or 120 cycles per minute or more, or the like. [0138] In certain embodiments TOT can be used to assist with the healing of wounds. For example in some embodiments wounds are treated by using a TOT system comprising a wound management system comprising wound dressing comprising a multi-array matrix of biocompatible microcells, one or more conduits, filters, and an oxygen source configured to apply oxygen to the wound, in embodiments the wound dressing comprising a multi-array matrix of biocompatible microcells is placed inside the wound bed then covered with a flexible membrane, for example a polymeric or elastomeric film. In certain embodiments the wound can be imaged such as in three dimensions (height, width, and depth) and the resulting information used to produce a wound dressing custom fit to the particular wound. In certain embodiments the wound management system comprises a pliable cover material that “seals” the wound bed to provide an air-tight seal. In embodiments the conduit providing the oxygen to the wound enters the wound under the dressing or through a slit in the pliable cover materiai. [0139] in an embodiment, pure oxygen is administered for 90 minutes once a day for four days, followed by a three-day rest period. This cycle can be repeated for as long as the wound appears to be healing. For example in an embodiment pure oxygen can be applied for 20 minutes, or 30 minutes, or 40 minutes, or 50 minutes, or 60 minutes, or 70 minutes, or 80 minutes, or 90 minutes, or 100 minutes, or 110 minutes, or 120 minutes, or 130 minutes, or 140 minutes, or 150 minutes or more, or the like. This can be repeated multiple times in a day, for example oxygen can be administered twice a day, or three times a day, or four times a day, or five times a day, or more, or the like. The therapy can be continued for 1 day, or 2 days, or 3 days, or 4 days, or 5 days, or 6 days, or 7 days, or 8 days, or 9 days, or 10 days, or 11 days, or 12 days, or 13 days, or 14 days, or 15 days, or 16 days, or 17 days, or 18 days, or 19 days, or 20 days or more, or the iike. [0140] in certain embodiments the TOT can comprise rest periods between days of oxygen administration. For example a rest period can be 1 day, or 2 days, or 3 days, or 4 days, or 5 days, or 6 days, or 7 days, or 8 days, or 9 days, or 10 days, or 11 days, or 12 days, or 13 days, or 14 days, or 15 days, or 16 days, or 17 days, or 18 days, or 19 days, or 20 days or more, or the like. [0141] in certain embodiments, ΗΒΟΤ can be used to assist with the healing of wounds. For example in some embodiments wounds are treated by using a FiBOT wound therapy system comprising a wound management system comprising a dressing comprising a multi-array matrix of biocompatible microceils and an oxygen source configured to apply oxygen to a pressure chamber. In certain embodiments the wound can be imaged such as in three dimensions (height, width, and depth) and the resulting information used to produce a wound dressing custom fit to the particular wound. The imaging can be also used to gauge wound healing. [0142] in an embodiment oxygen is administered for 90 minutes once a day for four days, followed by a tbree-day rest period. In embodiments patients breathe 100% oxygen most of the time to maximise the effectiveness of their treatment but have periodic "air breaks" during which they breathe room air (21% oxygen) to minimize the risk of oxygen toxicity. This cycle can be repeated for as long as the wound appeared to be healing. For example, in an embodiment pure oxygen can be applied for 20 minutes, or 30 minutes, or 40 minutes, or 50 minutes, or 60 minutes, or 70 minutes, or 80 minutes, or 90 minutes, or 100 minutes, or 110 minutes, or 120 minutes, or 130 minutes, or 140 minutes, or 150 minutes, or more, or the like. This can be repeated multipie times in a day, for example oxygen can be administered twice a day, or three times a day, or four times a day, or five times a day, or more, or the like. The therapy can be continued for 1 day, or 2 days, or 3 days, or 4 days, or 5 days, or 6 days, or 7 days, or 8 days, or 9 days, or 10 days, or 11 days, or 12 days, or 13 days, or 14 days, or 15 days, or 16 days, or 17 days, or 18 days, or 19 days, or 20 days, or more, or the like. [0143] in certain embodiments the ΗΒΟΤ can comprise rest periods between days of oxygen administration. For example a rest period can be 1 day, or 2 days, or 3 days, or 4 days, or 5 days, or 6 days, or 7 days, or 8 days, or 9 days, or 10 days, or 11 days, or 12 days, or 13 days, or 14 days, or 15 days, or 16 days, or 17 days, or 18 days, or 19 days, or 20 days, or more, or the like. [0144] Certain embodiments employ MLCT in combination with a wound management system comprising a wound dressing comprising a multi-array matrix of biocompatible microcells. For example the wound dressing can comprise a compression bandage, for example a short stretch compression bandage, a long stretch compression bandage, a combination thereof, or the like. Short stretch compression bandages are typically applied to a limb (often for treatment of lymphedema or venous ulcers). This type of bandage is capable of shortening around the limb after application and is therefore not exerting ever-increasing pressure during inactivity. This dynamic is called resting pressure and is considered safe and comfortable for long-term treatment. Conversely the stability of the bandage creates a very high resistance to stretch when pressure is applied through internal muscle contraction and joint movement. This force is called working pressure. Long stretch compression bandages usually have long stretch properties meaning their high compressive power can be easily adjusted. Embodiments disclosed herein provide a method of treating wounds using MLCT wherein the innermost layer of the compression system comprises a multi-array matrix of biocompatible microceils. [0145] Embodiments provide a method of promoting the healing of skin grafts. Following attachment of the graft, the graft is covered with a wound management system comprising a wound dressing comprising a multi-array matrix of biocompatible microceils. The method can further comprise NPWT, TOT, or ΗΒΟΤ to promote healing of the skin graft. In embodiments, the skin graft can be autologous wherein the donor skin is taken from a different site on the same individual's body (also known as an autograft). The graft can also be isogeneic wherein the donor and recipient individuals are genetically identical (e.g., monozygotic twins, animals of a single inbred strain; isograft or syngraft). in embodiments the graft can be allogeneic wherein the donor and recipient are of the same species, in further embodiments the graft can be xenogeneic wherein the donor and recipient are of different species {e.g., bovine cartilage; xenograft or heterograft). In certain embodiments the skin graft can be a prosthetic wherein lost tissue is replaced with synthetic materials such as engineered skin substitutes. [0146] Certain embodiments include wound management systems comprising dressings or bandages designed to be used on irregular, non-planar, or “stretching” surfaces, such as joints. A wound management system disclosed herein can include a discontinuous region such as to allow it to stretch after application to a wound or prior to application to a wound to shield a wound from physical stress. Stretching the wound management system prior to application to the wound can allow the system to “puli” the wound edges together after the system is applied, in certain embodiments the wound management system comprising discontinuous regions is applied without prior stretching, such as to allow stretching of the system in response to movement around the wound site. This can be advantageous during the rehabilitation process. For example, continuous passive motion (CPM) is often used during the first phase of rehabilitation following a soft tissue surgical procedure or trauma. CPM can be carried out by a CPM device, which constantly moves the joint through a controlled range of motion; the exact range is dependent upon the joint, but in most cases the range of motion is increased over time. CPM can be used following various types of reconstructive joint surgery such as knee replacement and ACL reconstruction. Embodiments disclosed herein can be used with numerous joints of the body, including, for example, the jaw, the shoulder, the elbow, the wrist, the finger joints, the hip, the knee, the ankle, the toe joints, etc, [0147] Additional embodiments disclosed herein can be used in areas where tissue is prone to movement such as the eyelid, the ear, the lips, the nose, genitalia, etc. [0148] Aspects of the present specification disclose a method of treating an individual with a wound. In embodiments a wound can be a laceration, an abrasion, an avulsion, or the like. Lacerations typically Involve tissue that is cut or torn. To treat a laceration tissue can be first cleansed of any blood and foreign material, debrided and irrigated. Local anesthetic can be administered and an atraumatic technique of wound closure can be employed, where wound margins are realigned with careful regard to prevention of any further crush injury to tissues. Wound managements systems can be applied and immobilization is recommended for complex extremity wounds. Abrasions typically involve the removal of a superficial layer of tissue as seen with 1st degree burns. The wound can be cleansed of any foreign material, sometimes employing a scrub brush to prevent traumatic tattooing by dirt and gravel. Local anesthetic can he used for pain however treatment of the wound is usually non-surgical, using wound management systems and a topical antibiotic to protect the wound and aid healing. Avulsions are Injuries where a section of tissue is torn off either partially or in total. In partial avulsions, the tissue is elevated but remains attached to the body. A total avulsion means that the tissue is completely torn from the body with no point of attachment. In the case of a partial avulsion where the torn tissue is still well-vascularized and viable, the tissue can be gently cleansed and Irrigated and the flap can be reattached to its anatomical position with a few sutures. If the torn tissue is non-viable it is often excised and the wound closed using a skin graft or local flap. In the case of a total avulsion the tissue is often very thick and demands debulking and defattening methods before it can be regrafted. Major avulsions describe amputation of extremities, fingers, ears, nose, scalp or eyelids. [0149] Τreatment of Bites [0150] Systems disclosed herein can be used to treat animal bites, for example snake bites. A LLMC or LIEF system can be applied to the bite(s) or bitten area, wherein the low level micro-current or electric field can neutralize the immune reaction to the bites or the venom, or neutralize the antigens present in such bites and thus reduce pain and itching, in embodiments the systems and devices disclosed herein can treat venomous bites by altering the function of venoms, such as, for example, protein-based venoms. [0151] Systems disclosed herein can be used to treat insect bites, for example mosquito bites. A LLMC or LLEF system can be applied to the bite(s) or bitten area, wherein the low level micro-current or electric field can neutralize the immune reaction to the bites or any venom and thus reduce pain and Itching. [0152] Treatment of Microbial Infection [0153] Embodiments of the disclosed LLMC and LLEF systems can provide microbicidal activity. For example, embodiments disclosed herein can prevent, limit, or reduce formation of biofilms by interfering with bacterial signaling. Further embodiments can kill bacteria through an established biofilm. [0154] Embodiments of the disclosed LLMC and LLEF systems can provide microbicidal activity. For example, embodiments disclosed herein can prevent, limit, or reduce formation of biofilms by interfering with bacterial signaling. Further embodiments can kill bacteria through an established biofilm. EXAMPLES [0155] The following non-limiting examples are provided for illustrative purposes only in order to facilitate a more complete understanding of representative embodiments. These examples should not be construed to limit any of the embodiments described in the present specification including those pertaining to the methods of treating wounds. Example 1 Cell Migration Assay [0156] The in vitro scratch assay is a well-developed method to measure cell migration in vitro. The basic steps Involve creating a "scratch" in a cell monolayer, capturing images at the beginning and at regular intervals during cell migration to close the scratch, and comparing the images to quantify the migration rate of the cells. Compared to other methods, the in vitro scratch assay is particularly suitable for studies on the effects of cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions on ceil migration, mimic ceil migration during wound healing in vivo and are compatible with imaging of live ceils during migration to monitor intracelluiar events if desired. In addition to monitoring migration of homogenous cell populations, this method has also been adopted to measure migration of individual ceils in the leading edge of the scratch. Not taking into account the time for transfection of ceils, in vitro scratch assay perse usually takes from several hours to overnight. [0157] Human keratinocytes were plated under plated under placebo or a LLMC system (labeled “PROCELLERA®”). Cells were also plated under silver-only or zinc-only dressings. After 24 hours, the scratch assay was performed. The ceils plated under the PROCELLERA® device displayed increased migration into the “scratched” area as compared to any of the zinc, silver, or placebo dressings. After 9 hours, the ceils plated under the PROCELLERA® device had almost “closed” the scratch. This demonstrates the importance of electrical activity to ceil migration and infiltration. [0158] in addition to the scratch test, genetic expression was tested. Increased insulin growth factor (iGF)-1R phosphorylation was demonstrated by the cells plated under the PROCELLERA® device as compared to cells plated under insulin growth factor alone. [0159] Integrin accumulation also affects cell migration. An increase in integrin accumulation can be achieved with the LLMC system. Integrin is necessary for cell migration, and is found on the leading edge of migrating ceil. [0160] Thus, the tested LLMC system enhanced cellular migration and IGF-1R / integrin involvement. This involvement demonstrates the effect that the LLMC system had upon cell receptors involved with the wound healing process. Example 2 Zone of inhibition Test [0161] For cellular repair to be most efficient, available energy should not be shared with ubiquitous microbes. In this “zone of inhibition” test, placebo, a LLMC device (PROCELLERA®) and silver only were tested in an agar medium with a 24 hour growth of organisms. Bacterial growth is present over the placebo, a zone of inhibition over the PROCELLERA® and a minimal inhibition zone over the silver. Because the samples were “buried” in agar, the eleetricida! effect of the LLMC system could be tested. This could mean the microbes were affected by the electrical field or the silver ion transport through the agar was enhanced in the presence of the electric field. Silver Ion diffusion, the method used by silver based antimicrobials, alone was not sufficient. The test demonstrates the improved bactericidal effect of PROCELLERA® as compared to silver alone. Example 3 Wound Care Study [0162] The medical histories of patients who received “standard-of-eare” wound treatment (“SQC”; η ≈ 20), or treatment with a LLMC device as disclosed herein (η = 18), were reviewed. The wound care device used in the present study consisted of a discrete matrix of silver and zinc dots. A sustained voltage of approximately 0.8 V was generated between the dots. The electric field generated at the device surface was measured to be 0.2-1.0 V, 10-50 μΑ. [0163] Wounds were assessed until dosed or healed. The number of days to wound closure and the rate of wound volume reduction were compared. Patients treated with LLIVIC received one application of the device each week, or more frequently in the presence of excessive wound exudate, in conjunction with appropriate wound care management. The LLMC was kept moist by saturating with normal saline or conductive hydrogel. Adjunctive therapies (such as negative pressure wound therapy [NPWTj, etc.) were administered with SOC or with the use of LLMC uniess contraindicated. The SOC group received the standard of care appropriate to the wound, for example antimicrobial dressings, barrier creams, alginates, silver dressings, absorptive foam dressings, hydrogel, enzymatic debridement ointment, NPWT, etc. Etiology-specific care was administered on a case-by-case basis. Dressings were applied at weekly intervals or more. The SOC and LLMC groups did not differ significantly In gender, age, wound types or the length, width, and area of their wounds. [0164] Wound dimensions were recorded at the beginning of the treatment, as well as interim and final patient visits. Wound dimensions, including length (L), width (W) and depth (D) were measured, with depth measured at the deepest point. Wound closure progression was also documented through digital photography. Determining the area of the wound was performed using the length and width measurements of the wound surface area. [0165] Closure was defined as 100% epithelialization with visible effacement of the wound. Wounds were assessed 1 week post-closure to ensure continued progress toward healing during its maturation and remodeling phase. [0166] Wound types included In this study were diverse in etiology and dimensions, thus the time to heal for wounds was distributed over a wide range (9-124 days for SOC, and 3-44 days for the LLMC group). Additionally, the patients often had multiple co-morhidities, including diabetes, renal disease, and hypertension. The average number of days to wound closure was 36.25 (SD = 28.89) for the SOC group and 19.78 (SD = 14.45) for the LLIVIC group, ρ = 0.036. On average, the wounds in the LLMC treatment group attained closure 45.43% earlier than those in the SOC group. [0167] Based on the volume calculated, some wounds improved persistently while others first increased in size before improving. The SOC and the LLMC groups were compared to each other in terms of the number of instances when the dimensions of the patient wounds increased (i.e., wound treatment outcome degraded), in the SOC group, 10 wounds (50% for η = 20) became larger during at least one measurement interval, whereas 3 wounds (16.7% for η ~ 18) became larger in the LLMC group (ρ ≈ 0.018). Overall, wounds in both groups responded positively. Response to treatment was observed to be slower during the initial phase, hut was observed to improve as time progressed. [0168] The LLMC wound treatment group demonstrated on average a 45.4℅ faster closure rate as compared to the SOC group. Wounds receiving SOC were more likely to follow a "waxing-andwaning" progression in wound closure compared to wounds in the LLMC treatment group. [0169] Compared to localized SOC treatments for wounds, the LLMC (1) reduces wound closure time, (2) has a steeper wound closure trajectory, and (3) has a more robust wound healing trend with fewer incidence of increased wound dimensions during the course of healing. Example 4 Treating a knee laceration [0170] A 14 year-old boy injures his knee playing hockey. The emergency room doctor cleans the wound then applies a wound management system as seen in Figure 8 (top). Before applying the bandage, a TEGADERM® 91110 activation gel is applied to the wound surface. The long axis of the bandage is applied vertically across the knee joint with the knee in the straight position. The slits in the foam material of the bandage allow the bandage to stretch when the knee bends. The bandage contains on its inner face an electrode pattern as shown in Figure 1. Example 5 Treating a diabetic ulcer [0171] A 58 year-old male with a history of diabetes has ulcers on bis legs. Ail other treatment modalities have failed to heal the ulcers. A wound management system comprising a bioelectric antimicrobial device containing a multi-array matrix of biocompatibie microceils is applied over the ulcer and changed regularly in accordance with proper wound management. Healing initiation is observed within weeks and the ulcers are fully closed within 5 months. Example 6 Treating an abrasion [0172] A 47 year-old female severely abrades her arms in an automobile accident. Wound management systems as described herein, including an embodiment with discontinuous regions to allow for joint movement, are applied to the woman’s injuries. The Injuries heal without the need for skin grafts. Example 7 Treatment of a full-thickness wound [0173] A 35-year old male suffers from a burn to his shoulder. The burn is excised, then a pliable wound management system comprising a bioelectric antimicrobial device containing a multi-array matrix of biocompatibie microcells is used to cover the wound. The system is designed as described herein to allow for movement about the shoulder joint. The burn heals without the need for skin grafts. Example 8 Τreatment of a surgical site [0174] A 56-year old female suffering from squamous cell carcinoma undergoes a procedure to remove a tumor. The tumor removal site Is covered with a wound management system comprising a bioelectric antimicrobial device containing a multi-array matrix of biocompatible microceils. The surgical site heals with minimal scarring. Example 9 Treatment of open fracture [0175] A 15-year old male suffers a grade-ill open tibia-fibula fracture, leaving exposed bone and muscle. The wound is dressed with wound management systems as described herein comprising a bioelectric antimicrobial device containing a multi-array matrix of biocompatible microceils. The wound heals without the need of muscle or skin grafts. The wound is also kept free from microbial contamination as a result of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect of the wound management systems as disclosed herein. Example 10 Treatment of a surgical site [0176] A 25-year old male suffers a tear of his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Following surgery to repair the ACL, wound management systems comprising a bioelectric antimicrobial dressing material containing a multi-array matrix of hiocompatihle microceils, including embodiments with discontinuous regions to allow for joint movement, are applied to the site of the surgery. The wound is also kept free from microbial contamination as a result of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect of the wound management systems. During phase 1 rehabilitation the following goals are pursued: control post-operative pain, reduce inflammation, provide passive motion in a specific plane of movement, and protect the healing repair or tissue. Continuous passive motion (CRM) is employed to constantly move the joint through a controlled range of motion. The patient recovers fully with no limitations on his physical capabilities. Example 11 Treatment of gunshot wound [0177] A 25-year old male suffers a gunshot wound to his lower abdomen. Bleeding is stopped then the wound is dressed with wound management systems comprising a bioelectric antimicrobial dressing containing a multi-array matrix of hiocompatihle microceils. Over the next 8 weeks the wound heals without the need of skin grafts. The wound is also kept free from microbial contamination as a result of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect of the wound management systems disclosed herein. Example 12 Treatment of laceration [0178] A 25-year old male suffers a deep laceration to his leg. A wound management system as described herein comprising multiple "slits” is stretched then applied across the wound to pull the wound edges together. The wound heals completely with minimal scarring within 4 weeks.
