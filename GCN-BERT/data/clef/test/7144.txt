Process R
3-chloro-4-nitrophenol (5.0 g, 28.8 mmol) was added to ethanol (50 ml) at 26 °C and then iron powder (9.6 g, 172.9 mmol) and acetic acid (10 mL) were added thereto. The solution was stirred at 80 °C for 16 hours and then cooled to 15 °C. The solution was concentrated and purified by column chromatography to give compound 134A (pale red solid, 3.6 g, the yield was 88%).
