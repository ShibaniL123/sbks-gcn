a. Synthesis of 1-isobutoxy-2-isopropylbenzene (34)
To a solution of 2-isopropylphenol (12.5 mL, 92.9 mmols) and 1-bromo-2-methylpropane (20.5 mL, 189 mmols) in DMF (50 mL) was added finely ground potassium carbonate (13.9 g, 101 mmols) and potassium iodide (0.652 g, 3.9 mmols), and the reaction was stirred for 20 h at 70-75Â° C. The reaction solution was then poured into water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layers were washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to provide a crude oil that was purified by column chromatography (1% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to give 34 as a colorless oil (8.7947 g, 50%):
