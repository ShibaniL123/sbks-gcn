Example 9
7-(5-Methanesulfonyl-2-methoxyphenyl)-N-[2-methoxy-4-(piperidin-4-yl)ph enyl]thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-2-amine (Compound 9)
Preparation of compound 9-d.
2-Bromo-4-(methylsulfonyl)phenol (2.0 g, 7.96 mmol) and iodomethane (3.39 g, 23.9 mmol) were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (30 mL) and cesium carbonate (7.79 g, 23.9 mmol) was added thereto. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours and the mixed solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was added to water (15 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (30 mL Ã— 2). The combined organic phases were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to deliver compound 9-d (2 g, yield: 94.7%). This product was used without further purification.
