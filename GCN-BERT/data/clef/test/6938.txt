Technical Field The present invention relates to a protection device with increased functionality, particularly for syringes and the like. Background Art In the field of medical or laboratory instruments, needle instruments are known, such as syringes and the like, which are adapted to extract and/or inject liquids by means of a needle. Since it can happen that the liquids handled with such needle instruments contain substances that are contaminant or harmful to humans, conventional needle instruments are generally provided with a covering cap that fits over the needle of the instrument, to protect it, and which can be removably fixed to the instrument in such a way as to avoid accidental injury to the operator or to avoid the operator coming into contact with the contaminant or harmful substances when the needle is not being used for performing extraction or injection operations. More precisely, the covering cap has a cannula shape of length substantially equal to that of the needle to be covered and with at least one end perforated so as to allow the needle of the instrument to be inserted. In this way, the needle of the instrument, which is integral with the instrument proper, can be repeatedly inserted into and extracted from the covering cap between one extraction and the next or between one injection and the next. Typically, the recapping operation is performed manually by the operator, holding the covering cap in one hand and the needle instrument in the other hand. During such operation, it can happen that inadvertently, the operator misses the entry hole of the covering cap, thus sending the needle into contact with the fingers of his/her hand, leading to the contamination thereof with the liquid being handled, or simply injuring himself/herself with the point of the needle. To overcome this drawback, protection devices are known which consist of a tubular grip which is adapted to accommodate the protective cap of the needle instruments and which is provided, at one end thereof, with a protection pan perforated at the inner cavity of the grip in order to permit the insertion into and the extraction from the covering cap between one extraction and the next or between one injection and the next. In this way, the operator's hand that holds the covering cap, by gripping the conventional protection device by its grip, is protected by the pan so as to prevent accidental injury or contamination. Once the needle has been extracted from the respective covering cap, the cap remains accommodated in the grip of the protection device until the next recapping. Conventional protection devices are not devoid of drawbacks, including the fact that they cannot be placed on a resting surface, for example a worktable, in a stable position if the needle instrument is inserted with its needle in the tubular grip. Indeed, by placing it on an edge, there is the risk that the needle instrument will come out of the grip or that it will fall off the worktable it is resting on. Devices suitable to offer protection to an operator from injury by contaminated syringe or hypodermic needles are known, for example, from the documents EP 0 361 139 A1, US 4 781 697 and EP 0 192 453 A2. Disclosure of the invention The aim of the present invention is to provide a protection device with improved functionality, particularly for syringes and the like, which enables both its stable positioning on a resting surface even with the needle applied to the needle instrument and also the recapping of the needle even with one hand only. Within this aim, an object of the present invention consists in providing a protection device with improved functionality that is simple to implement, easy to use, and at low cost. This aim, as well as these and other objects which will become better apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a protection device, according to the present invention, that has the features set forth in claim 1.

Ways of carrying out the invention With reference to the figures, the protection device with improved functionality, particularly for syringes and the like, generally designated with the reference numeral 1, comprises a supporting body 2 which is substantially disk-like. In more detail, the supporting body 2 is also provided with a hole 3, arranged coaxially to the supporting body 2, for the insertion of the covering cap 4 of a needle 5 of a syringe 6 or the like. As will be better described hereinafter, the hole 3 has a diameter that is substantially larger than the diameter of the central portion 4a of the covering cap 4 and substantially smaller than the diameter of the end portion 4b of the covering cap 4 at the end for the insertion of the needle 5 so as to ensure the engagement between the two. According to the invention, the supporting body 2 has at least one flat face 7, arranged on the opposite side with respect to the face for the insertion of the covering cap 4 in the hole 3, for the resting contact of the supporting body 2 on a resting surface 8 or the like in a first stable position. Advantageously, on the supporting body 2, on the opposite side with respect to the flat face 7, there is a face 9 provided with a raised perimetric containment rim 10. In the center of the face 9, at the hole 3 and coaxially thereto, a collar 11 is provided, that extends from the face 9 and which acts as a guide element for vertically supporting the covering cap 4 with the supporting body 2 placed on the resting surface 8 with its flat face 7. In more detail, the collar 11 extends substantially at right angles from the face 9 for a length that is shorter than the height of the outer perimetric rim 10, in order to permit the resting contact of the supporting body 2 on the side of the rim 10 on the resting surface 8 or the like, with the flat face 7 directed upward. With such geometry, the collar 11 defines an abutment surface 12 upon which the flange 13 of the protection cap 4, if present, engages by contact. If the flange 13 is not provided, the protection cap 4 having only a conicalness concordant with the direction of insertion in the hole 3, then the end portion 4b, being radially larger than the central portion 4a, engages by mechanical interference the hole 3. The collar 11 has a length that is such as to allow the protection cap 4 to protrude for a predominant portion thereof from the face 7 of the device, when the device is lifted off the resting surface. Operation of the protection device 1 with improved functionality, particularly for syringes and the like, is as follows. With particular reference to Figures 1 to 6, with the covering cap 4, which is fitted over so as to protect the needle 5 of the syringe 6, inserted in the hole 3 of the supporting body 2, it is possible to disengage the covering cap 4 from the syringe 6 by gripping it at its central portion 4a with the same hand with which the protection device 1 is supported and pulling, with the other hand, the syringe 6. Similarly, as shown in Figures 7 and 8, once the withdrawal and injection operations are performed, by repeating the procedure just described in reverse it is possible to reinsert the needle 5 into the protection cap 4. Advantageously, as shown in Figures 5 and 6, once the protection cap 4 is removed from the syringe 6, due to the shape of the protection device 1 it is possible to position it in two stable positions: a first in which the face 9 is turned downward, i.e. with the flat face 7 resting on the resting surface 8, and a second with the face 9 turned upward, i.e. with the outer rim 10 resting on the resting surface 8. In more detail, as shown in Figure 7, with the protection device 1 arranged in the first stable position it is possible to perform the operation of recapping the needle 5 of the syringe 6 with one hand only, thus ending up with the syringe 6 and with the needle 5 reinserted in the protection cap 4 which in turn is inserted in the hole 3; in this way, the syringe 6 is held in a vertical position thanks to the support provided by the collar 11 as shown in Figure 3. Moreover, as shown in Figures 9 to 11, beginning from both of the stable positions, it is always possible to decide later whether to dispose of the entire syringe 6 or whether to dispose of the recapped needle 5 separately from the rest of the syringe 6, by detaching the two parts with both hands again using the protection device 1. In practice it has been found that the protection device with improved functionality, particularly for syringes and the like, according to the present invention, fully achieves the intended aim and object in that its geometry enables it to be arranged in two stable positions from which it is possible to perform the procedure of recapping the needle of the syringe using both hands or only one hand at the operator's discretion. Indeed, the choice is linked to the operator's will and not to the geometric shape of the protection device, according to the invention, unlike the background art. The choice of how to perform this operation is therefore left entirely to the operator who can change it at any time according to his/her needs. It is not therefore a choice imposed by the device proper but one which depends only on the operator's will. Whether using the device with one hand or with two hands the possibly contaminated surface is always the same and is never in any way in contact with either the operator or the surfaces upon which the device is rested. By using the device according to the invention it is also possible to correctly perform a differentiated waste collection. Such possibility relates to the use of the device as a recipient for containing other material (e.g. glass of a phial or used cotton) when it is placed on a surface for recapping with one hand only. Indeed in this case, once the needle is recapped it is possible, after lifting the device off the resting surface, to grip the cap of the syringe from below so as to prevent the contents of the device from falling and, with a small rotational movement, separate the recapped needle from the body and then dispose of the body in a first container and then, still holding the cap, it is possible, by overturning the device, to dispose of the contents in a second container and finally, by releasing the cap, to dispose of the recapped needle in a third container. Another advantage of the protection device according to the present invention consists in that, when arranged with the rim turned upward, it is possible to use it as a recipient in which what is needed for performing the injection can be temporarily accommodated and therefore transported before performing it and, later, in which discarded material like vials, cotton or other materials can be disposed of temporarily after use, so as to not have to contaminate any other surface. Another advantage of the protection device, according to the present invention, consists in that the flat face that comes into contact with the operator's hand or hands never comes into contact under any circumstances with parts of the syringe which are potentially contaminant, thus protecting the operator's hands from direct contact with parts of the syringe that are potentially contaminant. Another advantage of the protection device, according to the present invention, consists in that the protruding position of the protection cap from the same side as the perimetric rim, as well as making it possible to recap the needle using two hands or only one hand, makes it more compact, and gives it a more homogeneous shape, thus making it better arrangeable and transportable in that it is free from surfaces that protrude outside the concave side of the protection device. A further advantage of the protection device, according to the present invention, consists in that it is easier to handle and easier to clean thanks to its round shape, free from sharp corners and edges where dirt can become deposited. Another advantage of the protection device, according to the present invention, consists in that it is economically competitive in comparison to the background art. The protection device with improved functionality, particularly for syringes or the like, thus conceived, is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of the appended claims. In addition, all the details may be replaced by other, technically equivalent elements. In practice the materials employed, provided they are compatible with the specific use, and the contingent dimensions and shapes, may be any according to requirements and to the state of the art.
