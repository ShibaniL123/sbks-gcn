BRIEF SUMMARY Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a ball striking teaching tool and more particularly to a tool that provides an instantly self-resetting movable and displaceable yet secured ball, to facilitate the opportunity for the practicing individual to hit hundreds of more practice balls than the practicing individual would be able to accomplish during the course of a standard tennis practice session and by doing so promote improved ball striking by repeated simulation of proper ball stroke and striking form. Thus improving stroke proficiency by improving the practicing individual's muscle memory, eye hand coordination and the muscle strength within the specific muscle groups that, most involve ball striking proficiency. OBJECT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a lightweight, portable but stabilized ball striking practice device. It is a further object of the present invention to provide such an apparatus which will enable striking of a ball while still or in motion so as to enhance eye hand coordination. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a device which will be readily adaptable to simulate game or practice conditions. It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a device usable by physically challenged individuals such as someone confined to a wheelchair. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a tool designed for practicing and helping with the teaching of proper ball hitting technique as in baseball and or proper stroking technique as in tennis. Over the years many devices have been developed in an attempt to provide the necessary benefit and feature of striking a target ball that has the feel of stroking a free and live, yet controlled tennis ball that instantly self resets itself to a predetermined position. Ball striking practice devices are well known in the prior art. Of particular reference are three practice devices U.S. Pat. No. 4,079,934 of Nixon issued Mar. 21, 1978, U.S. Pat. No. 4,003,572 of Harvey issued Jan. 18, 1977, U.S. Pat. No. 4,216,960 of Nicholls issued Aug. 12, 1980. The common drawback of each of these noted and issued patents, are obvious, the ball can't be struck using a standard driving forehand or backhand tennis stroke and at the same time, not have the racket become disruptively entangled with the ball tethering mechanism of the device. Tennis is a sport that calls for hitting a moving target, in tennis the moving target unit is the tennis ball, proficiency at hitting a moving target unit is best accomplished by first learning to be proficient and consistent at hitting a still or stationary target unit sighting as an example the marksman who has become a champion marksman whom, without a doubt began by becoming proficient and consistent at hitting a stationary or still target before improving and graduating to a moving target.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments Now referring to FIG. 1 there is illustrated a ball striking practice tool particularly adapted to tennis in accordance with the present invention includes an anti-skid material (1) such as rubber may be provided as a foundation for the base (2) as illustrated. The base (2) should be of, sufficient weight and mass necessary for stable support of the rigid up-right post FIG. 6. FIG. 6 illustrates a rigid rectangular upright post that must be attached and fixed on end, to the top side of the base illustrated as (3) in FIG. 1 While the base has been shown as being in the shape of a pentagon it should be understood that other shapes may be submitted (so long as) the alternative shapes are within the purview of the present invention. Additionally in FIG. 6 is a through hole (1) drilled through the sides of the rigid up-right post illustrated in FIG. 6. The through hole (1) is sufficient to make use of a through peg (2). Referring now to FIG. 7, which illustrates a hollow, rectangular and upright sleeve. Hollow so as to receive the rigid upright post FIG. 6. In addition the rigid, hollow upright sleeve FIG. 7 is measured so as to have an inner circumference roughly the equivalent of the outer circumference of the rigid upright post FIG. 6. So as to bring about a snug fitting, easy sliding motion between the outer sleeve FIG. 7 and the rigid upright post FIG. 6. As a further description of the rigid upright outer fitting sleeve FIG. 7 there are through holes (1A),(1B),(1C) drilled through the sides of the easy sliding sleeve FIG. 7, these appropriate through holes (1A),(1B),(1C), along with the appropriate through hole of the upright post (1) and peg (2) of FIG. 6 will be the means by which the present invention is made height adjusted in regards to the playing surface. With the exception of the non-skid material forming the foundation (1) for the base (2) of FIG. 1, the preferred constructing material would be a type of moldable plastic such as a, high or low density polyurethane which is lightweight and moldable, then can be made hard set and rigid. The wand will now be described with reference to FIG. 1. The wand (2) is a single piece of linear piping that has been molded, curved, bent and geniculated so as to appropriately fit the needs of the present invention. The curved, bent and geniculated wand (2) will have a roughly similar appearance to a question mark with a slightly elongated tail. The wand (2) now must be rigid and stabilized. Stabilization is increased by the use of stabilizer slats (3A) and (3B) which are interconnected to the over and under lengths of the rigid bent and geniculated wand (2). In addition the wand (2) is fitted with a detachable Y-shaped target unit ball mounting (4). The Y-shaped target unit ball mounting, (4) will mounts a mounted ball (9) that is set on a spindle (5) that is received onto a small through rod (through rod not illustrated) that is fixed and set in such a manner as to allow the target unit ball (9) to spin freely on an axis. The Y-shaped target unit ball mounting (4) can be twisted so as to change the axis upon which the target unit ball (9) spends which would allow the practicing individual to simulate and practice different types of spin, slice or cut shots. For ball (9) striking practice the wand (2) will be mounted in the crown of the height adjusting sleeve FIG. 7) by use of a single through peg (2) of FIG. 6 and a appropriate through holes (2A), (2B) at the crown of the adjustable sleeve FIG. 7 the wand (2) of FIG. 1 will be allowed to teeter freely along a longitudinal direction. The full range of the free swinging wand (2) will begins at a predetermined set position illustrated in FIG. 1 and extends all the way to a predetermined fully displaced position FIG. 4. The full range of the displaced wand is best illustrated by a comparison of FIG. 3 and FIG. 4. In the set position when the target unit ball (9) of FIG. 1 is struck by a tennis racket the target unit ball (9), the Y-shaped ball mounting unit FIG. 9 and the upper portion of the wand (2) of FIG. 1 all move generally upward and away from the striking tennis racket. The generally upward and away movement of the target unit ball (9) and wand (2) of FIG. 1 Functions to simulate a struck tennis ball in free or unencumbered movement. FIG. 2, in the displaced position the wand (1) instantly self-rebound and re-set by making use of the combined resistance and restoring force of the counterbalance (4) of FIG. 2 and the full engaged bungee cord (3). The bungee cord (3) will be attached on one end near the end of the wand (1) at the head of the counterbalance (4) with the other end of the bungee cord (3) being attached to the center, front side of the height adjustable sleeve. Both ends of the bungee cord (3) are secured yet detachable by means of hooks or holes. FIG. 2 best illustrates the fully displaced wand (1) and the full engaged bungee cord (3). The counterbalance weight (4) and the bungee cord (3) will be the means by which the target the unit ball (5) of FIG. 2 and wand (1) will return to the full reset position. By varying the length of the bungee cord (3) of FIG. 2 a variety of ball return velocities can be achieved, thus allowing the practicing individual to practice the striking of incoming balls in rapid repeated fashion before the ball (5) returns to the fully set position. By making use of longer bungee cords the practicing individual can practice striking incoming balls at optionally decreased velocities. By making use of the benefits and features of the present invention the practicing individual will be allowed to practice tennis strokes at a variety of heights, a variety of incoming velocities and in addition the practicing individual will be allowed to practice a variety of shots such as flat shots, spin shots, chop shots and slice shots. The ability of the present invention to simulate a number of varied tennis shots will help to improve the tennis game of both new and advanced tennis players, and in addition the present invention readily lends itself to a method of practical and economic training for the tennis practicing individual. For example a number of the present inventions could be placed, located and situated in desired positions on, and or around a tennis court such as near the baseline or near the net or intermediate thereof or near the sidelines to simulate a series of ball strikes in a continuing ball striking simulation. Thus the tennis practicing individual would be able to move practicing proper footwork from apparatus to apparatus along a particular route that has been arranged to simulate the various movements and shots that will arise for a tennis player during an actual tennis match. The practicing individual will also be allowed to practice a type of shot at each location in a continuing circuit, in this manner, a number of practicing individuals such as in a high school or college tennis team or individuals in a tennis aerobics class could quickly and efficiently practice an appropriate ball striking and at the same time practice the tennis appropriate, specialized footwork. An additional benefit of the present invention is the fact that footwork and tennis stroke practice can be achieved an area significantly smaller than a tennis court. Although the preferred embodiments and materials have been described and explained, it should be understood that various changes, adaptations and modifications may possibly be made therein without departing from the spirit, scope and appended claims of the present invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention comprises a set and self-re-settable, stationary or moving target-unit ball striking device, primarily for practicing or teaching of ball striking within a ball striking sports such as in baseball and more specifically such as in tennis, in which a rigid base perpendicularly supports a rigid and by design, unmoving upright post the rigid upright post is now fitted with a rigid and measured to fit snug, outer sleeve with, appropriate and exacting matching holes drilled through the snug fitting outer sleeve and upright post these matching holes used in combination with a removable through peg will serve to provide height adjustability to the device, the aforementioned target unit ball will be mounted at the head of a wand, said wand has been bent curved and geniculated into a shape that greatly resembles the bends, curves and general shape of a “question mark” (?). At the opposite end of the wand, away the head of the wand will be a specifically weighted counterbalance connected to the wand's tail end, a hook will be provided near the end of the wand to accommodate the connecting of one end of a bungee cord that will work in cooperation with the specifically weighted counterbalance to re-bound and re-set the device, wherein the ball mounting end of the wand is now almost directly above the weighted counterbalance and bungee corded configured end of the wand, The wand will now be appropriately mounted in the crown of the snug fitting height adjusting sleeve, by the use of a through pivot peg and a set of measured holes drilled through the crown of the snug fitting height adjusting sleeve. A rigid Y-shaped ball mounting, using a spindle and a small rod will allow the target unit ball to spin along an axis in a manner that resembles a ball struck with the intentions of producing topspin, in addition the Y-shaped ball mounting itself can be twisted in such a way to produce a different angled axis allowing the practicing individual to practice different types of slice, chop cut and spin strokes. When the set target unit ball is struck in particular with a baseball bat or tennis racket the ball the spindle the Y-shaped ball mounting and the wand are all displaced and will move generally upward and away from the striking bat or racket. The uniquely bent and curved configured wand will instantly self-rebound from the displaced position to the original predetermined set position. An additional advantage in regards to the present invention will be the use of varying lengths and resistant strengths of the said bungee cords. In the instantly self-rebounding process varying of the length and resistant strength of said bungee cords will produce a variety of instantly self-rebounding resistance, speed and velocity choices. These variations of rebounding resistance and velocity speed choices can, in a practice session simulate the varieties of speeds and velocities a tennis player will encounter in the playing of an actual tennis game. And therefore causing the player to be better prepared and more proficient during a tennis match. Another additional feature in regard to the present invention is that, by the use of this invention a practicing individual can strengthen the specific muscle groups and muscle memory that goes hand-in-hand with improved batting and tennis stroke development.
