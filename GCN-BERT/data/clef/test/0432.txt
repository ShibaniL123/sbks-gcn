Botanical designation: Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd. Cultivar denomination: ‘RFAM440’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Poinsettia plant, botanically known as Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd., and hereinafter referred to by the name ‘RFAM440’. Plants of the new Poinsettia have not been made available publicly nor sold for more than one year prior to the filing of this application. The new Poinsettia plant is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in Rheinberg, Germany. The objective of the breeding program is to create vigorous Poinsettia plants with attractive flower bract coloration. The new Poinsettia plant is a naturally occurring whole plant mutation of a proprietary selection of Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd. identified as code number F-16-0816, not patented. The new Poinsettia plant was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a flowering plant within a population of plants of the proprietary parent selection in a controlled greenhouse environment in Rheinberg, Germany in December, 2013. Asexual reproduction of the new Poinsettia plant by terminal vegetative cuttings in a controlled greenhouse environment in Rheinberg, Germany since December, 2013 has shown that the unique features of this new Poinsettia plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations of asexual reproduction. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Plants of the new Poinsettia have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions and cultural practices. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environmental conditions such as temperature, daylength and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘RFAM440’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘RFAM440’ as a new and distinct Poinsettia plant: 1. Compact, upright and outwardly spreading plant habit.2. Moderately vigorous growth habit.3. Early flowering habit.4. Inflorescences with dark pink-colored flower bracts.5. Excellent post-production longevity. Plants of the new Poinsettia differ primarily from plants of the proprietary parent selection in the following characteristics: 1. Plants of the new Poinsettia are not as vigorous as plants of the proprietary parent selection.2. Flower bracts of plants of the new Poinsettia are darker pink in color than flower bracts of plants of the proprietary parent selection. Plants of the new Poinsettia can be compared to plants of Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd. ‘RFPHPG1’, not patented. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Rheinberg, Germany, plants of the new Poinsettia differed primarily from plants of ‘RFPHPG1’ in the following characteristics: 1. Plants of the new Poinsettia were more vigorous than plants of ‘RFPHPG1’.2. Flower bracts of plants of the new Poinsettia were darker pink in color than flower bracts of plants of ‘RFPHPG1’. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH The accompanying photograph illustrates the overall appearance of the new Poinsettia plant showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photograph may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describe the colors of the new Poinsettia plant. The photograph comprises a top perspective view of a typical flowering plant of ‘RFAM440’ grown in a container. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The aforementioned photograph and following observations and measurements describe plants grown in Rheinberg, Germany during the summer in a glass-covered greenhouse and under cultural practices typical of commercial Poinsettia production. During the production of the plants, day and night temperatures averaged 22° C. and light levels averaged 4,500 lux. Single plants were grown in 12-cm containers and were pinched one time about three weeks after planting the cuttings. Two weeks after pinching, the photoinductive treatments (long nyctoperiods) were initiated. Plants were 16 weeks old when the photograph and the detailed description were taken. In the following description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, 1995 Edition, except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
