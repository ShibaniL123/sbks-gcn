CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application is a non-provisional application of, and claims priority to, U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/983,133, filed on Apr. 23, 2014 and titled “Shock-Wave Mitigating Bio-Inspired Football Helmet Design,” which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT This invention was made with Government support under DE-EE0002323 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI), commonly referred to as “a concussion,” is an injury that frequently occurs in contact sports, such as football. Sport-related brain injuries have been estimated to occur 1.6 to 3.8 million times every year. Additionally, it is estimated that some football players receive up to 1,500 head impacts per season. Although every impact may not result in MTBI, numerous impacts to the head can result in long-term brain damage through an impact induced neurodegenerative disease known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure relates to helmets that protect a wearer's head and reduce the likelihood of the wearer experiencing Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI), Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), or other types of injuries. The helmet in some embodiments comprises a shell that has a first portion and a second portion. The first portion of the shell may include a core layer that is surrounded by layers that are denser than the core layer. For example, the core layer may be constructed of a foam, and the surrounding layers may be constructed of a para-aramid synthetic fiber, such as a KEVLAR fiber, fixed in a matrix. Because the core layer is less dense than the surrounding layers, the first portion of the shell may mitigate shock waves that are imparted to the helmet. Furthermore, in some embodiments, a suture may be formed in one of the layers that surrounds the core layer. An elastomeric adhesive may be disposed in the suture to hold portions of the layer together. The suture and elastomeric adhesive may also mitigate shock waves that are imparted to the helmet. In addition, the second portion of the shell may include multiple energy dissipators, such as elastomeric tapered spirals. The energy dissipators may be configured to dissipate energy imparted to the helmet. In particular, the energy dissipators may dissipate energy through shear action in the energy dissipators. Thus, various embodiments of the helmets described herein may mitigate shock waves, trap momentum, and dissipate energy so that the risk of wears experiencing injuries, such as MTBI and CTE, are reduced. In the following discussion, a general description of the system and its components is provided, followed by a discussion of the operation of the same. With reference to FIG. 1, shown is a cross-section of an example of a helmet 100 according to various embodiments. The helmet 100 shown in FIGS. 1A-1C is embodied in the form of a football helmet. However, in alternative embodiments, the helmet 100 may be embodied in the form of other types of athletic helmets, such as hockey helmets, lacrosse helmets, etc. Additionally, the helmet 100 in other examples may be embodied in the form of a racing helmet, such as an automotive racing helmet, a motorbike racing helmet, etc. In addition, the helmet 100 in alternative examples may be embodied in the form of a tactical helmet, which may be used, for example, by law enforcement or military personnel. The helmet 100 may comprise a shell 103, a facemask 106, a liner (not shown), and/or other components. The shell 103 may be the outermost portion of the helmet 100 that surrounds at least a portion of the wear's head. Accordingly, the exterior surface of the shell 103 may contact objects, such as other helmets 100, when in use. The facemask 106 may protect the face of the wearer of the helmet 100. With reference to FIG. 2A, shown is a cross-section of a portion of an example of the shell 103 according to various embodiments. The shell 103 illustrated in FIG. 2A is a multilayer shell 103 that comprises a first portion 203 and a second portion 206. For the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the first portion 203 of the shell 103 is on the exterior side of the shell 103, and the second portion 206 of the shell 103 is on the interior side of the shell 103. However, in alternative embodiments, the first portion 203 of the shell 103 may be on the interior side of the shell 103, and the second portion 206 of the shell 103 may be on the exterior side of the shell 103. Additionally, for the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2, the first portion 203 of the shell 103 is in direct contact with the second portion 206 of the shell 103. In alternative embodiments, the first portion 203 of the shell 103 may be separated from the second portion 206 of the shell 103. FIGS. 2A and 2B show different configurations for the shell. The embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2A shows that the first portion 203 of the shell 103 may include a core layer 209 that is positioned between a first surrounding layer 213 and a second surrounding layer 216. The first surrounding layer 213 and the second surrounding layer 216 may comprise a para-aramid synthetic fiber, such as a KEVLAR, carbon, E-glass, or S-Glass fiber, that is fixed in a polymeric matrix. In FIG. 2B, a layer 214 is added that may be a very hard, slippery layer comprising a thermoset or thermoplastic on the outside of layer 213. Such a matrix for any configuration in FIGS. 2A-2B may comprise polypropylene, polyurethane, polycarbonate, and/or any other suitable material. The first surrounding layer 213 and the second surrounding layer 216 may be denser and less porous than the core layer 209. FIG. 2B also includes layer 215, which comprises a wavy suture material made of a nonlinear highly deforming elastic material, viscoelastic, and/or viscoplastic material. Layer 216 comprises a polymeric thermoplastic or thermoset that is highly ductile that can be, but is not limited to, a polycarbonate, sorbothane, etc. For the configuration illustrated in FIG. 2A, the core layer 209 may comprise a foam. For example, the core layer 209 in one embodiment comprises a polymeric foam that can be, but is not limited to, a SUNMATE foam. The core layer 209 may be less dense and more porous than both the first surrounding layer 213 and the second surrounding layer 216. Accordingly, the first portion 203 of the shell 103 may be functionally graded. For the configuration illustrated in FIG. 2B, layer 217 can be a closed or open cell polymeric foam that can be used for energy absorption. This foam material can be, but is not limited to, a SUNMATE foam. The second portion 206 of the shell 103 may include a side layer 219, a plurality of energy dissipators 223, and a plurality of support columns 226a-226c. In some embodiments, the side layer 219 may comprise a para-aramid synthetic fiber, such as a KEVLAR, carbon, E-glass, or S-glass fiber, fixed in a matrix, such as a polypropylene, polyurethane, polycarbonate, and/or any other suitable matrix. The support columns 226a-226c may attach the side layer 219 to the first portion 203 of the shell 103. For the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2B, the support columns 226a-226c attach to both the side layer 219 and the second surrounding layer 213. In addition, the support columns 226a-226c may position the side layer 219 so that the side layer 219 does not contact the energy dissipators 223. In some embodiments, the support columns 226a-226c comprise a polycarbonate. The energy dissipators 223 are configured to dissipate energy that is imparted to the helmet 100. In some embodiments, an energy dissipator 223 may dissipate energy by a shearing action in the energy dissipator 223. Examples of energy dissipators 223 are described in further detail below. In some embodiments, the energy dissipators 223 may be arranged in rows throughout at least a portion of the shell 103, as illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2B. With reference to FIG. 3, shown is a cross-section of a portion of another example of the shell 103, referred to herein as the shell 103a, according to various embodiments. The shell 103a has some features that are similar to the shell 103 illustrated in FIG. 2. However, the first surrounding layer 213 of the first portion 203 of the shell 103 is segmented into a first surrounding layer portion 213a and a second surrounding layer portion 213b. In particular, a suture 303 may exist between the first surrounding layer portion 213a and the second surrounding layer portion 213b. The suture 303 may be regarded as being a relatively rigid joint between the first surrounding layer portion 213a and the second surrounding layer portion 213b. In some embodiments, the suture 303 may extend around the entire shell 103. In other embodiments, the suture 303 may extend around only a portion of the shell 103. The suture 303 may comprise an elastomeric adhesive. In addition to attaching the first surrounding layer portion 213a to the second surrounding layer portion 213b, the elastomeric adhesive may facilitate shear deformation in the first surrounding layer 213 when the helmet 100 is subjected to an impact. The suture 303 may have a sinusoidal shape that is curved to conform to the shape of the shell 103. In these embodiments, the ratio of the amplitude to the wavelength may be within the range from about 0.25 to about 2.0. With reference to FIG. 4, shown is an example of an energy dissipator 223 according to various embodiments. The energy dissipator 223 may comprise an elastomeric material, such as rubber. In some embodiments, the energy dissipator 223 may comprise a shock mitigating element, such as a tapered spiral shaped element described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/469,172, filed on May 11, 2012 and titled “Shock Mitigating Materials and Methods Utilizing Spiral Shaped Elements,” which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The energy dissipator 223 illustrated in FIG. 4 comprises a tapered spiral structure. In particular, the energy dissipator 223 shown comprises a base 403 and a tip 406 that has a diameter less than the diameter of the tip 406. In some embodiments, the ratio of the diameter of the tip 406 to the diameter of the base 403 may be within the range from about 0.1 to about 0.9. Additionally, the ratio of the diameter of the base 403 to the spiral length may be from about 0.01 to about 1.0. The base 403 of the energy dissipator 223 may be attached directly to the second surrounding layer 216 of the first portion 203 of the shell 103. When the helmet 100 is subjected to an impact, energy may be transferred to the energy dissipator 223 and dissipated through shear action in the energy dissipator 223. With reference to FIG. 5, shown is another example of an energy dissipator 223, referred to herein as the energy dissipator 223a. The energy dissipator 223a is a tapered conic helix structure. In this regard, the energy dissipator 223a forms a conic helix, and the diameter of the energy dissipator 223a tapers as the length progresses from the base 403a to the tip 406a. The base 403a of the energy dissipator 223a may be attached directly to the second surrounding layer 216 of the first portion 203 of the shell 103. When the helmet 100 is subjected to an impact, energy may be transferred to the energy dissipator 223a and dissipated through shear action in the energy dissipator 223a. With reference to FIG. 6, shown is another example of an energy dissipator 223, referred to herein as the energy dissipator 223b. The energy dissipator 223b is a tetrahedral structure. As such, the energy dissipator 223b tapers from the base 403b to the tip 406b. The base 403b of the energy dissipator 223b may be attached directly to the second surrounding layer 216 of the first portion 203 of the shell 103. When the helmet 100 is subjected to an impact, energy may be transferred to the energy dissipator 223b and dissipated through shear action in the energy dissipator 223b. Numerical values may be expressed herein in a range format. Such a range format is used for convenience and brevity, and thus, should be interpreted in a flexible manner to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. To illustrate, a concentration range of “about 0.1% to about 5%” should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited concentration of about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt %, but also include individual concentrations (e.g., 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%) and the sub-ranges (e.g., 0.5%, 1.1%, 2.2%, 3.3%, and 4.4%) within the indicated range. The term “about” may include traditional rounding according to significant figures of the numerical value.
