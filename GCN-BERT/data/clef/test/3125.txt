Step 8: tert-butyl (2R,3S)-2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-5-hydroxyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-ylcarbamate
Tert-butyl (2R,3S)-2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-3-ylcarbamate (2.81g, 9.04 mmol) was dissolved in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran and cooled to -10°C. Borane-dimethyl sulfide complex (2.26 mL, 22.6 mmol) was added dropwise, stirred at low temperature for 2 hours and then warmed to 15°C. To the solution was added IN sodium hydroxide solution (27.1 mL, 27.1 mmol) and sodium perborate (4.17 g, 27.1 mmol), and stirred overnight. 100 mL water was added. The organic phase was separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phases were combined, washed with water, dried and concentrated, and then the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol, 30:1-12:1) to give the product tert-butyl (2R,3S)-2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-5-hydroxyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl carbamate (2.33g) as a white solid in 78% yield.
