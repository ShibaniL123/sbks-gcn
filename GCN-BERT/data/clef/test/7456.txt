DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION Embodiments of the present invention are directed to devices for growth and in vitro measurements of functional muscle tissue layers that are effective and more efficient for, for example, high throughput assays, multiplexed apparatuses including such devices, methods of making such devices and apparatuses, and methods of using such devices and apparatuses. Examples of the integration of strain- sensitive elements into devices that support adhered muscle tissue layers to allow electronic readout and quantification of the force generated by the muscle tissue are described. Such in-line electrical force sensing enables devices including muscle tissues to serve as mass producible, high throughput models for biomedical and pharmaceutical studies. Embodiments and examples described herein provide devices that support growth of physiologically relevant anisotropic muscle tissue in vitro, and include integrated electrical force sensors to allow electronic readout and quantification of the force generated by the tissue. Embodiments and examples described herein further provide devices and apparatuses for use in high throughput platforms for biomedical and pharmaceutical studies regarding the function of muscle tissue. Such devices enable high throughput screening, as well as long- term studies inside controlled incubator environments, which may include recapitulating physiologic extremes, such as hypoxic conditions. These muscle tissue layers are electrically functional and actively contractile, generating stresses comparable to those produced by whole papillary muscle, and the muscle tissue can be used to measure effects on muscle cell contractile function in vitro during electrical and pharmacological stimulation. The electrical readout employed by devices described herein further facilitates multiplexing of devices into multi-well format apparatuses including micro-titer plate formats and enables force sensing without need for optical recordings, thereby allow integration into microfluidic devices and enclosed recording setups. Some embodiments described herein provide a device for electrically measuring a contractile function of a muscle tissue layer. The device includes a flexible substrate that incorporates one or more strain- sensitive electrical elements and a tissue supporting layer on the flexible substrate configured to promote adherence and ingrowth of muscle cells. One or both of the flexible substrate and the tissue supporting layer are configured for anisotropic growth of muscle tissue to form an anisotropic tissue layer that can perform a contractile function adhered to the flexible substrate. Contraction of the muscle tissue layer causes strain in the flexible substrate and in the strain-sensitive electrical elements. If the mechanical properties of the flexible substrate are known, the contractile force exerted by the muscle tissue can be determined based on the strain measured in the flexible substrate. Devices described herein employ two different types of geometries for generation of strain in the flexible substrate. In the first type of geometry, the flexible substrate is supported at one end and free to deflect at the opposite end (e.g., like a cantilever). Contractile forces in the muscle tissue cause bending and out of plane deflection of the free end of the flexible substrate, which, in turn, causes strain in the flexible substrate that can be measured by the strain-sensitive electrical elements. In the second type of geometry, the flexible substrate is supported at both ends and the flexible substrate maintains a flat (not deflected) geometry. Given a flexible substrate with a sufficiently low modulus of elasticity, contractile forces in the muscle tissue cause measurable in-plane strain in the flexible substrate that can be measured by the strain-sensitive electrical elements. Figures 1A and IB schematically depict a device for measuring a contractile function of a muscle tissue layer in vitro that employs the first type of geometry in accordance with some embodiments. The device includes a flexible substrate including one or more strain- sensitive electrical elements. As shown in the exploded view of Figure IB, the flexible substrate can include a first polymer substrate layer, one or more strain- sensitive electrical elements, and a second polymer substrate layer at least partially overlying the one or more strain-sensitive electrical elements, in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, the flexible substrate may also include a hydro gel layer (e.g., gelatin) over the second polymer substrate layer. The device also includes a tissue supporting layer on the flexible substrate. The tissue supporting layer is configured to promote adherence and in growth of muscle cells. Further details regarding the tissue supporting layer and different configurations for the tissue supporting layer are described below with respect to Examples 1-3. One or both of the flexible substrate and the tissue supporting layer are configured for anisotropic growth of muscle tissue to form an anisotropic muscle tissue layer that can perform a contractile function adhered to the flexible substrate. Configuring the tissue supporting layer to achieve growth of an anisotropic muscle tissue layer is described below with respect to Example 1 and Example 2. Configuring the flexible support layer to achieve growth of an anisotropic muscle tissue layer is described below with respect to Example 3. In some embodiments, the device is provided without the muscle tissue layer and a user may seed the tissue supporting layer with cells, incubate the device, and grow the muscle tissue layer. In other embodiments, the device may be provided with the muscle tissue layer already grown. Figure 1A schematically illustrates how contraction of the anisotropic muscular tissue layer causes out of plane deflection at the free end of the flexible substrate. A contractile force in the muscle tissue layer causes the flexible substrate to bend in order to accommodate the stress created in the top muscle tissue layer. This bending causes different strains in different levels of the flexible substrate (e.g. , a stretching strain in the lower portion of the flexible substrate and a compressive strain in the upper portion of the flexible substrate). The strain sensitive element detects the strain present in the level of the flexible substrate in which it is located (e.g. , the strain in the portion of the thickness of the device in which it is located). The one or more strain-sensitive elements may produce a change in resistance, a generated voltage, a change in current, a change in capacitance, or a change in impedance based on strain in the device. The degree of bending in the flexible substrate, and the corresponding strain in the strain- sensitive electrical element, in response to the stress applied by the contracting muscle film layer depends on the thickness of the flexible substrate, the position of the strain- sensitive electrical element in the thickness of the flexible substrate, and the composite modulus of elasticity of the flexible substrate. For devices with the cantilever geometry, the acceptable range for the composite modulus of elasticity flexible substrate is relatively large (e.g. , 1 kPa to 100 GPa). Reductions in the thickness of the flexible substrate enable materials having a higher modulus of elasticity to be employed. To remain physiologically relevant, the modulus of elasticity of the flexible substrate should not be lowered below 1 kPa because formation of the muscle tissue layer requires the underlying substrate to have at least a certain amount of stiffness. Example 1 below details how contractile tissue stress is determined from a resistance change in a piezoresistive wire for a bending beam geometry. Figure 2 schematically depicts the second geometry for device embodiments. In this geometry, both ends of the flexible substrate are supported or fixed, preventing or greatly reducing any out of plane bending or deflection of the flexible substrate due to contractile force in the muscle tissue layer. Instead, contractile force in the muscle tissue layer cause in- plane strain in which the ends of the muscle tissue pull toward each other. In some embodiments, flexible substrate may remain attached to an underlying rigid substrate during measurements. In these embodiments, it is important that the composite modulus of elasticity of the flexible substrate is sufficiently small such that the force generated through tissue contraction can produce a measureable in-plane strain in the flexible substrate. However, the modulus of elasticity of the flexible substrate must be sufficiently large to support to support growth of the anisotropic tissue layer. For embodiments in which the muscle tissue layer is one to two cells thick, the magnitude of the stress generated by contraction of the muscle tissue layer is in the range 1 to 100 kPa, and for the planar geometry, the effective modulus of elasticity of the flexible substrate in a deformation zone (e.g., within 50 μιη of the tissue supporting layer) may be in the range of 1 kPa to 100 kPa. In embodiments in which the muscle tissue layer is more than two cells thick, the composite modulus of elasticity of the flexible substrate in the deformation can be greater because the contractile force generated by the muscle tissue layer is greater. In other embodiments, the flexible substrate may be free of an underlying rigid substrate and only supported at the ends (e.g. , like a membrane). In these embodiments, the modulus of elasticity of the flexible substrate may have values similar to those of the cantilever geometry embodiments. As noted above, different mechanisms may be employed for electrically sensing strain in the flexible substrate as a result of contractile forces in the muscle tissue layer. Figures 3A-3C depict cantilever geometry devices and planar geometry devices for sensing strain produced by the muscle tissue layers using different types of electrical sensing. In the devices depicted in Figure 3A, piezoresistive wire is used to sense strain in the flexible substrate due to contraction in the muscle tissue layer. Change in resistance in the piezoresistive wire has a known relationship to strain in the wire, which enables strain in the wire to be determined based on measured changes in resistance in the wire. Examples of piezoresistive materials that may be employed for the piezoresistive wire include, but are not limited to: titanium-gold or chromium-gold thin films, polymer (e.g. , poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) doped with conductive particles (e.g. , carbon nanoparticles), and doped silicon semiconductors. In the devices depicted in Figure 3B, the one or more strain-sensitive elements include piezoelectric elements positioned between electrodes. Strain on the piezoelectric elements, due to contraction of the muscle tissue layer generates a voltage across the piezoelectric elements, which can be measured using the electrodes. The piezoelectric elements may be particles, wires, plates or any other suitable configuration. Examples of piezoelectric materials that may be employed include, but are not limited to: piezoelectric polymers (e.g. , polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyvinyledenedifluoride-trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFe) co-polymers), inorganic piezoelectric materials (e.g. , zinc oxide (ZnO) and lead zirconium titanate (PZT)), and composites based on either class of materials. Any suitable conductive material may be used for the electrodes. In the devices depicted in Figure 3C, the one or more strain-sensitive elements include electrodes separated by an insulator forming a capacitor. The contraction of the muscle tissue layer causes both in-plane strain in the flexible substrate and an out of plane strain in the flexible substrate that changes the spacing of the electrodes, which changes the measured capacitance across the electrodes. This change in capacitance can be related to the out of plain strain, which, in turn, can be related to the stress and force generated by the muscle tissue layer. Any suitable conductive material may be used for the electrodes. Any suitable insulating materials may be used for the insulator. Types of integrated electrical sensors that may be employed as strain-sensitive elements in devices to detect contractile stress in muscle tissues include, but are not limited to: strain gauges, piezoresistive sensors, piezoelectric sensors, sensors based on changes in capacitance, and sensors based on inductance. These can be combined with integrated electrical recording of tissue action potential and propagation, e.g. , through flexible micro- electrode arrays integrated directly below the tissue support layer. Many different materials may be employed for strain- sensing elements and leads or contacts for the strain- sensing elements.

Sheets or scaffolds of aligned micron, submicron, or nanometer dimension polymeric fibers for use in the devices, constructs and methods of the invention comprise a plurality of fibers arrayed in substantially all the same direction (e.g., uniaxially aligned). In certain embodiments of the invention, the sheets or scaffolds of polymeric fibers may be mixtures of two or more polymers and/or two or more copolymers. In one embodiment the polymers may be a mixture of one or more polymers and or more copolymers. In another embodiment, the polymers for use in the devices and methods of the invention may be a mixture of one or more synthetic polymers and one or more naturally occurring polymers. The terms "fiber" and "polymeric fiber" are used herein interchangeably, and both terms refer to fibers having micron, submicron, and nanometer dimensions. Any suitable biogenic and/or non-biogenic polymer may be used to fabricate polymeric fiber sheets or scaffolds. Exemplary polymers for use in the devices, constructs, and methods of the invention may be biocompatible or non-biocompatible, synthetic or natural and those such as those that are synthetically designed to have shear induced unfolding. Suitable synthetic polymers include, for example, poly(urethanes), poly(siloxanes) or silicones, poly(ethylene), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate), poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(acrylic acid), polyacrylamide, poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), poly(ethylene glycol), poly(methacrylic acid), polylactides (PLA), polyglycolides (PGA), poly(lactide-co- glycolides) (PLGA), polyanhydrides, polyphosphazenes, polygermanes, polyorthoesters, polyesters, polyamides, polyolefins, polycarbonates, polyaramides, polyimides, copolymers and derivatives thereof, and combinations thereof.

In other embodiments, a biologically inert agent, e.g. , fluorescent beads, e.g. , fluorospheres, may be mixed with the polymer during the fabrication process. In yet another embodiment, polymers for use in the polymeric fibers of the invention are naturally occurring polymers, e.g. , biogenic polymers. Non-limiting examples of such naturally occurring polymers include, for example, polypeptides, proteins, e.g. , capable of fibrillogenesis, polysaccharides, e.g. , alginate, lipids, nucleic acid molecules, and combinations thereof. The muscle tissue layer support by exemplary devices may be any of vascular smooth muscle cells, vascular endothelial cells, myocytes (e.g., cardiac myocytes), skeletal muscle, myofibroblasts, airway smooth muscle cells and cells that will differentiate into contractile cells (e.g. , stem cells, e.g. , embryonic stem cells or adult stem cells, progenitor cells or satellite cells). These tissues may be based on human derived cells, e.g. induced pluripotent stem cells (IPS) or embryonic stem cells (ES), or from non-human animal sources including transgenic animals. The term "progenitor cell" is used herein to refer to cells that have a cellular phenotype that is more primitive (e.g., is at an earlier step along a developmental pathway or progression than is a fully differentiated cell) relative to a cell which it can give rise to by differentiation. Often, progenitor cells also have significant or very high proliferative potential. Progenitor cells can give rise to multiple distinct differentiated cell types or to a single differentiated cell type, depending on the developmental pathway and on the environment in which the cells develop and differentiate. The term "progenitor cell" is used herein synonymously with "stem cell." The term "stem cell" as used herein, refers to an undifferentiated cell which is capable of proliferation and giving rise to more progenitor cells having the ability to generate a large number of mother cells that can in turn give rise to differentiated, or differentiable daughter cells. The daughter cells themselves can be induced to proliferate and produce progeny that subsequently differentiate into one or more mature cell types, while also retaining one or more cells with parental developmental potential. The term "stem cell" refers to a subset of progenitors that have the capacity or potential, under particular circumstances, to differentiate to a more specialized or differentiated phenotype, and which retains the capacity, under certain circumstances, to proliferate without substantially differentiating. In one embodiment, the term stem cell refers generally to a naturally occurring mother cell whose descendants (progeny) specialize, often in different directions, by differentiation, e.g., by acquiring completely individual characters, as occurs in progressive diversification of embryonic cells and tissues. Cellular differentiation is a complex process typically occurring through many cell divisions. A differentiated cell may derive from a multipotent cell which itself is derived from a multipotent cell, and so on. While each of these multipotent cells may be considered stem cells, the range of cell types each can give rise to may vary considerably. Some differentiated cells also have the capacity to give rise to cells of greater developmental potential. Such capacity may be natural or may be induced artificially upon treatment with various factors. In many biological instances, stem cells are also "multipotent" because they can produce progeny of more than one distinct cell type, but this is not required for "sternness." Self-renewal is the other classical part of the stem cell definition. In theory, self- renewal can occur by either of two major mechanisms. Stem cells may divide asymmetrically, with one daughter retaining the stem state and the other daughter expressing some distinct other specific function and phenotype. Alternatively, some of the stem cells in a population can divide symmetrically into two stems, thus maintaining some stem cells in the population as a whole, while other cells in the population give rise to differentiated progeny only. Formally, it is possible that cells that begin as stem cells might proceed toward a differentiated phenotype, but then "reverse" and re-express the stem cell phenotype, a term often referred to as "dedifferentiation" or "reprogramming" or "retrodifferentiation". The term "embryonic stem cell" is used to refer to the pluripotent stem cells of the inner cell mass of the embryonic blastocyst (see US Patent Nos. 5,843,780, 6,200,806, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). Such cells can similarly be obtained from the inner cell mass of blastocysts derived from somatic cell nuclear transfer (see, for example, US Patent Nos. 5,945,577, 5,994,619, 6,235,970, which are incorporated herein by reference). The distinguishing characteristics of an embryonic stem cell define an embryonic stem cell phenotype. Accordingly, a cell has the phenotype of an embryonic stem cell if it possesses one or more of the unique characteristics of an embryonic stem cell such that that cell can be distinguished from other cells. Exemplary distinguishing embryonic stem cell characteristics include, without limitation, gene expression profile, proliferative capacity, differentiation capacity, karyotype, responsiveness to particular culture conditions, and the like. The term "adult stem cell" or "ASC" is used to refer to any multipotent stem cell derived from non- embryonic tissue, including fetal, juvenile, and adult tissue. Stem cells have been isolated from a wide variety of adult tissues including blood, bone marrow, brain, olfactory epithelium, skin, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle. Each of these stem cells can be characterized based on gene expression, factor responsiveness, and morphology in culture. Exemplary adult stem cells include neural stem cells, neural crest stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and pancreatic stem cells. In one embodiment, progenitor cells suitable for use in the claimed devices and methods are Committed Ventricular Progenitor (CVP) cells as described in PCT Application No. PCT/US09/060224, entitled "Tissue Engineered Mycocardium and Methods of Productions and Uses Thereof, filed September 28, 2009, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The tissue supporting layer includes molecules that support adhesion and ingrowth of seeded muscle tissues. Suitable molecules include, for example, extracellular matrix proteins (e.g., collagen, fibronectin, laminin, etc.); growth factors to direct cell function specific to cell type (e.g., nerve growth factor, bone morphogenic proteins, vascular endothelial growth factor, etc.); lipids, fatty acids and steroids (e.g., glycerides, non-glycerides, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol, corticosteroids, sex steroids, etc.); sugars and other biologically active carbohydrates (e.g., monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, sucrose, glucose, glycogen, etc.); combinations of carbohydrates, lipids and/or proteins, such as proteoglycans (protein cores with attached side chains of chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparin, heparan sulfate, and/or keratan sulfate); glycoproteins [e.g., selectins, immunoglobulins, hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin, Alphafetoprotein and Erythropoietin (EPO), etc.] ; proteolipids (e.g., N-myristoylated, palmitoylated and prenylated proteins); and glycolipids (e.g., glycoglycerolipids, glycosphingolipids, glycophosphatidylinositols, etc.); biologically derived homopolymers, such as polylactic and polyglycolic acids and poly-L-Iysine; nucleic acids (e.g., DNA, RNA, etc.); hormones (e.g., anabolic steroids, sex hormones, insulin, angiotensin, etc.); enzymes (types: oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases; examples: trypsin, collegenases, matrix metallproteinases, etc.); pharmaceuticals (e.g., beta blockers, vasodilators, vasoconstrictors, pain relievers, gene therapy, viral vectors, anti-inflammatories, etc.); cell surface ligands and receptors (e.g., integrins, selectins, cadherins, etc.); cytoskeletal filaments and/or motor proteins (e.g., intermediate filaments, microtubules, actin filaments, dynein, kinesin, myosin, etc.); and hydrophylic polymers (e.g., polyethylene oxide or pluronics). Any appropriate cell culture method may be used to establish the tissue. The seeding density of the cells will vary depending on the cell size and cell type, but can easily be determined by methods known in the art. For example, the cells may be cultured in suitable media in an incubator under physiologic conditions (e.g., at 37°C) until the cells form a tissue. Anisotropic muscular tissues ranging from monolayer muscular thin films to multilayer 3-dimensional tissue, can be generated through (bio)-chemical, mechanical or structural cues or a combination of these as described below. Figures 4A-4C illustrate different options for directing development of anisotropic muscle tissue. In some embodiments, the tissue supporting layer includes chemical cues for development of anisotropic muscle tissue as shown in Figure 4A. In such embodiments, the resulting tissue layer is typically only a single cell thick. Chemical cues that may be employed include, but are not limited to patterned proteins (e.g. , fibronectin, collagen, or laminin), peptides or sugars to induce cellular binding and spreading, and polymers to limit spreading in defined areas using (e.g. pluronic, polyethylene glycol (PEG), poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (PMOXA), and similar polymers). Patterning of such chemical cues can be achieved by a variety of different techniques, such as micro-contact printing, micromolding, screen and roll printing, direct ink printing, 3D printing, ink-jet printing, and UV induced patterning (e.g. , stereo lithography). Example 1 described below describes a tissue support layer incorporating chemical cues for development of anisotropic muscle tissue. In some embodiments, the tissue support layer itself incorporates a sheet of micron, submicron, and/or nanometer dimension fibers oriented in substantially the same direction forming a fiber scaffold to structurally direct anisotropic muscle tissue growth as shown in Figure 4C. In such embodiments, the thickness of the muscle tissue layer depends on the thickness of the sheet of fibers. The muscle tissue layer could be a single cell thick or many cells thick. The muscle tissue layer can be between 10- 100 microns thick, with the upper limit being set by diffusion of nutrients through the thickness of the muscle tissue layer. Fibrous sheets for cells scaffolds may be produced using multiple different techniques that include, but are not limited to: rotary jet spinning, electrospinning, immersed rotary jet spinning, and pull spinning. Because substantially all of the fibers are aligned in same direction, the ingrown tissue cells develop with a similar anisotropy. Sheets of fibers may be employed to produce both two dimensional (e.g. , single cells thick layers) and three dimensional engineered tissue samples. Example 2 below describes devices that incorporates a sheet of micron, submicron and/or nanometer dimension fibers to direct anisotropic muscle tissue growth. Additional details regarding formation of the fibers sheets are described below in the section entitled "Fiber Sheets for Tissue Supporting Layer." In other embodiments, the tissue supporting layer may include a cell scaffold of porous hydrogel or elastomer. In some embodiments, the flexible substrate remains attached to and supported by a relatively rigid substrate during growth and development of the muscle layer. This is important because the cells require not only the spatial cues provided by the patterned chemical cues, structural cues, or fiber sheets, but also benefit from the relative inflexibility provided by the rigid substrate during culturing to prevent movement of the cells during growth and development in order to form a functional tissue. In the absence of these restrictions, the cells may not organize relative to the cues provided by the patterned chemical cues, structural cues, or fiber sheets and may not be held in place for a sufficient period of time in order for the cells to properly organize, differentiate, and mature into functional two- dimensional tissue as they would in an in vivo environment. Further, if there is prestress in the flexible substrate, the flexible substrate may need to remain attached to the rigid substrate during development of the muscle tissue. In some embodiments, attachment to the underlying rigid substrate may not be needed for development of the muscle tissue layer and the flexible substrate may be released from the underlying rigid substrate prior to growth and development of the tissue layer. In some embodiments, a top surface of the flexible substrate has a shape that structurally directs anisotropic muscle tissue growth as shown in Figure 4B. Structural cues can be generated in a top surface of the flexible substrate, which may comprise a hydrogel or an elastomer, by additive or subtractive techniques. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, imprint and molding techniques, photolithographic techniques, lithographically directed etching, UV-induced crosslinking polymerization or vapor polymerization, spray coating deposition, screen and roll-to-roll deposition, laser cutting and crosslinking techniques, direct- ink printing, 3D-printing and ink jet printing. In some embodiments, mechanical cues can be achieved by locally patterned stiffness, in addition to, or as opposed to locally patterned shape. Such patterned stiffness may be achieved through differences in crosslinking of degree of elastomeric substrates, or localized differences in solid content of a hydrogel material. Fiber Sheets for Tissue Supporting Layer In some embodiments, suitable devices for fabricating the micron, submicron or nanometer dimension polymeric fibers include a reservoir for holding a polymer, the reservoir including one or more orifices for ejecting the polymer during fiber formation, thereby forming a micron, submicron or nanometer dimension polymeric fiber and a collection device for accepting the formed micron, submicron or nanometer dimension polymeric fiber, wherein at least one of the reservoir and the collection device employs rotational motion during fiber formation, and the device is free of an electrical field, e.g., a high voltage electrical field. The device may include a rotary motion generator for imparting a rotational motion to the reservoir and, in some exemplary embodiments, to the collection device. In some embodiments, a flexible air foil is attached to a shaft of the motor above the reservoir to facilitate fiber collection and solvent evaporation. Rotational speeds of the reservoir in exemplary embodiments may range from about 1,000 rpm-60,000 rpm, about 1,000 rpm-50,000 rpm, about 1,000 rpm to about 40,000 rpm, about 1,000 rpm-30,000 rpm, about 1,000 rpm to about 20,000 rpm, about 1,000 rpm- 10,000 rpm, about 5,000 rpm-60,000 rpm, about 5,000 rpm-50,000 rpm, about 5,000 rpm to about 40,000 rpm, about 5,000 rpm-30,000 rpm, about 5,000 rpm-20,000 rpm, about 5,000 rpm to about 15,000 rpm, about 5,000 rpm-10,000 rpm, about 10,000 rpm-60,000 rpm, about 10,000 rpm-50,000 rpm, about 10,000 rpm to about 40,000 rpm, about 10,000 rpm-30,000 rpm, about 10,000 rpm-20,000 rpm, about 10,000 rpm to about 15,000 rpm, about 20,000 rpm- 60,000 rpm, about 20,000 rpm-50,000 rpm, about 20,000 rpm to about 40,000 rpm, about 20,000 rpm-30,000 rpm, or about 50,000 rpm to about 400,000 rpm, e.g. , about 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500, 3,000, 3,500, 4,000, 4,500, 5,000, 5,500, 6,000, 6,500, 7,000, 7,500, 8,000, 8,500, 9,000, 9,500, 10,000, 10,500, 11,000, 11,500, 12,000, 12,500, 13,000, 13,500, 14,000, 14,500, 15,000, 15,500, 16,000, 16,500, 17,000, 17,500, 18,000, 18,500, 19,000, 19,500, 20,000, 20,500, 21,000, 21,500, 22,000, 22,500, 23,000, 23,500, 24,000, 25,000, 26,000, 27,000, 28,000, 29,000, 30,000, 31,000, 32,000, 33,000, 34,000, 35,000, 36,000, 37,000, 38,000, 39,000, 40,000, 41,000, 42,000, 43,000, 44,000, 45,000, 46,000, 47,000, 48,000, 49,000, 50,000, 55,000, 60,000, 65,000, 70,000, 75,000, 80,000, 85,000, 90,000, 95,000, 100,000, 105,000, 110,000, 115,000, 120,000, 125,000, 130,000, 135,000, 140,000, 145,000, 150,000 rpm, about 200,000 rpm, 250,000 rpm, 300,000 rpm, 350,000 rpm, or 400,000 rpm. Ranges and values intermediate to the above recited ranges and values are also contemplated to be part of the invention. In certain embodiments, rotating speeds of about 50,000 rpm-400,000 rpm are intended to be encompassed by the methods of the invention.

Exemplary devices employing rotational motion may be rotated for a time sufficient to form a desired polymeric fiber, such as, for example, about 1 minute to about 100 minutes, about 1 minute to about 60 minutes, about 10 minutes to about 60 minutes, about 30 minutes to about 60 minutes, about 1 minute to about 30 minutes, about 20 minutes to about 50 minutes, about 5 minutes to about 20 minutes, about 5 minutes to about 30 minutes, or about 15 minutes to about 30 minutes, about 5-100 minutes, about 10-100 minutes, about 20-100 minutes, about 30-100 minutes, or about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 minutes, or more. Times and ranges intermediate to the above- recited values are also intended to be part of this invention. In some embodiments, the reservoir may not be rotated, but may be pressurized to eject the polymer material from the reservoir through one or more orifices. For example, a mechanical pressurizer may be applied to one or more surfaces of the reservoir to decrease the volume of the reservoir, and thereby eject the material from the reservoir. In another exemplary embodiment, a fluid pressure may be introduced into the reservoir to pressurize the internal volume of the reservoir, and thereby eject the material from the reservoir. An exemplary reservoir may have a volume ranging from about one nanoliter to about 1 milliliter, about one nanoliter to about 5 milliliters, about 1 nanoliter to about 100 milliliters, or about one microliter to about 100 milliliters, for holding the liquid material. Some exemplary volumes include, but are not limited to, about one nanoliter to about 1 milliliter, about one nanoliter to about 5 milliliters, about 1 nanoliter to about 100 milliliters, one microliter to about 100 microliters, about 1 milliliter to about 20 milliliters, about 20 milliliters to about 40 milliliters, about 40 milliliters to about 60 milliliters, about 60 milliliters to about 80 milliliters, about 80 milliliters to about 100 milliliters, but are not limited to these exemplary ranges. Exemplary volumes intermediate to the recited volumes are also part of the invention. In certain embodiment, the volume of the reservoir is less than about 5, less than about 4, less than about 3, less than about 2, or less than about 1 milliliter. In other embodiments, the physical size of an unfolded polymer and the desired number of polymers that will form a fiber dictate the smallest volume of the reservoir. In one embodiment, a polymer is fed into a reservoir as a polymer solution, i.e., a polymer dissolved in an appropriate solution. In this embodiment, the methods may further comprise dissolving the polymer in a solvent prior to feeding the polymer into the reservoir. In other embodiments, a polymer is fed into the reservoir as a polymer melt. In such embodiment, the reservoir is heated at a temperature suitable for melting the polymer, e.g., is heated at a temperature of about 100°C to about 300°C, 100-200°C, about 150-300°C, about 150-250°C, or about 150-200°C, or about 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 200, 205, 210, 215, 220, 225, 230, 235, 240, 245, 250, 255, 260, 265, 270, 275, 280, 285, 290, 295, or about 300°C.

Speeds intermediate to the above recited speeds are also contemplated to be part of the invention. An exemplary rotating structure may be rotated to impact the liquid material for a time sufficient to form a desired fiber, such as, for example, about 1 minute to about 100 minutes, about 1 minute to about 60 minutes, about 10 minutes to about 60 minutes, about 30 minutes to about 60 minutes, about 1 minute to about 30 minutes, about 20 minutes to about 50 minutes, about 5 minutes to about 20 minutes, about 5 minutes to about 30 minutes, or about 15 minutes to about 30 minutes, about 5-100 minutes, about 10-100 minutes, about 20- 100 minutes, about 30-100 minutes, or about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 minutes, or more. Times and ranges intermediate to the above-recited values are also intended to be part of this invention. The one or more portions or components of the rotating structure may penetrate into the surface of the liquid material to a desired depth. Exemplary depths of penetration may range from about one nanometer to about one centimeter, but are not limited to this range. Some exemplary penetration depths include, but are not limited to, about one millimeter to about twenty milliliters, about twenty milliliters to about forty milliliters, about forty milliliters to about sixty milliliters, about sixty milliliters to about eighty milliliters, about eighty milliliters to about one hundred milliliters, about one centimeter, and the like. Exemplary penetration depths intermediate to the above-recited exemplary values are also intended to be part of this invention. The rotating structure may be configured in any suitable manner so that, upon rotation, the rotating structure contacts a surface of the liquid material on platform to impart sufficient force or energy to create a meniscus at the location where the rotating structure contacts the surface. The force or energy imparted by the rotating structure overcomes the surface tension and decouples a portion of the liquid material at the meniscus and flings the portion away from the contact with the rotating structure and from the platform, thereby forming a micron, submicron and/or nanometer dimension fiber. The fiber may be collected on the collection device. In an exemplary embodiment, the direction in which the liquid material is flung may be substantially the same as the tangential direction of motion of the component of the rotating structure that contacts the liquid material. In an exemplary embodiment, the rotating structure may impart a force to the liquid material in a substantially parallel direction to the top surface of the liquid material. In one embodiment, the rotating structure may have a central core rotatable in a clockwise and/or counter-clockwise manner about a central axis of rotation R. In an exemplary embodiment, the rotational axis R may be offset at substantially 90 degrees from the vertical axis V. The core may have a substantially cylindrical shape with a substantially circular cross-section having a center aligned along the axis of rotation R. The rotating structure may also include one or more protrusions, e.g. , in the form of blades, brushes, bristles, etc., affixed to the outer surface of the rotating core so that part of the protrusions penetrate into the surface of the liquid material. Exemplary rotating structures may include any suitable number of protrusions affixed to the core including, but not limited to, one protrusion to 500 protrusions. Some exemplary numbers of protrusions include, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, about 50 to about 100, about 100 to about 200, about 200 to about 300, about 300 to about 400, about 400 to about 500, and the like. Exemplary numbers of protrusions intermediate to the recited exemplary numbers are also part of the invention. The protrusions may be configured on the core in any suitable arrangement including, but not limited to, a regular multi-row or multi-column arrangement, an array pattern, a circular arrangement, a random arrangement, and the like. Each protrusion may have any suitable shape including, but not limited to, a substantially rectangular shaped protrusion, a saw shaped protrusion wherein the base of the protrusion at the core is wider than the tip farthest from the core, a cylindrical shaped protrusion, and the like. At high rotational speeds and/or in instances where broken protrusions would compromise the purity of the fibers, the saw shape may provide enhanced structural integrity to the protrusions and may prevent break-off of the protrusions during rotation. In some exemplary embodiments, one or more aspects of the protrusions on the rotating structure may be varied to control the adherence of the liquid material to the protrusions when the liquid material comes into contact with the protrusions, thereby facilitating fiber formation. Exemplary aspects that may be control or configured include, but are not limited to, the surface chemistry of the protrusions, the surface topography of the protrusions (e.g. , a rougher texture), a geometry of the protrusions (e.g. , a cross-sectional shape of the protrusions), and the like. In addition, configuring these aspects of the protrusions may allow controlling the geometry of the fibers that are formed, fiber width, surface features on the fibers, and the like. Exemplary protrusions may be formed of any suitable material including, but not limited to, titanium, stainless steel (e.g. , 300 and 400 alloys), aluminum (e.g. , 6061, 7075), polystyrene, polypropylene, (e.g. , UHMW, HDPE, LDPE), ABS, acetal (copolymer and homopolymer), nylon, polycarbonate, polyether ether ketone, polymethyl methacrylate, polysulfone, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride, and the like. Any suitable size or geometrically shaped reservoir or collector may be used for fabricating polymeric fibers. In some embodiments, the fibers may be produced by electro spinning or other suitable techniques known to those in the art. Example 1 - Muscular Tissue Piezoresistive Strain Gauge Device with Micropatterned Chemical Cues and Multiplexed Apparatus A cantilever geometry device for measuring a contractile function of a muscle tissue layer that employed a pieozoresistive stretchable metal nanofilm wire embedded in a polymer flexible substrate, specifically polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), was produced . The tissue supporting layer of the device employed micropatterned chemical cues, specifically micro- contact printed ^CP) fibronectin (FN), for promoting anisotropic growth of the muscle tissue layer. The strain-sensitive element employed was a stretchable piezoresistive micro- cracked gold thin film. Figure 5 schematically depicts an exploded perspective view of the device. An eight- well apparatus was also produced based on this device design, with each well including an independent device and an associated half Wheatstone bridge enabling resistance changes to be recorded as voltage changes. Figure 6A shows the multiplexed apparatus incorporating eight independent devices each including an integrated half Wheatstone bridge for measuring a change in resistance as a change in voltage. Figure 6B is an image of the multiplexed apparatus after addition of eight wells with each well associated with a corresponding independent device. Figure 6C shows the multiplexed apparatus in a holder incorporating electrical contacts to leads for each independent device. The holder was used for recording from the eight- well apparatus inside an incubator. Fabrication A 2" x 3" glass slide served as a rigid substrate for formation of the devices. Poly(N- isopropylacrylamide) (pnipaam) thin film islands served as a sacrificial release layer between the rigid substrate and the flexible substrate. The pnipaam thin film islands were made by spin coating or printing pnipaam solution in 1-butanol or iso-priponal onto the rigid substrate. Alternatively, other water-soluble polymers such as dextran or sucrose could have been employed for the sacrificial layer (also referred to herein as the release layer). A first polymer substrate layer in the form of a 3-4 μιη thick SYLGARD 184 PDMS film was spin coated onto the rigid substrate over the release layer. (SYLGARD is a registered trademark of Dow Corning Corporation.) Thermal or e-beam evaporated titanium-gold or chromium-gold thin films on PDMS substrates spontaneously develop micro-wrinkled or micro-cracked films. The specific micro structure can be controlled through the thickness of the Ti or Cr adhesion layer. A thin film of Ti-Au-Ti was evaporated onto the first polymer layer with nominal thicknesses 3 nm Ti, 20 nm Au, 1 nm Ti, using a custom-made shadow mask to define a wire pattern for each device. After evaporation, prestresses in the metal wires were released by heat-treatment at 190 C for 30-50 min. A second polymer substrate layer in the form of a 25 um PDMS film was spin coated on the substrate over the wires and over the first polymer substrate layer. After curing, separate cantilevers were cut in the PDMS using a C02 laser. The PDMS polymer substrate layers had an elastic modulus of about 1.5 MPa. A tissue supporting layer was formed on each device in the form of a pattern of 15 μιη wide lines of fibronectin spaced by 2-4 μιη for each device, which was transferred to the substrate using micro-contact printing. Figure 6A shows the eight devices. Laser cut plastics or cast PDMS wells were used to contain cell medium {see Figure 6B). Figure 7 schematically illustrates the patterns used for various steps for the design of the eight well apparatus. Laser cuts in the PDMS and a PNIPAAM release layer below the sensor enabled for the fabrication of cantilevers. The wire layout facilitates Wheatstone bridge measurements of the resistance change, and concurrent control for temperature changes. After placement of the wells, neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) were seeded at a concentration of 0.3 Mio cells per ml medium, and the contraction of the resulting muscle tissue layers was tested on day 4-5 after seeding. Prior to testing, the cantilevers were released by lowering the sample temperature to room temperature to dissolve the pnipaam sacrificial layer, meaning that the flexible substrate cantilevers were released from the underlying rigid glass substrate after development and growth of the tissue. The custom holder shown in Figure 6C allowed in-line in incubator studies of tissue contraction. Stress in the overlying muscle tissue layer due to contraction can be determined from measured changes in resistance in the piezoelectric wire. Figure 8 schematically depicts the various parameters used for relating the change in resistance to change in the stress in the muscle tissue layer. The following equations can be used to relate change in resistance of the wire to stress in the muscle tissue film using the parameters. [Note: The equations below will be replaced by the equations appearing in the new version of Figure 8 provided by Johan] The strain is described by the following equation Fl. The stress is related to the strain by the following equation F2. σ = Εε The resistance change in in the wire is described by the following equation F3. The following equation F4 describes the normal force in the muscle tissue layer being balanced by the total normal force through le substrate. ha, tissue = 0 The following equation F5 describes the angular momentum in the muscle tissue layer being balanced by the total angular momentum throughout the flexible substrate. = 0 In the equations above, ε(ζ) is the strain at a distance (z) from the surface of the flexible substrate, σ is the stress, E is the elastic modulus, b is the z value of the neutral axis (i.e. , where the beam is not under compressive or tensile stress), zWire is the z value at the wire, RC is the radius of curvature at the neutral axis, GF is the gauge factor of the wire, h is the thickness of the tissue, t is the thickness of the flexible substrate, RQ° is the unstrained resistance, and AR° is the change in resistance. The following modified Stoney' s equation ma be employed for calculating the radius of curvature: where ztop zbottom layer 2 CB = * * {ztop - Z, bottom layer cc = * ^ * ( ztop zbottom layer and the placement of the neutral axis is given by (CA— h.2 * otissue * -^j cB For this design, the further the distance between the neutral axis and the wire (i.e. , the larger the value of zWire-b) the larger the strain signal. Thus, for a given total thickness of the flexible substrate, the smaller the thickness of the first polymer substrate layer, the greater the strain signal. Development of Ti-Au-Ti Piezoelectric Wires The inventors explored various thicknesses of titanium and gold layers for the Ti-Au- Ti piezoelectric sensors. Unexpectedly, the inventors realized that thicknesses of titanium and gold layers that produce functional and reliable piezoelectric wires on relatively thick PDMS layers (e.g. , a 1 mm thick PDMS layer) did not produce functional and reliable piezoelectric wires on substantially thinner PDMS layers. The inventors discovered that the thickness of the applied titanium adhesion layer drives the morphology of the overlying gold film for relatively thin PDMS layers (e.g. , about 100 nm thick or less). Figure 9 includes images that illustrate the effect of titanium adhesion layer thickness on the macroscopic (A) and microscopic (B) structures of the resulting gold film layers when deposited on 65 μιη PDMS layers. E-beam evaporation was used to deposit 4 x 4 mm squares of 3, 5, and 7 nm thick titanium adhesion layers followed by 20 nm thick gold layers on a 65 μιη thick PDMS layer overlying a glass support. The upper photographic images (A) showed macroscopic crack development (indicated by the arrows) for the 5 nm and 7 nm titanium adhesion layers. Such macroscopic cracks often lead to defects in piezoelectric wires made from these materials. Notably these macroscopic crack defects are not observed for the thinner 3 nm titanium adhesion layers. The lower scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (B) of the gold films show the micro-cracked structure in gold film on the 3 nm thick titanium adhesion layer. For gold films on 5 nm thick and thicker titanium adhesion layers, micro-wrinkled and continuous films are observed. It is possible that the microcracking of the gold layer on 3 nm titanium on the 65 μιη thick PDMS layer, as opposed to microwrinkling of gold on 4 nm thick and 5 nm thick, relieves sufficient stress to prevent macroscopic crack defect formation. The microstructures appeared to be largely independent of the thickness of the gold films. On very thick PDMS layers (e.g. , 1 mm thick) no macroscopic defects in gold layers were observed for 3 nm, 4 nm or 5 nm thick titanium adhesion layers; however, such PDMS layers are too thick to be employed in embodiments. As explained above, the strength of the strain signal is inversely proportional to the thickness of the first polymer substrate layer on which the wire is deposited. As such, it is desirable to deposit the wire on thinner PDMS layers to increase the strain signal. The process of depositing the wires creates prestress in the wires. To visualize this prestress during development of the process after deposition of the wires, the underlying PDMS layer was cut into a cantilever and was released from the rigid substrate. Bending of the cantilever evidenced the prestress in the wire. Figure 10 includes images of the cantilever without annealing and after annealing for various amounts of time. The cantilevers shown in Figure 10 included a 4 μιη thick PDMS bottom layer (the first polymer substrate layer), with a 3 nm titanium adhesion layer, a 20 nm gold layer and a 1 nm titanium layer wire deposited on the PDMS bottom layer, and a 25 μιη thick PDMS top layer (the second polymer substrate layer) deposited over the wire and the PDMS bottom layer. The image labeled "no extra heat" shows bending of the cantilever due to prestress. The image labeled "15 minutes" shows the reduced bending of the cantilever after annealing of the cantilever at 190 C for 15 minutes. The image labeled "50 minutes" shows that the cantilever no longer appears bent indicating full relaxation of the prestress after annealing of the cantilever at 190 C for 15 minutes. The image labeled "4 hours" shows that further annealing of the cantilever past 50 minutes to 4 hours did not seem to have any effect on the prestress as all prestress was relaxed after 50 minutes. The pre-stress in the cantilevers can be released by mild annealing at 190 C for 30-50 min. The scanning electron microscopy images of the wires showed that the annealing seemed to expand the micro-crack structure. Resulting wires based on microcracked Ti-Au-Ti layers showed substantial elasticity. Bulk gold exhibits can be strained less than 1% prior to failure. However, the piezoelectric wires were cyclically strained 10% without failure. The resulting wires also exhibited a semi-linear strain relationship. The piezoelectric behavior of wires of 3 nm Ti, 20 nm gold and 1 nm titanium deposited on 4 μ PDMS was tested using a machine, specifically a machine by INSTRON, that applies selected strains to materials. Figures 1 lA-1 ID show the resistance of the wires as a function of time when subjected to cycling straining of different magnitudes and different frequencies. In the low strain regime (e.g. , below 1%) at relevant physiological frequencies (e.g. , on the order of 1 Hz), the wires showed semi-linear strain- resistance relationship and that wire can (see Figure 11A and Figure 1 IB). The results also demonstrated that the wires could be repeatedly strained by at least 10% without failure (see Figure 11C). Measurements As noted above, measurements were made of muscle tissue layers of NVRM muscle cells on the devices in the multiplexed apparatus. Figures 12A and 12B show measurements of resistance versus time evidencing spontaneous beating of the NVRM cells in the incubator. As shown in Figure 12B, after addition of 10 μΜ isoproterenol, the spontaneous beating frequency of the cells significantly increased, providing proof of principle for use of the apparatus for measuring the effect of drugs on the function of muscle tissue layers. Tracking of cantilever deflection in devices via changes in resistance was compared to optical tracking of cantilever deflection. Figure 13A is an image illustrating how optical tracking can be employed to measure cantilever deflection. An optical imaging device is set up with a planar view of cantilever device. As the device deflects in response to stress in the cantilever, the apparent cantilever length {i.e., the projection of the cantilever onto the plane of the substrate) shortens. Measuring the apparent length of the cantilever provides a measurement of the radius of curvature of the cantilever according to the following equations which are illustrated in part B of Figure For 2Un < R and for R < 2 R0 = x where Rois the radius of curvature, x is the projection onto the substrate and L is the cantilever length. The radius of curvature of the cantilever can be related to the stress in the muscle tissue layer through the equations in part (A) of Figure 8. Other methods of planar optical measurement of cantilever deflection may be found in WO2010/0127280. Figure 13B is a graph of stress versus time showing that both optical tracking of deflection of the cantilever (light gray) and tracking changes (dark gray) showed similar results. Example 2 - Fiber Guided Anisotropic Muscular Tissue Piezoresistive Strain Gauge Device with Micropatterned Chemical Cues and Multiplexed Apparatus A cantilever geometry device for measuring a contractile function of a muscle tissue layer that employed a pieozoresistive stretchable metal nanofilm wire embedded in a PDMS flexible substrate with fiber guided anisotropic tissue growth was produced. The tissue supporting layer employed a fiber construct to guide development of single layer to multilayer anisotropic muscle tissue. The device was similar to that of Example 1, except that instead of employing micropatterned chemical cues for anisotropic tissue growth, a fiber construct in the form of a sheet of fibers guided anisotropic tissue development. Figure 14A schematically depicts the design of the device and Figure 14B is an image of devices with the tissue supporting sheet of fibers attached. Fabrication Device fabrication similar to that described above for Example 1 ; however, after curing of the top PDMS layer (the second polymer substrate layer) at 65 C for one hour, a, a sheet of pull-spun polycaprolactone (PCL):gelatin fibers was transferred onto the flexible substrate and the PDMS was subsequently allowed to cure at room temperature. By controlling sheet thickness, thickness of tissue construct can be controlled. The ratio of PCL to gelatin was 4: 1 by weight for the fibers. The individual fibers had a diameter of about 500 nm to 1 μιη. However, in other embodiments the fibers could have a diameter in the range of 50 nm to 50 μιη. Pull spinning was used for fabrication of fibrous scaffold as the technique was found to give optimal fiber alignment in combination with control of scaffold thickness as compared to rotary jet spinning. Figure 15A is an image of the PCL:gelatin fiber sheet that is pull spun onto an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene backing layer. The fiber sheets were about 25 μιη thick. However, in other embodiments, fiber sheets could have a thickness anywhere in the range of 1 μιη to 200 μιη thick. NVRM cells were grown into anisotropic muscle tissue layers on the devices. Figure 15B is an image of NVRM anisotropic tissue that grew into the fiber sheet of a device. Cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells were also grown into anisotropic muscle tissue layers on the devices. After the muscle tissue was grown the sacrificial release layer was removed to free the cantilever for each device. Results Figure 16A includes images of the device showing deflection due to forces exerted by the ingrown muscle tissue layer. Figure 16B is a graph of showing a record of the spontaneous contraction of NVRM tissue on the cantilever with the fiber sheet as a tissue supporting layer. The fibrous scaffolds supported development of thicker anisotropic muscular constructs than monolayers of cells. The applied constructs were furthermore found to support long term in vivo culture of NRVM based tissues over at least several weeks. Additionally, the scaffolds supported development of tissue based on cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, which display no delamination, a problem frequently observed for muscular thin film tissue based e.g. on micro-contact printed fibronectin. Example 3 - Fully 3D Printed Groove-Guided Muscle Tissue Layer Strain Gauge Device A cantilever geometry device that can be fully 3D printed and employs tissue guiding micron scale grooves in a top surface of the flexible substrate is described. To determine the effectiveness of micro-grooves in the flexible substrate for formation and development of anisotropic muscle tissue, direct ink written microgrooved patterns of PDMS were formed on the top surface of a polymer substrate layer, and tissue development and growth was evaluated for the microgrooved patterns. Fabrication Fabrication of the devices is by sequential direct ink writing of each layer using a 3D printer. Figure 17 shows the different layers of a single device. Multiple devices can be produced using the 3D printer in the form of a multiplexed, multiwell apparatus. The inks used for writing the device should be selected for writing features at relevant length scales, as well as to give appropriate mechanical and electrical properties to the final device. A 2" x 3" glass slide serves as substrate for the device using a custom print code. A release layer (e.g., 10wt dextran in 1 :9 isopropanokwater) is written on the substrate. For biocompatible water soluble polymers used for sacrificial release layers, addition of a solvent such as isopropanol break solution surface tension in order to allow printing of the water soluble thin films. The first polymer substrate layer is written over the release layer and the substrate. The first polymer substrate layer may be any suitable polymer in any suitable solvent (e.g. , PDMS (SYLGARD 184), which may be in a solvent). The patterned strain sensing wire is written over the first polymer substrate layer. The patterned strain sensing wire may be a conducting micro or nano particle doped polymer in a suitable solvent (e.g. , 20wt carbon black particles in PDMS (DOW CORNING SE 1700) in decane). Conductive leads (e.g., conductive silver ink from Voxel8 Inc.) may also be written. For the printed leads, metal particle doped polymers are more conducting that their carbon black counterpart for similar loading volumes. For the part of the device that is not deformed by the cells, a mechanically robust and high conductivity printable composite is ideal. The second polymer substrate layer is written over the patterned strain sensing wire and the first polymer substrate layer. The second polymer layer may be any suitable polymer in any suitable solvent (e.g. , PDMS (SYLGARD 184), which may be in a solvent). Cell aligning grooves are written on the second polymer layer using any suitable polymer (e.g. , DOW Corning SE: 1700 PDMS). Wells are also direct ink written over the devices using any suitable polymer (e.g., DOW Corning SE: 1700 PDMS mixed 5: 1 with SYLGARD 184 PDMS). The devices are incubated with fibronectin and subsequently seeded with NVRM cells. If the release layer is water soluble (e.g., dextran), the liquid medium used for NRVM cell seeding dissolves the sacrificial layers, releasing the cantilevers prior to growth and development of the muscle tissue layers. For the cell aligning grooves: DOW Corning SE: 1700 PDMS 1 :25 curing agent: base gives a MPa range stiffness of the cured material. This highly viscous and shear-thinning PDMS enabled printing high aspect ratio tissue-aligning structures. For purposes of evaluating the effect of microgroove properties on anisotropic tissue growth, PDMS lines were written onto an underlying polymer layer. Fabrication of the PDMS microgrooved surface was by direct ink writing of PDMS lines on the polymer layer using a 3D printer. The cell aligning grooves were written from DOW Corning SE: 1700 PDMS mixed with 5: 1 SYLGARD 184 PDMS with both mixtures having a ratio of 1 : 10 of curing agent: base. Figure 18 shows the direct ink writing of the PDMS microgrooves using a 3D printer employing a 30 μιη diameter writing tip. For the cell aligning grooves: DOW Corning SE: 1700 PDMS 1 :25 curing agent: base gives a MPa range stiffness of the cured material. This highly viscous and shear-thinning PDMS enabled printing high aspect ratio tissue-aligning structures. The microgrooved surfaces were incubated with fibronectin and then seeded with NRVM cells. Results Figure 19 shows how the groove spacing affected the resulting profile of the top surface for PDMS lines written with a 30 μιη diameter writing tip. A groove spacing of 40 μιη produced only shallow grooves with a hill to valley height of less than 5 μιη. A groove spacing of 100 μιη produced hills separated by wide flat valleys. For the 30 μιη diameter writing tip, a 50 μιη to 60 μιη groove spacing produced grooves with a hill to valley height of about 10 μιη to 15 μιη. Figures 20A and 20B are confocal images of immunostained anisotropic NRVM tissue developed on microgrooved PDMS structures. As additional cells were added, the tissue layer thickened in the valleys of the grooves as shown in the side view of Figure 20A. The quality of the anisotropic tissue layer grown on the devices was a function of groove spacing and groove structure. As shown in Figure 20A, highly aligned tissue, as indicated by highly aligned sarcomeres, was achieved using a groove spacing of 50 μιη. In contrast, the tissue on microgrooves with a spacing of 40 μιη did not show alignment, likely due to this spacing creating only shallow grooves (e.g. , less than 5 μιη) for lines written with a 30 μιη diameter writing tip (see Figure 20B). The tissues on microgrooves with a spacing of 100 μιη was low quality as the gap was too wide to be spanned by the tissues (see Figure 20B). For the 30 μιη writing tip, a 50 μιη to 60 μιη groove spacing seemed to produce the best results for anisotropic tissue layer development. As shown in Figures 21 A and 2 IB, application of voltage sensitive dye and optical mapping confirmed the electrical anisotropy of tissue guided by the direct ink written micro- grooves, as indicated by anisotropic conduction velocity of action potential. Example 4 - Planar Sensor Fabrication Due to the 1- 100 kPa required effective stiffness of the flexible substrate in the deformation zone (e.g. , within 50 μιη of the tissue layer) in the planar geometry, only a subset of the suggested wire materials are applicable in this layout. Wire materials based on percolating networks of particles, either in the form of composites or as discontinuous sheets, as well as conductive inks/liquids, are of thus of special relevance for the planar configuration. In the case of particle-based conductors, one fabrication route includes a suspension of conducting particles, such as carbon nanotubes (CNT), carbon black (CB), gold nanoparticles or similar, is locally ink-jet printed or direct-ink written 3D printed onto a 4 mm thick PDMS substrate, which has low crosslinking density and a resultant Young's modulus below 100 kPa. by adjusting the concentration of particles in the printing solvent, the thickness of the printed wire can be kept below 100 nm. A coating of the compliant PDMS of a thickness of < 2 μιη is the added on top of the substrate, through spin-coating or spray-coating, diluting non-cured PDMS into hexane, octane, decane, or similar. Finally, micropatterned guiding fibronectin lines are transferred to the substrate using micro-contact printing or inkjet printing. In order not to constrain the tissue contraction, the substrate should be free to move, and thus not clamped in at the edges near the tissue. Consequently highly compliant liquid wells should be applied to contain the cell medium, or the applied wells should have a radius large enough to not significantly constrain the deformation of the support and wires below the localized muscle tissue. In an alternative case, conducting liquids can be applied. These can be embedded into a compliant substrate (e.g. through capillary filling of micro-fluidic channels or through direct-ink writing into a compliant substrate such as non-cured PDMS which is cured subsequently to printing).
