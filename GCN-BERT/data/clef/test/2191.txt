TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a flame retardant composition for a synthetic resin and a flame-retardant synthetic resin composition comprising the flame retardant composition. More particularly, the present invention relates to a flame retardant composition which shows a flame retarding effect in a small amount, and a flame-retardant synthetic resin composition comprising the flame retardant composition. BACKGROUND ART Conventionally, synthetic resins, because of their excellent chemical and mechanical properties, have been widely used in building materials, automobile components, packaging materials, agricultural materials, housing materials of home electrical appliances, toys and the like. However, since many of the synthetic resins are flammable substances, it is indispensable that they be made flame retardant depending on the use. As a method of making a synthetic resin flame retardant, it is widely known to use one or a combination of halogen-based flame retardants, inorganic phosphorus-based flame retardants represented by red phosphorus and polyphosphate flame retardants such as ammonium polyphosphate, organic phosphorus-based flame retardants represented by triaryl phosphate compounds, metal hydroxides and flame retardant aids such as antimony oxide and melamine compounds. However, halogen-based flame retardants have a problem in that they generate a toxic gas during combustion. Therefore, attempts have been made to use a phosphorus-based flame retardant that does not cause such a problem. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a flame-retardant synthetic resin composition comprising ammonium polyphosphate, a polyhydric hydroxyl group-containing compound, a triazine ring-containing compound and a metal hydroxide. In addition, Patent Documents 2 and 3 disclose flame-retardant synthetic resin compositions comprising melamine polyphosphate and (penta to tripenta)erythritol. Moreover, Patent Document 4 discloses a flame-retardant synthetic resin composition comprising polybutyrene terephthalate (PBT), melamine pyrophosphate and an aromatic phosphate oligomer. Furthermore, Patent Documents 5 and 6 describe that melamine pyrophosphate and other phosphorus compounds are effective for flame retardation of polymers such as PBT. Thereamong, intumescent flame retardants, which exert flame retardancy by forming a surface intumescent layer when combusted and inhibiting diffusion of decomposition products and heat transfer, have excellent flame retardancy, and such intumescent flame retardants are described in, for example, Patent Document 7.

Examples of the salt of phosphoric acid and melamine which is preferably used include melamine orthophosphate, melamine pyrophosphate and melamine polyphosphate, among which melamine pyrophosphate represented by the Formula (1) wherein n is 2, p is 2 and X1 is melamine is particularly preferred. The salt of phosphoric acid and melamine can be obtained by the following method. For example, in the case of melamine pyrophosphate, it can be obtained by allowing sodium pyrophosphate to react with melamine at an arbitrary reaction ratio with an addition of hydrochloric acid and neutralizing the resultant with sodium hydroxide.

Thereamong, a piperazine polyphosphate represented by the Formula (3) wherein q is 1 and Y1 is piperazine, particularly piperazine pyrophosphate, is preferred.

The pentaerythritol condensate may be a mixture of pentaerythritol and a pentaerythritol condensate(s) (in the present invention, this is referred to as "(poly)pentaerythritol mixture"), and this (poly)pentaerythritol mixture contains pentaerythritol having a degree of condensation, which is represented by n, of 1 to 3 (n = 1 to 3) and a condensate(s) thereof in a total of 5 to 40% by mass with respect to the total amount of the (poly)pentaerythritol mixture (wherein, the sum of the content of pentaerythritol having n of 1 to 3 and a condensate(s) thereof and the content of condensate(s) of pentaerythritol having n of 4 or higher (n ≥ 4) is 100% by mass). It is noted here that pentaerythritol has n of 1 (n = 1) and dipentaerythritol has n of 2 (n = 2). From the standpoint of flame retardancy, the (poly)pentaerythritol mixture is preferably one which contains pentaerythritol having a degree of condensation, which is represented by n, of 1 to 3 (n = 1 to 3) and a condensate(s) thereof in a total of 10 to 30% by mass with respect to the total amount of the mixture, more preferably one containing 0 to 10% by mass of pentaerythritol having n of 1 (n = 1), whose total content of pentaerythritol having n of 1 to 3 (n = 1 to 3) and a condensate(s) thereof is 5 to 30% by mass, most preferably one containing 0 to 5% by mass of pentaerythritol having n of 1 (n = 1), whose total content of pentaerythritol having n of 1 to 3 (n = 1 to 3) and a condensate(s) thereof is 10 to 30% by mass.

The (poly)pentaerythritol mixture is not particularly restricted and can be produced by a known method. For example, the (poly)pentaerythritol mixture can be produced by subjecting pentaerythritol and/or a pentaerythritol condensate(s) to a dehydration condensation reaction under heating, directly or in the presence of an appropriate catalyst and solvent. Examples of the catalyst used for the production of the (poly)pentaerythritol mixture include inorganic acids and organic acids that are usually used in a dehydration condensation reaction of an alcohol. Examples of the inorganic acids include mineral acids such as phosphoric acid and sulfuric acid; acidic salts of these mineral acids; and solid acid catalysts such as clay minerals (e.g., montmorillonite), silica-alumina and zeolite. Examples of the organic acids include formic acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid. The amount of the catalyst to be used is not particularly restricted and, when an aqueous acid catalyst is used, it can be used in such an amount that can maintain the pH in the reaction system during reaction to be lower than 7, preferably 5 or lower. Further, when a solid acid catalyst is used, usually, it can be used in an amount of 0.1 to 100% by mass with respect to the amount of pentaerythritol. Examples of the solvent used for the production of the (poly)pentaerythritol mixture include hydrocarbons such as benzene, xylene, decalin and tetralin; ethers such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl ether, anisole, phenyl ether, diglyme, tetraglyme and 18-crown-6; ketones such as methyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, methyl benzoate and γ-butyrolactone; N-substituted amides such as N-methylpyrrolidin-one, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpiperidone and hexamethylphosphoric triamide; tertiary amines such as N,N-diethylaniline, N-methylmorpholine, pyridine and quinoline; sulfones such as sulfolane; sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide; urea derivatives such as 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone; phosphine oxides such as tributylphosphine oxide; and silicone oils. These solvents may be dehydrated or hydrous. The reaction temperature of the dehydration condensation under heating in the production of the (poly)pentaerythritol mixture is usually about 100 to 280°C, more preferably 150 to 240°C. When the reaction temperature is lower than 100°C, the progress of the reaction may be slow, whereas when the reaction temperature is higher than 280°C, it may be difficult to control the condensation reaction.

Among these anti-dripping agents, polytetrafluoroethylene is most preferred because of its anti-dripping property. Examples of the layered silicates include smectite-type clay minerals such as montmorillonite, saponite, hectorite, beidellite, stevensite and nontronite; vermiculite; halloysite; swellable mica; and talc, and those in which organic cations, quaternary ammonium cations or phosphonium cations are intercalated between layers can also be used.

The results thereof are also shown in Table 8. <Flame Retardancy UL-94V Test Method> Each test piece of 127 mm in length, 12.7 mm in width and 1.6 mm in thickness was held vertically and a burner flame was brought into contact with the lower end of the test piece for 10 seconds. Then, the flame was removed and the time required for the flame ignited on the test piece to be extinguished was measured. Next, simultaneously with the flame extinction, a flame was again brought into contact with the test piece for 10 seconds, and the time required for the flame ignited on the test piece to be extinguished was measured in the same manner as in the first measurement. In addition, at the same time, it was also evaluated whether or not a piece of cotton placed under the test piece was ignited by cinders falling from the test piece. Based on the combustion time after the first and second contacts with flame, the presence or absence of ignition of the piece of cotton and the like, the condition of the combustion was rated in accordance with the UL-94V standard. The combustion rating of V-0 represents the highest level of flame retardancy, followed by the ratings of V-1 and V-2 that represent lower levels of flame retardancy. When the condition did not correspond to any of the ratings V-0 to V-2, it was indicated as "NR". <Measurement Method of Tensile Strength> The tensile strength was measured in accordance with ISO527. <Measurement Method of Charpy Impact Strength> The Charpy impact strength was measured in accordance with ISO179-1 (with notch).
