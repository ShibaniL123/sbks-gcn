In some embodiments, tool supports 260a, 260b are on opposite sides of the distal end of probe 10. In some embodiments, tool support 260a is attached to the same side of the distal end of probe 10 as operator location L1 is positioned (e.g. the left side of the page as shown), and tool support 260b is attached to the same side of the distal end of probe 10 as operator location L2 is positioned, e.g. the right side of the page as shown. Alternatively, tool support 260a is attached to the opposite side of the distal end of probe 10 as operator location L1 is positioned (e.g. the right side of the page), and tool support 260b is attached to the opposite side of the distal end of probe 10 as operator location L2 is positioned, e.g. the left side of the page. One operator can control a first tool at one side of the introduction device 250 at which extends from a distal end of the articulating probe 10. Another operator can control a second tool positioned at another side of the distal end of the articulating probe 10. In another embodiment, both operators can have tools positioned at both sides of the introduction device 250 and the distal end of the articulating probe 10. The tool positioning system 100 can include a base 285. The base 285 can comprise openings for receiving the tool supports 260 and the introducer 250, which can be attached to the base 285 at their midportions, or at distal ends thereof. The first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b are coupled to the base 285 to maintain a relative position between the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b and/or maintain a fixed orientation between the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b. The base 285 can comprise a collar or the like that surrounds at least a portion of the introduction device 250. The collar can extend in a lateral direction relative to a direction of extension of the introduction device 250. As shown in FIG. 4, the base 285 can have an opening 287 aligned with a guide element 261 of each tool support 260. The guide element 261 can be affixed to the opening 287 of the base 285. The tool positioning system 100 can include a connector 280, also referred to as a dogbone connector, coupled to the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b. The connector 280 is constructed and arranged to maintain a relative position between the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b. In some embodiments, connector 280 is constructed and arranged to maintain a relative orientation between the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b. The connector 280 can comprise a rigid structure. The connector 280 can comprise at least a portion that is flexible. The connector 280 can comprise an operator shapeable structure. The connector 280 can comprise a malleable structure. The connector 280 can comprise two segments connected by a hinge, such as a butt hinge, a butterfly hinge, a barrel hinge or a hinge comprising a flexible portion positioned between two rigid portions. The connector 280 can comprise a telescopically adjustable structure, such as to allow separation of tool supports 260a and 260b. The connector 280 can comprise two segments connected by a rotatable connector, such as a universal joint. The connector 280 can be constructed and arranged to be shaped, molded, or the like, such as after the application of heat. The connector 280 can be constructed and arranged to be attachable to at least one of the first tool support 260a or the second tool support 260b. The connector 280 can be constructed and arranged to be detachable to at least one of the first tool support 260a or the second tool support 260b. An alternative connector can be provided, for example, connector 280″ shown in FIG. 5, that is attachable to the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b. The alternative connector 280″ can be constructed and arranged to maintain a relative position between the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b. The original connector 280 can be constructed and arranged to position the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b in a first geometry, and the alternative connector 280″ can be constructed and arranged to position the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b in a second geometry different than the first geometry. The original connector 280 can differ from the alternative connector 280″ by at least one of length, shape or curvature. The connector 280 comprises a first opening and a second opening, each constructed and arranged to operably engage a guide element of the first and second tool supports 260a, 260b. The first opening and the second opening can be constructed and arranged to position the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b in a non-parallel configuration. At least one of the first opening or the second opening can comprise a funnel-shaped opening, for example, for receiving a guide element 261, more specifically, a funnel-shaped proximal end 264 of an outer guide element 262 as shown in FIG. 3. The tool positioning system 100 can include at least one fixation point, 133a-e shown (generally, 133), each constructed and arranged to attach to a stabilizing brace. A fixation point 133a can be positioned at the introduction device 250. A fixation point 133b can be positioned at the base 285. A fixation point 133c can be positioned at the first tool support 260a. A fixation point 133d can be positioned at the second tool support 260b. A fixation point 133e can be positioned at the connector 280. A brace 132, also referred to as a support, can be attached to the fixation point 133a. Another end of the brace 132 can be attached to other locations related to the tool positioning system 100, such as an operating room floor, the patient operating table (T) and/or an articulating probe feeder 110. The brace 132 can include a clamping device and the like for clamping to a floor table or other supporting object. Multiple braces can be coupled to different fixation points 133. For example, a brace (not shown) can be coupled between the fixation point 133b at the base 285 and a fixation point 133c at the first tool support 260a. Another brace 131 can be attached to the feeder 110 and can be clamped or otherwise attached to a floor, table or other object providing stability. The system 100 can include a first human interface device (HID) 80a and a second HID 80b that communicate with a controller 85. As shown in FIG. 1, the first HID 80a can be proximate to or oriented toward the first operator location (L1) and the second HID 80b can be proximate to or oriented toward the second operator location (L2). In other embodiments, the first and second HIDs 80a, 80b can be part of a same hardware platform, and can be at a single or multiple operator location, for example, location (L1), and can permit an operator at either location L1 or L2 to access the HIDs 80a, 80b at the same location. Some or all of the first HID 80a and/or the second HID 80b can be integrated into a tool inserted at a tool support 260. In an embodiment, the system 100 includes a third HID 80c attached to integral with dogbone connector 280, HID 80c in wired or wireless communication with the controller 85. One or more HIDs 80a, b, c (generally, 80) can be constructed and arranged to manipulate the articulating probe 10, the tool supports 260, one or more tools inserted into tool supports 260, or a combination thereof. In system 100 of FIG. 1, the first HID 80a is oriented toward the first operator location (L1). The second HID 80b is oriented toward the second operator location (L2). A first operator, such as a medical professional, may control the articulating probe 10 via the HID 80a to steer, advance, retract or otherwise control the functions and movement of articulating probe 10 via commands sent to the controller 85. A light source, camera, or other device attached to the articulating probe may be activated in response to a control signal generated by the HID 80a. Alternatively or additionally, a second operator may control the articulating probe 10 via the second HID 80b, to steer, advance, retract or otherwise control the functions and movement of the articulating probe 10 via commands sent to the controller 85. A light source, camera, or other device attached to the articulating probe may be activated in response to a control signal generated by the HID 80b. The first HID 80a and/or the second HID 80b may include a device selected from the group consisting of: a haptic controller, a joystick, a track ball, a mouse and an electromechanical device. The articulating probe 10 may be controlled via an HID 80, and the surgical tools may be controlled via a tool handle, for example, a tool handle as shown in FIG. 6. One or more HIDs 80 can communicate with the controller by a physical connector, such as a conductive wire, or by a wireless connection, for example, a Bluetooth™ connection. An HID 80 can include switches, joystick, buttons, and the like for applying forces related to the movement of an articulating probe 10 shown in FIG. 4. In other embodiments, an HID 80 can include force sensors such as strain gauges, which can detect forces applied to a dogbone connector 280, for example, push, pull, and/or twist forces. Such forces can be applied for controlling the articulating probe 10 shown in FIG. 4, for example, to advance, retract, or steer the probe 10. During a medical procedure, the patient (P) can lie on an operation table (T), for example, face up as shown in FIG. 1. In an embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1, the first operator location (L1) and second operator location (L2) can be side-by-side, or neighboring each other in a manner that permits two or more operators to each maneuver one or more tools. The first tool support 260a and/or the second tool support 260b can be constructed and arranged to provide tool access to a patient's head (H). For example, the first tool support 260a can provide tool access to a patient's esophagus via the patient's mouth. The first tool support 260a and/or the second tool support 260b can be constructed and arranged to provide tool access to at least one of a patient chest or a patient abdomen FIG. 2 is a top view of a tool positioning system 100 for performing a medical procedure, in accordance with other embodiments of the present inventive concepts. Many of the elements described with respect to FIG. 1 are the same as or similar to those of FIG. 2, and will therefore not be described again for brevity. In the embodiment of FIG. 2, the first operator location (L1) and the second operator location (L2) are at face-to-face locations, for example, at opposite sides of an operating table (T) so that an operator at the first operator location (L1) and an operator at the second operator location (L2) can face each other. The first tool support 260a can extend in a direction towards the first operator location (L1) at a first side of the table (T) and the second tool support 260b can extend in a direction towards the second operator location (L2) at a second side of the table (T) opposite the first side. The first tool support 260a and/or the second tool support 260b can be constructed and arranged to provide tool access to a region of the patient's (P) body, for example, at least one of a patient chest or a patient abdomen. As shown in FIG. 3, the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b can be fixedly coupled to a surface of the introduction device 250 instead of a base. In an embodiment, the first tool support 260a and/or the second tool support 260b are directly coupled to the introduction device 250 by attachment mechanisms, for example, welding points 286a, 286b, respectively. Alternatively, other bonding techniques, for example, adhesives and the like, can be applied. The connection at the introduction device 250 maintains a fixed distance and/or a fixed orientation between the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b. In some embodiments, the tool supports 260a and 260b can be rotatably attached to each other and/or a base for maintaining a fixed distance but not a fixed orientation. The first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b can be fixed in position relative to each other. Accordingly, positions of the first and second tool supports 260a, 260b are maintained during an operation of the tool positioning system 100. At least one of the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b can include first and second guide elements 261a, 261b, respectively. The first guide element 261a can include an outer guide element 262a, also referred to as a proximal guide element, and an inner guide element 263a, also referred to as a distal guide element. The second guide element 261b can include an outer guide element 262b and an inner guide element 263b. At least a portion of the inner guide element 263a, b (generally, 263) is flexible. The inner guide element 263 can be formed of plastic or related material. Materials can include but are not limited to fluoropolymers (e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene), fluorinated ethylene propylene, polyether block amide, high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene and/or nickel titanium alloy. Inner guide element 263 can comprise laser cut tubes (e.g. polymer or metal tubes) and/or coils or braids of plastic or metal. In some embodiments, inner guide element 263 comprises a polytetrafluoroethylene liner. In some embodiments, inner guide element 263 comprises a stainless steel coil. In some embodiments, inner guide element 263 comprises a coil covered by a polyether block amide. In some embodiments, inner guide element 263 comprises different varying stiffness along its length, such as when comprising a tube of varying durometers along its length. At least a portion of the outer guide element 262a, 262b (generally, 262) is rigid, with limited or no flexibility. As shown in FIG. 3, the outer guide elements 262a, 262b can be directly anchored to the introduction device 250 by a weld 286a, 286b, respectively. The outer guide elements 262 can include a first tube. The inner guide elements 263 can include a second tube, a portion of which can be positioned in, and move relative to, the first tube of the outer guide element 262. In this manner, the inner guide element 263 can movably extend from the outer guide element 262, for example, in a telescoping configuration. As shown in FIG. 4, a tool support 260 can rotatably engage the base 285. A single tool support 260 is shown in FIG. 4, however any tool support described herein (e.g. first tool support 260a, second tool support 260b, third tool support 260c, and/or fourth tool support 260d) can be configured as shown. The tool support 260 can be coupled to the base 285 by a gimbal 630, permitting the tool support 260 to rotate relative to the base 285, for example, allowing for three degrees of freedom between tool support 260 and base 285, which can include two-dimensional (X-Y) movement plus rotation. The gimbal 630 or other pivoted or ball and joint mechanism permits the guide element 261 of the tool support 260 to rotatably or fixedly engage the base 285, for example, at a mid-portion of the guide element 261. In embodiments where a tool support 260 is slidably adjustable, thus allowing for a shortening of a portion of the support 260 that attaches to the dogbone connector 280, the dogbone connector 280 may require adjustability of the distance between connector openings. Depending on the desired relative orientation of one support 260 to the other, parallel or angled, then the adjustability in the connector 280 for the distance between openings can occur along a straight or curved path. Alternatively, the guide element 261 of the tool support 260 can be fixedly attached to a base, for example, at a mid-portion of the guide element 261. The tool support 260 can be locked in a fixed position relative to the base 285. The system 100 can include a locking mechanism 635 to lock the at least one tool support 260 in the fixed position. The locking mechanism may be constructed to secure a position of the tool supports 260 with respect to the base 285, thus preventing the tool supports 260 from sliding or otherwise moving axially during movement of the tools by one or more operators. The outer guide element 262 of the guide element 261 of a tool support 260 can be constructed and arranged to have a hollow elongate member. The hollow elongate member can be constructed and arranged as a structure known to those of ordinary skill in the art, for example, a hollow tube; a coil such as a helical coil, or combinations thereof. In an embodiment, the entire hollow elongate member is rigid. In another embodiment, at least a portion of the hollow elongate member can be rigid. The inner guide element 263 can be likewise constructed and arranged to have a hollow elongate member. In an embodiment, the entire hollow elongate member can include a flexible tube. Alternatively, the hollow elongate member can include at least a flexible portion. The inner guide element 263 can slide along an inner surface in the opening of the outer guide element 262 in which the inner guide element 263 is positioned. The outer guide element 262 can have a funnel-shaped proximal end 264. The inner guide element 263 can likewise have a funnel shaped proximal end 265. Either or both funnels 264, 265 can be configured to readily and atraumatically introduce tools to the tool support 260. As shown in FIG. 3, a funnel shaped proximal end 264a, b of each tool support 260a, b, respectively, can be positioned about an opening in a connector 280. The outer guide element 262 and/or inner guide element 263 can be constructed and arranged to guide or otherwise provide a support for a tool shaft so that it can be guided to a side port 637 coupled to an outer surface of the articulating probe 10. The side port 637 can be coupled to a distal link 631 of the articulating probe 10. The side port 637 can be formed at a flange at the articulating probe 10. Multiple side ports may be positioned along the outer sleeve of the articulating probe 10 so as to provide a guide for one or more guide elements 261 that articulate in common with the articulating probe 10. Alternatively, the inner guide element 263 can be fixedly attached to the outer surface of the articulating probe 10, for example, the distal link 631, such as with an adhesive or mechanical fastener. FIG. 5 is a perspective view of a tool positioning system 100 having multiple connectors 280, 280′, in accordance with an embodiment. The tool positioning system 100 can also comprise a first tool support 260a, a second tool support 260b, a third tool support 260c and a fourth tool support 260d. Each of tool supports 260a-d can include a funnel-shaped opening, 264a-d respectively, on its proximal end. The tool supports 260a-d and the introduction device 250 are fixedly attached to base 285. The third tool support 260c can comprise at least one guide element 261c, which can be similar to the guide elements 261a and 261b described herein. For example, the guide element 261c can include an outer guide element 262c and an inner guide element 263c. The fourth tool support 260d can comprise at least one guide element 261d, which can be similar to the guide elements 261a and 261b described herein. For example, the guide element 261d can include an outer guide element 262d and an inner guide element 263d. The first tool support 260a and the third tool support 260c can be oriented in a same or similar direction, for example, toward a first operator location. The second tool support 260b and the fourth tool support 260d can be oriented in a same or similar direction, for example, toward a second operator location. Tools (not shown) extending from the first and third tool supports 260a, c, respectively, are shown positioned at a first side and a second side of a distal end of the articulating probe 10, and tools (not shown) extending from the second and fourth tool supports 260b, d, respectively, are shown positioned at the first side and the second side of the distal end of the articulating probe 10, where the first side is opposite the second side. In an alternative embodiment, not shown, tools extending from the first and third tool supports 260a, c, respectively, can be positioned at a first side of a distal end of the articulating probe 10, and tools extending from the second and fourth tool supports 260b, d, respectively, can be positioned at a second side of the distal end of the articulating probe 10. The outer guide element 262a of the first tool support 260a and the outer guide element 262c of the third tool support 260c can be oriented in a same or similar direction, for example, toward a first operator location. The outer guide element 262b of the second tool support 260b and the outer guide element 262d of the fourth tool support 260d can be oriented in a same or similar direction, for example, toward a first operator location. However, the first and second inner guide elements 263a, b can be collocated, and the third and fourth inner guide elements 263c, d can be collocated. The tool positioning system 100 can comprise a connector 280 attached to proximal ends of the first tool support 260a and the third tool support 260c. The connector 280 is constructed and arranged to maintain a relative position between the first tool support 260a and the third tool support 260c. The tool positioning system 100 can also comprise a second connector 280′ attached to proximal ends of the second tool support 260b and the fourth tool support 260d. The connector 280′ is constructed and arranged to maintain a relative position between the second tool support 260b and fourth tool support 260d. In another embodiment, the first connector 280 can be attached to proximal ends of the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260b, and the second connector 280′ can be attached proximal ends of the third tool support 260c and the fourth tool support 260d. The connector 280, also referred to as a first connector or first dogbone connector, and/or the connector 280′, also referred to as a second connector or second dogbone connector, can be removed from the tool supports 260 and replaced with a different connector 280″, which can have different configuration parameters than the connectors 280, 280′, for example, a different length or openings for receiving a funnel shaped guide element 261. FIG. 6 is a perspective view of a tool positioning system 100 having three tools 201, 202, 203 in communication with a connector 280, in accordance with an embodiment. A single operator can operate tool positioning system 100, including any or all three tools 201, 202, 203. Alternatively, two or more operators can operate tool positioning system 100 of FIG. 6, including any or all three tools 201, 202, 203. Three tool supports 260a, 260c, 260e extend between a base 285 and a connector 280. Each of tool supports 260a, 260c and 260e can include a funnel-shaped opening, 264a, 264c and 264e respectively, on their proximal end. The base 285 includes a collar having first, second, and third openings aligned with the first, second, and third tool supports 260a, 260c, 260e, respectively. The guide elements 261a, 261c, 261e (generally, 261) of the first, second, third and tool supports 260a, 260c, 260e, respectively, can extend through the first, second, and third openings so that mid-portions of the guide elements 261 are positioned in the openings during operation. The base 285 can include a fourth opening for receiving an introduction device 250. At least one tool 201, 202, 203 can have a shaft, shown inserted into tool supports 260a, 260c and 260e, respectively, constructed and arranged to be slidingly received by a corresponding tool support 260. One or more tools 201, 202, 203 can be selected from the group consisting of: suction device; ventilator; light; camera; grasper; laser; cautery; clip applier; scissors; needle; needle driver; scalpel; RF energy delivery device; cryogenic energy delivery device; and combinations thereof. A tool 201, 202, 203 can include a rigid and/or a flexible tool shaft. The connector 280 is attached to first, second, and third tool supports 260a, 260c, 260e and can be constructed and arranged to maintain a relative distance between the tool supports 260a, 260c, 260e. The connector 280 can be fixedly attached to one or more of the tool supports 260. Alternatively, the connector 280 can be rotatably attached to one or more of the tool supports 260. The connector 280 maintains a relative position of the third tool support 260e relative to the first tool support 260a and the second tool support 260c. The base 285 can be fixedly attached to one or more of the tool supports 260. Alternatively, the base 285 can be rotatably attached to one or more of the tool supports 260. A gimbal (see FIG. 4) can be at the base 285 which rotatably engages one or more guide elements 261 at the base 285. A single operator can operate one or more of: the tool 201 extending from the first tool support 260a, the tool 202 extending from the second tool support 260c, and/or the tool 203 extending from the third tool support 260e, for example, from a single operator location. Alternatively, one operator can operate two tools of the tools 201, 202, 203, and another operator can operate the remaining tool of the tools 201, 202, 203. As shown in FIG. 7, a first tool 201 is positioned at a first side of a distal end of the articulating probe 10, i.e., the left side of the page as shown, and a second tool 202 is positioned at a second side of the distal end of the articulating probe 10, i.e., the right side of the page as shown, opposite the first side. A third tool 203 can optionally be positioned between the first and second tools 201, 202 at the distal end of the probe 10. First tool 201 has been inserted through a first tool support including inner guide element 263a. Inner guide element 263a passes through base 285, such as via a gimbal not shown but positioned behind probe 10. Second tool 202 has been inserted through a second tool support including inner guide element 263c. Inner guide element 263c passes through base 285 via gimbal 630c. Third tool 203 has been inserted through a third tool support including inner guide element 263e. Inner guide element 263e passes through base 285 via gimbal 630e. The first tool 201 can be controlled by an operator at the corresponding side of the articulating probe 10, i.e., the first side or left side of the page as shown. Alternatively, the first tool 201 can be controlled by an operator on the opposite side of the articulating probe 10, i.e., the second side or right side of the page as shown. The second tool 202 can be controlled by an operator at the corresponding side of the articulating probe 10, i.e., the second side or right side of the page as shown. Alternatively, the second tool 202 can be controlled by an operator on the opposite side of the articulating probe 10, i.e., the first side or left side of the page as shown. The operator at the first and second sides can be the same operator, or different operators at different locations, for example, side-by-side as shown in FIG. 1 or face-to-face as shown in FIG. 2. As described above, the articulating probe 10 comprises a distal link 631, which can be positioned about an articulating probe 10. As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8A-D, the distal link 631 comprises at least three side ports 637. In FIG. 8B, the distal link 631″ can include three side ports 637 that can be coupled to three tool supports, for example, tool supports 260a, c, e, respectively, shown in FIG. 6 and FIG. 7. In another embodiment, as shown in FIG. 8C, a distal link 631′″ comprises four side ports 637, which can be coupled to four tool supports, for example, tool supports 260a-d, respectively, shown in FIG. 5. In another embodiment, as shown in FIG. 8A, a distal link 631′ comprises five side ports 637, which can be coupled to five tool supports, for example, two tool supports oriented toward one operator location, and three tool supports oriented toward another operator location. In an embodiment, as shown in FIG. 8B, the sideports 637 are symmetrically spaced about a periphery of the distal link 631″. In an embodiment, as shown in FIG. 8D, the sideports 637 are asymmetrically spaced about a periphery of the distal link 631′. The side ports 637 can be positioned 30° to 180° apart from each other about a periphery of the connector 280. For example, as shown in FIG. 8D, first and second side ports 637 can be less than 180° apart from each other, such as 150° apart, and a third side port 637 can be positioned between the first and second side ports, such that the third side port 637 is less than 90° apart from each of the first and second side ports 637.
