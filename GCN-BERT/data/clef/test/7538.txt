FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a process for diminishing the adsorption capacity of coal ash, persistently surrounding particles of the coal ash with latex polymer, diminishing the adsorption capacity of the quantity of coal ash and thereby making the coal ash a more suitable constituent of any of a variety of cementitious materials. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The problems associated with the use of high carbon content coal ash as a constituent material for contemporary cementitious products are well known. Scores of articles have been published regarding coal ash adsorption of air-entraining admixtures leading to inconsistent air content amongst cement pours and ultimately resulting in premature concrete failure. Researchers have identified three distinctly different carbon types in coal ash samples taken from different ashes all considered to be “high carbon content coal ash”. These microscopically identifiable carbon types are inertinite, isotropic coke and anisotropic coke. The three carbon types have distinctly different chemical and physical properties leading to different adsorption capacities for air entraining admixtures when used in cementitious systems. Variability in adsorption potential for high carbon coal ash often results in significant variability in concrete performance with regard to both slump characteristics and freeze-thaw durability. Such variation in pertinent concrete performance properties has resulted in high carbon content coal ash being excluded for use in many cementitious applications. An noteworthy exclusion criterion is that promulgated by a state agency regulating materials used in the construction of various highways, in which case, for example, the loss of ignition (LOI) for fly ash to be used in concrete is not to exceed three percent. It is important to note the carbon materials inertinite, isotropic coke and anisotropic coke are not the only carbon components comprising coal ash with potentially detrimental consequences for use in contemporary cementitious applications. Various fly ash waste streams are also known to contain small percentages of activated carbon. Activated carbon is often injected into flue gas streams to prevent nuisance elements from being discharged to the atmosphere—with an example of a nuisance element being mercury. In past regulatory environments, markets existed for fly ashes containing high contents of carbon—for example, coal ashes with LOI greater than three percent. During such times, one routine outlet for high carbon content fly ash was its use as feedstock to cement kilns. Various fly ashes are often high in silica- and alumina-containing compounds, making these materials valuable contributors to cement production from a technologic point of view. Although fly ash serves as a suitable raw material for cement production, new industrial emissions standards may endanger such a promising outlet for fly ash. The underlying reason is that fly ashes also contain nuisance materials such as arsenic, mercury, lead, cadmium and zinc, to name a few. When introduced to the high operating temperatures of a cement kiln, these materials have a tendency to transition into their respective vapor phases, thus becoming gaseous emissions. New emissions standards may force cement producers to seek raw materials that will not be significant contributors to unwanted gaseous pollutants. Fly ashes once destined for use in cement kilns will now likely end up in landfills. It is becoming apparent that the amended Clean Air Act in the United States and similar regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions create quite the conundrum for both the coal-fired utilities industry and the cement industry. New regulations are cleaning up the air, but these regulations are continuing to pressure industry with regard to finding outlets for waste streams. The invention herein described is useful for diminishing negative effects associated with problematic coal ash when used either in combination with other hydraulic binders or as a hydraulic binder. Typically, problematic coal ash falls outside specifications provided by ASTM C618, Standard Specification for Coal Fly Ash and Raw or Calcined Natural Pozzolan for Use in Concrete. The invention, according to which, inter alia, coal ash and latex polymer are mixed, provides either a partial or full coating for coal ash particles which acts as a diffusion barrier, diminishing the adsorption capacity of the coal ash, thus rendering it usable in cementitious materials. Mixing problematic coal ash with any form of latex polymer, whether liquid dispersion or dispersible polymer powder, enables use of problematic coal ash in cementitious materials, providing a viable “green” alternative when compared to traditional landfilling of such problematic coal ash. Problematic coal ash may typically result from lower process temperatures employed in coal burning processes. Such low temperatures cause coal ash morphology to differ from the morphology characteristic of coal ash produced during past regulatory regimes. Problematic coal ash resulting from lower process temperatures is likely to be more “platy” in shape, whereas coal ash which has been burned at high temperatures may appear completely fused and round. Platy particle morphology often results in increased water demand for cementitious materials, as the platy particles do not flow as well as round particles. Increased water demand often creates a number of troubles for cementitious materials, with two notable problems being increased pore diameter and increased rates of harmful ion ingress. There is accordingly a long-felt need for a process for diminishing the adsorption capacity of coal ash. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides, inter alia, a process for diminishing the adsorption capacity of coal ash, persistently surrounding particles of the coal ash with latex polymer, diminishing the adsorption capacity of the quantity of coal ash and thereby making the coal ash a more suitable constituent of any of a variety of cementitious materials. A process according to the invention comprises, inter alia, mixing coal ash with one or more latex polymers to form a mixture, reducing water demand and increasing the “flow” of cementitious materials formed from the mixture. Thus, a process according to the invention is useful to ensure the suitability for use in the making of cementitious materials of coal ash from any one or more of an extraordinarily wide variety of coal burning process, including coal ash from a fluidized bed combustion (FBC) process, coal ash containing large amounts of activated carbon, or, more generally, virtually any high carbon content coal ash. In a process according to the invention, a latex polymer may in the form of a liquid dispersion or a dispersible polymer powder. The invention is useful in that, inter alia, a product of a process according to the invention possesses favorable material flow properties even in those instances in which a process input comprises problematic coal ash having “platy” morphology. According to the invention, a partial or full coating for coal ash particles is developed through a mixing process. A mixing process according to the invention can be in the form of a liquid mixing process or a dry powder mixing process. A liquid or wet mixing process according to the invention may comprise mixing dry coal ash with liquid latex polymer dispersion, coal ash slurry with liquid latex polymer dispersion, dry coal ash with dispersible latex polymer powder along with a suitable liquid medium, coal ash slurry with dispersible latex polymer powder, or, more generally, contacting a plurality of coal ash particles with latex polymer while in a suitable liquid medium. A dry mixing process according to the invention may comprise mixing dry, problematic coal ash and dispersible polymer powder. According to the invention, the mass ratio of coal ash to dispersible polymer powder in such a dry mixing process may be greater than unity. According to the invention, a coal ash particle may have any of a variety of different polarities, depending upon carbon type present. According to the invention, a dispersible polymer powder may have any of a variety of different polarities, depending upon type and constituent percentage of monomer from which the dispersible polymer powder is formed. When a suitable combination of dry coal ash and dry polymer is mixed, a coal ash particle of a first polarity may be attracted to a polymer particle of a second and opposite polarity. A resultant association of a coal ash particle of a first polarity with a polymer particle of a second and opposite polarity may possess fewer active sites available for adsorption of other component materials within a formulation. A latex polymer according to the invention may comprise an elastomeric latex, a thermoplastic latex or a thermosetting latex or any combination thereof.

A dispersible powder polymer according to the invention may comprise a copolymer of styrene and butadiene. An example of a dispersible polymer powder is Axilat PSB150. In a process according to the invention, coal ash and latex polymer may be mixed with, inter alia, a composition comprising a hydraulic binder. According to the invention, the term “hydraulic binder” refers to a pulverized material in the solid, dry state, which when mixed with water yields mixtures which are able to set and harden, with a common example being the term “cement”.

EXAMPLES Aspects of the present invention are more fully illustrated by the following examples, set forth to illustrate certain aspects of the present invention and not to be construed as limiting thereof. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the applicant has recognized that a vinyl acetate/ethylene based (latex) polymeric material appears to encapsulate each of a plurality of coal ash particles as a result of a process according to the invention in which coal ash is mixed with such a latex polymer. Activated carbon particles are used in power plants to adsorb mercury and perhaps adsorb other toxins before such toxins are released to the atmosphere. Activated carbon particles injected into power plant processes for such atmospheric purposes then become part of the coal ash waste stream and sometimes are present in coal ash waste streams at significant percentages. Aside from other forms of carbon comprising the coal ash, often times the presence of activated carbon in the coal ash waste stream renders the coal ash “problematic”. Activated carbon will subsequently adsorb other important constituent materials in marketable materials, preferably cementitious materials, containing such problematic coal ash. A polymer film developed by a process according to the invention creates a diffusion barrier for an activated carbon particle encapsulated within the film, thus reducing the overall capacity of the activated carbon particle for adsorption. That is, the polymer coating will influence the rate at which materials are able to be adsorbed by the activated carbon particle. Through study of electron micrographic images of products made by a process according to the invention, and other analytical techniques, the applicant has determined that adsorptive surface area of each of a plurality of carbon particles is diminished by a process according to the invention: a plurality of rough carbon particles each with a large amount of adsorptive surface area are coated by polymer to yield a product comprising a plurality of smoother polymer-coated particles.

Further example 54. Diminution of the adsorption capacity of a quantity of coal ash by a process according to the invention is demonstrated by, inter alia, a methylene blue adsorption method according to Slomka, B., Dawson, R., Buttermore, W. (Iowa State University, Ames Laboratory, Ames, Iowa 5001), Characterization of Mineral and Coal Surfaces by Adsorption of Dyes, Prepr. Pap., Am. Chem. Soc., Div. Fuel Chem., Vol. 33:4; pages 797-803; presented at the Conference: Surface chemistry of coal, Los Angeles, Calif., USA, 25-30 Sep. 1988: A continuous flow apparatus was developed for dynamic measurements of adsorption from liquid phases on solids. In a typical experiment, a pre-weighed sample of coal is placed in a sample cell and fixed between two 0.5 micron stainless steel fits. The sample is then connected to a six port switch valve and evacuated to remove air. The valve is set initially to direct the solution of dye to by-pass the cell containing the sample, causing it to flow directly through the ultraviolet/visible detector (Varian W-50). As soon as a baseline is established for the dye solution, the flowing solution is directed through the sample of coal to the UV/Vis detector. The absorbance measured for the effluent leaving the sample cell is due only to dye not adsorbed by the coal sample. The apparent absorbance is recorded at a fixed wavelength as a function of time using an AID converter at a sampling rate of 2 per second. This dynamic method of adsorption measurement allows for continuous replacement of the fluid phase in contact with the coal sample, which is not possible in a closed, static system. The rates of adsorption can be continuously measured as a function of time, giving characteristic profiles of adsorption rate, while the total adsorbate uptakes are obtained by integration of the rate profiles over the time of adsorption. The detector response to dye concentration [is] linear for the concentrations and wave lenghts used in the experiments. The detector [is] operated in the visible range at 610 nm. Based on preliminary results, two flow rates of solutions were selected, 1 and 0.5 ml/minute, according to the sample size of the materials tested. To evaluate the adsorptive components of coal and mineral surfaces, coal samples of uniform particle size and increasing mineral content [are] analyzed. Total mineral content [is] determined by standard ash analysis. Samples with very low ash content [are] used to approximate a non-mineral coal surface. To evaluate specific mineral adsorptive characteristics, mineral samples of uniform particle size and composition [are] analyzed. Ground coal samples of different mean particle size [are] analyzed to determine the effect of particle surface area. Further example 55. Diminution of the adsorption capacity of a quantity of coal ash by a process according to the invention is demonstrated by a so-called “foam index” method known in the art. Further example 56. Diminution of the adsorption capacity of a quantity of coal ash by a process according to the invention is demonstrated by a nitrogen adsorption method known in the art, such as, for example, a method described in Killaots, I., Hurt, R. H., and Suuberg, E. M., Size distribution of unburned carbon in coal fly ash and its implications, Fuel 83 (2004) 223-230. Further example 57.
