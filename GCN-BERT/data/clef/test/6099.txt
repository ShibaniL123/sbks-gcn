Step 2. 4-((3-Bromo-4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl)butan-2-ol
Sodium borohydride (2.78 mg, 0.073 mmol) was added to a solution of 4-((3-bromo-4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl)butan-2-one (16 mg, 0.052 mmol) in 1:1 MeOH/THF (1.4 mL) at 0° C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1.5 h at 0° C. The reaction was quenched with water (0.3 mL). The reaction mixture was warmed to rt, and sat. NaHCO3 was added. The aqueous mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3×). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography (10-40% EtOAc in DCM) afforded the title compound as a white residue (15 mg, 93%). LCMS for C11H16BrO3S (M+H)+: calculated m/z=307.0, 309.0; found 307.0, 309.0.
