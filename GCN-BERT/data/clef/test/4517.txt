SUBSTITUTED INDOLE MCL-1 INHIBITORS CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims benefit of and priority to United States Provisional Application Serial Number 61/971,023, filed March 27, 2014, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention pertains to compounds that inhibit the activity of an anti- apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Myeloid cell leukemia- 1 (Mcl-1) protein, compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treating cancer involving over-expressed or dysregulated Mcl-1 protein. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Abnormal regulation of apoptosis is now recognized to play an important role in the development of cancer. The apoptosis pathway can be initiated by various extracellular and intracellular stresses, including growth factor deprivation, DNA damage, oncogene induction, and cytotoxic drugs (Danial, N. N. and Korsmeyer, SJ. Cell (2004) 1 16, 205-219). The death signal leads to the oligomerization of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak. Upon activation, they permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane and release apoptogenic factors into the cytoplasm. This process is tightly regulated by both pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak, Bad, Bid, Bim, Bmf, NOXA, PUMA) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Bcl2-Al, Mcl-1) members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Recent data suggests that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins function to protect the cell from apoptotic insults, primarily by preventing disruption of mitochondrial outer membrane integrity by binding to the pro-apoptotic proteins as described in Adams, J. M. and Cory S. Oncogene (2007) 26, 1324-1337; Willis, S. N. et al. Science (2007) 315,856-859. Because tumor cells are under stress, alterations in their apoptotic signaling pathways are believed to be crucial for survival. Recent data implicates down-regulated apoptosis in the onset of cancer. Research has shown, for example, that anti- apoptotic proteins, are over-expressed in many cancer cell types as described in Beroukhim, R. et al. Nature (2010) 463, 899-905; Zhang J. Y., Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, (2002) 1, 101 ; Kirkin, V. et al. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (2004) 1644, 229-249; and Amundson, S.A. et al. Cancer Research (2000) 60, 6101-61 10. This dysregulation results in the survival of cells that would otherwise have undergone apoptosis such as cancer cells. This suggests that neutralizing the function of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins may offer an effective strategy for the elimination of cancer cells. In addition, resistance to chemotherapy which is a major cause of treatment failure and poor prognosis in many cancers can be caused by the upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. [0004] An important anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family is Myeloid cell leukemia- 1 (Mcl-1). Mcl-1 is one of the most frequently amplified anti-apoptotic genes in human cancers including prostate, lung, pancreatic, breast, ovarian, and cervical cancers, as well as melanoma, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Beroukhim et al. Nature (2010) 463, 899-905). Moreover, its overexpression is implicated as a resistance factor for multiple therapies including widely prescribed microtubule-targeted agents for breast cancers, such as paclitaxel and vincristine as well as Gemcitabine, a first-line treatment option for pancreatic cancer (Wei et al. Cancer Chemother Pharmacol (2008) 62, 1055-1064 and Wertz et al. Nature (201 1) 471 , 1 10-114). These data suggest that Mcl-1 is an important target for a wide variety of cancers. [0005] In many cancer cell types, the cancer cell's survival is attributed to the dysregulation of the apoptotic pathway caused by the over-expression of one or more anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family members. Because of the important role for Bcl-2 family of proteins in regulating apoptosis in both cancerous and non-cancerous cells, and the inter-cell variability of Bcl-2 family protein expression, it could be advantageous to have a small molecule inhibitor that selectively targets and preferably binds to one type or a subset of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein(s). A selective compound also may confer certain advantages in the clinical setting, by providing flexibility to select a dosing regimen to reduce on-target toxic effects in normal cells. [0006] Because Mcl-1 protein is an important Bcl-2 family member associated with a number of diseases, there is a need for compounds which bind to and inhibit the activity of Mcl-1 protein.

Compounds and Definitions: [0017] Compounds of this invention include those described generally above, and are further illustrated by the classes, subclasses, and species disclosed herein. As used herein, the following definitions shall apply unless otherwise indicated. For purposes of this invention, the chemical elements are identified in accordance with the Periodic Table of the Elements, CAS version, Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 75th Ed. Additionally, general principles of organic chemistry are described in "Organic Chemistry", Thomas Sorrell, University Science Books, Sausalito: 1999, and "March's Advanced Organic Chemistry", 5th Ed., Ed.: Smith, M.B. and March, J., John Wiley & Sons, New York: 2001, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. [0018] The term "aliphatic" or "aliphatic group", as used herein, means a straight-chain (i.e., unbranched) or branched, substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon chain that is completely saturated or that contains one or more units of unsaturation, or a monocyclic hydrocarbon or bicyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbon that is completely saturated or that contains one or more units of unsaturation, but which is not aromatic (also referred to herein as "carbocycle," "cycloaliphatic" or "cycloalkyl"), that has a single point of attachment to the rest of the molecule. Unless otherwise specified, aliphatic groups contain 1-6 aliphatic carbon atoms. In some embodiments, aliphatic groups contain 1-5 aliphatic carbon atoms. In other embodiments, aliphatic groups contain 1-4 aliphatic carbon atoms. In still other embodiments, aliphatic groups contain 1-3 aliphatic carbon atoms, and in yet other embodiments, aliphatic groups contain 1-2 aliphatic carbon atoms. In some embodiments, "cycloaliphatic" (or "carbocycle" or "cycloalkyl") refers to a monocyclic C3-C6 hydrocarbon that is completely saturated or that contains one or more units of unsaturation, but which is not aromatic, that has a single point of attachment to the rest of the molecule. Suitable aliphatic groups include, but are not limited to, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl groups and hybrids thereof such as (cycloalkyl)alkyl, (cycloalkenyl)alkyl or (cycloalkyl)alkenyl.

A heteroaryl group may be mono- or bicyclic. The term "heteroaryl" may be used interchangeably with the terms "heteroaryl ring," "heteroaryl group," or "heteroaromatic," any of which terms include rings that are optionally substituted. The term "heteroaralkyl" refers to an alkyl group substituted by a heteroaryl, wherein the alkyl and heteroaryl portions independently are optionally substituted. [0029] As used herein, the terms "heterocycle," "heterocyclyl," "heterocyclic radical," and "heterocyclic ring" are used interchangeably and refer to a stable 5- to 7-membered monocyclic or 7-10-membered bicyclic heterocyclic moiety that is either saturated or partially unsaturated, and having, in addition to carbon atoms, one or more, preferably one to four, heteroatoms. When used in reference to a ring atom of a heterocycle, the term "nitrogen" includes a substituted nitrogen. As an example, in a saturated or partially unsaturated ring having 1-3 heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen, the nitrogen may be N (as in 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrolyl), NH (as in pyrrolidinyl), or +NR (as in N-substituted pyrrolidinyl). [0030] A heterocyclic ring can be attached to its pendant group at any heteroatom or carbon atom that results in a stable structure and any of the ring atoms can be optionally substituted. Examples of such saturated or partially unsaturated heterocyclic radicals include, without limitation, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydrothiophenyl pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, pyrrolinyl, tetrahydroquinolinyl, tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, decahydroquinolinyl, oxazolidinyl, piperazinyl, dioxanyl, dioxolanyl, diazepinyl, oxazepinyl, thiazepinyl, morpholinyl, and quinuclidinyl.

A heterocyclyl group may be mono- or bicyclic. The term "heterocyclylalkyl" refers to an alkyl group substituted by a heterocyclyl, wherein the alkyl and heterocyclyl portions independently are optionally substituted. [0031] As used herein, the term "partially unsaturated" refers to a ring moiety that includes at least one double or triple bond. The term "partially unsaturated" is intended to encompass rings having multiple sites of unsaturation, but is not intended to include aryl or heteroaryl moieties, as herein defined. [0032] As described herein, compounds of the invention may contain "optionally substituted" moieties. In general, the term "substituted," whether preceded by the term "optionally" or not, means that one or more hydrogens of the designated moiety are replaced with a suitable substituent. Unless otherwise indicated, an "optionally substituted" group may have a suitable substituent at each substitutable position of the group, and when more than one position in any given structure may be substituted with more than one substituent selected from a specified group, the substituent may be either the same or different at every position. Combinations of substituents envisioned by this invention are preferably those that result in the formation of stable or chemically feasible compounds. The term "stable," as used herein, refers to compounds that are not substantially altered when subjected to conditions to allow for their production, detection, and, in certain embodiments, their recovery, purification, and use for one or more of the purposes disclosed herein.

[00340] In certain embodiments, compounds of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof, are administered in combination with a monoclonal antibody or an siRNA therapeutic. [00341] Those additional agents are optionally administered separately from an inventive compound-containing composition, as part of a multiple dosage regimen. Alternatively, those agents are optionally part of a single dosage form, mixed together with a compound of this invention in a single composition. If administered as part of a multiple dosage regime, the two active agents are submitted simultaneously, sequentially or within a period of time from one another normally within five hours from one another. [00342] As used herein, the term "combination," "combined," and related terms refers to the simultaneous or sequential administration of therapeutic agents in accordance with this invention. For example, a compound of the present invention is administered with another therapeutic agent simultaneously or sequentially in separate unit dosage forms or together in a single unit dosage form. Accordingly, the present invention provides a single unit dosage form comprising a provided compound, an additional therapeutic agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle. [00343] The amount of both, an inventive compound and additional therapeutic agent (in those compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent as described above)) that is combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Preferably, compositions of this invention should be formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day of an inventive can be administered. [00344] In those compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent, that additional therapeutic agent and the compound of this invention act synergistically. Therefore, the amount of additional therapeutic agent in such compositions will be less than that required in a monotherapy utilizing only that therapeutic agent. In such compositions a dosage of between 0.01 - 1,000 Î¼g/kg body weight/day of the additional therapeutic agent can be administered. [00345] The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably the amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that agent as the only therapeutically active agent. [00346] The compounds of this invention, or pharmaceutical compositions thereof, are optionally incorporated into compositions for coating an implantable medical device, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Vascular stents, for example, have been used to overcome restenosis (re-narrowing of the vessel wall after injury). However, patients using stents or other implantable devices risk clot formation or platelet activation. These unwanted effects are prevented or mitigated by pre-coating the device with a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a kinase inhibitor. Implantable devices coated with a compound of this invention are another embodiment of the present invention.

[00383] The combination therapy can be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination can be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes co-administration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities. [00384] The above other therapeutic agents, when employed in combination with the compounds of the present invention may be used, for example, in those amounts indicated in the Physicians' Desk Reference, as in the patents set out above, or can be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. [00385] The combination therapy can provide "synergy" and prove "synergistic", i.e., the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect can be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect can be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g., by different injections in separate syringes, separate pills or capsules, or in separate infusions. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together. [00386] The compounds of formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, or VII can be administered for any of the uses described herein by any suitable means, for example, orally, such as in the form of tablets, capsules, granules or powders; sublingually; bucally; parenterally, such as by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques (e.g., as sterile injectable aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions); nasally, including administration to the nasal membranes, such as by inhalation spray; topically, such as in the form of a cream or ointment; or rectally such as in the form of suppositories; in dosage unit formulations containing non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles or diluents. [00387] In carrying out the method of the invention for treating cancers and related diseases, a pharmaceutical composition will be employed containing the compounds of formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, or VII, with or without other anticancer agent(s) and/or other type therapeutic agents in association with a pharmaceutical vehicle or diluent. The pharmaceutical composition can be formulated employing conventional solid or liquid vehicles or diluents and pharmaceutical additives of a type appropriate to the mode of desired administration, such as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, binders, and the like. The compounds can be administered to a mammalian patient, including humans, monkeys, dogs, etc. by an oral route, for example, in the form of tablets, capsules, beads, granules or powders. The dose for adults is preferably between 1 and 2,000 mg per day, which can be administered in a single dose or in the form of individual doses from 1-4 times per day. [00388] A typical capsule for oral administration contains compounds of formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, or VII (250 mg), lactose (75 mg), and magnesium stearate (15 mg). The mixture is passed through a 60 mesh sieve and packed into a No. 1 gelatin capsule. [00389] A typical injectable preparation is produced by aseptically placing 250 mg of a compound of formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, or VII into a vial, aseptically freeze-drying and sealing. For use, the contents of the vial are mixed with 2 mL of physiological saline, to produce an injectable preparation.

Scheme 1 1 2 [00392] In some embodiments, provided compounds of this invention may be prepared as shown in Scheme 1. Indole 3 can be assembled by using Japp-Klingemann reaction described by, but not limited to, F. G. Salituro, et al. J. Med. Chem. (1990) 33, 2944-2946 as follows. Aniline 1 is converted to the corresponding benzenediazonium intermediate followed by condensation with ethyl 2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylate to give hydrazone 2. Intramolecular Fisher indole cyclization of the intermediate 2 is followed to give indole 3.

Applying the same reaction sequence as described in Scheme 1, compounds of Formula 16 can undergo saponification followed by coupling reaction to give compounds of Formula 18. Scheme 4 [00395] In some embodiments, compounds of Formula 21 can be synthesized by procedures depicted in Scheme 4 via selective sequential coupling reactions in one-pot. An amino group of compounds 19 can be coupled with compounds of Formula 17 as illustrated in Scheme 1 to afford intermediates 20. In the same pot, suitable carboxylic acids can be coupled to the sulfonamide group of compounds of Formula 20 using coupling reagents, but not limited to, PyBOP, DCC, EDC, HBTU, or TBTU at a number of conditions that are routine for those skilled in the art of organic synthesis, to yield acylsulfonamides of Formula 21.

Scheme 6 26 28 [00397] Exemplary method for preparing compounds of Formula 28, wherein the Nl position of indole and the amide NH is tethered to form rings, is described in Scheme 6 and proceeds from compounds of Formula 26.

Compounds of Formula 28 can be employed to subsequent reactions as depicted in above Schemes. Scheme 7 33 37 [00398] An alternate route to substituted tricyclic indole amides is shown in Scheme 7 and described here. The tricyclic amide intermediates of Formula 30 can be prepared by alkylation of the indole NH of ester 14 with optionally substituted cyclic sulfamidates 29 followed by cyclization upon removal of the Boc-protecting group (see, for example, Richter H. G. F. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2010, 5713). The size and stereochemistry of the newly formed cyclic amide can be controlled by size and preset stereo-configuration of the reagent 29. The NH group of Formula 30 can undergo alkylation reactions with compounds of Formula 31, wherein X is CI, Br, I, OMs, or OTs with a base such as NaH, K2CO3, CS2CO3, Et3N, or DIPEA in a suitable solvent such as DMF, THF, ether, DME, or the like, to give compounds of Formula 28. Corresponding compounds of Formulae 32 and 33 can be prepared from the ester 28 by saponification and coupling of sulfonamides to the carboxylic acid functional group of compounds 32 as described in Scheme 5. Alternatively, a variety of aryl or heteroaryl halides of Formula 34, wherein X is Br, I, or OTf can be coupled to the NH group of Formula 30 in the presence of a catalytic Pd species, such as Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3 and a suitable ligand such as Xantphos and a base such as Na2C03, CS2CO3, or K2C03 to generate compounds of Formula 35. Same saponification and coupling of sulfonamide coupling protocols described above can also be applied to prepare corresponding compounds of Formulae 36 and 37. Scheme 8 38 39 [00399] In some embodiments, compounds of Formula 39 containing tetrazole moiety can be generated by the procedure depicted in Scheme 8.

ASSAYS FOR BCL-2 FAMILY PROTEINS ACTIVITY [00909] The in vitro modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins was determined as follows. Bak Peptide Binding Assay General [00910] Provided compounds of the present invention can be demonstrated to compete for binding with fluorescently labeled peptides derived from relevant BH3 domains. In some embodiments, a provided compound exhibit selectivity for Mcl-1 over Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. Assay [00911] Compound affinity was measured using a fluorescence polarization anisotropy competition assay. Anisotropy measurements were carried out in 384-well, black, flat- bottom plates (Greiner Bio-one, Monroe, NC, USA). The assay was run using either a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled BH3 peptide derived from Bak (FITC-AHx- GQVGRQLAIIGDDINR-NH2) or a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled BH3 peptide derived from Bim (FITC-AHx- EARIAQELRRIGDEFNETYTR -NH2) that were purchased from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) at >95% purity and used without further purification. 10 nM FITC-Bak peptide and 15 nM recombinant Mcl-1 (residues 172-327) were added to assay buffer (3 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5). The Bim based assay was run with 1 nM FITC-Bim peptide and 1.5 nM recombinant Mcl-1 (residues 172-327) added to assay buffer (20 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM DTT, 0.01% CHAPS). For selectivity assays, 40 nM Bcl-2 (residues i_207A96T'G110R, Î35-91, replaced with Bcl-xL35-5o) or 4 nM Bcl-xL (residues 1-209, loop 45-86 deleted) were incubated with 10 nM FITC-Bak in assay buffer. [00912] Compounds are diluted in DMSO in a 10-point, 3-fold serial dilution scheme. For the FITC -BAK assay 2.5 uL compound is added to 47.5 of assay buffer containing FITC-Bak and protein, for a final DMSO concentration of 5% and a top concentration of 20 Î¼Î. A FITC-Bak peptide alone (100% inhibition) and peptide plus protein (0 % inhibition) control is included on each assay plate. For the FITC -Bim assay, compound is added to 40 uL of assay buffer containing protein, 15 minutes prior to addition of 10 Î¼Ï^ of the FITC-Bim peptide, for a final DMSO concentration of 0.165% and a top concentration of 200 nM. A FITC-Bim peptide alone (100 % inhibition) and peptide plus protein (0 % inhibition) control is included on each assay plate. The plate was mixed and incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature. Anisotropy is measured at excitation wavelength 480 nm and emission wavelength 535 nm using an EnVision Multi-label plate reader (PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA, USA) or a BioTek Cytation 3 (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Fluorescence anisotropy is plotted against compound concentration to generate an IC50 (inhibitor concentration at which 50% of bound peptide is displaced) by fitting the data to a 4-parameter logistic model using XLFit software (Guildford, Surrey, UK). IC50 is converted to a binding dissociation constant (Â¾ value) according to the formula of Wang Z. FEBS Lett (1996) 3, 245. ^ pwaLWKd + pvKd + i) where [I] 50 is the concentration of the free inhibitor at 50% inhibition, [L]so is the concentration of the free labeled ligand at 50% inhibition, [P]o is the concentration of the free protein at 0% inhibition, Â¾ represents the dissociation constant of the FITC peptide probe.
