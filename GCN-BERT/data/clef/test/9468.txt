Step 3: 8-Chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one
2-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-8-chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one (0.077 g, 0.138 mmol) in THF (2 ml) was added a 1 M solution of TBAF in THF (0.207 ml, 0.207 mmol) at 0° C. The reaction was stirred at 0° C. for 1 hour. It was quenched with water and diluted in EtOAc. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (0-5% MeOH in DCM) to give the title compound (0.031 g, 46% yield).
