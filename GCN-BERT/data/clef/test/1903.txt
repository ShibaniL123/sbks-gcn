3H-THIENO[3,4]PYRIMIDIN-4-ONEAND PYRROLOPYRIMID-4-ONE AS GRAM-POSITIVE ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS The invention relates to novel heteroaromatic derivatives, their preparation and intermediates, their use as drugs and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The invention particularly relates to new compounds capable of inhibiting the activity of the Gram-positive bacterial DltA enzyme and their use to prevent and/or treat Gram-positive bacterial infections in humans or animals. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has become a serious worldwide healthcare problem. Indeed, some infections are now caused by multi-drug resistant organisms that are no longer responsive to currently available treatments. This issue has led to the search for innovative antibacterial approaches with novel modes of action. Among them the inhibition of virulence targets, a concept called antivirulence, is aiming at lessening or inhibiting the pathogenicity of a bacterium to its host (Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008, 12, 1). Potential advantages of this strategy over classical treatments lay in the preservation of the commensal flora as well as a selection pressure confined to the host tissues where the targeted virulence factor is essential for bacterial survival. It is known that the extracellular bacteria responsible for serious infections are capable of growth in the extra cellular fluids and are resistant to the bactericidal action of the host innate immunity. This resistance of bacteria to the innate immunity components allows dissemination of the infection, via the blood, to the various tissues. The components of the innate immunity are either circulating molecules such as the complement factors, or the antibacterial peptides such as defensins, which could have bactericidal effects by direct interactions with the bacterium cell wall, or either circulating cells such as the polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) able to kill invading bacteria. Among the many virulence factors described to be important for bacteria to resist the innate immunity components are the mechanisms involved in resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMP). CAMP play a fundamental role in innate immune defenses, both through direct antimicrobial activity and through immunomodulatory effects (Boman et al., J Intern Med. 2003, 254(3), 197). The CAMP dominating targets are bacterial membranes and CAMP interact with negatively charged bacterial surface. One of the main mechanisms present in bacteria to decrease the negative charge of the cell wall is the addition of positively charged amino acid on structural element of the cell surface. The dlt operon is responsible for D-alanine modification of cell wall teichoic acids, and its suppression has been linked to attenuated virulence in mice (Peschel et al., J. Infect. Dis. 2002, 186, 214). Among the different proteins expressed by this operon, DltA is a D-alanine:D-alanyl carrier protein ligase acting as the first enzyme controlling the D-alanylation of the teichoic acids as major components of Gram-positive cell wall: the lipoteichoic acids (LTA) and the wall teichoic acids (WTA). Mutant lacking the dltA gene resulted in the absence of D-Ala ester in the LTA (Poyart et al., J Bacterid. 2001 , 183, 6324). As a consequence, D-Ala deficient bacteria displayed a modification in the net charge of their cell surface and an increased susceptibility to various bactericidal compounds including cationic antimicrobial peptides and Vancomycin (FEBS Journal 2005, 272, 2993). Resistance to Daptomycin was shown to correlate with higher dltA expression, and higher level of wall teichoic acids D-Alanylation (Bertsche et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 201 1 55, 3922). Because the dlt operon is conserved in many Gram positive bacteria of medical relevance, such inhibitors would be useful in rendering invading bacteria sensitive to killing by the innate immunity mechanism of the host, allowing eradication or prevention of the infection by a new mechanism of action when compared to current antibiotic treatment. As antivirulent target, DltA is still largely unexploited at this time since there are no drugs on market nor on advanced clinical phases. Only very few derivatives that display a selective spectrum of activity on species containing DltA have been reported. The novel compounds of the present invention are based on innovative heteroaromatic bicyclic systems and unexpectedly display an especially interesting spectrum of activity on Gram-positive bacteria. The prior art is essentially constituted by derivatives as those described in WO2012172043A1 , Khimiya Geterotsiklicheskikh Soedinenii (1975), (7), 914-17, WO2008024978, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (2013), 56(20), 8073-8088, US75571 13, WO2005019219A1 , W09635689A1 and Journal of Organic Chemistry (1979), 44(22), 3826-9. To the knowledge of the applicant, only the purine derivatives described in WO2012172043A1 has been reported in the therapeutic domain of the invention. With respect to these purine derivatives, the level of activity of the compounds of the present invention is significantly higher. One of the purposes of the present invention is therefore to provide novel compounds active on DltA and related targets. Among other properties, these compounds advantageously modify the surface charge of the Gram-positive cell wall by inhibiting the D-Alanylation of the teichoic acids. As a consequence they can display synergistic effects with components of the innate immune system like CAMP such as alpha-defensins, beta-defensins or peptides of the cathelicidin family. As bacterial cell wall modifiers, they could also be associated and synergize with drugs aiming at treating bacterial infections such as compounds reinforcing the innate immunity of the host, or antibacterials and more specifically with compounds targeting the bacterial cell wall and/or membrane, or for which the bacterial cell wall and/or membrane are a limiting step for penetration. Such compounds include any antibiotics, and more specifically glycopeptides like vancomycin, lipopeptides like daptomycin, antimicrobial peptides like polymixins, cathelicidins, defensins or any synthetic or natural peptide derived from the above listed ones. The association of a DltA inhibitor and an antibacterial could, by lowering the active dose of the antibacterial, expand its therapeutic window.

Solutions for IV administration have been prepared by diluting 500 mg of compounds of example 13, 28, 51, 63, 73 or 81 in 100 mL of a 10%> solution of Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrine in water for injection. o Pharmacological study of the compounds of the invention The effect of the compounds of the invention on DltA enzymes has been based on the measure of their inhibition of DltA activity in vitro. To this end, recombinant proteins DltA were expressed and purified after cloning of the genes of S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium and S. agalactiae as described thereafter. The capacity of the compounds of the invention to inhibit DltA enzymatic activity was assessed using the DltA assays as described below: The dltA gene was amplified from chromosomal DNA of S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium and S. agalactiae and introduced into E. coli BL21 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following manufacturer's instruction. Bacteria were grown at 37°C under aerobic conditions and isopropyl-beta- D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to 0.5-1 mM when OD6oo of the bacterial culture had reached 0.5. After a further incubation for 3 hours, cells were harvested by centrifugation. Purification of the recombinant DltA protein was performed by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column following manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Fractions containing recombinant DltA protein were adjusted to 50%> glycerol and stored at -20°C until use. The binding potency of the inhibitors against DltA enzyme was assessed by IC5o determination in an in vitro DltA activity assay. The assay buffer "AB" contained 50 mM Hepes pH8.0, l OmM MgCl2, 50mM KC1, 0.012% Triton-Xl OO, l OmM DTT and Ι ΟΟηΜ Myelin-basic protein. The following components were added in a white polystyrene Costar plate up to a final volume of 30μΙ^: 3μΙ. DMSO, or inhibitor dissolved in DMSO and 27μΙ. DltA enzyme in AB. After 30min of pre- incubation at room temperature, 30μΙ. of Substrates mix in AB were added in each well to a final volume of 60μΙ^. This reaction mixture was then composed of DltA (produced in house from S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium and S. agalactiae), 0.5mM D-Alanine (Sigma), 0.5-5μΜ ATP (Sigma) and 0.05 u/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma) in assay buffer. After typically l-2hours of incubation at room temperature (conversion rate around 30%), 30μΕ of the revelation mix were added to a final volume of 90μΙ^, including the following constituents at the respective final concentrations: 10000 u/ml luciferase (Sigma), 30μΜ D-luciferin (Sigma), ΙΟΟμΜ N-acetylcysteamine (Aldrich). Luminescence intensity was immediately measured on a Fluostar Optima (BMG) (excitation 360nm, emission 520nm) and converted into inhibition percentages. For IC5o determinations (Inhibitory Concentration 50%) the inhibitor was added at 6 to 10 different concentrations and the related inhibitions were fitted to a classical Langmuir equilibrium model using XLFIT (IDBS). For compounds interfering with the luminescent signal (quenching), the same experiment without DltA enzyme was performed to allow quenching determination and correction. The effect of the compounds of the invention on controlling the bacterial D-alanylation of the wall teichoic acids (WTA) and lipoteichoic acids (LTA) has been based on the measure of their inhibition of bacterial D-alanylation in vitro. The strains used in this study were: S. aureus SA113, E. faecalis ATCC 29212, E. faecium (VRE) SF090703 and S. agalactiae NEM316. To this end, the compounds to be tested were prepared in deionised water / DMSO (60/40) solutions and distributed (75 μΐ) in a sterile deep-well culture microplate. The bacteria were grown on tryptic soy agar (TSA) over-night. Isolated colonies were cultured in 10ml of cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (ca-MHB) for the staphylococci and Todd-Hewitt + 0.5%) yeast extracts (THYE) for the streptococci and the enterococci up to an optical density (OD) typically of 0.15. These exponentially growing bacteria were finally diluted to 5e5 cfu/ml and added in each well (1.425ml) for incubation with the compounds at 37°C, with 5%> C02 for streptococci and enterococci. After 16-20H culture, bacteria were pelleted, heat inactivated in 0.5ml MES 0.1M pH6.0 + TritonXlOO 0.1 %> for 30min at 100°C. Resulting mixture was centrifuged/washed 3 times in 0.25ml of MES 0.1M pH6.0. The resulting pellet of cell-wall extracts was resuspended in 0.5ml of a mild alkaline buffer TRIS 0.2M pH8.5 + 200μΜ TritonXlOO and heated for 3H at 60°C in an air oven to allow D-Alanine (D-Ala) hydrolysis from the teichoic acids. The mixture was finally centrifuged to perform D-Ala titration in the supernatant, and phosphate titration in the pellet. D-Ala content was measured with a coupled enzymatic assay using D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) and peroxidase (HRP) associated with Amplex-Red® as fluorophore (method modified from Kontinen et al., J. Biol. Chem 2000). Dosages were carried out in black polystyrene 96-well microplates in 100 μΐ final volume. Assay buffer was TRIS 0.2M pH8.5 + 200μΜ TritonXlOO. Reagents were added in the microplate in the following order: D-Ala samples (50μ1) or DAla scale for reference, Revelation mix (40μ1) containing FAD 5μΜ, HRP lu/ml, 5μΜ Amplex Red (final concentrations). Background signal was read at this point, followed by addition of 0.15u/ml DAAO (ΙΟμΙ). Plate was finally read approximately 90min later (Fluostar Optima from BMG, excitation at 544nm, emission at 590nm). Data treatment: background was subtracted from 90min-signal, then a D-Ala standard curve was established with the references, and used to convert signals into D-Ala concentrations for each sample. Finally, results were expressed in nmol DAla/sample. Phosphate (Pi) titration was adapted from Zhou et al. (J. Lipid Res., 1992, 33, 1233) and started by Pi hydrolysis from cell wall extracts: pellets coming from DAla hydrolysis were incubated for 2.5 hours in 1ml 0.9M H2SO4/O. I 6M HCIO4. Titrations were carried out in clear polystyrene plates in 200μ1 final volume. Reagents were added in the microplate in the following order: Pi hydrolysed samples or KH2P04 scale for reference (Ι ΟΟμΙ), Ammonium molybdate 6mM (50μ1), and Malachite green 0.12mM + Tween20 0.06% (50μ1). The OD at 620nm was read 20min later (Fluostar Optima from BMG). A Pi standard curve was established with the references, and used to convert samples signals into Pi concentrations. Finally, results were expressed in nmol Pi/sample. Final treatment: for each sample (treated and untreated), the normalised ratio DAla/Pi was calculated and used to calculate the inhibition percentages of D-Alanylation in the treated samples compared to the untreated ones. The EC50 was defined as the dose of DltA inhibitor leading to 50% inhibition of teichoic acids D-Alanylation for the considered strain.
