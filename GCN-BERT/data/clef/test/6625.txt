Example 5 Synthesis of 3, 7-dihydroxy-6-(ethyl-d3)-5-cholan-24-oic acid (compound 19)
3-hydroxy-6-(ethyl-d3)-7-keto-5-cholan-24-acid (65 mg, 0.15 mmol) was added sodium hydroxide aq. solution (50%, 200 mg) and water (3.0 ml) were added successively into a reaction flask. Under stirring, sodium borohydride (13 mg, 0.3 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 16 h at 100Â°C. Cooled down to room temperature and added 1N HCl to adjust pH 2-3. The precipitate was filtered, washed with purified water and dried to afford the target compound (51 mg, 78%).
