The process for the preparation of the present invention is simple and convenient. There are two steps for the preparation of the said composition of the present invention. First step: Preparation of the pre-concentrate of nanoemulsion The components of the self microemulsifying drug delivery system are pharmaceutically active agent thiocolchicoside, at least one oil component, at least one surfactant and at least one co-surfactant. Initially, thiocolchicoside is dissolved into oil component. Then other components of the system like surfactant and co-surfactant are added in mixture of drug containing oil phase. The whole system is mixed and stirred for longer time to get a uniform and homogeneous mixture. Second step: Incorporation of SMEDDS preconcentrate into a semisolid gel The pre-concentrate prepared from first step is to be incorporated into a semisolid gel formulation. Carbopol 980 NF is hydrated by dispersing in distilled water. Weighed quantity of SMEDDS preconcentrate is dispersed in distilled water to form a microemulsion. Microemulsion so formed is then added to Carbopol dispersion with constant stirring. pH of the dispersion is then adjusted to 7 to form a gel. > · «Ur JL ± Examples: Example 1: First step: For 1 gm of preconcentrate, 25 mg of Thiocolchicoside was dissolved in 390 mg of Capmul MCM C8 (Glyceryl Monocaprylate) under stirring. The mixture was stirred still clear and homogeneous system was obtained. Then mixture of surfactant; Cremaphore RH 40 (PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil) (390 mg) and co-solvent; Trnascutol Ρ (diethylene glycol monoethyl ethe) (195 mg) was added to the Thiocolchicoside containing oil phase with continuous stirring. Again the mixture was stirred still clear and homogeneous system was obtained. Second step: Pre-concentrate was then incorporated in to semisolid gel base. 100 mg of carbopol 980 NF was dispersed under stirring in 4.9 gm of purified water. 1 gm of pre-concentrate nanoemulsion composition was then dispersed in 5 ml of purified water. This dispersion was then added to 5 gm of carbopol dispersion prepared previously and mixed properly. pH of the dispersion was then adjusted to 7 to get gel. Particle size of the final composition was found to be 201 nm by dynamic light scattering as shown in figure 1. However, this is a hydrodynamic diameter of the globules which comprises the actual oil globule diameter and water surrounding the globules. To find out actual core diameter Small angle neutron scattering is useful. The core diameter of oil globules were found to be 6.5 nm as shown in figure 2. Example 2: First step: For 1 gm of preconcentrate, 25 mg of Thiocolchicoside was dissolved in 325 mg of Capmul MCM C8 (Glyceryl Monocaprylate) under stirring. The mixture was stirred still clear and homogeneous system was obtained. Then mixture of surfactant; Solutol HS-15 (Macrogol 15 Hydroxystearate) (325 mg) and co-surfactant; Tween 80 (Polysorbate 80) (325 mg) was added to the Thiocolchicoside containing oil phase with continuous stirring. Again the mixture was stirred still clear and homogeneous system was obtained. Second step: Pre-concentrate was then incorporated in to semisolid gel base. 100 mg of carbopol 980 NF was dispersed under stirring in 4.9 gm of purified water. 1 gm of pre-concentrate nanoemulsion composition was then dispersed in 5 ml of purified water. This dispersion was then added to 5 gm of carbopol dispersion prepared previously and mixed properly. pH of the dispersion was then adjusted to 7 to get gel. ηη t f k!>? D Ε ; LJ 7“i U51. 1.
