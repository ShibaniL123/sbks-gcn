GOVERNMENT RIGHTS This invention was made with government support under grants CA69926 and HL63535 awarded by The National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention. FIELD The invention relates generally to fluid enhanced ablation, such as the SERF™ ablation technique (Saline Enhanced Radio Frequency™ ablation), and more particularly relates to methods and devices for degassing fluid introduced into tissue during fluid enhanced ablation. BACKGROUND The use of thermal energy to destroy bodily tissue can be applied to a variety of therapeutic procedures, including the destruction of tumors. Thermal energy can be imparted to the tissue using various forms of energy, such as radio frequency electrical energy, microwave or light wave electromagnetic energy, or ultrasonic vibrational energy. Radio frequency (RF) ablation, for example, can be effected by placing one or more electrodes against or into tissue to be treated and passing high frequency electrical current into the tissue. The current can flow between closely spaced emitting electrodes or between an emitting electrode and a larger, common electrode located remotely from the tissue to be heated. One disadvantage with these techniques is that maximum heating often occurs at or near the interface between the therapeutic tool and the tissue. In RF ablation, for example, maximum heating can occur in the tissue immediately adjacent to the emitting electrode. This can reduce the conductivity of the tissue, and in some cases, can cause water within the tissue to boil and become water vapor. As this process continues, the impedance of the tissue can increase and prevent current from entering into the surrounding tissue. Thus, conventional RF instruments are limited in the volume of tissue that can be treated. Fluid enhanced ablation therapy, such as the SERF™ ablation technique (Saline Enhanced Radio Frequency™ ablation), can treat a greater volume of tissue than conventional RF ablation. The SERF ablation technique is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,328,735, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Using the SERF ablation technique, saline is passed through a needle and heated, and the heated fluid is delivered to the tissue immediately surrounding the needle. The saline helps distribute the heat developed adjacent to the needle and thereby allows a greater volume of tissue to be treated with a therapeutic dose of ablative energy. The therapy is usually completed once a target volume of tissue reaches a desired therapeutic temperature, or otherwise receives a therapeutic dose of energy. One problem that can arise in fluid enhanced ablation therapy is that gas dissolved in the fluid can come out of solution due to heating that occurs before or during its introduction into the volume of tissue to be treated. When gas comes out of solution, it introduces a compressible gas into a system otherwise filled with an incompressible fluid. The compliance of the compressible gas can introduce a number of complications into the fluid enhanced ablation system and, as the amount of compliance in the system increases, the efficiency and effectiveness of the treatment can decrease. For example, bubbles formed from gas coming out of solution in the fluid (e.g., as the result of localized super-heating of the fluid near an RF electrode) can affect the fluid flow rate since the gas bubbles are compressible and can absorb pressure created by a fluid pump. Variance in the fluid flow rate can, in turn, reduce the volume of tissue that can be treated and make ablation therapy less reliable and reproducible. Still further, introducing gas bubbles into tissue within the body can, in some circumstances, have unintended and undesirable medical consequences for a patient. Accordingly, there remains a need for improved devices and methods for fluid enhanced ablation therapy. SUMMARY Devices, systems, and methods are generally provided for improving ablation therapy by degassing fluid provided in conjunction with such therapy. In one embodiment of an ablation system, the system can include an elongate body, an ablation element, a heating assembly, and a fluid source. The elongate body can have proximal and distal ends, an inner lumen extending through the elongate body, and at least one outlet port formed in the elongate body and configured to deliver fluid to tissue surrounding the elongate body. The ablation element can be disposed along a length of the elongate body adjacent to the at least one outlet port, and it can be configured to heat tissue surrounding the ablation element when the elongate body is inserted into tissue. The heating assembly can be disposed within the inner lumen, adjacent to the ablation element, and it can be configured to heat fluid flowing through the inner lumen. The fluid source can be in fluid communication with the inner lumen such that fluid can be delivered from the fluid source and through the inner lumen. The fluid source can contain a volume of fluid that is at least partially degassed such that the fluid contains one or more gases having a predetermined pressure and mixture. A pump can be coupled to the fluid source and it can be configured to pump fluid from the fluid source and through the inner lumen of the elongate body. In some embodiments, a mass exchanger can be coupled to the fluid source and it can be configured to at least partially degas the fluid of the fluid source. The fluid source can include a syringe that is configured to couple to the elongate body for delivering fluid to the inner lumen. In some embodiments, the fluid can be saline. Further, a sensor can be included as part of the system. The sensor can be configured to measure an amount of gas in the fluid. In another exemplary embodiment of an ablation system, the system can include an elongate body, an ablation element, a heating assembly, and a mass exchanger. The elongate body can have proximal and distal ends, an inner lumen extending through the elongate body, and at least one outlet port formed in the elongate body and configured to deliver fluid to tissue surrounding the elongate body. The ablation element can be disposed along a length of the elongate body adjacent to the at least one outlet port, and it can be configured to heat tissue surrounding the ablation element when the elongate body is inserted into tissue. The heating assembly can be disposed within the inner lumen, adjacent to the ablation element, and it can be configured to heat fluid flowing through the inner lumen. The mass exchanger can be in fluid communication with fluid flowing through the inner lumen, and further, it can be configured to at least partially degas fluid flowing through the inner lumen. The mass exchanger can include a plurality of gas-permeable and fluid-impermeable tubes, as well as at least one outlet configured to couple to a gas source for adjusting the amount of gas in the fluid flowing through the plurality of gas-permeable and fluid-impermeable tubes. The gas source can include a vacuum source for removing gas from the fluid. Alternatively, the gas source can include one or more gases having a predetermined pressure and mixture. The mass exchanger can be disposed proximal of the heating assembly such that fluid is at least partially degassed before being heated by the heating assembly. In some embodiments, the mass exchanger can be disposed within a control unit coupled to a proximal end of the elongate body. The control unit can include a pump that is effective to pump fluid from a fluid source, through the mass exchanger, and into the inner lumen of the elongate body. The system can further include a sensor that can be configured to measure an amount of a gas in fluid after it flows through the mass exchanger. Methods for ablating tissue are also provided, and in one exemplary embodiment, the method can include inserting an elongate body into a tissue mass, delivering fluid that is at least partially degassed through an inner lumen of the elongate body, delivering energy to at least one heating assembly disposed within the inner lumen to heat the at least partially degassed fluid within the lumen, and delivering energy to an ablation element. The at least partially degassed fluid can contain one or more gases having a predetermined pressure and mixture. The fluid can flow through at least one outlet port in the elongate body and into the tissue mass. Further, delivering energy to an ablation element can occur simultaneously with delivering energy to the at least one heating assembly, to ablate the tissue mass. In some embodiments, prior to delivering the at least partially degassed fluid through the inner lumen, a pump can be activated to deliver fluid through a mass exchanger. The mass exchanger can at least partially degas the fluid, and the at least partially degassed fluid can flow from the mass exchanger and into the inner lumen of the elongate body. Delivering the at least partially degassed fluid through an inner lumen can include injecting the at least partially degassed fluid into a control unit and activating a pump to cause the pump to force the at least partially degassed fluid through the inner lumen. The fluid can include saline. Further, in some embodiments, prior to delivering at least partially degassed fluid through the inner lumen of the elongate body, a sensor can be operated to determine an amount of a gas in the at least partially degassed fluid. In another aspect, a method for ablating tissue is provided that includes contacting a tissue mass with an ablation element having at least one outlet port formed thereon, and delivering fluid through the at least one outlet port, where the fluid is at least partially degassed such that the fluid contains one or more gases having a predetermined pressure and mixture. The method further includes delivering energy to the ablation element to ablate the tissue mass.

Fluid Enhanced Ablation Systems The present invention is generally directed to degassed fluids used in conjunction with fluid enhanced ablation devices and treatments. Fluid enhanced ablation, as mentioned above, is defined by passing a fluid into tissue while delivering therapeutic energy from an ablation element. The delivery of therapeutic energy into tissue can cause hyperthermia in the tissue, ultimately resulting in necrosis. This temperature-induced selective destruction of tissue can be utilized to treat a variety of conditions including tumors, fibroids, cardiac dysrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, etc.), and others. Fluid enhanced ablation, such as the SERF™ ablation technique (Saline Enhanced Radio Frequency™ ablation) described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,328,735 and incorporated by reference above, delivers fluid heated to a therapeutic temperature into tissue along with ablative energy. Delivering heated fluid enhances the ablation treatment because the fluid flow through the extracellular space of the treatment tissue can increase the heat transfer through the tissue by more than a factor of twenty. The flowing heated fluid therefore convects thermal energy from the ablation energy source further into the target tissue. In addition, the fact that the fluid is heated to a therapeutic temperature increases the amount of energy that can be imparted into the tissue. The fluid can also be at least partially degassed, which can further enhance the effectiveness of the fluid application as described below. Finally, the fluid can also serve to constantly hydrate the tissue and prevent any charring and associated impedance rise. FIG. 1 illustrates a diagram of one exemplary fluid ablation system 100. The system includes an elongate body 102 configured for insertion into a target volume of tissue. The elongate body can have a variety of shapes and sizes according to the geometry of the target tissue. Further, the particular size of the elongate body can depend on a variety of factors including the type and location of tissue to be treated, the size of the tissue volume to be treated, etc. By way of example only, in one embodiment, the elongate body can be a thin-walled stainless steel needle between about 16- and about 18-gauge (i.e., an outer diameter of about 1.27 millimeters to about 1.65 millimeters), and having a length L (e.g., as shown in FIG. 2) that is approximately 25 cm. The elongate body 102 can include a pointed distal tip 104 configured to puncture tissue to facilitate introduction of the device into a target volume of tissue, however, in other embodiments the tip can be blunt and can have various other configurations. The elongate body 102 can be formed from a conductive material such that the elongate body can conduct electrical energy along its length to one or more ablation elements located along a distal portion of the elongate body. Emitter electrode 105 is an example of an ablation element capable of delivering RF energy from the elongate body. In some embodiments, the emitter electrode 105 can be a portion of the elongate body 102. For example, the elongate body 102 can be coated in an insulating material along its entire length except for the portion representing the emitter electrode 105. More particularly, in one embodiment, the elongate body 102 can be coated in 1.5 mil of the fluoropolymer Xylan™ 8840. The electrode 105 can have a variety of lengths and shape configurations. In one embodiment, the electrode 105 can be a 4 mm section of a tubular elongate body that is exposed to surrounding tissue. Further, the electrode 105 can be located anywhere along the length of the elongate body 105 (and there can also be more than one electrode disposed along the length of the elongate body). In one embodiment, the electrode can be located adjacent to the distal tip 104. In other embodiments, the elongate body can be formed from an insulating material, and the electrode can be disposed around the elongate body or between portions of the elongate body. In other embodiments, the electrode can be formed from a variety of other materials suitable for conducting current. Any metal or metal salt may be used. Aside from stainless steel, exemplary metals include platinum, gold, or silver, and exemplary metal salts include silver/silver chloride. In one embodiment, the electrode can be formed from silver/silver chloride. It is known that metal electrodes assume a voltage potential different from that of surrounding tissue and/or liquid. Passing a current through this voltage difference can result in energy dissipation at the electrode/tissue interface, which can exacerbate excessive heating of the tissue near the electrodes. One advantage of using a metal salt such as silver/silver chloride is that it has a high exchange current density. As a result, a large amount of current can be passed through such an electrode into tissue with only a small voltage drop, thereby minimizing energy dissipation at this interface. Thus, an electrode formed from a metal salt such as silver/silver chloride can reduce excessive energy generation at the tissue interface and thereby produce a more desirable therapeutic temperature profile, even where there is no liquid flow about the electrode. The electrode 105 or other ablation element can include one or more outlet ports 108 that are configured to deliver fluid from an inner lumen 106 extending through the elongate body 102 into surrounding tissue (as shown by arrows 109). Alternatively, the electrode 105 can be positioned near one or more outlet ports 108 formed in the elongate body 102. In many embodiments, it can be desirable to position the electrode adjacent to the one or more outlet ports to maximize the effect of the flowing fluid on the therapy. The outlet ports 108 can be formed in a variety of sizes, numbers, and pattern configurations. In addition, the outlet ports 108 can be configured to direct fluid in a variety of directions with respect to the elongate body 102. These can include the normal orientation (i.e., perpendicular to the elongate body surface) shown by arrows 109 in FIG. 1, as well as orientations directed proximally and distally along a longitudinal axis of the elongate body 102, including various orientations that develop a circular or spiral flow of liquid around the elongate body. Still further, in some embodiments, the elongate body 102 can be formed with an open distal end that serves as an outlet port. By way of example, in one embodiment, twenty-four equally-spaced outlet ports 108 having a diameter of about 0.4 mm can be created around the circumference of the electrode 105 using Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM). One skilled in the art will appreciate that additional manufacturing methods are available to create the outlet ports 108. In addition, in some embodiments, the outlet ports can be disposed along a portion of the elongate body adjacent to the electrode, rather than being disposed in the electrode itself. The inner lumen 106 that communicates with the outlet ports 108 can also house a heating assembly 110 configured to heat fluid as it passes through the inner lumen 106 just prior to being introduced into tissue. Furthermore, the portion of the elongate body located distal to the electrode 105 or other ablation element can be solid or filled such that the inner lumen 106 terminates at the distal end of the electrode 105. In one embodiment, the inner volume of the portion of the elongate body distal to the electrode is filled with a plastic plug that can be epoxied in place or held by an interference fit. In other embodiments, the portion of the elongate body distal to the electrode can be formed from solid metal and attached to the proximal portion of the elongate body by welding, swaging, or any other technique known in the art. Fluid can be supplied to the inner lumen 106 and heating assembly 110 from a fluid reservoir 112. The fluid can be at least partially degassed, as described in more detail below. In some embodiments, the fluid can be degassed prior to introduction into the reservoir of the system, while in some embodiments, such as the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, an apparatus 119 for degassing fluid can be incorporated into the system, as also described further below. The fluid reservoir 112, and the degassing apparatus 119 if provided, can be connected to the inner lumen 106 via a fluid conduit 114. The fluid conduit 114 can be, for example, flexible plastic tubing. The fluid conduit 114 can also be a rigid tube, or a combination of rigid and flexible tubing. Fluid can be urged from the fluid reservoir 112, into the degassing apparatus 119 if provided, and into the inner lumen 106 by a pump 116. The pump 116 can be a syringe-type pump that produces a fixed volume flow with advancement of a plunger (not shown). An example of such a pump is a Model 74900 sold by Cole-Palmer Corporation of Chicago, Ill. Other types of pumps, such as a diaphragm pump, may also be employed. The pump 116, and/or degassing apparatus 119 if provided, can be controlled by a power supply and controller 118. The power supply and controller 118 can deliver electrical control signals to the pump 116, and/or degassing apparatus 119 if provided, to cause the pump to produce a desired flow rate of fluid. The power supply and controller 118 can be connected to the pump 116 via an electrical connection 120. The power supply and controller 118 can also be electrically connected to the elongate body 102 via connection 122, and to a collector electrode 124 via connection 126. In addition, the power supply and controller 118 can be connected to one or more of the heating assembly 110, the degassing apparatus 119 if provided, and/or a sensor (not shown) for determining one or more parameters of the fluid, such as an amount or a percentage of gas in the fluid, if provided, through similar electrical connections (not shown). The pump 116, power source and controller 118, degassing apparatus 119, and other components can generally be considered as part of a control unit for at least partially degassing and pumping fluid to a treatment site. The collector electrode 124 can have a variety of forms. For example, the collector electrode 124 can be a large electrode located outside a patient's body. In other embodiments, the collector electrode 124 can be a return electrode located elsewhere along the elongate body 102, or it can be located on a second elongate body introduced into a patient's body near the treatment site. In operation, the power supply and controller 118 can drive the delivery of fluid through a degassing apparatus, if provided, and into target tissue at a desired flow rate, the heating of the fluid to a desired therapeutic temperature, and the delivery of therapeutic ablative energy via the one or more ablation elements, such as electrode 105. To do so, the power supply and controller 118 can itself comprise a number of components for generating, regulating, and delivering required electrical control and therapeutic energy signals. For example, the power supply and controller 118 can include one or more frequency generators to create one or more RF signals of a given amplitude and frequency. These signals can be amplified by one or more RF power amplifiers into relatively high-voltage, high-amperage signals, e.g., 50 volts at 1 amp. These RF signals can be delivered to the ablation element via one or more electrical connections 122 and the elongate body 102 such that RF energy is passed between the emitter electrode 105 and the collector electrode 124 that can be located remotely on a patient's body. In embodiments in which the elongate body is formed from non-conductive material, the one or more electrical connections 122 can extend through the inner lumen of the elongate body or along its outer surface to deliver current to the emitter electrode 105. The passage of RF energy between the ablation element and the collector electrode 124 can heat the tissue surrounding the elongate body 102 due to the inherent electrical resistivity of the tissue. The power supply and controller 118 can also include a directional coupler to feed a portion of the one or more RF signals to, for example, a power monitor to permit adjustment of the RF signal power to a desired treatment level. The elongate body 102 illustrated in FIG. 1 can be configured for insertion into a patient's body in a variety of manners. FIG. 2 illustrates one embodiment of a medical device 200 having an elongate body 202 disposed on a distal end thereof configured for laparoscopic or direct insertion into a target area of tissue. In addition to the elongate body 202, the device 200 can include a handle 204 to allow an operator to manipulate the device. The handle 204 can include one or more electrical connections 206 that connect various components of the elongate body (e.g., the heating assembly and ablation element 205) to, for example, the power supply and controller 118 and the degassing apparatus 119, if provided, described above. The handle 204 can also include at least one fluid conduit 208 for connecting a fluid source to the device 200. While device 200 is one exemplary embodiment of a medical device that can be adapted for use in fluid enhanced ablation, a number of other devices can also be employed. For example, a very small elongate body can be required in treating cardiac dysrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia. In such a case, an appropriately sized elongate body can be, for example, disposed at a distal end of a catheter configured for insertion into the heart via the circulatory system. In one embodiment, a stainless steel needle body between about 20- and about 25-gauge (i.e., an outer diameter of about 0.5 millimeters to about 0.9 millimeters) can be disposed at a distal end of a catheter. The catheter can have a variety of sizes but, in some embodiments, it can have a length of about 120 cm and a diameter of about 8 French (“French” is a unit of measure used in the catheter industry to describe the size of a catheter and is equal to three times the diameter of the catheter in millimeters). Therapeutic Treatment Using Fluid Enhanced Ablation Ablation generally involves the application of high or low temperatures to cause the selective necrosis and/or removal of tissue. There is a known time-temperature relationship in the thermal destruction of tissue accomplished by ablation. A threshold temperature for causing irreversible thermal damage to tissue is generally accepted to be about 41° Celsius (C). It is also known that the time required to achieve a particular level of cell necrosis decreases as the treatment temperature increases further above 41° C. It is understood that the exact time/temperature relationship varies by cell type, but that there is a general relationship across many cell types that can be used to determine a desired thermal dose level. This relationship is commonly referred to as an equivalent time at 43° C. expressed as: [in-line-formulae]teq.43° C.=∫R(T(t)−43°)dt (1)[/in-line-formulae] where T is the tissue temperature and R is a unit-less indicator of therapeutic efficiency in a range between 0 and 5 (typically 2 for temperatures greater than or equal to 43° C., zero for temperatures below 41° C., and 4 for temperatures between 41 and 43° C.), as described in Sapareto S. A. and W. C. Dewey, Int. J. Rad. Onc. Biol. Phys. 10(6):787-800 (1984). This equation and parameter set represents just one example of the many known methods for computing a thermal dose, and any of methodology can be employed with the methods and devices of the present invention. Using equation (1) above, thermal doses in the range of teq,43° C.==20 minutes to 1 hour are generally accepted as therapeutic although there is some thought that the dose required to kill tissue is dependent on the type of tissue. Thus, therapeutic temperature may refer to any temperature in excess of 41° C., but the delivered dose and, ultimately, the therapeutic effect are determined by the temporal history of temperature (i.e., the amount of heating the tissue has previously endured), the type of tissue being heated, and equation (1). For example, Nath, S. and Haines, D. E., Prog. Card. Dis. 37(4):185-205 (1995) (Nath et al.) suggest a temperature of 50° C. for one minute as therapeutic, which is an equivalent time at 43° C. of 128 minutes with R=2. In addition, for maximum efficiency, the therapeutic temperature should be uniform throughout the tissue being treated so that the thermal dose is uniformly delivered. FIG. 3 illustrates the performance profiles of several ablation techniques by showing a simulated temperature achieved at a given distance from an ablation element, such as electrode 105. The first profile 302 illustrates the performance of RF ablation without the use of fluid enhancement. As shown in the figure, the temperature of the tissue falls very sharply with distance from the electrode. This means that within 10 millimeters of the ablation element the temperature of the tissue is still approximately body temperature (37° C.), far below the therapeutic temperature of 50° C. discussed above. Furthermore, very close to the ablation element the temperature is very high, meaning that the tissue will more quickly desiccate, or dry up, and char. Once this happens, the impedance of the tissue rises dramatically, making it difficult to pass energy to tissue farther away from the ablation element. A second tissue temperature profile 304 is associated with a second prior art system similar to that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,431,649. In this second system, an electrode is inserted into tissue and imparts a 400 kHz RF current flow of about 525 mA to heat the tissue. Body temperature (37° C.) saline solution is simultaneously injected into the tissue at a rate of 10 ml/min. The resulting tissue temperature profile 304 is more uniform than profile 302, but the maximum temperature achieved anywhere is approximately 50° C. Thus, the temperature profile 304 exceeds the generally accepted tissue damaging temperature threshold specified for one minute of therapy in only a small portion of the tissue. As described above, such a small temperature increment requires significant treatment time to achieve any therapeutically meaningful results. A third tissue temperature profile 306 is achieved using the teachings of the present invention. In the illustrated embodiment, an electrode formed from silver/silver chloride is inserted into tissue and imparts a 480 kHz RF current flow of 525 mA to heat the tissue. Saline solution heated to 50° C. is simultaneously injected into the tissue at a rate of 10 ml/min. The resulting temperature profile 306 is both uniform and significantly above the 50° C. therapeutic threshold out to 15 millimeters from the electrode. Moreover, because the temperature is uniform within this volume, the thermal dose delivered is also uniform through this volume. The uniform temperature profile seen in FIG. 3 can be achieved by the introduction of heated fluid into the target tissue during application of ablative energy. The fluid convects the heat deeper into the tissue, thereby reducing the charring and impedance change in tissue that occurs near the ablation element, as shown in profile 302. Further, because the fluid is heated to a therapeutic level, it does not act as a heat sink that draws down the temperature of the surrounding tissue, as seen in profile 304. Therefore, the concurrent application of RF energy and perfusion of heated saline solution into the tissue eliminates the desiccation and/or vaporization of tissue adjacent to the electrode, maintains the effective tissue impedance, and increases the thermal transport within the tissue being heated with RF energy. The total volume of tissue that can be heated to therapeutic temperatures, e.g., greater than 41° C., is thereby increased. For example, experimental testing has demonstrated that a volume of tissue having a diameter of approximately 8 centimeters (i.e., a spherical volume of approximately 156 cm3) can be treated in 5 minutes using the fluid enhanced ablation techniques described herein. By comparison, conventional RF can only treat volumes having a diameter of approximately 3 centimeters (i.e., a spherical volume of approximately 14 cm3) in the same 5-minute time span. In addition, fluid enhanced ablation devices according to the present invention have a greater number of parameters that can be varied to adjust the shape of the treatment profile according to the tissue being treated. For example, when using the SERF ablation technique, an operator or control system can modify parameters such as saline temperature (e.g., from about 40° C. to about 80° C.), saline flow rate (e.g., from about 0 ml/min to about 20 ml/min), the amount of degassing of the saline, RF signal power (e.g., from about 0 W to about 100 W), and duration of treatment (e.g., from about 0 minutes to about 10 minutes) to adjust the temperature profile 306 and improve the reproducibility of the therapy. In addition, different electrode configurations can also be used to vary the treatment. For example, although the emitter electrode 105 illustrated in FIG. 1 is configured as a continuous cylindrical band adapted for a mono-polar current flow, the electrode can also be formed in other geometries, such as spherical or helical, that form a continuous surface area, or the electrode may have a plurality of discrete portions. The electrodes may also be configured for bipolar operation, in which one electrode (or a portion of an electrode) acts as a cathode and another electrode (or portion thereof) acts as an anode. A preferred fluid for use in the SERF ablation technique is sterile normal saline solution (defined as a salt-containing solution). However, other liquids may be used, including Ringer's solution, or concentrated saline solution. A fluid can be selected to provide the desired therapeutic and physical properties when applied to the target tissue and a sterile fluid is recommended to guard against infection of the tissue. The fluid can be further enhanced by at least partially removing a one or more dissolved gases from the fluid, such that the fluid contains one or more gases having a predetermined pressure and mixture. In some embodiments, this predetermined pressure and mixture can be less than a predetermined value for one or more of the gases. The remaining portions of the description are directed primarily to devices and methods for degassing fluid used in conjunction with fluid enhanced ablation therapy. Fluid Degassing Fluids commonly include one or more dissolved gases that can, under certain conditions, come out of solution in the form of gas bubbles. Exemplary gases commonly dissolved in fluid include oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other gases present in the atmosphere. Dissolved gases come out of solution according to the ability of a fluid to hold a particular gas in solution at a given temperature and pressure. This relationship is governed by Henry's Law, which states that at a particular temperature, the amount of a particular gas that dissolves in a particular type and volume of liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas in equilibrium with the liquid. In other words, the amount of a gas that can be dissolved in a fluid depends on the temperature of the fluid, the pressure of the gas in the environment surrounding the fluid, as well as the type and volume of the fluid. For example, water and saline are commonly able to hold less gas in solution as the temperature of the fluid is increased. The increased kinetic energy of the gas molecules in the solution causes them to more easily escape the solution, resulting in lowered solubility. In fluid enhanced ablation, fluid is heated just prior to introduction into tissue. The heating process reduces the solubility of the dissolved gases, resulting in one or more gases coming out of solution in the form of gas bubbles. These bubbles can form, for example, inside the inner lumen and can subsequently exit the outlet ports 108 into the tissue surrounding the elongate body 102. Furthermore, gas bubbles may also form just outside the elongate body due to heating from the emitter electrode 105. Gases that come out of solution during ablation therapy can have a detrimental effect on the control, and therefore the effectiveness, of the fluid supplied to the treatment site. This is primarily because the gas bubbles formed in the fluid are compressible, while the fluid itself is not. This compressibility, or compliance, is undesirable in a fluid enhanced ablation system. For example, a pump can be designed to advance a plunger on a fluid-filled syringe at a particular speed so as to induce a particular flow rate. As long as the fluid path contains only incompressible fluid, the flow rate can be maintained as a constant despite changes in back-pressure that can be caused by physiologic changes in the tissue, or by changes in fluid resistivity due to ablation therapy. However, if the fluid contains compressible gas bubbles, an increase in back-pressure from the tissue may alter the flow rate because the changing pressure can, at least in part, be absorbed by the compressible gas bubbles. Accordingly, any possible compliance of the fluid used in fluid enhanced ablation therapy should be reduced. This can be accomplished, for example, by removing at least some of the dissolved gas in the fluid. Removing dissolved gas from the fluid can increase the temperature at which gas comes out of solution, thereby reducing the compliance of a fluid enhanced ablation system in which the fluid is used. Using degassed fluids can increase the effectiveness, reproducibility, and overall reliability of fluid enhanced ablation systems. Gas can be removed from the fluid in a variety of ways, some of which are described in greater detail below. These methods include degassing using one or more chemicals, boiling the fluid, exposing the fluid to a vacuum, and exposing the fluid to a gas having a desired gas concentration. While methods to remove gas from the fluid can be applied to remove substantially all of the gas within the fluid, in some embodiments it can be desirable to maintain some of the gas in the fluid. For example, in some instances it may be desirable to maintain some level of oxygen in the fluid or some level of carbon dioxide in the fluid. By way of non-limiting example, in one embodiment, it can be desirable to degas a fluid to a partial pressure of oxygen (O2) in a range of about 20 mm to about 40 mm of mercury. These levels of oxygen can prevent the complete oxygen deprivation of tissues being treated with fluid enhanced ablation. Accordingly, the devices and methods of the present invention can be utilized to at least partially degas a fluid such that the fluid contains a predetermined concentration of a particular gas. In some embodiments, this can be accomplished by degassing a fluid such that the fluid contains less than a predetermined partial pressure of a particular gas. The predetermined partial pressure can be set as desired by a user. Chemical degassing can be performed by adding one or more chemicals to the fluid that bind or otherwise react with dissolved gases within the fluid. The chemicals can be formulated or configured to remove one or more gases from the fluid. A person skilled in the art will recognize various chemicals or groups of chemicals that can target and remove one or more gases from the fluid. For example, oxygen can be selectively removed from a fluid by introducing a reductant, such as ammonium sulfite, into the fluid. Degassing a fluid by boiling can be performed by heating the fluid for a period of time up to or above a temperature that can cause one or more gases to be removed. As the fluid heats up, its ability to hold gas in solution will decrease, and the gases within the fluid can begin to come out of solution and dissipate from the system. By way of example only, a volume of degassed saline having a desired salinity can be created by starting with diluted saline (e.g., saline diluted with water) and boiling the diluted saline until the remaining liquid has a desired salinity. Boiling a fluid can be effective to remove a portion of all gasses within the fluid. Specific gases, however, can be more difficult to target using this method because the application of heat to the fluid can act on all gases within the fluid. However, different gasses can dissipate at different rates at the same temperature. Thus, selectively controlling the heating of a fluid can be effective to at least partially target the removal of a particular gas from the fluid. The fluid can be heated or boiled for any amount of time, depending at least in part on the desired percent gas concentration and the temperature to which the fluid is heated, however, in some embodiments the fluid can be heated to its boiling point for about 30 minutes. An additional method for degassing a fluid includes exposing the fluid to a vacuum source, i.e., applying a vacuum to the fluid. Similar to boiling, applying a vacuum to a fluid can be effective to remove a portion of all gases within the fluid. While exemplary apparatuses for applying a vacuum to fluid are described in greater detail below, including apparatuses such as mass exchangers, a vacuum source can generally draw gas from the fluid by reducing the atmospheric pressure surrounding the fluid, thereby drawing gas out of solution by equilibration forces. For instance, the fluid can be in a chamber and a vacuum source can be coupled to the chamber so that the vacuum source can apply a vacuum to the fluid within the chamber. The fluid can be exposed to a vacuum for any amount of time, depending at least in part on the desired percent gas concentration and a strength of the vacuum force applied to the fluid, however, in some embodiments the fluid can be exposed to a vacuum for at least about eight hours. This process can be accelerated by agitating the liquid while exposed to the vacuum to cause cavitation or to increase the surface area of the liquid contacting the vacuum. Yet a further method for degassing a fluid includes exposing the fluid to one or more gas sources that contain a gas having a desired gas concentration, i.e., applying one or more gasses to the fluid. This is a variation on the vacuum concept, in which a vacuum (or “negative”) gas source is employed to draw gas out of solution. By exposing a fluid to a particular concentration of gas for a period of time, the concentration of gas in the fluid can begin to equilibrate with the gas source so that the percentage of gas in the fluid approaches, and can eventually equal, the percentage of gas present in the gas source. Some exemplary apparatuses for applying a gas to a fluid are described in greater detail below, including mass exchangers. In some embodiments, the fluid can be in a chamber and a gas source can be coupled to the chamber so that the gas source can be in fluid communication with the chamber. When the fluid is within a chamber and gas is applied thereto, the chamber can be vented to allow excess gas that comes out of solution to escape. Further, the fluid and/or the gas being applied to the fluid can be agitated to speed up the equilibration process. A person skilled in the art will recognize a number of different ways by which agitation can be imparted on the system, for example, by applying a rotational force to either or both of the fluid chamber and the gas chamber. A gas source applied to a fluid can contain a given concentration of a single gas, or a combination of a plurality of gases at particular partial pressures. Multiple gases can be applied to the fluid at the same time or in succession to achieve a desired concentration of one or more gases within the fluid. The fluid can be exposed to one or more of the gas sources for any amount of time, depending at least in part on the desired gas concentrations within the fluid and the gas concentrations of the applied gas. For example, in some embodiments the fluid can be exposed to a gas including a partial pressure of oxygen between about 20 mm and about 40 mm of mercury. As described above, exposing the fluid to such a gas can result in the fluid equilibrating until the fluid contains a partial pressure of oxygen that is also between about 20 mm and about 40 mm of mercury. Other gas sources can be utilized as well, or a single gas source having a predetermined concentration and mixture of a plurality of gases can be utilized. For example, in some embodiments it can be desirable to utilize a gas source that includes not only oxygen, but also carbon dioxide, as it can aid in maintaining the pH of the fluid. In such an embodiment, a gas source that includes a partial pressure of carbon dioxide between about 35 and about 40 mm of mercury can be utilized as a gas source. Degassing in the Ablation Process Fluid degassing can be performed at a number of different times in conjunction with fluid enhanced ablation therapy. In some embodiments, the fluid can be degassed prior to delivering the fluid into a reservoir. In such embodiments, the fluid can be degassed and then inserted into the fluid reservoir. Fluid degassed prior to introduction into the fluid reservoir can be sealed in an airtight container to prevent gas from re-entering into solution. Alternatively, the fluid can be degassed while in the fluid reservoir. In some embodiments, a fluid reservoir containing fluid that is at least partially degassed can be provided in a sterile container and/or can be pre-packaged in sterile packaging. The container can then be coupled to a fluid enhanced ablation therapy system. For example, degassed fluid can be loaded in a syringe and pre-packaged for use with a fluid enhanced ablation therapy system. In such embodiments, a sensor can be provided to gauge the concentration of a gas in a fluid. Gauging the concentration of a gas in a sealed fluid reservoir can be desirable to ensure that a faulty seal has not allowed gas to re-enter into solution in the fluid. Exemplary sensors are discussed in more detail below. Alternatively, an apparatus for degassing fluid as shown in FIG. 1 can be provided in conjunction with the fluid enhanced ablation therapy system. The fluid reservoir 112 can provide fluid to the degassing apparatus 119, the apparatus 119 can degas the fluid flowing therethrough using the methods described herein or other methods for degassing fluid, and then the fluid can flow through the conduit 114 and into the elongate body 102 for use in ablation. In still further alternative embodiments, the degassing apparatus 119 can be disposed upstream of the fluid reservoir 112 such that fluid is supplied from an initial source (not shown), passed through the degassing apparatus 119 for purposes of degassing the fluid, and the fluid can then be stored in the fluid reservoir 112 for use proximate to the treatment site as described above. Some exemplary embodiments of apparatuses for use in degassing fluid are described in greater detail below. Effects of Saline Degassing FIG. 4 illustrates the performance profiles of saline that was not degassed (labeled as “regular saline”) and saline that was at least partially degassed. To produce the results shown in FIG. 4, degassed saline was obtained by boiling 600 ml of regular saline and 200 ml of pure water together for approximately 30 minutes. The boiling was allowed to continue until 600 ml of saline remained. The hot saline was then sealed in a flask and cooled. This created a partial vacuum, which helped to prevent atmospheric gas from dissolving back into the newly degassed saline. This procedure produced 600 ml of saline with measured dissolved oxygen levels of approximately 1 mg/L. The same saline, at equilibrium at room temperature and pressure, typically contains approximately 8 mg/L of dissolved oxygen. The chart shows the approximate diameter of lesions created using saline with the two different concentrations of dissolved gas at different therapy settings of saline temperature and RF power level. The experiments for the two saline gas concentrations involved a 10 ml/min rate of flow and each experiment was replicated five times. The results illustrate the mean lesion diameter for various temperatures and power levels, and the standard deviation for the same. As shown, the degassed saline allows for lesions of larger diameters to be achieved across a range of temperature and power levels. As the amount of RF power increases and/or saline temperature increases—both conditions under which gas is more likely to come out of solution—the disparity increases between the lesion sizes created with degassed saline and those created with regular saline. The degassed saline shows an ability to consistently achieve larger and less variable lesion diameters. Accordingly, the use of at least partially degassed saline in fluid enhanced ablation therapy can contribute significantly to the reliability and effectiveness of the treatment, especially at higher power levels and temperatures. Apparatuses for Degassing Fluid Just as fluid can be degassed in a variety of manners, a number of different apparatuses can be used to degas fluid. Exemplary apparatuses can include a container or chamber in which the fluid is disposed and the degassing methods discussed above applied directly thereto (e.g., applying a chemical, vacuum, or gas to the chamber and/or heating the chamber as described above), or the apparatus can be more elaborate, such as a mass exchanger. An exemplary mass exchanger is the Cell-Pharm® Hollow-Fiber Oxygenator manufactured by CD Medical. One exemplary embodiment of an apparatus 310 for use in degassing fluid is illustrated in FIGS. 5-7. The apparatus 310 shown in FIGS. 5-7 is a mass exchanger having a plurality of tubes 330 that are gas permeable and substantially fluid impermeable. The apparatus 310 can include an inlet 312 for receiving fluid to be treated (i.e., have at least a portion of gas removed therefrom), an outlet 314 for ejecting treated fluid, and a treatment chamber 316 disposed therebetween. The treatment chamber 316 can include one or more tubes 330 in fluid communication with the inlet 312 and the outlet 314 such that fluid can flow from the inlet 312, through the tubes 330, and out of the outlet 314. In the illustrated embodiment, the tubes 330 are disposed at each end in proximal and distal discs 320, 322. The proximal disc 320 can block fluid from flowing through the treatment chamber 316 such that fluid that enters through the inlet 312 can only pass through the chamber 316 via the tubes 330. Likewise, the distal disc 322 can prevent fluid that passes across the chamber 316 via the tubes 330 from back-flowing into the chamber 316. One or more gas outlets or ports 340, 342 can be part of the chamber 316. The gas ports 340, 342 can allow various components, such as a vacuum source 350 (FIG. 6) or a gas source 360 (FIG. 7), to be connected to the treatment chamber 316 such that that the components 350, 360 can be in fluid communication with the treatment chamber 316. The gas sources 350, 360 can then be operated as described herein to at least partially degas the fluid. The ports 340, 342 can be selectively opened and closed based on a desired treatment of the fluid flowing through the tubes 330. In some embodiments, a sensor 370 for determining at least one parameter of a fluid flowing through the apparatus 310 can be disposed at or proximate to the outlet 314. The sensor 370 can be configured to measure any number of parameters, but in some exemplary embodiments the sensor 370 can be configured to measure a concentration of gas in a fluid passing through the outlet 314. A housing 318 of the apparatus 310, in which the treatment chamber 316 is disposed, can be sized and shaped in any number of ways so that fluid can flow therethrough while at least a portion of a gas dissolved within the fluid can be removed. As shown in the figure, the housing 318 is generally cylindrical and is sized to allow the plurality of tubes 330 to be spatially disposed therein. The housing 318 can be larger than the respective inlet 312 and outlet 314 disposed near the proximal and distal ends 318p, 318d of the housing 318, as shown, or the housing can have the same or a smaller outer diameter than the inlet and/or outlet. The inlet 312 and the outlet 314 can likewise be sized and shaped in any number of ways, and as shown they are generally cylindrical and sized to allow fluid to flow therethrough. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the dimensions of any of these components can vary depending on the location of the apparatus in the fluid delivery system. The one or more tubes 330 disposed in the treatment chamber 316 can be gas permeable and substantially fluid impermeable. Thus, fluid that enters the tubes 330 can generally flow through the tubes 330, while gases disposed in the fluid can dissipate out of the tubes 330 when particular environments are produced within the treatment chamber 316 (e.g., by the application of a vacuum or other gas source). Many different materials can be used to form gas permeable and substantially fluid impermeable walls, including, for example, microporous polyethylene fibers or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), such as is available from W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc. The tubes 330 can be sized and shaped in any number of ways, but as shown the tubes 330 are generally elongate, extend substantially across a length of the treatment chamber 316, and are substantially cylindrical in shape. Space can be provided between the tubes 330 so that gas removed from fluid flowing through the tubes 330 can dissipate into the treatment chamber 316 and possibly out of one of the gas ports 340, 342, discussed in more detail below. Any number of tubes 330 can be used, with the flow rate of the fluid being based, at least in part, on the number and diameter of the tubes 330. The discs 320, 322 can be configured in a manner that allows the treatment chamber 316 to be separated from the inlet 312 and outlet 314. Thus, fluid entering the inlet 312 can generally only flow across the treatment chamber 316 by passing through the tubes 330 and cannot generally enter the chamber 316 through the inlet 312 or by back-flowing into the chamber 316 near the outlet 314. Accordingly, a diameter of the discs 320, 322 can be substantially equal to an inner diameter of the housing 318 at the proximal and distal ends 318p, 318d of the housing 318. Further, a connection between the ends of the tubes 330 and the discs 320, 322 in which the tubes 330 can be disposed can generally be fluid-tight such that fluid cannot generally flow into the chamber 316 between the tubes 330 and the respective disc 320, 322. While a variety of materials can be used to form the discs 320, 322, in one exemplary embodiment an epoxy is used to form the discs 320, 322. The gas ports 340, 342 can generally be configured to allow a vacuum or gas to be applied to the treatment chamber 316 between the proximal and distal discs 320, 322. Thus, the ports 340, 342 can be in fluid communication with the treatment chamber 316. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the ports 340, 342 are open, but in one exemplary use, shown in FIG. 6, a vacuum source 350 can be coupled to one of the ports 342 and the other port 340 can be closed so that a vacuum can be created within the treatment chamber 316. Applying a vacuum to the treatment chamber 316 can draw gas from fluid passing through the tubes 330 through the gas-permeable walls of the tubes 330 and into the treatment chamber 316. As discussed above, the vacuum source 350 can be applied to create a desired percent concentration of gas in the fluid passing through the tubes 330. In another exemplary use of the ports 340, 342, shown in FIG. 7, a gas source 360 can be coupled to one of the ports 342 and the other port 342 can remain open. The gas source 360 can have a desired concentration level of one or more particular gases. As the gas is supplied to the treatment chamber 316, the gas in the chamber 316 and the gas in the fluid can begin to equilibrate. Excess gas from the fluid can dissipate out of the fluid, through the gas-permeable walls of the tubes 330, and into the chamber 316. As the system continues to equilibrate, excess gas can flow out of the open gas port 342, thus creating a substantially uniform percent concentration of gas in the fluid flowing through the tubes 330 and the chamber 316. As described above, any number of gases can be supplied simultaneously or consecutively to achieve various percent concentrations of gas in the fluid. The sensor 370 at the distal end of the apparatus 310 can be any number of sensors and it can be configured to measure any number of parameters of the system. In one exemplary embodiment, the sensor 370 can be configured to measure a percent concentration of gas in a fluid located proximate to the outlet 314. For example, the sensor 370 can be an oxygen sensor. While the sensor 370 is shown in the distal end 318d of the housing 318, in other embodiments one or more sensors 370 can be disposed in other locations of the apparatus 310, or in other portions of the system. By way of non-limiting example, a sensor for measuring parameters such as the percent concentration of gas in a fluid can be disposed in the elongate body 102, proximate to the treatment site (FIG. 1). While sample shapes and sizes are provided herein for the various components of the apparatus 310, a person skilled in the art will recognize that the size and shape of the apparatus 310 and its components can depend on a number of factors, including, at least in part, the size and shape of the other components. For example, a size of the components of the degassing apparatus 310 that is used in conjunction with a fluid enhanced ablation therapy system can be sized relative to the other fluid enhanced ablation therapy system components, while a size of the components of the degassing apparatus 310 that is used to degas the fluid prior to associating a fluid reservoir with the fluid enhanced ablation therapy system can be larger because its size does not need to generally account for the size of other components of the fluid enhanced ablation therapy system. Integration into Ablation Systems In embodiments in which the fluid is degassed separately from the fluid enhanced ablation system, the system can operate in a manner as described with respect to FIG. 1 but with the degassing apparatus 119 being separate from the system. The fluid can be degassed in any number of manners as described herein or otherwise known in the art, and then it can be coupled to or delivered into the fluid enhanced ablation system for application proximate to the treatment site. In embodiments in which the fluid is degassed as part of the fluid enhanced ablation therapy system, the system can operate in a manner similar as described with respect to FIG. 1. The degassing apparatus 310, or equivalents thereof, can be supplied as the degassing apparatus 119 of FIG. 1. Accordingly, fluid can be pumped from the fluid reservoir 112 by the pump 116 into the inlet 312 of the degassing apparatus 310. The fluid can then pass across the treatment chamber 316 via the tubes 330 and into the outlet 314. As the fluid flows through the tubes 330, degassing forces, such as a force supplied by a vacuum source and/or another gas source, can be applied to the fluid so that gas can be selectively removed from the fluid in the tubes 330. Fluid from the outlet can then continue to be pumped by the pump 116 into the conduit 114 for application proximate to the treatment site. Methods of Use As described above, the various embodiments of the devices and systems disclosed herein can be utilized in a variety of surgical procedures to treat a number of medical conditions. For example, medical devices as disclosed herein can be configured for insertion into a target volume of tissue directly during an open surgical procedure or during percutaneous ablation therapy. Alternatively, the medical devices can be configured to be passed through one or more layers of tissue during a laparoscopic or other minimally invasive procedure. Furthermore, the devices can be configured for introduction into a patient via an access port or other opening formed through one or more layers of tissue, or via a natural orifice (i.e., endoscopically). Depending on the device employed, delivery may be facilitated by directly inserting the elongate body as shown in FIG. 2, or by introducing a catheter containing an elongate body through, for example, a patient's circulatory system. Following delivery to a treatment site, a portion of a surgical device, e.g., a distal portion of the elongate body 102, can be inserted into a target treatment volume such that an ablation element is disposed within the treatment volume. In some embodiments, the ablation element can be positioned near the center of the treatment volume. Once the device is positioned within the treatment volume, fluid can be delivered through the device into the treatment volume. The heating assemblies disclosed herein can be utilized to deliver fluid, such as the at least partially degassed fluid disclosed herein, at a therapeutic temperature, as described above. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the fluid can be delivered without first being heated to a therapeutic temperature. The fluid introduced into the target volume of tissue can be degassed on demand (e.g., as it flows from a reservoir to the treatment volume) by, for example, a degassing apparatus as described above, or can be degassed prior to storage in the fluid reservoir. Furthermore, the amount of degassing can be tested using, for example, a sensor either prior to or during ablation therapy. In addition to delivering fluid to the treatment volume, one or more ablation elements can be activated to simultaneously deliver therapeutic energy, such as RF energy, into the tissue in the treatment volume. In some embodiments, however, the one or more ablation elements need not be activated, and therapy can be administered by delivering therapeutically heated fluid from the elongate body alone. After a period of time, or depending on one or more feedback indications (e.g., a reading from a temperature sensor disposed within the treatment volume), the ablation element can be deactivated and the flow of fluid into the volume can be stopped. The device can then be removed and/or repositioned if additional therapy is required. In other embodiments, degassed fluid can also be utilized with other types of ablation procedures. For example, unheated degassed fluid can be introduced through a conventional shower-head ablation electrode that is configured to contact, but not penetrate, a treatment volume. The use of a degassed fluid can still be advantageous when utilizing unheated fluid because the fluid can still experience heating in the vicinity of the ablation element. Sterilization and Reuse The devices disclosed herein can be designed to be disposed after a single use, or they can be designed for multiple uses. In either case, however, the device can be reconditioned for reuse after at least one use. Reconditioning can include any combination of the steps of disassembly of the device, followed by cleaning or replacement of particular pieces, and subsequent reassembly. In particular, the device can be disassembled, and any number of the particular pieces or parts of the device can be selectively replaced or removed in any combination. Upon cleaning and/or replacement of particular parts, the device can be reassembled for subsequent use either at a reconditioning facility or by a surgical team immediately prior to a surgical procedure. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that reconditioning of a device can utilize a variety of techniques for disassembly, cleaning/replacement, and reassembly. Use of such techniques, and the resulting reconditioned device, are all within the scope of the present invention. For example, the surgical devices disclosed herein may be disassembled partially or completely. In particular, the elongate body 202 of the medical device 200 shown in FIG. 2 may be removed from the handle 204, or the entire handle and elongate body assembly may be decoupled from the electrical and fluid connections 206, 208. In yet another embodiment, the handle, elongate body, and connections may be removably coupled to a housing that contains, for example, the fluid reservoir, degassing apparatus, pump, and power supply and controller shown in FIG. 1. Further, the degassing apparatuses described herein may also be disassembled partially or completely. In particular, a degassing apparatus similar to the apparatus 310 can be disconnected from a fluid enhanced ablation system and cleaned or otherwise sterilized by, for example, passing a cleaning fluid through the apparatus. Still further, in some embodiments, the apparatus can be configured to disassemble such that individual components, such as each tube 330, can be removed and cleaned individually, or replaced. Preferably, the devices described herein will be processed before surgery. First, a new or used instrument can be obtained and, if necessary, cleaned. The instrument can then be sterilized. In one sterilization technique, the instrument is placed in a closed and sealed container, such as a plastic or TYVEK bag. The container and its contents can then be placed in a field of radiation that can penetrate the container, such as gamma radiation, x-rays, or high-energy electrons. The radiation can kill bacteria on the instrument and in the container. The sterilized instrument can then be stored in the sterile container. The sealed container can keep the instrument sterile until it is opened in the medical facility. In many embodiments, it is preferred that the device is sterilized. This can be done by any number of ways known to those skilled in the art including beta or gamma radiation, ethylene oxide, steam, and a liquid bath (e.g., cold soak). In certain embodiments, the materials selected for use in forming components such as the elongate body may not be able to withstand certain forms of sterilization, such as gamma radiation. In such a case, suitable alternative forms of sterilization can be used, such as ethylene oxide. One skilled in the art will appreciate further features and advantages of the invention based on the above-described embodiments.

A method for ablating tissue, comprising: inserting an elongate body into a tissue mass;delivering through an inner lumen of the elongate body fluid that is at least partially degassed such that the fluid contains one or more gases having less than a predetermined partial pressure;delivering energy to at least one heating assembly disposed within the inner lumen to heat the at least partially degassed fluid flowing through the lumen prior to the at least partially degassed fluid flowing into the tissue mass through at least one outlet port in the elongate body; anddelivering energy to an ablation element, while simultaneously delivering energy to the at least one heating assembly, to ablate the tissue mass. 15. The method of claim 14, further comprising, prior to delivering the at least partially degassed fluid through the inner lumen, activating a pump to deliver fluid through a mass exchanger that at least partially degasses the fluid, the at least partially degassed fluid flowing from the mass exchanger into the inner lumen of the elongate body. 16. The method of claim 14, wherein delivering the at least partially degassed fluid through the inner lumen comprises activating a pump to force the at least partially degassed fluid from a reservoir into the inner lumen. 17. The method of claim 14, wherein the fluid consists essentially of normal saline solution. 18. The method of claim 14, wherein the fluid consists essentially of concentrated saline solution. 19. The method of claim 14, wherein the fluid consists essentially of Ringer's solution. 20. The method of claim 14, further comprising, prior to delivering at least partially degassed fluid through the inner lumen of the elongate body, determining an amount of a gas in the at least partially degassed fluid with a sensor. 21. The method of claim 14, wherein inserting the elongate body into the tissue mass includes passing a tissue-puncturing distal tip of the elongate body into the tissue mass.
