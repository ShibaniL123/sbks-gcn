CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Priorities are claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-280345 filed on Dec. 22, 2012, the content of which are incorporated herein by reference. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Disclosed is a low platinum content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder that has a platinum metal content ≦3.5 ppm by mass relative to the silicone rubber powder mass. Also disclosed is a cosmetic raw material- and cosmetic composition-related applications of the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder. Also disclosed is a process to produce the silicone rubber powder, post treatment processing of a silicone rubber powder, with the object of lowering the platinum metal content of the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder. Silicone rubber powders can be used by blending in cosmetic compositions for improving the feel of use of the cosmetic compositions. Silicone rubber powders are widely used as raw materials for cosmetic compositions, external use preparations, and quasi-drugs, whether the system is oily or aqueous. In particular, hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powders using a hydrosilylation reaction catalyst including a platinum type metal are widely used as silicone rubber powders due to rapid curing, easy control of the reaction, and the ability to select various types of curing conditions. Production methods for a hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder are exemplified by a method of curing a hydrosilylation-reaction crosslinkable liquid silicone rubber composition by curing while the hydrosilylation-reaction crosslinkable liquid silicone rubber composition is sprayed in hot air (see Japanese Unexamined Patent. Application Publication No. S59-068333A); and methods that cure a liquid silicone rubber composition while the liquid silicone rubber composition is dispersed in water using a surfactant, and then remove the water (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. S62-243621A, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. S63-077942A, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. S64-070558A). Here, the method of curing a liquid silicone rubber composition while dispersed in water is typical due to the ability to prepare uniform spherical silicone rubber powder with good efficiency. However, in the known production methods, the platinum hydrosilylation reaction catalyst is incorporated in the surface or interior of the silicone rubber powder due to crosslinking, and thus remains in the silicone rubber powder product. The platinum metal in the silicone rubber powder reacts with other cosmetic raw materials, causes changes of properties or odorization, and may cause discoloration by forming platinum black or metal complexes. It is thus desirable to lower the platinum metal content in the silicone rubber powder as much as possible, and more specifically to a level ≦3.5 ppm by mass of the total silicone rubber powder. However, the platinum metal included in the hydrosilylation reaction catalyst is incorporated in the crosslinked structure of the silicone rubber, and it is not possible to remove the platinum metal by a normal washing process targeting the removal of a foreign object. Additionally known treatment processes using organic solvents have had a problem of the inability to sufficiently reduce the platinum metal content in the silicone rubber powder. Furthermore, when utilizing the method of treatment using an organic solvent, problems occur such as a great increase of environmental burden, remaining of strongly irritating organic solvent in the obtained silicone rubber powder, odorization due to the solvent, or the like. Thus, the method of treatment using an organic solvent sometimes may not be used with the object of obtaining a cosmetic composition composed of a low platinum content silicone rubber powder. On the other hand, the aforementioned known references, such as Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. S64-070558A and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2010-132878A, mention that a platinum metal content of about 1 to 100 ppm may be used for the curing reaction. However, the time of production is excessively prolonged when using <5 ppm by mass for the hydrosilylation reaction, and generally a platinum metal content of about 5 to 20 ppm by mass is adopted for economics in an actual silicone rubber powder industrial production process (see the practical examples in the various references). If reaction conditions were to be adopted at an industrial scale resulting in a platinum content below this level, due to the increase in cycle time, production would become difficult from the standpoint of economics. For this reason, not only is there no specific disclosure in the aforementioned known references of a hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder having a platinum metal content ≦3.5 ppm by mass, according to disclosure of the aforementioned known references, there has been a problem in that a low platinum content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder can not be obtained in an actual industrial production process. Furthermore, these known references disclose manufacturing methods for silicone rubber that use a platinum metal-containing hydrosilylation reaction catalyst for curing a liquid silicone rubber composition while the silicone rubber composition is dispersed in water using a surfactant, and thereafter removing the water. However, there is neither mention nor suggestion of washing the obtained silicone rubber powder using an aqueous solution of a nonionic type surfactant. Moreover, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2010-132877A and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2010-132878A, when adding platinum metal-type catalyst to an emulsion of the liquid silicone rubber composition prior to curing, if the dispersibility of the platinum metal-type catalyst in water is poor, there is a mention of adding the platinum metal-type catalyst as an emulsion in a state produced by dissolving in a surfactant (e.g. paragraph 0045 of Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2010-132878A). However, there is neither mention nor suggestions of washing the obtained silicone rubber powder using an aqueous solution of a nonionic type surfactant. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a low platinum content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder capable of being produced using a simple process suitable for use in industrial production, and that does not adversely affect other cosmetic raw materials and does not cause problems of odorization and discoloration. Similarly, objects of the present invention are to provide an cosmetic application and a suitable production method of the low platinum content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder. The inventors of the present invention discovered the ability to extremely effectively lower platinum metal content in hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder by washing crosslinkable silicone rubber powder obtained by hydrosilylation reaction using an aqueous solution of at least one type of surfactant, and more alternatively an aqueous solution including polyoxyethylene alkyl ether or sodium diethylhexyl sulfosuccinate, heated to a temperature of 30° C. to 99° C. The hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder of the present invention has a platinum metal content ≦3.5 ppm by mass. In the range of cycle time and at the scale capable of use for industrial production, unwashed silicone rubber powder obtained by hydrosilylation reaction contains at least 5.0 ppm by mass of platinum. However, the present invention is able to realize a reduction in platinum metal content by washing the obtained silicone rubber powder using an aqueous solution of at least one type of surfactant described below. Although platinum metal content in the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder of the present invention is in the range of 0.0 to 3.5 ppm by mass, using a cycle time and scale capable of use for industrial production, the platinum metal content in the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder is typically in the range of 1.5 to 3.0 ppm by mass, alternatively in the range of 1.6 to 2.9 ppm by mass. Furthermore, if washing by the aqueous solution of surfactant is repeated over a long time interval, it is possible to lower the platinum metal content to from 0.0 to 0.5 ppm by mass. However, in practice, when the platinum metal content is ≦3.5 ppm by mass (alternatively ≦3.0 ppm by mass, alternatively ≦2.6 ppm by mass), the object of the invention may be attained in that there is no adverse effect of the platinum in the silicone rubber powder on other cosmetic raw materials, and there is no occurrence of odorization and discoloration. Although no particular limitation is placed on the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder of the present invention, an average particle diameter thereof is typically from 0.1 μm to 10 mm, alternatively is from 0.1 μm to 1 mm, alternatively is from 0.1 μm to 500 μm. A particle shape of this silicone rubber powder is exemplified by spherical, regular spherical, ellipsoidal, and irregularly shaped. Spherical and regular spherical shapes are typical. Moreover, from the standpoint of use as a cosmetic raw material, the silicone rubber powder typically is non-tacky, and when the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber composition is cured to form a sheet-like cured product, the rubber hardness measured by a JIS A hardness meter as specified in JIS K 6301 is alternatively in the range of 5 to 99, and further alternatively is in the range of 20 to 70. In particular, when rubber hardness is within the aforementioned range, agglomeration of the obtained silicone rubber powder is sufficiently suppressed, and the obtained silicone rubber powder readily has good fluidity and dispersibility, and has excellent clean, smooth, and soft feel. No particular limitation is placed on the method of preparing the unwashed silicone rubber powder. The unwashed silicone rubber powder may be produced by methods exemplified by: a method of obtaining a silicone cured product by curing a hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber composition comprising (A) an organopolysiloxane having at least two alkenyl groups in a molecule, (B) an organohydrogenpolysiloxane having at least two silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in a molecule, and (C) a platinum-based catalyst, and using a pulverizing apparatus such as a grinder or the like to pulverize the silicone cured product; a method of curing the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber composition by spraying the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber composition in hot air using a spraying apparatus such as a spray dryer or the like; and a method of dispersing the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber composition in a surfactant aqueous solution and curing the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber composition. Due to the ability to form a uniform spherical silicone rubber powder, the typical method cures the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber composition while the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber composition is dispersed in water using a surfactant, and then removes the water. The platinum-based catalyst (C) is exemplified by platinum fine powder, chloroplatinic acid, an alcohol solution of chloroplatinic acid, a platinum-alkenylsiloxane complex, a platinum-olefin complex, a platinum-carbonyl complex, platinum black, and platinum supported on silica, or the like. The catalyst (C) is alternatively a platinum-alkenylsiloxane complex. From the standpoint of an industrial production process, the utilized amount of the platinum-based catalyst is an amount such that the platinum metal content becomes at least 5.0 ppm by mass, alternatively in the range of 5 to 100 ppm by mass, alternatively in the range of 5 to 20 ppm by mass, relative to the mass of the cured product resulting from crosslinking of the components (A) and (B). When the amount of the platinum metal in the (C) is less than the lower limit, it becomes difficult to realize production from the standpoint of economics due to the increase in cycle time. On the other hand, when the amount of the platinum metal exceeds the upper limit, a large amount of platinum metal may remain in the silicone rubber powder, and this would impede the object of the present invention, i.e. to provide a low platinum content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder. The alkenyl group of the organopolysiloxane (A) having at least two alkenyl groups in a molecule is exemplified by vinyl groups, allyl groups, butenyl groups, pentenyl groups, and hexenyl groups; and vinyl groups and hexenyl groups are preferred. The non-alkenyl groups bonded to the silicon atom are exemplified by substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon groups as exemplified by alkyl groups such as methyl groups, ethyl groups, propyl groups, butyl groups, and the like; cycloalkyl groups such as cyclopentyl groups, cyclohexyl groups, and the like; aryl groups such as phenyl groups, tolyl groups, xylyl groups and the like; aralkyl groups such as benzyl groups, phenethyl groups, 3-phenylpropyl groups, and the like; halogenated alkyl groups such as 3-chloropropyl groups, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl groups, and the like; or the like. A molecular structure of the organopolysiloxane (A) having at least two alkenyl groups in a molecule is exemplified by straight, cyclic, net-like, and partially branched straight structures. The straight and partially branched straight structures are particularly preferred. A viscosity of the organopolysiloxane (A) having at least two alkenyl groups in a molecule is alternatively a viscosity capable of allowing dispersion of the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone composition in water. Specifically, the viscosity of the organopolysiloxane (A) having at least two alkenyl groups in a molecule at 25° C. is alternatively in the range of 20 to 100,000 mPa·s, and further alternatively is in the range of 20 to 10,000 mPa·s. Furthermore, from the standpoint of improvement of oil absorptivity of the obtained hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder, the organopolysiloxane of the component (A) alternatively has a dimethylsiloxane unit (represented by the formula: —(CH3)2SiO—) content that is at least 90 mol % of the total siloxane units other than the molecular terminal siloxane units. In the same manner, from the standpoint of improving oil absorptivity of the obtained hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder, cyclic or chain organopolysiloxanes of a low degree of polymerization (i.e. degree of polymerization=3 to 20) are alternatively removed in advance by stripping or the like. The non-hydrogen groups bonded to the silicon atoms in the organohydrogenpolysiloxane (B) having at least two silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in a molecule are exemplified by the substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon groups cited above. The organohydrogenpolysiloxane (B) having at least two silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in a molecule may have a straight, cyclic, net-like, or a partially branched straight chain molecular structure. Moreover, the viscosity is alternatively a viscosity such that the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone composition may be dispersed in water. Specifically, the viscosity at 25° C. is alternatively in the range of 1 to 10,000 mP·s. No particular limitation is placed on the contents of components (A) and (B) as long as these contents allow curing of the composition by addition reaction. However, these contents alternatively result in the number of alkenyl groups in the component (A) relative to a single silicon-bonded hydrogen atom in the component (B) becoming 0.5 to 4.0, and further alternatively becoming 0.5 to 2.0. Moreover, the content of the component (B) is alternatively in the range of 0.3 to 500 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the organopolysiloxane having the alkenyl groups. By emulsification and curing of the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber composition in the surfactant aqueous solution, it is possible to readily adjust the particle diameter of the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder. This surfactant is exemplified by nonionic type surfactants, anion type surfactants, cation type surfactants, and betaine type surfactants. The particle diameter of the obtained cured silicone particles will differ according to the type and content of the surfactant. In order to prepare cured silicone particles of a small particle diameter, the added amount of this surfactant per 100 parts by mass of the crosslinkable silicone rubber composition is alternatively in the range of 0.5 to 50 parts by mass. Conversely, in order to prepare cured silicone rubber powder of a large particle diameter, the added amount of this surfactant per 100 parts by mass of the crosslinkable silicone rubber composition is typically in the range of 0.1 to 10 parts by mass. Furthermore, the added amount of water as a dispersing medium per 100 parts by mass of the crosslinkable silicone rubber composition is in the range of 20 to 1,500 parts by mass, alternatively 50 to 1,000 parts by mass. These surfactants may be blended without modification in the cosmetic composition, and the silicone rubber powder of the present invention may be used as a cosmetic raw material. Emulsification equipment is alternatively used for uniform dispersion of the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber composition in water. This emulsification equipment is exemplified by a homomixer, a paddle mixer, a Henschel mixer, a homo-disper, a colloid mill, a propeller stirrer, a homogenizer, an in-line continuous emulsifier, an ultrasonic emulsifier, or a vacuum kneader. Thereafter, the aqueous type dispersion of the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber composition prepared by the aforementioned method may be heated or left at room temperature to allow curing of the crosslinkable silicone rubber composition in this aqueous dispersion, and an aqueous dispersion of silicone rubber powder may be prepared. If the aqueous dispersion of the crosslinkable silicone rubber composition is heated, the heating temperature is typically ≦100° C., alternatively is from 10 to 95° C. Moreover, the method for heating the aqueous dispersion of the crosslinkable silicone rubber composition is exemplified by a method of directly heating this aqueous dispersion, and a method of adding this aqueous dispersion to hot water. Thereafter, the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder may be prepared by removal of water from aqueous dispersion of the silicone rubber powder. Methods for removal of water from the aqueous dispersion of the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder are exemplified by drying methods using a vacuum dryer, circulating hot air oven, or spray dryer. Even if a nonionic type surfactant is used as the surfactant, the aforementioned moisture removal process of the aforementioned method differs from a washing process in that the platinum metal content in the silicone rubber powder is not reduced. Although part of the platinum-containing hydrosilylation reaction catalyst that was not incorporated in the crosslinked system of the silicone rubber powder is thought to be present in the aqueous phase in the form of an aqueous dispersion, at the time of removal of water by drying, it is hypothesized that the platinum-containing hydrosilylation reaction catalyst is incorporated on the surface or in the interior of the silicone rubber powder. The platinum metal content in the silicone rubber powder is not reduced by the method of using a pulverizer such as a grinder or the like for pulverization of the silicone rubber cured product obtained by curing the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber composition. The platinum metal content in the silicone rubber powder is also not reduced by the method of spraying and curing the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber composition in hot air using a spraying apparatus such as a spray dryer or the like. The present invention is characterized by reducing the platinum content of the silicone rubber powder obtained by the aforementioned method by washing the silicone rubber powder using an aqueous solution of at least one type of surfactant. No particular limitation is placed on the washing process using an aqueous solution of a nonionic type surfactant, as long as this process includes a step of contacting the aqueous solution of surfactant with high platinum content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder, and, thereafter, a step of separation (i.e. drainage or the like) of the aqueous solution of surfactant from the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder having lowered platinum content. As long as the washing process is performed at least once, it is also possible to perform the washing process multiple times to reach a desired platinum metal content. For example, the aqueous solution of surfactant and the high platinum content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder are placed in a batch type vessel equipped with an agitator device or the like, and the silicone rubber powder is water washed by immersing in the aqueous phase or by stirring in the aqueous phase for a desired time interval. Thereafter, the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder having lowered platinum content may be separated out by filtration. In the same manner, the high platinum content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder may be placed on a filtration device such as a mesh or the like, washing may be performed by circulating the aqueous solution of surfactant through the silicone rubber powder layer once or multiple times, and the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder having lowered platinum content may be separated out. The aforementioned washing process using the aqueous solution of surfactant is able to be performed as a process independent from the production of the high platinum content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder, and the washing process using the aqueous solution of surfactant is alternatively performed as a process independent from the production of the high platinum content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder. The method of producing the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder according to the invention of the present application is advantageous due to the ability to be performed quite simply using known equipment as a method for reducing platinum metal content of any silicone rubber powder. For example, a high platinum content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder produced by a third party may be used to make a reduced platinum metal content silicone rubber powder by use of an aqueous solution of surfactant for washing such high platinum content silicone rubber powder, using desired equipment or apparatus of the party who has purchased the high platinum content silicone rubber powder. A practical benefit is that even a party who does not self-produce the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder may be able to use commercial high platinum content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder to easily produce a low platinum content silicone rubber powder. The washing process using the aqueous solution of surfactant is typically performed using an aqueous solution containing surfactant heated to a temperature of 30° C. to 99° C. By the use of a heated aqueous solution, it is possible to increase the concentration of surfactant, it is possible to prevent precipitation of the surfactant on the silicone rubber powder, and it is possible to efficiently lower the platinum metal content in the hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder. In particular, the washing alternatively uses an aqueous solution heated to from 35° C. to 99° C., alternatively 40° C. to 99° C., alternatively 40° C. to 60° C. Furthermore, if the high platinum content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder and aqueous solution of surfactant are placed in a batch type vessel equipped with a stirring device or the like, and if the silicone rubber powder is washed by stirring or immersing in the aqueous phase for a desired time interval, the vessel itself is particularly alternatively provided with a heater or a constant temperature device so that washings may be performed successively in the aforementioned temperature range. Moreover, although no particular limitation is placed on the step of separation to remove the aqueous solution by drainage or the like after the washing, this is alternatively performed by drainage of the aqueous solution after washing by subjecting the silicone rubber powder to centrifugal separation or the like. No particular limitation is placed on the concentration of the surfactant in the aqueous solution of the surfactant as long as the platinum metal content can be reduced. However, this concentration is typically in the range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, alternatively at least 0.3% by mass, alternatively 0.50 to 5.0% by mass. The surfactant may be at least one type selected from the group consisting of anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, and amphoteric surfactants. In particular, the use of a nonionic surfactant or an anionic surfactant is preferred. From the standpoint of efficient reduction in the platinum metal content, the use of an α-sulfofatty acid ester salt such as sodium diethylhexyl sulfosuccinate or the like or a polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether having an HLB value of 7.0 to 16.5 is particularly preferred, although the surfactant is not limited to these examples. Examples of anionic surfactants include saturated or unsaturated fatty acid salts (e.g. sodium laurate, sodium stearate, sodium oleate, sodium linolenate, and the like); alkylsulfuric acid salts; alkylbenzene sulfonic acids (e.g. hexylbenzenesulfonic acid, octylbenzenesulfonic acid, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, and the like) and salts thereof; polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether sulfuric acid salts; polyoxyalkylene alkenyl ether sulfuric acid salts; polyoxyethylene alkylsulfuric ester salts; sulfosuccinic acid alkyl ester salts; polyoxyalkylene sulfosuccinic acid alkyl ester salts; polyoxyalkylene alkylphenyl ether sulfuric acid salts; alkanesulfonic acid salts; octyltrimethylammonium hydroxide; dodecyltrimethylammonium hydroxide; alkyl sulfonates; polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ether sulfuric acid salts; polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether acetic acid salts; alkyl phosphoric acid salts; polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether phosphoric acid salts; acylglutamic acid salts; α-acylsulfonic acid salts; alkylsulfonic acid salts; alkylallylsulfonic acid salts; α-olefinsulfonic acid salts; alkylnaphthalene sulfonic acid salts; alkanesulfonic acid salts; alkyl or alkenylsulfuric acid salts; alkylamide sulfuric acid salts; alkyl- or alkenyl phosphoric acid salts; alkylamide phosphoric acid salts; alkyloylalkyl taurine salts; N-acylamino acid salts; sulfosuccinic acid salts; alkyl ether carboxylic acid salts; amide ether carboxylic acid salts; α-sulfofatty acid ester salts; alanine derivatives; glycine derivatives; and arginine derivatives.

The low platinum metal content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder obtained by the present invention has greatly lowered discoloration. It is relatively easy to obtain low platinum metal content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder that has a b* value ≦−0.70 as measured by the L* a* b* color coordinate system specified by JIS Z 8729. Alternatively, the b* value of the low platinum metal content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder obtained by the present invention is in the range of −0.70 to −0.90. The low platinum metal content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder obtained by the present invention may be a composite cured silicone powder produced by coating using an inorganic fine powder and a lipophilic oily agent. The low platinum metal content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder obtained by the present invention may be used to make an aqueous suspension by dispersion in water using the surfactant and an aqueous solvent density adjustment agent such as a desired polyhydric alcohol or the like. In the same manner, the low platinum metal content hydrosilylation reaction-crosslinkable silicone rubber powder obtained by the present invention may be used in the form of a cosmetic product premix by forming an aqueous suspension with another cosmetic raw material component such as a pigment or the like.

Measurement of Platinum Metal Content The value of platinum metal content in the silicone rubber powder was measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS; model: Agilent 7500a; manufactured by Yokogawa Analytical Systems, Inc.). Measurement of Coloration The degree of coloration of each of the silicone rubber powders was measured using a Color-guide 45°/0° colorimeter (manufactured by Gardner) using the measured b* (yellow color) value. Reference Example 1 77.0 parts by mass of a dimethylvinylpolysiloxane represented by the average formula: [in-line-formulae]CH2—CH(CH3)2SiO[(CH3)2SiO]130[(CH3)(CH2═CH)SiO]2Si(CH3)2CH═CH2 [/in-line-formulae] 21.5 parts by mass of a dimethylmethylhydrogenpolysiloxane capped at both molecular terminals with trimethylsiloxy groups represented by the average formula: [in-line-formulae](CH3)3SiO[(CH3)2SiO]51.3[(CH3)HSiO]6.3Si(CH3)3 [/in-line-formulae] and an isopropyl alcohol solution of chloroplatinic acid (at an amount of 50 ppm in terms of mass units the content of the platinum metal of the present composition) were stirred uniformly at 5° C. to prepare an addition reaction curable silicone composition. Thereafter, this composition was dispersed in an aqueous solution at 25° C. that was composed of 50 parts by mass of purified water and 1.5 parts by mass of polyoxyethylene isocetyl ether. After this mixture was made further uniformly emulsified using a colloid mill, 50 parts by mass of purified water was added for dilution to prepare the emulsion. Thereafter, this emulsion was heated and cured to prepare a uniform aqueous suspension of silicone rubber particles. Thereafter, the suspension was dried in a hot air circulating oven at 150° C. to prepare the silicone rubber powder. Particles of this silicone rubber powder were spherical. The average particle diameter was 6.2 μm, and the JIS A hardness was 60. Moreover, the coloration of the silicone rubber powder was −0.28 (b*), and the platinum metal (Pt) content was 7.2 ppm by mass. Practical Example 1 300 parts by mass of water, 1.5 parts by mass of SANNONIC SS-120 (polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, HLB 14.5, produced by Sanyo Chemical Industries, Inc.), and 1.5 parts by mass of SANNONIC SS-30 (polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, HLB 8.0, produced by Sanyo Chemical Industries, Inc.) were added to 100 parts by mass of the silicone rubber powder obtained in Reference Example 1. This mixture was stirred and heated to 98° C. for 1 hour, and then was filtered. Then, 170 parts by mass of water was added to the residue, and the mixture was filtered again. The residue was then dried overnight in an oven at 40° C. to obtain silicone rubber powder. The coloration of the obtained silicone rubber powder was −0.82 (b*), and the platinum metal (Pt) content was 2.5 ppm by mass. Practical Example 2 A silicone rubber powder was obtained in the same manner as in Practical Example 1, except for addition of 3 parts by mass of NIKKOL OT P-75 (sodium di(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate liquid; manufactured by Nikko Chemicals Co., Ltd.) rather than the SANNONIC SS-120 and SANNONIC SS-30.

Practical Example 3 300 parts by mass of water, 1.5 parts by mass of SANNONIC SS-120 (polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, HLB 14.5, produced by Sanyo Chemical Industries, Inc.), and 1.5 parts by mass of SANNONIC SS-30 (polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, HLB 8.0, produced by Sanyo Chemical Industries, Inc.) were added to 100 parts by mass of the silicone rubber powder obtained in Reference Example 1. This mixture was stirred and heated to 50° C. for 1 hour, and then was filtered. Then, 170 parts by mass of water was added to the residue, and the mixture was filtered again. The residue was then dried overnight in an oven at 40° C. to obtain silicone rubber powder. The coloration of the obtained silicone rubber powder was −0.89 (b*), and the platinum metal (Pt) content was 1.8 ppm by mass. Comparative Example 1 300 parts by mass of water was added to 100 parts by mass of the silicone rubber powder obtained in Reference Example 1.

Comparative Example 2 200 parts by mass of toluene and 100 parts by weight of IPA were added to 100 parts by mass of the silicone rubber powder obtained in Reference Example 1, and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour. Then, after the mixture was allowed to stand overnight, the mixture was filtered. Then, 20 parts by mass of toluene was added to the residue, and the mixture was filtered again. The residue was then dried overnight in an oven at 40° C. to obtain silicone rubber powder. The coloration of the obtained silicone rubber powder was −0.69 (b*), and the platinum metal (Pt) content was 3.6 ppm by mass. Moreover, the obtained silicone rubber powder had an odor of toluene and IPA.
