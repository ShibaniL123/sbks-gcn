ΐ AUSTRALIA Patents Act 1990 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION FOR THE INVENTION ENTITLED: Vegetation cutting apparatus Applicant: Darren Carter The invention is described in the following statement: Vegetation cutting apparatus Field of the invention This invention relates to cutting heads for fitting to hand-guided edge trimmers that are configured to be carried by an operator during use. The invention also relates to edge trimmers having such cutting heads. Background of the invention A variety of motorised vegetation trimming devices are available for trimming grass or other vegetation along edges of a lawn and around trees. Such devices are known by a variety of names, but may generally be referred to as edge trimmers. A drawing of an exemplary edge trimmer is shown in figure 1. The edge trimmer 10 has a body 11 with an elongated neck 12, at a distal end of which is mounted a cutting head 13. The cutting head spins about a drive shaft 14 at the distal end of the elongated neck, the drive shaft being rotationally driven in a direction 15 by a motor 16. The motor may be, as exemplified in Figure 1, a petrol-powered combustion motor, usually a 2-stroke motor. More recently, 4-stroke motors have become common. The motor is fed petrol from petrol tank 17 adjacent the motor 16. The motor is controlled by throttle 21 at handle 18a. The drive shaft 14 is, in this embodiment, more precisely comprised of on an upper drive shaft, which is in direct communication with the motor 16 and passes internally along the elongated neck 12, and a lower shaft which protrudes from the neck to drive the cutting head 13. As an alternative to having a petrol-powered motor, some edge trimmers are driven by an electric motor located at the distal end of the neck. The body also comprises a support handle 18b for holding and guiding the edge trimmer, and a safety guide 19 to protect a user from vegetation debris thrown by the cutting head. Some edge trimmers are better suited than others to a given application. The suitability depends, inter alia, on the type of vegetation being cut, the degree of industrial use, and the level of required safety. One common type of edge trimmer for cutting grass and light weeds, is a line trimmer, which is the type of edge trimmer shown in figure 1. Line trimmers are also known as a whipper snippers, string trimmers, strimmers, weed whackers, weed whips and weed eaters. In the line trimmer 10, the cutting head 13 has two diametrically opposed cutting strings 20 extending radially from a spool in hub 22. The hub 22 is mounted on the drive shaft 14, which when driven by the motor 16, spins in direction 15. The strings provide a cutting force just sufficient to cut light grass and light weeds, so pose a minimal safety hazard if the user accidentally contacts the spinning strings against one of their feet. However, the low cutting force also prevents the line trimmers from cutting thicker, tougher vegetation, such as saplings. The string ends wear down with use, requiring restoration by feeding more string from the spool. However, the string ends can wear down to such an extent that they become trapped within the hub, requiring manual intervention to pull them free. This can be frustrating and inconvenient to operators, who may therefore find such string-based cutting heads poorly suited to use on an industrial scale. For trimming edges on a more industrial scale, or where there is a need to cut tougher vegetation, the string-based cutting heads can be interchanged with bladed cutting heads. Alternatively, a higher powered edge trimmer, known as a brush cutter, may be used. In addition to being higher power, brush cutters employ thicker strings or bladed heads. However, there are problems associated with bladed heads. The blades pose a safety hazard to users because the blades cut with enough force to severely injure a person if one of their feet contacts a blade when the trimmer is in use. This is particularly so for metal blades, due to (a) the hard nature of metal and (b) a relatively high moment of inertia which results from their heavy mass. Plastic blades, on the other hand, are softer and lighter, but wear down quickly. This causes damage or loss to any serrations on the blade’s cutting edge, reducing its cutting effectiveness. Another problem with bladed cutting heads is that, if they are used to cut grass, the higher cutting force throws debris a relatively long distance from the edge trimmer, posing a safety risk to passers by. Therefore such devices are potentially unsuitable for cutting grass in public areas, such as nature strips. Also, if the blades contact objects, such as trees or fences, which are too tough too be cut by the blades, the impact of the blade against the object can result in a kickback force to user, making it difficult to maintain control over the edge trimmer. Accordingly, there is a need for an alternative cutting apparatus which ameliorates at least one of the problems associated with the prior art, or provides a useful alternative that is adapted for its target application.

Detailed description of the embodiments An exemplary embodiment of an edge trimmer in accordance with the present invention is now described. Edge trimmer 30, as shown in Figure 1Α, is the same as line trimmer 10 that was described with reference to Figure 1, except that edge trimmer 30 has a blade-based cutting head 32, embodying the invention, instead of the string-based cutting head 13. The cutting head 32 (Figure 2) is comprised of a frame 34 and three blades 36 pivotably mounted to the frame 34 at respective locations 38 equiangularly spaced along an outer portion 40 of the frame. The frame further comprises a hub 42 having an aperture 44 for mounting the frame on the drive shaft of the edge trimmer 30. The centre of the aperture 44 therefore defines a spin axis 45 (perpendicular to the page, in Figure 2) about which the frame spins when driven by the drive shaft. The outer portion 40 is generally ring-shaped such that the outer portion defines an outer perimeter 46 of the frame, which is smooth and circular, and has an internal edge 48 that defines an open centre 50. The outer portion 40 is joined to the hub 42 by three spokes 52 that extend radially from the hub 42 to the outer portion 40. The frame is open between adjacent spokes, which has the advantage of reducing the weight and material cost of the frame. The outer portion 40, is comprised of two identical aluminium ring components 40Α, 40Β (Figure 2Α). The spokes 52 and hub 42 make up an inner assembly 43 comprised of two back-to-back sheets 43 A, 43Β, having the same profile, but different thickness. The thinner of the sheets 43Α is comprised of aluminium to provide strength, while the thicker sheet 43Β is comprised of nylon, or other relatively light, but dimensionally stable, material. An opening 53 is provided through each of spokes 52 to reduce the weight of the spokes. The distal end 47 of each spoke is fastened with a screw 49Α and nut 49Β, or by a rivet (not shown) or other fastening means, between the two ring components 40Α, 40Β of the outer portion 40. The combined thickness of the two sheets 43 A, 43Β therefore sets a separation gap 51 between the two ring components 40A, 40Β such that blades 36, which are pivotably mounted at locations 38 between the two rings 40Α, 40Β, are free to move about their pivot axis, but are restrained from moving along their pivot axis. The pivotal mounting of each blade is by a fastener 41, such as a screw or rivet, which passes through the two ring components 40a and 40b, at location 38, and through a hole (not shown) in the blade 36. The hole is larger than the diameter of the fastener so that the blade is free to pivot about the shaft of the fastener. The pivotal mounting of the blades is such that when the frame spins in the direction 15 (clockwise in Figure 2) about the spin axis 45, a centripetal force pivots the blades 36 to an extended position, as shown Figure 2, in which a cutting portion 54 of each blade protrudes from a base 68, which is aligned with the perimeter 46 of the frame 34, to an opposed distal tip 66. The cutting position of each blade is determined by respective extension stops 56 integrally formed on each spoke 52. Each extension stop 56 is a surface on a first side 58 of the spoke, the surface having a complementary shape to the a mating portion 60 of blade 36 so that the force of the blade hitting the stop is evenly distributed onto the respective mating portion of the blade, so as to minimise wear and tear on the blade. The cutting portion 54 of the blade 36 has a cutting edge 62 (Figure 3) and an opposed rear edge 64. The cutting edge 62 is shaped to be circumscribed by a notional convex cutting envelope 71. The notional convex cutting envelope 71 has substantially the same curvature the perimeter 46 of the frame. The rear edge 64 is also convex in shape, and also with substantially the same curvature at the perimeter 46. The cutting envelope 71 and the rear edge 64 taper from the base 68 to the distal tip 66 of the cutting portion. The notional convex cutting envelope 71 at position 70 at the base 68 of the cutting portion is generally parallel with a notional radial line 73 that passes from the axis 45 to and the position 70. While the embodiment in the figures shows the positioning means as being a series of stops 56, the position means may, in other embodiments, be intrinsic in the shape of the blade and configuration of the pivotal mounting to the frame. In such other embodiments (not shown), the extended position is determined by the balance of the blade about the pivotal mounting when experiencing the centripetal force. When the blades encounter an obstruction, such as a tree, fence, or a person’s foot, the blades pivot towards a retracted position (Figure 4) in which the blades 36 are wholly within the perimeter 46 of the frame. The pivoting reduces kick-back felt by the operator of the edge trimmer. Additionally, by virtue of the blade withdrawing within the frame perimeter 46, the operator is relatively protected from the cutting edge and serrations therein should the blades contact one of their feet. The potential danger and kick-back effect posed by having a blade is also counteracted by having the blades constructed from nylon, as opposed to metal which the inventor believes improves the strength of the blade. The nylon is nylon 6, and is formed by extrusion, rather than moulding, as the inventor believes forming the blade by extrusion results in a stronger blade. The retracted position is defined by a retraction stop 74 on a second side 76 of a corresponding spoke 52. The retraction stop is shaped to be complementary in shape to the portion 78 of the rear edge 64 of the blade against which it abuts in the retracted position. With reference in particular to Figure 3, to assist in the blade’s cutting effectiveness, the cutting edge 62 includes serrations in the form of three V-shaped notches 80, each notch being defined by a respective first edge 82 and second edge 84 that recede from the notional convex cutting envelope 71. The first edge 82 and the second edge 84 of each notch are generally straight edges, which meet at an apex 88. The front edge 82 is angled in the blade such that when a blade is in the extended position, the front edge is generally perpendicular to a notional radial line 90 between axis 45 and the apex 88. As the blade passes from the extended position to the retracted position, there exists an orientation at which the apex 88 of the notch 80 aligns with the perimeter 46 of the frame (Figure 5). At this orientation, the second edge 84 is between the distal tip 66 of the blade and a notional radial line 92 from the axis 45 through the notch 88. This orientation of the second edge allows cut vegetation to be ejected from the notch and thereby allows the blade to pass into the frame without jamming. The blades are pivoted at a location on the blade such that when the blade is in the extended position (Figure 2), between 25 and 40 percent of the blade’s mass is between the aperture of the frame and the location of the pivot. Another embodiment of a cutting head 132 in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in Figures 6-6b. Cutting head 132 is similar to the cutting head 32 except that the ring components 140Α, 140Β of frame 134 are comprised of respective sheets or moldings of nylon 6,6. Inner assembly 143 is a single sheet or molding of nylon 6,6. The cutting head 132 is assembled by heat sealing the components together. In this case, there is no need for screw 49A and nut 49Β nor is there need for a rivet. Likewise, instead of using a fastener 41 to provide a shaft for the blade 136 to pivot about, the shaft is provided by a nylon standoff which is heat sealed to each of the outer ring components 140A, 140Β. The three spokes 145 (a,b,c) have an open, web-like structure. Like spokes 52, each of the spokes 145(a,b,c) has corresponding retractions stops 146 (a,b,c) and extension stops 147(a,b,c) on either side of the spoke. A given extension stop, such as stop 147a, may be formed by an extension from any one, two or all three of spoke 145a, hub 148 or an adjacent spoke 145c. In this embodiment, the blades 136 are formed by molding Kevlar® reinforced nylon 6,6. This material results in a blade that is particularly strong, despite being formed by molding. Thus, in this case, there is no need to form the blade by extrusion. Each blade 136 is pivoted at a location on the blade such that when the blade is in the extended position (Figures 6 and 6A), between 15 and 35 percent of the blade’s mass is between the aperture 144 of the frame and the centre of the blade’s mounting pivot location 138. More precisely about 20-25% of the blade’s mass is between the central aperture 144 of the frame and the pivot location 138, while the remaining 75-80% is between the central aperture 144 and the distal tip 166 of the blade 136. Figure 6C shows the cutting head 132 with its blades 136 in their retracted positions, such that they are fully within the circular perimeter of frame 134. Figure 7 shows a side view of blade 136. The blade has an elongate body that is relatively broad and thin in respective directions perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the body. The blade also has a mounting means in the form of a circular mounting hole 137 for pivotably mounting the body at the corresponding pivot location 138 on frame 134. The blade 136 has a cutting edge 162 that extends longitudinally along the blade body. The cutting edge has a serrated edge formed by five contiguous concave recesses 180 which are scalloped into the cutting edge 162 to provide the cutting edge with a serrated profile when the blade is viewed into a broad side of the blade body. Adjacent recesses 180 meet at points 181, so that the recesses 180 and points 181 form serrations along the cutting edge 162. The top and bottom sides 184 and 186, respectively, of edge blade 136 have a set of parallel ribs 188 that run across the breadth of the blade body and generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 189 of the blade body. Each rib 188 runs from the cutting edge 162 to a spine 190. The spine extends longitudinally along the blade 136, from its mounting hole 137 to its distal tip 166. The spine 190 is, for the most part, located proximal to the rear edge 164, so that the majority of the ribs 188 extend the majority of the distance between the cutting edge 162 and the rear edge 164. The spine 166 strengthens the blade against bending about an axis that is in the plane of the blade 136 and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 189. The set of ribs 188 includes ribs 188a on the top side 184 of the blade 136, and ribs 188b of the bottom side 186 of the blade 136. The ribs 188a on the top side are offset to be between respective ribs 188b of the bottom side 186 of the blade 136. In this manner the ribs 188(a,b) cooperate to provide the cutting edge 162 with a profile that zig-zags along the length of the cutting edge 162, when the blade 136 is viewed into cutting edge 162, as illustrated in Figure 7Α. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 7Α the profile has a zigzag pattern shaped as a zine waveform. In further embodiments, the zigzag pattern may be shaped as a triangle waveform. Other repeating zigzagging profiles are also possible. The ribs 188(a,b) are spaced such that there are approximately four ribs 188a and four ribs 188b between each point 181 (Figure 7) of the serration along the cutting edge 162. The zig-zag profile is believed to be advantageous by maintaining a sharpness to the cutting edge 162. It is believed that even once the serrations on the cutting edge have worn away, the zig-zag profile improves cutting efficiency compared with a flat-sided blade. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention provides a blade for an edge-trimmer cutting-head, the blade including: an elongate body that is relatively broad and thin in respective directions perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the body; a mounting means for pivotably mounting the body to a frame portion of the cutting head; and a cutting edge extending longitudinally along the body; wherein at least a portion of the cutting edge has a profile that zigzags along the length of the cutting edge when the blade is viewed into the cutting edge. Another aspect of the invention lies in the provision of a cutting blade having a serrated cutting edge and a zig-zag profile extending from the cutting edge 136 substantially towards a rear edge 164, for example as described in relation to Figures 7-7Α. Cutting heads and edgetrimmers in accordance with any other aspect of the invention may advantageously comprise these cutting blades. In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a cutting head for an edge trimmer for cutting grass and other vegetation. The head includes a frame including: a hub having a mounting aperture for mounting the frame on a drive shaft of the edge trimmer, the aperture defining a spin axis for the frame when the frame is mounted on the drive shaft, and an outer portion about the hub, defining a perimeter of the frame. A plurality of blades according to any one of claims 4 to 9 are pivotably mounted to the frame at respective locations along the outer portion. Each blade has a cutting edge and being pivotable between (i) an extended position in which a cutting portion of the blade, including the cutting edge, protrudes from the perimeter of the frame to cut vegetation, the extended position being defined by a positioning means and (ii) a retracted position defined by a respective retraction stop within the frame, wherein in the retracted position the blade is wholly within the perimeter of the frame. When the frame spins about the spin axis, the blades experience a centripetal force that biases the blades to the extended position, and when the blades encounter an obstruction in the extended position, the blades pivot towards the retracted position.
