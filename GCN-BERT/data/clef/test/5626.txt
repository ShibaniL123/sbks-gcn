The present invention relates to a composition comprising at least one organosilicon compound A comprising at least two identical or different hydrolyzable and condensable groups, or at least two silanol functions ≡SiOH, which are crosslinkable, curable or vulcanizable at room temperature into elastomer by polycondensation and which do not contain any alkyltin-based catalysts that have toxicity problems. The invention also relates to novel polycondensation catalysts in the chemistry of silicon compounds and in particular in the chemistry of silicones and to the uses thereof as catalysts for the polycondensation reaction of silicon compounds comprising at least two identical or different hydrolyzable and condensable groups, or at least two silanol functions ≡SiOH. Formulations of silicone compositions that crosslink via polycondensation generally involve a silicone oil, generally a polydimethylsiloxane, with hydroxyl end groups, optionally prefunctionalized with a silane so as to have hydrolyzable and condensable ends, a crosslinking agent, a polycondensation catalyst, conventionally a tin salt or an alkyl titanate, usually with a reinforcing filler and other optional additives such as bulking fillers, adhesion promoters, colorants, biocidal agents, etc. These silicone compositions which “cure” by polymerization and/or crosslinking at room temperature are well known to those skilled in the art and are classified into two distinct groups: one-pack compositions (RTV-1), which are in the form of only one part (or component) whose packaging is airtight, andtwo-pack compositions (RTV-2), which are in the form of two distinct parts (hence the name “two-pack”) and whose packaging containing the catalyst is airtight. The purpose of the airtight packagings is to avoid the silicone compositions containing the catalyst from coming into contact with atmospheric moisture during storage before use. During curing (by polymerization and/or crosslinking) of these silicone compositions, the water is provided by the atmospheric moisture in the case of the RTV-1 products. In the case of the RTV-2 products, dimethyltin dicarboxylates are commonly used as catalysts, but they require the addition of an amount of water to one of the parts in order to activate the catalyst and to allow the polycondensation reaction when the contents of the two parts are mixed in ambient air so as to form the elastomer network, which is reflected by curing of the composition. For example, the one-pack silicone compositions (RTV-1) used as mastics or adhesives crosslink without heating according to a mechanism involving a certain number of reactions that may be successive or simultaneous: a) functionalization which results from the placing of a silicone oil bearing silanol functions in contact with a crosslinking agent, occasionally known as a “scavenger”, such as a silane compound of SiX4 type (for example a silicate) or a compound bearing the following function —SiX3 with X usually being an alkoxy, acyloxy, amino, amido, enoxy, aminoxy, ketiminoxy or oxime function, which are well known for being reactive with silanol functions. The resulting product is usually known as a “functionalized oil”. This reaction may be desired directly during the preparation of the composition or optionally as a pre-step before the addition of the other components of the composition. In this pre-step, it is common practice to use a functionalization catalyst, for instance lithium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide so as to give the one-pack composition good stability on storage. To do this, a person skilled in the art may choose specific functionalization catalysts and will adjust the amount of the reagents so as to have a molar excess of crosslinking agent relative to the silanol functions to be functionalized, and b) crosslinking via a hydrolysis of the functionalized oil generally performed by means of water vapor which diffuses into the material from the surface exposed to the atmosphere, and a condensation between the silanol groups formed and other residual reactive functions. Generally, the polycondensation reaction kinetics are slow. These reactions are thus catalyzed with a suitable catalyst. As catalysts that are used, use is most often made of catalysts based on tin, titanium, an amine or compositions of these catalysts. Catalysts based on tin (cf. in particular FR-A-2 557 582) and on titanium (cf. in particular FR-A-2 786 497) are catalysts that are very effective. As regards the RTV-2 two-pack compositions, they are sold and stored in the form of two components (or parts), a first component (or part) comprising the polymers that are capable of polycondensing and the second component is airtight and contains the catalyst and usually the crosslinking agent. The two components (or parts) are mixed during use and the mixture crosslinks in the form of a relatively hard elastomer when the composition comprises reinforcing fillers. These two-pack compositions are well known and are described, in particular, in the book by Walter Noll “Chemistry and Technology of Silicones” 1968, 2nd Edition, on pages 395 to 398. These compositions essentially comprise 4 different ingredients: a reactive polymer such as an α,ω-bis(dimethylhydroxysilyl)polydimethylsiloxane,a crosslinking agent,a condensation catalyst, andoptionally water, which is usually present when a dialkyltin dicarboxylate is used as catalyst (activation of this catalyst by the presence of water). Usually, the condensation catalyst is based on an organic tin compound. Indeed, many tin-based catalysts have already been proposed as a catalyst for crosslinking these RTV-2 products. The most widely used compounds are alkyltin carboxylates such as tributyltin monooleate or dialkyltin dicarboxylates such as dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin diacetate or dimethyltin dilaurate (see the book by Noll “Chemistry and Technology of silicones” page 337, Academic Press, 1968—2nd Edition or patents EP 147 323 or EP 235 049). However, the alkyltin-based catalysts, although very effective, usually colorless, liquid and soluble in silicone oils, have the drawback of being toxic (CMR2 toxic for reproduction). Titanium-based catalysts, which are also extensively used in RTV-1 products, have, however, a major drawback: they have slower kinetics than tin-based catalysts. Furthermore, these catalysts cannot be used in RTV-2 products due to gelling problems. Other catalysts are sometimes mentioned, but they have only experienced minor industrial development due to their mediocre effectiveness. Among these catalysts, mention may be made of primary, secondary or tertiary organic amines, such as di-n-butylamine, diethylamine, etc. (see U.S. Pat. No. 3,440,207, column 5). These amines may be used alone or in combination with other catalysts. Thus, it may be seen that: in Example 9 (column 9), an amine used alone allows the curing of an RTV-1 composition within 3 hours of contact with atmospheric moisture, andin Example 2, an amine combined with a conventional catalyst such as dibutyltin dilaurate also allows the curing of an RTV-1 composition within 3 hours of contact with atmospheric moisture. Patent application US 2008/0 207 938 describes (Example 1, page 6) the in-situ functionalization of an α,ω-bis(dimethylhydroxysilyl)polydimethylsiloxane oil, using a mixture of two catalysts: a [Zn(acac)2.H2O] complex and a large molar excess of dibutylamine in the absence of atmospheric moisture. The process thus describes the preparation of a silicone oil bearing alkoxylated groups, which are known to be stable on storage since they are formulated as an RTV-1 one-pack composition. When a silicone elastomer obtained by curing on contact with atmospheric moisture was prepared and described (Example 10), a tin catalyst was added to the composition. The problem associated with the use of a large molar excess of dibutylamine during the functionalization is the strong probability of observing migration of the dibutylamine to the surface of the silicone elastomer, thus forming fouling harmful to applications such as those requiring food contact or good adhesion to specific supports (aluminum, etc.). For sustainable development, it therefore appears necessary to develop nontoxic catalysts for the polycondensation reaction of organopolysiloxanes. Another important aspect for an organopolysiloxane polycondensation reaction catalyst is the pot life, that is to say the time during which the composition can be used after mixing without curing. This time must be long enough to allow it to be used, but short enough to obtain a molded article that can be handled at the latest a few minutes or a few hours after it has been manufactured. The catalyst must thus make it possible to obtain a good compromise between the pot life of the catalyzed mixture and the time at the end of which the molded article can be handled (these times depend on the targeted application such as, for example, the molding or manufacture of seals). In addition, the catalyst must confer, on the catalyzed mixture, a spreading time which does not vary as a function of the storage time. The essential objective of the present invention is therefore to find novel catalysts that enable, in atmospheric moisture, both surface crosslinking and core crosslinking that is as complete as possible when they are used in RTV-1 one-pack compositions. Another essential objective of the present invention is to propose a catalyst that can be used both in the crosslinking of crosslinkable compositions into elastomer and which are in the form of a one-pack (RTV-1) or two-pack (RTV-2) composition. Another essential objective of the present invention is to propose a catalytic system that continues simultaneously to meet the constraints of storage, of processing and of crosslinking of the two types of one-pack and two-pack elastomer compositions. These objectives, among others, are achieved by the present invention, which relates firstly to a composition comprising: at least one organosilicon compound A comprising at least two identical or different hydrolyzable and condensable groups, or at least two silanol functions ≡SiOH,at least one crosslinking agent B,optionally at least one filler C, anda catalytically effective amount of at least one polycondensation catalyst M which is a zinc complex comprising in its structure a first type of ligand that is a β-diketonate and a second type of ligand that is an amine. The term “β-diketonate” means the enolate anion of a β-dicarbonyl compound. In the present specification, the nomenclature used for describing the β-diketonate ligands in the chemical structures of the zinc complexes according to the invention is based on the corresponding β-diketone, which is the non-anionic form of the β-diketonate ligand before its complexation with the zinc atom (preparation via the action of a base). For example, in the following notation: “[Zn(acac)2(n-propylamine)2], with the ligand acac=2,4-pentanedione”, it is understood that the zinc-complexing ligand is the corresponding pentanedionate anion: It is also understood that the term “complex” includes in its definition any monomeric, oligomeric or similar form of said zinc complex according to the invention. Preferentially, the polycondensation catalyst M is a zinc complex comprising in its structure at least two β-diketonate ligands and at least one amine ligand, and even more preferentially, the polycondensation catalyst M is a zinc complex comprising in its structure: at least two identical or different β-diketonate (bis[β-diketonate]) ligands, andone to two amine ligands. The inventors have, to their credit, found, entirely surprisingly and unexpectedly, that use should be made of zinc metal complexes comprising two specific types of ligands, namely β-dicarbonyl and amine ligands, to achieve crosslinking rates that are much more effective than those of zinc bis(β-diketonate) complexes, which, nevertheless, have structural similarities. The inventors have also, to their credit, overcome the technical prejudice that hitherto maintained that certain complexes of metals, for instance zinc, have only mediocre activity in the polycondensation reaction of organopolysiloxanes. The definition of the ligands is taken from the book “Chimie Organométallique” [Organometallic Chemistry] by Didier Astruc, published in 2000 by EDP Sciences: see, in particular, Chapter 1, “Les complexes monométalliques” [Single-metal complexes], pages 31 et seq. The catalyst according to the invention may be in the solid or liquid state. It may be incorporated alone or in a suitable solvent. When it is in solvent, a silicone oil or any other compatible solvent such as petroleum fractions may be added, and the solvent is then evaporated so as to transfer the catalyst into a silicone medium. The mixture obtained may then serve as a “catalyzing base”. According to a preferred embodiment, the polycondensation catalyst(s) M may be obtained: a) by reacting per 1 mol of at least one zinc complex of formula [Zn(β-diketonate)2] or of a mixture of two different zinc complexes of formula [Zn(β-diketonate)2]X1 mol of amine or a mixture of amine, with X1≦2.5 molar equivalents relative to the zinc, optionally in the presence of a solvent, so as to obtain a reaction product comprising: x mol of a zinc complex A which is a complex of formula [(Zn(β-diketonate)2)r(amine)]z′y mol of a zinc complex B which is a complex of formula [(Zn(β-diketonate)2)r(amine)2]z′, with x≧0, y≧0, the symbol r≧1 and preferably r=1, 2, 3 or 4, and the symbol z′ is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and preferably z′=1, 2, 3 or 4,optionally X3 mol of the complex [Zn(β-diketonate)2], andoptionally X4 mol of residual unreacted amine, andb) after optionally removing the solvent and the residual amine, the polycondensation catalyst(s) M are recovered in the form of at least one zinc complex A, at least one zinc complex B or a mixture of zinc complex A and of zinc complex B, with optionally a residual amount of X3 mol of the complex [Zn(β-diketonate)2], and the symbols X1, X3 and X4 are integers and the sum x+y+X3=1. The removal of the solvent and of the residual amine will be performed via any known technique (distillation, filtration, etc.). The preparation process takes care to remove any residual amine, so as to avoid any surface exudation of the amine when the elastomer is prepared by curing the composition on contact with atmospheric moisture. Removal of the solvent or of the residual amine will be performed via any known technique (distillation, filtration, etc.). It is known that [Zn(β-diketonate)2(amine)] or [Zn(β-diketonate)2(amine)2] structures may also form dimers, trimers or tetramers. Consequently, the definition of the catalyst according to the invention also includes the dimeric, trimeric or tetrameric forms of said catalyst according to the invention. Depending on the type of polycondensation catalyst M desired (monoamino or diamino zinc bis(β-diketonate) complex, or a mixture of these species), the number of moles of amine X1 will be adjusted in consequence: X1≧2 molar equivalents relative to the zinc, and <2.5 molar equivalents relative to the zinc, so as predominantly to obtain a complex of formula [(Zn(β-diketonate)2)r(amine)2]z′,1≦X1<2 molar equivalents relative to the zinc, so as to obtain a mixture of complexes: [(Zn(β-diketonate)2)r(amine)]z, and [(Zn(β-diketonate)2)r(amine)2]z′,X1<1 molar equivalent relative to the zinc, so as to obtain a mixture of complex [Zn(β-diketonate)2(amine)] and of unreacted complex [Zn(β-diketonate)2],with: the symbol r≧1 and preferably r=1, 2, 3 or 4, and the symbol z′ is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and preferably the symbol z′=1, 2, 3 or 4, and even more preferentially z′=1 or 2. Preferably, the number of moles of amine X1 added during the synthesis of the catalyst according to the invention will be ≦2.5 molar equivalents relative to the zinc to avoid the presence of an appreciable amount of free amine in the composition according to the invention. It is known that organic amines can migrate to the surface of the silicone elastomer, thus forming fouling, thus degrading the properties of the elastomer and at the same time contaminating the environment in the vicinity of the elastomer. Complexes of the type [Zn(β-diketonate)2] are for the most part commercially available or alternatively may be prepared according to a procedure described in international patent application WO 2009/106 718. Preferably, the number of moles of amine X1 added during the synthesis of the catalyst according to the invention will be ≦2.5 molar equivalents relative to the zinc to avoid the presence of an appreciable amount of free amine in the medium and which would not be desirable for the stability of the composition according to the invention. According to a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a composition comprising: at least one organosilicon compound A comprising at least two identical or different hydrolyzable and condensable groups, or at least two silanol functions ≡SiOH,at least one crosslinking agent B,optionally at least one filler C, anda catalytically effective amount of at least one polycondensation catalyst M which is a complex of formula (1) below: [in-line-formulae][Zn(C1)n′(C2)n″(L1)y′(L2)y″(X)x′]z′.(H2O)x″ (1)[/in-line-formulae]in which: the symbols C1 and C2 are identical or different ligands chosen from the group of β-diketonates,the symbols n′ and n″ are integers equal to 0, 1 or 2 with the condition that the sum n′+n″=2,the symbols L1 and L2 are identical or different ligands chosen from the group of amines,the symbols y′ and y″ represent the number of amine ligands and are integers equal to 0, 1 or 2 with the condition that the sum y′+y″=1 or 2,the symbol X is a ligand other than C1, C2, L1 and L2 and preferably a neutral ligand other than an amine and even more preferentially X is an H2O molecule,the symbol x′≧0, and preferably x′=0, 1, 2, 3 or 4,the symbol x″≧0, and preferably x″=0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, andthe symbol z′ is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and preferably z′=1 or 2. The ligand X is preferably a neutral ligand other than an amine, and the structure of which is of little importance. A person skilled in the art will use any type of precursor during the preparation of the catalyst M according to the invention such that this neutral ligand does not interfere with the reactivity of the catalyst. An example of a neutral ligand is, for example, a water molecule.

and with the ligand R50 which is the β-diketonate or the enolate anion of the following β-dicarbonyl compound=β-diketone stearoylbenzoylmethane of formula (7) below: with the ligand acac which is the

is the β-diketonate or the enolate anion of the following β-dicarbonyl compound=2,2,7-trimethyl-3,5-octanedione of formula (8) below: and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the amount of polycondensation catalyst M according to the invention is between 0.1% and 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition, preferably between 0.5% and 5%, whether it is a one-pack or two-pack preparation. According to a preferred embodiment, the composition according to the invention is free of tin-based catalyst, for instance tin dicarboxylates. This is made possible due to the good catalytic activity of the polycondensation catalyst M according to the invention. The organosilicon compounds A according to the invention may be an organosilane, an organosiloxane, an organopolysiloxane comprising at least two hydrolyzable and condensable groups, or at least two silanol functions ≡SiOH, or mixtures of such organosilicon compounds. Preferably, the organosilicon compound A according to the invention will bear at least two groups chosen from the group consisting of groups such as hydroxyl, alkoxy, alkoxy-alkylene-oxy, amino, amido, acylamino, aminoxy, iminoxy, ketiminoxy, acyloxy and enoxy. According to one embodiment, the organosilicon compound A is a polyorganosiloxane comprising: (i) at least two siloxyl units of formula (10) below: in which: the symbols R1, which may be identical or different, represent C1 to C30 monovalent hydrocarbon-based radicals,the symbols Z, which may be identical or different, each represent a hydrolyzable and condensable group or a hydroxyl group and are preferably chosen from the group consisting of groups of the following types: hydroxyl, alkoxy, alkoxy-alkylene-oxy, amino, amido, acylamino, aminoxy, iminoxy, ketiminoxy, acyloxy and enoxy,a is equal to 0, 1 or 2, b is equal to 1, 2 or 3, the sum a+b is equal to 1, 2 or 3, and optionally (ii) one or more siloxyl units of formula (11) below: in which: the symbols R, which may be identical or different, represent C1 to C30 monovalent hydrocarbon-based radicals optionally substituted with one or more halogen atoms or with amino, ether, ester, epoxy, mercapto or cyano groups, and the symbol c is equal to 0, 1, 2 or 3. Another important aspect for a composition that is crosslinkable via condensation reactions is the working time (pot life), that is to say the time during which the composition may be used after mixing without curing. For example, in a molding application, this time must be long enough to allow it to be used, but short enough to obtain a molded article that can be handled at the latest a few minutes or a few hours after it has been manufactured. The catalyst must thus make it possible to obtain a good compromise between the pot life of the catalyzed mixture and the time at the end of which the molded article can be handled (these times depend on the targeted application such as, for example, the molding or manufacture of seals). In addition, the components that are reactive in the presence of the catalyst must confer, on the catalyzed mixture, a spreading time which does not vary as a function of the storage time. Thus, when the organosilicon compound A is a polyorganosiloxane bearing at least two hydroxyl groups (of silanol type ≡SiOH), it has been discovered, surprisingly and unexpectedly, that when it is used in a composition according to the invention which comprises as catalyst a zinc complex bearing β-diketonate and amine ligands according to the invention, it is then possible to increase or decrease the “working time” (or pot life) by simply varying the molar mass of the organosilicon compound A within a specific range. Thus, by varying the weight-average molar masses (Mw) of the organosilicon compound A within a range of values greater than at least twice the entanglement molar mass Me, it is then possible to modify the “working time” (or pot life) without deteriorating the mechanical properties (for example the shore A hardness) of the elastomer obtained after crosslinking. Without being bound by theory, the formation of points of entanglement starting from a certain length of macromolecular chains for each type of polyorganosiloxane is thus possible starting from a certain entanglement molar mass of the polymer identified by the symbol “Me”. Thus, the “critical molar mass” noted Mc is defined as being equal to about twice the entanglement molar mass Me. Above the critical molar mass Mc, it was thus possible to control the “working time” (or pot life) of the silicone composition before crosslinking. As a guide and depending on the type of group present in the polyorganosiloxane bearing at least two hydroxyl groups of silanol type ≡SiOH, the entanglement molar mass Mc is between 15 000 and 30 000 g/mol. Thus, an advantageous embodiment consists in using an organosilicon compound A which is a polyorganosiloxane bearing at least two hydroxyl groups of silanol type ≡SiOH whose weight-average molar mass Mw is greater than at least twice the entanglement molar mass Me. Controlling, by virtue of the choice of the weight-average molar mass Mw of the organosilicon compound A, the presence or absence of entanglement of the polyorganosiloxane chains bearing at least two hydroxyl groups of silanol type ≡SiOH makes it possible simultaneously to control: the mechanical properties of the elastomer obtained after crosslinking of the composition according to the invention and especially the shore A hardness, andthe “working time” during which the composition is manipulable before crosslinking. Controlling the entanglement of the chains of the polyorganosiloxane bearing at least two hydroxyl groups of silanol type ≡SiOH will be performed by carefully selecting the weight-average molar mass Mw of the polymer so that its molar mass is at least twice as large as the entanglement molar mass, i.e. it will be greater than the critical molar mass Mc of this polymer. Preferably, the organosilicon compound A is a polyorganosiloxane of general formula (13): [in-line-formulae]Z1R3-nSi—O—(SiR2—O)x—SiR3-nZn (13)[/in-line-formulae]in which:the symbols Z, which may be identical or different, each represent a hydrolyzable and condensable group or a hydroxyl group and are preferably chosen from the group consisting of groups of the following types: hydroxyl, alkoxy, alkoxy-alkylene-oxy, amino, amido, acylamino, aminoxy, iminoxy, ketiminoxy, acyloxy and enoxy,the symbols R, which may be identical or different, represent C1 to C30 monovalent hydrocarbon-based radicals optionally substituted with one or more halogen atoms or with amino, ether, ester, epoxy, mercapto or cyano groups,the symbol n is equal to 1, 2 or 3, preferably equal to 2 or 3 and when Z is a hydroxyl group, then n=1,the symbol x is between 200 and 10000, preferably between 200 and 1000 and even more preferentially between 250 and 600. In formulae (10), (11) and (13), the symbols R1 and R are preferably: alkyl radicals containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms optionally substituted with: 1 or more aryl or cycloalkyl groups, with one or more halogen atoms or with amino, ether, ester, epoxy, mercapto, cyano or (poly)glycol groups. Examples that may be mentioned include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, 2-ethylhexyl, octyl, decyl, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl, 4,4,4-trifluorobutyl and 4,4,4,3,3-pentafluorobutyl radicals, cycloalkyl and halo cycloalkyl radicals containing from 5 to 13 carbon atoms, such as cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclohexyl, propylcyclohexyl, 2,3-difluorocyclobutyl and 3,4-difluoro-5-methylcycloheptyl radicals,mononuclear aryl and haloaryl radicals containing from 6 to 13 carbon atoms, such as phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, chlorophenyl, dichlorophenyl or trichlorophenyl radicals, oralkenyl radicals containing from 2 to 8 carbon atoms, such as vinyl, allyl or 2-butenyl radicals. The dynamic viscosity of the organosilicon compound A is generally between 50 and 5 000 000 mPa·s at 25° C. and preferably between 100 and 1 000 000 mPa·s. It is specified that the viscosity values in the present specification are dynamic viscosity values measured at 25° C. using a Brookfield viscometer. In the particular case where the organosilicon compound A is a polyorganosiloxane of general formula (13) with symbols Z of hydroxyl type, then the symbol n will preferably be equal to 1. In this case, it is preferred to use alpha,omega-dihydroxy polyorganosiloxanes which are generally oils whose dynamic viscosity usually ranges between 100 mPa·s at 25° C. and 1 000 000 mPa·s at 25° C., preferably from 800 mPa·s to 500 000 mPa·s at 25° C. When it is desired to control the service life of the bath, for example, in a molding application, it will be arranged such that the choice of the organosilicon compound A is made as a function of the weight-average molar mass Mw (M, greater than at least twice the entanglement molar mass Me). For a molding application and when the compound is a polydimethylsiloxane ending with silanol functions (≡SiOH), its viscosity will preferably be greater than 750 mPa·s and even more preferentially between 1000 mPa·s and 20 000 mPa·s. When the organosilicon compound A is a polyorganosiloxane, it is advantageous to use those in which at least 60% of the radicals R and R1 (in formulae 4 and 5) or of the radical R (in formula 6) are methyl radicals, the other radicals generally being phenyl and/or vinyl radicals. According to the invention, the symbols Z each represent a hydroxyl group or a hydrolyzable and condensable group which are preferably chosen from the group consisting of groups of the following types: alkoxy, alkoxy-alkylene-oxy, amino, amido, acylamino, aminoxy, iminoxy, ketiminoxy, acyloxy and enoxy. When the organosilicon compound A contains hydrolyzable and condensable groups Z according to the invention and is a polyorganosiloxane, it is usually described as a functionalized polymer and corresponds to a form that is stable in the absence of moisture which may be used in a one-pack composition and may thus be packaged in hermetically sealed cartridges, which will be opened by the operator during use to form, after curing, a cured elastomer. When the organosilicon group A contains groups Z of hydroxyl type, they may be functionalized in situ in the one-pack compositions, via a functionalization catalyst such as lithium hydroxide, so as to be able to store them and package them in hermetically sealed cartridges. As examples of hydrolyzable and condensable groups Z of alkoxy type, mention may be made of groups containing from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, such as methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, isobutoxy, sec-butoxy, tert-butoxy, 2-methoxyethoxy, hexyloxy or octyloxy groups.

As an example of hydrolyzable and condensable groups Z of amido type, mention may be made of the N-methylacetamido group. As an example of hydrolyzable and condensable groups Z of acylamino type, mention may be made of the benzoylamino group. As examples of hydrolyzable and condensable aminoxy groups Z, mention may be made of dimethylaminoxy, diethylaminoxy, dioctylaminoxy or diphenylaminoxy groups. As examples of hydrolyzable and condensable groups Z of iminoxy and in particular ketiminoxy type, mention may be made of groups derived from the following oximes: acetophenone oxime, acetone oxime, benzophenone oxime, methylethylketoxime, diisopropylketoxime or methylisobutylketoxime. As an example of hydrolyzable and condensable groups Z of enoxy type, mention may be made of the 2-propenoxy group.

These crosslinking agents B are products that are available on the silicones market; furthermore, their use in room-temperature curing compositions is known; it is featured especially in French patents FR-A-1 126 411, FR-A-1 179 969, FR-A-1 189 216, FR-A-1 198 749, FR-A-1 248 826, FR-A-1 314 649, FR-A-1 423 477, FR-A-1 432 799 and FR-A-2 067 636. Among the crosslinking agents B, preference is more particularly given to alkyltrialkoxysilanes, alkyl silicates and polyalkyl silicates, in which the organic radicals are alkyl radicals containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. As other examples of crosslinking agents B that may be used, mention may be made more particularly of polyethyl silicate, poly(n-propyl silicate) and the following silanes: propyltrimethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxysilane, ethyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, propyltriethoxysilane, tetramethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, tetrapropoxysilane, tetrabutoxysilane 1,2-bis(trimethoxysilyl)ethane, 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane, tetraisopropoxysilane, phenyltriethoxysilane, methyltris(methylethylketoximo)silane, 3-cyanopropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-cyanopropyltriethoxysilane, 3-(glycidyloxy)propyltriethoxysilane, vinyltris(methylethylketoximo)silane, tetrakis(methylethylketoximo)silane, acyloxysilanes such as vinyltriacetoxysilane, methyltriacetoxysilane or ethyltriacetoxysilane or alternatively those having the following formulae: CH3Si(OCH3)3; C2H5Si(OC2H5)3; C2H5Si(OCH3)3 CH2═CHSi(OCH3)3; CH2═CHSi(OCH2CH2OCH3)3 C6H5Si(OCH3)3; [CH3][OCH(CH3)CH2OCH3]Si[OCH3]2 Si(OCH3)4; Si(OC2H5)4; Si(OCH2CH2CH3)4; Si(OCH2CH2CH2CH3)4 Si(OC2H4OCH3)4; CH3Si(OC2H4OCH3)3, CH2Si(OC2H5)3. Use is generally made of 0.1 to 60 parts by weight of crosslinking agent B per 100 parts by weight of organosilicon compound A. Preferably, use is made of 1 to 15 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of organosilicon compound A. As fillers C, use may be made of mineral fillers that are very finely divided products with a mean particle diameter of less than 0.1 μm. The fillers C, preferably reinforcing silicas, are generally used in a proportion of from 1 to 150 parts and preferably from 8 to 100 parts per 100 parts of organosilicon compound A. They are chosen from combustion silicas and precipitation silicas. They have a specific surface area, measured according to the BET and CTAB methods, of at least 50 m2/g and preferably greater than 70 m2/g, a mean primary particle size of less than 80 nm and an apparent density of less than 200 g/liter. These silicas may be incorporated in unmodified form or after having been treated with organosilicon compounds usually used for this purpose. Among these compounds are methylpolysiloxanes such as hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, methylpolysilazanes such as hexamethyldisilazane, hexamethylcyclotrisilazane, chlorosilanes such as dimethyldichlorosilane, trimethylchlorosilane, methylvinyldichlorosilane, dimethylvinylchlorosilane, alkoxysilanes such as dimethyldimethoxysilane, dimethylvinylethoxysilane, trimethylmethoxysilane. In addition to or instead of the reinforcing silicas, semi-reinforcing or bulking mineral fillers may be added. These fillers are coarser and have a mean particle diameter of greater than 0.1 μm. These fillers are more especially represented by ground quartz, calcined clays, diatomaceous silicas, calcium carbonate, iron oxide, titanium oxide, magnesium oxide, aluminum oxide, zinc sulfate and barium sulfate. They are generally introduced in a proportion of from 1 to 120 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of organosilicon compound A. These mineral fillers may be used in unmodified form, i.e. untreated, or treated with the organosilicon compounds mentioned above in the case of the reinforcing silicas. The purpose of introducing fillers is to give good rheological properties to the composition before crosslinking and good mechanical properties to the elastomers that result from the curing of the compositions in accordance with the invention. In combination with these fillers, use may be made of mineral and/or organic pigments and also agents that improve the thermal resistance (salts and oxides of rare-earth elements such as ceric oxides and hydroxides) and/or the fire resistance of the elastomers. For example, the oxide cocktails described in international application WO 98/29488 can be used. Among the agents that improve the fire resistance, mention may be made of halogenated organic derivatives, organophosphorus derivatives, platinum derivatives such as chloroplatinic acid (its products from reaction with alkanols, ether oxides), and platinous chloride-olefin complexes. These pigments and agents together represent at most 20% of the weight of the fillers. The composition according to the invention may also comprise at least one adhesion promoter E, for instance organosilicon compounds bearing both: (1) one or more hydrolyzable groups bonded to the silicon atom, and(2) one or more organic groups substituted with radicals comprising a nitrogen atom or chosen from the group of (meth)acrylate, epoxy and alkenyl radicals, and more preferably still from the group constituted by the following compounds, taken alone or as a mixture: vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMO);3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GLYMO);methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MEMO);[H2N(CH2)3]Si(OCH2CH2CH3)3;[H2N(CH2)3]Si(OCH3)3;[H2N(CH2)3]Si(OC2H5)3;[H2N(CH2)4]Si(OCH3)3;[H2NCH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2]SiCH3(OCH3)2;[H2NCH2]Si(OCH3)3;[n-C4H9—HN—CH2]Si(OCH3)3;[H2N(CH2)2NH(CH2)3]Si(OCH3)3;[H2N(CH2)2NH(CH2)3]Si(OCH2CH2OCH3)3;[CH3NH(CH2)2NH(CH2)3]Si(OCH3)3;[H(NHCH2CH2)2NH(CH2)3]Si(OCH3)3; or polyorganosiloxane oligomers containing such organic groups in a content of greater than 20%. Besides the main constituents, nonreactive linear polyorganosiloxane polymers (G) may be introduced with the intention of acting on the physical characteristics of the compositions in accordance with the invention and/or on the mechanical properties of the elastomers resulting from the curing of these compositions. These nonreactive linear polyorganosiloxane polymers (G) are well known; they more especially comprise: α,ω-bis(triorganosiloxy)diorganopolysiloxane polymers with viscosities of at least 10 mPa·s at 25° C., formed essentially from diorganosiloxy units and from at most 1% of monoorganosiloxy and/or siloxy units, the organic radicals bonded to the silicon atoms being chosen from methyl, vinyl and phenyl radicals, 60% at least of these organic radicals being methyl radicals and 10% at most being vinyl radicals. The viscosity of these polymers can reach several tens of millions of mPa·s at 25° C.; they therefore include oils with a fluid to viscous appearance and soft to hard gums. They are prepared according to the usual techniques described more precisely in French patents FR-A-978 058, FR-A-1 025 150, FR-A-1 108 764 and FR-A-1 370 884. Use is preferably made of α,ω-bis(trimethylsiloxy)dimethylpolysiloxane oils with a viscosity ranging from 10 mPa·s to 1000 mPa·s at 25° C. These polymers, which act as plasticizers, may be introduced in a proportion of at most 70 parts by weight, preferably of 5 to 20 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the organosilicon compound A. The compositions according to the invention may moreover advantageously comprise at least one silicone resin (H). These silicone resins are branched organopolysiloxane polymers which are well known and which are available commercially. They have, per molecule, at least two different units chosen from those of formula R′″3SiO12 (M unit), R′″2SiO2/2 (D unit), R′″SiO3/2 (T unit) and SiO4/2 (Q unit) with at least one of the units being a unit T or Q. The R′″radicals are identical or different and are chosen from linear or branched alkyl radicals or vinyl, phenyl or 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl radicals. Preferably, the alkyl radicals have from 1 to 6 carbon atoms inclusive. More particularly, mention may be made, as examples of alkyl R radicals, of methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl and n-hexyl radicals. These resins are preferably hydroxylated and, in this case, have a weight content of hydroxyl group of between 5 and 500 meq./100 g. Examples of resins that may be mentioned include MQ resins, MDQ resins, TD resins and MDT resins. Other customary auxiliary agents and additives may be incorporated into the composition according to the invention; these are chosen as a function of the applications in which said compositions are used. The composition according to the invention may comprise the following amounts: per 100 parts by weight of at least one organosilicon compound A comprising at least two identical or different hydrolyzable and condensable groups, or at least two silanol functions ≡SiOH,from 0.1 to 60 parts by weight, preferably from 1 to 15 parts by weight, of at least one crosslinking agent B,from 0 to 150 parts by weight of at least one filler C,from 0 to 20 parts by weight of at least one adhesion promoter E,from 0 to 150 parts by weight of at least one nonreactive linear polyorganosiloxane polymer G,from 0 to 50 parts by weight of at least one silicone resin H, anda catalytically effective amount of at least one polycondensation catalyst M according to the invention. According to one variant of the invention, the composition according to the invention does not contain any catalyst containing in its structure at least one tin atom. According to another variant of the invention, the polycondensation catalyst M is the only polycondensation catalyst present in said composition, which may optionally contain at least one functionalization catalyst. Another subject of the invention relates to an RTV-2 two-pack composition, the precursor of the composition according to the invention and as described above, which is in two distinct packages P1 and P2, characterized in that: the package P1, which is airtight, comprises: a catalytically effective amount of at least one polycondensation catalyst M as defined above, andat least one crosslinking agent B, andthe package P2 does not contain said polycondensation catalyst M and said crosslinking agent B and comprises: per 100 parts by weight of at least one organosilicon compound A as defined above, andfrom 0 to 10 part(s) by weight of water. According to an advantageous variant of the invention, the package P1 and P2 do not contain any catalyst containing in its structure at least one tin atom. According to an advantageous embodiment, it has been discovered that, in molding applications, and for an RTV-2 two-pack composition according to the invention comprising at least one catalyst according to the invention combined with an α,ω-dihydroxylated polydimethylsiloxane oil as organosilicon compound A, it is then possible to modify the lifetime of the bath, after mixing the contents P1 and P2 just before use, by simply varying the viscosity of the α,ω-dihydroxylated polydimethylsiloxane oil chosen while at the same time choosing an oil with a molecular mass Mw greater than at least twice the critical entanglement molar mass Mc of this polymer. Thus, it has been discovered that by combining a catalyst according to the invention associated with at least one α,ω-dihydroxylated polydimethylsiloxane oil whose viscosity is between 2000 mPa·s and 5000 mPa·s, and preferably between 3000 and 4000 mPa·s, it is then possible to increase the lifetime of the bath when the parts P1 and P2 are combined just before use in a molding application, without deteriorating the hardness properties when the composition is hardened after crosslinking (Shore A hardness, SAH at 24 hours and at 4 days). Thus, according to a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to an RTV-2 two-pack composition for a molding application, the precursor of the composition as defined according to any one of claims 1 to 14, which is in two distinct packages P1 which is airtight and P2, characterized in that: the package P1 comprises: a catalytically effective amount of at least one polycondensation catalyst M according to the invention and as defined above, andat least one crosslinking agent B preferably as defined above, andthe package P2 does not contain said polycondensation catalyst M and said crosslinking agent B and comprises: per 100 parts by weight of at least one organosilicon compound A which is preferably a α,ω-bis(dimethylhydroxysilyl)polydimethylsiloxane whose dynamic viscosity at 25° C. is between 2000 mPa·s and 5000 mPa·s and preferably between 3000 mPa·s and 4000 mPa·s, andfrom 0 to 10 part(s) by weight of water. One of the advantages of these novel RTV-2 compositions according to the invention over conventional polycondensation RTV-2 products using dialkyltin dicarboxylate catalysts is that it is no longer necessary to add water to the part P2 since the catalyst according to the invention does not need to be activated, thus simplifying the formulation. Another subject of the invention relates to an RTV-1 one-pack composition which is in a single airtight package P, comprising: a) at least one organosilicon compound A comprising at least two identical or different hydrolyzable and condensable groups, or at least two silanol functions ≡SiOH,b) at least one crosslinking agent B, andc) a catalytically effective amount of at least one polycondensation catalyst M, andd) optionally at least one filler C. According to one variant of the invention, the RTV-1 one-pack composition according to the invention does not contain any catalyst containing in its structure at least one tin atom. For the RTV-1 one-pack composition or RTV-2 two-pack composition, other components may be present, such as: the adhesion promoter E, the nonreactive linear polyorganosiloxane polymer G, the silicone resin H and the other additives as described in the present specification. An RTV-2 two-pack composition is in two separate packages P1, which contains the catalyst and is airtight, and P2. They are packaged, after incorporation of the catalyst, in two separate fractions, one of the fractions possibly containing, for example, only the catalyst according to the invention or a mixture with the crosslinking agent. The manufacture of the RTV-2 two-pack compositions in accordance with the invention is also performed by mixing the various constituents in suitable equipment. RTV-2 two-pack compositions are described in detail, for example, in patents EP 118 325, EP 117 772, EP 10 478, EP 50 358, EP 184 966, U.S. Pat. No. 3,801,572 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,888,815 cited as reference. An RTV-1 one-pack composition is in a single airtight package P that is stable on storage in the absence of moisture, which can be cured in the presence of moisture, in particular moisture provided by the ambient air or by water generated within the base during the use thereof. In order to manufacture the compositions according to the invention it is preferable, in the case of the one-pack compositions, to use equipment that makes it possible to intimately mix the various fundamental constituents in a moisture-free environment, with or without a supply of heat, optionally added to which constituents are the aforementioned adjuvants and additives. All these ingredients may be loaded into the equipment in any order of introduction. Thus, it is possible first to mix the organosilicon compound A and the fillers C and then to add to the slurry obtained the crosslinking agent B, and optionally the other components when they are present and finally the polycondensation catalyst M according to the invention. It is also possible to mix the organosilicon compound A, the crosslinking agent B, the filler C and optionally the other components and subsequently to add the polycondensation catalyst M according to the invention. During these operations, the mixtures may be heated to a temperature from 50° C. to 180° C. at atmospheric pressure or under a reduced pressure in order to promote the removal of volatile materials. The RTV-1 one-pack composition in accordance with the invention is used in unmodified form, i.e. undiluted, or in the form of dispersions in diluents, and is stable on storage in the absence of moisture or water and cure at low temperatures (after removal of the solvents in the case of dispersions) in the presence of water to form elastomers. RTV-1 one-pack compositions are described in detail, for example, in patents EP 141 685, EP 147 323, EP 102 268, EP 21 859, FR 2 121 289 and FR 2 121 631, cited as reference. After the deposition in unmodified form of the compositions according to the invention, prepared from an RTV-1 one-pack composition, onto solid substrates, in a humid atmosphere, it is observed that a process of curing into elastomers occurs, it takes place from the outside to the inside of the mass deposited. A skin forms first at the surface, then the crosslinking continues in depth. The complete formation of the skin, which results in a tack-free feel of the surface, requires a period of time of a few minutes; this period of time depending on the degree of relative humidity of the atmosphere surrounding the compositions and on the crosslinkability of the latter. Furthermore, the in-depth curing of the deposited layers, which must be sufficient to allow the demolding and handling of the elastomers formed, requires a longer period of time. Indeed, this period of time depends not only on the factors mentioned above for the formation of the tack-free feel but also on the thickness of the deposited layers, which thickness generally lies between 0.5 mm and several centimeters. The one-pack compositions may be used for multiple applications such as jointing in the construction industry, assembling the most diverse materials (metals, plastics, natural and synthetic rubbers, wood, board, earthenware, brick, ceramic, glass, stone, concrete, masonry units), insulating electrical conductors, the potting of electronic circuits, or the preparation of molds used for manufacturing articles made of synthetic resins or foams. The compositions in accordance with the invention may be used for multiple applications such as jointing and/or bonding in the construction industry, in the transport industry (examples: motor vehicle, aerospace, railway, maritime and aeronautical), assembling the most diverse materials (metals, plastics, natural and synthetic rubbers, wood, cardboard, polycarbonate, earthenware, brick, ceramic, glass, stone, concrete, masonry units), insulating electrical conductors, the potting of electronic circuits, and the preparation of molds used for manufacturing articles made of synthetic resins or foams. It is possible to add, to these one-pack bases, adhesion promoters E chosen, for example, from organosilicon compounds simultaneously bearing, on the one hand, organic groups substituted by radicals chosen from the group of amino, ureido, isocyanate, epoxy, alkenyl, isocyanurate, hydantoyl, guanidino and mercaptoester radicals and, on the other hand, hydrolyzable groups, in general alkoxy groups bonded to the silicon atoms. Examples of such adhesion agents are described in United States patents U.S. Pat. No. 3,517,001, U.S. Pat. No. 4,115,356, U.S. Pat. No. 4,180,642, U.S. Pat. No. 4,273,698, U.S. Pat. No. 4,356,116 and in European patents EP 31 996 and EP 74 001. The compositions according to the invention are particularly useful for molding applications, in particular when they are in the RTV-2 two-pack form. For the use of the compositions according to the invention in this application, the techniques of casting or of application via a spatula or a brush or by spraying are useful. Examples of molding techniques that may be mentioned include: “box moulding”, which is intended for the manufacture of self-supporting molds, in one or more parts, by simple casting of the composition after mixing the two parts of the RTV-2 in liquid form on the initial master cast. This process is preferred for relatively simple forms without substantial reverse tapers;“molding in encasing in one or two parts”, and“compression molding”, which is preferred for making an imprint of inclined, vertical or overhanging master casts, generally of large size or when it is impossible to move the master cast. Another subject of the invention relates to an elastomer obtained: after mixing the contents of the packages P1 and P2 of the RTV-2 two-pack composition according to the invention and as described above and leaving the mixture to cure,after placing in contact with atmospheric moisture the contents of the package P of the RTV-1 one-pack composition according to the invention and as described above and leaving said contents to cure, orafter preparing the composition according to the invention and as described above and leaving the mixture to cure in the presence of water or of atmospheric moisture. Another subject of the invention relates to a process for coating the composition according to the invention and as defined above onto a flexible support S which is made of textile, paper, polyvinyl chloride, polyester, polypropylene, polyamide; polyethylene; polyurethane or polyethylene terephthalate, comprising steps a), b) and c) below: a) a composition according to the invention and as defined above is prepared, b) said composition is then deposited in continuous or batch manner onto said flexible support S, and c) said silicone composition X is left to crosslink in the presence of moisture provided by the ambient air or by prior addition of water so as to form a silicone elastomer. The coating of silicone compositions according to the invention onto flexible supports targets numerous applications. For example, when the flexible support is a textile, water-repellency properties are sought, or, when the support is a paper or a polymer such as PVC, PET, etc., non-stick properties are usually sought. Thus, once applied to a support, the silicone composition according to the invention crosslinks by means of the atmospheric moisture and/or by the presence of water in the composition to form a solid coating of silicone elastomer. In these liquid silicone coating compositions, the silicone phase may be diluted in a solvent. According to one variant of the process according to the invention, the composition in step a) is prepared after mixing the contents of the packages P1 and P2 of the RTV-2 two-pack composition according to the invention and as defined above or using the contents of the package P of the RTV-1 one-pack composition according to the invention and as defined above. The flexible supports S coated with a non-stick silicone film or with a non-stick silicone coat cured by crosslinking are chosen from the group consisting of supports made of textile, paper, polyvinyl chloride, polyester, polypropylene, polyamide; polyethylene; polyurethane or polyethylene terephthalate. For the purposes of the invention, the term “textile” is a generic term including all textile structures. The textiles may consist of yarns, fibers, filaments and/or other materials. They especially comprise flexible fabrics, whether they are woven, bonded, knitted, plaited, felted, needled, sewn, or made via another manufacturing method. These textiles may be openwork, i.e. they may comprise open spaces not comprising any textile. In order for the coating of the silicone composition of the invention to be efficient, it is preferable for the smallest of the dimensions of these open spaces to be less than 5 mm and especially less than 1 mm. According to the invention, any type of flexible textile support S may be used. As a guide, mention may be made of: natural textile fibers, such as: textiles of vegetable origin, such as cotton, flax, hemp, jute, coconut, paper cellulose fibers; and textiles of animal origin, such as wool, hairs, leather and silks;artificial textiles, such as: cellulose-based textiles, such as cellulose or derivatives thereof; and protein-based textiles of animal or vegetable origin; andsynthetic textiles, such as polyester, polyamide, polymalic alcohols, polyvinyl chloride, polyacrylonitrile, polyolefins, acrylonitrile, (meth)acrylate-butadiene-styrene copolymers and polyurethane. The synthetic textiles obtained by polymerization or polycondensation may especially comprise in their matrices various types of additives, such as pigments, delustering agents, matt-effect agents, catalysts, heat and/or light stabilizers, antistatic agents, flame retardants, and antibacterial, antifungal and/or antiacarian agents. As flexible textile types of support, mention may be made especially of supports obtained by rectilinear entanglement of yarns or fabrics, supports obtained by curvilinear interlacing of yarns or knits, mixtilinear surfaces or tulles, nonwoven supports and composite supports. Among the multitude of possible textile supports that may be used in the process of the invention, mention may be made of felts, denims, jacquard wovens, needled fabrics, sewn fabrics, crocheted fabrics, grenadines, laces and laceworks, damasks, webs, alpacas, baratheas, dimity fabrics, loop fabrics, brocades, calicos, velvets, canvasses, chiffons, flocked fabrics, sized fabrics, cheese-cloths, plaited fabrics, failles, foulard fabrics, gauzes, geotextiles, grandrelles, cushioned fabrics, tufted fabrics, organzas, pleated fabrics, ribbons and toiles. The flexible textile support S used in the process of the present invention may consist of one or more identical or different textiles, assembled in various ways. The textile may be a monolayer or multilayer textile. The textile support may consist, for example, of a multilayer structure which may be made via various assembly means, such as mechanical means, for instance sewing, welding, or spot or continuous bonding. The flexible textile support S may undergo, besides the coating process according to the present invention, one or more other subsequent treatments, also known as finishing or dry-filling treatments. These other treatments may be performed before, after and/or during said coating process of the invention. As other subsequent treatments, mention may be made especially of: dyeing, printing, back-bonding, coating, assembly with other materials or textile surfaces, washing, degreasing, preforming or fixing. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the flexible textile support S is a lace or an elastic band. The textiles thus obtained, in unmodified form or transformed into textile articles, may be used in numerous applications, for instance in the field of clothing, especially lingerie such as panty waistband or bra lacing, and hygiene articles, such as strapping tapes or dressings. These textile articles may be repositioned in various places of the body or of an item of clothing, for example by means of the adherence provided by the silicone elastomer. In practice, the rate of deposition of the composition according to the invention onto the flexible support S is between 0.1 and 1 and preferably between 0.3 and 0.5 g/m2, which corresponds to thicknesses of the order of a micrometer.

Example with Benzoylstearoylmethane (R50): β-diketone stearoylbenzoylmethane of formula (7) below: To a suspension of 98.1 g of benzoylstearoylmethane (R50) in 260 g of toluene are added 54 g of a solution of sodium methoxide at 25% in methanol at 20° C., to give a pale yellow homogeneous medium. After 30 minutes, 34.8 g of a solution of zinc chloride at 50% in methanol are added and, after 1 hour, 16.5 g of dibutylamine are added to the suspension. After 30 minutes, the sodium chloride is filtered off and the solution is evaporated at 60° C. and 2 mbar to give 120.7 g of the expected complex (100% yield) as a pale yellow liquid which crystallizes over time (b.p. about 40° C.). Depending on whether one or two equivalents of amine were added, the following complexes were prepared: —[Zn(R50)2(N-dibutylamine)],—[Zn(R50)2(N-dibutylamine)2], All the structures were confirmed by 1H NMR analysis. Example 2 Application in an RTV-1 One-Pack System In RTV-1, the slurry used is prepared as follows: 16 g of a solution of lithium hydroxide at 2% by weight in methanol, then, after 5 min, 400 g of AE55 fumed silica are added, with stirring, to a mixture of 3464 g of a polydimethylsiloxane ended with siloxyl units MOH of the following formula: (CH3)2(OH)SiO1/2, with a dynamic viscosity at 25° C. of 20 000 mPa·s and of 120 g of vinyltrimethoxysilane. The mixture was devolatilized under vacuum then stored in a moisture-free environment. For each test, the catalyst tested was mixed with 50 g of this slurry, and the catalytic potential was then evaluated in 3 ways (see the tables of results below): the skin-over time (SOT), time at the end of which surface crosslinking is observed, on a 2 mm film;the persistence of a tacky feel at 48 h;the hardness (Shore A hardness) of a 6 mm thick bead under controlled conditions (23° C. and 50% relative humidity) and over increasing times (2, 3, 4, 7 and 14 days). The high temperature stability was also evaluated by hardness measurements carried out on the bead after 7 days at room temperature followed by 7 days at 100° C. NB: The Shore hardness was measured on a 6 mm bead. In the tables of results the symbol “>” corresponds to the hardness values measured on the upper part of the bead and the symbol “<” corresponds to the hardness values measured on the lower part of the bead that is less exposed to the ambient air than the upper part.

Crosslinking is obtained after manual mixing using a spatula, at 23° C. The crosslinking kinetics profile is expressed by the pot life and the SAH 24 h measurement.

Various amines are tested. The compositions are detailed in tables 4 and 5. The results are collated below.

The above examples demonstrate the efficacy of these novel catalysts for catalyzing the polycondensation reaction and for forming an elastomeric network with good mechanical properties, similar to those obtained conventionally with tin. Furthermore, it is noted that the crosslinking takes place in the same manner when confined and on contact with air (specifically, the SAH results are equivalent on the confined face and on the upper face). Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the reactivity of the zinc diketonate catalysts may be modified by modifying the nature of the amine ligand, thus making it possible to obtain various kinetic profiles that are particularly suited to the various needs of the molding application: with the complexes [Zn(R50)2(OA)] and [Zn(R50)2(DMEDA)0.5]**, a good compromise for the molding application in general is achieved in terms of the pot life (lifetime of the bath) without loss of hardness at 24 hours and finally. For [Zn(R50)2 (DMEDA)0.5]**: In the case where, during the synthesis, a variable amount of amine is used (>0 equivalent and <2 equivalents, or a slight excess), a mixture is obtained comprising the complexes: [Zn(β-diketonate)2(amine)]+[Zn(β-diketonate)2(amine)2]. The following nomenclature will then be used in this case: [Zn(β-diketonate)2(amine)x]* and the value of the symbol “x” refers to the number of moles of amine added during the preparation of the complex and which have reacted (i.e. which are present in the complex as ligand). This type of nomenclature will be identified in the examples by insertion of the symbol “*” into the formula of the complex. with the complexes of mean formulae [Zn(R50)2(DBA)], [Zn(R50)2(MBA)], [Zn(R50)2(DIPA)] and [Zn(R50)2(EBA)], it is possible to greatly accelerate the crosslinking kinetics, which is occasionally necessary in order to increase the production efficiency, while at the same time conserving an acceptable pot life. 4b) Examples 2a and 2b In these examples, RTV-2 products are prepared by mixing a part P2 (a or b) with parts P1 containing the synthesized catalyst of mean formula [Zn(ND)2(OA)] and various amounts of partially hydrolyzed and condensed ethyl silicate as crosslinking agent. The compositions are detailed in tables 4 and 5. The results are collated below.

The catalyst is added (with stirring between each addition) and the mixture is stirred at 700 rpm. Samples (about 0.5 ml) are taken after 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour or more. A few drops of butyl titanate are added to the samples. If the conversion is not complete, a gel forms instantaneously during mixing using a spatula. If the conversion is complete, the mixture remains fluid. The results of this test are given in the “Functionalization complete in” column in Table 8 below: 5-b) Evaluation of the Catalysts in a Crosslinking Reaction (Curing on Contact with Atmospheric Moisture after Functionalization) 70 g of an α,ω-bis(dimethylhydroxysilyl)polydimethylsiloxane oil with a dynamic viscosity at 25° C. of 750 mPa·s (48V750 oil), 6 g of methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) and 3 g of vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMO) are mixed together in a 100 ml polypropylene jar, the test catalyst is added and the mixture is stirred at 700 rpm with a magnetic bar and under an argon atmosphere, i.e. in the absence of atmospheric moisture, for 1 hour so as to perform the functionalization. The mixture is then poured into the lid of the container and placed in the presence of atmospheric moisture so as to estimate the catalytic effect on the curing of the composition. The activities of catalysts according to the invention [Zn(acac)2(DBA)][Zn(acac)2(DBA)2] were compared with the separate addition of the complex [Zn(acac)2.H2O] followed by the addition of an amount of 243 μl (large molar access) of N,N-dibutylamine (DBA). It is noted that N,N-dibutylamine is a functionalization catalyst even when it is used alone and also the complex [Zn(acac)2.H2O] taken alone. However, they are effective for only 2 hours. Comparative 3a), [Zn(acac)2.H2O](92 mg) followed by 243 μl of DBA, according to patent application US 2008/0 207 938, shows that the result obtained as curing catalyst in the presence of atmospheric moisture (4 days) is different from the two catalysts according to the invention [Zn(acac)2(DBA)2] and [Zn(acac)2(DBA)2].
