Step 3: Preparation of (S)-7-amino-5-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-3-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one
25 mg of (S)-7-amino-5-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-3-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one was prepared as a white solid by using 52 mg (0.09 mmol) of (S)-7-amino-5-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one prepared in step 2 according to the same manner as described in step 8 of Example 1 (0.05 mmol, yield: 60%).
