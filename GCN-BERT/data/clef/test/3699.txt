Example 11
Acetal 1l:
A 2-dram vial with a PTFE-lined cap was charged with 3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenylmethanol (81, 91.6 mg, 0.603 mmol) and benzoate S1 (230 mg, 0.790 mmol). These were dissolved in DCE (2.00 mL), and TFA (4.5 μL, 0.0608 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was heated to 80° C. and stirred for 15.5 h. After cooling to room temperature, K2CO3 (166 mg, 1.20 mmol) and MeOH (2.00 mL) were added, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 23° C. for 24 h. The mixture was then filtered through a short pad of silica gel, eluting with EtOAc (50.0 mL), and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (3:1:1 hexanes/EtOAc/CH2Cl2 eluent) to afford acetal 11 (180 mg, 93% yield, Rf=0.19 in 3:1 hexanes/EtOAc) as a light yellow oil.
