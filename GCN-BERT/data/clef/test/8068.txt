(E)-3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(3-ethyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3 -methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylic acid
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(3-ethyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3 ,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 19b (210 mg, 0.41 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of methanol, then 1 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide solution was added. After stirring for 12 hours, the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and hydrochloric acid was added dropwise to adjust the pH to 3. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by high performance liquid chromatography to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(3-ethyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3 -methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylic acid 19 (20 mg, yield 10%) as a yellow solid.
