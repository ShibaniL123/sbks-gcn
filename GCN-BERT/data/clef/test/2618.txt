TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a novel derivative of a cyclic compound, and more particularly, to a topical skin treatment agent for external application, in particular, a topical treatment agent composition for external application to the skin with excellent whitening effects. BACKGROUND ART Melanogenesis is a result of a process wherein generation of melanin is increased by a protective mechanism in melanocytes resulting from various forms of stimulation such as UV light, which in turn, causes a large amount of the melanin generated thereby to be transited to tokeratinocytes, and then accumulated in an epidermal layer of skin. Although melanin functions to protect the skin, hyper-pigmentation of the skin may cause liver spots, freckles, melanogenesis after dermal inflammation, senile pigment spots, or the like, hence incurring not only cosmetic inconveniences but also negative mental effects and, in turn, discomfort in the social life of a person suffering from the above problem. It is known that the process of melanin generation is generally performed by an enzyme called tyrosinase acting on tyrosine, which is one type of amino acid, to convert it into dopa and then dopaquinone, which in turn, undergoes non-enzymatic oxidation. It is considered that such a generated melanin may be abnormally deposited in the skin so as to cause liver spots, age spots, or the like. In order to alleviate, prevent and/or treat pigmentation, freckles and/or spots, etc., some substances for inhibiting the generation of melanin, for example, hydroquinone, arbutin, vitamin C and derivatives thereof have been developed and whitening cosmetics containing the same are also known to the public. Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2005-0509848 discloses a whitening cosmetic containing keratone derivatives separated from Anthrisci radix, and Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2005-0479741 discloses a whitening cosmetic containing glucose acylated derivatives. Among these, although hydroquinone is recognized to have some beneficial effects, its use is often limited due to sensitizing properties. Also, ascorbic acid is apt to be oxidized and a cosmetic combined with the same may cause problems such as discoloration or a change in scent. And, in general, since plant extract-derived substances involve considerable differences in efficacies depending on the origins of the plants, it is difficult to maintain uniformity of products. Further, glucose acylated derivatives have a drawback of very low synthesis efficiency. Therefore, as a result of continuous studies to develop a material capable of inhibiting melanin generation, the present inventors have synthesized novel cyclic compound derivatives and found that these derivatives exhibit excellent whitening effects, thereby completing the present invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a skin whitening composition that is easily synthesized and exhibits excellent effects of inhibiting melanin generation with no adverse effect on the skin, so as to provide superior skin pigmentation inhibitory effects. Means for Solving the Problems In order to accomplish the above objects, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a derivative of a polyhydroxy cyclic compound represented by Formula I below or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, including: wherein is derived from an aromatic cyclic compound, Cn, Cn+1 and Cn+2 are three neighboring carbon atoms present in the aromatic cyclic compound, wherein n is a positive integer, R1 and R2 are each a saturated or unsaturated straight or branched alkyl or acyl group having 3 to 12 carbon atoms, and R3, R4, R5 and R6 are each independently at least one substituent selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxy, acyloxy, acyloxymethyl, oxo, hydroxy, vinyl, nitrile, carboxaldehyde, carbonitrile and aldehyde. Effects of the Invention The compound according to the present invention may be easily synthesized and exhibit effects of inhibiting melanin generation and pigmentation with no adverse effect on the skin, therefore, a composition including the above compound can be used as a skin whitening composition.

Cancer Res., 40, pp. 3345-3350, 1980). After treating the compounds to have final concentrations of 5 μl/ml and 20 μl/ml, respectively, each of these compounds was added to a culture medium containing B-16 melanoma cells and cultured for 3 days. Then, these cells were treated using trypsin, separated from a culture vessel and centrifuged, then, melanin was extracted from the cells. Melanin was dissolved by adding 1 ml of 1N sodium hydroxide solution to the extract and subjected to measurement of absorbance at 475 nm, and an amount of the generated melanin was expressed by an absorbance per unit number of cells (106 cells) (this procedure was repeated three times). An amount of the generated melanin relative to control was calculated as an inhibition rate (%), and results thereof are shown in Table 1 below.

Although hydroquinone has strong effects of inhibiting melanin generation at a low concentration, it cannot undergo experiments at 1 μg/ml or more due to serious cytotoxicity. On the other hand, the above compounds do not exhibit cytotoxicity even at a concentration of 20 μg/ml to thus have more excellent melanin generation inhibitory effects than the hydroquinone.

First, 80 healthy panels were selected. An aluminum foil having two lanes of holes, wherein each hole has a diameter of 7 mm and each lane includes seven (7) holes formed therein, was attached to both forearms of every panel. Then, using an artificial solar radiation device (ORIEL solar simulator 1000 W), light with a radiation intensity of about 60 mJ/cm2 was emitted at a distance of 10 cm apart from the arm. Before light emission, an irradiating portion was sufficiently washed. From 3 days before the light emission up to 8 weeks after the light emission, formulations 1 to 6 and comparative formulations 1 to 6 were applied in pairs to the same lane of holes twice per day. Pack products of the formulation 6 and comparative formulation 6 were removed when passing 15 minutes after application. The panels were divided into four (4) groups each of which having 20 persons, and subjected to experiments. Whitening effects were determined by visibly monitoring a degree of pigmentation of the formulations and comparative formulations in each of the panels. Compared to the comparative formulations, extents of pigmentation inhibition of the inventive formulations ware evaluated in three levels including noticeable efficiency, efficiency, and inefficiency, and results of such evaluation are shown in Table 8 below.
