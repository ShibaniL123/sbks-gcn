Example 18. Preparation of Comparative PAG, CPAG-1, Adapted from the Procedure of JP2002236358A
A 100 mL flask was charged with (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (3.22 g, 10.0 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and CH3CN (25 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes at room temperature. The CH3CN (25 mL) solution of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (3.00 g, 20.0 mmol, 2.0 eq.) and H2O (0.36 g, 20.0 mmol, 2.0 eq.) was added drop-wise to the mixture over 5 minutes and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature. Acetophenone (1.20 g, 10.0 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added to the mixture and the mixture was stirred for 2.5 hours at room temperature. The mixture was then concentrated in an evaporator. The residue was extracted with hexane (50 mL) twice and the hexane layers were combined followed by removing the hexane in an evaporator. The crude product was purified by recrystallization (hexane, 35° C. to 0° C.) to obtain the target compound as a white solid (0.113 g, 4.2% yield).
