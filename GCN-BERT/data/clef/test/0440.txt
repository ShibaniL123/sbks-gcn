TITLE Emulsifiable concentrate comprising a dinitroaniline compound BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an emulsifiable concentrate comprising an active ingredient being a dinitroaniline compound, preferably selected from the group consisting of pendimethalin, trifluralin, benfluralin, butralin, dinitramine, ethalfluralin, fluazinam, fluchloralin, flumetralin, oryzalin, prodiamine and mixtures thereof. The emulsifiable concentrate of the invention prevents, and even avoids, especially crystallization at low temperature when the concentration of the active ingredient is high. Emulsifiable concentrates (EC) are liquid compositions comprising an active ingredient in a liquid form, for example an active ingredient having a biological effect on plants (agricultural active). Emulsifiable concentrates usually have a single phase. Emulsifiable concentrates are to be mixed with water, in order to obtain a direct emulsion having a liquid hydrophobic phase comprising the active ingredient dispersed in water. For example a farmer would mix an emulsifiable concentrate comprising a hydrophobic agricultural active with water and readily obtain an emulsion to be applied onto a field. This procedure, where the farmer prepares from a concentrated composition the final product to be applied onto a field, is usually referred to as a “tank mix” procedure. An emulsifiable concentrate is also referred to as a “tank mix” composition. Emulsifiable concentrates comprising an active ingredient being a dinitroaniline compound are known. However it is difficult to formulate these active agents at relatively high concentrations, especially at concentrations higher than 480 g/L, with sufficient stability. In particular, from a certain concentration, the formulation start to crystallize, in particular at low temperature, especially in a cold test (0°C by 7 days) and/or during dilution and/or during storage of the dilute composition at high temperature. The crystals may have harmful effects, especially blocking the filters of the devices used for spreading the dilute composition, blocking the spraying devices, reducing the overall activity (especially bioefficacy) of the formulation, creating unnecessary problems of waste-management procedures for removing the crystals, and/or causing poor distribution of the active product on the agricultural field. Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field. It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.

The solvent compositions of the invention make it possible to prepare stable emulsifiable concentrates comprising dinitroaniline compounds, especially at high levels. A preferred embodiment of the invention relates to an emulsifiable concentrate comprising at least: a) an active ingredient being a dinitroaniline compound, preferably selected from the group consisting of pendimethalin, trifluralin, benfluralin, butralin, dinitramine, ethalfluralin, fluazinam, fluchloralin, flumetralin, oryzalin, prodiamine and mixtures thereof, b) an emulsifier or an emulsifier mixture, and c) a solvent mixture, with said solvent mixture being selected from the solvent compositions (S1) and (S2) defined above. An embodiment of the invention also relates to a method for preparing an emulsion of an active ingredient being a dinitroaniline compound, preferably selected from the group consisting of pendimethalin, trifluralin, benfluralin, butralin, dinitramine, ethalfluralin, fluazinam, fluchloralin, flumetralin, oryzalin, prodiamine and mixtures thereof, in water, comprising the step of mixing 1 part by volume of the emulsifiable concentrate of the invention, with at least 10 parts by volume of water, and up to 1000 parts by volume of water. For example the volume ratio between the emulsifiable concentrate and water may range from 0.1 to 20% ν/ν, preferably from 1 to 5% ν/ν. Another embodiment of the invention also relates to an emulsion comprising: a) an active ingredient being a dinitroaniline compound, preferably selected from the group consisting of pendimethalin, trifluralin, benfluralin, butralin, dinitramine, ethalfluralin, fluazinam, fluchloralin, flumetralin, oryzalin, prodiamine and mixtures thereof, b) an emulsifier or a mixture of emulsifiers, c) a solvent mixture, with said solvent mixture being selected from the solvent - water. The emulsifiable concentrates, the emulsions formed therefrom, and the emulsions according to the invention have a good biological activity (selective herbicidal activity for destroying most annual grasses and many annual broad-level weeds) and/or a low toxicity. The solvent compositions and/or emulsifier systems and/or emulsifiable concentrates and/or emulsions according to the invention are stable, even at low temperature. The solvent compositions and/or emulsifier systems and/or emulsifiable concentrates and/or emulsions according to the invention prevent, or even avoid, crystallization problems at low temperature and/or at high level of actives, in the solvent composition or emulsifiable concentrate itself or when mixing with water. For example it can prevent, or even avoid, crystallization problems at 0°C, or even at -5°C, by 24 hours, for example 48 hours, for example 72 hours, or even by 7 days, and concentrations of up to 435 g/l, especially of up to 480 g/l, for example of up to 520 g/L, for example of up to 550 g/L, for example of up to 600 g/L prior to mixing with water. Unexpectedly, and as illustrated in the Examples, it can also promote redissolution of the crystal formed in the solvent composition or emulsifiable concentrate itself or when mixing with water. In a preferred embodiment, the solvent compositions and/or emulsifier systems and/or emulsifiable concentrates and/or emulsions according to the invention do not give rise to crystalline precipitates for at least 48 hours upon storage at 0°C, and preferably do not give rise to crystalline precipitates for at least 72 hours and most preferably at least 7 days. The ability to store the composition of the invention for a sustained period of time is beneficial, as it allows the user to purchase a concentrated composition and store the composition until it is desired for use without fear of loss of efficacy over time. As a result wastage of the composition and costs associated with the disposal of unused dinitroaniline compound is minimized. Furthermore, as the dinitroaniline-based composition of the invention forms stable compositions, any risk associated with the clogging of equipment or incorrect dosage of the dinitroaniline compound may be avoided. The ability of the composition to remain stable at cold ambient temperature is advantageous for use in countries that experience cold climates, such as in many parts of Europe, Asia and North America. As the compositions of the invention resist the formation of crystallization particles even at cold storage, the useful lifetime of the composition is greatly increased in such countries. According to one embodiment, the solvent compositions and/or emulsifier systems and/or emulsifiable concentrates and/or emulsions according to the invention are ηοηflammable. The solvent compositions and/or emulsifier systems and/or emulsifiable concentrates and/or emulsions according to the invention may especially have a flash point greater than 60°C. Advantageously solvent compositions and/or emulsifier systems and/or emulsifiable concentrates and/or emulsions according to the invention having a flash point greater than 60°C make it possible to address at least some of the issues discussed previously (i.e. ability to dissolve large amounts of dinitroaniline compounds and/or ability to prevent, and even to avoid, crystallization problems of dinitroaniline compounds, even under rigorous conditions and/or ability to promote crystal redissolution while keeping an acceptable efficacy or equivalent efficacy or even improving efficacy) while at the same time reducing the amount of inconveniences in terms of safety, transport, storage and manipulation by the manufacturer and end user.

Preparation process Standard processes for preparing emulsifiable concentrates or solvent mixtures may be used. The process may be performed by simple mixing of the constituents. Regarding the preparation of the solvent mixture of the invention, it is especially possible to introduce the various solvents separately. A solvent mixture prepared beforehand, typically the solvent composition, may also be introduced. The solvent composition may be prepared by simple mixing of the solvents. Regarding the emulsifiable concentrate of the invention, it may be prepared by admixing all of the ingredients in the solvent mixture. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the emulsifiable concentrate of the invention are prepared by a method comprising the following steps: (a) admixing the active ingredient, for example trifluralin in a molten form into the solvent mixture, (b) adding the emulsifier(s), (c) optionally allowing cooling, and (d) filtering before packaging the emulsifiable concentrate. In one preferred embodiment, the emulsifiable concentrate of the invention may be prepared by a method comprising the steps of: (a) admixing the active ingredient, for example trifluralin in a molten form into the solvent mixture, (b) adding the emulsifier(s), (c) allowing cooling, and to stand for at least 1 hour, for example at least 2 hours, for example at least 4 hours, and (d) filtering before packaging the emulsifiable concentrate. The emulsifiable concentrate compositions of the present invention are diluted with water and applied as dilute, aqueous emulsions to the locus where weed control is desired. Typical dilution rates are in the range of about 1 part by volume of concentrate per at least 10 parts, preferably at least 15 parts, up to 500 parts, for example 19 or 20 parts. While the compositions of this invention are effective for controlling weeds when employed alone, they may also be used in conjunction with or in combination with other biological chemicals, including other herbicides. Performance The emulsifiable concentrate according the invention is preferably such that the active ingredient, for example trifluralin, does not crystallize at 0°C by 24 hours, for example by 48 hours, for example by 72 hours, even by 7 days, and preferably at -5°C by 24 hours, for example by 48 hours, for example by 72 hours, even by 7 days, at a concentration of active ingredient of at least 480 g/l, especially of at least 500 g/l, for example of at least 520 g/L, for example of at least 550 g/L, for example of at least 600 g/L or even of more than 600 g/L, and/or such that it does not crystallize at these temperatures upon dilution. Crystallization tests can be performed on the emulsifiable concentrate by seeding and observing (eye observation). Crystallization upon dilution tests can be performed on the emulsifiable concentrate by observing (eye observation or web 45 pm sieve residue). Use of the compositions of the invention The emulsifiable concentrates, the emulsions formed therefrom, and the emulsions according to the invention are plant-protection formulations. The emulsifiable concentrate of the invention is intended to be spread on a cultivated field or a field to be cultivated, for example a field of soybean, usually after diluting in water, to obtain a dilute composition. The dilution is generally performed by the farmer, directly in a tank (tank mix), for example in the tank of a device for spreading the composition. It is not excluded for the farmer to add other plant-protection products, for example fungicides, herbicides, pesticides, insecticides or fertilizers. Thus, the formulation may be used to prepare a composition diluted in water of the active plant-protection product, by mixing at least one part by weight of concentrated formulation with at least 10 parts and preferably less than 1000 parts of water. The dilution rates and the amounts to be applied on the field generally depend on the plant-protection product and on the desirable dose for treating the field; this may be determined by the farmer. Other details or advantages of the invention will emerge in the light of the examples that follow, which are given without any limiting nature. EXAMPLES Concrete but non-limiting examples of the invention are presented below. The following ingredients are used: - cyclohexyl acetate, - 2-ethylhexyl acetate, - acetophenone, - SOLVESSO® 200, from Exxon - RHODIASOLV® IRIS, from Rhodia - Trifluralin tech 96%, from Nufarm - SOPROPHOR® TSP/724 from Rhodia (ethoxylated and propoxylated tristyrylphenols), - RHODACAL® 60/BE-C from Rhodia (a 60% calcium dodecylbenzene sulfonate solution in ethylhexanol) - ANTAROX®461 Ρ from Rhodia (ethoxylated and propoxylated nonylphenols). Examples 1 and 2 The following solvent compositions in accordance with the invention were prepared (the contents are indicated as % by weight relative to the total weight of the solvent composition): EXAMPLE 1 2 SOLVENT COMPOSITION MIX 1 MIX 2 Cyclohexyl acetate 30% 40% 2-Ethylhexyl acetate 15% - Acetophenone 55% - SOLVESSO® 200 - 15% RHODIASOLV® IRIS 45% These two solvent compositions were able to solubilise up to 600g/l of trifluralin active at 0°C by 7 days. Moreover the flash points of these two solvent compositions are higher than 60°C. These two solvent compositions are thus additionally non flammable formulations. Examples 3 and 4: Trifluralin 550 q/L and 600q/L using MIX 1 The following emulsifiable concentrates were prepared according to the protocol indicated in the description (the contents are indicated as % by weight relative to the total weight of the solvent composition): EXAMPLE 3 4 Trifluralin 50.5% (=550 g/l ae) 54.6% (=600 g/l ae) SOLVENT COMPOSITION OF 40.7% 54.6% EXAMPLE 1 RHODACAL® 60/BE-C 4.8% 4.8% SOPROPHOR® TSP/724 4.0% 4.0% Examples 5 and 6: Trifluralin 550 q/L and 600q/L using MIX 2 The following emulsifiable concentrates were prepared according to the protocol indicated in the description (the contents are indicated as % by weight relative to the total weight of the solvent composition): EXAMPLE 5 6 Trifluralin 49.4% (=550g/l ae) 53.3% (=600g/l ae) SOLVENT COMPOSITION OF 41.9% 38.1% EXAMPLE 2 ANTAROX® 461 Ρ 2.2% 2.2% RHODACAL® 60/BE-C 3.0% 3.0% SOPROPHOR® TSP/724 3.5% 3.5% Example 7: performance Emulsion stability of Emulsifiable Concentrates (ECs) 3-6 were evaluated as per test described in CIPAC ΜΤ 36.3 The following tests are performed: - Visual observation at different temperatures: ambient temperature (21 °C) and for 24 hours in a warm temperature bath (set at 30°C) - The appearance of the emulsions are noted and fall out of active as sludge or sedimentation is investigated, through observation. Re-emulsification is also investigated by re-mixing the emulsions after 24 hours standing at 30°C and placing back in the warm bath a further hour before re-assessment. The ECs 3-6 of the invention all showed good bloom and good fine blue emulsion quality, with sludge/sedimentation after 24 hours at 30°C, from less than 0.01 ml for 550 g/l active to less than 0.7 ml for 600 g/l active, when freshly prepared or after 14 days stored at 54°C (accelerated storage). They all exhibited good re-emulsification properties after 24 hours. In comparison, Nufarm Triflur 480 g/L active EC gave good bloom with an adequate emulsion, resulting with 6 ml total sedimentation plus sludge, after 24 hours at 30°C. In practice, quality of the emulsion reflects the bio-efficacy of the formulation. Better quality and stable emulsion will give more efficacious results. Low temperature crystallisation The following tests are performed: - Visual observation after one week storage at 0°C (respectively at -5°C) - The formulation is placed for seven days at 0°C (respectively at -5°C), and the appearance of the formulation is noted and the possible presence of crystals is investigated (test CIPAC ΜΤ39) - Visual observation at 0°C (respectively at -5°C) with nucleation: a crystal of the active material (obtained from the dried up composition) is introduced into the formulation that has spent 7 days at 0°C (respectively at -5°C) for nucleation, and the formulation is placed at 0°C (respectively at -5°C) for a further 7 days. The appearance of the formulation is noted and the possible presence of crystals is investigated. The containers were 12 mL glass bottles filled to 10 mL with the composition to be tested. Crystallisation was assessed visually as a percentage in volume. The amount of crystallisation was assessed by its volume relative to the 10mL of composition. Key: NT = Nufarm Τriflur 480 g/IL ae Ex Visual observation at Visual observation at Visual observation at Visual observation at 0°C for 7 days 0°C for 7 days -5°C for 7 days -5°C for 7 days (without nucleous) (with nucleous) (without nucleous) (with nucleous) 3 No crystal No crystal No crystal No crystal 4 No crystal No crystal No crystal < 7 % crystals NT No crystal No crystal No crystal 25% crystals The solvent compositions and emulsifiers systems of the invention make it possible to obtain highly concentrated trifluralin emulsifiable concentrates able to dissolve large amounts of trifluralin and to avoid crystallisation problems under rigorous conditions. Further experiments were conducted on composition of Example 4, in which some crystals were formed after 7 days at -5 °C. This composition was allowed to reach ambient temperature (21 °C) without agitation. Unexpectedly, these crystals re-dissolved after 5 days at ambient temperature (21 °C), without any agitation. This illustrates that the solvent compositions and emulsifier systems of the invention make also it possible to promote crystal redissolution in high concentrated formulations. As a comparison, the same tests were performed on the product Nufarm Triflur 480 Selective Herbicide from Nufarm, which is a commercial Emulsifiable Concentrate containing 480 g/L of trifluralin (currently the market leader in Australia). No crystal were observed at 0°C or -5°C for 7 days without nucleous, or at 0°C for 7 days with nucleous of the dried up commercial product. At -5°C for 7 days with nucleous of the dried up commercial product, about 25% of crystals were observed (according to the same protocol as described above). The same further experiments were also conducted on this comparative formulation, i.e. it was allowed to reach room temperature (21 °C) without agitation. However crystals (about 3%) were still present after three weeks at ambient temperature (21 °C) without agitation. 1.
