Step 1
4-(5,5-Dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-2-yl)phenol (37)
To a stirred solution of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (5 g, 40.98 mmol) in benzene (50 mL) at room temperature were added neo-pentyl glycol (4.68 g, 45.08 mmol) and pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (0.5 g, 2.04 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 16 h under a Dean-Stark set-up. The reaction mass was distilled under reduced pressure. The resulting crude compound was dissolved in ethyl acetate (100 mL), the organic layers was washed with water (3Ã—30 mL), dried over Na2SO4, concentrated under reduced pressure to get 4-(5,5-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-2-yl)phenol (6 g, yield: 70.42%, LC/MS: 62%) as a brown solid.
