Propylene random copolymer composition for pipe applications' The present invention relates to nucleated propylene random copolymer compositions with an improved balance of properties in regard of mechanical properties including impact properties and processing properties which are suitable for pipe applications. Polypropylene materials are frequently used for various pipe and pipe fitting applications, such as fluid transport, e.g. water or natural gas, during which the fluid is pressurized and/or heated. In particular, polypropylene materials are used in applications for plumbing and heating, such as in-house hot and cold water pressure pipes and fittings, floor and wall heating systems and radiator connections. Thereby, propylene random copolymers are especially suitable for pressure pipe applications for hot water and industrial pipes as the random copolymers have inter alia good impact performance, stiffness, creep resistance and slow crack properties and long term pressure resistance. The expression “pressure pipe” used herein refers to a pipe which, when used, is subjected to a positive pressure, that is the pressure inside the pipe being higher than the pressure outside the pipe. It is well known that increasing one of the impact or stiffness properties sacrifices the other. Moreover, propylene random copolymers based pipes for hot and cold water pressure applications are often coloured e.g. Green, Grey, Blue, and White etc. Different pigments have different nucleation effect on propylene random copolymers and variation in intensity of the effect from one colour to another will result in dimensional variations because differences in shrinkage associated with the nucleation. Naturally, processability like extrusion output rate during pipe production and shorter cycle time during injection moulding of fittings should be industrially feasible, as well as the surface quality of the final pipe and/or fitting. As to alpha nucleated polypropylene pipes, W00068315 (ΕΡ1183307) of Borealis discloses nucleated homo polymer and heterophasic copolymer of propylene and mentions pipe as one of the numerous options of end applications. Said solution is focused on moulding applications and the examples are for homo polypropylene and heterophasic polypropylene with high melt flow rate which is not suitable for pipe applications. WO 99/24479 of Borealis discloses nucleated propylene polymer, however examples disclose homo polymers of propylene and heterophasic copolymers of propylene. The heterophasic copolymers of propylene are stated to be “stiff” (examples 9 and 10, e.g. flexural modulus of around 1500 and 1600 MPa), whereby they are suitable for sewage pipe applications. The present invention relates to a polypropylene composition suitable for pipe applications comprising a multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) with at least one comonomer selected from alpha-olefins with 2 or 4 to 8 carbon atoms and a nucleating agent (Β), wherein the polypropylene composition has a Charpy Notched Impact Strength at 23°C of at least 30 kJ/m2, determined according to ISO 179/1℮Α:2000 using notched injection moulded specimens. The present invention is further characterized in that the multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) of the polypropylene composition of the invention does not contain an elastomeric phase dispersed therein. It has surprisingly been found that the polypropylene composition according to the present invention not only shows good mechanical properties in view of the flexural modulus, but also very good impact properties, as can be seen from the Charpy Notched Impact Strength at room temperature and preferably also at cold temperatures. More preferably the present multimodal polypropylene composition shows advantageously feasible creep resistance as can be seen from tensile stress. Further preferably, the present multimodal polypropylene composition has advantageous pressure resistance required for pressure pipe applications. The present multimodal polypropylene composition has preferably also an advantageous processing behavior in terms of pipe extrusion and/or cycle time of molded fittings. The obtained final pipe or fitting has a uniform shrinkage behavior and a good surface quality. Pressure pipe for hot and cold water applications has a well-known meaning in the field of polypropylene pipe applications and implies for a skilled person generally accepted property requirements for the pipe to be usable in such applications. A propylene random copolymer denotes a copolymer of propylene monomer units and comonomer units in which the comonomer units are randomly distributed in the polymeric chain. Thereby, a propylene random copolymer includes a fraction, which is insoluble in xylene - xylene cold insoluble (XCU) fraction, in an amount of at least 70 wt%, more preferably of at least 80 wt%, still more preferably of at least 85 wt% and most preferably of at least 90 wt%, based on the total amount of the propylene random copolymer. Accordingly, the random copolymer does not contain an elastomeric polymer phase dispersed therein. As known for skilled person, random copolymer is different from heterophasic polypropylene which is a propylene copolymer comprising a propylene homo or random copolymer matrix component (1) and an elastomeric copolymer component (2) of propylene with one or more of ethylene and C4-C8 alpha-olefin copolymers, wherein the elastomeric (amorphous) copolymer component (2) is dispersed in said propylene homo or random copolymer matrix polymer (1). Usually, a propylene polymer comprising at least two propylene polymer fractions (components), which have been produced under different polymerisation conditions resulting in different (weight average) molecular weights and/or different comonomer contents for the fractions, preferably produced by polymerizing in multiple polymerization stages with different polymerization conditions, is referred to as “multimodal”. The prefix “multi” relates to the number of different polymer fractions the propylene polymer is consisting of. As an example of multimodal polypropylene, a propylene polymer consisting of two fractions only is called “bimodal”, whereas a propylene polymer consisting of three fractions only is called “trimodal”. Thereby the term “different” means that the propylene polymer fractions differ from each other in at least one property, preferably in the weight average molecular weight or comonomer content or both, more preferably at least in the weight average molecular weight. The form of the molecular weight distribution curve, i.e. the appearance of the graph of the polymer weight fraction as function of its molecular weight, of such a multimodal propylene polymer is at least distinctly broadened in comparison with the curves for the individual fractions. The propylene random copolymer used in the present invention is a multimodal propylene random copolymer, more preferably a bimodal propylene random copolymer. Preferably, the multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) consists of the two propylene copolymer fractions with the proviso that at least one of the two fractions, preferably both fractions are propylene random copolymer fractions. A propylene homopolymer thereby denotes a polymer consisting essentially of propylene monomer units. Due to the requirements of largescale polymerization it may be possible that the propylene homopolymer includes minor amounts of comonomer units, which usually is below 0.1 mol%, preferably below 0.05 mol%, most preferably below 0.01 mol% of the propylene homopolymer. A nucleating agent denotes herein a compound or composition which is added on purpose to increase the crystallization rate within the solid polymer and lead to an increased degree of crystallinity (and often to a smaller crystal size) of the solid polymer. The multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) used in the polypropylene composition of the invention comprises at least one comonomer selected from alpha-olefins with 2 or 4 to 8 carbon atoms. The multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) may comprise only one type of comonomers or two or more types of comonomers. The comonomers of said multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) are preferably selected from C2 and C4 to C& alpha-olefins. A particular preferred comonomer is ethylene. Especially suitable for the polypropylene composition of the present invention is a multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) which is a propylene random copolymer with ethylene comonomer. It is preferred that the propylene random copolymer (A), which is preferably the propylene random copolymer with ethylene comonomer, comprises at least a propylene random copolymer having a low molecular weight (low molecular weight (LMW) fraction) and a propylene random copolymer having a high molecular weight (high molecular weight (HMW) fraction). Thereby, the LMW fraction has a lower weight average molecular weight than the HMW fraction. It is well known that melt flow rate (MFR) of a polymer is an indication of the weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the polymer, the higher the MFR the lower the Mw of the polymer and, respectively, the lower the MFR the higher the Mw of the polymer. Accordingly, the MFR of the low molecular weight fraction is higher than the MFR of the high molecular weight fraction. Preferably both the low molecular weight fraction and the high molecular weight fraction are propylene random copolymer fractions which may have essentially the same or different comonomer content. It is thereby preferred that the high molecular weight fraction has an equal to higher, preferably higher, comonomer content compared to the low molecular weight fraction. The comonomer content of the high molecular weight fraction is usually in the range of 1.0 to 17.0 mol%, preferably 1.5 to 10.0 mol%, more preferably 3.5 to 8.5 mol%, still more preferably 5.0 to 8.0 mol, most preferably 6.0 to 7.5 mol%, based on the total content of monomeric units in the high molecular weight fraction. The comonomer content of the low molecular weight fraction is usually in the range of 0.1 to 11.0 mol%, preferably 1.5 to 8.5 wt%, more preferably 3.5 to 7.5 mol%, most preferably 5.0 to 6.5 mol%, based on the total content of monomeric units in the low molecular weight fraction. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) comprises at least a low molecular weight fraction (LMW fraction) and a high molecular weight fraction (HMW fraction), wherein the high molecular weight fraction (HMW fraction) has higher comonomer, preferably ethylene comonomer, content, than the low molecular weight fraction (LMW fraction). In this preferred embodiment the comonomer, preferably ethylene comonomer content of HMW fraction, is within the preferred ranges as defined above. The comonomer content of the multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) is usually in the range of 0.1 to 14 mol%, preferably 1.5 to 10.0 mol%, more preferably 3.5 to 8.5 mol%, still more preferably 4.0 to 7.0 mol%, most preferably 4.5 to 6.5 mol%, based on the total content of monomeric units in the multimodal propylene random copolymer (A). The low molecular weight fraction and the high molecular weight fraction may include the same type of comonomer or different types of comonomers. It is thereby preferred that both fractions include the same type of comonomer. The low molecular weight fraction is preferably present in the propylene random copolymer in an amount of 35 to 55 wt%, more preferably in an amount of 40 to 50 wt% and most preferably in an amount of 40 to 47 wt%, based on the total amount of the propylene random copolymer (100wt%), preferably, and the high molecular weight fraction is preferably present in the propylene random copolymer in an amount of 65 to 45 wt%, more preferably in an amount of 60 to 50 wt% and most preferably in an amount of 60 to 53 wt%, based on the total amount of the propylene random copolymer (100wt%). The multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) preferably has a density of 890 to 910, preferably 895 to 905 kg/m3. It is preferred that the propylene random copolymer (A) consists of the propylene random copolymer having a low molecular weight (low molecular weight (LMW) fraction), the propylene random copolymer having a high molecular weight (high molecular weight (HMW) fraction), the nucleating agent (Β) and optional further additives, as defined above or below. The multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) may further comprise a prepolymer fraction. In case of the presence of a prepolymer fraction, said fraction is calculated to the amount (wt%) of the low molecular weight fraction or high molecular weight fraction, preferably to the amount of high molecular weight fraction. The prepolymer fraction can be propylene homopolymer or copolymer. It is especially preferred that polypropylene composition according to the invention consists of the propylene random copolymer (A), the nucleating agent (Β) and optional further additives, as defined above or below. Accordingly, the amount of the multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) is preferably 90.0 to 99.75 wt%, more preferably of 95.0 to 99.75 wt% and even more preferably of 96.5 to 99.75 wt%, based on the total weight of the polypropylene composition (100 wt%).

It is especially preferred that the process according to the present invention includes the following process steps: (aa) polymerising a vinyl compound of the formula (I) as defined above or below, preferably vinyl cyclohexane (VCH), in the presence of a catalyst system comprising the solid catalyst component (I) to obtain a modified catalyst system which is the reaction mixture comprising the solid catalyst component (I) and the produced polymer of the vinyl compound of formula (I), preferably, and wherein, the weight ratio (g) of the polymer of the vinyl compound of the formula (I) to the solid catalyst component (I) is up to 5 (5:1), preferably up to 3 (3:1) most preferably is from 0.5 (1:2) to 2 (2:1), and the obtained modified catalyst system is fed to polymerisation step (a) of the multistage process for producing the multimodal propylene copolymer (A). The process of the invention is described in details below: Accordingly, conventional polymerization techniques, e.g. gas phase, solution phase, slurry or bulk polymerization can be used. In general, a combination of slurry (or bulk) and at least one gas phase reactor is often preferred for the polymerisation of the multimodal propylene random copolymer (A). It is further preferred that the reactor order is slurry (or bulk) then one or more gas phase reactors. In case of propylene polymerisation for slurry reactors, the reaction temperature will generally be in the range 60 to 110°C, e.g. 60 to 85 °C, the reactor pressure will generally be in the range 5 to 80 bar, e.g. 20 to 60 bar, and the residence time will generally be in the range 0.1 to 5 hours, e.g. 0.3 to 2 hours. The monomer is usually used as reaction medium. For gas phase reactors, the reaction temperature used will generally be in the range 60 to 115 °C, e.g. 70 to 110 °C, the reactor pressure will generally be in the range 10 to 25 bar, and the residence time will generally be 0.5 to 8 hours, e.g. 0.5 to 4 hours. The gas used will be the monomer optionally as mixture with a non-reactive gas such as nitrogen or propane. In addition to actual polymerisation steps and reactors, the process can contain any additional polymerisation steps, like prepolymerisation step, and any further after reactor handling steps as known in the art. Preferably the multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) is produced in a sequential polymerization process comprising at least two polymerization zones operating at different conditions to produce the multimodal propylene random copolymer (A). The polymerization zones may operate in slurry, solution, or gas phase conditions or their combinations. Suitable processes are disclosed, among others, in WO-A-98/58975, WO-A-98/58976, EP-A-887380 and WO-A-98/58977. In a preferred embodiment, the optional prepolymerization is conducted in a continuous manner as bulk slurry polymerization in liquid propylene, i.e. the liquid phase mainly comprises propylene, with minor amount of other reactants and optionally inert components dissolved therein. Preferably the prepolymerization is conducted in a continuous stirred tank reactor or a loop reactor. The prepolymerization reaction is typically conducted at a temperature of 0 to 60 °C, preferably from 10 to 50 °C, and more preferably from 20 to 45 °C. The pressure in the prepolymerization reactor is not critical but must be sufficiently high to maintain the reaction mixture in liquid phase. Thus, the pressure may be from 20 to 100 bar, for example 30 to 70 bar. The reaction conditions are well known in the art as disclosed, among others, in GB 1580635. The polymerization in the first polymerization zone may be conducted in slurry. Then the polymer particles formed in the polymerization, together with the catalyst fragmented and dispersed within the particles, are suspended in the fluid hydrocarbon. The slurry is agitated to enable the transfer of reactants from the fluid into the particles. Slurry polymerization is preferably a so called bulk polymerization. By “bulk polymerization” is meant a process where the polymerization is conducted in a liquid monomer essentially in the absence of an inert diluent. The temperature in the slurry polymerization is typically from 50 to 110 °C, preferably from 60 to 100 °C and in particular from 60 to 80 °C. The pressure is from 1 to 150 bar, preferably from 10 to 100 bar, most preferably from 30 to 65 bar. In some cases it may be preferred to conduct the polymerization at a temperature which is higher than the critical temperature of the fluid mixture constituting the reaction phase and at a pressure which is higher than the critical pressure of said fluid mixture. Such reaction conditions are often referred to as “supercritical conditions”. The phrase “supercritical fluid” is used to denote a fluid or fluid mixture at a temperature and pressure exceeding the critical temperature and pressure of said fluid or fluid mixture. The slurry polymerization may be conducted in any known reactor used for slurry polymerization. Such reactors include a continuous stirred tank reactor and a loop reactor. It is especially preferred to conduct the polymerization in loop reactor. In such reactors the slurry is circulated with a high velocity along a closed pipe by using a circulation pump. Loop reactors are generally known in the art and examples are given, for instance, in US 4,582,816, US 3,405,109, US 3,324,093, EP-A-479186 and US 5,391,654. The polymerization in gas phase may be conducted in a fluidized bed reactor, in a fast fluidized bed reactor or in a settled bed reactor or in any combination of these. When a combination of reactors is used then the polymer is transferred from one polymerization reactor to another. Furthermore, a part or whole of the polymer from a polymerization stage may be returned into a prior polymerization stage. Typically the fluidized bed polymerization reactor is operated at a temperature within the range of from 50 to 100 °C, preferably from 70 to 90 °C. The pressure is suitably from 10 to 40 bar, preferably from 10 to 30 bar. The adjustment of the melt flow rate during the polymerisation process of multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) is carried out in a conventional manner by using e.g. a chain termination agent (known also e.g. as molecular weight of MFR controlling agent), typically hydrogen. The preferred multistage process is carried out in a reactor system comprising at least a loop reactor, and optionally one, two or more gas phase reactors, in said order. Said reactor system and process is known as Borstar® Technology. Especially preferred for the polymerization of the multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) is a reactor assembly consisting of a loop reactor followed by a gas phase reactor. The loop reactor is thereby optionally preceded by a prepolymerization reactor which may also be a slurry reactor. Accordingly, in the polymerization stage of gas phase reactor preferably a copolymer mixture comprising the copolymer produced in loop reactor and a copolymer produced in the gas phase reactor is formed. The copolymer mixture is formed by introducing the particles of the copolymer of the loop reactor, containing active catalyst dispersed therein, together with additional propylene and comonomer, into the polymerization in gasphase reactor. This causes the copolymer produced in gas phase reactor to form on the particles containing the copolymer of the loop reactor. Said first propylene random copolymer preferably reflects the propylene random copolymer having a high molecular weight (HMW) fraction of the propylene random copolymer (A) and said second propylene random copolymer preferably reflects the low molecular weight (LMW) fraction of the propylene random copolymer (A) as defined above. Thus, copolymer mixture comprising the first propylene random copolymer and a second propylene random copolymer preferably reflects a mixture of the high molecular weight (HMW) fraction and the low molecular weight (LMW) fraction of the propylene random copolymer (A) as defined above. The amount of any prepolymer fraction thereby preferably adds to the amount of the high molecular weight fraction. As to catalyst, the multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) can be produced by polymerisation in the presence of any conventional coordination catalyst system including Ziegler-Natta, chromium and single site (like metallocene catalyst), preferably in the presence of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system. Such Ziegler-Natta catalyst system typically comprises a solid catalyst component, preferably a solid transition metal component, and a cocatalyst, and optionally an external donor. The solid catalyst component comprises most preferably a magnesium halide, a titanium halide and an internal electron donor. Such catalysts are well known in the art. It is preferred that the nucleating agent (Β) is introduced to the multimodal propylene random copolymer (A) during the polymerisation process of the propylene random copolymer (A). More preferably the nucleating agent (Β) is introduced together with the solid Ziegler-Natta catalyst system for the polymerisation of the multimodal propylene random copolymer (A).

Suitable electron donors are, among others, esters of carboxylic acids, like phthalates, citraconates, and succinates. Also oxygen- or nitrogencontaining silicon compounds may be used. Examples of suitable compounds are shown in WO 92/19659, WO 92/19653, WO 92/19658, US 4,347,160, US 4,382,019, US 4,435,550, US 4,465,782, US 4,473,660, US 4,530,912 and US 4,560,671. Moreover, said solid catalyst components are preferably used in combination with well known external electron donors, including without limiting to, ethers, ketones, amines, alcohols, phenols, phosphines and silanes, for example organosilane compounds containing Si-OCOR, Si-OR, or Si-NR2 bonds, having silicon as the central atom, and R is an alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, arylalkyl or cycloalkyl with 1-20 carbon atoms; and well known cocatalysts, which preferably comprise an aluminium alkyl compound as known in the art, to polymerise the propylene random copolymer (A).

Such extruders are manufactured, for instance, by Coperion (Werner & Pfleiderer) and Japan Steel Works. Article of the invention: Further, the present invention' relates to an article comprising the multimodal polypropylene composition according to the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, the article is selected from an extruded article, preferably a pipe application, or a moulded article, preferably an injection moulded or blow moulded article, application more preferably a fitting for pipe applications, comprising the multimodal polypropylene composition of the invention. The pipe and fitting produced from the polypropylene composition according to the invention preferably has good mechanical properties as described above and shown below in experimental part. Thus, the pipe according to the invention preferably qualifies as pressure pipe. Pipe of the invention can be a monolayer pipe, wherein the pipe layer comprises, preferably consists of, the multimodal polypropylene composition of the invention, or -a multilayer pipe, wherein at least one layer comprises, preferably consists of, the multimodal polypropylene composition of the invention. The preferred pipe of the invention has at least one layer comprising, preferably consisting of, the multimodal polypropylene composition of the invention. Preferred pipe is a pressure pipe, more preferably a pressure pipe for hot and cold water applications. Fitting of the invention preferably consists of the multimodal polypropylene composition of the invention. Production of pipe of the invention: Pipes can be produced from the multimodal polypropylene composition according to the present invention according to the methods known in the art. Thus, according to one preferred method the multimodal polypropylene composition is extruded through an annular die to a desired internal diameter, after which the multimodal polypropylene composition is cooled. The pipe extruder preferably operates at a relatively low temperature and therefore excessive heat build-up should be avoided. Extruders having a high length to diameter ratio L/D more than 15, preferably of at least 20 and in particular of at least 25 are preferred. The modern extruders typically have an L/D ratio of from about 30 to 35. The polymer melt is extruded through an annular die, which may be arranged either as end-fed or side-fed configuration. The side-fed dies are often mounted with their axis parallel to that of the extruder, requiring a right-angle turn in the connection to the extruder. The advantage of side-fed dies is that the mandrel can be extended through the die and this allows, for instance, easy access for cooling water piping to the mandrel. After the plastic melt leaves the die it is calibrated to the correct diameter. In one method the extrudate is directed into a metal tube (calibration sleeve). The inside of the extrudate is pressurised so that the plastic is pressed against the wall of the tube. According to another method the extrudate leaving the die is directed into a tube having a perforated section in the centre. A slight vacuum is drawn through the perforation to hold the pipe against the walls of the sizing chamber. After the sizing the pipe is cooled, typically in a water bath having a length of about 5 metres or more. Production of Fittings of the invention: Fittings of the invention can be produced from the multimodal polypropylene composition according to the present invention using the methods and equipment known in the art. Thus, according to one preferred method the multimodal polypropylene composition is moulded, preferably injection moulded or blown moulded, more preferably injection moulded, in a conventional manner using conventional moulding equipment, to a shape of a fitting for a pipe. Examples: 1. Determination Methods a) Melt Flow Rate The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is indicated in g/10 min. The MFR is an indication of the flowability, and hence the processability, of the polymer. The higher the melt flow rate, the lower the viscosity of the polymer. The MFR10 of polypropylene is measured at a temperature 230 °C and a load of 10 kg, the MFR2 of polypropylene at a temperature 230 °C and a load of 2.16 kg. The quantity FRR (flow rate ratio) denotes the ratio of flow rates at different loads. Thus, FRR10/2 denotes the ratio of MFR10/MFR2. The melt index MFR2 which is not accessible to direct measurement, such as the MFR2 of the fraction of the second polymerization stage, is herein assumed to follow the following mixing rule: MIb = (wx ■ MI^0'0965 + w2 ■ m/^°-0965)_Oks Where w is the weight fraction of the component in the mixture, Ml is the melt index MFR2 and subscripts b, 1 and 2 refer to the mixture, component 1 and component 2, respectively. b) Density Density of the polymer was measured according to ISO 1183-1:2004 Method A on compression moulded specimen prepared according to ΕΝ ISO 1872-2(February 2007) and is given in kg/m3. c) Comonomer content The comonomer content was determined by quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) after basic assignment calibrated via quantitative 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in a manner well known in the art. Thin films are pressed to a thickness of between 100-500 micrmeter and spectra recorded in transmission mode. Specifically, the ethylene content of a polypropylene-co-ethylene copolymer is determined using the baseline corrected peak area of the quantitative bands found at 720-722 and 730-733 cm'1. Specifically, the butene or hexene content of a polypropylene copolymer is determined using the baseline corrected peak area of the quantitative bands found at 1377-1379 cm'1. Quantitative results are obtained based upon reference to the film thickness. The comonomer content which is not accessible to direct measurement, such as the comonomer content of the fraction of the second polymerization stage, is herein assumed to follow the mixing rule: Cb = w1 ■ Ci + iv 2 · C2 Where C is the content of comonomer in weight-%, w is the weight fraction of the component in the mixture and subscripts b, 1 and 2 refer to the overall mixture, component 1 and component 2, respectively. As it is well known to the person skilled in the art the comonomer content in weight basis in a binary copolymer can be converted to the comonomer content in mole basis by using the following equation where cm is the mole fraction of comonomer units in the copolymer, cw is the weight fraction of comonomer units in the copolymer, MWC is the molecular weight of the comonomer (such as ethylene) and MWm is the molecular weight of the main monomer (i.e., propylene). d) Xylene Cold Solubles Xylene cold solubles (XCS, wt.-%) content was determined at 25 °C according ISO 16152; first edition; 2005-07-01. The content of xylene soluble polymer which is not accessible to direct measurement, such as the XCS of the fraction of the second polymerization stage, is herein assumed to follow the mixing rule: XSb = w-l ■ XSx -(- w2 ■ XS2 Where XS is the content of xylene soluble polymer in weight-%, w is the weight fraction of the component in the mixture and subscripts b, 1 and 2 refer to the overall mixture, component 1 and component 2, respectively. ℮) Flexural Modulus The flexural modulus was determined according to ISO 178. The test specimens having a dimension of 80 χ 10 χ 4.0 mm3 (length χ width χ thickness) were prepared by injection molding according to ΕΝ ISO 1873-2. The length of the span between the supports was 64 mm, the test speed was 2 mm/min and the force was 100 Ν. f) Tensile stress at yield, Tensile strain at yield Tensile stress at yield and tensile strain at yield was determined according to ISO 527-1:1996 and ISO 527-2:1996 on test specimen ISO 527-2:1996 type 1Α molded specimen, the Injection moulding carried out according to ISO 1873-2:2007. g) Charpy Notched Impact Stength Charpy notched impact strength (Charpy NIS) was determined according to ISO 179-1:2000 on notched specimen of 80x10x4mm, cut from test specimen ISO 527-2:1996 type 1Α. Notched impact specimen according to ISO 179-1/1 ℮Α:2000 was used. Testing temperature is 23±2°C. Injection moulding was carried out according to ISO 1873-2:2007. h) Crystallization Temperature The crystallization temperature Tc was measured with a Mettler ΤΑ820 differential scanning calorimetry device (DSC) on 3 ± 0.5 mg samples according to ISO 11357-3:1999. Crystallization temperature was obtained during 10 °C/min cooling and heating scans between 30 °C and 225 °C. The crystallization temperatures were taken as the peaks of the exotherms of said peaks. i) Rheological parameters, Polydispersity Index The characterization of polymer melts by dynamic shear measurements complies with ISO standards 6721-1 and 6721-10. The measurements were performed on an Anton Paar MCR501 stress controlled rotational rheometer, equipped with a 25 mm parallel plate geometry. Measurements were undertaken on compression moulded plates, using nitrogen atmosphere and setting a strain within the linear viscoelastic regime. The oscillatory shear tests were done at Τ 190°C applying a frequency range between 0.01 and 600 rad/s and setting a gap of 1.3 mm. In a dynamic shear experiment the probe is subjected to a homogeneous deformation at a sinusoidal varying shear strain or shear stress (strain and stress controlled mode, respectively). On a controlled strain experiment, the probe is subjected to a sinusoidal strain that can be expressed by r(0 = Υο sin(a>t) (1) If the applied strain is within the linear viscoelastic regime, the resulting sinusoidal stress response can be given by σ(ε) = a0 sin (ωϋ + 5) (2) where a0 and y0 are the stress and strain amplitudes, respectively ω is the angular frequency δ is the phase shift (loss angle between applied strain and stress response) t is the time Dynamic test results are typically expressed by means of several different rheological functions, namely the shear storage modulus G’, the shear loss modulus, G”, the complex shear modulus, G*, the complex shear viscosity, q*, the dynamic shear viscosity, q', the out-of-phase component of the complex shear viscosity q" and the loss tangent, tan δ which can be expressed as follows: G' = ^cosδ [Pa] Υο (3) G' = - sin# [Pa] Υο (4) G* = G’+ iG" [Pa] (5) q* = q' - iq" [Pa.s] (6) ti' = £" [Pa-s] (7) q" = S-' [Pa.s] (8) The values of storage modulus (G’), loss modulus (G”), complex modulus (G*) and complex viscosity (q*) were obtained as a function of frequency (ω). Thereby, e.g. rfo.os rad/s (eta*0.05 rad/s) is used as abbreviation for the complex viscosity at the frequency of 0.05 rad/s. The polydispersity index, PI, is defined by equation 9. PI = G'(l°cop)' Ci)cop = oiforiG' = G") (9) where, 6Ocop is the cross-over angular frequency, determined as the angular frequency for which the storage modulus, G’ equals the loss modulus, G”.

Examples a) Preparation of the catalyst First, 0.1 mol of MgCh x 3 EtOH was suspended under inert conditions in 250 ml of decane in a reactor at atmospheric pressure. The solution was cooled to the temperature of -15°C and 300 ml of cold TiCI4 was added while maintaining the temperature at said level. Then, the temperature of the slurry was increased slowly to 20 °C. At this temperature, 0.02 mol of diethylhexylphthalate (DOP) was added to the slurry. After the addition of the phthalate, the temperature was raised to 135 °C during 90 minutes and the slurry was allowed to stand for 60 minutes. Then, another 300 ml of TiCI4 was added and the temperature was kept at 135 °C for 120 minutes. After this, the catalyst was filtered from the liquid and washed six times with 300 ml heptane at 80 °C. Then, the solid catalyst component was filtered and dried. Catalyst and its preparation concept is described in general e.g. in patent publications ΕΡ 491 566, ΕΡ 591 224 and ΕΡ 586 390. For the preparation of Examples Εχ1, Εχ2 and Ex 3 triethylaluminium (TEAL), dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane (DCPDMS) as donor (Do), catalyst as produced above and vinylcyclohexane (VCH) were added into oil, like mineral oil, e.g. Technol 68 (kinematic viscosity at 40 °C 62-74 cSt), in amounts so that Al/Ti was 3-4 mol/mol, Al/Do was as well 3-4 mol/mol, and weight ratio of VCH/solid catalyst was 1:1. The mixture was heated to 60 - 65 °C and allowed to react until the content of the unreacted vinylcyclohexane in the reaction mixture was less than 1000 ppm. Catalyst concentration in the final oil-catalyst slurry was 10-20 wt-%. For the preparation of Reference Example Ref4 the preparation of the oil-catalyst slurry was conducted as described above for Examples Εχ1, Εχ2 and Ex 3 with the exception that no vinylcyclohexane (VCH) was added into oil and no polymerisation step of VCH at 60 - 65 °C was performed. b) Polymerization of Examples Ex 1-3 and Reference Example Ref4 For the polymerization of Examples Εχ1-3 that the catalyst including polymerized VCH was fed together with propylene to a prepolymerization reactor.

The slurry from the prepolymerization stage was directly fed to a loop reactor. Propylene, hydrogen and ethylene were further added to the loop reactor. The polymerization conditions and feeds are listed in Table 1. The slurry from loop reactor was introduced to a gas phase reactor via direct feed line, i.e. without monomer flashing in-between the reactors. Propylene, ethylene and hydrogen were fed to the gas phase reactor. The polymerization conditions and feeds are listed in Table 1. The final Poly-VCH content in the obtained final polymers of Examples Ex. 1-3 was 200 ppm or less.
