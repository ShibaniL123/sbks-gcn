The second step The synthesis of Compound 114
Compound 113 (40mg, 0.078mmol) was dissolved in pyridine (0.7mL). Methanesulfonyl chloride (0.012mL, 0.156mmol) was added thereto under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred for 40 minutes at room temperature. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (20mL) after addition of water (10mL). The organic layer was washed with 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid (10 mL), water (10 mL) and saturated brine (10 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration, the resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 114 (41 mg, yield 81%) as yellow foam.
