PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES FOR MAKING A JAK INHIBITOR This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Appl. No. 61/773,659, filed March 6, 2013, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to processes and intermediates for making {1-{1 -[3-fluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)isonicotinoyl]piperidin-4-yl}-3-[4-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3- d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-lH-pyrazol-l-yl]azetidin-3-yl} acetonitrile, useful in the treatment of diseases related to the activity of Janus kinases (JAK) including inflammatory disorders, autoimmune disorders, cancer, and other diseases. BACKGROUND Protein kinases (PKs) regulate diverse biological processes including cell growth, survival, differentiation, organ formation, morphogenesis, neovascularization, tissue repair, and regeneration, among others. Protein kinases also play specialized roles in a host of human diseases including cancer. Cytokines, low-molecular weight polypeptides or glycoproteins, regulate many pathways involved in the host inflammatory response to sepsis. Cytokines influence cell differentiation, proliferation and activation, and can modulate both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses to allow the host to react appropriately to pathogens. Signaling of a wide range of cytokines involves the Janus kinase family (JAKs) of protein tyrosine kinases and Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). There are four known mammalian JAKs: JAK1 (Janus kinase-1), JAK2, JAK3 (also known as Janus kinase, leukocyte; JAKL; and L-JAK), and ΤΥΚ2 (protein-tyrosine kinase 2). Cytokine-stimulated immune and inflammatory responses contribute to pathogenesis of diseases: pathologies such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) arise from suppression of the immune system, while a hyperactive or inappropriate immune/inflammatory response contributes to the pathology of autoimmune diseases (e.g., asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroiditis, myocarditis), and illnesses such as scleroderma and osteoarthritis (Ortmann, R. A., Τ. Cheng, et αℓ. (2000) Arthritis Res 2(1): 16-32). Deficiencies in expression of JAKs are associated with many disease states. For example, Jakl-/- mice are runted at birth, fail to nurse, and die perinatally (Rodig, S. J., Μ. A. Meraz, et αℓ. (1998) Cell 93(3): 373-83). Jak2-/- mouse embryos are anemic and die around day 12.5 postcoitum due to the absence of definitive erythropoiesis. The JAK/STAT pathway, and in particular all four JAKs, are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of asthmatic response, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, and other related inflammatory diseases of the lower respiratory tract. Multiple cytokines that signal through JAKs have been linked to inflammatory diseases/conditions of the upper respiratory tract, such as those affecting the nose and sinuses (e.g., rhinitis and sinusitis) whether classically allergic reactions or not. The JAK/STAT pathway has also been implicated in inflammatory diseases/conditions of the eye and chronic allergic responses. Activation of JAK/STAT in cancers may occur by cytokine stimulation (e.g. IL-6 or GM-CSF) or by a reduction in the endogenous suppressors of JAK signaling such as SOCS (suppressor or cytokine signaling) or PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) (Boudny, V., and Kovarik, J., Neoplasm. 49:349-355, 2002). Activation of STAT signaling, as well as other pathways downstream of JAKs (e.g., Akt), has been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types (Bowman, Τ., et αℓ. Oncogene 19:2474-2488, 2000). Elevated levels of circulating cytokines that signal through JAK/STAT play a causal role in cachexia and/or chronic fatigue. As such, JAK inhibition may be beneficial to cancer patients for reasons that extend beyond potential anti-tumor activity. JAK2 tyrosine kinase can be beneficial for patients with myeloproliferative disorders, e.g., polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis (ΜΜΜ) (Levin, et αℓ., Cancer Cell, vol. 7, 2005: 387-397). Inhibition of the JAK2V617F kinase decreases proliferation of hematopoietic cells, suggesting JAK2 as a potential target for pharmacologic inhibition in patients with PV, ET, and ΜΜΜ. Inhibition of the JAKs may benefit patients suffering from skin immune disorders such as psoriasis, and skin sensitization. The maintenance of psoriasis is believed to depend on a number of inflammatory cytokines in addition to various chemokines and growth factors (JCI, 113:1664-1675), many of which signal through JAKs (Adv Pharmacol. 2000;47:113-74). JAK1 plays a central role in a number of cytokine and growth factor signaling pathways that, when dysregulated, can result in or contribute to disease states. For example, IL-6 levels are elevated in rheumatoid arthritis, a disease in which it has been suggested to have detrimental effects (Fonesca, J.E. et al., Autoimmunity Reviews, 8:538-42, 2009). Because IL-6 signals, at least in part, through JAK1, antagonizing IL-6 directly or indirectly through JAK1 inhibition is expected to provide clinical benefit (Guschin, D., Ν., et al Embo J 14:1421, 1995; Smolen, J. S., et al. Lancet 371:987, 2008). Moreover, in some cancers JAK1 is mutated resulting in constitutive undesirable tumor cell growth and survival (Mullighan CG, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 106:9414-8, 2009; Flex Ε., et al.J Exp Med. 205:751-8, 2008). In other autoimmune diseases and cancers elevated systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines that activate JAK1 may also contribute to the disease and/or associated symptoms. Therefore, patients with such diseases may benefit from JAK1 inhibition. Selective inhibitors of JAK1 may be efficacious while avoiding unnecessary and potentially undesirable effects of inhibiting other JAK kinases. Selective inhibitors of JAK1, relative to other JAK kinases, may have multiple therapeutic advantages over less selective inhibitors. With respect to selectivity against JAK2, a number of important cytokines and growth factors signal through JAK2 including, for example, erythropoietin (Ερο) and thrombopoietin (Τρο) (Parganas Ε, et al. Cell. 93:385-95, 1998). Ερο is a key growth factor for red blood cells production; hence a paucity of Epo-dependent signaling can result in reduced numbers of red blood cells and anemia (Kaushansky Κ, NEJM 354:2034-45, 2006). Τρο, another example of a JAK2-dependent growth factor, plays a central role in controlling the proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes - the cells from which platelets are produced (Kaushansky Κ, NEJM 354:2034-45, 2006). As such, reduced Τρο signaling would decrease megakaryocyte numbers (megakaryocytopenia) and lower circulating platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). This can result in undesirable and/or uncontrollable bleeding. Reduced inhibition of other JAKs, such as JAK3 and Tyk2, may also be desirable as humans lacking functional version of these kinases have been shown to suffer from numerous maladies such as severe-combined immunodeficiency or hyperimmunoglobulin Ε syndrome (Minegishi, Υ, et al. Immunity 25:745-55, 2006; Macchi Ρ, et al. Nature. 377:65-8, 1995). Therefore a JAK1 inhibitor with reduced affinity for other JAKs would have significant advantages over a less-selective inhibitor with respect to reduced side effects involving immune suppression, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Due to the usefulness of JAK inhibitors, there is a need for development of new processes for making JAK inhibitors. This invention is directed towards this need and others.

A solution of diphenylmethanamine (2737 g, 15.0 mol, 1.04 equiv) in methanol (Μ℮ΟΗ, 6 L) was treated with 2-(chloromethyl)oxirane (1330 g, 14.5 mol) from an addition funnel at ambient temperature. During the initial addition a slight endotherm was noticed. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 days before being warmed to reflux for an additional 3 days. When TLC showed that the reaction was deemed complete, the reaction mixture was first cooled down to room temperature and then to 0 - 5 °C in an ice bath. The solids were collected by filtration and washed with acetone (4 L) to give the first crop of the crude desired product (1516 g). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and the resulting semisolid was diluted with acetone (1 L). This solid was then collected by filtration to give the second crop of the crude desired product (221 g). The crude product, l-benzhydrylazetidin-3-ol hydrochloride (1737 g, 3998.7 g theoretical, 43.4 % yield), was found to be sufficiently pure to be used in the subsequent reaction without further purification. 1HNMR (300 MHz, DMSO-t/6) δ 12.28 (br. d, 1Η), 7.7 (m, 5Η), 7.49 (m, 5Η), 6.38 (d, 1Η), 4.72 (br. s, 1Η), 4.46 (m, 1Η), 4.12 (m, 2Η), 3.85 (m, 2Η) ppm; Ci6H18C1NO (MW 275.77; Ci6Hi7NO for free base, MW, 239.31), LCMS (El) m/e 240 (M+ + Η). tert- Butyl 3-hydroxyazetidine-l-carboxylate (17). A suspension of 1-benzhydrylazetidin-3-ol hydrochloride (625 g, 2.27 mol) in a 10 % solution of aqueous sodium carbonate (Na2C03, 5 L) and dichloromethane (CH2CI2, 5 L) was stirred at room temperature until all solids were dissolved. The two layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (CH2CI2, 2 L). The combined organics extracts were dried over sodium sulfate (Na2S04) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude l-benzhydrylazetidin-3-ol free base was then dissolved in THF (6 L) and the solution was placed into a large Parr bomb. Di-Art-butyl dicarbonate (BOC2O, 545 g, 2.5 mol, 1.1 equiv) and 20 % palladium (Pd) on carbon (125 g, 50 % wet) were added to the Parr bomb. The vessel was charged to 30 psi with hydrogen gas (H2) and stirred under steady hydrogen atmosphere (vessel was recharged three times to maintain the pressure at 30 psi) at room temperature for 18 h. When HPLC showed that the reaction was complete (no more hydrogen was taken up), the reaction mixture was fdtered through a Celite pad and the Celite pad was washed with THF (4 F). The fdtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent and the residue was loaded onto a Biotage 150 column with a minimum amount of dichloromethane (CH2CI2). The column was eluted with 20 - 50 % ethyl acetate in w-heptane and the fractions containing the pure desired product, Art-butyl 3-hydroxyazetidine-l-carboxylate, were collected and combined. The solvents were removed under reduced pressure to afford Art-butyl 3-hydroxyazetidine-l-carboxylate (357 g, 393.2 g theoretical, 90.8 % yield) as a colorless oil, which solidified upon standing at ambient temperature in vacuum. 1HNMR (300 MHz, CDC13), δ 4.56 (m 1Η), 4.13 (m, 2Η), 3.81 (m, 2Η), 1.43 (s, 9Η) ppm. Art-Butyl 3-oxoazetidine-l-carboxylate (18). A solution of Art-butyl 3-hydroxyazetidine-l-carboxylate (50 g, 289 mmol) in ethyl acetate (400 mL) was cooled to 0 °C. The resulting solution was then treated with solid TEMPO (0.5 g, 3.2 mmol, 0.011 equiv) and a solution of potassium bromide (KBr, 3.9 g, 33.2 mmol, 0.115 equiv) in water (60 mL) at 0 - 5 °C. While keeping the reaction temperature between 0 - 5 °C, a solution of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCCb, 450 mL) and an aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution (NaCIO, 10 - 13 % available chlorine, 450 mL) were added. Once the solution of sodium hypochlorite was added, the color of the reaction mixture was changed immediately. When additional amount of sodium hypochlorite solution was added, the color of the reaction mixture was gradually faded. When TLC showed that all of the starting material was consumed, the color of the reaction mixture was no longer changed. The reaction mixture was then diluted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc, 500 mL) and two layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with water (500 mL) and the saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (500 mL) and dried over sodium sulfate (Na2S04). The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure to give the crude product, Art-butyl 3-oxoazetidine-l-carboxylate (48 g, 49.47 g theoretical, 97% yield), which was found to be sufficiently pure and was used directly in the subsequent reaction without further purification. 1HNMR (CDCI3, 300 MHz) δ 4.65 (s, 4Η), 1.42 (s, 9Η) ppm. Art-Butyl 3-(cyanomethylene)azetidine-l-carboxylate (2). Diethyl cyanomethyl phosphate (745 g, 4.20 mol, 1.20 equiv) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, 9 L) were added to a four-neck flask equipped with a thermowell, an addition funnel and the nitrogen protection tube at room temperature. The solution was cooled with an ice-methanol bath to - 14 °C and a 1.0 Μ solution of potassium Art-butoxide (tBuOK) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, 3.85 L, 3.85 mol, 1.1 equiv) was added over 20 min keeping the reaction temperature below - 5 °C. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h at - 10 °C and a solution of l-Art-butoxycarbonyl-3-azetidinone (600 g, 3.50 mol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, 2 L) was added over 2 h keeping the internal temperature below - 5 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred at - 5 to - 10 °C over 1 h and then slowly warmed up to room temperature and stirred at room temperature for overnight. The reaction mixture was then diluted with water (4.5 L) and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (NaCl, 4.5 L) and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc, 2 χ 9 L). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (6 L) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2S04). The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was diluted with dichloromethane (CH2CI2, 4 L) before being absorbed onto silica gel (SiCb, 1.5 Kg). The crude product, which was absorbed on silica gel, was purified by flash column chromatography (SiCb, 3.5 Kg, 0 - 25% EtOAc/hexanes gradient elution) to afford A/7-butyl 3-(cyanomethylene)azetidine-l-carboxylate (2, 414.7 g, 679.8 g theoretical, 61% yield) as a white solid.

A flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet, an addition funnel, a thermowell, and a mechanical stirrer was charged with pyrazole (1, 450 g, 6.62 mol) and tetrahydrofuran (THF, 5 L) at ambient temperature. The mixture was then cooled to 10 °C and /V-iodosuccinimide (NIS, 1490 g, 6.62 mol, 1.0 equiv) was added to the mixture in portions as a solid at approximately 10 °C. The resulting reaction mixture was then stirred at ambient temperature for 1 hour (longer reaction times may be necessary depending on ambient temperature). The mixture was then fdtered and the THF was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was suspended in ethyl acetate (6 F) and insoluble materials were fdtered. The dark fdtrate was sequentially washed with saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution (2 χ 3 F) (organic layer lightens to a pale yellow), water (2x3 F), and brine (2 F). The resulting organic layer was then dried over sodium sulfate, fdtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 4-iodopyrazole (1138 g, 1284.1 g theoretical, 88.6%) as a white to pale yellow solid after being dried in a vacuum oven at approximately 30 °C overnight.

To a flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a nitrogen inlet, mechanical stirrer, and a thermowell was charged 4-iodopyrazole (200 g, 1.03 mol) and THF (2 L) at ambient temperature. To this solution was added triethylamine (TEA, 158 mL, 1.13 mol, 1.1 equiv) and the resulting solution was cooled to 0 °C in an ice-brine bath. To this solution was added chlorotrimethylsilane (TMS-C1, 137 mL, 1.08 mol, 1.05 equiv) with vigorous stirring allowing the temperature to reach 18 °C. (The reaction becomes very thick and difficult to stir, but becomes manageable after over time). When the exothermic process had subsided, the cold bath was removed and the reaction was warmed to room temperature. The reaction was followed by GC and was found to be deemed complete after about 1 hour (sampling of reaction must be done out of air and diluted with dry solvent to prevent TMS hydrolysis). The reaction mixture was then diluted with w-heptane (2 L) before being filtered under nitrogen. The solvent was removed from the filtrate under reduced pressure venting the rotovap with nitrogen. The residual oil was diluted with u-heptane (1 L) and re-concentrated. If the solids formed upon adding the w-heptane, a second filtration was necessary. The residue was then distilled under the reduced pressure (70 - 90 °C at about 0.5 Torr) using a Kugelohr to afford l-trimethylsilyl-4-iodopyrazole (263 g, 274.1 g theoretical, 96%) as a colorless oil. This material must be kept under nitrogen at all times since the TMS group rapidly hydrolyzes. Subsequently, it was found that l-trimethylsilyl-4-iodopyrazole can be prepared by heating the iodopyrazole with 2 equivalents of hexamethyldisilazane for 1 hr. 4-(4,4,5,5-Tetramethyl-l,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl) -l//-pyrazole (1). A flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a nitrogen inlet, an addition funnel and a thermowell was charged with 1 -trimethylsilyl-4-iodopyrazole (225.1 g, 0.85 mol) and THF (2200 mL) at ambient temperature. This mixture was cooled to approximately 6 °C in an ice/salt/brine bath before a solution of isopropyl magnesium chloride in THF (2 Μ solution in THF, 510 mL, 1.02 mol, 1.2 equiv) was added at a rate such that the internal temperature did not exceed 0 °C. The extent of metal/halogen exchange was monitored by GC and was found complete after about 10 min. To the orange brown solution was then added 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-l,3,2-dioxaborolane (isopropylpinacolborate, 347 mL, 1.7 mol, 2.0 equiv) slowly at first keeping the temperature below 0 °C and then fairly rapidly after about half of the compound was added allowing the temperature to reach 5 °C (the reaction becomes quite thick and then thins out slowly). The reaction is then stirred at 0 °C for 10 min before being warmed to ambient temperature over 1 h and stirred at ambient temperature for an additional 1 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to approximately 6 °C and the saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (NH4CI, 2.2 L) was added with a temperature increase to 25 °C. The mixture was stirred for 5 minutes before being diluted with toluene (10 L). The layers were separated (a large amount of solid is present in the aqueous layer) and the organic layer was sequentially washed with water (6 χ 2.2 L) and brine (2 χ 2.2 L) before being dried over sodium sulfate (Na2S04). The drying reagent, sodium sulfate (Na2S04), was removed by fdtration and the solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. Residual toluene was coevaporated with M-heptane to afford 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-l,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-1 /7-pyrazolc (1, 90.3 g, 164.9 g theoretical, 54.8%) as a white solid.

Pyrazole (19, 34.0 g, 0.5 mol) andNBS (89.0 g, 0.5 mol, 1.0 equiv) were suspended in water (625 ml) at ambient temperature. The resulting suspension was stirred at ambient temperature for overnight. The reaction mixture was then extracted with EtOAc (2 χ 100 mL). The combined EtOAc extracts were washed with aqueous Na2S203 and brine, dried over Na2S04, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford crude 4-bromopyrazole (72.0 g, 73.5 g theoretical, 98% yield) as white solids (GC purity: >98%), which was directly used in the subsequent reaction without further purification. 4-Bromo-l -(ethoxyethyl)-l //-pyrazole (23). To a solution of 4-bromopyrazole (70.0 g, 0.476 mol) in CH2C12 (600 mL) was added a solution of 3.1 Μ HCI in dioxane (4 mL) and ethyl vinyl ether (41 g, 0.569 mol, 1.2 equiv) at ambient temperature. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 3 h. The reaction was quenched with aqueous NaHCCb and the two layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with water, dried over Na2S04, and concentrated under reduced pressure to dryness to afford 4-bromo-1 -icthoxycthyl)-1 /7-pyrazolc (113 g, 104.3 g theoretical, 97% yield) as an oil (GC purity: 89%), which was directly used in the subsequent reaction without further purification. l-(Ethoxyethyl)-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl[l,3,2]dioxaborolan-2-yl)-l//-pyrazole (24). To a 100 ml solution of /PrMgCl.LiCl (50 mmol, 1.8 equiv) in THF was added 4-bromo-1 -(cthoxycthyl)-1 //-pyrazole (6.15 g, 28 mmol) at ambient temperature. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 12 h and then cooled to - 20 °C. Methoxy pinacolborate (10.6 g, 67 mmol, 2.4 equiv) was then added to the reaction mixture at - 20 °C. The resulting mixture was stirred at 0 - 10 °C for 1 h. Aqueous NH4C1 was added to quench the reaction. The mixture was then extracted with petroleum ether (PE). The combined PE extracts were washed with saturated NaHCCb, dried over Na2S04 and concentrated under reduced pressure.

The resulting reaction mixture was then stirred at 10 - 20 °C for 3 - 5 hours. After the selective deprotection reaction was complete as monitored by HPLC (1: below 1%), the reaction mixture was degassed and refdled with nitrogen before being cooled to - 15 °C. The cooled reaction mixture was then added triethylamine (TEA, 30.0 kg, 296.5 mol) to adjust pH to 7 - 8. The mixture was then gradually warmed to ambient temperature before being treated with water (150 kg). The two phases were separated and the organic layer was washed with brine (60 kg) and dried over sodium sulfate (Na2S04). The drying reagent, sodium sulfate (Na2S04), was removed by fdtration and the resulting solution was concentrated under reduced pressure at 40 - 50 °C to a thick oil. The residue was warmed to 60 70 °C and diluted with petroleum ether (100 kg) at the same temperature. The resulting mixture was then gradually cooled to ambient temperature and subsequently to - 5 °C and stirred at the same temperature for 3 hours. The solids was collected by centrifugation and dried at 50 - 60 °C under vacuum to afford the crude desired product (1, 33.75 kg, 40.11 kg theoretical, 84.1%). The crude desired product was then suspended in 1,2-dichloroethane (30 kg) and the resulting mixture was heated to reflux until a clear solution was formed. To the hot solution was then added petroleum ether (150 kg) at the same temperature. The resulting mixture was then gradually cooled to ambient temperature and subsequently to - 5 °C and stirred and the same temperature for 3 hours. The solids were collected by centrifugation and dried under vacuum at 50 - 60 °C to afford 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-l,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl) -1/7-pyrazolc (1, 31.0 kg, 40.11 kg theoretical, 77.3%) as an off-white solid, which is identical in every comparable aspect to the material synthesized by the synthetic method as described above in Example 5.

In a 5 L 4-neck flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an addition funnel, a condenser, a thermocouple, and a Ν2 sweep into an aqueous NaOH scrubbing solution, phosphorous oxychloride (POCI3, 1 L, 10.572 mol, 4.82 equiv) was charged and cooled in an ice/salt bath. Ν,Ν-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 320 mL, 4.138 mol, 1.85 equiv) was then added dropwise to the flask at 0 ± 2 °C. After addition of approximately 100 mL of DMF over approximately 0.5 h, crystallization occurred and the reaction temperature was increased from 0 to 10 °C. Addition was stopped and the mixture was allowed to recool to approximately 2 °C. The remaining DMF was added over 2.5 h at below 8 °C. The suspension became very thick making stirring difficult. When addition of DMF was complete, the mixture was stirred at 3 - 5 °C for 0.5 h. 4,6-Dihydroxypyrimidine (250 g, 2.232 mol) was added portion wise as a solid. After about one third of 4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine was added, the reaction mixture became more mobile, and a slow exothermic phenomena occurred with the reaction temperature increasing to approximately 12 °C over 0.5 h. The remaining 4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine was added portion wise over 0.25 h with the reaction temperature increasing from 12 to 27 °C. The reaction temperature was maintained at 25 - 27 °C with intermittent cooling during which time the yellow suspension became thinner, then thicker once again. After the exothermic phenomenon subsided in about 1 h, the reaction mixture was heated slowly. At about 55 °C the reaction mixture became extremely thick and the second mild exothermic phenomenon was occurred. The heating mantle was removed while the reaction temperature continued to increase to about 63 °C and remained at this temperature for several minutes before dropping. Heating of the mixture was resumed until gentle reflux (about 100°C) was attained. At about 95 °C a steady, fairly rapid evolution of HC1 gas began and the reaction mixture gradually thinned and darkened. After about 0.5 h, a clear brown solution developed with the reflux temperature slowly increasing to 115 °C over 1.25 h. After a total of 2.5 h at reflux, the reaction mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and stirred overnight at ambient temperature. Excess amount of POCI3 (as much as possible) was removed under reduced pressure (bath temperature 45 - 50 °C). The thick residual brown oil was poured very slowly into cold H20 (5 L) in a 20 L separation funnel, adding ice as needed to maintain the aqueous mixture near room temperature. The aqueous mixture was extracted with EtOAc (2 χ 3 L followed by 1 χ 2 L). The combined EtOAc extracts were washed with H?0 (2 χ 2.5 L), saturated NaHCCb aqueous solution (1 L), brine (1 L), dried over Na2S04, fdtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure (bath temperature at 35°C) to afford the crude 4,6-dichloropyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde (270 g, 395 g theoretical, 68.4%) as yellow-orange solids. A 20 g portion of this crude material was purified by Kugelrohr distillation (oven temperature at 90- 100 °C, 225 mTorr) to give 15.3 g of pure 4,6-dichloropyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde as a white solid that turned yellow on standing at room temperature. 1Η NMR (300 MHz, CDCI3) δ 10.46 (s, 1Η), 8.89 (s,lH) ppm. 4-Amino-6-chloropyrimidme-5-carbaldehyde (27). A solution of 7 Μ ΝΗ3 in Μ℮ΟΗ (265 mL, 1.855 mol, 2.0 equiv) was added over 1.25 h to a solution of 4,6-dichloropyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde (163.7 g, 0.9301 mol) in toluene (3 L) at ambient temperature. The reaction temperature slowly increased from 20 to 26 °C and a yellow suspension formed. Mild cooling was applied to maintain the reaction temperature at below 26 °C. The suspension was stirred at ambient temperature for 3.5 h before the solids were collected by fdtration. The solids were washed with EtOAc (1 L). The fdtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the solids were triturated with toluene and w-heptane (2:1 ν/ν, 600 mL), filtered and dried to give 71.1 g of 4-amino-6-chloropyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde as a yellow solid. The original solid filtered from the reaction mixture contained additional amount of 4-amino-6-chloropyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde. The product was extracted from the filtered solid by stirring in EtOAc (1.25 L) for 1.5 h, filtering, then stirring in THF (750 mL) for 1 h and again filtering. Both EtOAc and THF filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting solids were triturated with toluene and η-heptane (2:1 ν/ν, 450 mL), filtered and dried to give an additional 44.1 g of 4-amino-6-chloropyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde as a yellow solid. The combined yield of 4-amino-6-chloropyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde (115.2 g, 146.5 g theoretical) was 78.6%. 1HNMR (300 MHz, DMSO-t/6) δ 10.23 (s, 1Η), 8.71 (bs,lH), 8.55 (bs, 1Η), 8.39 (s, 1Η) ppm; C5H4CIN3O (MW, 157.56), LCMS (El) m/e 158 (M+ + Η). 6-Chloro-5-(2-methoxyvmyl)pyrimidin-4-ylamme (28). A suspension of (methoxymethyl)triphenylphosphonium chloride (276.0 g, 0.807 mol, 1.1 equiv) in THF (1.5 L) was cooled in an ice/salt bath to - 2 °C and 1 Μ potassium tert-butoxide (KCfBu) in THF (807 mL, 0.807 mol, 1.1 equiv) was added over 1.5 h at - 2 to - 3 °C. The deep red-orange mixture was stirred at - 2 to - 3 °C for 1 h. 4-Αηΰηο-6-chloropyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde (115.2 g, 0.7338 mol, 1.0 equiv) was then added portion wise to the reaction mixture as a solid form using THF (200 mL) to rinse the container and funnel. During the addition the reaction temperature increased from - 3 to 13 °C and a brown color developed. When the reaction temperature dropped to 10 °C, the cooling bath was removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and stirred at ambient temperature for 42 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to - 2 °C before being quenched by the slow addition of saturated NH4C1 aqueous solution (750 mL). The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove most of the THF. The residue was partitioned between EtOAc (3 L) and Η2Ο (1 L). The organic phase was fdtered to remove insoluble material at the interface, then extracted with 2 Ν HC1 (4 χ 250 mL) followed by 3 Ν HC1 (2 χ 250 mL). The combined HC1 extracts were back-extracted with EtOAc (500 mL) then fdtered through Celite to remove insoluble material. The fdtrate was cooled in an ice/brine bath, adjusted to pH 8 with a 6 Ν aqueous NaOH solution and extracted with EtOAc (3x1 L). The combined EtOAc extracts were washed with brine (1 L), dried over Na2S04, stirred with charcoal (10 g) and silica gel (10 g) for 1 h. The mixture was fdtered through Celite, washing the Celite pad with EtOAc (1 L). The fdtrate was concentrated, co-evaporating residual EtOAc with w-heptane (500 mL). The resulting tan solid was pumped under high vacuum for 2 h to afford crude 6-chloro-5-(2-methoxyvinyl)pyrimidin-4-ylamine (72.3 g, 136.2 g theoretical, 53.1%). The crude desired product was used in the following reaction without further purification. A sample of crude product (2.3 g) was purified by silica gel column chromatography on, eluting with 0 - 35% EtOAc/w-heptane to give 1.7 g of pure 6-chloro-5-(2-methoxyvinyl)pyrimidin-4-ylamine as a white solid, which was found to be a 1 to 2 mixture of Ε/Ζ isomers. 1Η NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-cC) for E-isomer: δ 8.02 (s, 1Η), 7.08 (bs, 2Η), 6.92 (d, 1Η, J= 13.1), 5.35 (d, 1Η, J= 13.0 Hz), 3.68 (s, 3Η) ppm and for Z-isomer: δ 8.06 (s, 1Η), 7.08 (bs, 2Η), 6.37 (d, 1Η, J= 6.8 Hz), 5.02 (d, 1Η, J= 6.7 Hz), 3.69 (s, 3Η) ppm; C7H8C1N30 (MW, 185.61), LCMS (El) m/e 186/188 (M+ + Η). 4-Chloro-7//-|pyrrolo|2,3-r/]pyrimidine (4). Concentrated HC1 (5 mL) was added to a solution of crude 6-chloro-5-(2-methoxyvinyl)pyrimidin-4-ylamine (70.0 g, 0.3784 mol) in THF (700 mL) and the resulting reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 7.5 h. On warming a light suspension was formed that gradually re-dissolved. When the reaction was deemed complete as monitored by HPLC, the reaction mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and stirred at ambient temperature for overnight. Solid NaHCCb (15 g) was added to the reaction mixture and the resulting mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h. Charcoal (7 g), silica gel (7 g) and Na2S04 (20 g) were added and the mixture was heated to 40 °C for 1 h. The mixture was then cooled to ambient temperature and filtered through Celite, washing the Celite pad with THF (1 L). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and the resulting solid was dried under reduced pressure to afford crude 4-chloro-7/7-[pyrrolo[2,3-(/]pyrimidine (4, 58.1 g, 58.1 g theoretical, 100%) as a yellow-brown solid. This crude desired product was dissolved in EtOAc (1 L) at 50 - 55 °C and treated with activated charcoal (3 g). The mixture was filtered while warm through Celite and the Celite pad was washed with warm EtOAc (250 mL). The filtrate was concentrated to about 500 mL and the suspension was allowed to stand at ambient temperature for overnight. The suspension was subsequently cooled to 0 - 5 °C for 2 h before the solids were collected by filtration. The solids were dried to afford pure 4-chloro-77T-[pyrrolo[2,3-(/]pyrimidine (4, 54.5 g, 58.1 g theoretical, 94%) as yellowbrown crystals. *H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-t/6) δ 12.58 (bs, 1Η), 8.58 (s,lH), 7.69 (d,lH, J= 3.5 Hz), 6.59 (d, 1Η, J= 3.5 Hz) ppm; LCMS (El) m/e 154/156 (M+ +Η). Example A: In vitro JAK Kinase Assay The compound of Formula I was tested for inhibitory activity of JAK targets according to the following in vitro assay described in Park et αℓ., Analytical Biochemistry1999,269, 94-104. The catalytic domains of human JAK1 (a.a. 837-1142) and JAK2 (a.a. 828-1132) with an N-terminal His tag were expressed using baculovirus in insect cells and purified. The catalytic activity of JAK1 and JAK2 was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of a biotinylated peptide. The phosphorylated peptide was detected by homogenous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF). IC50S of compounds were measured for each kinase in the 40 microL reactions that contain the enzyme, ATP and 500 ηΜ peptide in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.8) buffer with 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1 mg/mL (0.01%) BSA. For the 1 mM IC50 measurements, ATP concentration in the reactions was 1 mM. Reactions were carried out at room temperature for 1 hr and then stopped with 20 pL 45 mM EDTA, 300 ηΜ SA-APC, 6 ηΜ Eu-Py20 in assay buffer (Perkin Elmer, Boston, ΜΑ). Binding to the Europium labeled antibody took place for 40 minutes and HTRF signal was measured on a Fusion plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Boston, ΜΑ). The compound of Formula I and the adipic acid salt had an IC50 at JAK1 of < 5 ηΜ (measured at 1 1τ1Μ ATP) with a JAK2/JAK1 ratio of > 10 (measured at 1 1τ1Μ ATP). Example Β: Cellular Assays Cancer cell lines dependent on cytokines and hence JAK/STAT signal transduction, for growth, can be plated at 6000 cells per well (96 well plate format) in RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, and 1 nG/mL of appropriate cytokine. Compounds can be added to the cells in DMSO/media (final concentration 0.2% DMSO) and incubated for 72 hours at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The effect of compound on cell viability is assessed using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) followed by TopCount (Perkin Elmer, Boston, ΜΑ) quantitation. Potential off-target effects of compounds are measured in parallel using a non-JAK driven cell line with the same assay readout. All experiments are typically performed in duplicate. The above cell lines can also be used to examine the effects of compounds on phosphorylation of JAK kinases or potential downstream substrates such as STAT proteins, Akt, Shp2, or Erk. These experiments can be performed following an overnight cytokine starvation, followed by a brief preincubation with compound (2 hours or less) and cytokine stimulation of approximately 1 hour or less. Proteins are then extracted from cells and analyzed by techniques familiar to those schooled in the art including Western blotting or ELISAs using antibodies that can differentiate between phosphorylated and total protein. These experiments can utilize normal or cancer cells to investigate the activity of compounds on tumor cell survival biology or on mediators of inflammatory disease. For example, with regards to the latter, cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, or IFN can be used to stimulate JAK activation resulting in phosphorylation of STAT protein(s) and potentially in transcriptional profiles (assessed by array or qPCR technology) or production and/or secretion of proteins, such as IL-17. The ability of compounds to inhibit these cytokine mediated effects can be measured using techniques common to those schooled in the art. Compounds herein can also be tested in cellular models designed to evaluate their potency and activity against mutant JAKs, for example, the JAK2V617F mutation found in myeloid proliferative disorders. These experiments often utilize cytokine dependent cells of hematological lineage (e.g. BaF/3) into which the wildtype or mutant JAK kinases are ectopically expressed (James, C., et αℓ. Nature 434:1144-1148; Staerk, J., et αℓ. JBC 280:41893-41899). Endpoints include the effects of compounds on cell survival, proliferation, and phosphorylated JAK, STAT, Akt, or Erk proteins. Certain compounds herein can be evaluated for their activity inhibiting T-cell proliferation. Such as assay can be considered a second cytokine (i.e. JAK) driven proliferation assay and also a simplistic assay of immune suppression or inhibition of immune activation. The following is a brief outline of how such experiments can be performed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are prepared from human whole blood samples using Ficoll Hypaque separation method and T-cells (fraction 2000) can be obtained from PBMCs by elutriation. Freshly isolated human T-cells can be maintained in culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 pg/ml streptomycin) at a density of 2 χ 106 cells/ml at 37 °C for up to 2 days. For IL-2 stimulated cell proliferation analysis, T-cells are first treated with Phytohemagglutinin (ΡΗΑ) at a final concentration of 10 pg/mL for 72h. After washing once with PBS, 6000 cells/well are plated in 96-well plates and treated with compounds at different concentrations in the culture medium in the presence of 100 U/mL human IL-2 (ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene; Rehovot, Israel). The plates are incubated at 37 °C for 72h and the proliferation index is assessed using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent reagents following the manufactory suggested protocol (Promega; Madison, WI). Example C: In vivo anti-tumor efficacy Compounds herein can be evaluated in human tumor xenograft models in immune compromised mice. For example, a tumorigenic variant of the INA-6 plasmacytoma cell line can be used to inoculate SCID mice subcutaneously (Burger, R., et αℓ. Hematol J. 2:42-53, 2001). Tumor bearing animals can then be randomized into drug or vehicle treatment groups and different doses of compounds can be administered by any number of the usual routes including oral, i.p., or continuous infusion using implantable pumps. Tumor growth is followed over time using calipers. Further, tumor samples can be harvested at any time after the initiation of treatment for analysis as described above (Example Β) to evaluate compound effects on JAK activity and downstream signaling pathways. In addition, selectivity of the compound(s) can be assessed using xenograft tumor models that are driven by other know kinases (e.g. Bcr-Abl) such as the Κ562 tumor model. Example D: Murine Skin Contact Delayed Hypersensitivity Response Test Compounds herein can also be tested for their efficacies (of inhibiting JAK targets) in the T-cell driven murine delayed hypersensitivity test model. The murine skin contact delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response is considered to be a valid model of clinical contact dermatitis, and other T-lymphocyte mediated immune disorders of the skin, such as psoriasis (Immunol Today. 1998 Jan;19(l):37-44). Murine DTH shares multiple characteristics with psoriasis, including the immune infiltrate, the accompanying increase in inflammatory cytokines, and keratinocyte hyperproliferation. Furthermore, many classes of agents that are efficacious in treating psoriasis in the clinic are also effective inhibitors of the DTH response in mice (Agents Actions. 1993 Jan;38(l-2):116-21). On Day 0 and 1, Balb/c mice are sensitized with a topical application, to their shaved abdomen with the antigen 2,4,dinitro-fluorobenzene (DNFB). On day 5, ears are measured for thickness using an engineer’s micrometer. This measurement is recorded and used as a baseline. Both of the animals’ ears are then challenged by a topical application of DNFB in a total of 20 pL (10 pL on the internal pinna and 10 pL on the external pinna) at a concentration of 0.2%. Twenty-four to seventy-two hours after the challenge, ears are measured again. Treatment with the test compounds is given throughout the sensitization and challenge phases (day -1 to day 7) or prior to and throughout the challenge phase (usually afternoon of day 4 to day 7). Treatment of the test compounds (in different concentration) is administered either systemically or topically (topical application of the treatment to the ears). Efficacies of the test compounds are indicated by a reduction in ear swelling comparing to the situation without the treatment. Compounds causing a reduction of 20% or more were considered efficacious. In some experiments, the mice are challenged but not sensitized (negative control). The inhibitive effect (inhibiting activation of the JAK-STAT pathways) of the test compounds can be confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Activation of the JAK-STAT pathway(s) results in the formation and translocation of functional transcription factors. Further, the influx of immune cells and the increased proliferation of keratinocytes should also provide unique expression profile changes in the ear that can be investigated and quantified. Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded ear sections (harvested after the challenge phase in the DTH model) are subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody that specifically interacts with phosphorylated STAT3 (clone 58Ε12, Cell Signaling Technologies). The mouse ears are treated with test compounds, vehicle, or dexamethasone (a clinically efficacious treatment for psoriasis), or without any treatment, in the DTH model for comparisons. Test compounds and the dexamethasone can produce similar transcriptional changes both qualitatively and quantitatively, and both the test compounds and dexamethasone can reduce the number of infiltrating cells. Both systemically and topical administration of the test compounds can produce inhibitive effects, i.e., reduction in the number of infiltrating cells and inhibition of the transcriptional changes. Example Ε: In vivo anti-inflammatory activity Compounds herein can be evaluated in rodent or non-rodent models designed to replicate a single or complex inflammation response. For instance, rodent models of arthritis can be used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of compounds dosed preventatively or therapeutically. These models include but are not limited to mouse or rat collagen-induced arthritis, rat adjuvant-induced arthritis, and collagen antibodyinduced arthritis. Autoimmune diseases including, but not limited to, multiple sclerosis, type I-diabetes mellitus, uveoretinitis, thyroditis, myasthenia gravis, immunoglobulin nephropathies, myocarditis, airway sensitization (asthma), lupus, or colitis may also be used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of compounds herein. These models are well established in the research community and are familiar to those schooled in the art (Current Protocols in Immunology, Vol 3., Coligan, J.E. et αℓ, Wiley Press.; Methods in Molecular Biology: Vol. 225, Inflammation Protocols., Winyard, P.G. and Willoughby, D.A., Humana Press, 2003.). Example F: Animal Models for the Treatment of Dry Eye, Uveitis, and Conjunctivitis Agents may be evaluated in one or more preclinical models of dry eye known to those schooled in the art including, but not limited to, the rabbit concanavalin A (ConA) lacrimal gland model, the scopolamine mouse model (subcutaneous or transdermal), the Botulinumn mouse lacrimal gland model, or any of a number of spontaneous rodent auto-immune models that result in ocular gland dysfunction (e.g. NOD-SCID, MRL/lpr, orNZB/NZW) (Barabino et al., Experimental Eye Research 2004, 79, 613-621 and Schrader et al., Developmental Opthalmology, Karger 2008, 41, 298-312, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Endpoints in these models may include histopathology of the ocular glands and eye (cornea, etc.) and possibly the classic Schirmer test or modified versions thereof (Barabino et al.) which measure tear production. Activity may be assessed by dosing via multiple routes of administration (e.g. systemic or topical) which may begin prior to or after measurable disease exists. Agents may be evaluated in one or more preclinical models of uveitis known to those schooled in the art. These include, but are not limited to, models of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) and endotoxin induced uveitis (EIU). EAU experiements may be performed in the rabbit, rat, or mouse and may involve passive or activate immunization. For instance, any of a number or retinal antigens may be used to sensitize animals to a relevant immunogen after which animals may be challenged ocuarly with the same antigen. The EIU model is more acute and involves local or systemic administration of lipopolysaccaride at sublethal doses. Endpoints for both the EIU and EAU models may include fundoscopic exam, histopathology amongst others. These models are reviewed by Smith et al. (Immunology and Cell Biology 1998, 76, 497-512, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Activity is assessed by dosing via multiple routes of administration (e.g. systemic or topical) which may begin prior to or after measurable disease exists. Some models listed above may also develop scleritis/episcleritis, chorioditis, cyclitis, or iritis and are therefore useful in investigating the potential activity of compounds for the therapeutic treatment of these diseases. Agents may also be evaluated in one or more preclinical models of conjunctivitis known those schooled in the art. These include, but are not limited to, rodent models utilizing guinea-pig, rat, or mouse. The guinea-pig models include those utilizing active or passive immunization and/or immune challenge protocols with antigens such as ovalbumin or ragweed (reviewed in Groneberg, D.A., et al., Allergy 2003, 58, 1101-1113, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Rat and mouse models are similar in general design to those in the guinea-pig (also reviewed by Groneberg). Activity may be assessed by dosing via multiple routes of administration (e.g. systemic or topical) which may begin prior to or after measurable disease exists. Endpoints for such studies may include, for example, histological, immunological, biochemical, or molecular analysis of ocular tissues such as the conjunctiva. Example G: In vivo protection of bone Compounds may be evaluated in various preclinical models of osteopenia, osteoporosis, or bone resorption known to those schooled in the art. For example, ovariectomized rodents may be used to evaluate the ability of compounds to affect signs and markers of bone remodeling and/or density (W.S.S. Jee and W. Yao, J Musculoskel. Nueron. Interact., 2001, 1(3), 193-207, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Alternatively, bone density and architecture may be evaluated in control or compound treated rodents in models of therapy (e.g. glucocorticoid) induced osteopenia (Yao, et al. Arthritis and Rheumatism, 2008, 58(6), 3485-3497; and id. 58(11), 1674-1686, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In addition, the effects of compounds on bone resorption and density may be evaluable in the rodent models of arthritis discussed above (Example Ε). Endpoints for all these models may vary but often include histological and radiological assessments as well as immunohisotology and appropriate biochemical markers of bone remodeling.
