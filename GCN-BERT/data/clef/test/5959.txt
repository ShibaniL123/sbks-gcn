BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION An ionic liquid is a class of salt comprising a cation and an anion that is in liquid at a temperature of 100° C. or less and commonly have melting points below room temperature. While not wishing to be bound by theory, ionic liquids generally have much lower symmetry than conventional salts and the charge of cation and anion is distributed over a larger volume of the molecule by resonance in ionic liquids which is thought to contribute to their liquid state at much lower temperatures than conventional salts (e.g. NaCl, mp 801° C.). Ionic liquids are often composed of a cation comprising a heterocyclic ring and a counter anion, often inorganic in nature. The nature of the cation and anion will determine the hydrophobicity, viscosity, density and other physical parameters and properties of the ionic liquid. Ionic liquids have been evaluated as environmentally-friendly or ‘green’ alternatives to conventional organic solvents for a wide range of organic synthetic applications. Ionic liquids have unique characteristics that distinguish them from conventional organic solvents. For example, ionic liquids are non-volatile (i.e. they do not evaporate readily into the atmosphere), they have a high polarity and charge density, they may be hydrophobic or hydrophilic, and they have unique solvating properties. As such, ionic liquids are known to be used in cleaning compositions (for example, as disclosed in US 2006/0090777 A1 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,939,485 B2). A range of ionic liquids are commercially available, or they may be readily synthesized by simple ion-exchange reactions. It is seen as being desirable by consumers to possess white teeth. Over time, teeth can darken or become stained. Teeth naturally become more yellow with age and can also be stained by food and drink. For example, teeth can be stained by tea, coffee, red wine and tobacco. Certain antibiotics, including for example tetracycline, can also stain teeth. Many consumers wish to whiten teeth to restore the natural colour and in some circumstances wish to whiten teeth beyond their natural colour. It is known to use peroxide-based chemicals to whiten teeth. Carbamide peroxide can be used to bleach teeth. Carbamide peroxide generates hydrogen peroxide upon contact with water and the peroxide oxidizing agent bleaches stains. Whitening can be carried out by a dental professional, by a non-dental professional such as a beauty therapist or alternatively at home by the consumer themselves. Professional tooth whitening is expensive and time consuming However, peroxide compounds are highly reactive, and consequently difficult to formulate. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide can spontaneously decompose to form oxygen gas (O2) and water, so that on storage, the dentifrice containers may bloat, burst or leak, and the remaining formulation will not have enough peroxide remaining to clean and whiten teeth effectively. Some initially comprise very high levels of peroxide, which decomposes over time, so that the exact amount of peroxide delivered on application is variable and largely depends on how long and under what conditions the dentifrice has been stored. Teeth can also be whitened and stains removed using abrasive agents to physically remove stains from the teeth. Abrasive agents can include baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), silica, aluminium oxide, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate. However, abrasive agents can cause damage to the tooth enamel and can be especially damaging to softened tooth enamel that has become soft with age or with repeated attack with oral acids or the use of acidic foods and beverages. Furthermore, abrasive agents are not always suitable for whitening the teeth of those consumers who have dentures, crowns or who wear orthodontics. For these consumers, abrasive whitening agents can damage the ceramic surfaces or may not provide effective reach to clean between orthodontic wiring. A biofilm is a structured group of microorganisms encapsulated within a self-developed polymeric extracellular matrix. Biofilms are typically adhered to a living or inert surface. In the human or animal body biofilms can form on any internal or external surface. Biofilms have been found to be involved in a wide variety of microbial infections in the body and cause a number of conditions including urinary tract infections, middle-ear infections, and in particular, diseases of the oral cavity. Dental plaque is formed from a biofilm precursor, and is present to some degree on virtually all dental surfaces. It comprises a dense microbial layer consisting of a mass of microorganisms embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. Plaque may form on any part of the tooth surface, and is found particularly at the gingival margin, and in cracks in the enamel. The danger associated with the formation of plaque on the teeth lies in the tendency of plaque to build up and eventually produce gingivitis, periodontitis and other types of periodontal disease, as well as dental caries and dental calculus. Plaque itself adheres very firmly to dental surfaces and rapidly reforms on the tooth surface after it is removed. Current plaque removal methods rely primarily on the mechanical removal of plaque. These methods, which include brushing, brushing with an abrasive toothpaste, flossing, using interdental cleaners, scraping, using sonic energy (e.g. Sonicare toothbrushes) and ultrasound (e.g. Ultreo toothbrushes), in part, rely on a good brushing or flossing technique which may consumers simply do not possess. Moreover, these methods are particularly inefficient in removing stubborn plaque, or plaque hidden deep within cavities and fissures of teeth, or within gum pockets. It is also known in the art to incorporate antimicrobial agents in oral compositions which destroy or retard the growth of bacteria. However, bacteria present in a biofilm or plaque deposit exhibit increased resistance to antimicrobial agents because the dense extracellular matrix and the outer layer of cells protect the bacteria found in the interior of the deposit from the effects of the antimicrobial agents. It would be desirable to provide improved methods and compositions for whitening teeth that can achieve whitening benefits without damaging tooth enamel. It would also be desirable to provide improved methods and compositions for whitening the teeth of consumers who possess dentures, crowns or who wear orthodontics.

Delivery The oral care composition of the present invention preferably comprises an orally acceptable carrier for use in a product such as a mouth rinse (including dual phase mouthwash), toothpaste, actives in beads/strips, irrigation fluids, plaque removal fluids, bead formulas, formulations to be delivered through devices such as pens, back of a toothbrush and front of a toothbrush, formulations to be delivered through porous wicking materials, interdental brushes, fluid encased dental strips, floss impregnated or coated with the formulations or dried formulations, portables, oral trays, hard or soft candy, lozenge with a soft plaque dissolving liquid inside, lollipops with the plaque dissolving formulation imbedded into the lickable “candy” that can also help control tongue bacteria, peelable gels, patches, formulations for pop-rocks that upon popping, spread a fine mist of the formulation around oral cavity, tongue cleaners with plaque dissolving strips and dental strips. Accordingly, opportunities exist for professional use of the compositions of the present invention (e.g. during cleanings, irrigations, or aggressive periodontal procedures, such as root planning & scaling). The composition of the invention may be provided in any of the products defined herein. If used in animals or pets, veterinary pastes, chewables or treats may also be used as the orally acceptable carrier. In one embodiment, the composition of the invention can be dried into powder and utilized in a portable sachet. For example, upon mixing such a powder with a suitable solvent such as water, a rinse may be created to remove plaque, proteins and other debris in the mouth. In another embodiment, the composition of the invention can be dried with abrasives such as silica, calcium carbonate or soft capsules that upon addition of small amount of water, creates a paste. Formulations that increase the substantivity of ionic liquids onto a surface could be expected to increase the efficacy of biofilm, and hence plaque removal. For example, Tween 20 while also functioning as a surfactant, is also a wetting agent. Therefore, incorporation of such an agent could be expected to increase the wettability and spreading of a mouth rinse formulation according to the present invention, over the soft and hard tissue, increasing the formulation's propensity for plaque dissolution and removal. Methods of Use The composition according to the present invention may be administered to or applied to a human or other animal subject. The composition may be suitable for administration or application to the oral cavity of a human or animal subject. Typically, the composition is for whitening teeth and/or removing tooth stains. The composition may also dissolve plaque. Furthermore, the reduction or removal of plaque may occur through an inhibition of biofilm (a plaque precursor) formation and/or degradation of microbial biofilm. The present invention provides a method of whitening teeth in a subject comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising an ionic liquid to the subject wherein the ionic liquid comprises a pyrazolium cation and an anion selected from the group consisting of acetate, halide, phosphate, alkyl phosphate, sulphate, alkyl suphate and tosylate. Preferably, the composition is an oral care composition as defined herein, and the composition is applied to the oral cavity. The present invention further provides a use of an ionic liquid, in an oral care composition, for whitening teeth in the oral cavity of a subject. The oral care composition is preferably as defined herein. Compositions comprising an ionic liquid are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria, degrading biofilms, and dissolving dental plaque. They possess the unique ability to offer a deep but gentle cleaning, and promote removal of biofilm and plaque without the need for harsh abrasives or rigorous brushing. The compositions are further able to remove stains and whiten teeth, again without the need for harsh abrasives or rigorous brushing. In particular, ionic liquids are highly effective in whitening artificially stained human teeth when formulated into a mouth rinse. The invention is further illustrated in the following non-limiting examples. EXAMPLES Compositions with Ingredient Ranges for a Whitening Mouth Rinse containing 1,2,4-Trimethylpyrazolium methylsulfate (Table 1): TABLE 1 Ingredient Name Level Range Glycerin 0-20 Propylene Glycol 0-10 Sorbitol 0-20 1,2,4-Trimethylpyrazolium 5-20 methylsulfate Na Benzoate 0-0.11 CPC 0-0.075 Surfactant* 1.5 Sucralose 0.05 Citrate Buffer 10 Flavor 0.15 Water q.s *Polysorbate 20, Polysorbate 80, Pluronic F-108, Pluronic F-127, PEG40 Table 1 provides details of typical compositions for a mouth rinse comprising 1,2,4-trimethylpyrazolium methylsulfate. These amounts are weight percentages based on the total weight of the composition. Three example compositions were tested in order to determine the whitening efficacy. The determination of the whitening efficacy was conducted as follows: After brushing and rinsing, the artificially stained human teeth were allowed to dry and the initial L*a*b* readings recorded (L*a*b* refers to stain score in accordance with the Commission International de L′Eclairage Laboratory (CIELAB) color scale. L* (lightness-darkness scale), a* (red-green chroma) and b* (yellow-blue chroma)). The teeth were then soaked for 28 treatments at 2 minutes per treatment in 1 mL of the prototype whitening mouth rinse. The noted treatment time is typically used to equate 2 weeks' worth of consumer usage when brushing. The teeth were rinsed with DI water after every treatment. The whitening solutions were replenished every 7th treatment. After 28 treatments, the teeth were rinsed with distilled water and allowed to dry. The final L*a*b* readings were then recorded. Whitening values were calculated using Equation 1: ΔW*=W*final−W*initial (where W*=(a*2+b*2+(L*−100)2)1/2−ΔW* (whitening) is used for quantifying the whitening efficacy of each formula. Mouth Rinse Compositions with their respective whitening efficacies, AW and ΔL (Table 2): TABLE 2 Ingredient Level Hydrogen Ingredient peroxide Stain guard Name A B C formulation formulation Glycerin 0 0 10 Propylene 0 2.5 7 Glycol Sorbitol 20 10 2 1,2,4- 20 20 20 Trimethyl- pyrazolium methylsulfate Na Benzoate 0.11 0.11 0.11 CPC 0.075 0.075 0.075 Surfactant Tween Tween Tween 20 20 20 pH 4 5 5 ΔW −23.54 −25.29 −21.05 −19.22 1.68 ΔL 25.17 26.48 22.50 17.34 −2.5 Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate) The results of the whitening analysis are given in Table 2. The more negative the change in Whiteness, ΔW, the whiter the appearance of teeth. The more positive and greater the ΔL value, the lighter the colour of the teeth. The compositions were compared to hydrogen peroxide containing whitening formulation and a formulation with stain guard technology to prevent stains from attaching to the surface of the teeth. As can be seen compositions A, B and C all provided greater whitening efficacy than previously known whitening formulations. 1.
