CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 13/831,317, filed Mar. 14, 2013, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/722,766, filed Nov. 5, 2012, all entitled “PROCESS TO PREPARE LEVULINIC ACID”, the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety for all purposes. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates generally to the preparation and purification of levulinic acid. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Levulinic acid can be used to make resins, plasticizers, specialty chemicals, herbicides and used as a flavor substance. Levulinic acid derivatives are useful as solvents, and as a starting materials in the preparation of a variety of industrial and pharmaceutical compounds such as diphenolic acid (useful as a component of protective and decorative finishes), calcium levulinate (a form of calcium for intravenous injection used for calcium replenishment and for treating hypocalcemia. The use of the sodium salt of levulinic acid as a replacement for ethylene glycols as an antifreeze has also been proposed. Esters of levulinic acid are known to be useful as plasticizers and solvents, and have been suggested as fuel additives. Acid catalyzed dehydration of levulinic acid yields alpha-angelica lactone. Levulinic acid has been synthesized by a variety of chemical methods. But levulinic acid has not attained much commercial significance due in part to the low yields of levulinic acid obtained from most synthetic methods. Yet, another reason is the formation of a formic acid byproduct during synthesis and its separation from the levulinic acid. Therefore, the production of levulinic acid has had high associated equipment costs. Despite the inherent problems in the production of levulinic acid, however, the reactive nature of levulinic acid makes it an ideal intermediate leading to the production of numerous useful derivatives. Cellulose-based biomass, which is an inexpensive feedstock, can be used as a raw material for making levulinic acid. The supply of sugars from cellulose-containing plant biomass is immense and replenishable. Most plants contain cellulose in their cell walls. For example, cotton comprises 90% cellulose. Furthermore, it has been estimated that roughly 75% of the approximate 24 million tons of biomass generated on cultivated lands and grasslands are waste. The cellulose derived from plant biomass can be a suitable source of sugars to be used in the process of obtaining levulinic acid. Thus, the conversion of such waste material into a useful chemical, such as levulinic acid, is desirable. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION There are a few major issues in producing levulinic acid form biomass. First, levulinic acid is difficult to separate from the mineral acid catalysts (sulfuric acid or HCl) or the byproducts, especially from formic acid and char. Secondly, current processes generally require high temperature reaction conditions, generally long digestion periods of biomass, specialized equipment to withstand hydrolysis conditions, and as a result, the yield of the levulinic acid is quite low, generally in yields of less than 50 stoichiometric percent or less. Also, the solids obtained under the current reaction conditions can result in fouling of the reactor and downstream equipment due to plugging or sticking of the char to the internals of the equipment. Therefore, a need exists for a new approach that overcomes one or more of the current disadvantages noted above. The present invention surprisingly provides novel approaches to more efficiently prepare levulinic acid in commercial quantities with high yields and high purities. Additionally, the production of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF) intermediate is also described, which is an important intermediate to the product of levulinic acid. In one aspect, the use of high concentration of acid, e.g., about 20-80 weight percent based on the total weight of reaction components and low reaction temperature (approximately 60-160° C.) helps to improve yield of desired products with reduction of undesired byproducts. This is one attribute, but there are more. While multiple embodiments are disclosed, still other embodiments of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description. As will be apparent, the invention is capable of modifications in various obvious aspects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the detailed descriptions are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive. DETAILED DESCRIPTION In the specification and in the claims, the terms “including” and “comprising” are open-ended terms and should be interpreted to mean “including, but not limited to . . . . ” These terms encompass the more restrictive terms “consisting essentially of” and “consisting of.” It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. As well, the terms “a” (or “an”), “one or more” and “at least one” can be used interchangeably herein. It is also to be noted that the terms “comprising”, “including”, “characterized by” and “having” can be used interchangeably. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All publications and patents specifically mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes including describing and disclosing the chemicals, instruments, statistical analyses and methodologies which are reported in the publications which might be used in connection with the invention. All references cited in this specification are to be taken as indicative of the level of skill in the art. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the invention is not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention. The present invention provides various advantages in the preparation of levulinic acid, hydroxymethyl furfural and/or formic acid. The following list of advantages is not meant to be limiting but highlights some of the discoveries contained herein. First, a biomass material can be used as the initial feedstock to prepare the levulinic acid, hydroxymethyl furfural and/or formic acid. This ability provides great flexibility in obtaining a constant source of starting material and is not limiting. Second, the biomass can be a refined material, such as fructose, glucose, sucrose, mixtures of those materials and the like. As such, there is a plentiful supply of materials that can be converted into the ultimate product(s). For example, sugar beets or sugar cane can be used as one source. Fructose-corn syrup or glucose syrup are other readily available materials. Use of such materials thus helps to reduce the costs to prepare the desired products. Third, it has been discovered that use of high concentrations of acid(s), generally about 20 weight percent or more (based on the total mass of the reaction medium) provides a cleaner reaction product with less char and unwanted byproducts. It has also been found that use of high concentrations of acid(s), generally up to 80 weight percent or more, (based on the total mass of the reaction medium) provides faster reaction times than lower acid concentrations used with the same reaction conditions. Fourth, it has also been discovered that with the use of higher concentrations of acid, the reaction conditions can be conducted at much lower temperatures than are currently utilized in the literature. Again, this lessens the amount of char and byproducts from the reaction(s) that take place and increases the yield of the desired product(s). Fifth, it has also been discovered that with the methods of the present invention, the char that is created is much easier to remove from the reactor and the char remains well-dispersed in the reaction medium. Sixth, it has also been found that the advantages of the new process conditions, including continuous addition of the biomass over a period of time during the reaction can be incorporated into existing processes to improve yield, reduce costs, improve efficiency and improve purity of product(s). Seventh, the processes described herein can be performed via CSTR or continuous batch process conditions. Eighth, an integrated process with recycling and removal of impurities is also provided herein. Ninth, use of highly selective extraction solvents which extract LA, but minimal amounts of sulfuric acid from the reaction medium are provided herein. In one embodiment, This process uses a high concentration of sulfuric acid, which has several distinct advantages. For one, the reactions can be run at lower temperatures compared to low acid processes and still hydrolyze the sugars in a reasonable time frame. It has been discovered that under these high acid, low-temperature reaction conditions (e.g., 60-160° C., preferably, 80-150° C., and more preferably, 90-140° C.), the char byproduct that is formed is in the form of suspended particles that are easier to remove from the reactor and that can be filtered from the liquid hydrolysate product stream. In contrast, with low acid conditions, high temperature is required to effectively hydrolyze the sugar in a reasonable time frame and those conditions produce a char byproduct that coats the reactor components in such a manner that it is difficult to remove without mechanical or hydraulic energy, and for the most part does not stay suspended in the reaction mixture. This high-acid reaction strategy, however, makes it difficult to isolate the organic acid products (levulinic acid and formic acid) from the mineral acid reagent. When small amounts of sulfuric acid are used, as is typical in the prior art, the strong inorganic acid can effectively be neutralized to its salt form by careful addition of stoichiometric amounts of base. At the high acid contents used here, however, the quantity of salt produced would be excessive. Likewise, the use of an ion exchange column is impractical because the large quantity of inorganic acid would quickly fill the capacity of the column. Solvent extraction techniques, where the organic acids are preferably extracted into an organic solvent, are preferred. Even here, the high mineral acid content poses challenges. The organic solvent should be insoluble in the aqueous phase, but in some cases, the sulfuric acid can drive compatibility of the organic solvent and the aqueous phase. When this happens, a portion of the organic solvent becomes soluble in the concentrated sulfuric acid aqueous phase and the risk of solvent loss to side reactions increases. Even if the organic solvent is stable in the aqueous sulfuric acid phase, the organic solvent must be recovered from the aqueous stream before recycling the raffinate back to the reaction unit in order to maintain optimum reaction selectivity to form LA or inoperability due to solids agglomeration in the reactor due to side reactions with the extraction solvent. High mineral acid concentration also carries with it the potential for higher mineral acid concentrations in the organic extract phase. When this happens, there is the risk of solvent loss and LA loss to side reactions catalyzed by the mineral acid, particularly in the case when the organic stream is heated to distill the organic solvent. Therefore, solvent extraction of the organic acid products should ideally have at least some of the following characteristics: little to no miscibility with water; little to no miscibility with the mineral acid; selectively partition the organic acids into the organic solvent phase; have low partitioning of the mineral acid into the organic solvent phase; have low reactivity between the organic extraction solvent and the mineral acid; have low reactivity between the organic extraction solvent & the organic acid products; have the ability to remove or reduce any mineral acid that partitions into the organic phase; easy to remove from organic acid, such as by backwashing or distillation; allow the neutralization or water-washing of the mineral acid. In one embodiment, the partition coefficient of the extraction solvent for levulinic acid is at least 0.3, more specifically, at least 0.5, more specifically, at least 0.7, more specifically, at least 1.0, more specifically at least 1.3, more specifically, at least 1.5 more specifically, at least 1.7, and more specifically at least 2.0, 3 and 4. In one embodiment, the partition coefficient of the extraction solvent for formic acid is at least 0.3, more specifically, at least 0.5, more specifically, at least 0.7, more specifically, at least 1.0, more specifically at least 1.3, more specifically, at least 1.5 more specifically, at least 1.7, and more specifically at least 2.0, more specifically, at least 2.3, more specifically, at least 2.5, more specifically, at least 3.0, more specifically, at least 3.5, more specifically, at least 4.0, more specifically, at least 5.0 more specifically, at least 6.0, more specifically, at least 7.0, more specifically, at least 8.0, and more specifically, at least 9.0. In one aspect, the invention is directed to a process to make crystallizable levulinic acid (“LA”) from sugar solutions. Hydrolysis of an aqueous solution of sucrose, glucose, fructose, or blends of the aforementioned, specifically fructose and sucrose, occurs in a batch or continuous reactor, specifically a continuously fed batch-reactor. In one embodiment the method includes the following steps following hydrolysis of a solution of sucrose, glucose, fructose, or blends of the aforementioned: (a) Filtration of solids from hydrolysate mixture. (b) Water or extraction solvent wash of solids (optional). (c) Extraction of LA and formic acid from aqueous hydrolysate into an extraction solvent. (d) Removal of extraction solvent by distillation. (e) Optional Thin-film evaporation of LA. (f) Optional Crystallization of LA (g) Recycling of extraction solvent to liquid extraction step. (h) Recycling of raffiante phase back to reactor. (i) recovery of formic acid. The process allows fast reaction time, easy to handle char byproduct, good yields, no neutralization step (optional), efficient extraction and distillation to afford a crystallizable LA product. A few processes are known to make LA from sugar, but little is known on how to remove the LA and formic acid from the reactor and purify it from the hydrolysate. The disclosed process produces approximately >80% purity LA that may be distilled or crystallized to a purity >95%. Unless otherwise noted, the concentration of sulfuric acid used is 96-98%. Integrated Process Description An integrated process to synthesize and isolate levulinic acid (LA) using recycled mineral acid is described herein. The integrated process includes: a) providing an aqueous solution of >1% LA in an aqueous mixture comprising 20-80% by weight mineral acid and >0.1% suspended solids from the method comprising the steps: b) heating an aqueous solution of a mineral acid to a temperature from about 60° C. to about 160° C. in a reactor, wherein the mineral acid is present from at least 20 percent by weight to about 80 percent by weight; and c) adding a monosaccharide or di-saccharide to the heated aqueous acid in the reactor to form a reaction mixture at a rate such that the monosaccharide content of the reaction mixture remains less than or equal to about 5% by weight of the reaction mixture, to provide levulinic acid; and d) removing the suspended solids by filtration to make a filtrate with <0.099% suspended solids, e) optionally, washing the solids with water or an aqueous base solution and optionally combining the wash with the filtrate f) extracting the LA from the filtrate of step b (and optionally, c) using an extraction solvent comprising, preferably, a phenolic or substituted phenolic compounds to provide an extract phase containing levulinic and formic acid and a raffinate phase; and g) removing the strong acid impurities from the extract phase to a level below 1%, prior to formic acid separation or extract solvent distillation; and h) removing formic acid by evaporation or distillation from the solvent and levulinic acid; and i) removing the solvent from levulinic acid and recycling it back into an extraction unit; and j) evaporating or distilling any excess water and formic acid form the raffinate phase; k) removing any extraction solvent, preferably, a phenolic or substituted phenolic solvent impurities from the raffinate phase to a level below 1%; and l) recycling the raffinate back to the reactor in order to recycle the acid catalyst in the raffinate.

Step g) may be accomplished by extraction with water, neutralization with a weak base anion exchange resin, or neutralization with an inorganic base; <0.1%, <0.05%, or <0.01% levels of strong acid are preferred. Preferably the amount of water used in step g) is <20% by weight of the extract. Preferably the inorganic base in step g) is an aqueous solution of NaOH, NaHCO3, Na2CO3, Ca(OH)2, CaCO3, Na3PO4, K3PO4, Ca3(PO4)2, BaCO3, Ba(OH)2, NH3, NH4OH or mixtures thereof. Step k) may be accomplished by adsorption with activated carbon or by extraction with a hydrocarbon solvent; Preferably the solvent used in step i) is a C5-C24 straight chain, cyclic, or branched hydrocarbon, an aromatic hydrocarbon, or mineral oil. Preferably the level of phenolic or substituted phenolic solvent in the raffinate is <0.1%, <0.05%, or <0.02% prior to step 1). The process steps (a-l) may be continuous, batch, or semi-continuous. The process may comprise holding tanks in between steps. The process may also contain purge streams for the recycled raffinate stream and the recycled solvent stream. Continuous-Fed Batch Description A batch reactor comprises an initial mixture of sulfuric acid and water, wherein the sulfuric acid concentration is 20-80 wt % of the mixture. The mixture is heated to a temperature of 60-160° C. The contents are stirred with an agitator and optionally recirculated in the reactor. An aqueous solution comprising mono-saccharides and/or di-saccharides is continuously added into the reactor such that the concentration of monosaccharides or the intermediate, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF) does not exceed 5% by weight of the total mixture at any moment in time. Alternatively, the aqueous solution of monosaccharides and disaccharides is continuously added into the reactor such that the feed rate is between 0.15-80 lbs/hour per 100 pounds of the initial mixture of sulfuric acid and water. After the addition of mono-saccharides and di-saccharides, the reaction mixture is optionally held for 5-180 minutes between 60-160° C. Alternatively, after the addition of monosaccharides and disaccharides into the reactor, the reaction mixture is heated to 120-160° C. and held for 5-180 minutes. The reaction mixture is emptied from the reactor when the total amount of monosaccharides is <2%, preferably <1%, more preferably <0.1% and when the total amount of HMF is <1%, preferably <0.1%, more preferably <0.05% Other embodiments: the sugar feeds may be heated from 40-110° C. prior to addition into the reactor. After the reaction, the contents may be cooled when flowing out of the reactor or the reaction mixture may be cooled in the reactor prior to emptying the reaction mixture out of the reactor. The char or solids remains suspended in the reaction mixture throughout the entire reaction. Examples of continuous addition batch reactions are shown in Examples 1 through 8 in the following examples section. Biomass Biomass, as used herein, includes sludges from paper manufacturing process; agricultural residues; bagasse pity; bagasse; molasses; aqueous oak wood extracts; rice hull; oats residues; wood sugar slops; fir sawdust; corncob furfural residue; cotton balls; raw wood flour; rice; straw; soybean skin; soybean oil residue; corn husks; cotton stems; cottonseed hulls; starch; potatoes; sweet potatoes; lactose; sunflower seed husks; sugar; corn syrup; hemp; waste paper; wastepaper fibers; sawdust; wood; residue from agriculture or forestry; organic components of municipal and industrial wastes; waste plant materials from hard wood or beech bark; fiberboard industry waste water; post-fermentation liquor; furfural still residues; and combinations thereof, sugar, a C6 sugar, a lignocelluloses, cellulose, starch, a polysaccharide, a disaccharide, a monosaccharide or mixtures thereof. Reactors One, optionally two, reactors are used to convert fructose to the desired products. The reactors are optionally vented to maintain an internal pressure; the vent stream is optionally collected to recover steam and formic acid product; the vent stream can all be returned to the reactor as a reflux. If there are two reactors in series, the first reactor is optionally controlled at a different temperature and at a high concentration of acid in order to achieve desired conversion and selectivity. The first reactor would generally be controlled at a lower temperature than the second. Optionally, a process step between the two reactors may be used to separate “tar” solids and/or to preferentially extract the reaction products (away from the aqueous feed) to feed into the second reactor. The reactors may be operated in a batch-wise (wherein the reactants are continuously or pulsed-fed to the reactor and the reaction continues until the desired degree of conversion, and the products are then emptied from the reactor) or in a continuous fashion (wherein reactants are fed continuously and the products are removed continuously). In one embodiment, the reactors are run in a continuously-fed batch fashion. In another embodiment, the reactors are run in a continuous mode. The agitation in the reactors should be adequate to prevent agglomeration of solid co-products which may be formed during the reaction. Specifically, the reactors should be designed with sufficient axial flow (from the center of the reactor to the outer diameter and back). Flash (Optional) The reaction products may be optionally cooled in a “flash” process. The flash step rapidly cools the reaction products by maintaining a pressure low enough to evaporate a significant fraction of the products. This pressure may be at or below atmospheric pressure. The evaporated product stream may be refluxed through stages of a distillation column to minimize the loss of desired reaction products, specifically levulinic acid, and to ensure recovery of formic acid reaction. The “bottoms” or less volatile stream from the flash step is advanced to the solids separation stage. Solids Separation In the solids separation stage of the process, the solvent and desired reaction products, specifically levulinic acid and formic acid, are separated from any solids which may have formed during the reaction phase. The solids may be separated through a combination of centrifuge, filtration, and settling steps (ref Perrys Chemical Engineering Handbook, Solids Separation). The separated solids may be optionally washed with water and solvents to recover desired reaction products or solvent which may be entrained in or adsorbed to the solids. It has been found that in some embodiments, such as those reactions employing high levels of mineral acid (greater than 20%) that are reacted at lower temperatures, such as between 60-160° C., the solids may have density properties similar to the liquid hydrolysate which effectively allows the solids to be suspended in solution. In these embodiments, certain separation techniques such as centrifugation are not as effective. In these embodiments filtration utilizing filter media having a pore size less than about 20 microns has been found to effectively remove solids from the mixture. When removing solids from the system a solid “cake” is formed. It is desirable that the cake be up to 50% solids. Thus any separation technique that obtains a cake having a higher amount of solids is preferred. A certain amount of LA and mineral acid will be present in the cake and it may be desirable to wash the cake with an extraction solvent or water to recover LA. It has also been surprisingly found that the solid particles in the high mineral acid and lower temperature embodiments are easily filtered and do not inhibit flow as the cake is formed. It is believed that the properties of the char formed under these process conditions are such that any cake remains porous enough that a small filter size (less than 20 microns) can be utilized while maintaining a high flow rate through the medium. The isolated solids may be incinerated to generate power or disposed. The liquid stream, comprising (but not limited to) water, acid, solvent, levulinic acid, formic acid, and some “soluble tars” are advanced to the extraction stage of the process. Extraction In the extraction stage of the process, the liquid stream is mixed with an extraction solvent stream. The preferred extraction solvent dissolves levulinic acid more effectively than the other products in the liquid stream. The preferred solvent does not dissolve significantly into the water phase. Extraction configurations are preferably multi-stage and continuous, as described in Perry's Chemical Engineering Handbook. The extraction system may be in a vertical column, preferably in which the fluids are contacted in a counter current fashion. The extraction system may be a KARR® (KMPS, Inc.) or SCHEIBEL® column (KMPS, Inc.), a packed column, or a tray-type column. The column may have multiple stages. The extraction system may also be a fractional extraction system. A water-wash may also be conducted on the solvent phase after the extraction solvent has contacted the aqueous reactor composition in the extraction system. The extractions system may be conducted at temperatures from 20-90° C. The extraction system may contain mixing stages. Alternatively, the extraction system may contain one or more mixer-settlers in series that allow extraction of LA form the aqueous reactor composition into the extraction solvent. The mixer-settler system may have multiple stages. A water-wash may also be conducted on the solvent phase after the extraction solvent has contacted the aqueous reactor composition in the mixer-settler extraction system. The mixer-settler extraction system may be conducted at temperatures from 20-90° C. The mixer-settler extraction system may contain one or more mixing stages and one or more settling stages. Suitable extraction solvents include, for example but are not limited to, phenol, 4-methoxyphenol, 2-methoxyphenol, 3-methoxyphenol, 2-sec-butyl phenol, 3-sec-butyl phenol, 4-sec-butyl phenol, 2-t-butyl phenol, 4-t-butyl phenol, 2,4-di-t-butyl phenol, 2,4-di-methoxyphenol, 2-methylphenol, 3-methylphenol, 4-methylphenol, 2,3-xylenol, 2,4-xylenol, 2,5-xylenol, 2,6-xylenol, 3,4-xylenol, or 3,5-xylenol, 4-hexyl-resorcinol, butylated hydroxyl-toluene (BHT), 2,5-dimethoxyphenol, 3,5-dimethoxy phenol, 2,6-dimethoxy phenol, nonylphenol, or mixtures thereof. Additional suitable extraction solvent include, for example but are not limited to, methyl isoamyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, acetophenone, cyclohexanone, isophorone, neopentyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, n-hexanol, n-heptanol, 2-ethyl hexanol, n-octanol, 1-nonanol, 1-undecanol, phenol, 4-methoxyphenol, guaiacol, methylene chloride, methyl isobutyl carbinol, anisole, ethylene glycol di-n-butyl ether, castor oil, 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-pentadecafluorooctanoic acid, 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-pentadecafluorooctanol, 2-ethyl-hexanoic acid, propyl-substituted bisphenols with PDMS linking groups, diethyl carbonate, halogen-substituted phenols or bisphenols, and mixtures thereof. The aqueous raffinate is recycled to the reactor phase, after optional distillation or purification steps to adjust the relative concentrations of solvent, water, and acid in the raffinate. The extract solvent phase contains levulinic acid and formic acid and is progressed to the solvent removal stage of the process. Suitable solvents to extract LA include, for example, polar water-insoluble solvents such as p-methoxy-phenol and 2,4-xylenol/2,5-xylenol mixtures. Such solvents are used generally at room temperature so as not to serve as potential reaction component. Solvent Removal Levulinic acid may be separated from the solvent phase by evaporating or distilling the solvent. Alternatively, the levulinic acid may be crystallized from the solvent phase in a crystallization process. The solvent removal process may be a combination of distillation and crystallization. The recovered solvent may be recycled to the extraction step. The resulting stream of highly concentrated levulinic acid may be advanced for further chemical derivatization or may be further purified in another distillation step such as high vacuum wipe-film-evaporation, crystallization or falling film evaporation. Preferably the levulinic acid stream is kept at a low temperature throughout the solvent removal steps to inhibit the formation of angelica lactone. Mineral Acids Suitable acids used to convert the biomass materials described herein, including sugars, include mineral acids, such as but not limited, to sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, hydrofluoric acid, perchloric acid and mixtures thereof. The invention will be further described with reference to the following non-limiting Examples. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many changes can be made in the embodiments described without departing from the scope of the present invention. Thus the scope of the present invention should not be limited to the embodiments described in this application, but only by embodiments described by the language of the claims and the equivalents of those embodiments.

After the water wash the char was washed with 250 mL of acetone. Moisture Analyzer Mettler Toledo HG63 Halogen Moisture Analyzer Drying Temperature: 125° C. Example 1 2.5 hr Con-Add Into a beaker containing a magnetic stir bar charged 43.25 g (0.24 mol) fructose and 50.08 g deionized water. The beaker was placed on a stir plate to dissolve the fructose. Into a 500 mL four neck round bottom flask containing a magnetic stir bar charged 11.84 g deionized water and 153.35 g (1.00 mol) 64% sulfuric acid. The round bottom flask was situated in a heating mantle and equipped with a thermocouple, condenser, glass stopper and syringe pump tube. The sulfuric acid and water mixture was heated to 90° C. while stirring at a rate of 650 RPM. Once the fructose was all dissolved it was charged into two 60 mL syringes and situated into a syringe pump. Once the acid and water mixture was up to temperature the fructose solution started to be added via the syringe pump. The fructose solution was added over a course of 2.5 hours at a rate of 30.8 mL/hr. The concentration of fructose did not exceed 0.7%, and the concentration of HMF did not exceed 0.4% during the monosaccharide addition into the reactor. After all of the fructose had been added, the reaction was left to react for an additional hour and then was shut down and allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The solids that were formed remained suspended in the reactor during the entire reaction. Once the reaction mixture was cool it was filtered through a glass microfiber 1.1 μm filter paper. The solids were then washed with DI water and acetone. The moisture analyzer was used to determine the amount of solids in the reaction mixture. The results of the experiment showed 57.91 mol % yield of LA, 68.01 mol % yield of FA and an LA to char ratio of 2.18 using HPLC method 3. Example 2 2.5 hr Con-Add The same procedure was followed as in Example 1 with different charged weights and two different feed rates were used to add in the fructose solution. 43.28 g (0.24 mol) fructose and 25.03 g deionized water. 36.86 g deionized water and 153.41 g (1.00 mol) 64% sulfuric acid. For the first 75 minutes of the reaction the syringe pump rate was set to 25.48 ml/hr then for the remaining 75 minutes the syringe pump rate was set to 13.72 mL/hr. The concentration of fructose did not exceed 1%, and the concentration of HMF did not exceed 0.5% during the monosaccharide addition into the reactor.

The round bottom flask was situated in a heating mantle and equipped with a thermocouple, condenser, glass stopper, and a syringe pump inlet. The water, sulfuric acid and cresol mixture was heated to 90° C. while stirring at 500 RPM. Into a 60 mL syringe charged 59.02 g (42 mL) Cornsweet 90. (Corn Sweet 90 is a high-fructose syrup (90% fructose, 8.5% glucose, 1.5% oligiomeric sugars) supplied by Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). It contains 77% solids.) Once the sulfuric acid, water and cresol mixture reached a temperature of 90° C. the cornsweet 90 started to be added to the mixture via a syringe pump at a rate of 16.8 mL/hr. After 2.5 hours, all of the cornsweet 90 had been added to the round bottom flask and the reaction mixture was left to react for an additional hour. After a total reaction time of 3.5 hours the heat was turned off and the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. Once the reaction mixture was cool it was filtered through a 1.1 μm glass microfiber filter. The char was then washed with methanol and DI water and measured using a moisture analyzer. Samples were pulled throughout the reaction and analyzed by HPLC. Reaction observations: After 60 minutes of reaction time there appeared to be a plastic looking film on the surface of the reaction mixture and the mixture itself looked thick. It was not apparent whether or not the magnetic stir bar was still stirring. Once the reaction was filtered it was very clear that the magnetic stir bar had indeed stopped stirring because it was completely encased by a very hard solid substance which had stuck to the bottom of the round bottom flask.
