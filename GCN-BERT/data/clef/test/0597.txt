Step 5: Preparation of (S)-2-(1-(7-fluoro-2-(pyridine-2-yl)quinoline-3-yl)ethyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione
1 g (2.819 mmol) of (S)-2-(1-(2-chloro-7-fluoroquinoline-3-yl)ethyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione prepared in step 4 was dissolved in 1,4-dioxane (5 mL), to which 163 mg (0.141 mmol) of Pd(PPh3)4 and 1.25 g (3.383 mmol) of 2-(tributylstanyl)-pyridine were added, followed by reflux at 100Â° C. for 3 days under argon atmosphere. Water and ethyl acetate were added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction. The extracted organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate, 4/1) to give 500 mg of the target compound (S)-2-(1-(7-fluoro-2-(pyridine-2-yl)quinoline-3-yl)ethyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione as a white solid (1.258 mmol, yield: 91%).
