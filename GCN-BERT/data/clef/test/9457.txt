Step 7: preparation of intermediate methyl 7-[allyloxy-(2-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl-amino]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-4-carboxylate (6g)
In MeOH (72 mL) at 0°C under inert atmosphere was added AcCl (30 mL, 422 mmol). After stirring for 2 h at 0°C then for 30 min at rt, a solution of N-allyloxy-N-(4-cyano-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[4,5-c]pyridin-7-yl)-2-nitro-benzenesulfonamide (6f) in MeOH (36 mL) was added. The mixture was heated at 50°C for 18 h. The solvent was evaporated. The residue was extracted with DCM and washed with a saturated solution of NaHCO3. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The brown oil was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (DCM/acetone 100/0 to 80/20) to give methyl 7-[allyloxy-(2-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl-amino]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-4-carboxylate (6g) (10.77 g, 23.70 mmol, 78%) as a yellow solid.
