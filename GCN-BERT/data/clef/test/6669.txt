FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to the field of sample collection for nucleic acid amplification, particularly to the use of the polymerase chain reaction to amplify nucleic acids. The invention provides methods and kits which can be used to collect cell samples containing nucleic acids by reducing the use of chemicals that may interfere with the polymerase chain reaction. The invention has applications in the long-term storage, recovery and further processing of nucleic acids and is particularly useful in genotyping, diagnostics and forensics applications. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Long-term storage, transport and archiving of nucleic acids on filter paper or chemically modified matrices is a well-known technique for preserving genetic material before the DNA or RNA is extracted and isolated in a form for use in genetic analysis such as PCR. Thus, EP 1563091 (Smith et al, Whatman) relates to methods for storing nucleic acids from samples such as cells or cell lysates. The nucleic acid is isolated and stored for extended periods of time, at room temperature and humidity, on a wide variety of filters and other types of solid support or solid phase media. Moreover, the document describes methods for storing nucleic acid-containing samples on a wide range of solid support matrices in tubes, columns, or multiwell plates. WO 90/03959 (Burgoyne) describes a cellulose-based solid support for the storage of DNA, including blood DNA, comprising a solid matrix having a compound or composition which protects against degradation of DNA incorporated into or absorbed on the matrix. This document also discloses methods for storage of DNA using the solid medium, and for recovery of or in situ use of DNA. U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,345 (Lundin et al.) describes a method of nucleic acid preparation whereby the sample containing cells is lysed to release nucleic acid and the sample is treated with cyclodextrin to neutralize the extractant. The advantage of this system is that conventional detergent removal requires a separation step however with the addition of cyclodextrin to neutralize the detergent it would remove the separation step needed and reduce chance of contamination. U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,562 (Burgoyne) describes a cellulose-based solid medium and method for DNA storage. Method for storage and transport of DNA on the solid medium, as well as methods which involve either (a) the recovery of the DNA from the solid medium or (b) the use of the DNA in situ on the solid medium (for example, DNA sequence amplification by PCR) are disclosed. The method described incorporates a surfactant or detergent on the surface of the solid medium and would require a separate step for the removal of the detergent before PCR is performed as a detergent would interfere with the PCR process. EP 2290099 B1 (Qiagen) describes again a method for processing and amplifying DNA. The method includes the steps of contacting the sample containing DNA to a solid support wherein a lysis reagent is bound to the solid support. The DNA is subsequently treated with a DNA purifying reagent and is purified. WO96/39813 (Burgoyne) describes a solid medium for storing a sample of genetic material and subsequent analysis; the solid medium comprising a protein denaturing agent and a chelating agent. The method described is for chelating agents which are any compound capable of complexing multivalent ions including Group II and Group III multivalent metal ions and transition metal ions. WO 96/18731 (Deggerdal) describes a method of isolating nucleic acid whereby the sample is bound to a solid support and the sample is contacted with a detergent and subsequent steps performed to isolate the nucleic acid. WO 00/53807 (Smith, Whatman) describes a medium for the storage and lysis of samples containing genetic material which can be eluted and analyzed. The medium is coated with a lysis reagent. In addition the medium could be coated with a weak base, a chelating agent, a surfactant and optionally uric acid. WO 99/38962 (Health, Gentra Systems Inc.) describes a solid support with a bound lysis reagent. The lysis reagent can comprise of a detergent, a chelating agent, water and optionally an RNA digesting enzyme. The solid support again would require further steps for purification of the nucleic acid for amplification analysis. Inhibitors of PCR There are significant problems with inhibitory substances or inhibitors interfering with polymerase chain reactions on nucleic acids, including nucleic acids stored or immobilized on solid supports such as cellulose-derived filters. Sources of inhibitors can be the materials and reagents such as detergents that come into contact with samples during processing or nucleic acid purification. These include excess KCl, NaCl and other salts, ionic detergents such as sodium deoxycholate, sarkosyl and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), ethanol and isopropanol, phenol (see Burgoyne WO 90/03959) and others. All users of PCR are likely to be impacted by inhibitors at some time, but the wide range of forensic sample types and variety of sampling conditions encountered make forensic scientists particularly vulnerable. The presence of chemicals that interfere with PCR analysis in samples is well-known and a number of approaches are documented that describe their removal. However, none of these approaches are particularly efficient. In particular the application of samples to solid supports, particularly cellulose-derived materials, increases the problems with PCR inhibition because of the inclusion of potent chemicals such as SDS and chaotropic salts which are typically used to stabilize nucleic acids on the solid support (see Burgoyne WO 90/03959). PCR inhibitors usually affect PCR through interaction with DNA or interference with the DNA polymerase. In a multiplex PCR reaction, it is possible for the different sequences to experience different inhibition effects to varying degrees, leading to a disparity in results. Alternatively, various inhibitors reduce the availability of cofactors (such as magnesium) or otherwise interfere with the interaction of PCR cofactors with the DNA polymerase. Some of the pitfalls of quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, including the effect of inhibitors, are described by Bustin & Nolan (J. Biomolecular Techniques, 2004, 15, 155-166). Current methods for inhibitor removal are often carried out during the DNA purification procedure by binding to single or double stranded DNA covalently linked to a support. However, this is a tedious process and prior art methods have a number of clear disadvantages in terms of cost, complexity and in particular, user time. U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,345 (Lundin et al.) describes a method of nucleic acid preparation whereby the sample containing cells is lysed to release nucleic acid and the sample is treated with cyclodextrin to neutralize the extractant. The advantage of this system is that conventional detergent removal requires a separation step however with the addition of sequestrants such as cyclodextrin to neutralize the detergent it would remove the separation step needed and reduce chance of contamination. WO 2010/066908 (Beckers et al.,) describes the use of cyclodextrins to improve the specificity, sensitivity and/or yield of PCR. The method claimed is an amplification reaction which is performed in a reaction mixture comprising at least one cyclodextrin and performing the amplification reaction on said reaction. Alternative methods involve the binding of nucleic acids in the presence of chaotropic agents such that DNA binds to silica or glass particles or glass beads. This property was used to purify nucleic acid using glass powder or silica beads under alkaline conditions. Typical chaotropic agents include guanidinium thiocyanate or guanidinium hydrochloride and recently glass beads have been substituted with glass containing minicolumns. While the chaotropic agent may neutralize the interference of the detergent on the PCR process, the chaotropic agent itself may reduce the efficiency of PCR amplification. Wang et al. (Enzyme Microbiology Technology, 1990) describes a method of recovering protein from a bacteria by exposing E. coli to certain combinations of guanidine and Triton X-100 in a solution. It was noted that neither of the chemicals alone and at low concentrations extracts more than 10% of intracellular protein however together were able to release over 50% overall protein. U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,259 (Schleicher & Schuell Inc.) describes a method for the collection and storage of nucleic acids by coating an absorbent material with a solution containing from 0.5M to 2.0M chaotropic salt and allowed to dry. Other ingredients can be added to the invention in order to enhance lysis or disruption of intact cells, bacteria and viruses which include anionic, cationic or zwitterionic surfactants, such as Tween 20 or Triton X-100. Given the wide range of PCR inhibitor-laden sample types and the options available for handling them, a multifaceted approach is the best solution for amplification failure. There is a need to reduce any potential PCR inhibitors used in the nucleic acid collection process wherein the nucleic acid is immobilized on a solid support and thereby improve PCR amplification. The present invention addresses this problem and provides methods and kits which can be used for the collection of nucleic acids using solid supports, particularly cellulose-derived supports.

Chemicals and Materials Used A list of the chemicals and their sources is given below: 31-ETF paper was obtained from GE Healthcare UK Limited; Guanidinium thiocyanate (Sigma-Aldrich G9277) Triton X100 (Sigma-Aldrich T8787) Sterile water (Sigma W4502). Coating tray Glass Dipping tray Mueller-Hinton-agar plates (“ready to use” plates of mibius—P05007A contain the agar of Oxoid—CM0337) Sterile Rotilabo—swabs (EH 12.1 of Roth) Sterile petri plates 80 mm 7 mm Harris Uni-core punch, 1.2 mm (Sigma, Catalogue number Z708860-25ea, lot 3110); Forceps Positive 31-ETF control from previous lots of FTA®-treated paper TSB (Oxoid Tryptone Soy Broth, Art-Nr. CM0129)—150 ml in Erlenmeer flask for culture suspension. 95% and 70% Ethyl alcohol Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923 strain) Measuring ruler Experimental Results ETF paper was coated in a mixture of Guanidine Thiocyanate and Triton X100 using a hand dipping technique. Several mixtures of various molar concentrations of Guanidine Thiocyanate: Triton X100 was prepared. An example of the preparation method used to produce the mixture of Guanidine Thiocyanate: Triton X100 was as follows: For a 0.5M:0.5M Guanidine Thiocyanate: Triton X100 solution 32.5 g of Triton X100 was slowly added to 100 mL of dH2O, using a dropping funnel, due to the low solubility of Triton X100 in water the solutions was continuously stirred as the reagent was added to the water. Once the Triton X100 had dissolved 5.908 g of Guanidine Thiocyanate was slowly added and the solution was stirred to ensure a homogenous solution. The ETF paper was dipped into the homogenous solution and allowed to dry. Table 1 below shows the concentrations and weight of Guanidine Thiocyanate and Triton X100 used in the different sample preparations. TABLE 1 Weight of Guanidine Thiocyanate:Triton X100 Weight of Triton X100 Thiocyanate used in molar concentrations used in grams grams 0.5M 32.5 5.908 0.4M 26.0 4.726 0.3M 19.5 3.544 0.2M 13.0 2.363 0.1M 6.5 1.181 0.01M 0.65 0.118 The coated ETF paper samples were measured for the zone of inhibition (ZOI). A visible zone of inhibition, described as the area encompassing the punch where bacterial growth is inhibited, is used to assess the anti-microbial action of the FTA treated paper. A day before the ZOI test the Staphylococcus aureus suspension was prepared in a 150 mL simple concentrates Tryptone Soy Broth. The culture suspension flask was incubated at 37° C. after the inoculation 18±2. Three punches were taken from each individual ETF treated sample. The 7 mm punch was rinsed with 95% EtOH after each punch was taken. The punches were placed in a sterile plate. The negative control was an untreated ETF paper. A sample from a previous lot of ETF treated paper that produced a well-defined ZOI was used as the positive control. A germ count was performed for a growth confirmation of the culture suspension. The culture suspension had a minimum of 108 CFU/mL for the test to count. The culture suspension was applied on to a single agar plate with a sterile swab. For each tested sample a minimum of 3 plates were prepared. Using forceps and aseptic technique, the paper punches were placed onto the appropriate Mueller-Hinton agar plate—each plate contained a positive and a negative sample, along with 3 punches of the same sample paper. The plates were incubated in an aerobic incubator at 37° C. and were examined after 16 to 18 hours of incubation and a second time when necessary. The ZOI was calculated using a ruler to measure the diameter (including the 7 mm disc) of each zone of complete inhibition to the nearest whole millimeter. The area showing no macroscopically visible growth is defined as the end point. The results showing the ZOI of ETF coated with varying concentrations of Guanidine Thiocyanate and Triton X100 are shown in table 2 and table 3 below.

A calibration curve of concentration versus conductivity yielded an R2 of 0.9945. Using the data from the conductivity experiment the concentration of guanidine present on the hybrid substrates was inferred.
