METHOD OF MANUFACTURING A BODY ADHERING ABSORBENT ARTICUE ORIENTATED IN THE CROSS-MACHINE DIRECTION WITH REDUCED CURE FIEUD OF THE INVENTION This disclosure relates to methods of manufacturing a body adhering absorbent article orientated in the cross-machine direction with little or no curl. Various methods of constructing individual body adhering absorbent articles are described that reduce or eliminate the amount of residual stretch present in the shell where components are attached. BACKGROUND Several methods have been proposed for making body adhering absorbent articles. The body adhering absorbent articles generally consist of components which are laminated to an elastic shell, which is generally in a tensioned state during the assembly process, to form a composite web of individual absorbent articles. When the discrete body adhering absorbent articles are die cut from the composite web the individual articles curl toward the elasticized shell material in the areas where it has been attached to the components as a result of residual stretch present in the shell material in the laminated regions. Curling of a body adhering absorbent article is undesirable because it may interfere with peel strip removal, attachment to the body and the ability of the article to stay attached to the body. Curling of the product in the absorbent area may also interfere with the fit and gasketing of the product. Products which curl are also more difficult to convert, fold, and package increasing the level of defects, and machine downtime. OBJECT OF THE INVENTION It is the object of the present invention to substantially overcome or ameliorate one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art, or at least provide a useful alternative. SUMMARY It has now been discovered that curl of a body adhering absorbent article may be reduced or eliminated by selectively reducing or eliminating the shell elastic tension in regions where components of the body adhesive absorbent article, such as an adhesive transfer layer component or an absorbent article component, are to be attached to form the composite body adhering absorbent article web.

DEFINITIONS It should be noted that, when employed in the present disclosure, the terms ‘‘comprises,” “comprising,” and other derivatives from the root term “comprise” are intended to be open-ended terms that specify the presence of any stated features, elements, integers, steps, or components, and are not intended to preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, elements, integers, steps, components, or groups thereof. “Absorbent structure” refers to the central fluid handling portion of an absorbent article and may include but is not limited to one or more of the following components: cellulose fluff, superabsorbent material, coform, absorbent sponge material, surge material, or wicking material but does not Include a topsheet or backsheet. “Absorbent component” may include but is not limited to one or more of the following components: an absorbent structure, as defined above, a fluid pervious topsheet, a fluid impervious backsheet, or attachment adhesive. As used herein, the term “adhesive transfer layer” generally refers to an adhesive region of the body adhering absorbent article that facilitates adhesion of the article to a user. In certain preferred embodiments the adhesive transfer layer comprises a lower peel strip, construction adhesive, a body attachment adhesive, a nonwoven carrier and an upper peel strip. As used herein, the term “attach” and its derivatives refer to the joining, adhering, connecting, bonding, sewing together, or the like, of two elements. Two elements will be considered to be attached together when they are integral with one another or attached directly to one another or indirectly to one another, such as when each is directly attached to intermediate elements. “Attach” and its derivatives include permanent, releasable, or a refastenable attachment. In addition, the attachment can be completed either during the manufacturing process or by the end wearer. As used herein, “body-facing” means that surface or side of the article which is intended to be disposed toward or placed adjacent to the body of the wearer during ordinary use. The term “garment-facing” means that surface or side that is on the opposite side of the article from the body-facing surface or side. The garment-facing surface is an outward surface of the article and is intended to be disposed to face away from the wearer's body during ordinary use. The garment-facing surface is generally arranged to face toward or placed adjacent to the wearer's undergarments or clothing when the article is worn. As used herein, the term “connected” is intended to mean directly connected and indirectly connected. By directly connected, it is intended that the connected elements are in contact with one another or affixed to one another. By indirectly connected, it is intended that one or more intervening or intermediate elements are between the two elements which are secured or “connected” together. The intervening elements may be affixed. As used herein, the terms “elastomeric,” “elastic,” “eiasticized,” and “elastically” generally refer to that property of a material or composite by virtue of which it tends to recover its original size and shape after removal of a force causing a deformation. An elastomeric material is an extendable material having recovery properties. Suitably, an elastically extensible material can be elongated to at least 25% of its relaxed original length (percent elongation refers to the increase in the original length of the untensioned material. i.e., 0% refers to the original length of the untensioned material) in the direction of an applied biasing force, and which will recover, upon release of the applied force, at least 10% of its elongation. It is generally preferred that the elastomeric material or composite be capable of being elongated by from at least about 25% of its relaxed original length (i.e., an increase of 25% from its untensioned length) to about 200% of its relaxed original length, for example preferably from at least about 50 to about 100% of its relaxed original length. As used herein, the phrase “orientated in the cross-machine direction” refers generally to the orientation of the manufactured absorbent article. For example, with reference to FIG. 5, where the longest dimension 94 of the absorbent article is orientated substantially perpendicular to the direction of travel of the web 30, the absorbent article is said to be manufactured in the cross-machine direction and the absorbent article is said to be “orientated in the cross-machine direction.” Conversely, where the longest dimension of the absorbent article is orientated substantially parallel to the direction of travel of the web. the absorbent article is said to be manufactured in the “machine direction,” or “MD.” “Untensioned” as used herein to describe a web of material does not mean lacking all tension. In order to handle and process moving webs, some moderate amount of tension is needed to hold the web or material in place. Accordingly, an “untensioned” web or material, as used herein, is under enough tension to process the material, but less than that required to cause substantial deformation (e.g., necking) of the material. DETAILED DES CRIPTION Generally, the present disclosure relates to methods of manufacturing a body adhering; absorbent article orientated in the cross-machine direction with little or no curl. Various methods of constructing individual body adhering absorbent articles are described that reduce or eliminate the amount of residual stretch present in the shell where components, such as an absorbent article or an adhesive transfer layer, Eire attached. Eliminating curl is important for facilitating use of the body adhering absorbent article, particularly in the regions of the article that are adhered to the user. By eliminating curl, both the fit and the function of the body adhering absorbent article may be improved. Now with reference to FIG. 1, one embodiment of a body adhering absorbent article 20 is illustrated. Body adhering article 20 comprises body adhering shell 29, and an absorbent article component 40. The composition of the body adhering shell 29 may be varied depending upon the method of manufacturing. For example, as described in more detailed below, where the method of manufacturing comprises selectively activating a web by treating one or more selected regions of the web to increase the regions stretchability, the web of shell material may comprise a latent elastic laminate that upon activation may suitably be stretched by at least about 25%, or at least about 100%, or at least about 200%, and may suitably recover at least about 5%, or at least about 15%, or about 25% of the stretched length. Other suitable shell materials are discussed below. The body adhering shell 29 further comprises a body adhesive, for example an adhesive transfer layer (ATI.,) 32. A preferred configuration of the ATT., 32 is shown in FIG. 2. In this embodiment the ATL 32 is configured with a left and right portion 32a and 32b respectively and consists of lower peel strip 36b, construction adhesive 33, body attachment adhesive 34, nonwoven carrier 35, and upper peel strip 36a. The construction adhesive 33 may be, for example, Easymelt 34-5610 (Nation Starch Chemical Co., Bridgewater, NJ), the body attachment adhesive 34 may be, for example, RMS gel 4a (Biomed Sciences, Inc., Allentown, PA), the nonwoven carrier 35 may be, for example, rayon/polyester Spunlaee nonwoven (Biomed Sciences, Inc., Allentown, PA) and the peel strip 36 may be, for example, 24KSA final release paper (Tekkote Co., Leonia, NJ). In one embodiment an All. 32 comprising a pee! strip 36, body attachment adhesive 34, and nonwoven carrier 35 may be manufactured by providing a web of nonwoven carrier 35, providing a web of peel strip 36a, applying a body attachment adhesive 34 to the peel strip 36a and curing the adhesive 34, for example by treating the adhesive 34 with ultraviolet light. Once the adhesive 34 is cured it is laminated to a nonwoven carrier 35, In a preferred embodiment the body attachment adhesive layer is narrower than the peel strip 36a and may he narrower than peel strip 36a and nonwoven carrier 35. This results in the formation of a user grasping section or finger tab 37 on the lateral side inside edges of ATI, webs 32a and 32b. In a particularly preferred embodiment the ATL web 32 is made in a multi-wide configuration, slit into individual lanes and wound onto cores. In another embodiment an ATL 32 comprising a lower peel strip 36b, construction adhesive 33, nonwoven carrier 35, body attachment adhesive 34, and upper peel strip 36a may be manufactured by providing a web of lower peel strip 36b, providing a web of nonwoven carrier 35, applying a construction adhesive 33 to the nonwoven carder 35 and laminating the nonwoven carrier 35 and construction adhesive 33 to the lower peel strip 36b. A web of upper peel strip 36a is provided and a body attachment adhesive 34 is applied to upper peel ship 36a and cured. The upper peel strip 36a with cured body attachment adhesive 34 is laminated to the nonwoven carrier 35, construction adhesive 33, and lower peel strip 36b laminate. In still another embodiment an ATT, 32 comprising a lower peel strip 36b, construction adhesive 33, nonwoven carrier 35, body attachment adhesive 34, and upper peel strip 36a may be manufactured by providing webs of lower peel strip 36b and nonwoven carrier 35 which are fed into the process, applying construction adhesive 33 to the nonwoven carrier 35 and laminating the nonwoven carrier 35 and construction adhesive 33 composite to the lower peel strip 36b. A web of upper peel strip 36a is provided and discrete patches of body attachment adhesive 34 are applied to upper peel strip 36a and cured. The upper peel strip 36a with cured discrete patches of body attachment adhesive 34 is laminated to the nonwoven carrier 35, construction adhesive 33, and lower peel strip 36b laminate. In this embodiment the discrete patches of body attachment adhesive layer result in the formation of lateral direction user grasping sections 3/. ATL lower peel strip 36b and construction adhesive 33 may or may not he needed depending on the method of mating the body adhering absorbent article. In another embodiment an ATL 32 comprising a lower peel strip 36b, construction adhesive 33, nonwoven carrier 35, body attachment adhesive 34, and upper peel strip 36a may be manufactured by providing webs of nonwoven carrier 35 and peel strip 36a which are fed into the process. The peel strip 36a is c-folded over onto itself forming user grasping section 37. Body attachment adhesive 34 is applied to the peel strip 36a, cured and laminated to the nonwoven carrier 35, construction adhesive, and lower peel strip 36b laminate, In addition to the shell material 30 and ATL 32, the body adhering absorbent article may comprise an absorbent article component 40, which is generally attached to the first side of the shell material 30. The attachment may be in a permanent manner, meaning that the absorbent article component 40 is generally intended not to be removable by the wearer of the article 20. Alternatively, the absorbent article component 40 may be constructed to be removable by the wearer, meaning that the absorbent article component 40 may be removed and replaced with another absorbent article component 40 by the wearer of the article 20, or be replaced with nothing at all. In some aspects, when the absorbent article component 40 is attached to the shell material 30 in a permanent manner, meaning that the absorbent article component 40 is not intended to be removed by the wearer, various bonding means can be used, such as a construction adhesive 33 for example. Examples of useable construction adhesives 33 include any adhesive which will effectively hold the absorbent article component 40 in place, so as not to be separated from the shell material 30. Commercially available construction adhesives usable in the present invention include, for example, Rextac™ adhesives available from Huntsman Polymers, Houston, ΤΧ. Other means may be used to hold the absorbent article component 40 to the shell material 30 including bonding techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, pressure bonds, adhesive bonds, cohesive bonds, thermal bonds, ultrasonic bonds, embossing, crimping, entangling, fusing, hook and loop, or the like, and combinations thereof. Where the absorbent article component 40 is preferably removably attached, the absorbent article component 40 is held in place on the shell material 30 by a means which will allow the wearer to remove the absorbent article component 40. One such means of holding the absorbent article component 40 is by using a pressure sensitive adhesive. Suitable pressure sensitive adhesives include, but are not limited to, any commercially available pressure sensitive adhesive. Examples of suitable pressure sensitive adhesives usable to removably hold the absorbent article component 40 in place on the shell materia! 30 include pressure sensitive adhesives available from National Starch, Bridgewater, NJ. In certain embodiments it may be advantageous for the absorbent article component 40 to have a backsheet 42 and more preferably a fluid impervious backsheet. The backsheet can serve to provide liquid impermeability to the absorbent article component 40, such that any fluids entering the absorbent structure 24 will not flow through to the clothing of a wearer. One example of a commercially available fluid impervious backsheet is the ΧΡ-3473η baffle available from Huntsman Packaging Corporation, Houston, ΤΧ. The absorbent structure 24 may also comprise wicking layers 43a and 43b, which may be formed from meltbiown microfiber such as the 50 gsm meltbiown fibers commercially available from Yuhan-K'imberly Ltd., Korea. The absorbent article component 40 further comprises an absorbent layer 44, intake layer 45 and topsheet 46. The absorbent layer 44 may contain one or more layers of absorbent materials, such as fibrous materials and/or superabsorbent materials for example. Each of the layers can contain similar materials or different materials. Materials that can be used to form the absorbent layer 44 include those materials conventionally used in absorbent articles and includes materials, such as, for example, cellulose, wood pulp fluff, rayon, cotton, and meltbiown polymers such as polyester, polypropylene or coform. Coform is a meltbiown air-formed combination of meltbiown polymers, such as polypropylene, and absorbent staple fibers, such as cellulose. A desired material is wood pulp fluff, for it is low in cost, relatively easy to form, and has good absorbency. In a preferred embodiment the body adhering absorbent article 20 comprises a peel strip 36, which may extend in the lateral direction 77 beyond the extent of the body attachment adhesive 34 forming a user grasping section also know as a finger tab 37. The presence of finger tab 37 allows the user to grasp the peel strip by placing their thumb under the unattached peel strip region and grasping the peel strip in the user grasping section 37 between the thumb and forefinger. The user of the product applies a peeling force to remove the anterior and posterior peel strips 36. Referring to FIG. 3, one method of manufacturing absorbent article components 40 is illustrated. The process has a machine direction 76 and a cross-machine direction 77. The process consists of assembling an absorbent structure web 51, die cutting individual absorbent structures 24 from web 51, adhesively laminating individual absorbent structures 24 between webs of topsheet material 46 and hacksbeet material 42 forming composite web 52 and die cutting individual absorbent article components 40 from composite web 52. Absorbent article components 40 have an anterior portion 84 and a posterior portion 85. Anterior portion 84 is designed to align with the anterior of the wearer in use and posterior portion 85 is designed to align with the posterior of the wearer in use. Absorbent structure web 51 may contain one or more layers of absorbent materials, such as fibrous materials and/or superabsorbent materials for example. Each of the layers can contain similar materials or different materials. In a particular embodiment absorbent structure web 51 may be formed by providing an intake layer web 45, creating apertures 48 through intake layer 45, delivering an absorbent web 44 and attaching it to the garment side 89 of Intake layer 45, delivering one or more layers of distribution material 43 and attaching the one or more layers to the intake web absorbent web composite forming the completed absorbent structure composite web 51. Absorbent article composite web may be formed by delivering a series of longitudinally spaced absorbent structures 24 orientated such that the longitudinal center line of each absorbent structure 24 is parallel with the machine direction and where the posterior portions 85 of each absorbent structure 24 in the series are adjacent to the anterior portion 84 of the subsequent absorbent structures 24; delivering a web of backsheet material 42, in a particular embodiment construction adhesive may be applied to the body facing surface of backsheet web 42; and delivering a web of topsheet material 46, in a particular embodiment construction adhesive 33 may be applied to topsheet web 46. The series of absorbent structures 24 are then sandwiched between and attached to at least one of the backsheet web 42 or topsheet web 46 completing the formation of the absorbent article composite web 52. In the preferred embodiment of absorbent article component absorbent structure 24 is not coextensive with the region of topsheet 46 and backsheet 42 adjacent to the peripheral edge of absorbent structure 24 which is laminated together such that when the absorbent article component 40 is cut from web 52 a peripheral edge is formed devoid of absorbent structure 24. The composite web 52 may then be cut to form. individual absorbent components 40. In she preferred embodiment absorbent structures 24 are not coextensive with topsheet layer 46 and hacksheet layer 42 but have a peripheral edge 54 which seals and contains absorbent structure within a backsheet 42 topsheet 46 Topsheet 46 should be able to manage different body excretions depending on the type of product. In feminine care products, often the body-side liner or topsheet 46 must be able to handle menses and urine. In certain embodiments the topsheet 46 may include a layer constructed of any operative material, and may be a composite material. For example, the body-side liner or body-contacting layer can include a woven fabric, a nonwoven fabric, a polymer film, a film-nonwoven fabric laminate or the like, as well as combinations thereof. Suitable construction adhesives include, for example, Rextac™ adhesives, as well as adhesives available from Bostik Findley, Inc, Wauwatosa, WI. Backsheet web 42 may be a fluid impermeable web. Alternately backsheet web 42 can be a fluid pervious web. Backsheet web 42 may, for example, include a polymeric film, a woven fabric, a nonwoven fabric or the like, as well as combinations or composites thereof. For example, the backsheet 42 may include a polymer film laminated to a woven or nonwoven fabric. In a particular feature, tire polymer film can be composed of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester or the like, as well as combinations thereof. With reference to FIG. 4, manufacture of the body adhering absorbent article continues with delivery of the web of a shell material 30 having a body facing side 88 and a garment facing side 89. As noted previously, the shell material 30 can include a polymeric film, a woven fabric, a nonwoven fabric, a foam or the like, as well as combinations or composites thereof. In some aspects, shell material may include a laminate structure, such as a polymer film laminated to a woven or nonwoven fabric. The exact composition of the shell material 30 may vary depending on the method of manufacture, as described more fully below. In certain embodiments the shell web 30 is corona treated to improve its adhesion properties. Alternately shell material 30 can be pre-corona treated. A web of prelaminated composite 32 referred to as an “Adhesive Transfer Layer” or ATL comprising a carrier sheet 35, body adhesive 34, and peel strip 36 is provided and adhered to the web of shell material 30 to form a shell composite web 53. Manufacture continues with the preparation of the sheii composite web 53 for attachment of absorbent component 40. An initial die cut is made in composite web 53 to remove a portion of material that will be covered by absorbent article component 40. In an alternate embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 4, die cutting can be eliminated if absorbent articles 40 are positioned within or coextensive with individual body adhering shell 29. An attachment means, such as an adhesive 33, is then applied to the shell composite web 53. In other embodiments the attachment means may be applied to the composite absorbent web 52. Attachment means can be eliminated if the absorbent article component 40 has an attachment means for attaching it to body adhering shell 29. The attachment means can be a one part system, e.g., construction adhesive 33 for attaching absorbent article component 40 to body adhering shell 29. Alternately attachment means can be a two part attachment system, not shown, such as a hook and loop fastener, cohesive, snaps, buttons, etc. where one part of the two part attachment means is located on body adhering shell 29 and the second part of attachment means 21 is located on absorbent article component 40. Next individual absorbent article components 40 are delivered rotated 90 degrees and attached to body facing surface 88 of composite web 53 such that barrier layer 42 of absorbent article component 40 is adjacent to body facing surface 88 of composite web 53. In this embodiment construction adhesive 33 is used to make the attachment. One skilled in the art however, will appreciate that “attach” refers to any method of joining, adhering, connecting, bonding, sewing together, or the like, of two elements. Two elements will be considered to be attached together when they are integral with one another or attached directly to one another or indirectly to one another, such as when each is directly attached to intermediate elements and include permanent, releasable, or a refasten able attachment. Manufacture continues by die cutting individual body adhering absorbent articles 20. The body adhering absorbent articles 20 may be manufactured in either a nested or non-nested pattern. Nested patterns are particularly preferred because they reduce the amount of raw7 material necessary to make an article. FIG. 5 illustrates a web of non -nested body adhering absorbent articles 20 having anterior portion 88 with maximum width dimension 90 and posterior portion 89 with machine directional maximum width dimension 91. Articles 20 have a cross-machine directional dimension 94 which is a measurement of article 20 taken along the line passing through the mid-points of lines 90 and 91. Composite web 53 has a cross-machine directional width dimension 93 that is greater than or equal to dimension 94. The machine directional length of composite web material 53 needed to mate one non-nested article 20 is equal to dimension 98. The area of composite web material 53 needed to make one non-nested article 20 is equal to dimension 98 multiplied by dimension 93. For example, article 20 shown in FIG. 5 has a dimension 98 of 132 mm and a dimension 93 of 314 mm. The area of composite web 53 needed to make one article 20 with this non-nested pattern is 41,448 mint A configuration is described to be “nested” if the area of composite web material 53 needed to make one article 20 is less than dimension 90 multiplied by dimension 94. In this example dimension 90 equals 126 mm and dimension 94 equals 302 mm equaling an area of 38,052 mm2. FIG. 6 illustrates one nested pattern of body adhering absorbent articles 20. In this embodiment the machine directional length of composite web 53 necessary to make one article 20 is equal to dimension 98 and the cross directional width of composite web material 53 needed to make one article 20 is equal to dimension 93. The area of web material 35 needed to make one nested article 20 is equal to dimension 98 multiplied by dimension 93. For example, in this drawing dimension 98 is 67 mm and dimension 93 is 379 mm. The area of composite web 35 necessary to make one article 20 is 25,393 mm2 which is a reduction of 39% versus the non-nested configuration shown in FIG. 5. FIG. 7 illustrates yet another completely nested design of body adhering absorbent structure 40, The advantage of a completely nested design is that there is no trim waste to dispose of. In this embodiment the machine directional length of composite material 53 necessary to make one article 20 is equal to dimension 98 and the cross directional width of composite web material 53 needed to make one article 20 is equal to dimension 93. The area of web material 53 needed to make one nested article 20 is equal to dimension 98 multiplied by dimension 93. For example, in this drawing dimension 98 is 77 mm and dimension 93 is 303 mm. The area of composite web 53 necessary to make one article 29 is 23,331 mm2 which is a reduction of 44% versus the non-nested configuration shown in FIG. 5. Now with reference to FIG. 8, one cross-machine direction method of making a body adhering absorbent article 20 having reduced curl is illustrated. In this embodiment a web of shell material 30 stretchable in the cross-machine direction 77 is provided. Components, such as adhesive transfer layers 32a and 32b are attached to the peripheral left and right edges, 70 and 72 respectively, of the shell material 30, while other components, such as an absorbent article 40 are attached to the interior portion of the shel l material. Because the shell material is stretchable primarily in the cross-machine direction and since the web is not under cross-machine direction tension components that are attached to the shell weh will have little or no residual stretch in the attachment regions. As a result curl is reduced or eliminated in the individual body adhering absorbent article 20. The cross-machine stretchable web of shell material 30 is preferably stretchable from about 50 to about 200% in the cross-machine direction and less than 20% stretchable in the machine direction and more preferably from about 0 to about 10% stretchable in the machine direction. Suitable cross-machine, stretchable web shell material include, for example, laminate materials that include at least one elastic film foam, woven, or non woven layer and a CD extensible nonwoven web such as a necked nonwoven web. The nonwoven web is preferably a spunbond web, or a laminate which includes a spunbond web. The nonwoven web is stretched or elongated in a machine direction producing necking of the web in the cross-machine direction. While in an elongated or necked position, tire web is bonded to an elastic sheet to form a nonwoven laminate material that is stretchable in a direction parallel to the direction of necking of the web, and which partly or fully recovers when the stretching force is removed. The necked nonwoven web is thermally bonded to the elastic core layer. Other bonding processes may also be used including, but not limited to, pressure bonding, adhesive bonding and ultrasonic welding. Components such as an ATI. 32 are attached to the peripheral regions of the cross-machine stretchable shell web 30. The components may be attached using any method known in the art, for example, pressure bonding, adhesive bonding, thermal bonding and ultrasonic welding. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 8, webs of AIT, 32 are attached using construction adhesive 33 applied to the peripheral edges 70 and 72 of the cross-machine stretchable web shell of material 30. Once the components are attached to form a composite web 53, individual body adhering absorbent articles are die cut from the composite web 53. Upon cutting, the shell material will have little or no residual tension thus reducing or eliminating the curl in the relaxed untensioned body adhering absorbent article 20. With reference to FIG. 9, another embodiment for manufacturing a body adhering absorbent article in the cross-machine direction is illustrated. As shown in FIG. 9, a web of shell material. 30 is mechanically activated by mechanically treating one or more selected regions 62 of the shell web 30 in one or more selected directions, whereby the stretchability in the selected direction of the material can be controlled and substantially increased in the region(s) that have been mechanically treated. For example, the elasticity of a material with an initial stretch of from about 0 to about 25% in the cross-machine direction can be increased to about 50 to about 200% stretch with machine treatment that is orientated in the machine direction. By mechanically treating the shell material 30 an elastic web material having zoned stretching in the cross-machine direction may be produced. For example, by mechanically treating the web in a direction parallel to the machine direction, treated regions or zones of material 62 are produce, such that when a tensioning force is applied in the cross-machine direction the treated zones 62 will stretch or exhibit increased stretching, while unmachined, untreated zones 60 display little or no additional stretch. Accordingly, a web having mechanically activated and nonactivated zones may be prepared as known in the art, for example as described in US Patent Nos. 4,834,741 and 5,366,782, the contents of which are incorporated herein in a manner consistent with the present disclosure. For example a web, such as a polyolefin apertured web or a low density polyethylene film, both of which are substantially inelastic, is longitudinally passed through rolls 64 of ring-rolling apparatus illustrated in FIG. 9 to make a web having activated and nonactivated zones. Roils 64 consist of bands of teeth which are separated by a uniform distance from one another. The distance between the bands of teeth can be varied to create activated and nonactivated zones having varying widths and spacing. Ring-rolling of the shell web 30 incrementally stretches and thereby plastically deforms a plurality of the beam-like elements in the transverse direction. The stretching of the beam-like elements occurs incrementally across the width of the web (transverse direction) as the film is constrained at the tips of the teeth and is stretched an amount that is proportional to the pitch and the engagement. As the engagement depth of the rolls 64 is increased, the incremental stretching and the plastic deformation of the beam-like elements are increased. In a preferred embodiment the shell web would be a composite of outer facings webs such as spunbond, SM, SMS, or BCW that yield when passed through the ring rolling apparatus and the center core layer is an elastic film or elastic nonwoven that stretches when passing through the apparatus. After passing through the zoned ring rolling apparatus the web retracts and is eiasticized in the regions where the non woven has been yielded. Once activated regions 62 and nonactivated regions 60 have been formed, components such as an ATL 32 or absorbent components 40 are attached to the nonactivated regions 60 of the web. The components may be attached using any method known in the art, for example, adhesive bonding, thermal bonding and ultrasonic welding. Once the components are attached to form a composite web 53, individual body adhering absorbent articles 20 are die cut front the composite web. As a result of this configuration the components are laminated to nonactivated, non-stretchable, portions of the web so that when the individual body adhering absorbent articles 20 are die cut from the composite web there will be little or no residual stretch in the shells laminated regions where the ATL components 32 or absorbent article components 40 are attached, thereby reducing or eliminating curl in the individual body adhering absorbent article 20. Turning now to FIG. 10 another embodiment for manufacturing a body adhering absorbent article orientated in the cross-machine direction is illustrated. As shown in FIG. 10, a web 30 is activated by treating one or more selected regions 62 of the web 30 in one or more selected directions, whereby the stretchability in the selected direction of the material can be controlled and substantially increased in the selectively treated region(s). For example, the elasticity of a materi al with an initial stretch of from about 0 to about 25% in the cross-machine direction can be increased to about 100 to about 200% stretch with selective treatment, that is orientated in the machine direction. By selectively treating the shell materia! 30 in the machine direction, an elastic web material having zoned stretching in the cross-machine direction may be produced. For example, by thermally treating the web in a direction parallel to the machine direction, treated regions or zones of material 62 are produced, such that when a tensioning force is applied in the cross-machine direction the treated zones 62 will stretch or exhibit increased stretching, while untreated zones 60 display little or no additional stretch. Accordingly, in one embodiment tire web of shell material 30 may comprise a latent elastic laminate that upon activation may suitably be stretched in the cross-machine direction 77 by at least about 25%, or at least about 100%, or at least about 200%, and may suitably recover at least about 5%, or at least about 15%, or about 25'% of the stretched length. The latent elastic laminate materials may have a basis weight between about 2 and about 60 grams per square meter (gsm), or between about 5 and about 30 gsm, or between about 5 and about 15 gsm. Suitable latent elastic materials include, for example, the latent elastic laminate described in US Patent No. 7,820,001, the contents of which are incorporated herein in a manner consistent with the present disclosure. In a preferred embodiment the latent elastic laminate is formed as a multi-segmented film web having heat activatable regions or zones where one or more of the segments within the multi-segmented film comprises an elastic segment, any additional layers laminated thereto desirably comprise a CD extensible material or fabric. In this regard, the additional layer or layers can comprise, as examples, extensible nonwoven materials (e.g., ereped nonwovens or nonwovens comprising highly crimped fibers), necked nonwovens, meshed fabrics, loosely woven fabrics, elastic composite materials and/or other like materials. Desirably the fabric comprises one or more layers of thermoplastic fibers which are elastic, inheren tly extensible or which have been treated so as to be become extensible and/or elastic and which also have a cloth-like hand and drape. The composition of the thermoplastic polymer may be selected as desired to achieve a material having the desired physical attributes such as, for example, elasticity, hand, tensile strength, cost and so forth. Further, the outer nonwoven layer may be treated such as, for example, by embossing, hydroentangling, neck stretching, mechanically softening, printing, anti-static treatment or treated in some other manner in order to achieve desired aesthetics and/or functional characteristics. In one embodiment, to activate the latent elastic laminate, the laminate is heated to at least a softening point of the latent polymer. When the latent polymer softens, the elastic members are able to retract and gather the substrate, thereby resulting in a gathered structure that is elastic. Latent heat activation may be achieved at temperatures between about 70 and about 290°C, or between about 70 and about 200°C, depending largely upon the glass transition temperature of the latent polymer as well as the basis weight of the polymer and the laminate, and also depends upon the dwell time. For example, the iatent heat activation may be achieved at a temperature between about 140 and about 160 ( with a dwell time of about 5 to about 10 seconds, or at a temperature between about 70 and about 160°C with a dwell time of about I to about 10 seconds. Accordingly, in one embodiment a transfer roller feeds the web 30 having heat activatable elastic zones into a heat activation unit. The heat activation unit may comprise, for example, a pair of rolls (two shown in FIG. 30, 66 and 66). The roils are preferably configured to provide zoned heating to the web as it travels through the nip. For example, the roils may be configured to have both heated and unheated regions so that as the web travels through the nip it is either heated on its upper and bottom surface by the heated regions of the rolls or is subjected to little or no heating by the unheated regions of the rolls. Alternatively, the rolls may be uniformly heated but comprise raised elements, that when opposed create a heated nip that selectively activates the web. The distance of web activated, as well as the necessary residence time for heat activation to occur, may be controlled by varying the design and rotational speed of the rollers 66. In certain preferred embodiments upon activation the web of shell material 30 is allowed to retract at ambient temperatures as it passes into and out of the heat activation unit. This retraction can occur after the web travels from a first vacuum conveyor in the healing section to any subsequent conveyor and advantageously to a subsequent vacuum conveyor in the quenching section. After this additional retraction has occurred the web may be cooled on the quench vacuum roli(s) to preserve this retracted state as the web is processed further. During heat activation, generally the web of shell material 30 can be retracted from about 15 to about 55%. Preferably the web of shell materia! 30 can be retracted from about 25 to about 45%. Most preferably the web of shell material 30 can be retracted about 35%. Retraction can occur between one or more of the Toilers 66. After heat activation, components such as an ATL component 32 or an absorbent article component 40 are attached to the inelastic regions 60 of the web. The components may be attached using any method known in the art, for example, adhesive bonding, thermal bonding and ultrasonic welding. Once the components are attached to form a composite web 53, individual body adhering absorbent articles 20 are die cut from the composite web 53. As a result of this configuration the components are laminated to nonactivated, non-stretchable, portions of the web so that when the individual body adhering absorbent articles 20 are die cut from the composite web 53 there will be little or no residual stretch in the shell’s laminated regions which will reduce or eliminate curl in the individual body adhering absorbent articles 20. In an alternative embodiment, individual body adhering absorbent articles 20 may be manufactured as described above, however, die components such as an ATL component 32 or absorbent article component 40 are attached to a shell web 30 having heat activatable elastic zones prior to activation. The components may he attached using any method known in the art, for example, adhesive bonding, thermal bonding and ultrasonic welding. Once the components are attached to form a composite web 53 regions between the components are heat activated. After activation, individual body adhering absorbent articles 20 are die cut from the composite web 53. As a result of this configuration the components are laminated to nonaetivated, non-strefchabie, portions of the web so that when the individual body adhering absorbent articles 20 are die cut from the composite web 53 there will be little or no residual stretch in the shells laminated regions which will reduce or eliminate curl in the individual body adhering absorbent article. In yet another embodiment a body adhering absorbent article 20 may be manufactured using a multi-segmented film weh having alternating elastic and inelastic regions. Exemplary multi-segmented film webs include webs prepared as described in US Application No. 12/649427, filed December 30, 2009, the contents of which arc incorporated herein in a manner consistent with the present disclosure. For example, a multi-segmented film web may be provided having segments that stretch from about 0 to about 25% in tire cross-machine direction 77 and other segments that stretch from about 50 to about 100% in the cross-machine direction 77. Preferably each segment has little or no stretch in the machine direction 76. The segments are preferably arranged such that the periphery of the web comprises segments having from about 50 to about 100%= stretch in tire cross-machine direction, while the interior portion of the weh comprises one or more segments having from about 0 to about 25% stretch in the cross-machine direction 77. Preferably the multi-segmented film is a laminate comprising two or more films and/or fabrics. For example, the multi-segmented 111m may be bonded to a nonwoven web, which may be either a single layer nonwoven web or a multilayer nonwoven laminate that includes at least one layer of a nonwoven weh or multiple nonwoven layers such as, for example, a three layered laminate comprising spunbond/meltblown/spunbond. The particular composition of any additional layers attached to the multi-segmented film may be selected to achieve desired attributes such as, for example, aesthetics, strength, and durability. The multi-segmented film and other fabric(s) can he laminated together by means known to those skilled in the art such as, for example, by pressure bonding, thermal bonding, ultrasonic bonding, adhesive bonding and the like. Where one or more of the segments within the multi-segmented film comprises an elastic segment, any additional layers laminated thereto desirably comprise a CD extensible material or fabric. In this regal'd, the additional layer or layers can comprise, as examples, extensible nonwoven materials (e.g., creped nonwovens or nonwovens comprising highly crimped fibers), necked nonwovens, meshed fabrics, loosely woven fabrics, elastic composite materials and/or other like materials. Desirably the fabric comprises one or more layers of thermoplastic fibers which tire elastic, inherently extensible or which have been treated so as to become extensible and/or elastic and which also have a cloth-like hand and drape. The composition of the thermoplastic polymer may be selected as desired to achieve a material having the desired physical attributes such as, for example, elasticity, hand, tensile strength, cost and so forth. Further, the outer nonwoven layer may be treated such as, for example, by embossing, hydroentangling, neck stretching, mechanically softening, printing, anti-static treatment or treated in some other manner in order to achieve desired aesthetics and/or functional characteristics. Components such as an ATL or an absorbent article are attached to the inelastic regions of the shell web. The components may be attached using any method known in the art, for example, adhesive bonding, thermal bonding and ultrasonic welding. Once the components are attached to form a composite web, individual body adhering absorbent articles tire die cut from the composite web 53. As a result of this configuration the components are laminated to nonactivated, non-stretchable, portions of the web so that when the individual body adhering absorbent articles 20 are die cut from the composite web 53 there will be little or no residual stretch in the shells laminated regions which will reduce or eliminate curl in the individual body adhering absorbent article. Referring to FIG. 11, in still another embodiment a body adhering absorbent article 20 having a segmented shell may be manufactured to reduce curl. As illustrated in FIG. 12, a body adhering absorbent article may be manufactured by delivering two webs of CD stretchable shell material 30a and 30b such that there is a predetermined space between the inboard peripheral edges of the webs. ALT webs 32a and 32b are attached adjacent to the outboard edges of shell webs 30a and 30b. Absorbent article components 40 are then delivered and attached to the inboard peripheral edges of shell webs 30a and 30b forming composite web 53. Individual body adhering absorbent articles 20 are then die cut from the composite web 53. Because the shell material is stretchable primarily in the cross-machine direction and since the web is not under cross-machine direction tension components that are attached to the sheii web 30, the sheii web 30 will have little or no residual stretch in the attachment regions. As a result curl is reduced or eliminated in the individual body adhering absorbent article 20. Referring to FIG. 13, in still another embodiment a body adhering absorbent article 20 having a segmented shell may be manufactured to reduce curl. As illustrated in FIG. 13, a body adhering absorbent article may be manufactured by delivering two webs of activatabie shell material 30a and 30b such that there is a predetermined space between the inboard peripheral edges of the webs. Shell webs 30a and 30b are then passed through an activation process, for example a mechanical activation process such as a ring rolling process previously described. ALT webs 32a and 32b are then attached adjacent to the outboard edges of activated shell webs 30a and 30b. Absorbent article components 40 are then delivered and attached to the inboard peripheral edges of activated shell webs 30a and 30b forming composite web 53. Individual body adhering absorbent articles 20 are then die cut from the composite web 53. Because the activated shell material 30 is stretchable primarily in the cross-machine direction and since the web is not under cross-machine direction tension components that are attached to die activated shell web 30, shell web 30 will have little or no residual stretch in the attachment regions. As a result curl is reduced or eliminated in the individual body adhering absorbent article 20.
