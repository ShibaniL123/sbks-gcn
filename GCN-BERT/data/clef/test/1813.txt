Another embodiment is depicted in Scheme 4, which illustrates the synthesis of the acrylate compounds 3 & 4 in a three-step process. After 28 g HFA and 21.2 g sodium carbonate are mixed well in 20 mL methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), 73.6 g meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA, 75 wt %) dissolved in CH2Cl2 at 0.1 g/ml concentration is added dropwise at a reaction temperature below 15Â° C., and then the reaction is reacted for 4 hours to complete the epoxidation. The reaction mixture is washed with 10 wt % sodium sulfite and then by 10 wt % aqueous sodium bicarbonate. CH2Cl2 is removed by in vacuum rotary evaporation and 30 g product epoxidized hempseed oil fatty acid (EHFA, 96% yield) is obtained.
