Enzymes, namely, alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase have important role in the terminal stages of carbohydrate digestion as well as fat metabolism. Effective inhibitors of these enzymes can slow down the release of sugar in blood after a meal. Hence alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitors are found to be effective in therapy of hyperglycemia -related diseases such as diabetes and obesity. The inhibitors of alpha-glucosidases have potential for broad based therapeutic applications against AIDS and other viral infections, cancer, heart disease, fungal infections etc. A few inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase have been developed as drugs specifically effective against diabetes and are available in the market. But they have certain side effects. They cannot be used in patients with renal problems and they may cause hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal complications. Another important drawback of this therapy is that it is expensive. Hence search for new sources of alpha glucosidase inhibitors is desired for. Plants have been used as source of drugs since ancient times. They still remain a vast reservoir for novel drug molecules. Phytomedicines have popular support owing to their effectiveness, low costs and relatively less side effects. There are several reports and patents exploiting plants for alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity. Present investigation describes plant extracts from commonly available plants, so far unexplored for high alphaglucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activities useful in developing drugs or nutraceuticals or food supplements, effective against different ailments such as diabetes, obesity, cancer, influenza , viral and fungal diseases and many others. To the best of our knowledge, alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activities of these plant extracts have not yet been described. Further, they have certain advantages over currently available commercial drugs; including but not limited to easy availability of plants, resulting in cost effective formulation, wide range of pH stability for inhibition activity that could result in ease of consumption without processing such as encapsulation, low cytotoxicity and higher efficacy even as crude extracts, as compared to marketed drugs such as acarbose.

The inhibitors of alphaglucosidases have been shown to restrict infectivity of viral infections such as HIV AIDS by impairing processing of viral membrane associated glycoproteins (Papandreu et al. 2002 Molecular Pharmacol. 61: 186-193, Lee Ratner 1992 AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses 8: 165-173). Involvement of alphaglucosidase inhibitors in cancer therapy is demonstrated by their role in restricting metastasis (Atsumi et al. 1993 Cancer Res. 53: 4896 - 4899, Hakamata et al. 2006 Appl. Glycosci. 53: 149-154). They are also being pursued for development of treatment for cystic fibrosis (Hakamata et al. 2006 Appl. Glycosci. 53: 149-154). Further, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors have demonstrated activity against fungal infections and influenza (Saito T et al. 2000 J. Vet. Med. Sci. 62: 575-581). Their use is being considered in therapy for chronic heart failure (Node K. 2006 Hypertens. Res. 29: 741-742.) They have also shown potential in development of immunostimulants (US patent no. 7,081,260, Alpha.- Glucosidase inhibitors from a natural source Rao et al. 2006, Oda et al. 2011 Biofactors 37: 31-39).

Brief Description of the Drawings - Not applicable Detailed Description of the Invention Accordingly, the present invention provides a plant-based health protective, promotive and disease preventive extract as well as nutraceutical composition useful against diabetes with alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity wherein the said composition comprises extracts of vegetative and reproductive plant parts, selected from families Menispermaceae, Asteraceae, Nyctaginaceae, Myrtaceae. Although a number of publications and patents describe the hypoglycemic properties of a number of herbal plants in a general manner (as discussed in ‘Prior Art’), very few of them actually explain the nature of active compounds or their mode of action. In the present invention, we specifically studied the inhibitory effects of plant extracts on enzymes like alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase in biochemical, quantifiable assays and compared this inhibition with acarbose, the therapeutic drug currently available in the market. The present invention used the plant extracts at 5-20% (w/v) concentration, and they were extracted in water, methanol or chloroform. Both vegetative and reproductive plant parts, either fresh or oven-dried (30-60 deg. C) were used here. The assays for checking inhibition of both the enzymes used published protocols with a few pertinent improvements. For alpha-glucosidase inhibition assay a paper by Toda et al. (Toda M., Kawabata J. and Kasai T. 2001 Inhibitory effects of ellagi-and gallotannins on rat intestinal a-glucosidase complexes. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 65: 542-547) was referred while for alpha-amylase inhibiton, a paper by Xiao et al. (Xiao Z, Storms R and Tsang A 2006 A quantitative starch-iodine method for measuring alpha-amylase and glucoamylase activities. Anal Biochem, 351: 146-148) was referred. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention for checking inhibition of alpha-glucosidase, rat intestinal acetone powder (Sigma Chem. Co. USA) was used as source of alpha-glucosidase enzyme (lU/ml). This was added to 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mM PNP and 10-20% (w/v) of various plant extracts in any of the solvents of extraction. The reaction was stopped with 2 M Tris buffer. Acarbose (25 mg in 250 pi water) was the positive control. The reaction was monitored by measuring absorbance at 405 nm. % inhibitory ratios for alphaglucosidase were calculated for all the variables and controls. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, after finding % inhibitory ratios as discussed above, it was found that plant extracts belonging to families Menispermaceae, Asteraceae, Nyctaginaceae, Myrtaceae showed better inhibition of alpha-glucosidase enzyme than the therapeutic drug acarbose. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the effective plant may belong to Tinospora spp. Or Psidium guajava. In yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention for checking inhibition of alpha-amylase, porcine alpha-amylase (SRL, India) was used. The total assay mixture composed of 40 pi 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9 containing 6 mM sodium chloride), 0.02 units of enzyme solution and various plant extracts at 10-20% (w/v) were incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Then soluble starch (1%, w/v) was added to each reaction well and incubated at 37°C for min. 1 M HC1 (20 pi) was added to stop the enzymatic reaction, followed by the addition of 100 pi of iodine reagent (5 mM 12 and 5 mM KI). Acarbose (25 mg in 250 pi water) was the positive control. The colour change was noted and the absorbance was read at 620 nm on a microplate reader. % inhibitory ratios for alpha-amylase were calculated for all the variables and controls. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, after finding % inhibitory ratios as discussed above, it was found that plant extracts belonging to families Menispermaceae, Asteraceae, Nyctaginaceae, Myrtaceae showed better inhibition of alpha-amylase enzyme than the therapeutic drug acarbose. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the effective plant may belong to Tinospora spp. Or Psidium gnajava. In still another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the enzyme inhibitory assays or both the enzymes were carried out by using plant extracts adjusted over a pH range of 3-8 and still % inhibitory ratios were better than those obtained with Acarbose. This signifies that nutraceuticals developed from these extracts can be consumed without any need for processing like encapsulation etc. Although exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alternations could be made thereto without departing from spirit and scope of the inventions as defined by the appended claims.
