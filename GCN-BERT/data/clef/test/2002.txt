Synthesis Example 6: Synthesis of Compound (1-1210-1)
1-Bromo-3-iodobenzene (3.57 g, 12.6 mmol, 1.0 eq.), P3Bpin (4.55 g, 1.0 eq.), sodium carbonate (4.01 g, 3.0 eq.), and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(0) (0.44 g, 0.03 eq.) were weighed and put into a 300 mL three-necked round bottom flask. Degassing under reduced pressure and nitrogen purge were sufficiently performed. Thereafter, toluene (40 mL), ethanol (10 mL), and water (10 mL) were added thereto in a nitrogen atmosphere, and the mixture was refluxed and stirred at 74° C. After three hours, heating was stopped, and the temperature of the reaction liquid was returned to room temperature. Extraction was performed with toluene three times, the organic solvent layers were then unified, anhydrous sodium sulfate was added thereto, and the mixture was allowed to stand for a while. Sodium sulfate was filtered off, and the solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting oil was caused to pass through a silica gel short column chromatography using toluene as an eluent, and a fraction containing a desired product was collected and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting oil was caused to pass through a silica gel column chromatography using heptane-toluene (9:1 (volume ratio)) as an eluent, and a fraction containing a desired product was collected and concentrated under reduced pressure. A desired product “P4Br” was obtained as a transparent oil (yield: 3.97 g, yield: 80.8%).
