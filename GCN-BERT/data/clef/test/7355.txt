FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to exendin-4 peptide analogues and their medical use, for example in the treatment of disorders of the metabolic syndrome, including diabetes and obesity, as well as reduction of excess food intake. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Exendin-4 is a 39 amino acid peptide which is produced by the salivary glands of the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) (Eng, J. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265: 20259-62,1990; Ng, J. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 267:7402-05, 1992). Like GLP-1, exendin-4 is an activator of the GLP-1 receptor. Unlike GLP-1, exendin-4 has a prolonged glucose-lowering action in vivo (Eng J., Diabetes, 45(Suppl 2):152A (abstract 554), 1996). The amino acid sequence of exendin-4 is shown as SEQ ID NO: 1: HGEGTFTSDLSKQMEEEAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH2 The amino acid sequence of GLP-1 is shown as SEQ ID NO: 2: HAEGTFTSDVSSYLEGQAAKEFIAWLVKGR Its actions include stimulation of insulin synthesis and secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, and inhibition of food intake. GLP-1 has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetics. There is also evidence that GLP-1 and exendin-4 may reduce food intake and promote weight loss (Buse J. B. et al., Lancet, 374:39-47, 2009). This effect would be beneficial not only for diabetics but also for patients suffering from obesity. Such patients with obesity have a higher risk of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal diseases. Glucagon is a 29-amino acid peptide which is released into the bloodstream when circulating glucose is low. Glucagon has the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 3: HSQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRRAQDFVQWLMNT During hypoglycemia, when blood glucose levels drop below normal, glucagon signals the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose, causing blood glucose levels to rise towards a normal level. Hypoglycemia is a common side effect of insulin therapy in patients with hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose levels) due to diabetes. Thus, glucagon's most recognized role in glucose regulation is to counteract the action of insulin and maintain blood glucose levels. Other peptides which bind and activate both the glucagon and the GLP-1 receptor (Hjort et al. Journal of Biological Chemistry, 269, 30121-30124, 1994) and suppress body weight gain and reduce food intake are described in WO 2011/075393, WO 2011/006497, WO 2011/152181, and WO 2011/152182, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. The use of exendin-4 agonists has been proposed for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, reduce of gastric motility, delay of gastric emptying and the prevention of hyperglycemia (U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,286, U.S. Pat. No. 6,858,576, WO98/05351). The use of exendin-4 agonists for reducing food intake is described in WO98/30231, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. Exendin-4 analogues have been described in WO99/43708, WO9/035540, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions The amino acid sequences of the present invention contain the conventional one letter and three letter codes for naturally occurring amino acids, as well as generally accepted three letter codes for other amino acids, such as Aib (α-aminoisobutyric acid), Orn (ornithin), Dab (2,4-diamino butyric acid), Dap (2,3-diamino propionic acid), Nle (norleucine), Abt (γ-aminobutyric acid) or Ahx (ε-aminohexanoic acid). The term “native exendin-4” refers to native exendin-4 having the sequence HGEGTFTSDLSKQMEEEAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: (1)). The invention provides peptidic compounds as defined above. The peptidic compounds of the present invention comprise a linear backbone of amino carboxylic acids linked by peptide, i.e. carboxamide bonds. Preferably, the amino carboxylic acids are α-amino carboxylic acids and more preferably L-α-amino carboxylic acids, unless indicated otherwise. The peptidic compounds preferably comprise a backbone sequence of 39-41 amino carboxylic acids. The peptidic compounds may be functionalized (covalently linked) with chemical moieties at their N-terminus, C-terminus and/or at least one side-chain. The N-terminus of the peptidic compound may be unmodified, i.e. an NH2 group or a mono- or bisfunctionalized NH2 group. At the C-terminus, the peptidic compounds may be unmodified, i.e. have a OH group or be modified, e.g. with an NH2 group or a monofunctionalized or bisfunctionalized NH2 group. The peptidic compounds of the present invention may have unmodified side-chains or carry at least one modification at one of the side chains. For the avoidance of doubt, in the definitions provided herein, it is generally intended that the sequence of the peptidic moiety (II) differs from native exendin-4 at least at one of those positions which are stated to allow variation. Amino acids within the peptide moiety (II) can be considered to be numbered consecutively from 0 to 40 in the conventional N-terminal to C-terminal direction. Reference to a “position” within peptidic moiety (II) should be constructed accordingly, as should reference to positions within native exendin-4 and other molecules. Substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring amino acids at positions 39 and/or 40 with an amino acid having a reactive side chain, e.g. an NH2 or SH group which enables conjugation to a functional group. For example, the residues at positions 39 and/or 40 may be Lys, Orn, Dab, Dap or Cys. The amino acid side chains may be conjugated with functional, e.g. lipophilic acyl groups. Thus, one or more selected amino acids of the peptides in the present invention may carry a covalent attachment at their side chains. In some cases those attachments may be lipophilic. These lipophilic side chain attachments have the potential to reduce in vivo clearance of the peptides thus increasing their in vivo half-lives. The lipophilic attachment may consist of a lipophilic moiety which can be a branched or unbranched, aliphatic or unsaturated acyclic moiety and/or a cyclic moiety selected from one or several aliphatic or unsaturated homocycles or heterocycles, aromatic condensed or non-condensed homocycles or heterocycles, ether linkages, unsaturated bonds and substituents, e.g. hydroxy and/or carboxy groups. The lipophilic moiety may be attached to the peptide either directly (alkylation, reductive amination) or by an amide bond or a sulfonamide bond in case of amino acids carrying an amino group at their side chain, an ester bond in case of amino acids carrying a hydroxy group at their side chain or thioether or thioester linkages in case of amino acids carrying a thiol group at their side chain or it may be attached to a modified side-chain of an amino acid thus allowing the introduction of a lipophilic moiety by click-chemistry or Michael-addition. Nonlimiting examples of lipophilic moieties that can be attached to amino acid side chains include fatty acids, e.g. C12-30 fatty acids such as palmitic acid, myristic acid, stearic acid and oleic acid, and/or cyclic groups as described above or derivatives thereof. There might be one or several linkers between the amino acid of the peptide and the lipophilic attachment. Nonlimiting examples of those linkers are β-alanine, γ-glutamic acid, γ-aminobutyric acid and/or ε-aminohexanoic acid or dipeptides, such as β-Ala-β-Ala and/or γ-Glu-γ-Glu. Thus, one nonlimiting example of a side chain attachment is palmitic acid which is covalently linked to the amino group of glutamic acid forming an amide bond. The γ-carboxy group of this substituted glutamic acid can form an amide bond with the side chain amino group of a lysine within the peptide. In a further aspect, the present invention provides a composition comprising a compound of the invention as described herein, or a salt or solvate thereof, in admixture with a carrier. The invention also provides the use of a compound of the present invention for use as a medicament, particularly for the treatment of a condition as described below. The invention also provides a composition wherein the composition is a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, and the carrier is a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Peptide Synthesis The skilled person is aware of a variety of different methods to prepare peptides that are described in this invention. These methods include but are not limited to synthetic approaches and recombinant gene expression. Thus, one way of preparing these peptides is the synthesis in solution or on a solid support and subsequent isolation and purification. A different way of preparing the peptides is gene expression in a host cell in which a DNA sequence encoding the peptide has been introduced. Alternatively, the gene expression can be achieved without utilizing a cell system. The methods described above may also be combined in any way. A preferred way to prepare the peptides of the present invention is solid phase synthesis on a suitable resin. Solid phase peptide synthesis is a well established methodology (see for example: Stewart and Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill., 1984; E. Atherton and R. C. Sheppard, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. A Practical Approach, Oxford-IRL Press, New York, 1989). Solid phase synthesis is initiated by attaching an N-terminally protected amino acid with its carboxy terminus to an inert solid support. This solid support can be any polymer that allows coupling of the initial amino acid such as e.g. a trityl resin, a chlorotrityl resin, a Wang resin or a Rink resin in which the linkage of the carboxy group (or carboxamide for Rink resin) to the resin is sensitive to acid (when Fmoc strategy is used). The polymer support must be stable under the conditions used to deprotect the α-amino group during the peptide synthesis. After the first amino acid has been coupled to the solid support, the α-amino protecting group of this amino acid is removed. The remaining protected amino acids are then coupled one after the other in the order represented by the peptide sequence using appropriate amide coupling reagents, for example BOP (benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)-phosphonium), HBTU (2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-uronium), HATU (O-(7-azabenztriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)-phosphonium) or DIC (N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide)/HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazol), wherein BOP, HBTU and HATU are used with tertiary amine bases. Alternatively, the liberated N-terminus can be functionalized with groups other than amino acids, for example carboxylic acids. Usually, reactive side-chain groups of the amino acids are protected with suitable blocking groups. These protecting groups are removed after the desired peptides have been assembled. They are commonly removed while the desired product is being cleaved from the resin under the same conditions. Protecting groups and the procedures to introduce protecting groups can be found in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3d ed., Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M., Wiley & Sons (New York: 1999). In some cases it might be desirable to have side-chain protecting groups that can selectively be removed while other side-chain protecting groups remain intact. In this case the liberated functionality can be selectively functionalized. For example, a lysine may be protected with an ivDde protecting group (S. R. Chhabra et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 39, (1998), 1603) which is labile to a very nucleophilic base, for example 4% hydrazine in DMF (dimethyl formamide). Thus, if the N-terminal amino group and all side-chain functionalities are protected with acid labile protecting groups, the ivDde ([1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-ylidene)-3-methylbutyl) group can be selectively removed using 4% hydrazine in DMF and can then be further modified, e.g. by acylation. The lysine can alternatively be coupled to a protected amino acid and the amino group of this amino acid can then be deprotected resulting in another free amino group which can be acylated or attached to further amino acids. Finally the peptide is cleaved from the resin. This can be achieved by using King's cocktail (D. S. King, C. G. Fields, G. B. Fields, Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 36, 1990, 255-266). The raw material can then be purified by chromatography if necessary. Potency As used herein, the term “potency” or “in vitro potency” is a measure for the ability of a compound to activate the receptors for GLP-1 or glucagon in a cell-based assay. Numerically, it is expressed as the “EC50 value”, which is the effective concentration of a compound that induces a half maximal increase of response (e.g. formation of intracellular cAMP) in a dose-response experiment. Therapeutic Uses The compounds of the invention are agonists for the receptors for GLP-1 and/or for glucagon (e.g. “dual agonists”), preferably for GLP-1 and glucagon and may provide an attractive option for targeting the metabolic syndrome by allowing simultaneous treatment of obesity and diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical disorders that, when occurring together, increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, as well as atherosclerotic vascular disease, e.g. heart disease and stroke. Defining medical parameters for the metabolic syndrome include diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, raised fasting glucose, insulin resistance, urinary albumin secretion, central obesity, hypertension, elevated triglycerides, elevated LDL cholesterol and reduced HDL cholesterol. Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health and life expectancy and due to its increasing prevalence in adults and children it has become one of the leading preventable causes of death in modern world. It increases the likelihood of various other diseases, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnoe, certain types of cancer, as well as osteoarthritis, and it is most commonly caused by a combination of excess food intake, reduced energy expenditure, as well as genetic susceptibility. Diabetes mellitus, often simply called diabetes, is a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has a high blood sugar, either because the body does not produce enough insulin, or because cells do not respond to the insulin that is produced. The most common types of diabetes are: (1) type 1 diabetes, where the body fails to produce insulin; (2) type 2 diabetes, where the body fails to use insulin properly, combined with an increase in insulin deficiency over time, and (3) gestational diabetes, where women develop diabetes due to their pregnancy. All forms of diabetes increase the risk of long-term complications, which typically develop after many years. Most of these long-term complications are based on damage to blood vessels and can be divided into the two categories “macrovascular” disease, arising from atherosclerosis of larger blood vessels and “microvascular” disease, arising from damage of small blood vessels. Examples for macrovascular disease conditions are ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Examples for microvascular diseases are diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, as well as diabetic neuropathy. The receptors for GLP-1 and glucagon are both members of the family B of G-protein coupled receptors. They are highly related to each other and share not only a significant level of sequence identity, but have also similar mechanisms of ligand recognition and intracellular signaling pathways. Similarly, the peptides GLP-1 and glucagon are highly homologous to each other, with similar length and regions of high sequence identity. Both are produced from a common precursor, preproglucagon, which is differentially processed in a tissue-specific manner to yield e.g. GLP-1 in intestinal endocrine cells and glucagon in alpha cells of pancreatic islets. The incretin hormone GLP-1 is secreted by intestinal endocrine cells in response to food and enhances meal-stimulated insulin secretion. Evidence suggests that GLP-1 secretion is reduced in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes, whereas responsiveness to GLP-1 is still preserved in these patients. Thus, targeting of the GLP-1 receptor with suitable agonists offers an attractive approach for treatment of metabolic disorders, including diabetes. The receptor for GLP-1 is distributed widely, being found mainly in pancreatic islets, brain, heart, kidney and the gastrointestinal tract. In the pancreas, GLP-1 acts in a strictly glucose-dependent manner by increasing secretion of insulin from beta cells. This glucose-dependency shows that activation of GLP-1 receptors is unlikely to cause hypoglycemia. At the beta cell level, GLP-1 has been shown to promote glucose sensitivity, neogenesis, proliferation, transcription of proinsulin and hypertrophy, as well as antiapoptosis. Other relevant effects of GLP-1 beyond the pancreas include delayed gastric emptying, increased satiety, decreased food intake, reduction of body weight, as well as neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects. In patients with type 2 diabetes, such extrapancreatic effects could be particularly important considering the high rates of comorbidities like obesity and cardiovascular disease. Glucagon is a 29-amino acid peptide hormone that is produced by pancreatic alpha cells and released into the bloodstream when circulating glucose is low. An important physiological role of glucagon is to stimulate glucose output in the liver, which is a process providing the mayor counterregulatory mechanism for insulin in maintaining glucose homeostasis in vivo. Glucagon receptors are however also expressed in extrahepatic tissues such as kidney, heart, adipocytes, lymphoblasts, brain, retina, adrenal gland and gastrointestinal tract, suggesting a broader physiological role beyond glucose homeostasis. Accordingly, recent studies have reported that glucagon has therapeutically positive effects on energy management, including stimulation of energy expenditure and thermogenesis, accompanied by reduction of food intake and body weight loss. Altogether, stimulation of glucagon receptors might be useful in the treatment of obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Oxyntomodulin is a 37-amino acid peptide hormone consisting of glucagon with an eight amino acids encompassing C-terminal extension. Like GLP-1 and glucagon, it is preformed in preproglucagon and cleaved and secreted in a tissue-specific manner by endocrinal cells of the small bowel. Oxyntomodulin is known to stimulate both, the receptors for GLP-1 and glucagon and is therefore the prototype of a dual agonist. As GLP-1 is known for its anti-diabetic effects, GLP-1 and glucagon are both known for their food intake-suppressing effects and glucagon is also a mediator of additional energy expenditure, it is conceivable that a combination of the activities of the two hormones in one molecule can yield a powerful medication for treatment of the metabolic syndrome and in particular its components diabetes and obesity. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention may be used for treatment of glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, increased fasting glucose, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerois, arteriosclerosis, coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, stroke or any combination of these individual disease components. In addition, they may be used for control of appetite, feeding and calory intake, increase of energy expenditure, prevention of weight gain, promotion of weight loss, reduction of excess body weight and altogether treatment of obesity, including morbid obesity. Further disease states and health conditions which could be treated with the compounds of the invention are obesity-linked inflammation, obesity-linked gallbladder disease and obesity-induced sleep apnea. Although all these conditions could be associated directly or indirectly with obesity, the effects of the compounds of the invention may be mediated in whole or in part via an effect on body weight, or independent thereof. Further, diseases to be treated are neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease, or other degenerative diseases as described above. Pharmaceutical Compositions The term “pharmaceutical composition” indicates a mixture containing ingredients that are compatible when mixed and which may be administered. A pharmaceutical composition may include one or more medicinal drugs. Additionally, the pharmaceutical composition may include carriers, solvents, adjuvants, emollients, expanders, stabilizers and other components, whether these are considered active or inactive ingredients. Guidance for the skilled in preparing pharmaceutical compositions may be found, for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, (20th ed.) ed. A. R. Gennaro A. R., 2000, Lippencott Williams & Wilkins. The exendin-4 peptide analogues of the present invention, or salts thereof, are administered in conjunction with an acceptable pharmaceutical carrier, diluent, or excipient as part of a pharmaceutical composition. A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” is a carrier which is physiologically acceptable while retaining the therapeutic properties of the substance with which it is administered. Standard acceptable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulations are known to one skilled in the art and described, for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, (20th ed.) ed. A. R. Gennaro A. R., 2000, Lippencott Williams & Wilkins. One exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is physiological saline solution. Acceptable pharmaceutical carriers or diluents include those used in formulations suitable for oral, rectal, nasal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, and transdermal) administration. The compounds of the present invention will typically be administered parenterally. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” means salts of the compounds of the invention which are safe and effective for use in mammals. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may include, but are not limited to, acid addition salts and basic salts. Examples of acid addition salts include chloride, sulfate, hydrogen sulfate, (hydrogen) phosphate, acetate, citrate, tosylate or mesylate salts. Examples of basic salts include salts with inorganic cations, e.g. alkaline or alkaline earth metal salts such as sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium salts and salts with organic cations such as amine salts. Further examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, (20th ed.) ed. A. R. Gennaro A. R., 2000, Lippencott Williams & Wilkins or in Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts, Properties, Selection and Use, e.d. P. H. Stahl, C. G. Wermuth, 2002, jointly published by Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta, Zurich, Switzerland, and Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany. The term “solvate” means complexes of the compounds of the invention or salts thereof with solvent molecules, e.g. organic solvent molecules and/or water. The term “therapeutically effective amount” of a compound refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the compound to provide the desired effect. The amount of a compound of the formula I necessary to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, for example the specific compound chosen, the intended use, the mode of administration and the clinical condition of the patient. An appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are those suitable for parenteral (for example subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal or intravenous), oral, rectal, topical and peroral (for example sublingual) administration, although the most suitable mode of administration depends in each individual case on the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and on the nature of the compound of formula I used in each case. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of separate units, for example capsules, tablets and powders in vials or ampoules, each of which contains a defined amount of the compound; as powders or granules; as solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. It may be provided in single dose injectable form, for example in the form of a pen. The compositions may, as already mentioned, be prepared by any suitable pharmaceutical method which includes a step in which the active ingredient and the carrier (which may consist of one or more additional ingredients) are brought into contact. Combination Therapy The compounds of the present invention, dual agonists for the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors, can be widely combined with other pharmacologically active compounds, such as all drugs mentioned in the Rote Liste 2012, e.g. with all antidiabetics mentioned in the Rote Liste 2012, chapter 12, all weight-reducing agents or appetite suppressants mentioned in the Rote Liste 2012, chapter 1, all lipid-lowering agents mentioned in the Rote Liste 2012, chapter 58, all antihypertensives and nephroprotectives, mentioned in the Rote Liste 2012, or all diuretics mentioned in the Rote Liste 2012, chapter 36. The active ingredient combinations can be used especially for a synergistic improvement in action. They can be applied either by separate administration of the active ingredients to the patient or in the form of combination products in which a plurality of active ingredients are present in one pharmaceutical preparation.

Methods General Synthesis of Peptidic Compounds Materials: Different Rink-Amide resins (4-(2′,4′-Dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)-phenoxyacetamido-norleucylaminomethyl resin) were used for the synthesis of peptide amides with loadings in the range of 0.3-0.4 mmol/g. Suppliers were Merck Biosciences and Agilent Technologies. From the same suppliers 2-chloro-trityl-chloride polystyrene resins with loadings up to 1.4 mmol/g were purchased and used for the synthesis of peptide acids. Fmoc protected natural amino acids were purchased from Protein Technologies Inc., Senn Chemicals, Merck Biosciences, Novabiochem or Iris Biotech. The following standard amino acids were used throughout the syntheses: Fmoc-L-Ala-OH, Fmoc-L-Asn(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-L-Asp(OtBu)-OH, Fmoc-L-Cys(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-L-Gln(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-L-Glu(OtBu)-OH, Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-L-His(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-L-Ile-OH, Fmoc-L-Leu-OH, Fmoc-L-Lys(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-L-Met-OH, Fmoc-L-Phe-OH, Fmoc-L-Pro-OH, Fmoc-L-Ser(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-L-Thr(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-L-Trp(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-L-Tyr(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-L-Val-OH. In addition, the following special amino acids were purchased from the same suppliers as above: Fmoc-L-Lys(ivDde)-OH, Fmoc-Aib-OH, Fmoc-D-Ser(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-D-Ala-OH, Boc-L-His(Boc)-OH and Boc-L-His(Trt)-OH. The solid phase peptide syntheses were performed on a Prelude Peptide Synthesizer (Protein Technologies Inc) using standard Fmoc chemistry and HBTU/DIPEA activation. DMF was used as the solvent. Deprotection: 20% piperidine/DMF for 2×2.5 min. Washes: 7×DMF. Coupling 2:5:10 200 mM AA/500 mM HBTU/2M DIPEA in DMF 2× for 20 min. Washes: 5×DMF. In cases where a Lys-side-chain was modified, Fmoc-L-Lys(ivDde)-OH was used in the corresponding position. After completion of the synthesis, the ivDde group was removed according to a literature procedure (S. R. Chhabra et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 39, (1998), 1603). The following acylations were carried out by treating the resin with the N-hydroxy succinimide esters of the desired acid or using coupling reagents like HBTU/DIPEA or HOBt/DIC. All the peptides that had been synthesized were cleaved from the resin with King's cleavage cocktail consisting of 82.5% TFA, 5% phenol, 5% water, 5% thioanisole, 2.5% EDT. The crude peptides were then precipitated in diethyl or diisopropyl ether, centrifuged, and lyophilized. Peptides were analyzed by analytical HPLC and checked by ESI mass spectrometry. Crude peptides were purified by a conventional preparative HPLC purification procedure. Analytical HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system with a Waters XBridge BEH130 3.5 μm C18 column (2.1×150 mm) at 40° C. with a gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and monitored at 215 and 280 nm. The gradients were set up as 10% B to 90% B over 15 min and then 90% B for 1 min or as 15% B to 50% B over 12.5 min and then 50% B to 90% B over 3 min. Buffer A=0.1% formic acid in water and B=0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. General Preparative HPLC Purification Procedure: The crude peptides were purified either on an Äkta Purifier System or on a Jasco semiprep HPLC System. Preparative RP-C18-HPLC columns of different sizes and with different flow rates were used depending on the amount of crude peptide to be purified. Acetonitrile+0.1% TFA (B) and water+0.1% TFA (A) were employed as eluents. Product-containing fractions were collected and lyophilized to obtain the purified product. Solubility and Stability-Testing of Exendin-4 Analogues Prior to the testing of solubility and stability of a peptide batch, its content was determined. Therefore, two parameters were investigated, its purity (HPLC-UV) and the amount of salt load of the batch (ion chromatography). Since synthesized peptides contain primarily trifluoracetate anions, only anion chromatography was performed. The content was then calculated based on the assumption that peptide-related impurities are detected at the same UV-absorption rate as the target peptide, as well as that cations are not present in the sample. For solubility testing, the target concentration was 1.0 mg/mL pure compound. Therefore, solutions from solid samples were prepared in different buffer systems with a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL compound based on the previously determined content. HPLC-UV was performed after 2 h of gentle agitation from the supernatant, which was obtained by 20 min of centrifugation at 4000 rpm. The solubility was then determined by comparison with the UV peak areas obtained with a stock solution of the peptide at a concentration of 2 mg/mL in pure water or a variable amount of acetonitrile (optical control that all of the compound is solved). This analysis also served as t0 for the stability testing. For stability testing, an aliquot of the supernatant obtained for solubility was stored for 7 days at 25° C. After that time course, the sample was centrifuged for 20 min at 4000 rpm and the supernatant was analysed with HPLC-UV. For determination of the amount of the remaining peptide, the peak areas of the target compound at t0 and t7 were compared, resulting in “% remaining peptide”, following the equation [in-line-formulae]% remaining peptide=[(peak area peptide t7)×100]/peak area peptide t0.[/in-line-formulae] The amount of soluble degradation products was calculated from the comparison of the sum of the peak areas from all observed impurities reduced by the sum of peak areas observed at t0 (i.e. to determine the amount of newly formed peptide-related species). This value was given in percentual relation to the initial amount of peptide at t0, following the equation: [in-line-formulae]% soluble degradation products={[(peak area sum of impurities t7)−(peak area sum of impurities t0)]×100}/peak area peptide t0[/in-line-formulae] The potential difference from the sum of “% remaining peptide” and “% soluble degradation products” to 100% reflects the amount of peptide which did not remain soluble upon stress conditions following the equation [in-line-formulae]% precipitate=100−([% remaining peptide]+[% soluble degradation products])[/in-line-formulae] This precipitate includes non-soluble degradation products, polymers and/or fibrils, which have been removed from analysis by centrifugation. Anion Chromatography Instrument: Dionex ICS-2000, pre/column: Ion Pac AG-18 2×50 mm (Dionex)/AS18 2×250 mm (Dionex), eluent: aqueous sodium hydroxide, flow: 0.38 mL/min, gradient: 0-6 min: 22 mM KOH, 6-12 min: 22-28 mM KOH, 12-15 min: 28-50 mM KOH, 15-20 min: 22 mM, suppressor: ASRS 300 2 mm, detection: conductivity. HPLC-UV Instrument: Agilent 1100, column: X-Bridge C18 3.5 μm 2.1×150 mm (Waters), eluent: A: H20+500 ppm TFA/B: Methanol, flow: 0.55 ml/min, gradient: 0-5 min: 10-60% B; 5-15 min: 60-99% B; detection: 214 nm. In Vitro Cellular Assays for GLP-1 Receptor and Glucagon Receptor Efficacy Agonism of compounds for the two receptors was determined by functional assays measuring cAMP response of HEK-293 cell lines stably expressing human GLP-1 or glucagon receptor. cAMP content of cells was determined using a kit from Cisbio Corp. (cat. no. 62AM4PEC) based on HTRF (Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence). For preparation, cells were split into T175 culture flasks and grown overnight to near confluency in medium (DMEM/10% FBS). Medium was then removed and cells washed with PBS lacking calcium and magnesium, followed by proteinase treatment with accutase (Sigma-Aldrich cat. no. A6964). Detached cells were washed and resuspended in assay buffer (1×HBSS; 20 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 2 mM IBMX) and cellular density determined. They were then diluted to 400000 cells/ml and 25 μl-aliquots dispensed into the wells of 96-well plates. For measurement, 25 μl of test compound in assay buffer was added to the wells, followed by incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature. After addition of HTRF reagents diluted in lysis buffer (kit components), the plates were incubated for 1 hr, followed by measurement of the fluorescence ratio at 665/620 nm. In vitro potency of agonists was quantified by determining the concentrations that caused 50% activation of maximal response (EC50). Single Subcutaneous Treatment of Exendin-4 Analogue on Blood Glucose in Female Diet-Induced Obese C57BL/6NCrl Mice (9 Months on High-Fat Diet) Female C57BL/6NCrl mice were housed in groups (n=8) and had ad-libitum access to high-fat diet and water. Initial blood samples were taken just before administration (s.c.) of vehicle (phosphate buffer solution) or the exendin-4 analogue (e.g. SEQ ID NO: (7)) (100 μg/kg in phosphate buffer) in fed DIO mice. The volume of administration was 5 mL/kg. The animals had access to high-fat diet and water during the experiment, food consumption was determined at all time points for blood sampling. Blood glucose levels were measured at t=0.5 h, t=1 h, t=2 h, t=4 h, t=6 h, t=8 h, and t=24 h. Blood sampling was performed by tail incision without anaesthesia. Statistical analyses were performed with Everstat 6.0 by repeated measures two-way ANOVA and Dunnetts post-hoc analyses. Differences were considered statistically significant at the p<0.05 level. Gastric Emptying and Intestinal Passage in Mice Female NMRI-mice of a body weight between 20 and 30 g were used. Mice were adapted to housing conditions for at least one week. Mice were overnight fasted, while water remained available all the time. On the study day, mice were weighed, single-caged and allowed access to 500 mg of feed for 30 min, while water was removed. At the end of the 30 min feeding period, remaining feed was removed and weighed. 60 min later, a coloured, non-caloric bolus was instilled via gavage into the stomach. The test product or its vehicle in the control group was administered subcutaneously, to reach Cmax when coloured bolus was administered. After another 30 min, the animals were sacrificed and the stomach and the small intestine prepared. The filled stomach was weighed, emptied, carefully cleaned and dried and reweighed. The calculated stomach content indicated the degree of gastric emptying. The small intestine was straightened without force and measured in length. Then the distance from the gastric beginning of the gut to the tip of the farthest travelled intestinal content bolus was measured. The intestinal passage was given as relation in percent of the latter distance and the total length of the small intestine. Statistical analyses were performed with Everstat 6.0 by Student's T-Test. Differences were considered statistically significant at the p<0.05 level. Automated Assessment of Feed Intake in Mice Female NMRI-mice of a body weight between 20 and 30 g were used. Mice were adapted to housing conditions for at least one week and for at least one day single-caged in the assessment equipment, when basal data were recorded simultaneously. On the study day, test product was administered subcutaneously close to the lights-off phase (12 h lights off) and assessment of feed consumption was directly started afterwards. Assessment included continued monitoring (every 30 min) over 22 hours. Repetition of this procedure over several days was possible. Restriction of assessment to 22 hours was for practical reason to allow for reweighing of animals, refilling of feed and water and drug administration between procedures. Results could be assessed as cumulated data over 22 hours or differentiated to 30 min intervals. Statistical analyses were performed with Everstat 6.0 by two-way ANOVA on repeated measures and Dunnetts post-hoc analyses. Differences were considered statistically significant at the p<0.05 level.
