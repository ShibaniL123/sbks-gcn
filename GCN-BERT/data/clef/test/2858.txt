DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS For purposes of description herein, the terms “upper,” “lower,” “right,” “left,” “rear,” “front,” “vertical,” “horizontal,” and derivatives thereof shall relate to various embodiments of the invention as oriented in the figures described below. However, it is to be understood that the invention may assume various alternative orientations and step sequences, except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following specification are exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the appended claims. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the claims expressly state otherwise. Workers today often desire to communicate with individuals who may be located in another physical place. For example, individuals who wish to communicate may be located in different cities, different buildings on a corporate campus, different floors or offices within a building, or one worker may be working remotely from his home or travel destination. Additionally, many workers seek out “third-spaces” such as coffee shops, libraries, or outdoor venues as work spaces, and may desire to communicate with an individual who is not also present at the selected third-space. Video communication is often the preferred method of communication between individuals because it affords the ability to communicate similarly to in-person communications. For example, individuals communicating via video may verbally exchange information while still perceiving non-verbal information related to the other participant or participants and the environment. In today's office environments, specific conference rooms are often designated for video communication and include the equipment necessary for video communication, namely a camera and a display. These rooms may be so equipped at great cost. Other conference rooms and shared spaces may lack dedicated equipment for video communication, and rarely will individual work spaces include the necessary components. However, may workers carry one or more devices that allow for video communication, such as a tablet or phone. Using one of these devices may allow for video communication, but may present a number of challenges depending on the environment. For example, laying a device on a work surface, such as a desk, may make it difficult for a remote participant (visible on the screen of the device) to view fully the environment of the on-site participant. If there are multiple on-site participants communicating with the remote participant, the remote participant may not be able to see both on-site individuals simultaneously. Utilizing a desk-top stand for a device may cause the remote participant to view the on-site participant and environment from an angle that would be avoided during in-person communication. In some instances, an on-site participant may feel uncomfortable with the way he or she may be displayed to the remote participant due to this angle. Further, the positioning of the device on a table may cause the on-site individuals to adjust or limit the way they communicate with each other. This may result in awkward and less productive communications. Various embodiments address these challenges by elevating the device to a location that more closely mimics in-person communication. Often video communication applications will display the upper body or head of a remote participant. Therefore, the video communication will be improved by positioning the display relative to an on-site chair such that the image of the remote participant's head is approximately at or near the likely location of the participant's head should he or she physically occupy the chair. Various embodiments described below illustrate how a device might be positioned relative a chair or general office environment to better mimic in-person communication and improve the experience of all participants. Moreover, today's physical office environment requires maximizing the use of limited floor plan space, and various embodiments disclosed herein leverage the often unutilized and valuable space located between seated, on-site conference participants, such as the open area between chairs or other seating arrangements. The reference numeral 10 (FIG. 1) generally designates an office system that includes multiple seating units 12 embodying the present invention. In the illustrated example, the office system 10 includes a seating unit 12, supporting a single display arrangement 14, a seating unit 16 supporting a dual display arrangement 18, a seating unit 18c supporting a dual display arrangement 18c, a seating unit 20 supporting a triple display arrangement 22, and a seating unit supporting a headrest, single display arrangement 14e. Although various display arrangements are illustrated in the present example, it is noted that other variations of single and multiple displays may be included. As best illustrated in FIG. 2, the seating unit 12 includes a chair assembly 24 that includes a pedestal support assembly 26 that supports the chair assembly 24 above a floor surface 27, a control assembly 28 supported by the pedestal support assembly 26, a seat assembly 30 and a back assembly 32, wherein the seat assembly 30 and the back assembly 32 are supported by the control assembly 28. As illustrated, the display arrangement 14 includes a single display 35 pivotably supported from the back assembly 32 by a display support assembly 37. In the illustrated example, the display 35 comprises a video-conferencing handheld device such as a tablet releasably supported within a display support 40. Although the video-conferencing handheld device comprises a table in the illustrated example, other suitable video-conferencing handheld devices such as portable computers, phones and the like, may be utilized. While the display support 40 is configured to allow a user to easily attach or couple the display 35 to the display support 40, alternatively, the display 35 may be permanently affixed to or integrally formed with the associated display support 40. The display support assembly 37 allows the display 35 to be moved between a storage position and a plurality of in-use positions. Specifically, the display support assembly 37 is adapted to allow the display 35 to be pivoted about a pivot axis 42, such that the display 35 is pivotable between a storage position A, wherein the display 35 is positioned behind the back assembly 32, and a variety of in-use positions. In a first in-use position B, the display 35 is positioned directly above the back assembly 32 and does not extend significantly beyond the sides of the back assembly 32. In a second in-use position C, the display 35 is positioned vertically and at least partially to the side of the back assembly 32. In-use position C allows an on-site participant to view the display 35 while another on-site participant is seated within the chair assembly 24. Alternatively, the chair assembly 24 and the display support assembly 37 may be configured such that the display 35 is located within an internal cavity (not shown) of the chair assembly 24 when the display 35 is in the storage position A. As best illustrated in FIG. 2, the seating unit 12 is configured such that the display arrangement 14 positions the display 35 at or near a natural head-height of a seated participant when the display 35 is positioned within the first in-use position B or the second in-use position C. Specifically, the display 35 is located at a height h above an upper seating surface 44 of the seat assembly 30 when the display 35 is in the first in-use position B or the second in-use position C. The height h is substantially the same as the height h′ (FIG. 1) of the head of a seated user positioned within a chair assembly 46 that is similarly configured to the chair assembly 24. Preferably, the display 35 is positioned between about 26 inches and about 34 inches above the seating surface or seat support surface 44, more preferably between about 27 inches and about 33 inches above the seat support surface 44, and most preferably between about 29 inches and about 31 inches about the seat support surface 44. Positioning the display 35 at the height h and its relationship and substantial similarity to the height h′ of the head of a seated user provides a natural viewing height for on-site participants of remote participants through the display 35, thereby facilitating a more natural conference-like setting that mimics more closely in-person communication. In addition, when an on-site user is seated in chair assembly 24 and display 35 is positioned in in-use position C, the remote participant will have a view of the on-site discussion that mimics the seated user's view. This may improve the remote participant's satisfaction with the communication, because he or she may be naturally turned to face a speaker or display space within the room as the seated user moves chair assembly 24 to face the speaker or display area. FIG. 3 illustrates an embodiment of display support assembly 37. Display support assembly 37 includes display support 40 and arm 41. Display support 40 includes two channels 50 that are coupled together via backing 52. Channels 50 are dimensioned to cradle an edge of a display. In some embodiments, channels 50 may be covered with rubber or other tacky material to prevent or lessen movement of the display when positioned in channels 50. Backing 52 includes springs 54 and sliding portions 56. Sliding portions 56 move with respect to each other and allow the distance between channels 50 to increase and decrease to accommodate a variety of device sizes and to accommodate the rotation of a device between landscape and portrait orientations. Springs 54 allow channels 50 to be pulled apart to insert or extract a device and provide tension to secure the device between channels 50. Springs 54 may be selected by spring force to ensure that the spring force is substantially greater than a gravitational force associated with the heaviest display intended to be used with the display support assembly 37. In various embodiments, display support 40 may too include additional channels, orientated at a 90 degree angle from channels 50, such that each edge of a device is held within a channel. Additionally or alternatively, display support 50 may hold two or more corners of a device. Some embodiments may omit springs 50 and may instead create tension between channels 50 in a variety of known ways. Arm 41 is pivotably coupled to a chair, such as chair assembly 24. It may be formed integrally with one or more of the components of display support 40, for example with one channel 50. Arm 41 may also be affixed to display support 40 in a variety of known methods. Arm 38 and/or display support 40 may be permanently coupled to a chair or may be releasably coupled such that a participant can remove the display support, insert his device, and then re-couple it to a chair. In certain embodiments, display support 37 may include various additional or alternative components adapted to position the device at or near the height of a participant's head. For example, display support assembly may include a flexible neck and/or a mounting cup that relies in full or in part on suction to couple a display mount to a component of the chair, a sheath-style rigid member 610 (FIG. 4) that encloses one or more edges of the display, and a variety or other related or known components suitable to position the device appropriately. The reference numeral 14a (FIG. 5) generally designates a single display arrangement slidably supported from a chair assembly 24a. Since the display arrangement 14a and the chair assembly 24a are similar to the previously described display arrangement 14 and chair assembly 24, similar parts appearing in FIGS. 2-4 and FIGS. 5-6, respectively are represented by the same, corresponding reference numeral, except for the suffix “a” and the numerals of the latter. The display arrangement 14a includes a display support 40a slidably supported from back assembly 32a of the chair assembly 24a by a slider arrangement 100 that is adapted to allow the display 35 to be moved in a direction 102 and a direction 103 between a first in-use position D located directly above the back assembly 32a and not extending significantly beyond the sides of the back assembly 32a, and a second in-use position E located at least partially to the side of the back assembly 32a, thereby allowing use of viewing of the display 35 from a position located in front of the back assembly 32a while an on-site user is seated within the chair assembly 24a. In various embodiments, the display support 40a may additionally or alternatively slide to an in-use position located partially or fully to the other side of the back assembly 32a. As noted above with respect to display arrangement 14, the display unit 14a is configured to position the display 35 at a vertical height h above the seating support surface 44a, wherein the height h is substantially the same as the height h′. Positioning the display 35 at the height h and its relationship and substantial similarity to the height h′ of the head of the seated user provides a natural viewing height for on-site participants of remote participants through the display 35, thereby facilitating a more natural conference-like setting that mimics more closely in-person communication. In addition, when an on-site user is seated with chair assembly 24 and display 35 is positioned in in-use position E, the remote participant will have a view of the on-site discussion that mimics the seated user's view. This may improve the remote participant's satisfaction with the communication, because he or she may be naturally turned to face a speaker or display space within the room as the seated user moves chair assembly 24. As best illustrated in FIG. 4, the display support assembly may also include a power source to provide power to the display 35, such as an electrical line 612, and/or a battery module 614, which may be used separately or in tandem with one another.
