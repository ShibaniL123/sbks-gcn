FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to an anhydrous transdermal formulation that contains a terpene, and more specifically a formulation suitable for transdermal delivery of active therapeutic agents to mammals. The present invention also relates to methods of manufacturing such compositions, and the use such compositions for treating animals. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION [0003] Skin forms an excellent barrier against drug permeation, due to the rigid lamellar structure of the stratum corneum (SC) lipids. The SC limits the rate of drug transfer through the skin. The rate of transfer is generally too slow for massive systemic absorption, making transdermal application unsuitable for the delivery of large amounts of drug in short periods of time. Transdermal application is more commonly used for the sustained delivery of drugs over a prolonged period of time. [0004] Transdermal formulations typically include permeation enhancers, which improve the rate of transfer of the drug across the skin. Permeation enhancers may act by disrupting the highly ordered structure of stratum corneum lipid, interacting with intercellular protein, and/or improving partition of the drug into the stratum corneum. A problem with transdermal formulations is that these permeation enhancers can cause skin irritation and inflammation. [0005] Small molecules of moderate lipophilicity permeate through skin most easily. The partition co-efficient Ρ in water and a hydrophobic organic solvent, such as octanol or hexane, is a useful measure lipophilicity. Molecules having a low log Ρ (i.e. hydrophilic compounds) have low permeability because partitioning into the skin lipids is low. Permeability at high log Ρ is also low. This may be due to the accumulation of lipophilic drugs in the stratum corneum due to low water solubility. [0006] There is a need for new transdermal formulations that avoid one or more of the aforementioned disadvantages. It is an object of the present invention to go some way to meeting this need; and/or to at least provide the public with a useful choice. [0007] Citation or identification of any document in this application is not an admission that such document is available as prior art to the present invention.

Examples of possible lipophilic active ingredients that can be delivered by the platform composition of the present invention include anthelmintics, non-steroidal and steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, anti-emetics, hypothyroidism treatment agents, behavioural treatment agent, or analgesics. [0153] In one embodiment, at least one of the active ingredients has a log Ρ in hexane and water at physiological pH (pH 7.4) of at least about -1, at least about 0, at least about 1, at least about 2, at least about 3, at least about 4, at least about 5, at least about 6, or at least about 7. In one embodiment, at least one of the active ingredients has a log Ρ in octanol and water at physiological pH (pH 7.4) of at least about -1, at least about 0, at least about 1, at least about 2, at least about 3, at least about 4, at least about 5, at least about 6, or at least about 7. [0154] In one embodiment the platform composition of the present invention may deliver multiple lipophilic active ingredients. For example, 2, 3, 4 or 5 actives delivered transdermally in a single composition. Preferably the active ingredients account for 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85 or 90% of the composition, and useful ranges may be selected between any of these values (for example, from about 1 to about 90, about 1 to about 75, about 1 to about 60, about 5 to about 100, about 5 to about 80, about 5 to about 55, about 25 to about 90, about 25 to about 65, about 25 to about 50, about 30 to about 90, about 30 to about 80, about 30 to about 70, about 30 to about 55, about 50 to about 90, about 50 to about 75, about 65 to about 90, about 65 to about 75 or about 70 to about 90% of the composition). [0155] In one embodiment the platform composition of the present invention may deliver active ingredients with a molecular weight of less than about 1000, 900, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 200 gmol"1 and useful ranges may be selected between any of these values (for example, from about 100 to about 1000, about 100 to about 900, about 100 to about 800, about 100 to about 600, about 100 to about 500, about 200 to about 1000, about 200 to about 900, about 200 to about 800, about 200 to about 700, about 200 to about 500, about 200 to about 400, about 300 to about 1000, about 300 to about 900, about 300 to about 700, about 300 to about 500, about 500 to about 1000, about 500 to about 800, about 500 to about 700, about 500 to about 600, about 700 to about 1000, about 700 to about 900, about 800 to about 1000). [0156] In one embodiment, at least one of the active ingredients has a molecular weight of at least about 300, at least about 400, at least about 500, or at least about 600 gmol"1. [0157] As mentioned above, anthelmintic agents may be delivered transdermally by the platform composition of the present invention. A candidate anthelmintic agent includes imidazothiazoles. For example, the imidazothiazole may be selected from levamisole, pyrantel pamoate, butamisol or tetramisole. Macrocyclic lactones are also candidate agents for delivery transdermally. For example, the macrocyclic lactone may be selected from avermectin, ivermectin, abamectin, eprinomectin, moxidectin, selamectin, doramectim, milbemycin, abamectin or cydectin. [0158] If an imidazothiazole, such as levamisole, is incorporated into the platform composition for transdermal delivery, preferably the composition may contain 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 or 60% imidazothiazole, and useful ranges may be selected between any of these values (for example, from about 1 to about 60, about 1 to about 40, about 1 to about 30, about 5 to about 60, about 5 to about 45, about 5 to about 35, about 5 to about 25, about 10 to about 60, about 10 to about 45, about 10 to about 30, about 10 to about 20, about 15 to about 60, about 15 to about 40, about 15 to about 30, about 15 to about 35, about 15 to about 30, about 15 to about 25, about 20 to about 60, about 20 to about 40, about 20 to about 30, about 25 to about 60, about 25 to about 45, about 25 to about 35, about 30 to about 60, about 30 to about 40, about 40 to about 60% imidazothiazole). [0159] If a macrocyclic lactone, such as moxidectin, is incorporated into the platform composition for transdermal delivery, preferably the composition may contain 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20% macrocyclic lactone, and useful ranges may be selected between any of these values (for example, from about 0.1 to about 20, about 0.1 to about 15, about 0.1 to about 12, about 0.1 to about 10, about 0.1 to about 5, about 0.1 to about 4, about 0.5 to about 20, about 0.5 to about 14, about 0.5 to about 10, about 0.5 to about 5, about 1 to about 20, about 1 to about 16, about 1 to about 11, about 1 to about 6, about 3 to about 20, about 3 to about 13, about 3 to about 7, about 5 to about 20, about 5 to about 14, about 5 to about 10, about 8 to about 20, about 8 to about 12, about 14 to about 20, about 16 to about 20% macrocyclic lactone). [0160] It should be appreciated that the exemplification of anthelmintics such as levamisole and moxidectin is not intended to be limiting, and that other lipophilic active ingredients could also be delivered within the composition. [0161] Anthelmintics include benzimidazoles, imidazothiazoles, tetrahydropyrimidines, macrocyclic lactones, salicylanilides, substituted phenols, aromatic amides, isoquinolines, amino acetonitriles, spiroindoles, and the like. [0162] Anthelmintic benzimidazoles include mebendazole, flubendazole, fenbendazole, oxfendazole, oxibendazole, albendazole, albendazole sulfoxide, thiabendazole, thiophanate, febantel, netobimin, and triclabendazole. Further examples include mebendazole, and ricobendazole. [0163] Benzimidazole based anthelmintics interfere with the worm's energy metabolism on a cellular level. They bind to a specific building block called beta tubulin and prevent its incorporation into certain cellular structures called microtubules, which are essential for energy metabolism. Interfering with energy metabolism is a much more basic mode of activity than that which occurs with other classes of anthelmintics. For this reason, benzimidazoles are also able to kill worm eggs. Benzimidazoles have a wide margin of safety and broad spectrum activity. [0164] Imidazothiazoles and tetrahydropyrimidines and both nicotinic agonists. Anthelmintic imidathiazoles include levamisole, tetramisole, and butamisole. Tetrahydropyrimidine anthelmintics include, for example, morantel, oxantel, and pyrantel. [0165] The tetrahydropyrimidines mimic the activity of acetylcholine, a naturally occurring neurotransmitter that initiates muscular contraction. The worm is unable to feed and quickly starves. Tetrahydroyrimidines only affect adult populations of worms. They do not have activity against the larval stages and are ineffective against cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (liver flukes). [0166] Imidazothiaoles have a similar mode of action causing spastic paralysis of the worms. Levamisole has a broad spectrum of activity and is effective against many larval stages of parasites. [0167] Macrocyclic lactones include abamectins, for example abamectin, doramectin, eprinomectin, ivermectin, and selamectin, and milbemycins, for example milbemycin oxime and moxidectin. [0168] The macrocyclic lactones (avermectins and milbemycins) are products or chemical derivatives of soil microorganisms belonging to the genus Streptomyces. All of the macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics have the same mode of action. They interfere with GABA-mediated neurotransmission, causing paralysis and death of the parasite. Macrocyclic lactones are the most potent killer of worms and are more persistent in their effect. The duration of persistent activity varies according to the drug and formulation. [0169] Macrocyclic lactones also have the unique quality of also killing several types of external parasite such as lice, mites, and ticks. They have a wide margin of safety for livestock and are effective against all stages of worms, including inactive forms. [0170] Salicylanilides include brotianide, clioxanide, closantel, niclosamide, oxyclozanide, rafoxanide, substituted phenols include bithionol, disophenol, hexachlorophene, niclofolan, menichlopholan, nitroxynil, and aromatic amides include diamfenetide (diamphenethide). [0171] Insoquinoline anthelmintics include praziquantel and epsiprantel. Praziquantel and epsiprantel have high efficacy against cestode parasites at relatively low dose rates but no effect on nematodes. Praziquantel is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the GI tract. [0172] Amino-acetonitrile derivatives include monepantel, which acts by paralyzing worms by attacking a previously undiscovered receptor HCO-MPTL-1, present only in nematodes. [0173] Further examples of anthelmintics include piperazine and derivatives thereof such as piperazine and diethylcarbamazine (DEC, a derivative of piperazine), benzenesulfonamides such as clorsulon, amidines such as bunamidine, isothiocyantes such as nitroscanate, and organophosphates such as dichlorvos, and spiroindoles such as derquantel (2- deoxoparaherquamide). [0174] The active ingredient may be a non-steroidal or steroidal anti-inflammatory. Examples of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs include, but are not limited to, acemetacin, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), alminoprofen, benoxaprofen, bucloxic acid, carprofen, celecoxib, clidanac, deracoxib, diclofenac, diflunisal, dipyrone, etodolac, fenoprofen, fentiazac, firocoxib, flobufen, flufenamic acid, flufenisal, flunixin, fluprofen, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, indoprofen, isoxicam, ketoprofen, ketorolac, meclofenamic acid, mefenamic acid, meloxicam, miroprofen, nabumetone, naproxen, niflumic acid, oxaprozin, oxepinac, phenylbutazone, piroxicam, pirprofen, pramoprofen, sudoxicam, sulindac, suprofen, tepoxalin, tiaprofenic acid, tiopinac, tolfenamic acid, tolmetin, trioxaprofen, zidometacin, or zomepirac, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and mixtures thereof. [0175] Most commercially available veterinary NSAIDs belong to two broad classes: carboxylic acid and enolic acid derivatives. The main groups of enolic acids are the pyrazolones (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, and ramifenazone) and the oxicams (meloxicam, piroxicam, and tenoxicam). Carboxylic acid groups include the salicylates (aspirin), propionic acids (ibuprofen, naproxen, carprofen, ketoprofen, and vedaprofen), anthranilic acids (tolfenamic and meclofenamic acids), phenylacetic acids (acetaminophen), aminonicotinic acids (flunixin), and indolines (indomethacin). [0176] Anti-inflammatory steroids include steroids which have an anti-inflammatory activity either locally or systemically. These are well-known within the art. Non-limiting examples of steroids include the adrenocorticoid steroids, whether endogenous or synthetic. These include, without limitation, hydrocortisone, betamethasone, cortisone, dexamethasone, prednisolone, prednisone, methylprednisilone, triamcinolone, flumethasone, and their pharmaceutically acceptable derivitives. In one embodiment, the steroid is hydrocortisone or cortisone. These steroids may be used at levels known in the art. [0177] The composition may comprise a steroid hormone. Steroid hormones include growth promoters and production enhancers. In one embodiment, the steroid hormone is a natural steroid hormone, such as estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone, or a synthetic steroid hormone, such as trenbolone acetate, estradiol benzoate, estradiol 17β, and melengestrol acetate, and zeranol. [0178] Steroid hormones include natural and synthetic steroid hormones, steroid hormone precursors, steroid hormone metabolites, and derivatives thereof that are structurally derived from cholesterol. Steroid hormones can be synthesized from cholesterol via pathways that involve cytochrome Ρ450 (cP450) enzymes, which are heme-containing proteins.

[0181] The composition may comprise a metabolic regulator, such a hypothyroidism treatment. Metabolic diseases may be inherited or acquired and are clinically important because they affect energy production or damage critical tissues. Storage diseases and inborn defects in metabolism may be either genetic or acquired. The diseases are characterized by the accumulation or storage of specific lysosomal enzyme substrates or byproducts within cells due to the partial or complete deficiency of those enzymes. The development of the metabolic diseases is largely related to production or management factors. However, the pathogenesis of the diseases is primarily related to alterations in metabolism. In many cases the basis of disease is not a congenital or inherited metabolic defect, but rather an increased demand for a specific nutrient that has become deficient. In one embodiment the metabolic regulator is a growth promoter, probotic or prebiotic, antibiotic or anti-infective supplement, electrolyte, mineral, vitamin, or other nutritional additive. [0182] The composition may comprise a productivity regulator, for example polyethers such as monensin. In one embodiment, the productivity regulator is a productivity enhancer.

[0260] In one embodiment, the mixture is administered within about 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 hours after mixing. In another embodiment, the mixture is administered within about 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, or 5 minutes after mixing. [0261] The composition of the invention and the second composition are separated from each other in the kit. The composition may be separated using, for example, a container, divided bottle or divided foil package. 6. Method of Manufacture [0262] In one embodiment there is a method of manufacturing a transdermal composition which may comprise 1. mixing a first composition which may comprise an active ingredient that is substantially insoluble in water, and a terpene, with a fatty acid ester, or 2. mixing a first composition which may comprise a terpene, with a second composition which may comprise an active ingredient that is substantially insoluble in water and a fatty acid ester, or 3. a first composition which may comprise a first active ingredient that is substantially insoluble in water, and a terpene, with a second composition which may comprise a second active ingredient that is substantially insoluble in water, and a fatty acid ester, thereby providing the transdermal composition. [0263] In one embodiment the first composition may include a triglyceride or glycerol ester. Preferably the first composition may contain triacetin (glycerin triacetate). [0264] In one embodiment the second composition may include a tripropylene glycol alkyl ether. Preferably the tripropylene glycol alkyl ether may be selected from tripropylene glycol methyl ether, tripropylene glycol mono-n-propyl ether, tripropylene glycol mono-n-butyl ether, or tripropylene glycol monomethyl ether (TPGME) or a combination of any two or more thereof. [0265] In one embodiment the second composition may include a non-heterocyclic ester. In one embodiment the non-heterocyclic ester may be a fatty acid ester. In one embodiment the fatty acid ester may have a C8-C2o alkyl chain. In one embodiment the fatty acid ester may have a Ci0-Ci6 alkyl chain. Preferably the fatty acid ester may be selected from isopropyl myristate. [0266] One example is of an anthelmintic composition. In this example the active ingredient of the first composition may be a lipophilic active such as levamisole base. Preferably the first composition may comprise a combination of levamisole base, a triglyceride or glycerol ester such as triacetin and a terpene penetration enhancer. Preferably the terpene penetration enhancer may be selected from limonene, menthol αphellandrene, 3-phellandrene or a combination thereof. The first composition ingredients are mixed by stirring until a homogenous mixture if the ingredients is formed. The first composition may be combined with at least a fatty acid ester. In one embodiment the second composition may also include a further active ingredient. By way of example, the active ingredient of the second composition may be different to the active ingredient of the first composition. For example, the active ingredient of the second composition may be a macrocyclic lactone. [0267] In one embodiment the second composition may include a triglyceride or glycerol ester. Preferably the second composition may contain triacetin (glycerin triacetate). The triglyceride or glycerol ester may be present in the first composition, the second composition or the first and the second compositions. [0268] The second composition may therefore comprise a second active such as a macrocyclic lactone, a triglyceride or glycerol ester such as triacetin and a tripropylene glycol alkyl ether. [0269] In one embodiment the second composition may also include a lipophilic organic antioxidant compound. In one embodiment the lipophilic organic antioxidant compound is present at about 0.01, 0.02, 0.04 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75. 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1.0, 1.5 or 2% by weight of the composition, and useful ranges may be selected between any of these values (for example, from about 0.01 to about 2. 0.01 to about 1, about 0.01 to about 0.85, about 0.01 to about 0.35, about 0.010.2, about 0.01 to about 0.08, about 0.06 to about 2, about 0.06 to about 1.5, about 0.06 to about 0.85, about 0.06 to about 0.45, about 0.06 to about 0.25, about 0.08 to about 2, about 0.08 to about 1.5, about 0.08 to about 0.85, about 0.08 to about 0.45, about 0.08 to about 0.25, about 0.1 to about 2, about 0.1 to about 0.95, about 0.1 to about 0.5, about 0.1 to about 0.25, about 0.15 to about 2, about 0.15 to about 0.95, about 0.15 to about 0.5, about 0.15 to about 0.25, about 0.4 to about 2, about 0.4 to about 1, about 0.4 to about 0.9, about 0.4 to about 0.7, about 0.7 to about 2, about 0.7 to about 1, about 1 to about 2 or about 1.5 to about 2% by weight of the composition). [0270] Preferably the lipophilic organic antioxidant compound may be a phenol derivative such as butylated hydroxytoluene. [0271] In one embodiment the lipophilic organic antioxidant compound may be required to assist or enhance the stability of one or more of the active ingredients. For example, in an anthelmintic platform compositions the lipophilic organic antioxidant compound may enhance the stability of the levamisole base, the macrocyclic lactone or the levamisole base and the macrocyclic lactone. [0272] In one embodiment the lipophilic organic antioxidant compound may assist or enhance the stability of the terpene penetration enhancer. For example, the lipophilic organic antioxidant compound may assist or enhance the stability of the limonene penetration enhancer. [0273] In one embodiment the second composition may comprise an active ingredient, a triglyceride or glycerol ester, a tripropylene glycol alkyl ether, and a ηοηheterocyclic ester such as a fatty acid ester. [0274] In one embodiment the second composition may comprise an active ingredient, a triglyceride or glycerol ester, a tripropylene glycol alkyl ether, a non-heterocyclic ester such as a fatty acid ester, and a lipophilic organic antioxidant compound. [0275] The first and second compositions may be combined together. As mentioned above, in the instance where the second composition does not include an active ingredient, the second composition may only comprise 1 or more solvents. For example, the first composition may combine solely a fatty acid ester. When the second composition comprises an active ingredient then the second composition may also include additional solvents to the fatty acid ester, such as one or more of a triglyceride or glycerol ester or a tripropylene glycol alkyl ether. The second composition may also comprise the lipophilic organic antioxidant compound regardless of whether the second composition contains an active ingredient or not. It should be appreciated that where the second composition does not comprise an active ingredient, the presence of the lipophilic organic antioxidant compound may act to assist or enhance the stability of the active ingredient in the first composition. The lipophilic organic antioxidant compound may also act to stabilise the terpene penetration enhancer. [0276] In one embodiment, once combined the mixtures may be mixed until dissolved. [0277] Following dissolution, in one embodiment additional terpene penetration enhancer may be added to the dissolved composition q.s. [0278] Following the option addition of q.s. terpene penetration enhancer to the dissolved mixture, in one embodiment the mixture may then be incubated above room temperature. In one embodiment the incubation is carried out with stirring. [0279] The dissolved mixture may be heated at any suitable temperature. The temperature may depend on the active ingredient(s) present in the mixture. In one embodiment the dissolved mixture may be heated to 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48 or 50°C, and useful ranges may be selected between any of these values (for example, from about 20 to about 50, about 20 to about 44, about 20 to about 40, about 20 to about 30, about 20 to about 26, about 24 to about 50, about 24 to about 44, about 24 to about 40, about 24 to about 36, about 24 to about 30, about 30 to about 50, about 30 to about 46, about 30 to about 42, about 30 to about 40, about 34 to about 50, about 34 to about 48, about 34 to about 52, about 34 to about 48, about 34 to about 46, about 34 to about 44, about 34 to about 42, about 34 to about 40, about 36 to about 50, about 36 to about 46, about 36 to about 42, about 36 to about 30, about 38 to about 50, about 38 to about 44, about 38 to about 40, about, about 40 to about 50, about 40 to about 48, about 40 to about 46, about 40 to about 42 or about 44 to about 50°C). Higher temperatures may be suitable, depending on the active ingredient(s) present in the mixture. [0280] In one embodiment the dissolved mixture may be heated for 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330, 360, 390, 420, 450, 480, 540, 600, 660, or 720 minutes, and useful ranges may be selected between any of these values (for example, from about 10 to about 720, about 10 to about 660, about 10 to about 600, about 10 to about 540, about 10 to about 480, about 10 to about 360, about 10 to about 240, about 10 to about 120, about 10 to about 60, about 60 to about 720, about 60 to about 660, about 60 to about 600, about 60 to about 540, about 60 to about 480, about 60 to about 390, about 60 to about 330, about 60 to about 240, about 60 to about 180, about 60 to about 120, about 120 to about 720, about 120 to about 660, about 120 to about 600, about 120 to about 540, about 120 to about 480, about 120 to about 420, about 120 to about 300, about 120 to about 270, about 120 to about 240, about 120 to about 180, about 210 to about 720, about 210 to about 660, about 210 to about 600, about 210 to about 540, about 210 to about 480, about 210 to about 390, about 210 to about 360, about 210 to about 270, about 270 to about 720, about 270 to about 660, about 270 to about 600, about 270 to about 540, about 270 to about 480, about 270 to about 420, about 270 to about 360, about 270 to about 300, about 360 to about 720, about 360 to about 660, about 360 to about 600, about 360 to about 540, about 360 to about 480, about 360 to about 420, about 420 to about 720, about 420 to about 660, about 420 to about 600, about 420 to about 540, about 420 to about 480 or about 450 to about 720, about 450 to about 660, about 450 to about 600, about 450 to about 540, about 450 to about 480, about 540 to about 720, about 540 to about 660, about 540 to about 600, about 600 to about 720, about 600 to about 660, about 660 to about 720minutes). [0281] The heated composition may be then cooled and packaged for use. [0282] Once cooled, in one embodiment the composition may be assayed for the active ingredient activity. [0283] In one embodiment the composition may comprise optionally about 1 to about 60% w/w levamisole base, optionally about 0.1 to about 20% w/w macrocyclic lactone, optionally about 1 to about 40% w/w fatty acid ester, optionally about 1 to about 60% w/w terpene, and optionally about 1 to about 25% w/w non-aqueous solvent. [0284] In one embodiment the composition may have good physical and chemical stability, providing at least 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30 months shelf life, and useful ranges may be selected between any of these values (for example, from about 12 to about 30, about 12 to about 26, about 12 to about 20, about 12 to about 17, about 13 to about 30, about 13 to about 25, about 13 to about 17, about 13 to about 15, about 16 to about 30, about 15 to about 30, about 15 to about 27, about 15 to about 22, about 15 to about 19, about 14 to about 30, about 14 to about 28, about 14 to about 22, about 14 to about 18, about 14 to about 17, about 17 to about 30, about 17 to about 28, about 17 to about 23, about 17 to about 20, about 18 to about 30, about 18 to about 27, about 18 to about 24, about 18 to about 22, about 20 to about 30, about 20 to about 28, about 20 to about 26, about 25 to about 30, about 25 to about 28, about or about 27 to about 30 months shelf life). [0285] In one embodiment the platform composition may be a solution, suspension, emulsion, microemulsion, or micelle composition. [0286] In another embodiment, the composition may be a homogeneous or heterogeneous mixture, a solution, suspension (e.g. of submicron to micron particles), emulsion, microemulsion, micellar or encapsulated composition. 7. Use of the anhydrous transdermal platform composition [0287] The platform composition is capable of delivering a range of drug candidates, including anthelmintics, as single entities or in combination. The platform composition delivers the actives to the systemic circulation by passive diffusion. [0288] The composition is for treating an animal in need thereof. The suitability of the composition for treating a particular disease or condition, for example, depends on the active ingredients present in the composition. [0289] The term "treatment", and related terms, such as "treating" and "treat" as used herein, relates generally to treatment, of either a human or a non-human animal, in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved. The therapeutic effect may, for example, be the inhibition of progress of a disease or condition, including a reduction in the rate of progress, a halt in the rate of progress, amelioration, and cure. Treatment as a prophylactic measure is also included. Treatment also includes combination treatments and therapies, in which two or more treatments or therapies are used, for example, sequentially or simultaneously, in combination. [0290] The present invention therefore provides use of a composition of the present invention for treating an animal in need thereof. [0291] The present invention also provides a method of treating an animal in need thereof, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a composition of the present invention. [0292] The present invention also provides use of a composition of the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for treating an animal in need thereof. [0293] The animal to be treated may be human or non-human. Non-human animals include, for example, production animals, such as, cattle, sheep, swine, deer, and goats; companion animals, such as, dogs, cats, and horses; zoo animals, such as, zebras, elephants, giraffes, and large cats; research animals, such as, mice, rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs; fur-bearing animals, such as, mink; birds, such as, ostriches, emus, hens, geese, turkeys, and ducks. [0294] In one embodiment, the animal is a non-human animal. In one embodiment, the animal is a non-human mammal. In one embodiment, the animal is a production animal or companion animal. [0295] In one embodiment, the composition is for treating a helminth infection or infestation. The composition comprises at least one anthelmintic. [0296] Helminths include, but are not limited to, cestodes (flatworms), nematodes (roundworms), and trematodes (flukes), such as, Trichostrongyloidea, inlcuding Haemonchus contortus; Trichostrongylus spp.; Dictyocaulus spp.; Ascaridoidea, including Toxocara spp.; Strongylus spp.; Filarioidea, including Dirofilariaimmitis and Onchocerca spp: Trematoda, including Fasciolahepatica and Schistosoma spp.; Taenia spp.; and Moniezia spp.; Ostertagia spp.; Nematodirus spp.; Cooperia spp.; Bunostomum spp.; Oesophagostomum spp.; Chabertia spp, Trichuris spp.; Trichonema spp.; Capillaria spp.; Heterakis spp.; Toxocara spp.;, Oxyuris spp.; Ancylostoma spp.; Uncinaria spp.; Toxascaris spp.; and Parascaris spp. [0297] In one embodiment, the helminth is selected from Haemonchus spp.; Ostertagia spp.; Trichostrongylus spp.; Nematodirus spp.; and Cooperia spp. [0298] The transdermal composition is for topically administration. The composition may be administered, for example, in the form of a sterile cream, gel, pour-on or spot-on formulation, suspension, lotion, ointment, dusting powder, spray, drug- incorporated dressing, skin patch, dip, spray, emulsion, jetting fluid, or shampoo. [0299] In one embodiment, the composition is a pour-on or spot-on formulation. Such formulations may be prepared by the method described herein. Pour-on, spot-on or, spray formulations can be prepared to leave a residue of active agent on the surface of the animal. [0300] Kits of the invention are suitable for administering different dosage forms of more than one anti-parasitic agent by separating the agents using, for example, a container, divided bottle or divided foil package. [0301] A person skilled in the art will be able to readily determine the appropriate dosage of administration for treating an animal. The dosage will depend upon the active ingredient(s) present in the composition and may also depend on the frequency of administration, the sex, age, weight and general condition of the animal treated, the nature and severity of the condition treated, any concomitant diseases to be treated, and any other factors evident to those skilled in the art. [0302] In one embodiment the platform composition may comprise doses at low volume. In one embodiment the composition is administered at 0.005, 0.006, 0.007, 0.008, 0.009, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, or 1 mL/kg of live weight animal and useful ranges may be selected between any of these values (for example, from about 0.005 to about 1, from 0.005 to about 0.8, from 0.005 to about 0.6, from 0.005 to about 0.5, from 0.005 to about 0.3, from 0.005 to about 0.2, from 0.005 to about 0.1, from 0.005 to about 0.05, from 0.005 to about 0.01, from 0.008 to about 1, from 0.008 to about 0.8, from 0.008 to about 0.6, from 0.008 to about 0.5, from 0.008 to about 0.4, from 0.008 to about 0.1, from 0.008 to about 0.09, from 0.008 to about 0.05, from 0.008 to about 0.01, from 0.01 to about 1, from 0.01 to about 0.8, from 0.01 to about 0.6, from 0.01 to about 0.5, from 0.01 to about 0.3, from 0.01 to about 0.1, from 0.01 to about 0.09, from 0.01 to about 0.06, from 0.01 to about 0.05, from 0.01 to about 0.04, from 0.03 to about 1, from 0.03 to about 0.8, from 0.03 to about 0.6, from 0.03 to about 0.5, from 0.03 to about 0.4, from 0.03 to about 0.2, from 0.03 to about 0.1, from 0.03 to about 0.09, from 0.03 to about 0.08, from 0.03 to about 0.06, from 0.03 to about 0.05, from 0.05 to about 1, from 0.05 to about 0.8, from 0.05 to about 0.6, from 0.05 to about 0.5, from 0.05 to about 0.4, from 0.05 to about 0.3, from 0.05 to about 0.1, from 0.05 to about 0.09, from 0.05 to about 0.07, from 0.1 to about 1, from 0.1 to about 0.8, from 0.1 to about 0.6, from 0.1 to about 0.5, from 0.1 to about 0.4, from 0.1 to about 0.3, from 0.3 to about 1, from 0.3 to about 0.8, from 0.3 to about 0.6, from 0.3 to about 0.5, from 0.5 to about 1, from 0.5 to about 0.8, from 0.5 to about 0.6, from 0.6 to about 1, from 0.6 to about 0.8, from 0.8 to about 1 mL/kg of live weight animal). Regardless of this low volume, the platform composition delivers the active ingredients within their therapeutic dose range to the target animal. [0303] The volume of the dose may depend on the active ingredients present in the composition and also on the animal to be treated. For example, the composition may be administered at from about 0.025 ml_/ kg to about 0.1 mL/kg for production animals, such as cattle, or from about 0.01 mL/kg to about 0.1 mL/kg for companion animals, such as cats and dogs. [0304] The platform technology provides a number of advantages including ■ good wetting/spreading properties, ■ no, or very little, hair loss or skin damage, ■ no, or very little, apparent residue/oil on skin, and/or ■ no, or very little, apparent photosensitivity. [0305] Spreadability can be measured directly by applying a known volume and measuring wetted area. UV light can be used to visualize certain formulations. Residue on skin can be measured by swabbing/extraction. Hair loss and photosensitivity may be evaluated by field observation.

Abamectin stability [0315] The purpose of this study was to examine the stability of abamectin in glycerol formal (GF) alone and solvent systems containing complexing (e.g. PVP), acidifiers (e.g. malic acid) and chelating agents (e.g. EDTA) in combination with glycerol formal. Table 2. Stability data for Levamisol base and abamectin in solvent system containing glycerol formal (GF). glycerol formal (GF). No. Formulation % Abamectin recovery After 1 week at 50°C 1 Lev + Aba + GF 89.1 2 Lev + Aba + GF + Malic (0.5%) 94.5 3 Lev + Aba + GF + oxalic (0.5%) 94.0 4 Lev + Aba + GF + citric (2.0%) 93.3 5 Lev + Aba + GF + PVP (5.0%) 93.4 6 Lev + Aba + GF + EDTA (0.1%) 91.2 7 Lev + Aba + GF + methionine (2.0%) 83.9 [0316] As shown in Table 2, the percentage recovery of abamectin after one week at 50°C was highest in those formulations that contained malic, oxalic, and citric acid, and PVP. A formulation comprising levamisole, abamectin and glycerol formal did not perform as well as the formulations containing malic, oxalic, and citric acid, and PVP. [0317] Other solvent systems comprising tripropylene glycol methylether (TPGME), isopropylenglycol and tetraglycol to replace glycerol formal were evaluated. [0318] TPGME was found to be a good candidate. 3. Carrier stability [0319] These studies looked at the stability of compositions of the invention which may comprise the carriers dimethyl isosorbate (DMI), triacetin, agnique 810, and isopropyl mirystate (IPM) if necessary as a penetration enhancer. [0320] This study also looked at tripropylene glycol methylether (TPGME) or tetraglycol or isopropyleneglycol. [0321] This study also further analysed the effect of the following on stability. ■ The addition of acidifiers. e.g. Malic acid ■ The addition of complexing agents, e.g. PVP. ■ Use of non polar solvents, e.g. limonene.

[0323] As shown in Table 4 each of the formulations tested demonstrated good recovery of levamisole and abamectin after two months at 30°C, reduced but still good recovery of abamectin after two months at 40°C, and reduced abamectin recovery after two months at 50°C. 4. Stability with formulations comprising surfactants [0324] The purpose of this study was to examine the stability of the formula which may comprise surface active agents such as surfactants. [0325] The formulation of the platform composition is given in Table 5. Table 5.

Three temperatures (RT, 4.5°C and -20°C) were used to monitor for phase separation and/or drug crystal formation every one or two days from 6 days. Each surfactant was added to the test composition as a percentage of weight, therefore changing the concentrations of the original ingredients. However, most of the tests used less than 4% of each surfactant. Only in the 5% and 10% Brij 93 samples was the higher concentration of surfactant present likely to have an effect on the test composition. [0327] The formulations were studied at room temperature (24 ± 1°C) and fridge temperature (4.2-4.5°C). [0328] As shown in Table 6 each of the surfactants tested maintained the solubility of the test composition at room temperature. [0329] Brij 93 (polyoxyethylene (2) oleyl ether) was effective in maintaining the stability of the test composition at fridge temperature (~4°C). Table 6.

Permeability studies [0330] This example describes the use of the platform composition to deliver a range of different actives across the skin of a range of different animals (cow, horse, rabbit). [0331] The actives investigated in this example are ■ levamisole base (anthelmintic), ■ macrocyclic lactones (abamectin and moxidextin) (anthelmintics), ■ hydrocortisone (steroidal anti-inflammatory), ■ metoclopramide (antiemetic), ■ cetirizine (antihistamine), and ■ diphenhydramine (anti-histamine). [0332] The characteristics for each of the actives tested are shown below in Table 7. Table 7.

(~23 5.1 Methods 5.1.1 Skin Sample Preparation [0336] Full thickness rabbit or horse skin samples and half thickness bovine (~500 pm) skin samples were excised from different animals above the scapular and over the withers regions. The bovine samples were obtained from 2-5 year old steers, horse samples were obtained from the abattoir, and rabbit skin from euthanized animals after research studies. Immediately after excision, the skin was wrapped in aluminium foil, put into plastic bags, and stored at below 6°C for delivery to the research laboratory. Flair of the collected skin was cut using a hair clipper with surgical blade 50 (0.4 mm) and the underlying excessive fat layer was also carefully removed from the hypodermis using a scalpel (size 20) and discarded. The skin samples were then frozen at < -20°C for further preparation and stored for no more than 16 weeks prior to use. [0337] Before each experiment, partially thawed skin was sheared to remove the entire hair layer and skin samples of 500 ± 30 pm thickness were cut using a dermatome. The dermatome was fitted with duplex blades from Stericut, Reference Sll-103. Skin samples with epidermis/dermis were then finally cut into approximately 2 to 2.5 cm2 and placed on a Franz cell between the donor (containing 1 ml_ formulation) and receptor compartments (12 ml_). [0338] The ex vivo permeation of each drug was determined by using Franz diffusion cell; VTC 200 by Logan Instruments Corporation (New Jersey, USA), which takes its name from Dr. Thomas Franz who first popularised this method. This method has been used in many skin permeation studies, including topical and transdermal drug delivery formulations, as well as opthalmics, cosmetics, skin care products and pesticides. This system is approved by the FDA. See "Guidance for Industry Nonsterile Semisolid Dosage Forms Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Release Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation", U.S. Department of Health and Fluman Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), May 1997, SUPAC-SS, CMC 7. [0339] Briefly described, the Franz Cell chamber is an in vitro skin permeation assay that consists of two primary chambers separated by a membrane. Bovine skin was used as the membrane. The sub-cutaneous layer was first removed by scalpel having a thickness of 0.1 to 1 mm. The skin sample was placed in propylene glycol 40% ν/ν (q.s. Milli Q water) and phosphate buffer to pH 7.4 at a temperature of 39°C ± 1°C and equilibrated for 12 hours. The bovine epidermis hair was sheared to 0.4 cm and the remaining hair sheared to just above the stratum corneum layer. The epidermis and some dermis was removed (approximately 500 pm) and sections were cut to 2 cm by 2 cm for each Franz cell unit. The test composition was loaded into a loading volume of 1.0 mL and applied to the membrane via the top chamber. The bottom chamber contains fluid from which samples are taken at regular intervals for analysis. This testing determines the amount of active that has permeated the membrane at each time point. The chamber is maintained at a constant temperature of 37° C. [0340] The moxidectin, abamectin and levamisole tests on bovine skin was tested using the Franz cell system FDC-6 (Logan Instruments, USA). The reminder of the APIs were tested using a new Franz cell system DFIC-6T (Logan Instruments, USA). Further more, the new test included the use of dry heated cell as opposed to a water bath, syringe sample collection and the use of Teflon (TFE) coated cells to prevent bubble formation. [0341] The samples were taken up to 58 hrs post-administration and drug concentrations were measure by UFIPLC. [0342] The in vitro method (Franz Cell) differs to in vivo because it uses dead skin with no functioning vascular system. Therefore, the drug needs to permeate through the entire piece of skin before being collected in the receptor fluid for analysis. To compare the actual flux rates of the drugs, the lag time before drug enters the receptor fluid was ignored, and the rate of increasing concentration was calculated from when the active was detected in the fluid. This removes some of the variability due to skin thickness. [0343] The bovine skin was mounted on the receptor compartment with the SC side facing upwards into the donor compartment (12 ml_ and 1 ml_, respectively). Receptor medium was composed of propylene glycol (PG) 39%, ethanol (1%), and buffer phosphate 0.1Μ (19% NaH2P04 0.1Μ and 81% Na2HP04 0.1Μ, pH 7.4). Ethanol was added to the receptor medium to maintain sink condition for the lipophilic drugs which only partially mimics in vivo where blood flow provides constant elimination by transport of the drug away from the site of delivery. The medium was proved to have no drug degradation at 40°C for 12 days. Buffer was used due to the presence of basic the drug: LEV (pKa = 8). The available diffusion area of cell was 1.77 cm2. The receptor compartment was maintained at 39 ± 1°C and stirred by a magnetic bar at 600 rpm, which also helps improve the problem of a static diffusion cell system (i.e. increased drug dissolution). At periodic intervals, samples (400 pL) were withdrawn from the sampling port and immediately replaced by an equal volume of fresh receptor medium which was pre-warmed at 39 ± 1°. The samples were then analyzed by an HPLC method with UV detection. All formulations were tested at least in triplicate. 5.1.2 Moxidectin Skin Deposition Study [0344] The amount of moxidectin accumulating in the bovine skin was determined using whole skin thickness (approx. 4 cm) and split skin thickness (approx. 500 μΜ) after 72 hours. The skin tissue was physically broken down using a Gentle MACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Germany) with 5 mL of methanol added into each sample. The dissociator setting was RNA-02.01 with M-type tubes for 90 seconds. Centrifuged samples had the supernatant collected and diluted 2 times with ACN before being analysed by the HPLC method. 5.2 Results 5.2.1 Permeability Studies [0345] The formulation of Table 9 was tested for its flux across bovine skin with η = 5. The results are shown in Figure 2 that shows the permeability of moxidectin over 72 hours. The moxidectin had a flux rate of 475 ± 185.2 ng/cm2/hr from linear section of profile (R2 = 89.4%). Error bars are standard deviation. [0346] The formulation of Table 9 was tested for its flux across bovine skin with η = 5. The results are shown in Figure 3 that shows the permeability of levamisole over 72 hours. Levamisole has a flux rate of 949.6 ± 80.8 pg/cm2/hr from linear section of profile (R2 = 99.4%). Error bars are standard deviation. [0347] A commercial formulation was also tested. The Eclipse ΡΟ formulation contains abamectin and levamisole. The results are shown in Figure 4 that shows the permeability of abamectin in Eclipse over 72 hours with η =3. The abamectin had a flux rate of 33.9 ± 26.3 pg/cm2/hr. Error bars are standard deviation. The results are shown in Figure 5 that shows the permeability of levamisole in Eclipse over 72 hours with η =3. The levamisole had a flux rate of 204.4 ± 17.1 pg/cm2/hr. Error bars are standard deviation. [0348] The formulation containing diphenhydramine exhibited a flux rate of 41.47 ± 10.18 pg/cm2/hr in rabbit skin (see Figure 6), 25.3 ± 1.9 pg/cm2/hr in horse skin (see Figure 7), and 95.1 ± 33.1 pg/cm2/hr in bovine skin (see Figure 8) as shown below in Table 13.

The amount of active permeated over 24 hours was plotted over time (hours). Regression analysis was carried out on linear regions of each plot. The lag time, Lagt, was then calculated using the steady state flux (Jss) by measuring the linear portion of the cumulative penetration curve to the time axis where drug release was equal to zero, such that the following formula can be deducted: where, h is the skin membrane thickness (pm) and D is the diffusion coefficient provided that the membrane thickness is available. On the permeation profile the Flux (pg-cm"2-h_1) was represented by the y-axis and time (t) was plotted on the x-axis. The apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) was calculated using the following equation. pw=(dx,/<*)T.c„ where Papp is determined with the final units as cm-s'1, Xr is the amount of active in the receptor chamber, A is the surface area of skin exposed (cm2), and C0 is the initial active concentration at specific time point (pg-mL1). [0354] The formulations of Table 11 and Table 12 were also tested against Eclipse. [0355] Both abamectin and levamisole were able to permeate across in vitro bovine split skin over 72 hours. Figures 18 and 19 show the cumulative drug mass (pg/cm2) over time (hrs) for abamectin and levamisole, respectively. Table 18.

Permeability parameters for levamisole.* * Data from split skin samples [0356] Table 18 presents the permeability parameters for ABM from each formulation. At steady-state, ABM was observed to have a Papp of 3.3 ± 0.6 cm/s χ 10"8 from the Formulation of Table 11, while the Formulation of Table 12 had a Papp of 3.0 ± 0.7 cm/s χ 10"8. The mean lag time for the Formulation of Table 11 was significantly shorter to that of the Formulation of Table 12, 6.9 hours compared to 21.2 hours, respectively (p-value < 0.01). A shorter lag time is ideal, indicating that steady state is reached more quickly. In this case, although the lag time for the Formulation of Table 12was much longer than the Formulation of Table 11 it was able to almost reach a similar mean permeability extent after 72 hours, 166.9 and 186.3 μg/cm2, respectively. Furthermore, this delayed ABM permeability but similar extent of permeability across the bovine skin, explains the improved flux observed from the Formulation of Table 12. Interestingly, the Formulation of Table 12 had a higher flux (permeability rate) of 4.6 ± 1.8 μg/cm2/hr, while Formulation of Table 11 had a flux of 2.7 ± 0.4 μg/cm2/hr, although these results were not significantly different (p-value > 0.05). For clarity, flux is the slope of the amount permeated over time, hence the delayed ABM permeation from Formulation of Table 12 compared to Formulation of Table 11, yet similar permeation extent, meant the slope (flux) from Formulation of Table 12 was steeper compared to that of Bola (original). Finally, the Formulation of Table 11 and Eclipse ΡΟ had generally similar ABM permeability parameters, see Table 2. The one way ANOVA results are given in Table 3. [0357] For Levamisole, the Formulation of Table 11 had a lag time of 2.6 ± 1.2 hours and the Formulation of Table 12 had a similar lag time of 2.5 ± 0.8 hours (p-value > 0.05). A summary of the permeability parameters describing the in vitro permeability of LEV are given in Table 4. The one way ANOVA results are given in Table 5. 5.2.2 Moxidectin Deposition Study [0358] The proportion of the drug at the three compartments, donor, skin and receptor at 72 hours is shown below. Table 20. Table showing the proportion of the drug in the three compartments: donor, skin and receptor at 72 hours. Receptor Skin Donor Whole skin 3% 32% 65% 500 pm skin 31% 18% 51% 6. Upper skin permeability [0359] The purpose of this study is to test the permeability of the active ingredients through the upper skin layer only. The upper skin provides the "real" barrier to the transport of actives across the skin. In vivo, once an active penetrates the skin it is then transported away by a network of blood vessels. [0360] When testing whole skin in vitro, the whole skin provides a variable result and probably gives an artificially low estimate of permeability for lipophilic compounds that tend to be trapped in the subcutaneous fat when no blood vessels are present to transport the actives away. More hydrophilic compounds progress faster into the receptor fluid. 6.1 Method [0361] A skin sample is prepared for the Franz cell technique, which has been described above. The skin sample is prepared absent the subcutaneous fat. [0362] The test composition is used to determine the flux rate of moxidectin and levamisole. 6.2 Result [0363] A result showing a higher flux rate that for whole skin moxidectin and/or levamisole demonstrates that moxidectin and/or levamisole pass the upper skin barrier easily and that the sub cutaneous layers limit their passage in vitro. 7. Effect of limonene on skin disruption [0364] The purpose of these studies was to examine the effects of limonene on skin disruption. 7.1 Method [0365] The Franz chamber, as described above, was used to determine permeability. [0366] The test composition was carried out with three different concentrations of limonene: 6, 12 and 24% by weight. 7.1.1 Histology [0367] Flistology was carried out to look at the effect of the formulation on the degree of stratum corneum disruption. The skin tissue was sectioned and stained and the examined under a light microscope or electron microscope to visualize or differentially identify microscopic structures through the use of histological stains. 7.1.2 FTIR [0368] Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to measure how well the samples absorbed light at each wavelength. [0369] Lipid disruption was monitored by IR spectrum. A change in water content observed in IR spectrum was used as an indication of lipid disruption. 8. Results 8.1.1 Histology [0370] Microscopic analysis of the membrane exposed to 6% limonene showed the top layer begins to lift from the epidermis. Membrane exposed to 12% limonene exhibited a broken layer of epidermis. Membrane exposed to 24% limonene exhibited a highly disrupted and mashed layer of epidermis. [0371] The results show that the top layer of the epidermis is damaged. However, this damage is reversible as the top layer is refreshed almost constantly. The results also showed that there was no damage to the dermis or the epidermis. [0372] Histological analysis also showed that there was increased oil in the epidermis, which suggests that the limonene may result in pushing cells apart to create channels through which the active ingredients can more easily pass. 8.1.2 FTIR [0373] A typical IR spectrum for untreated bovine skin is shown as Figure 18 where A = Amide II (weak), Β = Amide I, C = CH2 symmetrical stretching, D = CH2 asymmetrical stretching, and Ε = water content. [0374] Shown below in Table 21 is a comparison of IR spectrum data for untreated and treated skin. Table 21.

There does not appear to be any apparent cellular damage of the SC. This (transient) disruption of the lipid layer will potentially "open" a passage for the diffusion of drug. This is confirmed by the FTIR studies below. EXAMPLE 3-CLINICAL STUDIES [0376] Two clinical efficacy studies were carried out. The study design for each study is summarised below. ■ Study 1-Winter coat ο Control ο Test composition with no rain ο Test composition with rain 2 hours after application ■ Study 2-Summer coat ο Control ο Test composition ο Comparator product (Eclipse-combination dual pour-on containing abamectin and levamisole) ο Single-active comparator product [0377] The purpose of study 1 was to evaluate the efficacy of the test composition against gastrointestinal parasites in cattle with a winter coat, and to determine the effect of rain, after application of the composition to the skin of the cattle, on the composition's efficacy. [0378] The purpose of study 2 was to evaluate the efficacy of the test composition against gastrointestinal parasites in cattle with a summer coat, and to compare against the comparator product Eclipse. [0379] The test composition is shown below in Table 22. Table 22. Composition for efficacy study Ingredient Classification Quantity (O/o) Abamectin Macrocyclic lactone 1 Levamisole (Base) Imidazothiazole derivative 20 Triacetin glycerin triacetate / glycerol triester 42 Isopropyl mirystate (IPM) FA ester 10 tripropylene glycol monomethyl ether (TPGME) Glycol ether 6 Limonene cyclic terpene QS (21) TOTAL 100 [0380] The test composition was observed to be a clear straw-coloured solution with a citrus like smell, with good syringability. It was found to be free flowing, to readily wet the hair coat and rapidly passed down the hair coat to the skin, without leaving any oily residue. 9. Efficacy study - Winter coat 9.1 Treatment groups [0381] The study comprised six infected beef and dairy calves per treatment group. [0382] Treatment Groups consisted of Group 1 that remained as untreated controls, Group 2 were animals treated with the test composition applied to a dry coat then showered with 10 ml_ simulated rain 2 hours after treatment, then protected from any rain for at least 24 hours and Group 3 were animals treated with the test composition applied to a dry coat and then protected from any rain for at least 24 hours. Table 23. Treatment groups Group Number Treatment Animal Number 1 Untreated Control 6 2 Test composition 10 mL Simulated Rain at 2 hours 6 3 Test composition No rain for 24 hours 6 TOTAL 18 [0383] Each animal was treated at a rate of 1 ml/20 kg body weight, which equates to 500 μg macrocyclic lactone and 10 mg levamisole per kg. 9.2 Study design [0384] This study was carried out as a randomised, stratified controlled study on cattle, less than 12 months of age, with winter coats and a mean weight of 118.5 kg. [0385] The test composition was administered as a single topical treatment to two groups of dry cattle at standard label dose rates, based on individual body weight. Two hours after treatment, one group was sprayed with 10 ml_ of simulated rain by overhead nozzles, and then kept dry until 24 hours after treatment. The other pour-on group was kept dry for 24 hours. [0386] Efficacy of treatment was measured by faecal egg counts at 6 and 10 days post treatment and at slaughter on Day 13. Efficacy was also measured 13 days after treatment by abomasal, small intestinal and large intestinal worm counts, assessed by genus and stage, relative to the parasite burden in the control group animals, with speciation of appropriate worm genera. Lungworm burden in the control group was investigated by counting lungworm in three animals to determine if a suitable lungworm burden was present, and if further lungworm counts were justified. [0387] Clinical behavioural observations and measurements and pour-on site inspections post treatment were made. Two separate studies were performed. The first study was carried out on beef and dairy calves with a winter coat. Testing was carried out without and with rain 2 hours after application The second study was carried out on beef and dairy calves with a summer coat. Testing was carried out comparing the test composition to a comparator product and to single-active comparator product. [0388] The animals were slaughtered at day 13/14 after treatment and faecal egg count (FEC) and worm count measured. [0389] The study protocol is shown below in Table 24. Table 24.

The worm count data was tabulated and statistically analysed including tests for normal distribution (Bartlett's test of equal variance) and tests for significance between the means of treated and control groups compared using One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Efficacy of treatment on worm count and egg counts (for each sampling) was calculated according to the following equation using both arithmetic and geometric means: „ , . GroupMeariuntreated) - GroupMeanitreated) , ^ % Reduction (Efficacy%) = - - -χ100 Gro upMean(un treated) [0392] Secondary data including the observations was tabulated including totals and means to determine if there were any treatment effects. 9.4 Results 9.4.1 Faecal egg counts [0393] The faecal egg counts showed that the untreated control animals (η = 6) were uniformly positive (150-500 epg) over the trial period. At allocation (Day -2) they had a mean of 317 epg AM (296 epg GM) with the mean egg counts remaining at 300 epg AM (284-293epg) GM at Days 6, 10 and 13. The mean of Groups 2 (η = 6) and 3 (η = 6), had similar means at the time of allocation at 325 epg (AM) or 304epg (GM) for Group 2 and 308 epg (AM) or 291 (GM) for Group 3. After treatment both test composition treated groups had uniformly negative egg counts at 6, 10 and 13 days after treatment. There was no significant difference in group mean faecal egg counts at the time of allocation, but the differences between control and treated groups at the post-treatment counts was highly significant (>0.0001).

Quantitative larval culture analysis confirmed that no larvae could be detected in either test composition treated group. This result indicates it is a highly effective anthelmintic and also that the levamisole component of the test composition was effective as no surviving Cooperia larvae (resistant) were detected.

The test composition treatments gave complete (100%) reductions, with no worms found. These reductions were highly significant for Ostertagia (adult and L4 stages), but there were insufficient Τ. axei or Haemonchus in the controls to allow assessment and statistical analysis. The Ostertagia present were confirmed as Ostertagia ostertagi (94.7%)and Ostertagia lyrata (5.3%), with a total of 57 male worms available for speciation from the controls. Table 28.

Small intestine [0397] Small intestinal worm counts confirmed that the control animals were uniformly infected with moderate Cooperia burdens, mainly adults (10,142 AM, 5912 GM) and smaller numbers of L4 (258ΑΜ, 107GM) and Ε4 stages (50 AM, 16 GM) with only occasional Trichostrongylus spp and Nematodirus spp present. The test composition treatment gave complete (100%) reductions, with no worms found (Group 2 and Group 3). These reductions were highly significant for Cooperia (adult, L4, and Ε4 stages) but there were insufficient Trichostrongylus or Nematodirus in the controls to allow assessment and statistical analysis. The Cooperia present were confirmed as Cooperia oncophora (99.6%) with very small numbers of Cooperia punctata (0.4%), with a total of 252 male worms available for identification from the controls. Only two male Nematodirus were found in one animal (Tag #13) both identified as Λ/. helvetianus, and no male Trichostrongylus spp were found so species identification could not be performed.

The test composition treatment gave complete (100%) reductions, with no worms found (Group 2, and Group 3). These reductions were highly significant for both Trichuris and Oesophagostomum.

The exudate often had small white lines/fissures, which appeared to be early lifting of the outer layer of the epidermis and formation of scurf/scale (exfoliation). This reaction was not uniform. It was focused particularly in the first 10 cm near the withers and an area some 20-30 cm from the withers (mid-back) suggesting some types of skin are more reactive. The back midline of the calves was approximately 90-100cm long and other quite large areas were unaffected despite the pour-on being applied evenly along the entire length. At Day 12 after application the exudate had largely resolved (score 0.17) with lifting epidermal flakes/scurf (score 1 to 1.33) growing out in the hair with the underlying skin intact. These epidermal flakes varied from very small 1-2 mm up to flakes 2x3 cm in the hair coat. There was no hair loss, and the changes were considered mild and within the range observed for some other similar registered pour-ons and could be easily missed without close observation. The underlying skin also appeared intact, with no reddening and there was rapid measured resolution even at 12 days without any treatment and no undue animal distress or changes in behaviour. It was considered that these skin changes may be in part related to one of the active components rather than simply the solvent system, as almost identical lesions with the same distribution pattern were observed with another registered levamisole base pour on formulation - see Eclipse pour on skin findings in Efficacy Study AR-CSR-0004. [0404] Excluding the four hides sampled for histology the remaining hides were recovered at slaughter on Day 13, identified to treatment group by punching 1, 2 or 3 holes in the hide in the area of the tail head and delivered to Warren Bell, Acting Plant Manager, Graeme Lowe Corporation, Fellmonger/Tannery, Onehunga, Auckland. The skins were processed to the wet blue stage of tanning and graded by the plant manager for quality as 1st, 2nd or 3rd grade hides, with the results shown in Table 33. Light discolouration (darkening) corresponding to the pour-on site as occurred with the test composition treatments is often seen on "wet-blue" hides and was not graded as a fault. Table 33. Hide grade assessment by treatment group 1st grade 2nd grade 3rd qrade Total hides Controls 5 0 0 5 Group 2 4 1 0 5 Group 3 2 plus 1 graded as 1-2 1 0 4 [0405] Key: 1st grade hide does not have any serious defect, 2nd grade hide has moderate sized or moderately severe defect(s), 3rd grade hide has a severe defect(s). The defects observed comprised a roughened surface. [0406] As shown above eleven of the 14 hides were graded as 1st, with all Controls assessed as 1st Grade (5 of 5) while 4 of the 5 test composition treated hides were 1st Grade in Group 2 and 2 of 4 in Group 3. Those graded as 2nd Grade included lof 5 in Group 2 and 1 of 4 in Group 3. One hide in Group 3 was graded mid way as a ist-2nd grade. [0407] Causes for the 2nd grades included: Two small areas of roughened hide, 5x5 cm, one at withers and one in the lumbar region on one of the five Group 2 hides and two similar areas of roughened hide in the withers and lumbar region on one of the four Group 3 hides. A second Group 3 hide was classified as borderline grade ist-2nd due to a single 4x5 cm area of slightly roughened hide. Two or three of 9 hides recording a 2nd grade were regarded by the plant manager as a typical grading result for a line of hides. [0408] Hides from the calves were recovered and processed 13 days post treatment, 22 days earlier than would occur with a withhold period of 35 days. The observation that a majority of hides in the test composition treated groups were 1st Grade, the lesions were Grade 2 and that the skin observations indicated a rapid resolution of the epidermal flakes/scurf following application is expected to further reduce any affects of treatment on the quality of tanned hides when harvested at the normal withhold time. No lesions, epidermal flakes or scurf were reported when the test composition was administered in older 300 kg animals in the Residue Study ARAB2679 at Armidale Australia, and detailed observations from the Safety Study AR-CSR-0003 noted the following "There was mild superficial non painful scurf formation along midline areas of the back, particularly the withers in all treated animals 6 days after treatment, but without reddening, oedema or ulceration or hair loss. There was a reduction and early resolution in this scurf reaction by 14 days after treatment and the scurf had virtually completely resolved in all animals by Day 35 without treatment". 9.5 Conclusions [0409] The Test composition Pour-on (abamectin and levamisole base) when applied along the midline of the back in beef calves with winter coats, at a dose rate of 1 ml per 20 kg, gave complete, and highly significant (p<0.0001) reductions in egg count and worm count relative to untreated controls. Efficacy was not affected by 10 ml of simulated rain applied 2 hours after application. [0410] The reductions of roundworm numbers were significant (p<0.05) or highly significant (p<0.01) for the parasites present in the various organs including: Ostertagia spp (adult and L4 stage) in the abomasum, Cooperia spp (adult, L4 and Ε4 stage) in the small intestine and Oesophagostomum radiatum and Trichuris spp in the large intestine. [0411] Speciation of the worm types showed predominantly Ostertagia ostertagi with small numbers of Ostertagia lyrata, and mainly Cooperia oncophora with small numbers of Cooperia puntata. [0412] The reductions in worm numbers were in excess of >98% AM or GM, and are consistent with a highly effective anthelmintic as defined in both ACVM and VICH guidelines. [0413] The Test composition was well tolerated. Some initial reaction and awareness to the application of the pour on including licking or kicking at the back was seen in the first 10 minutes but this passed rapidly, and by 30 minutes all calves were grazing normally. Mild scurf and some exfoliation of the superficial epidermis was seen at Day 3-4 post treatment, more particularly at the withers or sometimes mid back, but this was resolving and the underlying skin was intact at the time of slaughter (Day 13 post treatment). The skin reaction was considered mild and within the range of skin reactions observe with other similar pour ons. All behavioural observations and clinical measurements showed no difference to untreated controls. [0414] Two of nine Test composition treated hides were found with moderate defects following slaughter at Day 13 and processing to the wet blue stage and one hide had a lesser fault, an acceptable and typical industry result which is expected to improve further when hides are harvested at or after the proposed withhold time of 35 days. 10. Efficacy study - Summer coat 10.1 Treatment groups [0415] The study comprised six infected beef and dairy calves per treatment group (group 2a contained two animals). [0416] Treatment Groups consisted of Group 1 that remained as untreated controls, Group 2 were animals treated with the test composition applied to a dry coat then showered with 10 ml_ simulated rain 2 hours after treatment, then protected from any rain for at least 24 hours and Group 3 were animals treated with the test composition applied to a dry coat and then protected from any rain for at least 24 hours.

[0422] Natural roundworm infection was acquired from calves grazing infective pasture. 10.3 Statistics [0423] The primary data in the study were the individual worm counts. The worm count data was tabulated and statistically analysed including tests for normal distribution and tests for significance between the means of treated and control groups compared using One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Efficacy of treatment on worm count and egg counts (for each sampling day) was calculated according to the following equation using both arithmetic and geometric means: GroupMeanCuntreated) - GroupMean(treated) % Reduction (Efficacy %) = - - - - - -χ100 GroupMeaniuntreated) [0424] Secondary data including the observations was tabulated including totals and means to determine if there were any treatment effects. 10.4 Results 10.4.1Faecal egg counts [0425] The faecal egg counts showed that the untreated control animals (η = 6) were uniformly positive with eggs counts varying from 150-500 epg over the trial period. The pour-on treatment groups including Groups 2, 2b, 3 and 4 had similar mean egg counts at Day -5 (the counts that were used for allocation to treatment). There was no significant difference in group mean faecal egg counts at the time of allocation, but the differences between control and all treated groups at all times post treatment was highly significant (>0.01). All animals treated with the abamectin + levamisole pour-ons, (Test composition and Eclipse in Groups 2, 2b and 4) gave complete control of egg output. In contrast Group 3 animals treated with the single active abamectin pour-on (Bomectin Gold pour-on) gave incomplete reductions in egg count, with a reduction relative to controls of 97.3% at 6 days post treatment and 93.1% at Day 12 post treatment. This finding was consistent with the larval culture and worm count findings for this group discussed later (Section 15.3), and the selection criteria of farms with a history of ML resistant Cooperia.

Pooled Quantitative larval culture analysis (40 g/group) conducted on faecal samples collected at the time of slaughter confirmed that a mixed worm population was present with high numbers of larvae detected (13,000 larvae/40 g). Low numbers of larvae (140 larvae/ 40 g) were also found in the cattle treated with Abamectin pour-on alone (Bomectin Gold). The larvae recovered from this group were all Cooperia spp (100%). This is consistent with an ML resistant Cooperia worm strain as also discussed under worm counts. Abamectin is more potent on gastrointestinal parasites than ivermectin so the apparent level of resistance in this study would be more pronounced with a product containing ivermectin. In contrast, no larvae could be detected in a pooled 40 g sample from either of the Abamectin + Levamisole pour-on groups, including the Test composition treatment (Groups 2&2b) and Eclipse treatment (Group 4). The sensitivity of this test was increased further by separately culturing 40 g of faeces from each of the two calves treated with the Test composition on the lower back only (Group 2b). Again no larvae were recovered from either animal in Group 2b (80 g total). This result is consistent with the Test composition having very high efficacy with effective removal of adult worm stages, and that the levamisole component of the Test composition (as with Eclipse pour-on) is effective in removing ML resistant adult Cooperia stages which was confirmed in worm count results discussed in Section 15.3.1.

The Test composition treatment gave complete (100%) reductions, with no worms found. These reductions were highly significant for Ostertagia (adult and L4 stages), Τ. axei adults and significant for Haemonchus contortus. This was also true for those treated with the Test composition on the lower back only (Group 2b), and also for those calves treated with Eclipse pour-on (Group 4). What was notable however was that while the reduction in abomasal worm numbers was still effective with Bomectin Gold pour-on, it did not completely remove Ostertagia with an adult stage and L4 stage found in two separate animals, while nothing was detected in any of those treated with an abamectin + levamisole pour-on. Typically ML's are highly effective against Ostertagia in cattle, and levamisole frequently less effective. [0428] The Ostertagia spp from the controls was speciated50worms and confirmed as Ostertagia ostertagi (98%) and Ostertagia lyrata2 male worms found in the Group 3 were both identified as Ostertagia Trichostongylus spp and Haemonchus spp in cattle are consideredin New Zealand which has been confirmed in other studies, so were not Table 39.

Small intestine [0430] Small intestinal worm counts confirmed that the control animals uniformly infected with moderate-high Cooperia burdens, mainlyAM, 21692GM) and moderate numbers of L4 (3408ΑΜ, 2596GM) and noThere were no Trichostrongylus detected in the small intestine but thealmost uniformly (5/6) infected with L4 stages of Nematodirus spp (200 AM, 83GM) and slightly less uniformly infected with small numbers of adult stages (75 AM, 11 GM). The Test composition treatment (Group 2 and Group 2b) gave complete (100%) reductions of these worms and worm stages, with no difference detected in those receiving the pour on only on the lower back (Group 2b). These reductions were highly significant for Cooperia (adult, L4 stages) and Nematodirus L4 and significant for Nematodirus adults. Interestingly a small number of Ε4 Cooperia larvae were detected in 4/8 Test composition treated animals (AM 112), but not seen in the controls, indicating very early re-infection post treatment and possibly suggesting less persistent activity than the positive control abamectin pour ons in this study. Eclipse pour-on treated animals in Group 4 gave similar reductions but no Ε4 larvae were seen. Bomectin Gold pour-on containing abamectin alone did not give full reductions against Cooperia stages, with only 89.4% control of adult stages (AM) and 98.8% reductions of L4 stages. While the Cooperia reduction for this treatment remained statistically highly significant, the product achieved only moderate efficacy (80-89%), which was lower than its "effective" label claim. Experience with abamectin versus ivermectin via topical treatment in cattle, suggest that if a less potent ML such as ivermectin had been used the efficacy (inefficacy) would have been even lower. Fifty male Cooperia present in the controls were speciated and confirmed to consist of Cooperia oncophora (76%) and Cooperia punctata (24%), while 50 male worms in the Bomectin Gold pour on group (Group 3) were entirely Cooperia oncophora (100%). Only four male Nematodirus were found in two control animals and all four worms were identified as Λ/. helvetianus. Table 40.

Large intestine [0432] Large intestinal worm counts confirmed that the control animals were uniformly infected with small numbers of Oesophastomum adults (113.3 AM, 105 GM) and variably infected with lower numbers of Trichuris adults (6.7ΑΜ, 4.9 GM). The Test composition pour on treatment (Groups 2&2b) and both Bomectin Gold pour on (Group 3) and Eclipse pour on (Group 4) gave complete (100%) reductions in both worm genera. These reductions were highly significant for the Oesophagostomum spp, but the reduction in Trichuris were not significant because of low worm numbers and variable infection in the controls. Differentiation for Trichuris is not performed routinely and is referred to as Trichuris species. Oesophagostomum in cattle is assumed to be O. radiatum as it is assumed to be monspecific in New Zealand. Table 41.

Lung worm [0434] Lung worm larval culture from the pooled faecal sample (25-30 g) of the control animals at Day 6 using a modified Baemann technique were negative for lungworm larvae and so no lungs were collected at slaughter for lungworm examination. 10.5 Conclusions [0435] The test composition pour-on (abamectin + levamisole base) when applied along the midline of the back in dairy calves with summer coats, at a dose rate of 1 ml per 20 kg, gave complete and highly significant (p<0.001) reductions in egg count and worm count relative to untreated controls. The efficacy and safety of the pour-on did not appear affected by the product being applied only to the midline of the lower back (from mid-back to the base of tail) compared to application along the entire midline of the back, from the withers to the base of the tail [0436] The reductions of roundworm numbers were significant (p<0.05) or highly significant (p<0.001) for the parasites present in the various organs including: Ostertagia spp (adult and L4 stage), Trichostrongylus axei (adult) and Haemonchus contortus (adult) in the abomasum, Cooperia spp (adult, L4 stages) and Nematodirus spp (adult and L4) in the small intestine and Oesophagostomum radiatum in the large intestine. [0437] Speciation of the worm types showed predominantly Ostertagia ostertagi with small numbers of Ostertagia lyrata, and Cooperia oncophora and Cooperia punctata. The adult stages of Nematodirus were identified as Λ/. helvetianus. [0438] The reductions in worm numbers were in excess of >98% AM or GM, and are consistent with a highly effective anthelmintic as defined in both ACVM and VICH guidelines. [0439] The reference product Eclipse Pour-on, which also delivers abamectin and levamisole base at the same dose rate as the investigational product gave similar complete reductions in worm count. [0440] In contrast Bomectin Gold pour-on containing only abamectin was only moderately effective on adult Cooperia oncophora (89.4% AM) and did not achieve "effective" control as per its label claim. It appeared to give effective control of Cooperia punctata. It did not achieve complete control of L4 stages (98.8% AM) which the combinations achieved. It is considered that if a less potent ML such as ivermectin had been used then the efficacy against this Cooperia strain would have been considerably lower and the level of resistance demonstrated substantial. The findings however are considered entirely consistent with an ML resistant strain of Cooperia oncophora and supports the test composition's claim of efficacy against ML resistant Cooperia strains. A less common finding with Bomectin Gold in this study was the incomplete control of Ostertagia ostertagi (95.4% adult, 94.8% L4, AM). Typically the efficacy of ML pour-ons including ivermectin against Ostertagia spp is extremely high (>98%). As the most pathogenic worm genera in cattle this finding is of concern, whether it is the effect of ineffective skin absorption, or evidence of emerging resistance or tolerance by the parasite. It does however demonstrate the benefit of combination anthelmintics in delivering very high efficacy, which reduces the selection for potentially resistant worm strains [0441] The Test composition was well tolerated including at the pour-on site. Some initial reaction and awareness to the application of the pour-on including licking at the application site was seen in occasional animals but this passed rapidly, and by 10 to 15 minutes the test composition treated calves were grazing normally. Mild scurf and some exfoliation of the superficial epidermis was seen at Day 6 post treatment, more particularly at the withers or sometimes mid-back, but this was resolving and the underlying skin was intact, at the time of slaughter (Day 12 post-treatment) without treatment or negative effects on behaviour. The skin reaction was considered mild and within the range of skin reactions observed for the reference product Eclipse pour-on. It is speculated because of the similarly of the skin reactions in these pour-ons that this reaction may be related to the levamisole base which both pour-ons contain. All behavioural observations and clinical measurements relative to the controls showed no differences that could be attributed to the Test composition treatment. Despite Bomectin Gold pour-on being apparently a better tolerated, formulation based on skin observations and measurement, this was not supported by observational data. There appeared to be avoidance behaviour of bright sunlight by Bomectin Gold pour-on treated animals, which possibly negatively impacted grazing behaviour for up to 11 days. This was not observed for either the Test composition or the reference combination pour-on, or the untreated controls. 11. Summary [0442] The studies have demonstrated that the test composition is ■ highly effective (>99%) against resident parasites in the abomasum, small instestine and large intestine. ■ effective on ML-resistant Cooperia, [0443] The studies have also demonstrated that the test composition is not affected by ■ rain 2 hours after treatment, ■ breed, or ■ summer/winter coat. [0444] The results also showed that the test composition did not perform significantly different to the orally administered Eclipse product.
