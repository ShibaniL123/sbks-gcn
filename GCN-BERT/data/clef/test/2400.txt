Step 2: Preparation of trans-N-(3-amino-2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(4-fluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamide. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride solution (4.0 M in dioxane; 0.326 mL, 1.305 mmol) was added to a suspension of trans-tert-butyl-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-N-[3-(5-(3-(4-fluoro 3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2,2-dichlorocyclopropane-1-carboxamido)-2-chlorobenzamido)-2,6-difluorophenyl]carbamate (0.104 g, 0.130 mmol). The suspension was stirred at 24Â° C. for 12 hours. The dichloromethane was then removed under a stream of nitrogen and the sample was dissolved in ethyl acetate (20 mL) and washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (5 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (5 mL). The ethyl acetate solution was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum on a rotary evaporator. Purification of the residue with silica gel flash chromatography using 0-50% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent provided the title compound as a white foam (0.043 g, 53%).
