CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED CO-PENDING APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/704,800 filed Sep. 24, 2012 and entitled “SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AN INTERBODY SPINAL FUSION ASSEMBLY”, the contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a system and a method for an interbody spinal fusion assembly, and more particularly to an interbody spinal fusion assembly that includes an interbody cage, planar metal pins and bone engaging fasteners. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fibula strut grafts have a proven history of effectiveness for anterior cervical corpectomies but are inherently vulnerable to complications such as early or late fracture, dislodgement, displacement, telescoping into the vertebral body, or nonunion. The settling and resultant segmental kyphosis after multi-level anterior cervical reconstruction have also been documented. The risk of graft migration, displacement, or fracture appears more likely with more vertebral bodies removed and longer grafts, and with corpectomies involving a fusion ending at the C7 vertebral body. Newer interbody stabilization options have emerged such as polyetherketone (PEEK) which have the advantages of greater endplate coverage leading to a more stable construct and with similar modulus of elasticity as bone. However, PEEK cages tend to move out of position and usually require separate fixation plates. Other options include metal expandable cages but these can be bulky, risk adjacent body fracture, and have limited room for bone graft, and therefore, do not provide the most ideal biologic environment.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an interbody spinal fusion assembly that includes an interbody cage, planar metal pins and bone fasteners. The interbody cage is inserted in the space between two adjacent vertebras and is secured in placed with metal planar pins and bone engaging fasteners. Referring to FIG. 1, FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, interbody spinal fusion assembly 100 includes an interbody cage 110, planar pins 130a, 130b and bone engaging fasteners 140a, 140b. Interbody cage 110 includes a metal cage 112 and an insert 120. Insert 120 is made of PEEK or other plastic material and is positioned within a slot 114 formed at the front side 112a of the metal cage 112. Metal cage 112 is made of titanium, steel, or any other biocompatible metal or alloy. Insert 120 is secured to the metal cage 112 with a pin 150 positioned within through opening 115 of the metal cage and through opening 125 of the insert. Referring to FIG. 4A-FIG. 4D, metal cage 112 has a slot opening 114 in the front side 112a, slot opening 118 in the back side 112b, depressions 111 on the top and bottom surfaces, and through openings 117a, 117b starting in the back side 112b and extending diagonally toward the bottom and top surfaces 112f, 112e, respectively. Through openings 117a, 117b are dimensioned to receive the bone engaging fasteners 140a, 140b, respectively. Metal cage 112 also includes a through opening 116 having a rectangular perimeter and extending from the top surface 112e to the bottom surface 112f. There is also a pin receiving opening 115, as was mentioned above. Slot opening 114 is shaped and dimensioned to receive insert 120 which has a complementary shape and dimensions. Slot opening 118 is formed in the back side 112b and is shaped and dimensioned to receive the two planar pins 130a, 130b. The left and right inner sides of opening 118 include top and bottom upward and downward curved grooves 119b, 119d and 119a, 119c, respectively. The left and right inner sides of opening 118 also include central grooves 119e, 119f and openings 119g, 119h, respectively. Planar pins 130a, 130b are curved downwards and upwards, respectively, and their sides are dimensioned to slide within grooves 119a, 119c, and 119b, 119d, respectively. The top and bottom surfaces 112e, 112f of the metal cage 112 have bone engaging teeth 113. Planar pin 130a is made of metal and includes a downward curved body 132a having a rectangular central through opening 133a and a central pin 138a. Central pin 138a extends from the front surface of the planar pin 130a within the central opening 133a and has a distal end that projects in a direction opposite to the curvature of the planar pin 130a and engages the protrusion 111 in the bottom surface of the metal cage 112, when the metal planar pin 130a is in the “engaged position”. The front end 134a is trapezoid shaped with the shortest side being in the front. The side surfaces 135a, 135b are partially smooth in order to facilitate sliding within grooves 119a, 119c. The front portion of side surfaces 135a, 135b includes teeth 136. The edges of the top surface also include teeth 137. Similarly, planar pin 130b is made of metal and includes an upward curved body 132b having a rectangular central through opening 133b and a central pin 138b extending from the front surface within the central opening 133b. Central pin 138b extends from the front surface within the central opening 133b and has a distal end that projects in a direction opposite to the curvature of the planar pin 130b and engages the protrusion 111 in the top surface of the metal cage 112, when the metal planar pin 130b is in the “engaged position”. The front end 134b is trapezoid shaped with the shortest side being in the front. The side surfaces 135a, 135b are partially smooth in order to facilitate sliding within grooves 119b, 119d. The front portion of side surfaces 135a, 135b includes teeth 136. The edges of the top surface also include teeth 137. In the “non-engaged” configuration pins 130a, 130b are parallel to each other and are stored within opening 118 of the metal cage 112, as shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 5A. In the “engaged” configuration pin 130a is curved downward and pin 130b is curved upward, and their front ends 134a, 134b project out of the metal cage 112, as shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 5B. The front ends 134a, 134b and the teethed front sides 135a, 135b engage the superior and inferior vertebral endplates, respectively. In operation, interbody cage 110 including the metal cage 112, the insert 120 and planar pins 130a, 130b is inserted within an intervertebral opening between two adjacent vertebras. A special inserter 180 is used to insert the interbody cage 110 within the intervertebral opening. Next, the inserter 180 pushes the back of the top and bottom pins 130b, 130a, and moves them upward and downward, respectively. The top and bottom pins 130b, 130a slide forward within grooves 119b, 119d and 119a, 119c, respectively, and engage the top vertebral endplate and the bottom vertebral endplate with their front ends 134b, 134a, and teethed front side surfaces 136b, 136a, respectively. Next, the two bone fasteners 140a, 140b are inserted into the interbody cage openings 117a, 117b, respectively, and they are screwed into the vertebral bodies. Bone fastener 140a is directed diagonally toward the bottom surface of the interbody cage 112 and engages the adjacent bottom vertebral body. Bone fastener 140b is directed diagonally toward the top surface of the interbody cage 112 and engages the adjacent top vertebral body. In summary, the interbody cage 110 is secured in the intervertebral opening with the two bone engaging fasteners 140a, 140b and with the two metal planar pins 130a, 130b. A special removal tool 190 is used to disengage the planar pins 130b, 130a from the vertebral endplates, as will be described below. Referring to FIG. 6, inserter tool 180 includes a cannula 182, an impactor 184, a stop shaft 183, and a handle 186. Cannula 182 has an elongated body 182c with a central bore opening 182d and a rectangular cross section and terminates in two parallel distal extensions 182a, 182b extending from the distal end of the elongated body 182c. Impactor 184 slides within the cannula bore opening 182d slides impactor 184. Handle 186 surrounds the proximal end of the cannula 182 and is secured to it with a pin 181. Impactor 184 includes an elongated body 184c terminating in two parallel blades 184a, 184b. An impactor cap 185 is attached to the proximal end of the impactor elongated body 184c. Impactor cap 185 is used to push the impactor 184 forward. The cross section of the impactor's elongated body 184c matches the cross section of the cannula bore opening 182d and the two parallel blades 184a, 186b are oriented parallel to the distal extensions 182a, 182b of the cannula 182. Distal extensions 182a, 182b include trapezoid shaped ends 192a, 192b terminating in outward pointing tips 193a, 193b, respectively. Cannula 182 attaches to insert 100 by sliding distal extensions 182a, 182b into central grooves 119e, 119f of the insert 100 and inserting tips 193a, 193b into openings 119g, 119h, respectively. Once cannula 182 is attached to insert 100, the inserter 180 is used to guide and place the insert 100 in the prepared intervertebral opening between two adjacent vertebras. After placing the insert 100 in the intervertebral opening, the impactor cap 185 is pushed forward to move blades 184a, 184b forward and thereby to push planar pins 130a, 130b downward and upward within grooves 119a, 119c and 119b, 119d, respectively. Stop shaft 183 is oriented parallel to the cannula 182 and impactor 184 and includes ratchet grooves 183a at the proximal end and a curved front end 183b at the distal end. The position of the stop shaft 183 is adjusted via the ratchet grooves and is set at a fixed distance 195 from the intervertebral opening. Stop shaft 183 prevents overextending the cannula 182 past the set fixed distance 195. Pins 130a, 130b are moved in the “non-engaged” position by inserting a removal tool 190 into openings 133a, 133b, respectively. Removal tool 190 includes an elongated shaft 192 having a handle 192a at the proximal end a hook 192b at the distal end, as shown in FIG. 9A, FIG. 9B, FIG. 10A, FIG. 10B. Hook 192b is shaped and dimensioned to fit within openings 133a, 133b of planar pins 130a, 130b, respectively, and thereby attaches the hook tool to the planar pins. Once the hook tool 190 is attached to the planar pins 130a, 130b, it is pull back to move the planar pins 130a, 130b back into the “non engaged position”, as shown in FIG. 9B. In another embodiment, planar pins 230a, 230b include a center link member 235, as shown in FIG. 11A, FIG. 11B and FIG. 12. In this embodiment, each of the planar pins 230b, 230a, includes an upward or downward curved body 132a having a rectangular central through openings 233a. The front end 234a is trapezoid shaped with the shortest side being in the front. The side surfaces 235a, 235b are partially smooth in order to facilitate sliding within grooves 119a, 119c. The front portion of side surfaces 235a, 235b includes teeth 136. Center link member 235 slides between planar pins 230a, 230b and connects them. Center link member 235 includes a threaded through opening 236 and upward and downward extensions 237a, 237b. Extensions 237a, 237b are inserted into the central openings 233a of the planar pins and thereby engage the planar pins. An inserter tool (not shown) with a threaded distal end is inserted into the threaded opening 236 and is used to move the planar pins 230a, 230b simultaneously forward or backward into the “engaged” or “non-engaged” positions, respectively. Referring to FIG. 13A, FIG. 13B, FIG. 13C, FIG. 14A, FIG. 14B and FIG. 15A-FIG. 15C, in another embodiment, the intervertebral cage 250 includes a body made of PEEK and has two slots 252a, 252b extending from the front 250a (proximal side) of the cage toward the center and a central through bore 255 extending from the top surface 250c to the bottom surface 250d of the cage 250. Two planar pins 240a, 240b with downward and upward curved bodies, respectively, are inserted into the slots 252a, 252b, with a helical inserter 245. Helical inserter 245 includes an elongated shaft 246 and a threaded conical distal end 245a. Each of the planar pins 240a, 240b includes a center slot 242 with inner teeth 243. As the helical inserter 245 is rotated, the threaded conical distal end 245a contacts the inner teeth 243 of the corresponding planar pins 240a, 240b and thereby engages them distally and moves them simultaneously forward into the corresponding slots 252a, 252b of the cage 250. Referring to FIG. 16A, FIG. 16B, FIG. 16C, FIG. 16D, in another embodiment, the intervertebral cage 260 includes a body made of PEEK and has a slot 262, extending from the front 260a (proximal side) of the cage toward the center and a central through bore 265 extending from the top surface 260c to the bottom surface 260d of the cage 260.
