Intermediate 40: 8-Bromo-7-methyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine
To a microwave vial charged with EtOH (2.5 mL) were added 3-bromo-4-methylpyridin-2-amine (250 mg, 1.34 mmol) and 3-bromo-1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-one (0.28 mL, 2.7 mmol). The vial was capped and heated to 160° C. in the microwave for 60 minutes. The reaction mixture was diluted with H2O and extracted with DCM (×3). The combined organic extracts were dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-25% EtOAc/hexanes) provided the title compound as a colorless solid (240 mg, 64% yield).
