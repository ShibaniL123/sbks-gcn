CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of the German patent application No. 10 2012 020 300.4 filed on Oct. 17, 2012, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by way of reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a method for using the waste heat from a plant for producing cement, wherein heat of a process gas is used for heating water vapor via a heat exchanger, and wherein the plant for producing cement has at least one calcinator and at least one heat exchanger, which consists of a sequence of cyclones, for heating raw meal, and to a plant for producing cement, wherein the plant for producing cement has at least one calcinator and at least one heat exchanger, which consists of a sequence of cyclones, for heating raw meal. Plants for producing cement generally handle large amounts of heat. In order to use the waste heat of a cement plant efficiently, the waste heat produced in the process is returned to the process via heat exchangers that are distributed in the plant. In the return of the heat, the recovery, it is necessary that the heat is returned to the process at as high a temperature as possible, in order to reduce the necessary input of energy for generating the process heat. However, not all waste heat that is produced in the plant is suitable for recovery. Generally, only those sources of heat that have a temperature well above 300° C. are recovered. Apart from returning the heat to the process, it is also known to use the unrecovered, low-calorific heat for drying raw material or to use it for preparing fuels. Apart from the preparation of raw material and fuels, it has also become common practice to convert the unrecovered waste heat into electrical energy. In plants for producing cement, essentially two steam boiler systems are known for this. A first system is known as an SP boiler, from the concept of a “Suspension Preheater”, and this boiler is arranged downstream of the cyclone heat exchanger that is used in plants for producing cement for the preheating of the raw meal. A second system is known as an AQC boiler, from the concept of an “Air Quenched Clinker Cooler”, which is arranged downstream of a plant for producing cement in the exhaust air path of the clinker cooler. However, on account of the low temperature of the unrecovered waste heat, these known systems for converting waste heat into electrical energy generally have an undesirably low conversion efficiency. This is so because, the higher the temperature of the waste heat, the greater the capacity of a general thermal engine to convert heat into mechanical work, which in turn is converted by a generator into electrical energy. In order to improve the efficiency in the conversion of unrecovered waste heat into electrical energy in a plant for producing cement, it would consequently be necessary to create a source of waste heat that provides a much higher temperature than is known in known plants for producing cement. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the invention is therefore to provide a method and a corresponding plant for producing cement in which a source of waste heat of high temperature is available. According to the invention, it is proposed to remove the process gas from the plant for producing cement at the outlet of the calcinator and/or at the gas-side outlet of the first cyclone in the direction of gas flow in the heat exchanger. Heat is removed from this process gas in a steam boiler, and the process gas cooled in the steam boiler is then returned to the second or third cyclone in the direction of gas flow in the heat exchanger. Various locations at which hot process gases are available exist in a plant for producing cement. However, not all of these locations can be used as removal points for process gas, because this would disturb the intervention in the process for producing cement. It has surprisingly been found in prolonged series of tests that a removal of hot process gas at the outlet of the calcinator and/or at the gas-side outlet of the first cyclone in the direction of gas flow in the heat exchanger only has little influence on the process for producing cement. When removing an appreciable amount of process heat, it must be expected that, depending on the location of the removal, the preheating of the raw meal is only insufficient, and consequently the calcination reaction in the calcinator does not take place completely. If heat is removed in the calcinator, the calcination reaction could be incomplete, as a result of which the clinker as an intermediate product contains an excessive amount of free lime. Also, as from a certain dew point, salts that are present in the raw meal could fuse together and clog the plant for producing cement. Finally, the graduated combustion carried out in many plants for producing cement could be insufficient, and consequently the plant could emit an excessive amount of NOx. Also, controlled management of the combustion, with alternating reductive and oxidative conditions to avoid CO and NOx emission, could be disturbed by the removal of process heat. In order to return the process gas removed from the process to the process, it has proven to be advantageous if the cooled process gas is returned to the second or third cyclone in the direction of gas flow in the heat exchanger. According to the invention, therefore, a process gas circulation takes place, seen in the direction of gas flow, at the beginning of the heat exchanger and at the outlet of the calcinator in addition to the process gas flow in the plant. The process gas at the outlet of the calcinator and/or at the gas-side outlet of the first cyclone in the direction of gas flow in the heat exchanger has great amounts of dust. It is therefore necessary at least partially to remove the dust from the process gas. However, this removed dust is raw material, or partially to completely calcined intermediate product, and can be returned to the process. In order not to cool undesirably the unremoved process gas remaining in the process, in a refinement of the invention it is proposed to pass the separated and also cooled-down dust into a cement mill, where it is ground together with the fully burned clinker. However, it is also possible to charge the dust that is to be returned into the rotary kiln inlet chamber of the rotary kiln, in order to sinter the dust as an intermediate product in the rotary kiln. In order to control the amount of process gas removed from the process, according to the invention it is proposed to control the amount of gas by way of a control valve or a slide valve or a damper in the gas return, where the process gas is at least partially de-dusted. At this point the process gas is also cooled, thereby obviating the need for problematic control of the amount of gas with hot gas. The alternative removal of process gas for using the waste heat instead of using the low-calorific waste heat at the end of the heat exchanger or at the end of the clinker cooler allows the low-calorific waste heat to remain. In a particular refinement of the invention it is envisaged for the generation of electrical energy from the steam produced from low-calorific waste heat to heat up this steam, which is actually too cold, with the aid of the hot process gases, in order to increase the temperature of the steam produced with the waste heat from the heat exchanger and the clinker cooler. Heat from the process gas is combined with waste heat that is removed downstream of the heat exchanger on the gas flow side or downstream of the clinker cooler on the material flow side, in that the colder steam as a heat carrier is heated up further by the process gas heated up according to the invention. As a result, the waste heat of the plant for producing cement is used to the greatest possible extent. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention is explained in more detail on the basis of the following figures, in which: FIG. 1 shows a diagram of a plant of the type in question for producing cement with depicted removal locations for hot process gas according to the invention, FIG. 2 shows a plant according to the invention for producing cement in a first refinement, FIG. 3 shows a plant according to the invention for producing cement in a second refinement. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In FIG. 1 there is shown a diagram of a plant of the type in question for producing cement. Even though the structure of different plants differs, the sequence of the essential elements is comparable between various plants. In the plant as shown in FIG. 1, the raw meal to be thermally treated flows from the upper end of the heat exchanger 1 via the individual cyclones into the up to the second cyclone 1a. In a way not depicted here, the raw meal already preheated at this point flows into the rising branch 2 of the calcinator and is entrained there by the process gas and deacidified in the heat of the rotary kiln exhaust gases and additional firing in this part of the calcinator. Some plants have a swirl chamber 3, in which the process gases can burn out, in order to burn harmful exhaust gases oxidatively. After passing the swirl chamber 3, the calcined raw meal flows into the lowermost cyclone 1b, where it is separated and directed into the rotary kiln inlet chamber 5. The process gas is separated here from the calcined raw meal and rises up in the heat exchanger 1 for preheating the raw meal, where it flows counter to the raw meal. The raw meal introduced into the rotary kiln inlet chamber 5 then flows into the rotary kiln 6, where it is sintered into clinker. After the sintering, the clinker falls out of the rotary kiln 6 into the clinker cooler 8, where the freshly sintered clinker is rapidly quenched with the aid of cooling air. The cooling air heated up by the clinker in the clinker cooler 8 takes two paths. The first path leads as secondary air into the rotary kiln 6, whereas a second path leads via the tertiary air line 7 into the rising branch 2 of the calcinator. According to the invention, it is thus provided that hot process gas is removed at the gas outlet of the calcinator, in order to generate electrical energy from it. In the present plant, the gas outlet is arranged at the lower end of the rising branch 4 of the calcinator, where shortly thereafter the calcined raw meal is separated from the process gas. In FIG. 1, this point is provided with reference numeral 10. An alternative or cumulative for the removal of hot process gas is the gas-side outlet of the first cyclone 1b in the direction of gas flow in the heat exchanger, which is provided with the reference numeral 11. The gas inlet of the second cyclone 1a or third cyclone, seen in the direction of gas flow, is used as the return location for the process gas removed and cooled in the steam boiler. The process gas removed and returned at the indicated points disturbs the process for producing cement only little or not at all. How the process gas is further handled is outlined in more detail in the next figure. In FIG. 2 there is shown a detail from FIG. 1 with a depicted steam boiler 21, which is intended for the removal of heat from the hot process gas. According to the invention, it is provided that process gas is removed at location 10 and/or 11 according to FIG. 1 and is fed in each case via a process gas line 20 to a steam boiler 21. There, the heat of the process gas is used for heating up steam and the cooled process gas flows via a process gas line 22 to a control device 23 and from there via a process gas line 24 to the location of the return, which in FIG. 1 is provided with reference numeral 12. The steam to be heated enters the steam vessel 21 in steam line 26 and leaves it again by the steam line 26. Since the process gas removed is laden with dust, in a refinement of the invention it is provided that the dust is at least partially separated from the process gas in the steam boiler 21 and removed from the steam boiler 21 via the de-dusting device 25. The dust thus obtained can optionally be introduced into the rotary kiln inlet chamber 5 and/or into a cement mill. In FIG. 3, finally, there is shown an overall diagram of a refinement of a plant for producing cement together with a flow diagram that represents the overall removal of process gas and its use. The plant for producing cement depicted at the bottom left corresponds to the plant according to FIGS. 1 and 2. What is important here is the flow diagram for the use of the waste heat. In this circuit, low-calorific waste heat at a low temperature is obtained at the upper outlet of the heat exchanger 1 in a heat exchanger 30 of its own and also obtained in a further heat exchanger 40 at the end of the clinker cooler 8. Both the waste heat from the heat exchanger 1 and the waste heat from the clinker cooler 8 are combined via the steam lines 30a and 40a and the waste heat thus obtained is introduced as preheated flow 21v into the steam boiler 21, where the process gas removed superheats the steam in. The superheated steam is passed from the steam boiler via the steam line 21n into a turbine 50, which is connected to a generator for generating electrical energy. The steam is cooled in the condenser 52, passes through an extraction fan 53, which is coupled to a chemical treatment stage 53a, and is compressed by a pump 54. After leaving the pump 54, the cooled steam divides into two branches, wherein a first branch is passed as the flow 30v to the heat exchanger 30 for using the waste heat of the heat exchanger 1 and a second branch is passed as the flow 40v for using the waste heat of the clinker cooler 8. The circuit according to the invention has the effect that the steam for generating electrical energy is first preheated by the waste heat at a low temperature and heated up further by the process gas removed, so that the steam is superheated, and correspondingly carries a high amount of energy, which can be used in the turbine by expanding and condensing in a way known per se. As is apparent from the foregoing specification, the invention is susceptible of being embodied with various alterations and modifications which may differ particularly from those that have been described in the preceding specification and description. It should be understood that I wish to embody within the scope of the patent warranted hereon all such modifications as reasonably and properly come within the scope of my contribution to the art. 1-10.
