RELATED APPLICATION This application claims priority of Chinese Application Number ZL201320389063.1, filed on Jul. 2, 2013; and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/842,659 filed on Jul. 3, 2013. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention describes a light-up balloon product, specifically a balloon with a Light Emitting Diode (LED) light source secured to the inside of the balloon. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Balloons are used as decorations in parties, meetings and ceremonies. They can be of different sizes, shapes and colors and can have prints on their surfaces. However, these types of balloons are only visible in daytime or environments with sufficient lighting. Such requirements limit the usage of balloons. To expand usage of balloons, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,204,740; 7,320,529 and 7,850,328 B2 described certain LED balloons that have LED devices mounted outside the mouth (openings) of the balloons to achieve certain illumination effects that are different from regular unlit balloons. LED balloons made using these techniques are different from regular balloons and have LED devices that are rather cumbersome and complicated. U.S. Pat. No. 8,297,778 improves upon the prior devices by securing a small LED to the interior of the balloon with a clip or O-shaped band on the exterior of the balloon. The problem, however, is that it is very difficult to connect the LED devices to the skin of the balloon. The LED device of U.S. Pat. No. 8,297,778 secures to the interior of the balloon using a clip or o-ring secured around the skin of the balloon from the exterior. Such a connection is difficult for manufacturing, creates an external O-ring visible on the balloons exterior, and puts unwanted stress on the skin of the balloon. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention describes a new method for the LED device to be attached to a balloon. A LED device with locking device is placed inside and at the bottom of a balloon (“bottom” refers to the side opposite the opening of the balloon). The locking device contains a hinged opening which contains a hollow cavity for receiving a “Filler.” The present Device uses a Filler, which can be a simple polymer bead or other small solid object. The preferred embodiment as shown in the accompanying figures uses a small spherical polymeric bead. The filler is pressed against the exterior skin at the bottom of the balloon, such that the skin of the balloon encloses the filler. The filler is than inserted into the hollow cavity of the locking device, on the exterior of the balloon. The locking device is then closed, trapping the filler and the skin of the balloon inside. The LED device is powered by batteries. An insulating strip is provided which prevents the batteries form creating a circuit, prior to use. The insulating strip has a tab which extends through the opening of the balloon, such that prior to use, the user pulls the tab, releasing the strip, allowing the batteries to come into contact completing the electric circuit and causing the LED to light-up. The LED and locking device will be fully concealed in the interior of the balloon, with no clamps or other parts visible on the exterior of the balloon. The balloons made from this new invention will function just like ordinary balloons, however they will have an illuminated LED on their interiors, causing the balloon to illuminate. In short, the present LED balloon invention described in this application includes a balloon, a filler and an LED device. The LED device has a locking device that will lock the filler objects together with the skin of a balloon, making the balloon, filler object and LED device inseparable parts of a light-up balloon design. The LED device described above contains batteries, LED lights and battery connector with a locking device. The batteries are placed inside the battery connector and are connected to LED lights through a wire or conductor. The locking device and the battery connector can be one piece (see FIGS. 1 and 2) or multiple pieces attached together (see FIGS. 3 and 4). The locking device can be attached to the battery connector through welding, plugging or other types of bonding mechanisms. Additionally, the locking device may have a T-shaped notch, while the plastic casing for batteries has corresponding guiding rails that conform to the T-shaped notch, securing the batteries in place. The guiding rails will fit securely and snugly within the T-shaped notch. The locking device has two parts. By closing the two parts, a cavity is formed that is capable of securing a filler and part of the skin of a balloon in place, thus securing the LED device to the interior of the balloon. It should be understood that the LED, locking device and battery compartment can be made of a variety of materials and shapes. The materials are preferable polymeric materials such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, nylon, ABS, polyester or some kinds of polyoxymethylene. The balloon mentioned here can be a latex balloon or any other type of balloon with a soft semi-resilient surface or skin. The filler can be a spherical, elliptical, cylindrical or other shaped filler, and be made of a metal, plastic or any other materials, though the preferred filler is a single polymeric bead.
