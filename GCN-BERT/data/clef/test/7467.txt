At RT, 0.82 ml (10.70 mmol) of TFA was added to a solution of 62 mg (0.11 mmol) of the compound from Example 108A in 2.3 ml of dichloromethane, and the mixture was stirred for 2 h. The mixture was then concentrated and repeatedly dichloromethane was added and the mixture was concentrated again. The residue was purified by preparative HPLC (Method 3). This gave 36 mg (65% of theory, purity 100%) of the title compound
