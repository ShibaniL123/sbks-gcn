OBJECT OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a breast implant, in particular a breast implant with anatomical morphology which has been especially conceived and structured in order so as to eliminate the problems of rotation which these implants present over the medium and long term. This is achieved by means of fixing the implant to the body of the patient with means suitable for allowing such fixing by means of simple suture points. The invention thus falls within the field of prosthetic surgery, and more specifically aesthetic breast surgery, such as augmentation mammoplasty and the reconstruction of the breasts following the removal of mammary glands due to any type of health problem or another type of problem. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Breast implants with anatomical morphology can be filled with silicone gel or physiological saline. In some cases, the filling is mixed, silicone gel and saline. The surface which surrounds this filling, whatever it may be, is called the cover. The cover is made by adding silicone layers and leaving them to dry. Each manufacturer has their own way of making the cover, although the standard is that the final surface in these anatomical implants is texturized. There are manufacturers who add a polyurethane cover to this texturization. In the case in which the anatomical implants are used as expanders with the aim of reconstructing the post-mastectomy breast, these have on their rear face a valve with a metallic component which allows their positioning from the exterior and the filling in series by means of transcutaneous injections. Smooth anatomical implants are not commercialized since their surface would not be adherent and they would have displacements or rotations in all cases. In the case of the texturized anatomical breast implants, the pore of the texturization itself produces an adherent effect which prevents rotations in some cases but not in all. The deeper the pore, the more aggressive the texturing, the greater theoretic adherence it would have, however, it would also have more problems over the medium and long term such as delayed seroma and capsular contracture. Therefore the ideal anatomical implant would be micro-texturized, however, these rotate with greater frequency although they have few incidences of capsular contracture and delayed seroma. The surgical technique wherein a dissection is entirely customized to the anatomical implants offers fewer rotations over the short and medium term. In many cases, although the surgeon carries out a dissection customized to the implant, there are factors inherent to the patient, such as the elasticity of the tissue or physical exercise which cause the dimensions of this pocket to become modified with time and thus cause rotations of the implants. On the other hand, the fact that these anatomical implants usually rotate, causes many surgeons all over the world to not use them regularly in spite of the fact that the aesthetic results are always more natural when the surgery is carried out with these implants compared to the results of other round implants. There are also no real statistics for the percentage of rotations or the average degree which an implant rotates since the manufacturing houses do not add any device to the anatomical implants which may facilitate the detection, from the exterior of the patient, of this hypothetical rotation over the medium and long term. All of the rotations of anatomical implants are resolved by a new surgical intervention when this rotation is not resolved by external maneuvers. In the majority of the cases, the external maneuvers do not resolve the rotation and the patient has to return for surgical intervention. In the cases of minor rotations, many times, these are tolerated because the deformity is minimal and the patients prefer to accept a minor deformity and thus avoid reintervention. Thus in the field of breast implants with anatomical morphology, there are currently two problems: The rotation of the implantsLack of means for allowing, from the exterior by way of a radiological exam or similar, to check whether the implant is positioned correctly or whether, on the contrary, it has rotated. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The breast implant which the invention proposes resolves in a fully satisfactory manner the problem previously set out, in the two aspect mentioned. To this end, the implant which is defined, proceeding from the classic structure of a breast implant with anatomical morphology, focuses its characteristics on incorporating new structures in the cover of the implant which serve as a mechanism for fixing said implant in its optimum position to the body of the patient, by means of simple suture points, preventing rotation over the medium and long term. More specifically, the cited structures consist of strips of the same material as the cover, that is to say, solid silicone, with the resistance and elongation properties inherent to the silicone of which the cover is made. These rectangular structures, duly fixed to the implant, for example by means of a sealing similar to that which occludes the filled pore located on the rear part, have a distal orifice which allows the passage of a suture point for fixing to the suitable tissue of the patient. The implant preferably has four fixing strips or structures, two on its front face and two on its rear face with a length of approximately 2 cm and a width of between 6 and 8 mm. According to another of the characteristics of the invention and in order to allow the external check of the position of the implant once it has been inserted, the implant includes a mark with a radiopaque biocompatible material base, for example titanium which is located on the tactile mark which conventional implants have at the lower pole which allows the position of the implant to be determined at any time by means of conventional radiology or any other suitable similar means. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS In order to complement the description which follows and with the aim of aiding a better understanding of the characteristics of the invention, in accordance with a preferred practical exemplary embodiment of the same, a set of drawings accompanies said description as an integral part thereof, in which the following is depicted in an illustrative and non-limiting manner: Figures 1 and 2 show respective schematic depictions of a breast implant with conventional anatomical morphology, the first in a frontal view and the second in profile or lateral view.Figure 3 shows a front elevation view of a breast implant made in accordance with the object of the present invention.Figure 4 shows a rear elevation view of the same implant of Figure 3.Figure 5 shows a profile view of the implant of Figures 3 and 4. PREFERRED EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT Based on the figures described, it can be observed how the breast implant which the invention proposes, depicted in Figures 3 and 5, is constituted by means of a body (2) with anatomical morphology, matching the breast implant of Figures 1 and 2 for a same patient in form and dimensions, that is to say, by means of an enveloping or hermetically closed cover which houses in its interior a filling of silicone gel and/or saline, which has an orifice (11) on the rear part for the silicone filling which is sealed at rear, defining a front face (2) and a rear face (3). In accordance with the invention, the body (1) of the implant includes on its frontal face two strips (5) of the same material as the cover, that is to say solid silicone, located at the lower level and in a simple symmetrical arrangement with respect to the imaginary vertical and medial axis of the implant, as observed in Figure 3, strips which by one of their ends (6) are fixed to the frontal wall (2) of the implant by means of a sealing and which, corresponding to their other end, includes two orifices (7) which allows the passage of a suture point. On the rear face (3) of the implant, the structure described is repeated, that is to say two other strips (8) are present fixed to the rear wall (3) of the cover and provide at one of their ends with respective orifices (9) for the passage of a suture point. As mentioned previously, the strips (5, 8) are basically rectangular and have a length of approximately 2 cm and a width of between 6 and 8 mm to offer good feel and resistance. The tissue to which said strips (5, 8) are fixed may be breast tissue, the pectoralis major muscle, the fascia of the pectoralis major muscle, the fascia of the anterior rectus muscle or the fascia of the intercostal muscles. The tissue used depends on the space where the implant is inserted, subglandular, subfascia or subpectoral or dual plane and on the approach for inserting them, periareolar or inframammary or even axillar. Lastly and complementary to the structure described, the breast implant which the invention proposes is capable of including a mark (10), with a radiopaque biocompatible material base, preferably on the tactile mark which the implants include at the lower pole, which allows the position of said implant to be known at any time by means of conventional radiology, mammography or scanner or ultrasound. Breast implant, which being of the type which has anatomical morphology, based on a silicon cover and a silicone gel filling and/or physiological saline, in which at least one of its frontal/rear faces includes complementary structures, in the form of strips (5-8) of the same material as the cover (2-3), in the form of strips solidly joined to the cover, characterized in that said strips are provided at one of their ends with an orifice for the passage of a suture point for fixing the implant to the tissue of the body of the patient. Breast implant according to Claim 1, characterized in that there are four fixing strips, two (5) on the frontal face (2) of the cover and two (8) on the rear face (3) of said cover, all (5-8) located on the lower half of the implant. Breast implant according to the preceding claims, characterized in that the fixing strips (5-8) have a noticeably rectangular contour, with a length in the order of 2 cm and a width of between 6 and 8 mm and are fixed to the cover (2-3) of the implant by means of a biological adhesive. Breast implant according to Claim 1, characterized in that corresponding to the tactile mark which these implants include at the lower pole, a second mark made of a radiopaque biocompatible material for example titanium, is included.
