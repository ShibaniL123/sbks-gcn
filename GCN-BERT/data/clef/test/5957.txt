Step 2. 3-Bromo-4-fluoro-2-methylbenzaldehyde
To a solution of (3-bromo-4-fluoro-2-methylphenyl)methanol (5.35 g, 24.42 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (120.0 ml) was added manganese dioxide (activated) (36.6 g, 379 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h. The mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite. The Celite pad was further rinsed with CH2Cl2. The combined filtrate was concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (120 g, 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the desired product as a yellow solid (4.427 g, 84%).
