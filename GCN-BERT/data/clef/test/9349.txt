Example 51
To a suspension of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.200 g, 0.816 mmol) and ({[(tert-butoxyl)carbonyl]amino}-methyl-1,3-thiazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.233 g, 0.856 mmol), and pyridine (0.30 mL, 3.670 mmol) in acetonitrile (8 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 1.70 mL, 2.851 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 50° C. for 5 days. The reaction mixture was quenced with sat. NaHCO3 and extracted with 8:2 dichloromethane/isopropanol mixture (3×20 mL). The combined organic layers were washed once with sat. NaHCO3, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography over silica gel using 95:5 dichloromethane/methanol to give tert-butyl ((4-methyl-5-((4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)carbamoyl)thiazol-2-yl)methyl)carbamate (0.291 g, 72%) as a yellow solid.
