[Step 2] Synthesis of N-(4-(hydrazinecarbonyl)benzyl)-N-phenylacetamide
Methyl 4-((N-phenylacetamido)methyl)benzoate (0.220 g, 0.776 mmol) synthesized in step 1 and hydrazine hydrate (0.733 mL, 15.530 mmol) were mixed in ethanol (10 mL), and the mixture was heated by microwave irradiation at 120Â°C for 2 hours, and then cooled down to room temperature to terminate the reaction. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 4 g cartridge; methanol/methylene chloride = from 0% to 15%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.145 g, 65.9 %) as a white foam solid.
