BACKGROUND ART T ermoset pressure- sensitive adhesives are used to bond, for example, automotive glass substrates to automobile parts. Examples of documents of reference for the field in question include PCT Publication WO/ 1995/013327 and PCT Publication WO/ 1998/021287. PCT Publication WO/1995/013327 discloses a method of imparting a permanent substrate with, topographical characteristics or protective characteristics, wherein the thermoset heat-sensitive adhesive that is used contains a photochemical reaction product of starting materials constituted by i) a prepolymer or monomer syrup containing an acrylate ester or a meihacryiate ester, ii) an epoxy resin, in) a photopoSymerization initiator, and iv) a thermally activated curing agent for epoxy resins. Publication WO/ 1998/021287 discloses a. phoiopolymerizable precursor of a thermally curable pressure-sensitive-adhesive, the precursor containing (i) a specific phoiopolymerizable component, (ii) a specific epoxy resin and/or monomer, (Hi) a specific photo initiator, and (iv) a specific nucleophilic latent curing agent. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIO Because various external forces act upon bonded parts in a wide range of environments from low temperatures to high temperatures, a high level of adhesiveness is demanded of thermoset pressure-sensitive adhesives in a wide range of environments. In addition, it is preferable for thermoset pressure-sensitive adhesives to have low fluidity as subsequent manufacturing steps may be impeded if thermoset pressure-sensitive adhesive is forced outside of the part when the part is being bonded. in one aspect of the present invention, a thermoset pressure-sensitive adhesive is provided that contains a tacky polymer, polyvinyl aeetal, an epoxy resin, and an epoxy resin curing agent. The tacky polymer is obtained by copoiymerizmg a first monomer constituted by at least one type of (meth)acrylate ester of a non-tertiary non-cyclic alcohol having 8 to 12 carbon atoms and having one (meth)acryloyl group, a second monomer having a nitrogen atom and an ethylenicaliy unsaturated group, and more than 0 parts by mass to no more than about 0.5 parts by mass of a crosslinkmg agent per a total of 1 0 parts by mass of the first monomer and the second monomer. In accordance with the present invention, a thermoset pressure-sensitive adhesive is provided that can exhibit a high level of adhesive strength (such as cleavage strength) against a variety of external forces in a wide range of environments from low temperatures to high temperatures (for example, from about 0°C to about 80°C). The thermoset pressure -sensitive adhesive can also exhibit low fluidity. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGS. 1A to 1 C are schematic il lustrations for describing a fluidity evaluation method.

The area increase rate (%) is calculated according to the following formula ( 1 ). Area increase rate (%) - SA/SB * 100 - 100 ( 1 ) SB represents the area of the thermoset pressure-sensitive adhesive before pressure is. applied thereto, and SA represents the area of the thermoset pressure- sensiti ve adhesive after pressure has been applied thereto. In this context, "area"' is the area of the surface of the thermoset pressure-sensitive adhesive to which pressure is applied. There is no particular limitation upon the area of the thermoset pressure-sensitive- adhesive before pressure is applied thereto; for example, the aim can be about 200 mm2. Note tha if the thermoset pressure- ensi tive adhesive has a thickness of less than 0.6 mm, multiple sheets of thermoset pressure-sensitive adhesive can be layered to a thickness of 0,6 mm before measuring the area increase rate as described above. If the thickness of the thermoset pressure- sensitive adhesive is greater than 0.6 mm, the adhesive can be adjusted to a thickness of 0.6 mm by cutting a portion, pressing, or the like before measuring the area increase rate as described above.

The specimen constituted by the glass substrate 6, the pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet l b, and. the steel button 5 was then drawn at a rate of 1 ,000 mm min in a direction horizontal to the surface of the glass substrate 6 (namely, the direction indicated by arrow B) by pulling a handle 7a of a fix ture 7 in a 0° atmosphere. The cleavage strength (unit: N) at this time was measured. High-temperaiure cleavage strength evaluation A pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet lb was .prepared similarly to the method used for the low-temperature cleavage strength evaluation described above.
