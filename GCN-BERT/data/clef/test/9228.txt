Step-5: Synthesis of N-(4-acetyl-3-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trifluoromethanesulfonamide
A solution of triflic anhydride (75.1 g, 0.266 mol, 1.5 eq.) in DCM (600 mL) was cooled to 0° C. Pyridine (21.4 mL, 0.266 mol, 1.5 eq.) was added dropwise with constant stirring over 30 min. The reaction mixture was stirred at same temperature for 1 h. A solution of 1-(4-amino-2-chlorophenyl)ethanone (30 g, 0.177 mol, 1 eq.) in DCM (400 mL) was added dropwise maintaining the temperature 0° C. with constant stirring over a period of 45 min. The reaction mixture was then allowed to come to RT and stirred for 1 h at RT. The reaction was monitored by TLC and NMR. Upon completion, ice water (500 mL) was added and the DCM layer was separated. The aqueous layer was again extracted with DCM (2×100 mL). The DCM extracts were combined washed with ice water (2×500 mL). The DCM layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure below 40° C. to obtain the crude product. Diethyl ether (200 mL) and pentane (600 mL) were added into the reaction mixture and stirred for 30 min. The reaction mixture was filtered and the mother liquor was concentrated and triturated in pentane to get 28 g (52.8%) of N-(4-acetyl-3-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trifluoromethanesulfonamide as a light pink solid.
