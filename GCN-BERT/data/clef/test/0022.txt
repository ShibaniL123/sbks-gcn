METAL ORGANIC FRAMEWORK. PRODUCTION AND USE THEREOF CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application 61/776,223, filed March 11,2013. This application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to porous metal-organic frameworks, and to methods of their production and use. Capturing harmful greenhouse gases, particularly CO2, from industrial effluents could contribute to the minimization of global C02 content. Porous solids capable of adsorbing C02 on their surfaces (physisorbing) have been identified as a possible alternative for the existing amine scrubbing process used for industrial C02 capture. In amine scrubbing, the C02 is chemically bonded (chemisorbed) to the amine to form a carbamate salt; regeneration of the sorbent requires cleavage of this bond. For capture from flue gas, two major challenges are to capture C02 at extremely low (0.1 bar) partial pressure and to exclude other major components such as N2 and H20. Importantly, compared to a chemically bonded entity, the weaker interaction of physisorbed C02 requires less energy to release the gas for future use or storage. Beyond the greater strength of the C02 binding interaction, the amine scrubbing process employs an aqueous amine solution so the total energy cost to release C02 and regenerate the sorbent includes heating the entire solution and water has a very high specific heat capacity. It is typically estimated that, to implement amine scrubbing at a coal-fired power plant, the plant would need to increase energy production by 30-40% to compensate for the C02 capture. The main benefit of a C02 physisorbing solid would be to reduce the C02 liberation energy due both to a weaker interaction of the gas and the absence of a supporting aqueous solution. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs)/porous coordination polymers (PCPs) are a class of network solids composed of organic spacers linking metal ions or metal ion clusters. They possess ordered (crystalline) structures permeated by pores able to adsorb gas molecules. The regularity of these materials makes them amenable to structural characterization by X-ray diffraction techniques. Detailed knowledge of pore size, shape and surface chemistry can provide greater insights to interpretation of adsorption isotherms. In principle, researchers are able to establish structure activity relationships and better design next generation materials. Water stability has been shown to be a weakness for many MOFs as even low amounts of atmospheric moisture can compromise the order and the porosity. Some very stable Zr carboxylate MOFs have been reported recently (MIL-140 series, UiO-66 series) but merging high capacity with high stability is still a challenge. Also, with regards to implementation of a capture material, it is difficult to generalize a set of ideal characteristics of the sorbent (pore sizes, heat of adsorption for C02, shape of isotherm). This is because the characteristics of the ideal sorbent would be specific to the capture system into which it is implemented, broadly pressure-swing, temperature-swing, or vacuum-swing technology. Moreover, the conditions for regeneration would best be dictated by the availability of low cost energy at the specific capture site and this factor would influence selection of the sorbent. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Disclosed herein is a metal-organic framework (MOF). The MOF has pores and the framework includes zinc ions, oxalate, and a cycloazocarbyl compound. The example describes a particular compound that has been shown to be capable of adsorbing gases, particularly carbon dioxide, and to do so to a greater extent than it adsorbs nitrogen. The compound has also been shown to be thermally stable, establishing its feasibility for use as a carbon capture agent.

In a specific embodiment, the cycloazocarbyl group is a group other than the 3-amino-1,2,4-triazolate. In a preferred embodiment, the cycloazocarbyl group is 1,2,4-triazolate.

The Examples A MOF having formula Zn2Tz20x (Τζ=1,2,4-triazolate, Ox = oxalate) was prepared in powdered form. Zinc oxalate (185 mg, 1.2 mmole) and 1,2,4-triazole (337 mg, 4.88 mmol) were added to water (4 mL) in a 23 mL Teflon™ liner for an autoclave. After about five minutes, methanol (6 mL) was added and mixture stirred for about an hour. The mixture was placed in an oven and the temperature ramped up to about 180°C over a two hour period. The temperature was held at about 180°C for about 48 hours, and then ramped down to ambient temperature over about 12 hours. The contents of the Teflon liner were filtered and washed with water (150-200 mL of water) taking care not to allow all the solid material to become dry. The material was washed with about 50-75 mL of methanol, and then vacuum filtered to dryness for about 20-30 minutes to obtain the powder. The material prepared by this method is designated CALF-20. Figure 1 shows representative the X-ray diffraction pattern of two samples the material obtained using this method. The adsorption isotherms of carbon dioxide were determined at different temperatures using CALF-20. Figures 2 and 3 show the isotherms of carbon dioxide, the adsorbed amounts of the gas being given in mmol/g of the material. The adsorption isotherms of the carbon dioxide and nitrogen were determined at different temperatures using CALF-20, with results obtained shown in Figure 4. As can be seen from the figures, the results obtained establish the feasibility of separating carbon dioxide from a gas mixture containing at least nitrogen by contacting a mixture of the gases with MOF material of the invention. The affinity of a particular gas for a MOF material can be determined by measuring the isosteric heat of adsorption at zero coverage. The results exemplified by Figure 5 show that a column made of the porous material of the invention is capable of adsorbing carbon dioxide. A MOF may be specifically designed to have a disproportionately high selectivity or affinity for a particular component of a mixture, particularly carbon dioxide, relative to other gases of a gaseous mixture. Hydrolytic stability of the MOF material was tested. 100 mg of the material in a glass vial was placed in a Teflon-lined reactor, in which 5 mL pure water was added outside the vial. The reactor was heated at 150°C for 24, 72 hours and 1 week. Results are shown in Figure 6. Nitrogen sorption is more sensitive to microstructure than C02 sorption and the isotherms obtained after this steam treatment show the capacity and internal surface area of the MOF are retained. Given that moisture is present in a flue gas and that steam is a potential route to regenerate the sorbent, this stability is significant and atypical of MOFs. One can also see from Figure 7 that the PXRDs of the materials taken after the various heat-exposure times that the MOF retains its structure i.e., is thermally and hydrolytically stable under the conditions tested. The specific surface area of native and steam-treated samples, as calculated using the Langmuir model is shown in Table 1.
