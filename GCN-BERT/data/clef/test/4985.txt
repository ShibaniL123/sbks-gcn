Botanical classification: Baptisia hybrid. Cultivar designation: ‘Lavender Rose’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of hybrid Baptisia plant, botanically known as Baptisia ‘Lavender Rose’ and will be referred to hereafter by its cultivar name, ‘Lavender Rose’. The new cultivar represents a new false indigo, an herbaceous perennial grown for landscape use. The new invention arose from an ongoing breeding program in a dedicated test plot in Glencoe, Ill. The objective of the breeding program is to develop novel interspecific hybrids of Baptisia that exhibit unique flower coloration, hybrid vigor, ease of clonal propagation, and desirable plant habits. ‘Lavender Rose’ was selected as a single unique plant by the Inventor in June of 2009 after evaluating seedlings that derived from a cross made in May of 2004 between unnamed plants of hybrid Baptisia from the Inventor's breeding program. The female parent was a seedling that derived from open pollination of an unnamed interspecific hybrid of Baptisia australis×Baptisia leucophaea. The male parent was an unnamed interspecific hybrid of Baptisia australis×Baptisia leucophaea. Asexual propagation of the new cultivar was first accomplished by stem tip cuttings under the direction of the Inventor in June of 2009 in Glencoe, Ill. Asexual propagation by stem shoot tip cuttings has determined that the characteristics of the new cultivar are stable and are reproduced true to type in successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The following traits have been repeatedly observed and represent the characteristics of the new cultivar. These attributes in combination distinguish ‘Lavender Rose’ as a unique cultivar of Baptisia. 1. ‘Lavender Rose’ exhibits an upright, vase-shaped plant habit at anthesis that becomes a broad, uniformly rounded mound as the growing season progresses.2. ‘Lavender Rose’ exhibits densely clustered green stems that do not lodge.3. ‘Lavender Rose’ exhibits racemes of flowers that are medium to dark violet-blue in color at anthesis and aging to a violet-purple color, depending on ambient temperatures.4. ‘Lavender Rose’ produces large flowers that are an average of 2.5 cm in width.5. ‘Lavender Rose’ exhibits dense foliage that completely masks the bases of the flowering stems at maximum foliage growth.6. ‘Lavender Rose’ exhibits a vigorous growth rate. The female parent of ‘Lavender Rose’ differs from ‘Lavender Rose’ in having a spreading, irregular and more open plant habit, in having stems that lodge, and in having flowers that are medium blue-violet in color. The male parent differs from ‘Lavender Rose’ in having an irregular plant habit that is taller than it is wide, in being larger in size, and in having less dense stems that tend to lodge after summer rains. ‘Lavender Rose’ can be most closely compared to the Baptisia cultivars ‘Royal Purple’ (U.S. Plant patent application Ser. No. 13/987,050)* and ‘Purple Smoke’ (not patented). ‘Royal Purple’ is similar to ‘Lavender Rose’ in having flowers that are dark violet in color and in having a plant habit that grows wider than tall over time. ‘Royal Purple’ differs from ‘Lavender Rose’ in having a vase shaped habit with broadly rounded irregular shaped head of foliage with flowering stems bases that are visible below the foliage, in having fewer flowers per raceme, and in having flowers that are persistently dark violet in color. ‘Purple Smoke’ is similar to ‘Lavender Rose’ in having flowers that are violet in color, in having a three week long flowering season that begins in mid-May, and in having a bushy rounded plant habit. ‘Purple Smoke’ differs from ‘Lavender Rose’ in having stems that are gray in color, in being taller and narrower in size, in rarely, if ever, producing fruit with viable seed, and in having readily visible bases of the flowering stems beneath the foliage. *Applicant gives Examiner permission to replace the U.S. Plant Patent Application No. with the U.S. Patent No. if applicable and delete this statement. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The accompanying colored photographs illustrate the overall appearance and distinct characteristics of the new Baptisia. The photographs in FIGS. 1 and 2 were taken of a plant four years in age and the photograph in FIG. 3 was taken of a plant 9 years in age as grown outdoors in a trial plot in Glencoe, Ill. The photograph in FIG. 1 provides a close-up view of an inflorescence of ‘Lavender Rose’. The photograph in FIG. 2 provides a side view of ‘Lavender Rose’ in bloom and illustrates the plant habit and flowering habit. The photograph in FIG. 3 provides a side view of the late summer foliage of ‘Lavender Rose’. The colors in the photographs are as close as possible with the photographic and printing technology utilized and the color values cited in the detailed botanical description accurately describe the colors of the new Baptisia. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PLANT The following is a detailed description of five year-old plants of the new cultivar as grown outdoors in a trial plot in Glencoe, Ill. The phenotype of the new cultivar may vary with variations in environmental, climatic, and cultural conditions, as it has not been tested under all possible environmental conditions. The color determination is in accordance with The 2007 R.H.S. Colour Chart of The Royal Horticultural Society, London, England, except where general color terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
