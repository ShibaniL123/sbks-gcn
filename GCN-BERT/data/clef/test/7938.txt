BACKGROUND The present embodiments relate generally to articles of footwear and including coverable motorized adjustment systems. Articles of footwear generally include two primary elements: an upper and a sole structure. The upper is often formed from a plurality of material elements (e.g., textiles, polymer sheet layers, foam layers, leather, synthetic leather) that are stitched or adhesively bonded together to form a void on the interior of the footwear for comfortably and securely receiving a foot. More particularly, the upper forms a structure that extends over instep and toe areas of the foot, along medial and lateral sides of the foot, and around a heel area of the foot. The upper may also incorporate a lacing system to adjust the fit of the footwear, as well as permitting entry and removal of the foot from the void within the upper. In some cases, the lacing system may include a motorized tensioning system. Components of a motorized tensioning system may include, for example, a motorized tightening device, a control board, and a battery. Each of these components may be incorporated into an article of footwear in various places. In some cases, these components may be mounted on an outer portion of the footwear upper. In such configurations, it may be desirable to celebrate the inclusion of these components on the footwear while concealing their outward appearance and protecting these components from damage. SUMMARY In some embodiments, the disclosed footwear may include individual covers configured to cover lace tensioning system components on the outer surface of the footwear upper. Such covers may include faceted surfaces configured to define a contoured cavity enclosing the tensioning system components. In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to an article of footwear, including a motorized tensioning system including a tensile member and a motorized tightening device attached to an outer surface of the article of footwear, the tightening device configured to apply tension in the tensile member to adjust the size of an internal void defined by the article of footwear. The article of footwear may also include a tightening device cover configured to be removably attached to the article of footwear over the tightening device. In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a motorized footwear lacing system. The system may include an article of footwear having a motorized tensioning system including a tensile member and a motorized tightening device attached to an outer surface of the article of footwear, the tightening device configured to apply tension in the tensile member to adjust the size of an internal void defined by the article of footwear. The system may also include a control unit and a power source incorporated into the motorized tensioning system, the control unit and the power source being attached to an outer surface of the article of footwear. Further, the system may include a first set of component covers configured to be removably attached to the outer surface of the article of footwear, the first set of component covers including a first tightening device cover configured to be removably attached over the tightening device, a first control unit cover configured to be removably attached over the control unit, and a first power source cover configured to be removably attached over the power source. In addition, the system may include a second set of component covers configured to be removably attached to the outer surface of the article of footwear, the second set of component covers including a second tightening device cover configured to be removably attached over the tightening device, a second control unit cover configured to be removably attached over the control unit, and a second power source cover configured to be removably attached over the power source. Also, the first tightening device cover may be interchangeable with the second tightening device cover, the first control unit cover is interchangeable with the second control unit cover, and the first power source cover may be interchangeable with the second power source cover. In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method of changing a lacing system of an article of footwear. The method may include providing an article of footwear including a motorized tensioning system attached to the article of footwear, the motorized tensioning system including a tensile member laced through eye stays in a lacing region of the article of footwear, a motorized tightening device configured to apply tension in the tensile member to adjust the size of an internal void defined by the article of footwear, a first tightening device cover removably attached to the article of footwear over the tightening device, and a second tightening device cover configured to be removably attached to the article of footwear, the second tightening device cover having a different exterior shape than the first tightening device cover. The method may also include removing the first tightening device cover from the article of footwear and removably attaching the second tightening device cover to the article of footwear over the tightening device.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION To assist and clarify the subsequent description of various embodiments, various terms are defined herein. Unless otherwise indicated, the following definitions apply throughout this specification (including the claims). For consistency and convenience, directional adjectives are employed throughout this detailed description corresponding to the illustrated embodiments. The term “longitudinal,” as used throughout this detailed description and in the claims, refers to a direction extending a length of a component. For example, a longitudinal direction of an article of footwear extends from a forefoot region to a heel region of the article of footwear. The term “forward” is used to refer to the general direction in which the toes of a foot point, and the term “rearward” is used to refer to the opposite direction, i.e., the direction in which the heel of the foot is facing. The term “lateral direction,” as used throughout this detailed description and in the claims, refers to a side-to-side direction extending a width of a component. In other words, the lateral direction may extend between a medial side and a lateral side of an article of footwear, with the lateral side of the article of footwear being the surface that faces away from the other foot, and the medial side being the surface that faces toward the other foot. The term “side,” as used in this specification and in the claims, refers to any portion of a component facing generally in a lateral, medial, forward, or rearward direction, as opposed to an upward or downward direction. The term “vertical,” as used throughout this detailed description and in the claims, refers to a direction generally perpendicular to both the lateral and longitudinal directions. For example, in cases where a sole is planted flat on a ground surface, the vertical direction may extend from the ground surface upward. It will be understood that each of these directional adjectives may be applied to individual components of a sole. The term “upward” refers to the vertical direction heading away from a ground surface, while the term “downward” refers to the vertical direction heading towards the ground surface. Similarly, the terms “top,” “upper,” and other similar terms refer to the portion of an object substantially furthest from the ground in a vertical direction, and the terms “bottom,” “lower,” and other similar terms refer to the portion of an object substantially closest to the ground in a vertical direction. The “interior” of a shoe refers to space that is occupied by a wearer's foot when the shoe is worn. The “inner side” of a panel or other shoe element refers to the face of that panel or element that is (or will be) oriented toward the shoe interior in a completed shoe. The “outer side” or “exterior” of an element refers to the face of that element that is (or will be) oriented away from the shoe interior in the completed shoe. In some cases, the inner side of an element may have other elements between that inner side and the interior in the completed shoe. Similarly, an outer side of an element may have other elements between that outer side and the space external to the completed shoe. Further, the terms “inward” and “inwardly” shall refer to the direction toward the interior of the shoe, and the terms “outward” and “outwardly” shall refer to the direction toward the exterior of the shoe. For purposes of this disclosure, the foregoing directional terms, when used in reference to an article of footwear, shall refer to the article of footwear when sitting in an upright position, with the sole facing groundward, that is, as it would be positioned when worn by a wearer standing on a substantially level surface. In addition, for purposes of this disclosure, the term “fixedly attached” shall refer to two components joined in a manner such that the components may not be readily separated (for example, without destroying one or both of the components). Exemplary modalities of fixed attachment may include joining with permanent adhesive, rivets, stitches, nails, staples, welding or other thermal bonding, or other joining techniques. In addition, two components may be “fixedly attached” by virtue of being integrally formed, for example, in a molding process. For purposes of this disclosure, the term “removably attached” shall refer to the joining of two components in a manner such that the two components are secured together, but may be readily detached from one another. Examples of removable attachment mechanisms may include hook and loop fasteners, friction fit connections, interference fit connections, threaded connectors, cam-locking connectors, and other such readily detachable connectors. A motorized footwear lacing system may include an article of footwear and a motorized tensioning system. The motorized tensioning system may include a tensile member and a motorized tightening device. In some embodiments, the lacing system may be provided as a kit of parts, including a container in which a pair of footwear, a pair of motorized tensioning systems, and a remote device may be provided. The tensile member may include a cord or other lace-like member that attaches to the motorized tightening device. In some embodiments, the cord may be laced through lace receiving members in a lacing region of the article of footwear. In some embodiments, the footwear may include one or more removable covers configured to be removably attached to the upper of the article of footwear over the components of the tensioning system. The motorized tensioning system enables relatively rapid tightening of the footwear. In addition, in some embodiments the tightening system may provide incremental tightening. Such incremental tightening may enable the user to achieve a predictable tightness for each wearing. In some embodiments, sensors may be included to monitor tightness. In such embodiments, the user may also achieve a predictable tightness. In some cases, using a motorized tightening device may remove dexterity issues that may occur with other tensioning technologies (pulling straps, Velcro, and other such manual closure systems). Such a design could improve the use of footwear for physically impaired or injured individuals who may otherwise have a hard time putting on and adjusting their footwear. Using the designs proposed here, footwear could be tightened via a push button or remote interface. In some embodiments, the tensioning system may be remotely controlled, for example by a bracelet or hand-held device, such as a mobile phone. In such embodiments, adjustments may be made without the wearer having to stop the activity in which they are participating. For example, a distance runner may adjust the tightness of their footwear without interrupting their workout or competitive event to bend over and adjust their footwear manually or by pressing buttons on the footwear to activate the motorized tensioning system. In addition, the tensioning system may also be configured to make automatic adjustments. For example, using tightness sensors, the system may be configured to maintain tightness during wear by adjusting tightness according to changes in the fit. For example, as feet swell during wear, the tensioning system may release tension on the tensile member, in order to maintain the initially selected tightness. Further, the tensioning system may be configured to adjust the tightness during use to improve performance. For example, as a wearer places loads on the footwear during an athletic activity, the system may tighten or loosen the tensile members to achieve desired performance characteristics. For example, as a runner proceeds around a curve, the tensioning system may tighten the footwear in order to provide additional stability and maintain the foot in a centralized position within the footwear. As another example, when a runner is running downhill, the tightening system may loosen the footwear to limit additional forces exerted on the foot as the foot tends to slide toward the front of the footwear during the downhill run. Numerous other automated adjustments may be utilized for performance. Such automated adjustments may vary for each activity. In addition, the type and amount of such adjustments may be preselected by the user. For instance, using the examples above, the user may select whether to tighten or loosen the footwear while proceeding around a curve. In addition, the user may select whether to utilize an automated adjustment at all during certain conditions. For example, the user may choose to implement the adjustment while proceeding around curves, but may opt not to utilize an adjustment when running downhill. FIG. 1 shows a motorized footwear lacing system 100. As shown in FIG. 1, system 100 may include an article of footwear 105. FIG. 1 shows a partial rear perspective view of footwear 105, the forefoot portion of which has been truncated for purposes of illustration. Footwear 105 may be any of a variety of footwear types, including athletic footwear, such as running shoes, basketball shoes, soccer shoes, cross-training shoes, baseball shoes, football shoes, and golf shoes, for example. In other embodiments, footwear 105 may be another type of footwear including, but not limited to, hiking boots, casual footwear, such as dress shoes, as well as any other kinds of footwear. Accordingly, the disclosed concepts may be applicable to a wide variety of footwear types. As shown in FIG. 1, footwear 105 may include an upper 110 and a sole structure 115 secured to upper 110. Upper 110 may include one or more material elements (for example, meshes, textiles, foam, leather, and synthetic leather), which may be joined to define an interior void 135 configured to receive a foot of a wearer. The material elements may be selected and arranged to selectively impart properties such as light weight, durability, air-permeability, wear-resistance, flexibility, and comfort. Upper 110 may define a throat opening 140 through which a foot of a wearer may be received into void 135. Sole structure 115 may be fixedly attached to upper 110 (for example, with adhesive, stitching, welding, or other suitable techniques) and may have a configuration that extends between upper 110 and the ground. Sole structure 115 may include provisions for attenuating ground reaction forces (that is, cushioning and stabilizing the foot during vertical and horizontal loading). In addition, sole structure 115 may be configured to provide traction, impart stability, and control or limit various foot motions, such as pronation, supination, or other motions. The configuration of sole structure 115 may vary significantly according to one or more types of ground surfaces on which sole structure 115 may be used. For example, the disclosed concepts may be applicable to footwear configured for use on any of a variety of surfaces, including indoor surfaces or outdoor surfaces. The configuration of sole structure 115 may vary based on the properties and conditions of the surfaces on which footwear 105 is anticipated to be used. For example, sole structure 115 may vary depending on whether the surface is harder or softer. In addition, sole structure 115 may be tailored for use in wet or dry conditions. Upper 110 may also form a lacing region 130. In some embodiments, lacing region 130 may be disposed in an instep region of footwear 105, as shown in FIG. 1. In other embodiments, the lacing region may be disposed on other portions of the footwear, such as the medial and/or lateral sides of the footwear. As further shown in FIG. 1, footwear 105 may include a plurality of lace receiving members 125 in lacing region 130. Lace receiving members 125 may be configured to receive a lace or tensile member for adjusting the fit of footwear 105. The arrangement of lace receiving members 125 in this embodiment is only intended to be exemplary and it will be understood that other embodiments are not limited to a particular configuration for lace receiving members 125. Furthermore, the particular types of lace receiving members 125 illustrated in the embodiments are also exemplary and other embodiments may incorporate any other kinds of lace receiving members or similar lacing provisions. In some other embodiments, for example, footwear 105 may include traditional eyelets. Some examples of lace guiding provisions that may be incorporated into the embodiments are disclosed in Cotterman et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2012/0000091, published Jan. 5, 2012 and entitled “Lace Guide,” the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Additional examples are disclosed in Goodman et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2011/0266384, published Nov. 3, 2011 and entitled “Reel Based Lacing System” (the “Reel Based Lacing Application”), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Still additional examples of lace receiving members are disclosed in Kerns et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2011/0225843, published Sep. 22, 2011 and entitled “Guides For Lacing Systems,” the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Footwear 105 may also be configured with a motorized tensioning system 145. Tensioning system 145 may comprise various components and systems for adjusting the size of opening 140 and thereby tightening (or loosening) upper 110 around a wearer's foot. In some embodiments, tensioning system 145 may comprise a tensile member 120 and a motorized tightening device 150 configured to apply tension in tensile member 120. In some embodiments, tightening device 150 may be attached to an outer surface of footwear 105. For example, as shown in FIG. 1, in some embodiments, tightening device 150 may be attached to an outer surface 111 of upper 110. Tightening device 150 may be configured to apply tension in tensile member 120 to adjust the size of internal void 135 defined by footwear 105. In some embodiments, tightening device 150 may include provisions for winding and unwinding portions of tensile member 120. Tightening device may include a motor. In some embodiments, the motor may be an electric motor. However, in other embodiments, the motor could comprise any kind of non-electric motor known in the art. Examples of different motors that can be used include, but are not limited to: DC motors (such as permanent-magnet motors, brushed DC motors, brushless DC motors, switched reluctance motors, etc.), AC motors (such as motors with sliding rotors, synchronous electrical motors, asynchronous electrical motors, induction motors, etc.), universal motors, stepper motors, piezoelectric motors, as well as any other kinds of motors known in the art. Tensile member 120 may be configured to pass through various different lace receiving members 125 in lacing region 130. In some cases, lace receiving members 125 may provide a similar function to traditional eyelets on uppers. In particular, as tensile member 120 is pulled or tensioned, throat opening 140 may generally constrict so that upper 110 is tightened around a foot. Tensile member 120 may comprise any type of type of lacing material known in the art. Examples of lace that may be used include cables or fibers having a low modulus of elasticity as well as a high tensile strength. A lace may comprise a single strand of material, or can comprise multiple strands of material. An exemplary material for the lace is SPECTRA™, manufactured by Honeywell of Morris Township N.J., although other kinds of extended chain, high modulus polyethylene fiber materials can also be used as a lace. Still further exemplary properties of a lace can be found in the Reel Based Lacing Application mentioned above. The term “tensile member,” as used throughout this detailed description and in the claims, refers to any component that has a generally elongated shape and high tensile strength. In some cases, a tensile member could also have a generally low elasticity. Examples of different tensile members include, but are not limited to: laces, cables, straps and cords. In some cases, tensile members may be used to fasten and/or tighten an article footwear. In some embodiments, tensile member 120 may be provided in sections. For example, tensile member 120 may include a first tensile member portion 170. In addition, tensile member 120 may include a second tensile member portion 175. Also, tensile member 120 may include a third tensile member portion 176. Third tensile member portion 176 may be laced into footwear 105 through lace receiving members 125. First tensile member portion 170 and second tensile member portion 175 may be releasably fastened to third tensile member portion 176. For example, in some embodiments, tensile member 120 may include one or more quick release couplings 180, by which first tensile member portion 170, second tensile member portion 175, and third tensile member portion 176 may be releasably joined. Without first tensile member portion 170 and second tensile member portion 175 attached, third tensile member portion 176 may be used as, or be replaced by, a manual (i.e., traditional) shoelace. Couplings 180 may be readily decoupled manually, in order to enable removal of tensile member 120 from the article of footwear. Such manual decoupling may facilitate removal of the motorized tensioning system from footwear 105. This manual release mechanism may also enable the tension in the tensile member to be released in the event of a malfunction or low battery power. Exemplary manual release mechanisms may include any suitable connector types. In some embodiments, threaded connections may be utilized. In other embodiments the tensile member could utilize any other fastening provisions including a snap fit connector, a hook and receiver type connector, or any other kinds of manual fasteners known in the art. In some embodiments, tensile member 120 may be passed through lace receiving members 125 and may pass through internal channels within upper 110, between lacing region and tightening device 150, as shown in FIG. 1. In some embodiments, the internal channels may extend around the sides of upper 110 and guide tensile member 120 towards motorized tightening device 150, which may be mounted on a heel portion of upper 110, as shown in FIG. 1. In some cases, motorized tightening device 150 may include provisions for receiving portions of tensile member 120. For example, in some cases, end portions of tensile member 120 may pass through apertures in a housing unit of motorized tightening device 150. As further shown in FIG. 1, tensioning system 145 may also include a control unit 155 configured to control the operation of tightening device 150. In some embodiments, control unit 155 may be attached to the outer surface of footwear, such as outer surface 111 of upper 110. Control unit 155 may include various circuitry components. In addition, control unit 155 may include a processor, configured to control motorized tightening device 150. Control unit 155 shown in FIG. 1 is only intended as a schematic representation of one or more control technologies that could be used with tightening device 150. For example, there are various approaches to motor control that may be employed to allow speed and direction control. For some embodiments, a microcontroller unit may be used. The microcontroller may use internal interrupt generated timing pulses to create pulse-width modulation (PWM) output. This PWM output is fed to an H-bridge which allows high current PWM pulses to drive the motor both clockwise and counterclockwise with speed control. However, any other methods of motor control known in the art could also be used. Tensioning system 145 may also include a power source 160 configured to supply power to motorized tightening device 150. In some embodiments, power source 160 may include one or more batteries. Power source 160 shown in FIG. 1 is only intended as a schematic representation of one or more types of battery technologies that could be used to power motorized tightening device 150. One possibly battery technology that could be used is a lithium polymer battery. The battery (or batteries) could be rechargeable or replaceable units packaged as flat, cylindrical, or coin shaped. In addition, batteries could be single cell or cells in series or parallel. Rechargeable batteries could be recharged in place or removed from an article for recharging. In some embodiments, charging circuitry could be built in and on board. In other embodiments, charging circuitry could be located in a remote charger. In another embodiment, inductive charging could be used for charging one or more batteries. For example, a charging antenna could be disposed in a sole structure of an article and the article could then be placed on a charging mat to recharge the batteries. Additional provisions could be incorporated to maximize battery power and/or otherwise improve use. For example, it is also contemplated that batteries could be used in combination with super caps to handle peak current requirements. In other embodiments, energy harvesting techniques could be incorporated which utilize the weight of the runner and each step to generate power for charging a battery. As shown in FIG. 1, tensioning system 145 may include one or more electrical cables 165 extending between components of system 145. Electrical cables 165 may be configured to deliver electrical power, as well as electronic communication signals, between power source 160, tightening device 150, and control unit 155. In some embodiments, such electrical cables may be disposed under at least one layer of upper 110. In some embodiments, one or more components of tensioning system 145 may be removable from footwear 105. Providing motorized tensioning system 145 as removable from footwear 105 may enable footwear 105 to be used conventionally. In addition, removability of tensioning system 145 may enable components of tensioning system 145 to be repaired or replaced independent of footwear 145. In addition, removability of tensioning system 145 enables footwear 145 to be repaired or replaced independent of tensioning system 145. Provisions for mounting components of tensioning system 145 to outer surface 111 of upper 110 can vary in different embodiments. In some cases, motorized tightening device 150 may be removably attached, so that motorized tensioning system 145 can be easily removed by a user and modified (for example, when tensile member 120 must be replaced). For example, in some embodiments, components of tensioning system 145 may be removably attached to footwear 105 with a hook and loop fastener material. In other embodiments, components of tensioning system 145 may be removably attached to footwear 105 with a tongue and groove configuration. Further, in some embodiments, components of tensioning system 145 may be removably attached to footwear 105 with an interference fit or friction fit. The components of such a friction fit attachment may have any suitable orientation. Alternative types of removable connections are also possible including, for example, threaded fasteners, cam-lock fasteners, spring clip type fasteners, and other removable connection mechanisms. As shown in FIG. 1, tightening device 150 may be configured to be removably attached to a heel portion of footwear 105. For example, as shown in FIG. 1, in some embodiments, tightening device 150 may be removably attached to outer surface 111 of upper 110 in a rearmost portion of footwear 105. This positioning may facilitate the application of tension to tensile members on both a medial side and a lateral side of footwear 110. In other embodiments, however, any of these components could be disposed in any other portions of an article, including the upper and/or sole structure. In some cases, some components could be disposed in one portion of an article and other components could be disposed in another, different, portion. The location of a motorized tightening device can vary from one embodiment to another. The illustrated embodiments show a motorized tightening device disposed on the heel of an upper. However, other embodiments may incorporate a motorized tightening device in any other location of an article of footwear, including the forefoot and midfoot portions of an upper. In still other embodiments, a motorized tightening device could be disposed in a sole structure of an article. The location of a motorized tightening device may be selected according to various factors including, but not limited to: size constraints, manufacturing constraints, aesthetic preferences, optimal lacing placement, ease of removability as well as possibly other factors. In another embodiment motorized tightening device 150 could be disposed at the heel of an upper, while power source 160 and/or control unit 155 could be disposed with a sole structure of footwear 110. For example, in one embodiment the power source and control unit may be disposed under midfoot region of footwear 105 with a cable connection (or a simple electrical contact connection) to motorized tightening device 150, which may be disposed in the heel region of footwear 105. In still other embodiments, a power source and a control unit could be integrated into the motorized tightening device. For example, in some embodiments, both a battery and a control unit could be disposed within an outer housing of motorized tightening device 150. Further, in some embodiments, the locations of tightening device 150, control unit 155, and power source 160 may be rearranged. Control unit 155 is shown in the left side of footwear 105 in FIG. 1. Power source 160 is shown on the right side of footwear 105. The positions of control unit 155 and power source 160 may be reversed in some embodiments. However, it may be advantageous to locate the thinner component on the medial side of footwear 105. This may enable the tensioning system components to have a lower profile on the medial side than on the lateral side of footwear 105, which may minimize possible interference with footwear 105 on the other foot of the wearer. In some embodiments, motorized tightening device 150 may be configured to automatically regulate tension in tensile member 120 for purposes of tightening, loosening, and regulating the fit of upper 110. Embodiments can incorporate a variety of sensors for providing information to a control unit of a motorized tensioning system. In some embodiments an H-bridge mechanism may be used to measure current. The measured current may be provided as an input to the control unit. In some cases, a predetermined current may be known to correspond to a certain level of tension in the tensile member. By checking the measured current against the predetermined current, a motorized tensioning system may adjust the tension of the tensile member until the predetermined current is measured, which indicates the desired tension has been achieved. With current as a feedback, a variety of digital control strategies can be used. For instance, proportional control only could be used. Alternatively, PI control could be used or full PID. In cases some cases, simple averaging could be used or other filtering techniques including fuzzy logic and band-pass to reduce noise. Still other embodiments can include additional types of sensors. In some cases, pressure sensors could be used under the insoles of an article to indicate when the user is standing. A motorized tensioning system can be programmed to automatically loosen the tension of the lace when the user moves from the standing position to a sitting position. Such a configuration may be useful for older adults that may require low tension when sitting to promote blood circulation but high tension for safety when standing. Still other embodiments could include additional tension sensing elements. In one embodiment, three point bend indicators could be used in the lace to more accurately monitor the state of the tensioning system, including the lace. In other embodiments, various devices to measure deflection such as capacitive or inductive devices could be used. In some other embodiments, strain gauges could be used to measure tension induced strain in one or more components of a tensioning system. In some embodiments, sensors such as gyroscopes and accelerometers could be incorporated into a tensioning system. In some embodiments, an accelerometer and/or gyroscope could be used to detect sudden moment and/or position information that may be used as feedback for adjusting lace tension. These sensors could also be implemented to control periods of sleep/awake to extend battery life. In some cases, for example, information from these sensors could be used to reduce tension in a system when the user is inactive, and increase tension during periods of greater activity. Some embodiments may use memory (for example onboard memory associated with a control unit) to store sensed data over time. This data may be stored for later upload and analysis. For example, one embodiment of an article of footwear may sense and store tension information over time that can be later evaluated to look at trends in tightening. It is also contemplated that some embodiments could incorporate pressure sensors to detect high pressure regions that may develop during tightening. In some cases, the tension of the lace could be automatically reduced to avoid such high pressure regions. Additionally, in some cases, a system could prompt a user to alter them to these high pressure regions and suggest ways of avoiding them (by altering use or fit of the article). It is contemplated that in some embodiments a user could be provided with feedback through motor pulsing, which generates haptic feedback for the user in the form of vibrations/sounds. Such provisions could facilitate operation of a tensioning system directly, or provide haptic feedback for other systems in communication with a motorized tightening device. Various methods of automatically operating a motorized tightening device in response to various inputs can be used. For example, after initially tightening a shoe, it is common for the lace tension to quickly decline in the first few minutes of use. Some embodiments of a tensioning system may include provisions for readjusting lace tension to the initial tension set by the user. In some embodiments, a control unit may be configured to monitor tension in those first minutes to then readjust tension to match original tension. Components of motorized tensioning system 145 may have any suitable configurations. For example, components of motorized tensioning system 145 may have any suitable configurations disclosed in Beers, U.S. Pat. No. ______, issued ______ (now U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/032,524, filed Sep. 20, 2013; Attorney Docket No. 51-2829) and entitled “Footwear Having Removable Motorized Adjustment System,” the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Mounting the tensioning system components on the outer surface of the upper prevents these components from taking up space in other parts of the shoe, for example, between layers of the upper, or within the sole structure. In some embodiments, removable covers may be attached, covering the individual components of the tensioning system. These covers may enable the inclusion of these components on the footwear to be celebrated, while concealing their outward appearance. For example, the covers may be formed to have any desired appearance and, accordingly, may be used to conceal the appearance of the tightening device, control unit, and/or power source, for instance. In addition, such covers may protect these components from damage. As shown in FIG. 1, footwear 105 may include a tightening device cover 185 configured to be removably attached to footwear 105 over tightening device 150. In addition, footwear 105 may include a control unit cover 195 configured to be removably attached to footwear 105 over control unit 155, and a power source cover 190 configured to be removably attached to footwear 105. Tightening device cover 185, power source cover 190, and/or control unit cover 195 may be removably attached by any suitable mechanism. For example, as shown in FIG. 1, these covers may be removably attached to the article of footwear with an interference fit connection. Alternative removable connections may be used, such as hook and loop fasteners, threaded fasteners, press-fit connections, snap fit connections, or any other suitable removable connection. The tensioning system component covers may have any suitable shape. For example, as shown in FIG. 1, tightening device cover 185, power source cover 190, and/or control unit cover 195 may have faceted configurations. For purposes of this disclosure, the term “faceted” shall refer to the inner and/or outer surface of a cover being formed to have a plurality of planar surfaces (“facets”) arranged at various angles to one another like a gem. In contrast a “smoothly contoured” surface will be understood to have no adjacent planar surfaces, but instead smoothly curved surfaces. Further, in some embodiments, these covers may have polygonal outer edges. In some embodiments, one or more of these covers may have regular polygonal shapes. In some embodiments, one or more of these covers may have non-regular polygonal shapes. The faceted configurations may include faceted inner surfaces, which define concave contours configured to receive the tensioning system components. In some embodiments, one or more of the covers may be transparent or semi-transparent. For example, in some embodiments, one or more of the covers may be formed of a colored, translucent material. Colored, translucent covers having faceted configurations may have a gem-like appearance. Accordingly, utilizing such covers may provide a more aesthetically appealing configuration than a battery pack or circuit board, for example. In addition, such covers may also provide protection to the tensioning system components. The faceted configurations may provide the covers with increased strength over certain non-faceted configurations. FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of an exploded, side perspective view of footwear 105. FIG. 2 shows concave inner surface 200 of power source cover 190. As shown in FIG. 2, power source cover may have a faceted configuration.

In still other embodiments, any other kinds of remote devices could be used including remote devices specifically designed for controlling the tensioning system. The type of remote device could be selected according to software and hardware requirements, ease of mobility, manufacturing expenses, as well as possibly other factors. FIG. 9 is a schematic illustration of footwear 105 with a motorized tensioning system and a remote device 900 for controlling the tensioning system. In particular, FIG. 9 shows remote device 900 as a mobile phone. It will be understood that remote device 900 may be any suitable device for communicating with control unit 155. In some embodiments, the control unit may be configured to communicate with the remote device. In some cases, the control unit may be configured to receive operating instructions from the remote device. Accordingly, the remote device may be configured to communicate instructions to the control unit. Therefore, control unit 155 may be configured to receive instructions from remote device 900 to apply increased tension to the tensile member by winding the spool. In some cases, remote device 900 may be capable of receiving information from control unit 155. For example, remote device 900 could receive information related to the current tension in the tensile member and/or other sensed information. Accordingly, in some embodiments, remote device 900 may function as a remote control that may be used by the wearer to operate the tensioning system. Examples of different communication methods between remote device 900 and the tensioning system may include wireless networks such as personal area networks (e.g., Bluetooth®) and local area networks (e.g., Wi-Fi), as well as any kinds of RF based methods known in the art. In some embodiments, infrared light may be used for wireless communication. Although the illustrated embodiments detail a remote device that communicates wirelessly with the motorized tensioning system, in other embodiments the remote device and tensioning system may be physically connected and communicate through one or more wires. The disclosed lace adjustment system may be usable to perform a variety of functions related to the tensioning of the tensile member. The tensioning system components and the remote device may be configured to perform any of the operative functions described in Beers, U.S. Pat. No. ______, issued ______ (now U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/032,524, filed Sep. 20, 2013; Attorney Docket No. 51-2829) and entitled “Footwear Having Removable Motorized Adjustment System,” the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. FIG. 10 is a schematic illustration of an exploded, rear perspective view of footwear 105 with an alternative set of covers for the components of the tensioning system. As shown in FIG. 10, a second tightening device cover 1085 may be removably attached to upper 110 of footwear 105 over tightening device 150. Further, a second power source cover 1090 may be removably attached to upper 110 over power source 160. In addition, a second control unit cover 1095 may be configured to be removably attached to footwear 105 over control unit 155. As shown in FIG. 1, these second covers may be interchangeable with the faceted covers described above. As opposed to the faceted configurations described above, second tightening device cover 1085, second power source cover 1090, and second control unit cover 1095 may have substantially smoothly contoured outer surfaces. The substantially smoothly contoured outer surfaces may prevent edges of the covers from catching on the wearer's other shoe or on obstacles. For example, during athletic activities, smoothly contoured covers may be beneficial in preventing the wearer from catching a cover on the footwear of an opponent. When contact is made with a smoothly contoured cover, the cover may merely glance off, with little or no impedance to the motion of the wearer's foot. FIG. 11 is a schematic illustration of a rear view and partial cross-sectional view of footwear 105 with the second set of covers attached. As shown in FIG. 11, second tightening device cover 1085, second power source cover 1090, and second control unit cover 1095 may have smooth contours. As shown in the partial cross-sectional view in FIG. 11, second tightening device cover 1085 may have an outer surface 1110 having a smoothly contoured profile, that is, without facets. As further shown in FIG. 11, second tightening device cover 1085 may have an inner surface 1105 that is concavely contoured to define a cavity 1440 configured to receive tightening device 150. As also shown in FIG. 11, second tightening device cover 1085 may be configured to attach to outer surface 111 of upper 110 of footwear 105 with the same connection mechanism as the faceted tightening device cover discussed above. For example, in some embodiments, second tightening device cover 1085 may include a first post receiving cylinder 1430 configured to receive first attachment post 420 and a second post receiving cylinder 1435 configured to receive second attachment post 425 of upper 110 in an interference fit or friction fit connection. FIG. 12 is a schematic illustration of motorized footwear lacing system including 1200 including interchangeable tensioning system component covers.
