GOODS DELIVERY SYSTEM FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to the field of goods delivery systems. BACKGROUND Delivery is the process of transporting goods from a source location to a predefined destination. There are different delivery types. Cargo (physical goods) is primarily delivered via roads and railroads on land, shipping lanes on the sea and airline networks in the air. The general process of delivering goods is known as distribution. The study of effective processes for delivery and disposition of goods and personnel is called logistics. Firms that specialize in delivering commercial goods from point of production or storage to a point of sale are generally known as distributors, while those that specialize in the delivery of goods to the consumer are known as delivery services. Postal, courier, and relocation services also deliver goods for commercial and private interests. In the delivery process, a distribution center may be in use, which may include a warehouse for storage of goods. Distribution centers are usually large plain buildings in industrial areas. The delivery process may be executed using courier services; the courier delivers packages and mail. Couriers are distinguished from ordinary mail services by features such as speed, security, tracking, signature, specialization and individualization of express services, and swift delivery times. As a premium service, couriers are usually more expensive than standard mail services, and their use is typically restricted to packages where one or more of these features are considered important enough to warrant the cost. The foregoing examples of the related art and limitations related therewith are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of the related art will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon a reading of the specification and a study of the figures.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Disclosed herein is a system for physical delivery of goods. The system may include multiple deposit boxes distributed between different shopping locations, such as retail stores, shopping malls, etc. The deposit boxes may be connected, over a network, to a central server which manages the delivery of the goods. The server may be accessible to users in one or more distribution facilities and/or to individual messengers. After a shopper purchases goods at shopping locations, he or she may deposit them in one of the deposit boxes. The depositing may be inside a dedicated container, such as a bag, a box or the like. The container may be uniquely encoded using, for example, a code printed on the container, adhered to the container using a sticker, provided in a radio tag attached to the container, etc. In the depositing process, the user may be required to identify and to provide a destination for the delivery of the goods. The depositing process may be carried out by a computerized device associated or being part of the deposit box. The deposit box may communicate with the server, such that the server is informed of the contents of the box as well as to delivery tasks resulting there from. The one or more distribution facilities and/or the individual messengers may utilize that information from the server in order to carry out the delivery task, namely - to arrange for picking up the deposited goods from the deposit box and delivering them to the destination. Reference is now made to Fig. 1, which shows a network diagram of an exemplary system 100 for physical delivery of goods. System 100 may include multiple deposit boxes, for example three deposit boxes 102, 104, 106; a server 108; an optional distribution center 110; and delivery vehicles, for example delivery vehicles 112, 114, 116. System 100 may be used by multiple shoppers, for example shoppers 118, 120, 122, who may use it with multiple smart bags, for example three smart bags 124, 126, 128. For simplicity of discussion, the following description will relate only to deposit box 102, shopper 118, smart bag 124 and vehicle 112, but is similarly applicable to the other deposit boxes, shoppers, smart bags and vehicles.
