Intermediate 41: Ethyl 7-chloro-2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxylate
Step A: 2-Chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium-1-amine 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate. To a mixture of TFA (80 mL, 104 mmol) and H2O (8.2 mL) was added ethyl (1E)-N-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)sulfonyloxyethanimidate (15 g, 52.6 mmol) at −5° C. and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1.5 h. To the reaction mixture was added ice water (150 mL). The precipitate was collected and washed with water (20×50 mL). The white solid was dissolved in DCM (250 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and filtered. The filtrate was cooled to 0° C. and to this solution was added dropwise 2-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine (9.6 g, 52.9 mmol). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to rt and stirred for 22 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with Et2O (800 mL) and the precipitate was collected. The solid was washed with Et2O (100 mL) and dried in vacuo. The crude product was triturated with Et2O (100 mL) to give the title compound (6.18 g, 30%) as a white crystalline solid.
