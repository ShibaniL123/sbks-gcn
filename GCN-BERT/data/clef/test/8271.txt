IN U.$,A 536 ' 4 3 This invention relates to a method of shortening the required time of plasticizing those natural rubbers and vulcanizable synthetic rubber-like polymers and copolymers which are plasticized by oxygen; to the materials so plasticized and to a novel type of catalytic plasticizing or "peptizing,, agent for the purpose. In the manufacture of mobber goods, efficient processin i.e., milling, calendering, extruding, molding and the like, requires that the rubber be plasticized. This is done in order that production schedules can be met with fewer defective products and with reasonable charges for power, labor and equipment.' As a consequence, the plasticizing of rubber has become in itself a highly developed art. Early in the development of the art it was found that most of the natural rubbers can be plasticized by the action of air or oxygen under suitable conditions. Most commonly this was done by heating while mechanically Working in the presence of air. The action has been shown to be due to an oxidation reaction. Later it was found that small amounts of added chemicals, such as some of the aromatic meroaptans and certain nitroso compounds, could be added to rubber under various conditions to produce more rapidly the desired effect. While the exact nature of their action is not completely understood, the use of such catalytic plasticizers of "paptizers" has become well known. In the past, the available plasticizer have been objectionable from one or more of several different causes. The principal difficulty with many of the materials proposed for the purpose was that they also operated as either skin irritants or skin sensitizers, resulting in objections from those who are obliged to handle the material. Other materials were characterized by very disagreeable odors, island of the commonly used materials were subject to both'. As a result of these objectionable features, the use of plasticizers tended to be limited in spite of the wide demand for materials for the purpose. • • u .: : i :i!ii)): I '!iii¸ /zI ii! i :ii fill 3(i3 43 When additional problems arose of handling synthetic rubber-llke polymers, such for example as the vulcanized copolymers of butadiene and styrene or of butadiene and acrylonitrile, processing difficulties became much more pronounced. Many of the synthetic rubbers were found to be much more difficult to plasticize than natural rubber. Therefore, the demand for effective plasticizers or "peptizers", not subject to the objectionable physiological properties of the materials previously used, was markedly increased° It is, therefore, the principal object of the present invention to develop plasticized rubber compositions which are not subject to the objectionable features such as those which characterized the materials of the prior art. It is also an object of the invention to develop plasticízers or peptlzers which are: easily and readily obtained; do not possess or impart objectionable odors; in the handling, do not produce a sensitization or irritation of the skin; and are suitable for use with any natural and synthetic rubber-like polymers capable of being plasticized by oxidation. A still further and net the least important object of the present invention is to develop milling procedures using the new peptizers whereby the time consumed may be either less than the time required under previous practices or in which a softer rubber can be prepared in the same time. These novel catalytic agent may be represented generically by the type formula »;herein ROC is the residue of a heteroeyclic carboxylic acid. While R may be any fiveor six-membered, mononuclear, heterocyclic radical, in this invention ROC will be preferably selected from the group of the thenoyl, furoyl, and nìcotinoyl radicals. RC r • 15111i!i ii: .W. • i i i!ii!iiii » .i lO 3o A RC 53634:3 While these compounds may be prepared by any desired method, a preferable method is by the reaction of a kno»rn diaminodiphenyldisulfide with a known chloroforraute of the R-OH type alcohols. By way of example, a list of typical esters will include methyl, ethyl allyle propylée butyl, amyl, hexyl, phenyl, benzyl toll, xylyl, diphenyl and naphthyl chloroformate. Reaction may be carrìed out simply by adding the ester to a solution of "the diaminodisulfide in a suitable solvent such as pyridine. ç en addition is complete, and the mixture is at about room temperature, it is dro»med in water° The product separates out, generally, but not necessarily, as an oll which soon solidifies or crystallizes. This product is then collected and purified either by distillation or crystallization. While there appears to be no predictable basis for the activity possessed by these compounds as a class, the desired peptizing properties appear to be most noticeable in the type wherein the (-NHCO-R) substituent is in the ortho-position. Particularly active compounds appear to be those wherein ROC is a heterocyclic radical selected from the group of the thenoyl, furoyl, and nicotìnoyl radicals. These novel compounds have the desired plasticizing effect on both natural and synthetic rubbers without being subject to the characteristic objectionable odor of those materials previously used They appear to be particularly free from objection as producing dermatites conditions. Oddly enough, the plasticizing action appears to be quite specific to the particular molecular structure° Particularly is this true of the location of the carboxyamino group. In the ortho position it is a much better plasticizer than in the para position. While the para position materials may be used, as was noted above, the o,o'-derivatives are to be preferred. GO 3571 PTD. IN U.S.A, LL -- 53 634 3 An advantage of the materials of the present invention is that only small amounts are required. Generally, this will constitute from about 0.025% by weight of the hydrocarbon, which is an effective amount with many natura! rubbers, up fo about 5%, iqich may be required for particularly stubborn copolymers such as some of those of butadiene-l,3 and acrylonitrile. he range required for a particular polymer or copolymer will vary somewhat with the nature of the material as has been sho»m. For example, with natural rubber, amounts as littleI as 0.025% are useíkul although up to about 1.0% may be required. 1 Generally, the range of from 0.125 to 0.5% by weight will be preferred1 for the average natural rubber. By way of contrast, a copolymer such as that of butadiene-l,3 and styrene may require about 0.5 to 3.0%, depending upon the proportions in the copolymer and the compounding materials which may have been added or may be subsequently added. Butadiene-l,3 and acrylonitrile copolymers may require even more, in the range of from 0.5 to 5%. It is a further advantage of the present invention that it is applicable to all vulcanizable polymers plasticizable by oxidation. This will include the natural and many synthetic rubber-like : materìals. For example, natural rubbers, such as Hevea Braziliensis and simìlsr types and guayule may be readily treated and softened. Synthetic, rubber-like, polymers of butadiene-l,3 and copol ners of a butadiene-l,3 with other polymerizable compounds are also readily plasticized by incorporating therein the di(carbalkoxyamino)-diphenyldisulfides of the present invention. Examples of synthetic rubberllke polymers of a butadiene-l,3 include those of butadiene-l,3; methy - 2-butadiene-1,3 (isoprene) ; chlòro-2-butadiene-l,3 (chloroprene) ; piperylene and 2,3-dimethylbutadiene-l,3. Illustrative copolymers include those of a butadiene-l,3 with polymerizable compounds which contain en olefinic group (-CHa = CH-) wherein at least one of the disconnected valences is attached to a group which increases the polar character of the moleoe1 le Examples of such compounds include aryl !i!i:i(¸ i::ï iii!!: j, • ii? ¸ .c< i"i}:Zl¸, '-!ff i i;I :I I ; I/¸ !:I( :I • I q6•• 2o GOF 3571 PTD.

The expression "a rubber" as used herein refers to such natural and artificial rubbers. Temperatures required for carrying out the plasticizing operation usually run somewhat above about lOO«-llS°C., using the recommended amounts of plasticizer in nattoeal rubbers. There are some cases where slightly higher temperatures are necessary. With some rubbers as high as about 165°C. may be required. Plasticizing is readily carried out with standard equipment, such as open mills, Gordon plasticators, Banbury-type mixers of conventional design or any other suitable milling equipment. It is also possible to mill the plasticizer into the rubber at temperatures below those at which the plasticizer is active during milling. For example, the plasticizer may be incorporated into the compositions by milling at temperatures below lO0°C, until it is fairly uniformly dispersed or disseminated therein. Subsequently, a short period of heating, as for example in an oven at about 100°-165°C. will affect plas ti ci nation. In general, the plasticizing of the rubber or synthetic rubber should be carried out before the compounding into a vulcanizable i mixture is done. any of the commonly-used fillers, reinforcing agents, pigments and the like, i.e., carbon black, suliktr, etc., have an inhibiting effect on the plasticizing action.

Plasticity of a compositìon is not easily defined. It may be conveniently measured by the use of the Williams Plastometer described in the "Industrial Engineering Chemistry" Vol. 16 (1924) pp. 362. The Williams "Y" value is the thickness of a 2 ce. pellet after a definite time in the plastometer at a stated temperature. This value is a measurement of the plasticity, the lower the value the more plastic the composition. After removing the pellet from the plastometer, its thickness is usually measured again after a definite time, for example, 1 minute. The difference between the "Y, value and the recoverèd thickness elves a measure of the recovery of the plasticized composition and provides another means of comparing the action of various chemicals on rubber. Another measure which has come to be a commercially accepted standard indication is known as the "Mooney" value. OEhe inventìon will be described in conjunction with the follo ±ng examples which are meant to be illustrative only and no'h by way of limitation. Where the "Y" value is indicated in the following examples it has the meaning described thereto in the above identified publication. All parts are by weight unless otherwise noted.

It is then heated for about 1/2 hour on a steam bath and the excess solvent is removed under reduced pressure.
