TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compounds, processes for their preparation, compositions containing them, to their use in the treatment of various disorders in particular allergic diseases and other inflammatory conditions for example allergic rhinitis and asthma, infectious diseases, and cancer, and as vaccine adjuvants. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Vertebrates are constantly threatened by the invasion of microorganisms and have evolved mechanisms of immune defence to eliminate infective pathogens. In mammals, this immune system comprises two branches; innate immunity and acquired immunity. The first line of host defence is the innate immune system, which is mediated by macrophages and dendritic cells. Acquired immunity involves the elimination of pathogens at the late stages of infection and also enables the generation of immunological memory. Acquired immunity is highly specific, due to the vast repertoire of lymphocytes with antigen-specific receptors that have undergone gene rearrangement. Central to the generation of an effective innate immune response in mammals are mechanisms which bring about the induction of interferons and other cytokines which act upon cells to induce a number of effects. In man, the type I interferons are a family of related proteins encoded by genes on chromosome 9 and encoding at least 13 isoforms of interferon alpha (IFNα) and one isoform of interferon beta (IFNβ). Interferon was first described as a substance which could protect cells from viral infection (Isaacs & Lindemann, J. Virus Interference. Proc. R. Soc. Lon. Ser. B. Biol. Sci. 1957: 147, 258-267). Recombinant IFNα was the first approved biological therapeutic and has become an important therapy in viral infections and in cancer. As well as direct antiviral activity on cells, interferons are known to be potent modulators of the immune response, acting on cells of the immune system (Gonzalez-Navajas J. M. et al Nature Reviews Immunology, 2012; 2, 125-35). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of ten Pattern Recognition Receptors described in man (Gay, N. J. et al, Annu. Rev. Biochem., 2007: 46, 141-165). TLRs are expressed predominantly by innate immune cells where their rôle is to monitor the environment for signs of infection and, on activation, mobilise defence mechanisms aimed at the elimination of invading pathogens. The early innate immune-responses triggered by TLRs limit the spread of infection, while the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that they induce lead to recruitment and activation of antigen presenting cells, B cells, and T cells. The TLRs can modulate the nature of the adaptive immune-responses to give appropriate protection via dendritic cell-activation and cytokine release (Akira S. et al, Nat. Immunol., 2001: 2, 675-680). The profile of the response seen from different TLR agonists depends on the cell type activated. TLR7 is a member of the subgroup of TLRs (TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9), localised in the endosomal compartment of cells which have become specialised to detect non-self nucleic acids. TLR7 plays a key rôle in anti-viral defence via the recognition of ssRNA (Diebold S. S. et al, Science, 2004: 303, 1529-1531; and Lund J. M. et al, PNAS, 2004: 101, 5598-5603). TLR7 has a restricted expression-profile in man and is expressed predominantly by B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), and to a lesser extent by monocytes. Plasmacytoid DCs are a unique population of lymphoid-derived dendritic cells (0.2-0.8% of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs)) which are the primary type I interferon-producing cells secreting high levels of interferon-alpha (IFNα) and interferon-beta (IFNβ) in response to viral infections (Liu Y-J, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 2005: 23, 275-306). Administration of a small molecule compound which could stimulate the innate immune response, including the activation of type I interferons and other cytokines via Toll-like receptors, could become an important strategy for the treatment or prevention of human diseases. Small molecule agonists of TLR7 have been described which can induce interferon alpha in animals and in man (Takeda K et al, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 2003: 21, 335-76). TLR7 agonists include imidazoquinoline compounds such as imiquimod and resiquimod, oxoadenine analogues and also nucleoside analogues such as loxoribine and 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine which have long been known to induce interferon alpha (Czarniecki. M., J. Med, Chem., 2008: 51, 6621-6626; Hedayat M. et al, Medicinal Research Reviews, 2012: 32, 294-325). This type of immunomodulatory strategy has the potential to identify compounds which may be useful in the treatment of allergic diseases (Moisan J. et al, Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol., 2006: 290, L987-995), viral infections (Horcroft N. J. et al, J. Antimicrob. Chemther, 2012: 67, 789-801), cancer (Krieg A., Curr. Oncol. Rep., 2004: 6(2), 88-95), other inflammatory conditions such as irritable bowel disease (Rakoff-Nahoum S., Cell., 2004, 23, 118(2): 229-41), and as vaccine adjuvants (Persing et al. Trends Microbiol. 2002: 10(10 Suppl), 532-7). More specifically, allergic diseases are associated with a Th2-biased immune-response to allergens. Th2 responses are associated with raised levels of IgE, which, via its effects on mast cells, promotes a hypersensitivity to allergens, resulting in the symptoms seen, for example, in asthma and allergic rhinitis. In healthy individuals the immune-response to allergens is more balanced with a mixed Th2/Th1 and regulatory T cell response. TLR7 ligands have been shown to reduce Th2 cytokine and enhance Th1 cytokine release in vitro and to ameliorate Th2-type inflammatory responses in allergic lung models in vivo (Duechs M. J., Pulmonary Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 2011: 24, 203-214; Fili L. et al, J. All. Clin. Immunol., 2006: 118, 511-517; Tao et al, Chin. Med. J., 2006: 119, 640-648; Van L. P. Eur. J. Immunol., 2011: 41, 1992-1999). Thus TLR7 ligands have the potential to rebalance the immune-response seen in allergic individuals and lead to disease modification. Recent clinical studies with the TLR7 agonist have shown repeated intranasal stimulation of TLR7 to produce a sustained reduction in the responsiveness to allergen in patients with both allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma (Greiff L. Respiratory Research, 2012: 13, 53; Leaker B. R. et al, Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., 2012: 185, A4184). In the search for novel small molecule inducers of human interferon IFNα an assay strategy has been developed to characterise small molecule (regardless of mechanism) which is based on stimulation of primary human donor cells or whole blood with compounds, and is disclosed herein.

Certain compounds of the invention have been shown to be inducers of human interferon and may possess a desirable developability profile compared to known inducers of human interferon. In addition, certain compounds of the invention may also show selectivity for IFNα with respect to TNFα. Compounds which induce human interferon may be useful in the treatment of various disorders, for example the treatment of allergic diseases and other inflammatory conditions, for example allergic rhinitis and asthma, the treatment of infectious diseases and cancer.

Consequently, the present invention is further directed to a vaccine composition comprising a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and an antigen or antigen composition. Certain compounds of the invention are potent immunomodulators and accordingly, care should be exercised in their handling. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In a first aspect, the present invention is directed to compounds of formula (I) and salts thereof: wherein: R1 is n-C3-6alkyl; R2 is hydrogen or methyl; R3 is hydrogen or C1-6alkyl; m is an integer having a value of 0 to 3. In a further aspect, R1 is n-butyl. In a further aspect, R2 is hydrogen. In a further aspect, m is an integer having a value of 0 or 1. In a further aspect, R3 is isopropyl. Examples of compounds of formula (I) are provided in the following group, and form a further aspect of the invention: 2-butyl-7-(3-(piperidin-4-yl)propyl)-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-amine;2-butyl-7-(3-(1-isopropylpiperidin-4-yl)propyl)-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-amine; and2-butyl-7-(2-(piperidin-4-yl)ethyl)-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-amine; and salts thereof. As used herein, the term “alkyl” refers to a saturated, hydrocarbon chain having the specified number of member atoms. Unless otherwise stated, the term ‘alkyl’ includes straight and branched alkyl groups. For example, C1-6alkyl refers to a saturated, straight or branched hydrocarbon chain having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as ethyl and isopropyl, and n-C3-6alkyl refers to a saturated, straight hydrocarbon chain having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, such as n-propyl, and n-butyl. It is to be understood that references herein to compounds of the invention mean a compound of formula (I) as the free base, or as a salt, for example a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. In one aspect of the invention, a compound of formula (I) is in the form of a free base. Salts of the compounds of formula (I) include pharmaceutically acceptable salts and salts which may not be pharmaceutically acceptable but may be useful in the preparation of compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In one aspect of the invention, a compound of formula (I) is in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Salts may be derived from certain inorganic or organic acids. Examples of salts are pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include acid addition salts. For a review on suitable salts see Berge et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 66:1-19 (1977). Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of a compound of formula (I) include inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, orthophosphoric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, or sulphuric acid, or with organic acids such as, for example, methanesulphonic acid, ethanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, salicylic acid, maleic acid, glycerophosphoric acid, tartaric, benzoic, glutamic, aspartic, benzenesulphonic, naphthalenesulphonic such as 2-naphthalenesuphonic, hexanoic acid or acetylsalicylic acid. The invention includes within its scope all possible stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric forms of the salts of the compounds of formula (I). For example, a dimaleate or hemi-succinate salt of the compound of formula (I). Salts may be formed using techniques well-known in the art, for example by precipitation from solution followed by filtration, or by evaporation of the solvent. Typically, a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt can be formed by reaction of a compound of formula (I) with a suitable acid (such as hydrobromic, hydrochloric, sulphuric, maleic, p-toluenesulphonic, methanesulphonic, naphthalenesulphonic or succinic acids), optionally in a suitable solvent such as an organic solvent, to give the salt which is usually isolated for example by crystallisation and filtration. It will be appreciated that many organic compounds can form complexes with solvents in which they are reacted or from which they are precipitated or crystallised. These complexes are known as “solvates”. For example, a complex with water is known as a “hydrate”. Solvents with high boiling points and/or solvents with a high propensity to form hydrogen bonds such as water, ethanol, iso-propyl alcohol, and N-methyl pyrrolidinone may be used to form solvates. Methods for the identification of solvated include, but are not limited to, NMR and microanalysis. Solvates of the compounds of formula (I) are within the scope of the invention. As used herein, the term solvate encompasses solvates of both a free base compound as well as any salt thereof. Certain of the compounds of the invention may contain chiral atoms and/or multiple bonds, and hence may exist in one or more stereoisomeric forms. The present invention encompasses all of the stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention, including optical isomers, whether as individual stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof including racemic modifications. Any stereoisomer may contain less than 10% by weight, for example less than 5% by weight, or less than 0.5% by weight, of any other stereoisomer. For example, any optical isomer may contain less than 10% by weight, for example less than 5% by weight, or less than 0.5% by weight, of its antipode. Certain of the compounds of the invention may exist in tautomeric forms. It will be understood that the present invention encompasses all of the tautomers of the compounds of the invention whether as individual tautomers or as mixtures thereof. The compounds of the invention may be in crystalline or amorphous form. Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms of the compounds of the invention may exist as polymorphs, all of which are included within the scope of the present invention. The most thermodynamically stable polymorphic form or forms of the compounds of the invention are of particular interest. Polymorphic forms of compounds of the invention may be characterised and differentiated using a number of conventional analytical techniques, including, but not limited to, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), infrared spectroscopy (IR), Raman spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR). The present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An isotopic variation of a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine and chlorine such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 17O, 18O, 18F and 36Cl, respectively. Certain isotopic variations of a compound of formula (I) or a salt or solvate thereof, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as 3H or 14C is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopic variations of a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically salt thereof, can generally be prepared by conventional procedures such as by the illustrative methods or by the preparations described in the Examples hereafter using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents. It will be appreciated from the foregoing that included within the scope of the invention are solvates, hydrates, isomers and polymorphic forms of the compounds of formula (I) and salts and solvates thereof.

Compositions for administration to the lung or nose may contain one or more excipients, for example one or more suspending agents, one or more preservatives, one or more surfactants, one or more tonicity adjusting agents, one or more co-solvents, and may include components to control the pH of the composition, for example a buffer system. Further, the compositions may contain other excipients such as antioxidants, for example sodium metabisulphite, and taste-masking agents. Compositions may also be administered to the nose or other regions of the respiratory tract by nebulisation. Intranasal compositions may permit the compound(s) of formula (I) or (a) pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s) thereof to be delivered to all areas of the nasal cavities (the target tissue) and further, may permit the compound(s) of formula (I) or (a) pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s) thereof to remain in contact with the target tissue for longer periods of time. A suitable dosing regime for intranasal compositions would be for the patient to inhale slowly through the nose subsequent to the nasal cavity being cleared. During inhalation the composition would be administered to one nostril while the other is manually compressed. This procedure would then be repeated for the other nostril. Typically, one or two sprays per nostril would be administered by the above procedure one, two, or three times each day, ideally once daily. Of particular interest are intranasal compositions suitable for once-daily administration. The suspending agent(s), if included, will typically be present in an amount of from 0.1 to 5% (w/w), such as from 1.5% to 2.4% (w/w), based on the total weight of the composition. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agents include, but are not limited to, Avicel® (microcrystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose sodium), carboxymethylcellulose sodium, veegum, tragacanth, bentonite, methylcellulose, xanthan gum, carbopol and polyethylene glycols. Compositions for administration to the lung or nose may contain one or more excipients may be protected from microbial or fungal contamination and growth by inclusion of one or more preservatives. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable anti-microbial agents or preservatives include, but are not limited to, quaternary ammonium compounds (for example benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, cetrimide, cetylpyridinium chloride, lauralkonium chloride and myristyl picolinium chloride), mercurial agents (for example phenylmercuric nitrate, phenylmercuric acetate and thimerosal), alcoholic agents (for example chlorobutanol, phenylethyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol), antibacterial esters (for example esters of para-hydroxybenzoic acid), chelating agents such as disodium edetate (EDTA) and other anti-microbial agents such as chlorhexidine, chlorocresol, sorbic acid and its salts (such as potassium sorbate) and polymyxin. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable anti-fungal agents or preservatives include, but are not limited to, sodium benzoate, sorbic acid, sodium propionate, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben and butylparaben. The preservative(s), if included, may be present in an amount of from 0.001 to 1% (w/w), such as from 0.015% to 0.5% (w/w) based on the total weight of the composition. Compositions (for example wherein at least one compound is in suspension) may include one or more surfactants which functions to facilitate dissolution of the medicament particles in the aqueous phase of the composition. For example, the amount of surfactant used is an amount which will not cause foaming during mixing. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable surfactants include fatty alcohols, esters and ethers, such as polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate (Polysorbate 80), macrogol ethers, and poloxamers. The surfactant may be present in an amount of between about 0.01 to 10% (w/w), such as from 0.01 to 0.75% (w/w), for example about 0.5% (w/w), based on the total weight of the composition. One or more tonicity-adjusting agent(s) may be included to achieve tonicity with body fluids e.g. fluids of the nasal cavity, resulting in reduced levels of irritancy. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable tonicity-adjusting agents include, but are not limited to, sodium chloride, dextrose, xylitol, calcium chloride, glucose, glycerine and sorbitol. A tonicity-adjusting agent, if present, may be included in an amount of from 0.1 to 10% (w/w), such as from 4.5 to 5.5% (w/w), for example about 5.0% (w/w), based on the total weight of the composition. The compositions of the invention may be buffered by the addition of suitable buffering agents such as sodium citrate, citric acid, trometamol, phosphates such as disodium phosphate (for example the dodecahydrate, heptahydrate, dihydrate and anhydrous forms), or sodium phosphate and mixtures thereof. A buffering agent, if present, may be included in an amount of from 0.1 to 5% (w/w), for example 1 to 3% (w/w) based on the total weight of the composition. Examples of taste-masking agents include sucralose, sucrose, saccharin or a salt thereof, fructose, dextrose, glycerol, corn syrup, aspartame, acesulfame-K, xylitol, sorbitol, erythritol, ammonium glycyrrhizinate, thaumatin, neotame, mannitol, menthol, eucalyptus oil, camphor, a natural flavouring agent, an artificial flavouring agent, and combinations thereof. One or more co-solvent(s) may be included to aid solubility of the medicament compound(s) and/or other excipients. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable co-solvents include, but are not limited to, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, ethanol, polyethylene glycols (for example PEG300 or PEG400), and methanol. In one embodiment, the co-solvent is propylene glycol. Co-solvent(s), if present, may be included in an amount of from 0.05 to 30% (w/w), such as from 1 to 25% (w/w), for example from 1 to 10% (w/w) based on the total weight of the composition. Compositions for inhaled administration include aqueous, organic or aqueous/organic mixtures, dry powder or crystalline compositions administered to the respiratory tract by pressurised pump or inhaler, for example, reservoir dry powder inhalers, unit-dose dry powder inhalers, pre-metered multi-dose dry powder inhalers, nasal inhalers or pressurised aerosol inhalers, nebulisers or insufflators. Suitable compositions contain water as the diluent or carrier for this purpose and may be provided with conventional excipients such as buffering agents, tonicity modifying agents and the like. Aqueous compositions may also be administered to the nose and other regions of the respiratory tract by nebulisation. Such compositions may be aqueous solutions or suspensions or aerosols delivered from pressurised packs, such as a metered dose inhaler, with the use of a suitable liquefied propellant. Compositions for administration topically to the nose (for example, for the treatment of rhinitis) or to the lung, include pressurised aerosol compositions and aqueous compositions delivered to the nasal cavities by pressurised pump. Compositions which are non-pressurised and are suitable for administration topically to the nasal cavity are of particular interest. Suitable compositions contain water as the diluent or carrier for this purpose. Aqueous compositions for administration to the lung or nose may be provided with conventional excipients such as buffering agents, tonicity-modifying agents and the like. Aqueous compositions may also be administered to the nose by nebulisation. A fluid dispenser may typically be used to deliver a fluid composition to the nasal cavities. The fluid composition may be aqueous or non-aqueous, but typically aqueous. The compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may be formulated as a suspension or solution. Such a fluid dispenser may have a dispensing nozzle or dispensing orifice through which a metered dose of the fluid composition is dispensed upon the application of a user-applied force to a pump mechanism of the fluid dispenser. Such fluid dispensers are generally provided with a reservoir of multiple metered doses of the fluid composition, the doses being dispensable upon sequential pump actuations. Alternatively, the fluid dispenser for delivery of a fluid composition to the nasal cavities may be designed to be dose-limited, for example a single use dispenser comprising a single dose. The dispensing nozzle or orifice may be configured for insertion into the nostrils of the user for spray dispensing of the fluid composition into the nasal cavity. A fluid dispenser of the aforementioned type is described and illustrated in International Patent Application publication number WO 2005/044354 (Glaxo Group Limited). The dispenser has a housing which houses a fluid-discharge device having a compression pump mounted on a container for containing a fluid composition. The housing has at least one finger-operable side lever which is movable inwardly with respect to the housing to move the container upwardly in the housing by means of a cam to cause the pump to compress and pump a metered dose of the composition out of a pump stem through a nasal nozzle of the housing. In one embodiment, the fluid dispenser is of the general type illustrated in FIGS. 30-40 of WO 2005/044354. Aqueous compositions containing a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may also be delivered by a pump as disclosed in International Patent Application publication number WO2007/138084 (Glaxo Group Limited), for example as disclosed with reference to FIGS. 22-46 thereof, or as disclosed in United Kingdom patent application number GB0723418.0 (Glaxo Group Limited), for example as disclosed with reference to FIGS. 7-32 thereof. The pump may be actuated by an actuator as disclosed in FIGS. 1-6 of GB0723418.0. Dry powder compositions for topical delivery to the lung by inhalation may, for example, be presented in capsules and cartridges of for example gelatine, or blisters of for example laminated aluminium foil, for use in an inhaler or insufflator. Powder blend compositions generally contain a powder mix for inhalation of the compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a suitable powder base (carrier/diluent/excipient substance) such as mono-, di-, or polysaccharides (for example lactose or starch). Dry powder compositions may also include, in addition to the drug and carrier, a further excipient (for example a ternary agent such as a sugar ester for example cellobiose octaacetate, calcium stearate, or magnesium stearate. In one embodiment, a composition suitable for inhaled administration may be incorporated into a plurality of sealed dose containers provided on medicament pack(s) mounted inside a suitable inhalation device. The containers may be rupturable, peelable, or otherwise openable one-at-a-time and the doses of the dry powder composition administered by inhalation on a mouthpiece of the inhalation device, as known in the art. The medicament pack may take a number of different forms, for instance a disk-shape or an elongate strip. Representative inhalation devices are the DISKHALER™ and DISKUS™ devices, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline. A dry powder inhalable composition may also be provided as a bulk reservoir in an inhalation device, the device then being provided with a metering mechanism for metering a dose of the composition from the reservoir to an inhalation channel where the metered dose is able to be inhaled by a patient inhaling at a mouthpiece of the device. Exemplary marketed devices of this type are TURBUHALER™ (AstraZeneca), TWISTHALER™ (Schering) and CLICKHALER™ (Innovata.) A further delivery method for a dry powder inhalable composition is for metered doses of the composition to be provided in capsules (one dose per capsule) which are then loaded into an inhalation device, typically by the patient on demand. The device has means to rupture, pierce or otherwise open the capsule so that the dose is able to be entrained into the patient's lung when they inhale at the device mouthpiece. As marketed examples of such devices there may be mentioned ROTAHALER™ (GlaxoSmithKline) and HANDIHALER™ (Boehringer Ingelheim.) Pressurised aerosol compositions suitable for inhalation can be either a suspension or a solution and may contain a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a suitable propellant such as a fluorocarbon or hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon or mixtures thereof, particularly hydrofluoroalkanes, especially 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane or a mixture thereof. The aerosol composition may optionally contain additional composition excipients well known in the art such as surfactants e.g. oleic acid, lecithin or an oligolactic acid or derivative thereof e.g. as described in WO 94/21229 and WO 98/34596 (Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company) and co-solvents e.g. ethanol. Pressurised compositions will generally be retained in a canister (e.g. an aluminium canister) closed with a valve (e.g. a metering valve) and fitted into an actuator provided with a mouthpiece. Ointments, creams and gels, may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agent and/or solvents. Such bases may thus, for example, include water and/or an oil such as liquid paraffin or a vegetable oil such as arachis oil or castor oil, or a solvent such as polyethylene glycol. Thickening agents and gelling agents which may be used according to the nature of the base include soft paraffin, aluminium stearate, cetostearyl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, wool-fat, beeswax, ca rboxypolymethylene and cellulose derivatives, and/or glyceryl monostearate and/or non-ionic emulsifying agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents or thickening agents. Powders for external application may be formed with the aid of any suitable powder base, for example, talc, lactose or starch. Drops may be formulated with an aqueous or non-aqueous base also comprising one or more dispersing agents, solubilising agents, suspending agents or preservatives. The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may, for example, be formulated for transdermal delivery by composition into patches or other devices (e.g. pressurised gas devices) which deliver the active component into the skin. For buccal administration the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in the conventional manner. The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may also be formulated as suppositories, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may also be formulated for parenteral administration by bolus injection or continuous infusion and may be presented in unit dose form, for instance as ampoules, vials, small volume infusions or pre-filled syringes, or in multidose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as solutions, suspensions, or emulsions in aqueous or non-aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as antioxidants, buffers, antimicrobial agents and/or tonicity adjusting agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use. The dry solid presentation may be prepared by filling a sterile powder aseptically into individual sterile containers or by filling a sterile solution aseptically into each container and freeze-drying. The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may also be formulated with vaccines as adjuvants to modulate their activity. Such compositions may contain antibody(ies) or antibody fragment(s) or an antigenic component including but not limited to protein, DNA, live or dead bacteria and/or viruses or virus-like particles, together with one or more components with adjuvant activity including but not limited to aluminium salts, oil and water emulsions, heat shock proteins, lipid A preparations and derivatives, glycolipids, other TLR agonists such as CpG DNA or similar agents, cytokines such as GM-CSF or IL-12 or similar agents. In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a vaccine adjuvant comprising a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. There is further provided a vaccine composition comprising a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and an antigen or antigen composition.

The invention provides in a further aspect, a combination comprising a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with at least one other therapeutically-active agent. The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and the other therapeutically-active agent(s) may be administered together or separately and, when administered separately, administration may occur simultaneously or sequentially, in any order. The amounts of the compound(s) of formula (I) or (a) pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s) thereof and the other therapeutically-active agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect. The administration of a combination of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with other treatment agents may be by administration concomitantly in a unitary pharmaceutical composition including both compounds, or in separate pharmaceutical compositions each including one of the compounds. Alternatively, the combination may be administered separately in a sequential manner wherein one treatment agent is administered first and the other second or vice versa. Such sequential administration may be close in time or remote in time. The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be used in combination with one or more agents useful in the prevention or treatment of viral infections.

The invention includes in a further aspect a combination comprising a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with at least one other therapeutically active agent. The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for use in the form of a pharmaceutical composition and thus pharmaceutical compositions comprising a combination as defined above together with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier thereof represent a further aspect of the invention. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof will depend upon a number of factors. For example, the species, age, and weight of the recipient, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, the nature of the composition, and the route of administration are all factors to be considered. The therapeutically effective amount ultimately should be at the discretion of the attendant physician. Regardless, an effective amount of a compound of the present invention for the treatment of humans suffering from frailty, generally, should be in the range of 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg body weight of recipient per day. More usually the effective amount should be in the range of 0.001 to 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Thus, for a 70 kg adult one example of an actual amount per day would usually be from 7 to 700 mg. For intranasal and inhaled routes of administration, typical doses for a 70 kg adult should be in the range of 0.1 micrograms to 1 mg per day, for example 1 μg, 10 μg or 100 μg. This amount may be given in a single dose per day or in a number (such as two, three, four, five, or more) of sub-doses per day such that the total daily dose is the same. An effective amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula (I) may be determined as a proportion of the effective amount of the compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof per se. Similar dosages should be appropriate for treatment of the other conditions referred to herein. Compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may also be administered at any appropriate frequency e.g. 1-7 times per week. The precise dosing regimen will of course depend on factors such as the therapeutic indication, the age and condition of the patient, and the particular route of administration chosen. In one aspect of the invention, a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may be administered once weekly for a period of 4 to 8 weeks, for example 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 weeks. Pharmaceutical compositions may be presented in unit-dose forms containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. Such a unit may contain, as a non-limiting example, 0.5 mg to 1 g of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration, and the age, weight, and condition of the patient. Preferred unit-dosage compositions are those containing a daily dose or sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared by any of the methods well-known in the pharmacy art. There is also provided a process for preparing such a pharmaceutical composition which comprises admixing a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Aspects of the invention are illustrated by reference to, but are in no way limited by, the following Examples.

LCMS (System B): tRET=0.75 min; MH+ 302 Biological Evaluation Compounds of the invention were tested for in vitro biological activity in accordance with the following assay. Assay for the Induction of Interferon-α and TNF-α Using Fresh Human Whole Blood (WB) Compound Preparation Compounds were prepared at 100× required concentration in DMSO in flat-bottom microtitre plates at a volume of 1.5 μL. Columns 1-10 contained a 1 in 4 serial dilution of the test compound. Included on each plate was a serial dilution of the TLR7/8 agonist resiquimod as a standard and Column 11 contained 1.5 μl of 200 μM resiquimod (giving a 2 μM final concentration, used to define the approximate maximal response to resiquimod). Each compound was assayed in duplicate for each donor. Incubation and Assays for Interferon-α and TNF-α Blood samples from three human donors were collected into sodium heparin (10 U/ml). 150 μl of whole Blood was dispensed into Col 1 to 11 of assay plates containing 1.5 μl of test compound or standard in DMSO. Plates were placed in an incubator overnight (37° C., 95% air, 5% CO2). Following the overnight incubation, plates were removed from the incubator & mixed on an orbital shaker for approximately 1 minute. 100 μl of 0.9% saline was added to each well and the plates mixed again on an orbital shaker. Plates were then centrifuged (2500 rpm, 10 mins), after which a sample of plasma was removed using a Biomek FX and assayed for both IFN-α and TNF-α using the MSD (Mesoscale Discovery) electrochemiluminescence assay platform. The IFN-α assay was carried out similarly to that described above. The TNF-α assay was carried out as per kit instructions (Cat No K111BHB). Cytokine released was expressed as a percentage of the 2 μM resiquimod control (column 11). This percentage was plotted against compound concentration and the pEC50 for the response determined by non-linear least squares curve fitting. For the IFN-α responses, generally a 4 parameter logistic model was selected. For the TNF-α responses where a clear maximum response was obtained (i.e. a well defined plateau in the response was observed) then a 4 parameter model was generally used. If the upper asymptote of the curve wasn't well defined then the curve fitting was generally constrained to a maximal response of 100% (i.e. to the response to 2 μM resiquimod) or to the response of the highest concentration tested if this was greater than the resiquimod response. Some curves were bell shaped for one or both cytokines and the cytokine data on the down slope of the bell shaped response (i.e. concentrations above those giving the maximal response) were generally excluded from the fit, usually with the exception of the concentration immediately above the peak response. Curve fitting thus concentrated on the up slope of the dose response curve. Results Examples 1 to 3 had a mean pEC50 for INF-α of ≧6.4. Examples 1 to 3 had a mean pEC50 for TNF-α of ≧5.0. 1.-24.
