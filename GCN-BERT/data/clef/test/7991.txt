Synthesis of compound 25-a
Compound 25-b (350mg, 0.89mmol) was dissolved in phosphorus oxychloride (8mL), stirred at 110□ for 5hrs. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, added to ice water (20mL), followed by adding sodium carbonate solid to adjust pH=8, and then extracted with EA (30mL×3). The organic phases were in turn washed with water (20mL) and saturated brine (20mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica column chromatography (PE:EA = 2:1) to give yellow oil 25-a (150mg, yield 45%).
