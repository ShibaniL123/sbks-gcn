Step 5
To Compound 145 (70 mg, 0.118 mmol) in ethanol (1 mL) and THF (1 mL) solution were added 2 mol/L aqueous sodium hydroxide (0.279 mL, 0.58 mmol), the mixture was stirred under reflux for 3.5 hours. 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (chloroform - methanol) to obtain Compound I-212 (40 mg, 59% yield) as a brown solid.
