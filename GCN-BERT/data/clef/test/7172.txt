PRIOR RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(a)-(d) of Chinese Patent Application Serial Number 200810107262.2, filed Oct. 9, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION Provided herein are, among other things, epoxy resin varnishes and methods of making and using the same. In some embodiments, the epoxy resin varnishes comprise at least a filler such as silica. In certain embodiments, the epoxy resin varnishes provided herein are used for making laminates such as copper clad laminates. The copper clad laminates provided herein can be used to make printed circuit boards (PCBs). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION After more than half a century of development of epoxy copper clad laminate (CCL), the worldwide annual output of epoxy CCL is more than 300 million square meters. Epoxy CCL has been widely used as a reinforcement material for making epoxy printed circuit board (PCB). Epoxy CCL can generally provide desirable properties such as turn-on interconnection, insulation and support for circuits. In general, the properties of epoxy CCL can affect the signal transmission speed, energy loss, impedance, and the like of the PCB. Therefore, the performance, quality, processability, the manufacturing level, manufacturing costs, as well as long-term reliability and stability of the epoxy printed circuit board depend to a large extent on the properties of the CCL material. Whether it is a lead-free CCL, high density interconnect (HDI) CCL, integrated circuit (IC) packaging reinforcements or high-performance flexible CCL, the CCL should have a good adhesive strength, excellent insulation properties, high heat resistance and humidity resistant. In some embodiments, inorganic filler are added to varnishes comprising epoxy resins to reduce costs and improve the performance of the epoxy CCL. Choice of which have a relatively large number of talcum powder, aluminum hydroxide, silica, mica, and so on, all the materials can be in the dimensional stability of the CCL, the direction of the thickness of the expansion coefficient (Z-CTE) to achieve significant results. When the peel strength is low, there is a possibility that circuit peeling during the manufacturing process of a printed circuit board and the falling-off of mounted parts in the outermost layer may occur and this is undesirable. Therefore, there is a need for metal clad laminates with improved peel strength. There is also a need for metal clad laminates with improved Z-CTE.

All reagents, unless otherwise indicated, were obtained commercially. The following examples are intended for illustrative purposes only and do not limit in any way the scope of the present invention. The general formulation of some of the epoxy resin varnishes disclosed herein is shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 Ingredients Supplier Amount Epoxy resin (solid) XU 19074 was obtained from the Dow Chemical 100 g Company, Midland, MI. Phenolic novolac KPH-L2003 was obtained from Kolon GP 15 g-35 g Chemical(SuZhou) Co., Ltd, Suzhou, China. Filler Any filler disclosed herein. 0 g-30 g Coupling agent Dow Corning Z-6040 silane was obtained from the 0.2 g-0.5 g Dow Corning Corporation, Midland, MI. Catalyst 2MZ (i.e., 2-methyl imidazole) was obtained from 0.05 g-0.1 g Shikoku OM (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. Solvent PM glycol ether was obtained from the Dow 10 g-30 g Chemical Company, Midland, MI. The general procedure of making a copper clad laminate is as follows. The first step of making the laminate is the preparation of the epoxy resin varnish. At about 35° C., the epoxy resin, curing agent, coupling agent, catalyst, solvent and inorganic filler were added into a container and the mixture was mixed to form the epoxy resin varnish. The second step of making the copper clad laminate was impregnation. A glass cloth was impregnated and heated in an oven temperature at about 150° C. to about 250° C. until it has become a prepreg. The line speed of the prepreg making machine for making the prepreg was from about 6 m/minute to about 12 m/minute. The gel time was from about 60 minutes to about 90 minutes. The resin content was from about 40% to about 80%. The resin flow was from about 20% to about 50%. The volatile content was lower than about 0.75%. The third step of making the copper clad laminate was hot pressing. After the prepreg was cut into the required size, the prepreg was laminated with a copper foil. Hot pressing was performed on the laminate to form a copper clad laminate. The conditions of the hot pressing step were set at a vacuum of 40 torr at a press pressure from about 20 kg/cm2 to about 35 kg/cm2. The hot press was set at a temperature from about 50° C. to about 240° C. and the temperature ramping rate was from about 1.0° C./minute to about 3.0° C./minute. The curing time was from about 45 minutes to about 90 minutes and the press time was from about 120 minutes to about 240 minutes. Testing Procedures of Copper Clad Laminates Peel Strength The peel strength of the copper clad laminates prepared herein was measured according to IPC-TM-650 2.4.8. Apparatus and chemicals required for the peel strength test include a tensile tester equipped with a load cell, capable of measuring to the nearest 0.0045 kg, a solder pot, a specimen hold-down clamping system, organic chemical stripper (e.g., methylene chloride), sodium hydroxide 10 g/liter, boric acid 30 g/liter, sulfuric acid 10 g/liter, organic degreaser (e.g., isopropyl alcohol), hot fluid bath, Dow Silicone Fluid no. 704 and Dow Silicone Grease. Specimens of the copper clad laminates were cut into 3.18 mm test strips. A minimum of two test strips per specimen were peeled. For testing peel strength of materials as received, the specimen was fasten down and an unencumbered vertical pull was exerted. Force was applied in the vertical direction at the rate of about 50.8 mm/minute until at least a 25.4 mm peel was completed. For testing peel strength after thermal stress, a thin coating of silicon grease was applied to the specimen and float on solder pot maintained at about 288° C. for about 10 seconds. Evaluation of the specimen was performed by normal or corrected 20/20 vision to record loss of surface resin, discoloration, resin softening, delamination, blistering, propagation of imperfections, measling, crazing, or voids. The peel strength was calculated as per the formula: peel strength (in lbs/in)=LM/WS, where LM was the minimum load and WS was measured width of the peel strip. Thermal Decomposition The thermal decomposition of the copper clad laminates prepared herein was measured according to IPC-TM-650 2.4.24.6. The thermogravimetry analyzer (TGA) was equipped with a null type microbalance, sensitive to 0.001 mg, a furnace equipped with dry nitrogen purge and a temperature programmer capable of providing controlled about 10° C. per minute heating rate from ambient to about 550° C. The gas purge was generally ran for 30 minutes before inserting a sample and the instrument was calibrated with the same flow rate as used during the test. During the test, a sample was weighed (from about 10 mg to about 30 mg) and placed in the TGA. The sample was heated at a rate of 10° C./minute from <50° C. to about 550° C. Td(2%) data were taken when the sample was 2.0% less than its mass measured at 50° C. Td(5%) data were taken when the sample was 5.0% less than its mass measured at 50° C. Tensile Strength, Elongation and Modulus The tensile strength, elongation and modulus of the copper clad laminates prepared herein were measured according to IPC-TM 650 2.4.18.3. The testing machine was equipped with a load cell and a device for recording tensile load. Gripping devices were used to avoid slippage and uneven stress distribution. The test specimen was a strip of about 12.70 mm wide by 76.20 mm long and about 10 μm in thickness. The test was conducted at about 23° C. and about 50% relative humidity. The test specimen was measured to an accuracy of 0.1 μm at about 5 different places within the gauge length area, and the initial gauge length was set at 25.4 mm and the rate of grip separation at 5.08 mm/minute. The mean and standard deviation for tensile strength, elongation and modulus in each specimen were calculated according to IPC-TM 650 2.4.18.3 and used to determine the final result. Volume and Surface Resistivities The volume and surface resistivities of the copper clad laminates prepared herein were measured according to IPC-TM-650 2.5.17.1. When the thickness of the laminate was 0.51 mm or greater, three specimens of dimensions about 101.6 mm×101.6 mm by the thickness were prepared for each test condition. When the thickness of the laminate was less than 0.51 mm, three specimens of dimensions about 50.8 mm×50.8 mm by the thickness were prepared for each test condition. All samples were photoprinted with a pattern of the outlines of the conductors and etched in accordance with IPC-TM-650 methods attached with electrodes. For laminates thicker than 0.51 mm, the electrodes were applied using silver conductive paint. Specimens of a thickness less than 0.51 mm were conditioned by subjecting to about 90% relative humidity and about 35° C. for a period of about 96 hours prior to electrical measurement. Specimens of a thickness greater than, or equal to, 0.51 mm were conditioned by subjecting to the conditioning specified in IPC-TM-650 2.6.3. For elevated temperature conditioning, specimens shall be subjected to about 125° C. for a period of about 24 hours. All electrical measurements were taken inside the applicable conditioning chamber completed within the 2 hour tolerance of the conditioning after achieving 1.5 hours steady state of about 25° C. and about 90% relative humidity. All electrical measurements were made using 500 volts direct current applied for about 60 seconds prior to taking the actual reading for stabilization purposes. The measurement of the volume resistance was by connecting the resistance measuring device to the specimen electrodes through the fixture system. The measurement of the surface resistance was by interchanging the test cables connecting the solid back electrode and the outer ring to the instrument for the arrangement shown in FIG. 3 of IPC-TM-650 2.5.17.1. The surface and volume resistivities were calculated according to IPC-TM-650 2.5.17.1. Water Absorption The water absorption of the copper clad laminates prepared herein was measured according to IPC-TM-650 2.6.2.1. Three test specimens were prepared to about 2.0 inches long by 2.0 inches wide by the thickness of the material with edges milled or sand smoothed with 400 grit. The metal cladding was removed by etching per IPC-TM-650, Methods 2.3.6, 2.3.7 or 2.3.7.1. The apparatus required was a circulating air oven capable of maintaining a uniform temperature of about 105° to 110° C. and a desiccator capable of maintaining less than 20% R.H. at about 21° C. The specimens were conditioned by the drying oven for 1 hour, cooled to room temperature in a desiccator and weighed immediately. The specimens were immersed in a container of distilled water maintained at about 23° C. for about 24 hours to 24 hours and 3 0 minutes. The specimens were then cloth dried and weighed immediately. The water absorption was the percentage increase in weight for each specimen calculated according to IPC-TM-650 2.6.2.1. Dielectric Constant and Dissipation Factor The dielectric constant and dissipation factor of the copper clad laminates prepared herein were according to IPC-TM-650 2.5.5.2. Each specimen was about 50.8 mm in diameter by thickness of laminate or reinforcement material. Both sides of the specimens were coated with one uniform coating of silver conductive paint. The specimens were air dried until dry to touch and oven-dried at about 50° C. and cool in a desiccator. A 25.4 mm diameter disc was punched or machined into the specimens which were conditioned for a minimum of 40 hours at about 23° C. at relative humidity of about 50%. The specimen was placed onto the meter and the dissipation factor was read on the display. The dielectric constant was calculated according to IPC-TM-650 2.5.5.2. Permittivity and Loss Tangent The permittivity and loss tangent of the copper clad laminates prepared herein were measured according to IPC-TM-650 2.5.5.3, which is incorporated herein by reference. Three specimens each about 50 mm×50 mm with 1.0 mm thickness were prepared. All samples were conditioned at about 23° C. and about 50% RH for a minimum of 24 hours prior to testing. For a sample that was newly etched or exposed to excessive moisture, it was dried in an air-circulating oven for two hours at about 105° C. prior to testing and conditioned at room temperature stated in the above. An impedance material analyzer with a calibration-verification kit was used. The instrument was calibrated 24 hours within the measurement. The unit was set to sweep the target frequency±0.5% of the target. Sample thickness was measured and the sample was placed into the machine, making good contact with the fixture electrons but not touching the back wall of the fixture. The test was ran and the average permittivity and loss tangent over the narrow frequency range sweep were recorded. Thermal Stress The thermal stress of the copper clad laminates prepared herein was measured according to IPC-TM-650 2.4.13.1. For each clad side and test condition, three specimens were used for qualification testing and two specimens for lot acceptance testing. Each specimens was about 50.8 mm×50.8 mm by the thickness of the laminate. Half of the metallic clad laminate sampling was completely etched in accordance with standard industry practices. The series of apparatus required to perform this test included an air circulating oven capable of maintaining a temperature of about 125° C., a thermostatically controlled electrically heated solder pot containing at least 1.0 kg of solder of about 288° C., a thermocouple or other device capable of measuring the solder temperature at a depth of 25.4 mm, a desiccation chamber capable of maintaining an atmosphere less than 30% RH at 23° C. and a series of optical magnification equipments. The sample was first conditioned in the air-circulating oven for 4 to 6 hours and placed in a desiccators and allowed to cool to room temperature, subsequently fluxed with rosin flux and drained in a vertical position. The specimen was then float for about 10 seconds on the surface of a solder bath maintained at specified temperatures. The specimens were kept in intimate contact with the solder surface and agitated by gentle downward pressure using tongs or equivalent. The specimens were then cooled to room temperature. Evidence of charring, surface contamination, loss of surface resin, resin softening, delamination, blistering, weave exposure, propagation of imperfection, measling, crazing, voids, blistering, delamination (e.g., bumps) or other damages were recorded. Flammability Test The flammability of the copper clad laminates prepared herein was measured according to UL 94. The UL94 is a test which determines the material's burning characteristics after test specimens have been exposed to a specified test flame under controlled laboratory conditions. Twelve flame classifications were used to categories results, 6 of which relate to materials commonly used in manufacturing enclosures, structural parts and insulators found in consumer electronic products (5VA, 5VB, V-0, V-1, V-2, HB); 3 of which relate to low-density from materials commonly used in fabricating speaker grills and sound-deadening material (HF-1, HF-2, HBF); the final 3 relate to very thin films, generally not capable of supporting themselves in a horizontal position, usually found in substrates on printed circuit boards (VTM-0, VTM-1, VTM-2). The test was conducted by placing test specimens molded from plastic materials orientated in either horizontal or vertical positions, and were subjected to a defined flame ignition source for a specified period of time. In a horizontal burning test, the result was the rate less than a specified maximum when the material was burned horizontally. In vertical burning, the result was the time taken for the material to self-extinguished after the ignition source was removed and the tendency of the specimen to ignite a cotton indicator located below the sample by dripping flaming particles.
