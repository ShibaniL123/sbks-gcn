No. 8,101,706 (issued Jan. 24, 12), which is a continuation in part of U.S. Pat. No. 8,110,651 (issued Feb. 7, 2012), which is the national stage of International Application No. PCT/US2009/030762 (filed Jan. 12, 2009, published), which claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 61/020,684 (filed Jan. 11, 2008, expired) and Provisional Application No. 61/029,337 (filed Feb. 16, 2008, expired). FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure relates to multifunctional copolymers of polyoxazolines, methods of synthesis and intermediate compounds useful in producing such polyoxazoline derivatives, and conjugates of these polyoxazolines with therapeutic, diagnostic and biological-targeting molecules produced using such polyoxazoline derivatives. BACKGROUND Polymer-modified therapeutics have proven to be of great utility in modern pharmaceutical science. Because of the success of polymer-modified therapeutics, it is of interest to expand the range of polymers suitable for such applications, especially to provide polymers having properties not possessed by polymers of the prior art. A need exists for water-soluble, non-toxic polymers which can be used to prepare desired conjugates with target molecules. A need also exists for such polymers with multiple functionalities for use in preparing desired conjugates with multiple molecules (such as, but not limited to, targeting moieties, therapeutic moieties and diagnostic moieties). Using such polymers with multiple functionalities would allow the production of conjugates containing one or more diagnostic and/or therapeutic moiety or conjugates containing a mixture of distinct diagnostic and/or targeting moieties. The present disclosure provides heterofunctional polyoxazoline compounds which provide ready coupling to a range of molecules, such as but not limited to, targeting, therapeutic and/or diagnostic moieties.

Thus the phrase includes straight chain alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl and the like. The phrase also includes branched chain isomers of straight chain alkyl groups, including but not limited to, the following which are provided by way of example; —CH(CH3)2, —CH(CH2)CH3)), —CH(CH2CH3)2, —C(CH3)3, —C(CH2CH3)3, —CH2CH(CH3)2, —CH2CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), —CH2CH(CH2CH3)2, —CH2C(CH3)3, —CH2C(CH2CH3)3, —CH(CH3)CH3)(CH2CH3), —CH2CH2CH(CH3)2, —CH2CH2(CH2CH3), —CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)2, —CH2CH2C(CH3)3, —CH2CH2C(CH2CH3)3, —CH(CH3)CH2CH(CH3)2, —CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH(CH3)2, —CH(CH2 CH3)CH(CH3)CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), and others.

As used herein, the term “alkyenyl”, whether used alone or as part of a substituent group, includes an alkyl group having at least one double bond between any two adjacent carbon atoms. As used herein, the term “alkynyl” whether used alone or as part of a substituent group, includes an alkyl group having at least one triple bond between any two adjacent carbon atoms. As used herein, the term “unsubstituted alkyl”, “unsubstituted alkenyl”, and “unsubstituted alkynyl” refers to alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups that do not contain heteroatoms. The phrase “substituted alkyl”, “substituted alkenyl”, and “substituted alkynyl” refers to alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups as defined above in which one or more bonds to a carbon(s) or hydrogen(s) are replaced by a bond to non-hydrogen or .non-carbon atoms such as, but not limited to, a halogen atom in halides such as F, Cl, Br, and I; and oxygen atom in groups such as carbonyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl groups, alkoxy groups, aryloxy groups, and ester groups; a sulfur atom in groups such as thiol groups, alkyl and aryl sulfide groups, sulfone groups, sulfonyl groups, and sulfoxide groups; a nitrogen atom in groups such as amines, amides, alkylamines, dialkylamines, arylamines, alkylarylamines, diarylamines, N-oxides, imides, enamines imines, oximes, hydrazones, and nitrites; a silicon atom in groups such as in trialkylsilyl groups, dialkylarylsilyl groups, alkyldiarylsilyl groups, and triarylsilyl groups; and other heteroatoms in various other groups. Other alkyl groups include those in which one or more bonds to a carbon or hydrogen atom is replaced by a bond to an oxygen atom such that the substituted alkyl group contains a hydroxyl, alkoxy, aryloxy group, or heterocyclyloxy group. Still other alkyl groups include alkyl groups that have an amine, alkylamine, dialkylamine, arylamine, (alkyl)(aryl)amine, diarylamine, heterocyclylamine, (alkyl)(heterocyclyl)-amine, (aryl)(heterocyclyl)amine, or diheterocyclylamine group. As used herein, the term “unsubstituted aryl” refers to monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon groups having 6 to 12 carbon, atoms in the ring portion, such as, but not limited to, phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, biphenyl and diphenyl groups, that do not contain heteroatoms. Although the phrase “unsubstituted aryl” includes groups containing condensed rings such as naphthalene, it does not include aryl groups that have other groups such as alkyl or halo groups bonded to one of the ring members, as aryl groups such as tolyl are considered herein to be substituted aryl groups as described below. Unsubstituted aryl groups may be bonded to one or more carbon atom(s), oxygen atom(s), nitrogen atom(s), and/or sulfur atom(s) in the parent compound, however. As used herein, the term “substituted aryl group” has the same meaning with respect to unsubstituted aryl groups that substituted alkyl groups had with respect to unsubstituted alkyl groups. However, a substituted aryl group also includes aryl groups in which one of the aromatic carbons is bonded to one of the non-carbon or non-hydrogen atoms, such as, but not limited to, those atoms described above with respect to a substituted alkyl, and also includes aryl groups in which one or more aromatic carbons of the aryl group is bonded to a substituted and/or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group as defined herein. This includes bonding arrangements in which two carbon atoms of an aryl group are bonded to two atoms of an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group to define a fused ring system (e.g. dihydronaphthyl or tetrahydronaphthyl). Thus, the phrase “substituted aryl” includes, but is not limited to tolyl, and hydroxyphenyl among others. As used herein, the term “unsubstituted aralkyl” refers to unsubstituted or substituted Alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl groups as defined above in which a hydrogen or carbon bond of the unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group is replaced with a bond to an aryl group as defined above. For example, methyl (CH3) is an unsubstituted alkyl group. If a hydrogen atom of the methyl group is replaced by a bond to a phenyl group, such as if the carbon of the methyl were bonded to a carbon of benzene, then the compound is an unsubstituted aralkyl group (i.e., a benzyl group). As used herein, the term “substituted aralkyl” has the same meaning with respect to unsubstituted aralkyl groups that substituted aryl groups had with respect to unsubstituted aryl groups. However, a substituted aralkyl group also includes groups in which a carbon or hydrogen bond of the alkyl part of the group is replaced by a bond to a non-carbon or a non-hydrogen atom. As used herein, the term “unsubstituted heterocyclyl” refers to both aromatic and nonaromatic ring compounds including monocyclic, bicyclic, and polycyclic ring compounds such as, but not limited to, quinuclidyl, containing 3 or more ring members of which one or more is a heteroatom such as, but not limited to, N, O, and S. Although the phrase “unsubstituted heterocyclyl” includes condensed heterocyclic rings such as benzimidazolyl, it does not include heterocyclyl groups that have other groups such as alkyl or halo groups bonded to one of the ring members, as compounds such as 2-methylbenzimidazolyl are “substituted heterocyclyl” groups as defined below. Examples of heterocyclyl groups include, but are not limited to: unsaturated 3 to 8 membered rings containing 1 to 4 nitrogen atoms such as, but not limited to pyrrolyl, pyrrolinyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyridyl, dihydropyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl; saturated 3 to 8 membered rings containing 1 to 4 nitrogen atoms such as, but not limited to, pyrrolidinyl, imidazolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl; condensed unsaturated heterocyclic groups containing 1 to 4 nitrogen atoms such as, but not limited to, indolyl, isoindolyl, indolinyl, indolizinyl, benzimidazolyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, indazolyl, benzotriazolyl; unsaturated 3 to 8 membered rings containing 1 to 2 oxygen atoms and 1 to 3 nitrogen atoms such as, but not limited to, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, oxadiazolyl; saturated 3 to 8 membered rings containing 1 to 2 oxygen atoms and 1 to 3 nitrogen atoms such as, but not limited to, morpholinyl; unsaturated condensed heterocyclic groups containing 1 to 2 oxygen atoms and 1 to 3 nitrogen atoms, for example, benzoxazolyl, benzoxadiazolyl, bensoxazinyl (e.g. 2H-1,4-benzoxazinyl etc.); unsaturated 3 to 8 membered rings containing 1 to 3 sulfur atoms and 1 to 3 nitrogen atoms such as, but not limited to, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, thiadiazolyl (e.g. 1,2,3-thiadiazolyl, 1,2,4-thiadiaszolyl, 3,3,4-thiadiazolyl, 1,2,5-thiadiazolyl, etc); saturated 3 to 8 membered rings containing 1 to 2 sulfur atom's and 1 to 3 nitrogen atoms such as, but not limited to, thiazolodinyl; saturated and unsaturated 3 to 8 membered rings containing 1 to 2 sulfur atoms such as, but not limited to, thienyl, dihydrodithiinyl, dihydrodithionyl, tetrahydrothiophene, tetrahydrothiopyran; unsaturated condensed-heterocyclic rings containing 1 to 2 sulfur atoms and 1 to 3 nitrogen atoms such as, but not limited to, benzothiazolyl, benzothiadiazolyl, benzothiazinyl (e.g. 2H-1,4-benzothiazinyl, etc), dihydrobenzothiazinyl (e.g. 2H-3,4-dihydrobenzothiazinyl, etc.), unsaturated 3 to 8 membered rings containing oxygen atoms such as, but not limited to furyl; unsaturated condensed heterocyclic rings containing 1 to 2 oxygen atoms such as benzodioxolyl (e.g. 1,3-benzodioxoyl, etc.); unsaturated 3 to 8 membered rings containing an oxygen atom and 1 to 2 sulfur atoms such as, but not limited to, dihydrooxathinyl; saturated 3 to 8 membered rings containing 1 to 2 oxygen atoms and 1 to 2 sulfur atoms such as 1,4-oxathiane; unsaturated condensed rings containing 1 to 2 sulfur atoms such as benzothienyl, benzodithiinyl; and unsaturated condensed heterocyclic rings containing an oxygen atom and 1 to 2 oxygen atoms such as benzoxathiinyl. Heterocyclyl group also include those described above in which one or more S atoms in the ring is double-bonded to one or two oxygen atoms (sulfoxides and sulfones). For example, heterocyclyl groups include tetrahydrothiophene, tetrahydrothiophene oxide, and tetrahydrothiophene 1,1-dioxide. Preferred heterocyclyl groups contain 5 or 6 ring members. More preferred heterocyclyl groups include morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, imidazole, pyrazole, 1,2,3-triazole, 1,2,4-triazole, tetrazole, thiomorpholine, thiomorpholine in which the S atom of the thiomorpholine is bonded to one or more O atoms, pyrrole, homopiperazine, oxazolidin-2-one, pyrrolidin-2-one, oxazole, quinuclidine, thiazole, isoxazole, furan, and tetrahydrofuran. As used herein, the term “substituted heterocyclyl” has the same meaning with respect to unsubstituted heterocyclyl groups that substituted alkyl groups had with respect to unsubstituted alkyl groups. However, a substituted heterocyclyl group also includes heterocyclyl groups in which one of the carbons is bonded to one of the non-carbon or non-hydrogen atom, such as, but not limited to, those atoms described above with respect to a substituted alky and substituted aryl groups and also includes heterocyclyl groups in which one or more carbons of the heterocyclyl group is bonded to a substituted and/or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or aryl group as defined herein. This includes bonding arrangements in which two carbon atoms of an heterocyclyl group are bonded to two atoms of an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group to define a fused ring system. Examples, include, but are not limited to, 2-methylbenzimidazolyl, 5-methylbenzimidazolyl, 5-chlorobenzthiazolyl, 1-methyl piperazinyl, and 2-chloropyridyl among others. As used herein, the terns “unsubstituted heterocyclylalkyl” refers to unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl groups as defined above in which a hydrogen or carbon bond of the unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group is replaced with s bond to a heterocyclyl group as defined above. For example, methyl (CH3) is an unsubstituted alkyl group. If a hydrogen atom of the methyl group is replaced by a bond to a heterocyclyl group, such as if the carbon of the methyl were bonded to carbon 2 of pyridine (one of the carbons bonded to the N of the pyridine) or carbons 3 or 4 of the pyridine, then the compound is an unsubstituted heterocyclylalkyl group. As used herein, the term “substituted heterocyclylalkyl” has the same meaning with respect to unsubstituted heterocyclylalkyl groups that substituted aryl groups had with respect to unsubstituted aryl groups. However, a substituted heterocyclylalkyl group also includes groups in which a non-hydrogen atom is bonded to a heteroatom in the heterocyclyl group of the heterocyclylalkyl group such as, but not limited to, a nitrogen atom in the piperidine ring of a piperidinylalkyl group. GENERAL DESCRIPTION Polyoxazolines (POZ) are polymers prepared from 2-substituted-2-oxazoline monomers. These polymers are water soluble and have been reported to be nontoxic in mammalian model Systems. POZ is generally prepared by reaction of the appropriate stoichiometric amount of 2-alkyl-2-oxazoline with an electrophilic initiator, such as methyl triflate (CH3—OSO2—CF3) or a strong acid such as triflic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid, followed by termination with a nucleophile such as but not limited to, hydroxide, a thiol or an amine. The polymer produced is conveniently described in shorthand with the initiating group designated by the leftmost group and the terminating group designated by the rightmost group, with the 2-alkyl-2-oxazoline component in the middle. Therefore, when this shorthand description is used in the current specification, it is intended that the left side of the designation presents the “initiator end” and the right side of the designation presents the “termination end”, unless designated otherwise. For example, when the 2-alkyl-2-oxazoline is 2-methyl-2-oxazoline, methyl triflate is used as the initiator and hydroxide is used as the terminator, the following POZ is produced: [in-line-formulae]CH3—[N(COCH3)CH2CH2]n-OH[/in-line-formulae] The polymer above is conveniently described in shorthand notation as M-PMOZ-OH, in which the methyl initiator is designated by the leftmost M, PMOZ represents polymethyloxazoline with the methyl of the repeating unit designated by the M of PMOZ, and the terminating hydroxyl is designated by the —OH. Another commonly used monomer is 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline, which with methyl triflate initiation and hydroxide termination would provide the following POZ polymer: [in-line-formulae]CH3—[N(COCH2)CH2CH2]n-OH[/in-line-formulae] The polymer above is conveniently described in shorthand notation as M-PEOZ-OH, in which the methyl initiator is designated by the leftmost M, PEOZ represents polymethyloxazoline with the ethyl of the repeating unit designated by the E of PEOZ, and the terminating hydroxyl is designated by the —OH. The degree of polymerization, n, for well characterized polymers can range from approximately 3 to about 1000. The polymerization process is referred to as a living, cationic polymerization since initiation with an electrophile produces an oxazolinium cation that then reacts in a chain reaction with additional monomer units to produce a growing, “living” cation. One can predict the products of termination by assuming that the living cation can be represented in the following non-cyclic form (for polymerization of 2-methyl-2-oxazoline initiated with methyl triflate), although in reality the cyclic form is certainly the most important: [in-line-formulae]CH3—[N(COCH3)CH2CH2]nN(COCH3)CH2CH2+[/in-line-formulae] In the current discussion we will represent this cation as M-PMOZ+. As noted above, this POZ cation can be “terminated” by reacting with nucleophiles such as hydroxide, thiols or amines. Oxazoline polymerization can also be initiated with functional electrophiles. For example the electrophilic initiator ethyl 3-bromopropionate has been used to initiate 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline polymerization. Termination with hydroxide gives the following polymer: [in-line-formulae]HO2C—CH2CH2—[N(COCH2CH3)CH2CH2]n-OH[/in-line-formulae] Yet another route to preparing polyoxazolines with functional groups is to copolymerize a monomer such as 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline with an oxazoline monomer having a functional group in the 2-position (F. C. Gaertner, R. Luxenhofer, B. Blochert, R. Jordan and M. Essler, J. Controlled Release, 2007, 119, 291-300). For example, Jordan and colleagues have prepared oxazolines with acetylenes and protected aldehydes, carboxylic acids and amines in the 2-position. Copolymerization of these functional monomers with 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline gives random copolymers with multiple pendent or side-chain functional groups. For example, initiation with methyl triflate of polymerization of 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline and 2-pentynyl-2-oxazoline, followed by termination with piperazine (NHC4H8NH) gives the following random copolymer: [in-line-formulae]CH3—{[N(COCH2CH3]n-[N(COCH2CH2CH2—CCH))CH2CH2]m}NC4H8NH[/in-line-formulae] The subscript “ran” indicates that the polymer is a random copolymer. Values of n are typically around 20-30 while m is around 2-5. These copolymers with pendent functional groups and a terminal functional group are useful in that the pendent and terminal functional groups can be “chemically orthogonal” functional groups. Chemically orthogonal functional groups are those functional groups that will not react with each other but will react selectively with other functional groups. For example, the molecule above has two functional groups, a terminal secondary amine and pendent acetylenes. The acetylene will not react with the amine but will, for example, react with an azide group (—N3). Similarly, the amine will not react with acetylene or azide but will react with for example, an isothiocyanate group (—NCS). Jordan has used this copolymer to couple an azide-functionalized RGD peptide to the acetylene group, and an isothiocyanate-functionalized metal chelator to the amine. The RGD peptide is known to target tumors, and a diagnostic or therapeutic radionuclide can bind to the chelating group. The final conjugate can be used to image or treat tumors (R. Luxenhofer, M. Lopez-Garcia, A. Frannk, H. Kessler and R. Jordan, Proceedings of the American Chemical Society, PMSE Prepr. 2006, 95, 283-284). One problem hindering use of the above piperazine- or piperidine-terminated polyoxazolines is that they are difficult to purify. This difficulty arises because contaminating water present during termination leads to nucleophilic attack by water and consequent formation of secondary amine impurity (O. Nuyken, G. Maier, A. Gross, Macromol. Chem. Phys. 197, 83-95, 1996). Since the products from piperazine and piperidine termination always contain a tertiary amine, ion-exchange chromatography cannot be used to remove the contaminating secondary amine. Still another limitation of the pendent polyoxazolines illustrated above is that these compounds possess a single terminal functional group. Consequently, this structural configuration limits the number of drug or targeting moieties that can be attached to the terminus, whereas effective use of such compounds for therapeutic diagnostic and targeting applications may require multiple loading of these moieties. The polymers of the current disclosure avoid this limitation by providing for multiple copies of each of two chemically reactive and orthogonal functional groups. Novel Heterofunctional Polyoxazoline Derivatives The present disclosure avoids the limitations of the prior art by providing heterofunctional polyoxazoline derivatives of two 2-substituted-2-oxazolines comprising at least two functional groups which are chemically reactive and chemically orthogonal to one another. The heterofunctional polyoxazoline derivatives may contain additional functional groups as well. In certain embodiments, all functional groups are chemically orthogonal to one another, while in other embodiments, the additional, functional groups may be chemically orthogonal to at least one other functional group present on the heterofunctional polyoxazoline derivative. Single-Arm Heterofunctional Polyoxazoline Derivatives In one embodiment, the heterofunctional polyoxazoline derivative is represented by the General structure: [in-line-formulae]R1—{[N(COX)CH2CH2]n-[N(COY)CH2—CH2)]m}a-Z[/in-line-formulae] wherein: R1 is an initiating group;X is a pendent moiety containing a first functional group;Y is a pendent moiety containing a second functional group;Z is a terminating nucleophile; in certain embodiments Z is inert (i.e., does not contain a functional group); in other embodiments, Z contains a third functional group;a is ran which indicates a random copolymer or block which indicates a block copolymer; ando and m are each an integer independently selected from 1-50. Exemplary initiating groups include, but are not limited to, hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aralkyl, or substituted aralkyl groups. In a particular embodiment, the initiating group is a methyl group. The R1 group is selected to lack a functional group. Additional exemplary initiating groups are disclosed in PCT Application No. PCT/US2008/078159, which is hereby incorporated by reference for such teaching. As shown by the general structure above, the heterofunctional polyoxazoline derivative comprises at least two functional groups. The first and second functional groups are present on the pendent moieties X and Y, respectively. In certain embodiment, a third functional group is present on the Z group; however, the presence of the third functional group is optional and in some embodiments Z may be inert (i.e., lacking the third functional group). X and Y are pendent moieties bearing first and second functional groups, respectively. In certain embodiments, X and Y may contain a linking portion that links the first and second functional groups to the polyoxazoline derivative. Exemplary linking portions include alkylene groups. In certain cases, the alkylene group is a C1-C15 alkylene group. The linking portions of X and Y may be the same or may be different.

Exemplary R1 groups include, but not limited to, hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aralkyl, or substituted aralkyl groups. In a particular embodiment, the initiating group is a methyl group. The R1 group is selected to lack a functional group. Additional exemplary initiating groups are disclosed in PCT Application No. PCT/US2008/078159, which is hereby incorporated by reference for such teaching. As shown by the general structure above, the heterofunctional polyoxazoline derivative comprises at least two functional groups. The first end second functional groups are present on the pendent moieties X and Y, respectively. In certain embodiment, a third functional group is present on the Z group; however, the presence of the third functional group is optional and in some embodiments Z, may be inert (i.e., lacking the third functional group). X and Y are pendent moieties bearing first and second functional groups, respectively. In certain embodiments, X and Y may contain a linking portion that links the first and second functional groups to the polyoxazoline derivative. Exemplary linking portions include alkylene groups. In certain cases, the alkylene group is a C1-C15 alkylene group. The linking portions of X and Y may be the same or may be different. For example, both X and Y may contain a C5 alkylene group as the linking portion or X may contain a C5 alkylene group as the linking portion and Y may contain a C5 alkylene group as the linking portion. Z may contain a third functional group or be inert. In those embodiments where Z contains a third functional group, the third functional group may be chemically orthogonal to one or both of the first and second functional groups. The first, second and third functional groups include, but are not limited to, alkyne, amine, oxyamine, aldehyde, ketone, acetal, ketal, maleimide, ester, carboxylic acid, activated carboxylic acid (such as, but not limited to, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS) and 1-benzotriazineyl active ester), an active carbonate, a chloroformate, alcohol, azide, vinyl sulfone, or orthopyridyl disulfide (OPSS), provided that the selection is made so that at least two of the first, second and third functional groups are chemically orthogonal to one another. Q is optional and can be any group capable of forming linkages with both the R and Z and will be different depending on the chemistry of the R and Z. Representative Q groups include, but are not limited to, substituted and unsubstituted alkylene groups. In a specific embodiment, Q is —(CH2)p, where p is independently selected from 1-10.

In the general structure above, at least two of the first, second and third functional groups must be present. Therefore, when m or n is 0 for each POZ chain, Z cannot be inert. Several embodiments of the multi-armed heterofunctional polyoxazoline derivative falling under the general structure above are presented below. EXAMPLE 1 In this example, d is 2, k is 1, K is —S—(CH2)p-CO—, where p is an integer from 1-10, for each polyoxazoline chain, q is 0, R is NH—CH—(CH2)3—CH2—NH and the first and second functional groups are chemically orthogonal to one another; Z may be chemically orthogonal to one or both of the first and second functional groups.

EXAMPLE 3 In this example, d is 4, k is 1 and K is —S—(CH2)2—CO—NH for each polyoxazoline chain, q and m are 0, R is —(CH2)4—CH—CO—NH—(CH2)4—CH—NH-CO—CH—(CH2)4— and the first and third functional groups may be chemically orthogonal to one another. EXAMPLE 4 In this example, d, k, K, q, m and R are as in Example 3 and Z is CO2H and the first and third functional groups may be chemically orthogonal to one another. In all of the above embodiments, the polyoxazoline polymers contained in the heterofunctional polyoxazoline derivatives may be random or block copolymers. As used herein, a block copolymer includes those copolymers that have block configurations separated by a random copolymer sequence. Such random and block copolymers may be produced by controlling the introduction of various intermediates during the synthesis process as described below. Furthermore, in all the embodiments discussed above, one or more of the functional groups may be charged species. For example, one or more of the functional groups may be a carboxylic acid having s negative charge or an amine having a positive charge. As such, the functional groups may form ionic linkages with one or more target molecules. Methods of Synthesis In one embodiment, the polymers of the present disclosure are prepared by co-polymerization of appropriate 2-substituted-2-oxazolines containing functional groups. For example, preparation of a water-soluble co-polymer bearing alkyne groups and acetal groups, in addition to a simple 2-alkyl-2-oxazoline can be synthesized using the following oxazoline monomers; The polymerization is initiated by an electrophile such as, but not limited to, methyl triflate, methyl tosylate, p-toluenesulfonic acid, or triflic acid. The co-polymerization can be terminated by a nucleophilic reagent as discussed herein. If terminal functionality is desired, a functionalized terminating agent, such as but not limited to, methyl thiolacetate can be used. For a non-reactive termination terminus, a nucleophile such as an alkyl mercaptan can be used. Similarly a terminating hydroxyl group is also unreactive to many reagents and can therefore be useful in this application. Preferred solvents for the polymerization are chlorobenzene or acetonitrile. The preferred temperature range is from about 40° C. to about 120° C. The time required for the polymerization is dependent on the temperature, the desired molecular weight, and the solvent and can range from about 1 h to about 100 h. In certain embodiments, it is desirable to limit the polymerization reaction to the time required to substantially complete the polymerization reaction. In one embodiment, the progress of the polymerization reaction is monitored using MALDI and/or GPC. The polymerization can be conducted in several ways. In one embodiment, a mixture of the appropriate oxazoline components can be reacted with the initiator in a preferred solvent with stirring. This reaction yields a random copolymer when the oxazoline components are equally reactive with one another or s block copolymer when one or more of the oxazoline components are less reactive towards one another. In an alternate embodiment, the polymer may also be synthesized in blocks by initiating polymerization with an appropriate initiator in a preferred solvent using only one oxazoline component. The reaction, may be monitored with MALDI or GPC to determine when the reaction is substantially complete. When polymerization of the first block is complete, a second oxazoline component is added to reinitiate the polymerization with the incipient living cation at the terminus of the polymer chain; monitoring of the polymerization reaction may be carried out as described. The solvent may be the same as in the first polymerization reaction or different; the reaction temperature and other variables may also be adjusted as desired. Upon completion of the polymerization of the second block, a third oxazoline component is added to reinitiate the polymerization with the living cation at the terminus of the polymer chain; monitoring of the polymerization reaction may be carried out as described. The solvent may be the same as in the first or second polymerization reactions or different; the reaction temperature and other variables may also be adjusted as desired. When the third polymerization step is completed, the polymerization may be terminated by the addition of a terminating agent. The oxazoline components may contain functional groups, or may lack a functional group. The sequential polymerizations can be dons in any order. In another embodiment, random copolymerization of two of the oxazoline monomers, followed by continued polymerization of a third block can also be done to produce a polymer having both random and block configurations. In one embodiment, one of the oxazoline monomers lacks a functional group. Once the desired polymerization process is completed, the polymer is precipitated, such as in ethyl ether, several times and dried under vacuum. The polymer may be further characterized by standard techniques such as but not limited to MALDI, NMR, and GPC. Work with polyethylene glycol has shown that it is frequently necessary in modification of target molecules to utilize polymers of molecular weights (MWs) of 20,000 Da or higher and molecular weight distributions, or polydispersities (PDs), of less than 1.1. There has been a great deal of work showing that MWs and PDs in the above range cannot be achieved for POZ chains with conventional techniques. As is known in the art PD values will vary with MW; in general, as the molecular weight increases the PD value also increases. It is generally seen that as the molecular weight of growing POZ chains reaches approximately 5,000 Da, the polydispersity increases appreciably. Side reactions, including, but not limited to, chain transfer, begin to grow in importance. The prior art techniques described above when used to generate POZ chains of high MW produce POZ derivatives with unacceptable PD values. The polyoxazoline derivatives of the present disclosure may be produced using polyoxazoline chains that are manufactured using novel methods that result in polyoxazoline derivatives with low PD values and a decreased amount of impurities produced by unwanted side reactions, such as, but not limited to, chain transfer. In one embodiment, the polyoxazoline chains are manufactured to minimize unwanted side reactions, such as, but not limited to, chain transfer, allowing the production of POZ derivatives of increased purity with low PD values. Therefore, the POZ derivatives of the present disclosure may be produced with increased purity and with low PD values suitable for use in pharmaceutical applications. Such methods are described in PCT Application No. PCT/US2008/078159, which is hereby incorporated by reference for such teaching. Use of the Heterofunctional Polyoxazoline Derivatives The heterofunctional polyoxazoline derivatives of the present disclosure possess two or more chemically orthogonal functional groups and thus allow for attachment of two or more different target molecules to the polymer. The novel heterofunctional polyoxazoline derivatives prepared as described above are intended for formation of conjugates with various target molecules, such as, but not limited to, therapeutic, diagnostic and targeting moieties (target molecule-POZ conjugates). Various combinations of target molecules may be incorporated into the target molecule-POZ conjugate. In one embodiment, the target molecule-POZ conjugate contains a therapeutic moiety and a targeting moiety, a diagnostic moiety and s targeting moiety or a diagnostic moiety, a therapeutic moiety and a targeting moiety. Target molecules include, but are not limited to, polypeptides such as, but not limited to, interferons (including alpha, beta and gamma), growth hormone, peptide hormones (including luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone, LHRH), interleukins, enzymes, antibodies (including antibody fragments and monoclonal antibodies), blood factors (including GCSF, erythropoietin, and Factor VIII) and insulin. Target molecules further include, but are not limited to, carbohydrates, oligonucleotides and small-molecule therapeutics. Exemplary targeting moieties include, but are not limited to, folate, LHRH peptide and glucosamine. Exemplary small molecule therapeutics include, but are not limited to gemcitabine, irinotecan, zidovudine, and diclofenac. The heterofunctional polyoxazoline derivatives of the present disclosure, possessing functional groups that have orthogonal chemistries, are ideally suited for preparation of polyoxazoline derivatives linked to target molecules with distinct fractions. Such an approach is possible due to the presence of two or more functional groups on the polyoxazoline derivative that are chemically orthogonal to one another. As a result, target molecules with different linkage chemistries can be incorporated into the polyoxazoline derivative in a controlled, directed manner. Such an approach is capable of producing targeted polyoxazoline therapeutic and/or diagnostic conjugates. Exemplary active groups, binding partners on target molecules and linkages formed there between are disclosed in PCT Application No. PCT/US2008/078159, which is hereby incorporated by reference for such teaching. Exemplary reaction chemistries for the attachment of various target molecules are described herein and exemplified in the Examples section. However, the teaching of the present disclosure should not be limited to such reactions chemistries as the present disclosure provides the requisite teaching to couple various target molecules to the heterofunctional polyoxazoline derivatives of the present disclosure. In one embodiment, the target molecule may a therapeutic and/or diagnostic agent and a targeting agent. The linkages to the target molecule may be hydrolytically stable or hydrolytically unstable or a combination thereof. However, in one embodiment, all linkages in the polyoxazoline derivative itself are hydrolytically stable. For example, an ester linkage to a target molecule would be hydrolytically unstable in vivo, while an amide linkage would be stable for an extended period of time. The described polyoxazoline derivatives provide a wide range of options in linking target molecules to the described polymer structure. Depending on the number of functional groups present; the number of target molecules linked to the polyoxazoline derivative can be varied from 1 to at least 100. The target molecule-POZ conjugates may be used in methods of treatment to treat various disease states. In one embodiment, the disease state to be treated is defined by the nature of the target molecules incorporated into the target molecule-POZ conjugate, such as for example, the therapeutic moiety and/or the targeting moiety. The examples described herein provide target molecule-POZ conjugates containing a therapeutic moiety and/or a targeting moiety and describe the use of such conjugates in the treatment of cancer and target molecule-POZ conjugates containing anti-viral (zidovudine) and anti-inflammatory (diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent) compounds. As such, the present disclosure provides methods of treating cancer, viral infections and conditions and diseases treatable by NSAID compounds (including arthritis, osteoarthritis, back pain, sciatica, sprains, dental pain, post operative pain, period paid, headaches, migraine and inflammatory conditions as well as reducing the incidence of heart attack and stroke). Those examples are provided for illustration only and are not intended to restrict the recited methods of treatment of the foregoing conditions and diseases. In one embodiment, the present disclosure describes the use of target molecule-POZ conjugates to treat and/or prevent various diseases and conditions in a subject in need of such treatment and/or prevention. In one embodiment, the diseases and conditions include, but not limited to, cancer, viral infections arthritis, osteoarthritis, back pain, sciatica, sprains, dental pain, post operative pain, period paid; headaches, migraine and inflammatory conditions as well as reducing the incidence of heart attack and stroke. The method of treatment and/or prevention comprises the step of administering a target molecule-POZ conjugate of the present disclosure to the subject. The method may also comprise identifying a subject in need of such treatment in a specific embodiment, the target molecule-POZ conjugate is administered in a therapeutically effective amount. Such administration of the target molecule-POZ conjugate would thereby treat the disease or condition. As discussed above, the results of such methods need not be absolute to provide benefit in the treatment methods disclosed.

Exemplary polyacetals polymers include those polymers described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,811,510, 5,863,990 and 5,958,398 (each of which is incorporated by reference for such teachings). Such polyacetals polymers are produced by oxidative degradation of polysaccharides. Such polyacetals polymers contain acetal functional groups as pendent groups. Furthermore, terminal groups can be created to provide a hemiacetal group at the reduced end of the polyacetals, which can be readily and selectively transformed into a carboxylic acid group and further into a variety of other functional groups. A primary alcohol group at the non-reduced end can be selectively transformed into an aldehyde group and further into a variety of functional groups.
