"Nanoparticulate systems for vehiculating drugs for the treatment of Leishmania infection-related pathologies" Technical Field of the Invention The present invention relates to nanoparticle systems as carriers of drugs for the treatment of pathologies related to the infections with Leishmania. In particular, the invention relates to nanoparticle systems of polymeric nature as effective vehicles of compounds based on antimony, also antimonials, for example N-metilglucamine antimoniate (Glucantime®). More in particular, the more used active principle for the treatment of pathologies related to infection with Leishmania, was encapsulated into the aqueous "core" (internal part) of nanocapsules enclosed within an external layer or polylactic acid (PLA) "shell". Said nanocapsules allow reducing the toxicity of the antimonial compounds in the cells and modulating their biopharmaceutical properties while keeping their pharmacological effectiveness unchanged. Background Art Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Leishmania and that are spread by biting insects belonging to the subfamily Phlebotominae, among which the insects known in Italy with the name "pappataci". The protozoan spread by the insect bite propagate inside the reticuloendothelial cells of the guest (macrophages, reticular spleen cells, lungs, bone marrow and lymphnodes, Kupfer cells in the liver) in its replicating intracellular form (amastigote). It is calculated that about 12 million people in the world suffer from leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis can affect both animals and humans and can be divided into three different types: Cutaneous leishmaniasis, the form that most commonly develops at the bite site. It takes a long time to heal and leaves very visible scars. This form can progress into: Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, particularly difficult to treat; Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, especially localized in the nose and in the mouth; Visceral leishmaniasis, the most serious form and potentially fatal if not treated. Antimonials are pharmaceutical compounds based on pentavalent antimony (Sbv) that are the standard treatment for the cure of canine and human leishmaniasis even though they are extremely toxic compounds. In particular, meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime®, MA), a pentavalent antimony compound having properties similar to those of another pentavalent antimony compound, i.e., sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam®), is used in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (Kala-azar, black fever), caused by different species of Leishmania donovani complex: L. donovani donovani, L. infantum e L. chagasi. In addition, this compound is also used in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by different species among which L. major, L. tropica e L. braziliensis. The antimonials' mechanism of action is linked to the inhibition of the parasite's glycolytic activity and fatty acid oxidation inhibition, thus favoring a reduction in the antioxidant defensive mechanisms and the depletion of the ATP reserves that represent the energy needed for the parasite's survival (Frezard et al., 2009). Unfortunately, among the side effects that appear after the therapy with meglumine antimoniate are tubular renal insufficiency (as a consequence of the decreased drug clearance, in this regard see Ikeda-Garcia et al., 2007; Bianciardi et al., 2009; de Moura et al., 2008), liver and pancreatic function alterations and cardiac arrhythmias (Berman, 1997). Notwithstanding their toxicity, from the Second World War antimonial drugs have been and still are the first line treatment for leishmaniasis, mostly because the alternative drugs that have been studied and marketed, for example pentamidine, amphotericin B and miltefosine, are not valid alternatives from the pharmacological and clinical point of view (Guerin et al., 2002). The polymeric nanoparticles offer the possibility of making nanosystems that are able to modify the biopharmaceutical features of the enclosed compounds (Pitarresi et al., 2007; Trapani et al., 2011), reducing their toxic side effects, as the result of a decrease in the number of administrations and of a better pharmacological action (Laquintana et al., 2009; Acharya e Sahoo. 2011; Celia et al., 2011). It must be noticed that the molecular weight of the polymer, for example PLA or PLGA, used to make the nanocapsules can deeply influence important chemical, physical, and biological properties of the particles obtained, such as, for example, the Entrapment Efficiency and the ability to carry their contents into cells (Marchais et al., 1998; Zambaux et al., 1999; Li et al., 2013). Moreover, also the preparation method of the nanoparticles and the chemical nature of the compounds to be encapsulated influence their useful features for the pharmacological use. The use of polylactic acid-based nanocapsules is known as the vehicle for compounds that are very different from antimonials, for example gemcitabine hydrochloride (Paolino et al., 2012) and insulin (Yinyan Zhu et al, 2005). The pharmaceutical use of polylactic acid PLA has been approved by Food and Drug Administration (Anderson and Shive. 1997). Regarding antimonials, different approaches have been studied in order to improve their pharmacological effectiveness. For example, MA was encapsulated in a liposomal formulation of distearoylfosphatidylcoline, cholesterol and diacetyl phosphate (molar ratio 5:4:1), obtaining a reduction in the toxicity in mongrel dogs suffering from visceral leishmaniasis (Ribeiro et al., 2008). Unfortunately, the liposomal pharmaceutical formulation based on antimonials has not been marketed, probably due to technological issues met during the preparation of stable liposomal formulations for carrying hydrosoluble active principles (Frezard e Demicheli. 2010). Different strategies were also used to modulate the biodistribution and the pharmacological effectiveness of antimonials, such as, for example, complex formation with beta-cyclodextrins (Frezard et al., 2008; Ribeiro et al., 2010), encapsulation into chitosan microparticles, obtained by the spray-drying method (Pujals et al., 2008) and simple chemical modifications of their structure (Frezard et al., 2009). All these therapeutical approaches never reached clinics because they did not show to have the required biopharmaceutical and safety features. Navaei et. al. (2014) and WO 2013/010238A1 describe the preparation of PLGA microspheres that carry antimonial compounds. Such microspheres, anyway, due to their dimensions, are not useful for the parenteral use, in particolar the endovenous one, as is instead possible using nanoparticles such as those of the invention. Kumar et al. (2014) describes PLGA peghilated nanoparticles encapsulated with anti-CD 14 antibodies containing sodium stibogluconate. Anyway, only the dimensions (10 - 15 nanometre) and the level of antiparasitic activity vs. non-entrapped stibogluconate are described. This document does not describe at all important features of the nanoparticles, such as, for example: their entrapment efficiency (EE), the release profile for the antimoniate in time in macrophage cells, the trend of the interaction with the macrophage cells, the cell toxicity of the antimoniate carried by the nanoparticle system described vs. the antimoniate with no carrier, the biodistribution of the antimoniate carried by the system described vs. the antimoniate with no carrier. The listed features do not seem to be particularly effective in the system described by Kumar. In the absence of prior art documents that show obtaining carrier systems that increase the effectiveness of antimonial drugs to blood cell parasites, such as Leishmania, in the presence of a corresponding decrease of systemic toxicity, it is possible to say that it is still very much felt the need in the pediatric and in the veterinary fields for less toxic and more effective formulations of an antimonial drug, for example MA, for the treatment of the different forms of leishmaniasis in humans and animals, in particular in dogs. It has now been found a new nanoparticle formulation that solves these problems left unsolved by the prior art. Summary of the Invention It is, therefore, the object of the present invention a polymeric nanoparticle system of polylactic acid that efficiently encapsulates antimonial drugs, in particular N-methylglucamine antimoniate (from now on also MA or Glucantime®) in systems made of an aqueous nucleus (core) in which the active principle is entrapped, surrounded by a polymeric biocompatible and biodegradable shell based on polylactic acid, so that the compound is carried and concentrated within the guest's macrophages, thus avoiding the appearance of the typical toxic systemic effects linked to the therapy with antimonial drugs. A further object are the pharmaceutical compositions comprising the nanoparticle system carrying drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis, in particular antimonials, more in particular MA, and suitable excipients pharmaceutically approved. It is a still further object of the present invention the method for the manufacture of said carrier nanoparticle system for antimonial drugs. It is a still further object of the present invention the use of the biocompatible and biodegradable polymer nanoparticles based on polylactic acid of the invention for the treatment and prevention of the spreading of pathologies related to Leishmania infections in animals and humans. Further objects will be evident from the following detailed description of the invention.

Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention relates to the encapsulation of antimony- based compounds. Known as antimonials, such as, for example, Glucantime® and Pentostam®, in polylactic acid nanoparticles to obtain a more efficient way to carry this active principle within the cells and the organs infected with parasites of the genus Leishmania in humans and animals, in particular dogs, and, at the same time, to decrease its systemic toxicity. Particularly preferred is MA. Within the scope of the present invention the terms "nanocapsules" and "nanoparticles" are used as synomims and refer to particles having in general dimensions from 900 to 20 nm, preferably 800-50 nm. The nanoparticles according to the invention are made of an external polylactic acid (PLA) layer or "shell" and an inner part or "core" that comprises an antimonial compound in aqueous solution. Polylactic acid has an average molecular weight of 20-200 kDalton, preferably 20-160 kDalton,, more preferably 85-160 kDalton. In preliminary experiments not shown here, the use of low molecular weight PLA (<20kDalton) gave a very disappointing entrapment efficiency, <10%, with respect to the antimonial product used for the preparation of the nanocapsules. 1.0 Procedure for the Preparation of the Nanocapsules of the Invention. The encapsulation process of the invention comprises the following steps: (i) preparing an aqueous suspension by mixing the antimonial compound with polylactic acid, a lipophilic non-ionic detergent, and an organic solvent; (ii) homogenizing the suspension obtained according the previous step and adding an aqueous phase containing a non-ionic hydrophilic detergent; (iii) evaporating under stirring until the nanoparticles are formed: (iv) optionally washing and finally purifying the nanoparticles with water. With reference to step (i), the preparation of the aqueous suspension can be carried out, for example, by means of sonication in ice bath or homogenization. The non-ionic lipophilic detergent can be chosen from Span 80, 60, 40 and can be added up to a concentration of, 0.1-5% w/v; the organic solvent can be acetone, hexane, tetrahydrofurane (THF), ethyl ether, methanol, dichloromethane, chloroform and mixtures thereof with the aim to obtain a homogeneous dispersion of the organic phase in a polar milieu, in particular an aqueous milieu. With reference to step (ii), the homogenization can be carried out, for example, with Ultraturrax. The non-ionic hydrophilic detergent can be Tween 80, 60, 40 e 20 sodium deoxycholate, polyols such as glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, mannitol and mixtures thereof. With reference to step (iii), solvent evaporation can be carried out at room temperature. 2.0 Characterization of the Nanoparticles of the Invention 2.1 Stability and Entrapment Efficiency The data of Table 1 (see further on below, in the "Examples" section) show the particularly desirable chemical and physical features of the nanoparticles obtained using sodium deoxycholate (SD) in the second aqueous phase according to the invention: the average size of the particles increased with the increasing of the amount of MA present; their polydispersion index, that is an index of the dimensional distribution of the systems, was from 0.1 to 0.2 (particles with very similar average diameter); the decrease in the variability of ζ potential, from -35 to -40 mV, points to a noteworthy stability of the particles themselves. The ζ potential is a parameter used to identify the superficial charge in systems of particles. In the same preparative conditions, the nanoparticles formulate with Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) showed a certain variability in their dimensional distribution (IP= 0.5-0.75). Still, the results showed that both the surfactants were adequate for parenteral administration in terms of dimensional variability of the nanoparticles in the presence of increasing concentrations of MA. Anyway, as shown in Figure 1 and again with reference to Table 1, the entrapment efficiency (EE) of increasing amounts of the active principle MA by the nanoparticles prepared in the presence of 1% SD w/v, used in the second aqueous suspension step (see the preparation outline shown above), is higher with respect to the nanoparticles formulated using Tween 80 at the same concentration. The nanoparticles' stability, as shown in Figures 2-5 and with reference to Table 1, was studied using the Turbiscan Lab® Expert,, a tool that allows relating the stability of a colloidal system, in this case the nanoparticle system of the invention in aqueous solution, to its backscattering (BS) and transmittance (T) features (Celia et al., 2009). In Figure 2 are shown the profiles for formulation A (empty nanospheres of the invention); in Figure 3 are shown the profiles for formulation B (nanospheres of the invention prepared with 1 mg of MA; in Figure 4 are shown the profiles for formulation F prepared in the presence of 5 mg MA and in Figure 5 are shown the profiles for formulation G prepared in the presence of 10 mg MA, respectively. The results obtained show that the nanocapsules1 structure allows entrapment of great amounts of MA since the BS and T profiles do not show significant variations (<5%) with respect to those obtained by testing the empty formulation. Figures 2-5 thus clearly show that the polymeric nanocapsules of the invention correspondent to formulations B, F and G when compared with formulation A (nanoparticles not containing the active principle) can efficiently encapsulate MA without showing destabilization phenomena, as demonstrated by 5% both negatively and positively in all the analyzed samples). The results regarding the chemical and physical properties of the nanoparticles as described above brought to the selection of particles of G preparation (best mode of invention). As a matter of fact, these particles show an EE of 70% with respect to the 10 mg total of MA added to the system to prepare the nanoparticles of the invention, corresponding to 7 mg of entrapped active principle. Also, and more in particular, these are the particles that were proved to be able to encapsulate the greater amount of active principle among the ones tested, though showing at the same time an optimal stability, as shown in Table 1. 2.2 Release and Interaction with J774A.1 Cells The special vehiculation features of the nanocapsule system of the invention are shown herein below. The profile for the antimony release by the nanoparticles of formulation G of the invention is shown in Figure 6. The release was measured by means of the dialysis method, as described herein below in the "Examples" section, for 24 hours. As shown in said Figure, it is possible to notice a peculiar first stage of fast release after 4 hours (about 50%), followed by a slower and more gradual stage. As shown in Figure 7, cytotoxicity in J774A.1 cells (a murine macrophage/monocyte cell line) of the empty nanocapsules of the invention prepared so that they contained different concentrations of polylactic acid was first detected. Only PLA at high concentrations (> 1 /ml) did induce a significant toxicity in these cells, thus confirming its safety of use. The PLA concentrations used in the nanocapsules of the invention are lower than 1 g/ml). Figure 8 show that the nanoparticles of the invention loaded with an amount equivalent to 10 μΜ of pentavalent antimony, reach the best interaction level with the cells after 2 hours and keep it for more than 12 hours. After 24 hours of incubation this interaction wanes, probably due to the nanocapsules metabolization by the cells themselves. These results were obtained studying the interaction between polylactic acid nanocapsules and J774A.1 cells as a function of time, by using [3H]CHE (cholesteryl exadecyl ether radiolabeled with 3H) as described herein below in the section "Examples". Always in J774A.1 cells, the accumulation of pentavalent antimony vehiculated by the polylactic acid/MA nanoparticles containing sodium deoxycholate was studied. In Figure 9 it is clearly shown that Sb concentrated significantly more in cells treated with the nanocapsules of the invention with respect to the cells treated with Glucantime® alone. For the experimental details, see section "Examples" herein below. The nanoparticles of the invention positively interact with the cells efficiently vehiculating their contents inside the cells, as shown in Figures 10, 11, 12, and 13. The images were obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CSLM) always in J774A.1 cells treated for 4 hours with nanocapsules labelled with the fluorescent dye rhodamine (panel A). The cell nucleus was dyed with the dye Hoechst (panel B). In C is shown the superimposition of the two previous images. The diffuse and intense colour of cytoplasm in panel A is evident with no interaction with the cell nucleus. To confirm the surprising ability to vehiculate the antimonial compound, in Figure 14 is shown a CLSM microphotograph of J774A.1 cells treated for 1 hour with the nanoparticles of the invention that encapsulated the dyes rhodamine and Hoechst. It is evident that the efficiency of the interaction between the particles and the cells is such that, even after a short incubation period, the cell cytoplasm already presents with a diffuse fluorescence that does not involve the nucleus. 2.3 Toxicity Studies in J774A.1 Cells Vehiculation by means of the nanocapsules of the invention brings about a remarkable decrease of the pentavalent antimonial compound vs. an increase in effectiveness, as demonstrated by the following results. Toxicity toward macrophage cells was studied in J774A.1 infected with L. tropica and dyed with the Giemsa technique. In Figure 15 it is possible to observe the results obtained in this study. In panel A are shown the untreated cells, while in panel B are shown the cells treated with MA that is not carried by nanocapsules at an antimony dosage of 50 uM. The non-encapsulated antimonial compound caused a decrease in the number of cells and a remarkable change of their morphology with respect to the untreated macrophages and treated with the sane concentration of antimony encapsulated as MA in the nanocapsules of the invention (panels A and B, respectively). The treatment with the equivalent of 50 μΜ of Sbv of MA vehiculated by the nanocapsules of the invention (panel D), induced a remarkable decrease of parasites with respect to control vs. small morphological changes. The latter were not visible after incubation with 10 μΜ Sbv of MA vehiculated according to the invention (panel E). In Figure 16, these toxicity aspects and the change in the morphology of macrophages dyed with Giemsa caused by the antimonial compound used are even more evident. The cells treated with 50 g Sbv of unvehiculated MA were fewer with respect to the untreated cells (panel A) and to those treated with the same amount of antimony as MA vehiculated with the nanoparticles of the invention (panel C). The decrease in the cytoplasm amount and of the cell dimensions was also evident in the cells treated with non-vehiculated MA with respect to what was seen in the untreated cells or treated with vehiculated MA. 2.4 Biodistribution The features of the biodistribution profile of the nanocapsules of the invention were studied in B57 mice. Its particular features are described herein below. As shown in Figure 17, the empty nanocapsules labelled with [3H]CHE-polylactic acid administered into the caudal vein rapidly and preferentially are found in the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) cells of liver, spleen and lungs, rapidly disappearing from the bloodstream. In Figure 18 is shown the biodistribution profile for the Glucantime® (2,3 mg/kg Sbv) alone. It is evident the typical localization of this drug in kidney and heart tissues, which causes its observed toxicity in vivo. In Figure 19 are shown the results obtained using the same MA dose encapsulated in the nanocapsules of the invention. It is possible to see that the vehiculation of the active principle with the nanocapsules decreased its presence in the kidneys, at the same time increasing its presence in the bloodstream with respect to Glucantime® alone. These surprising features of the vehiculation of the antimonial compound shown in vivo by means of the nanocapsules of polylactic acid of the invention are an important advantage with respect to the use of to Glucantime® alone, decreasing its buildup in kidneys and heart and its resulting serious toxicity for these organs. The experimentally demonstrated advantages of the vehiculation of the ative principle MA with polylactic acid biodegradable polymeric particles according to the present invention are thus numerous. First of all, this vehiculation system allows encapsulating with great efficiency and in a reliable way therapeutically significant and useful amounts of N-meglumine antimoniate. In particular, the Encapsulation Efficiency (EE) is at least 50%, preferably 60%, more preferably 70% with respect to the antimonial present in the preparation mixture of the nanoparticles of the invention. The encapsulation efficiency obtained using PLA of molecular weight <20kDalton was, on the contrary, <10% with respect to the antimonial used for the preparation of the nanocapsules. Secondly, the nanoparticles of the invention containing MA effectively interact with macrophages, without damaging them or not altering in a significant way their morphology and functioning. Finally, the nanoparticles of the invention allow preserving the pharmacological activity of the active principle MA by decreasing its accumulation in heart and kidney tissues, which cause serious side and undesired affects seen in vivo, even though they cause, with respect to the non-encapsulated antimonial derivative, a prolonged presence in the bloodstream with respect to the antimonial derivative chosen. The same advantages can be also seen with different antimonial compounds, such as Pentostam®. 3.0 Formulations and Pharmacological Use The antimonial active principle vehiculated with polymeric biodegradable polylactic acid nanoparticles according to the present invention, can be conveniently formulated as known to the expert in the field for the paranteral administration. Advantageously, the amounts of antimonial active principle that can be encapsulated and that can be effective for the treatment of pathologies related to the infection with Leishmania as described above, are the same or are lower than the ones currently used for marketed antimonial products that range from 15 to 100 mg kg. Preferably the encapsulated antimonial concentration range is 1-7 mg. In the aqueous core of the nanoparticles of the invention, the antimonial compound can be advantageously associated with other active principles that potentiate its pharmacological effects, thus obtaining a co-delivery system. These active principles can, alternatively, be administered in association with the nanocapsules of the invention for a combined, simultaneous, sequential or retarded administration. An example of such different active principles is amphotericin B. The term "parenteral" refers to the administration of medicaments by injection through the teguments or directly in the bloodstream. Examples of parenteral administration are the administration by intradermal route (i.d.), subcutaneous route (s.c), intramuscular route (i.m.) and endovenous route (e.v.). The formulations containing the nanocapsules of the invention can comprise carriers (for example, water, saline solution, byffer solutions, oil components); stabilizers (for example, antioxidants); chelating agents (for example EDTA); antimicrobial agents; and all the excipients known to the expert in field and pharmaceutically acceptable for the preparation of drugs for parenteral use. The nanocapsules of the invention can be used for the treatment of pathologies related to the infection with Leishmania in animals and humans, such as those caused by Leishmania donovani complex: L. donovani donovani, L. infantum, L. chagasi, L. major, L. tropica e L. braziliensis. The pathologies in particular are: cutaneous leishmaniasis, diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, visceral leishmaniasis. The use of the nanocapsules also allows prevention or reduction of the side effects of traditional antimonials, linked in particular to the accumulation of SBV at the level of kidney and heart tissues. The nanocapsules can advantageously be administered in suitable dosages that the physician will choose in relation with the subject to be treated, of his physical conditions and of the seriousness of the pathology. Subjects that can be treated are humans and animals. Animals can be chosen from pets and wild animals, such as: dogs, cats, horses, ferrets, weasels, foxes, pigs, and from carnivorous birds, such as birds of prey. The following examples are to be considered as illustrative and not as limiting the scope of the invention. Examples Materials Poly-L-lactide (MW 85,000-160,000), hydrated sodium deoxycholate (SD), dimirystoyl-phospatidyl- ethanolamine, sulforhodamine B (DMPE-rhodamine), glycerol, phosphate buffered saline solution tabs, 3-[4,5- dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-3,5-diphenyltetrazole bromide salt (used for the MTT assays), dimethylsulphoxide and amphotericin B solution (250 pg/ml) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Milan, Italy). Sorbitan esters (Span®) and polysorbates (Tween®) were purchased from ACEF S.p.A. (Piacenza, Italy). Cells J774A.1 were purchased from Banca Biologica and Cell Factory - 1ST National Institute for Cancer Research (Genoa, Italy). Exadecyl [3H]-colesteryl ether ([3H]- CHE, 40 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Perkin Elmer (Monza, Italy). Dulbecco's modified essential medium (D-MEM) with glutamine, fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin-EDTA solution (Ix) and penicillin- streptomycin solution (100 UI/mL) were purchased from GIBCO (Invitrogen Corp., Giuliano Milanese (Mi), Italy). All the other materials and solvents used were analytical grade (Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy). The nanoparticles, prepared as described above, were used suspended in distilled water or, for the experiments with cells and for the in vivo experiments, in saline solution (0,9% w/v). The nanoparticles in aqueous solvent form colloidal systems, i.e. suspensions characterized by an average diameter of the solid phase components equal to or lower than 500 nm, preferably 100-350 nm. Example 1: Preparation of Polymeric Nanoparticles The chemical and physical features of the nanoparticles obtained according to the invention are summarized in Table 1 herein below. The polymeric nanocapsules were obtained by means of the method previously described in Paolino et al. (2012). Briefly, 1 ml of aqueous solution (containing different amounts of Glucantime, MA) was added to a polylactic acid (6 mg), Span (1% w/v), chlorophorm (2.5 ml) mixture and was sonicated for 2 minutes using a Sonopuls GM70 (Bandelin) at 30% of the maximal potency in an ice bath. Subsequently, the suspension obtained was added to an aqueous solution containing Tween 80 or SD (1% w/v) andf glycerol (1 ml) and homogenized at 24000 rpm for 1 minute with an Ultraturrax T25, IKA® Werke (Germany). The formulation was kept for 3 hours under stirring on a magnetic stirrer to allow solvents evaporation and the formation of the particellar systems. The nanoparticles, then, were washed three times with distilled water by ultracentrifugation (Optima TL Ultracentrifuge, Beckman), then suspended in distilled water to be stored at 4°C to the end of preventing destabilizing phenomena. The nanoparticles containing Glucantime were prepared by adding different amounts of the drug (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 mg of MA) to the first aqueous phase. Nanoparticles containing Pentostam® were prepared the same way. The fluorescent nanoparticles were prepared dissolving the rhodamine- DMPE (0,1% molarity) with the polymer in the organic phase during the preparation of the sample. To carry out the cytotoxicity in vitro, the aqueous solution used for the preparation of the nanoparticles was a saline solution (NaCl 0,9% w/v) to the end of avoiding osmotic stresses to the particles structure. Example 2: Determination of the Nanoparticles Size and Z Potential The average distribution of the size and of the Z potential were tested with a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worchester shire, Great Britain) apparatus based on the technology of light diffusion applied to microelectrophoresis, applying the third order cumulative adaptation function. A laser 4,5 mW diode operating at 670 nm was used as the light source for the size analysis and the reflected photons were detected at 173°. The actual and imaginary index were set at 1,59 and 0,0 respectively. The average refraction index (1.330), the average viscosity (1.0 mPa χ s) and the dielectric constant (80,4) were set before the experiments. For the analysis quartz cuvettes were used. To evaluate Z potential an F constant (Ka) of Smoluchowsky of 1,5 was used, as a function of the systems electrophoretic mobility. The different evaluations were carried out in triplicate in three different batches (10 evaluations for each batch). The results were expressed as the average ± standard deviation. Example 3: Antimonial Compound Entrapment Efficiency To evaluate the pentavalent antimony (Sbv) amount contained in the nanocapsules, a digestion procedure was used. Centrifuged polylactic acid nanocapsules were digested using a microwave digestion system Multiwave 300 (Anton-Paar), equipped with an XF100 rotor for eight 100 ml containers in fluoropolymer (operative pressure 60 bar). The samples were prepared with 2 ml HNO3 (65%, v/v, Merck) and 6 ml HC1 (34-37%, v/v, Carlo Erba). For each group of samples, one container chosen randomly was filled with reagents only and used as the blank for the whole procedure. After the digestion, the containers were left to cool and the digested solutions were transferred in 25 ml flasks and filled to the volume indicated using purified water by means of a Milli-Q (Millipore, France) system. The ICP-MS evaluations were carried out in a quadrupole XSERIES 2 ICP-MS system, (Thermo Fisher Scientific), operating at standard conditions. The samples were placed in a concentrical quartz nebulizer by means of a peristaltic pump (selected speed: 30 rpm). The concentration of the element was detected with respect to an external multielemental calibration standard of synthetic acid. The entrapment efficiency was calculated using the following equation: Entrapment efficiency (%) = (Sb amount in polylactic acid nanocapsules)/ (Sb amount initially added to polylactic acid nanocapsules) x 100 The experiments were carried out in triplicate for each batch. In the table below the data regarding the EE for the polylactic acid nanocapsules made with MW= 10000 are not reported, as they were <10%with respect to the amount of drug added, which is a very inadequate result from a technological point of view.

Example 4: Stability Studies of the Nanoparticles (Turbiscan Lab®) The Turbiscan Lab® is an optical analyzer that is able to identify the destabilizing phenomena in the samples to be analyzed by means of the multiple light diffusion (Celia et al., 2009; Celia et al., 2012). The instrument is made of an intermittent light source with a wavelength in the near infrared (880 nm) and of two synchronized detectors (transmittance and reflected diffusion). The emitted photon goes through the container with the sample in a cylindrical glass cell. The transmittance detector (T) can detect the photon (λ) that goes through the sample (at 0° with respect to the incident radiation), while the reflected diffusion detector (BS) detects the photon (λ) diffused by the sample (at 135° with respect to the incident radiation). The instrument was calibrated with a reflectance standard (polystyrene latex, totally opalescent) and with a transmittance standard (silicone oil, totally transparent). The graphs obtained show the percentage of photons transmitted or reflected with respect to the reference standard. The analysis was carried out every minute for 1 hour. To evaluate the results the following equation was used: Wherein λ* was the average photon transport path in the dispersion analyzed. From a physical point if view, the value of λ*(φ,ά) in the dispersion analyzed was evaluated using the following equation: 2d λ*(Φ, d) = [3Φ( 1 - fjQsJ Wherein φ is the particle volume fraction, d is the average particle diameter and g(d) and QS(d)are the parameters given by the MIE equation to the Maxwell equation. The data obtained were processed by means of the acquired data conversion software Easy soft and a Turbiscan Lab platform to obtain the kinetic stability profile of the sample as a function of the analysis timing. Example 5: Drug Release from the Polylactic Acid Nanoparticles The antimony release was evaluated following the dialysis method using Spectra/Por cellulose acetate dialysis tubings having a molecular cut-off of 12,000-14,000 daltons (Spectrum Laboratories Inc., The Netherlands) sealed at the ends with clips (Paolino et al., 2008). The samples were, then, analyzed with the ICP-MS technique using the analytical procedures described above. The percentage of drug release was calculated using the following equation: Release (%) = SbnT/Sbcar χ 100 wherein Sbrii is the drug amount released at time t and Shear is the amount of drug encapsulated into the particles. The release studies were carried in triplicate. Example 6: Cell Cultures JTT4A.1 cells (murine macrophage cell line) were cultivated in culture plates (100 mmx20 mm) in an incubator at 37°C (5% CO2) using DMEM culture medium with glutamate, penicillin (100 Ul/ml), streptomycin (100 μg ml) and FBS (10% v/v). The medium was changed every 48 hours. When the cells were 80% confluent, they were treated with 2 ml trypsin, scraped from the plates and collected in a centrifuge tube containing 4 ml of culture medium. In addition, plates were washed with 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) to remove the remaining cells, which were transferred to a centrifuge tube. Tubes were centrifuged at 1000 rpm at room temperature for 10 minutes with a Heraeus Sepatech Megafuge 1.0. The cell pellet thus obtained was resuspended in a suitable volume of culture medium and seeded in culture plates before proceeding with the subsequent experiments. Example 7: Cytotoxic Activity Evaluation The cytotoxic effects of the nanocapsules that do not contain the drug were evaluated by MTT test, or cell viability test, at different polymer concentration (from 0,01 to 100 uM) as previously described (Cosco et al., 2011). Briefly, the cultured cells were seeded into 96 well plates at a density of 5xl03 cells/0.2 ml and treated with the formulations to be examined for incubation times of 24, 48 e 72 hours. After each incubation time, a solution of tetrazolium salts was used to evaluate cell viability by means of their mitochondrial activity on said salts, with formation of intracellular blue-purple formazan crystals. In this assay, cell vitality and mitochondrial activity are directly proportional to the formation and concentration of formazan in the culture plate wells. The results, shown in Figure 6, are the average of four different experiments ± standard deviation. Example 8: Evaluation of the Interaction of Polylactic Acid Nanocapsules with J774A.1 cells The interaction level between nanocapsules made of polylactic acid and murine immortalized murine monocytes, as a function of time, was evaluated according to what previously reported (Cosco et al., 2012). Briefly, a 100 μΐ volume of formulation, containing the radioactively labeled nanosystems using tritiated cholesterol (0.003% w/w corresponding to 3 nmol [3H]CHE), were incubated with J771A.1 cells previously seeded in 6 wells cell culture plates (5xl05cell/ml), and then analyzed by means of a suitable liquid scintillation counter (LSC). The interaction between the treated cells and the polylactic acid nanoparticles was evaluated by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The monocytes were seeded (4 x 104 cells/ml) in 6 well plates where had been previously placed sterile microscopy glass slides, and incubated for 24 hours before treatment with polylactic acid nanocapsules containing DMPE-rhodamine, a fluorescent probe, to be analyzed at different contact times. After incubation, each well was washed three times with PBS to remove the surplus of particles in the suspension and the cells adhering to the slide were fixed using 1 ml of a 70% v/v ethanol solution. Subsequently, each well was treated with 1 ml of a solution containing Hoechst (1/1000) for 30 minutes, to visualize at the microscope the cellular nuclei, and washed three times with 2 ml PBS. Finally, the plates were stored at the temperature of +4°C for the confocal microscopy analysis. The slides, before the analysis, were placed onto slides using a 70% glycerol solution v/v, removing possible air bubbles, and then fixed with a transparent glue. The analysis was carried out using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2 M) operating at Aexc=560 nm and } =580 nm for the rhodamine probe and nm for the Hoechst probe. To carry out the experimental study, a scanning resolution up to 1024x1024 pixel with a 75mW Ar Kr laser ray, equipped with TRITC/FITC/DAPI. The sample micrographs were acquired by suitable Leica software using direct digital access control knobs for a multi-dimensional acquisition. For the analysis an oil immersion 63 x lens was used. Example 9: Sb Intracellular Uptake Intracellular accumulation studies were done according to the paper published by Cosco et al. 2011. Briefly, J774A.1 cells were seeded in Petri capsules and placed in an incubator for the whole night to allow them to adhere to the growth surface. After 24 hours, cells were treated with Glucantime® or with polylactic acid nanocapsules containing MA at an Sb final concentration of 10 uM. The cells thus treated were washed and the amount of Sb contained in the culture medium was quantified by means of the above mentioned ICP-MS technique. Example 10: Evaluation of the Activity against Leashmaniasis in Amastigotes J774A.1 cells (4 χ 104 cellule/ml) were seeded in 6 well plates and incubated for 24 jours at 37°C in 5% CO2 to allow adhesion. In each well was previously placed a sterile slide. Subsequently, adherent macrophages were infected with L. tropica promastigote in a 10:1 (parasite/cell) ratio, and incubated for 4 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2. Free promastigotes were removed by washing the well with PBS. Glucantime and the polylactic acid nanocapsules containing the drug were tested in infected cells at different Sb doses (50 and 10 μΜ). After 48 hours, slides were fixed with methanol, dyed with 10% Giemsa, and examined using an optical oil immersion microscope. Example 11: Biodistribution 1 month B57 mice, weight 25-30 gr, were used as the animal model for the biodistribution experiments shown in Figures 17, 18 e 19. Polylactic acid nanoparticles without drug, radiolabeled with [3H]CHE (80 pCi each separate formulation) were injected in mice through the tail vein, to evaluate their distribution inside the body (Paolino et al., 2012). B57 mice were also used to study the biodistribution of Sbv contained in Glucantime® and of the nanocapsules formulation, administering to each group one formulation or the other in the tail vein (100 μΐ), and determining the amount of antimony by means of the microwave digestion described above and ICP-MS measures (see "Antimonial Compound Entrapment Efficiency"). In this case, organs were previously weighed (from 0.2 to 0.5 g) in fluoropolymer tubes and digested with7 ml HN03 (65% v/v, Merck) and 1 ml HC1 (34-37%, v/v, Carlo Erba), in the microwave digestion system. Statistical Analysis The ANOVA method was used for the statistical analysis of the different experiments. The Bonferroni t-test was used a posteriori to verify the ANOVA test. A p <0.05 value was considered statistically significant. The values are reported as mean ± standard deviation. Conclusions The experiments described above demonstrate that the vehiculation of antimonial preparations such as, for example, Glucantime®, according to invention, allow to encapsulate very efficiently and in a reliable way therapeutically significant and useful amounts of this type of drug. It was also demonstrated that the nanoparticles of the invention containing MA efficiently interact with macrophages, without damaging them or substantially altering their morphology and functions. In addition, the studies carried out and described above demonstrated that the in vivo use of the nanocapsules of the invention for the vehiculation of drugs containing pentavalent antimony allows to preserve the pharmacological activity of the antimonial active principle, in particulare MA, decreasing its accumulation in the heart and kidney tissues, usually causes of serious and undesired side effects typical of this class of drugs, although it confers, with respect to the non-vehiculated active principle a better plasmatic half-life for the chosen antimonial derivative. The latter is deduced by comparing Figures 18 and 19 that show the histograms corresponding to the drug amounts present in the blood for the free drug and for the vehiculated drug, respectively. The same advantages are evident also with other antimonial compounds, such as, for example, Pentostam®. References Acharya S, Sahoo SK.
