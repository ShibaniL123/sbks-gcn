115.6: 7-methoxy-3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one
35 ml (380 mmol) of trifluoroacetic acid is added at 0Â° C. to a solution containing 83% of 4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidine-1-tert-butyl carboxylate in 300 ml of dichloromethane. After 15 hours, the reaction mixture is concentrated slowly in a rotary evaporator. The residue is coevaporated with toluene, taken up in 250 ml of dichloromethane, and then the mixture is adjusted to pH=10 with 1N aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane, the organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. 12.7 g (96%) of 7-methoxy-3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one is obtained in the form of a beige solid.
