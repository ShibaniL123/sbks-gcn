TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to exercise devices, and in particular, to an exercise device having an inelastic strap that is easily configurable for use in performing a wide variety of exercises. BACKGROUND ART Resistance exercise devices allow a user to exercise by providing a resistance to the movement of a user's arms, legs, or torso. The term "resistance exercise device" as used herein denotes exercise devices where resistance is provided by working one muscle against another, or by working against the weight of the user, and may include elastic bands to provide an increased resistance force. More specifically, resistance exercise devices, as used herein, do not include a significant or additional weight against which the user exercises. The usefulness of these devices depends, in part, on the ease with which a user can perform different types of exercises, the range or number of exercises that can be performed with the device, and the ease with which different users can adjust the device according to their height, weight, strength, and/or physical limitations. In addition, resistance exercise devices are often lightweight and may be portable. Resistance exercise devices having elastic bands typically restrict the motion of a user's arms and/or legs, or the motion between the user and a support structure. Elastic exercise devices can be small, even portable, but have limited usefulness that result from their resistance characteristics, which depend on the length and elasticity of the elastic band. As a result of these characteristics, the elastic bands are useful for a specific length range, thus restricting the diversity of exercises for which it can be used. In addition, it may not be possible for different users to use the same device for the same exercise due to differences in height, weight, or strength between different users. Thus, for an elastic device to be generally useful, such as to provide a complete workout or to allow for different users, a plurality of elastic bands are required that must be easily interchangeable. No known prior art device provides the ease of use necessary to be generally useful across a wide range of exercises. Another limitation of elastic resistance exercise devices is that the resistance is inconsistent and increases with increasing displacement, and also tends to snap back when the user decreases his or her effort. While this resistance response provides for a compact design, it is problematic as it does not recreate the resistance encountered by muscles during more natural types of exercising, such as running, swimming, etc. Yet another limitation of elastic devices is the inability to support a wide range of weight of the user - typically the devices are adapted to support only the resistance provided by the user's muscles. This creates extreme limitations in the exercises that can be performed by any individual elastic device. For this reason, elastic devices must be used over a limited range of stances, further limiting the user's workout. Another type of resistance exercise device provides an inelastic strap that is attachable to a fixed location such as, for example, a door. These devices may overcome some of the limitations of the elastic devices previously discussed by providing inelastic straps that can be anchored between a door and a door jamb. One of these devices has a fixed length strap attached to a door through a pulley system that allows the user to exercise by moving the arms in opposite directions. Another of these devices has a pair of fixed length straps anchored to a door. Both of these devices are of limited usefulness because of their fixed length and the range of exercises for which they can be used. US 3,608,900 discloses an exercise device having a frictional restrain in the form of a rigid bracket around which a rope is twisted in a helical fashion. US 4,060,240 discloses an exercise device having a frictional restraint in the form of a pulley around which a cord is reeved. US 5,352,172 discloses an exercise device having a frictional restraint in the form of a rigid frame comprising multiple bars, around which a rope is wrapped. There is a need to provide a resistance exercise device that is easily adjustable so that it can provide a complete workout for any user, including adjustments that allow a wide range of stances and exercises, and that provides resistance to the user's motion in a form that is useful for exercising. In addition, there is a need to provide such a device that is adaptable to be easily portable to enable the device to be mounted to different locations for exercising. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION The present invention solves the above-identified problems of known resistance exercise devices by providing an inelastic device according to claim 1, that is easily adjustable over a large range of lengths, and that can provide resistance ranging from nearly zero to the full body weight of the user. In general, the inelastic device includes elongated inelastic members, such as straps, is attachable to a stationary support, and has grips that allow the user's weight to be transferred to the stationary support. The stationary support may be a structure, including but not limited to a pole, railing, door jamb, or a bracket affixed to a wall or other structure, or may be a naturally occurring object, such as a tree. In one embodiment, the inelastic device is easily adjustable over a large range of lengths, and that can provide resistance ranging from nearly zero to the full body weight of the user. The present invention provides for a variety of interchangeable grips of different types and for mounting to different types of stationary supports. In one embodiment, the present invention provides an exercise device having an elongated member with a grip at both ends and an anchor between the grips for attaching to a structure, where the length of the elongated member is adjustable and where the anchor provides for the elongated member to center on the anchor when the grips are pulled. The device therefore allows a user to easily vary the length of the device and to balance according to the forces applied to the grips. In particular, by positioning the grips equidistant to the anchor while pulling on the grips, the device effectively centers the elongated member on the anchor. Thus, for a user that positions her feet equidistant from the anchor and pulls back to support her weight on the device, the lengths of the two arms of the elongated member are distributed equally, thus creating a balanced device. As used herein, the noun "grip" encompasses any device that is interlockable with part of the human body, that is it can be connected in such a way that a person can transfer a force to the grip, preferably a force equal to some or all of the person's weight, and the verb "grip," when used herein, refers to the action of interlocking the device and a body part. When used in an exercise device, a grip is attached to other elements that permit the force to be transferred to another object, including but not limited to a stationary support, a device that can store or release energy, such as an elastic cord or a spring, or another body part. Grips include devices that can be surrounded by a body part, for example flexible loop or a hook, or that a body part can surround, for example an elongated member that can fit within the grasp of the hand. In this context, a member that can be gripped, or is grippable, is one that can surround a body part or can be surrounded by a body part, and has a size and configuration that permits the transfer of forces from the user to the grip. In one embodiment, the present invention provides an exercise device having an elongated member with a grip at both ends and an anchor between the grips for attaching to a stationary support, where the length of the elongated member is adjustable and where the anchor provides for the elongated member to center on the anchor when the grips are pulled. The device therefore allows a user to easily vary the length of the device and to balance according to the forces applied to the grips. In particular, by positioning the grips equidistant to the anchor while pulling on the grips, the device effectively centers the elongated member on the anchor. Thus, for a user that positions her feet equidistant from the anchor and pulls back to support her weight on the device, the lengths of the two arms of the elongated member are distributed equally, thus creating a balanced device. It is one aspect of the present invention to provide an adjustable, inelastic exercise device comprising an elongated member having a pair of ends separated by a length and a mechanism for adjusting the length. The pair of ends includes a first end having a first grip and a second end having a second grip. The device also includes an anchor having a first portion for mounting the device to a stationary support and a second portion to support the elongated member at a position along the length when both of the grips are pulled in a direction away from the anchor. The support and elongated member interact to provide frictional restraint with respect to the anchor as a function of the force applied to each of the pulled grips. Thus in one embodiment, the frictional restraint restrains the elongated member with the grips equidistant from the anchor when the sum of the forces is increased while the user positions each of the grips a distance of one half of the length from the anchor. It is another aspect of the present invention to provide an adjustable, inelastic exercise device comprising an elongated member including at least one strap, a pair of ends separated by a length, and a pair of cam buckles including a first cam buckle adjacent to one of the pair of ends and a second cam buckle adjacent to the other of the pair of ends. The length of the elongated member is adjustable according to the length of strap through the cam buckles. The device also includes an anchor having a first portion for mounting the device to a stationary support and a second portion to support the elongated member at a position along the length when both of the grips are pulled in a direction away from the anchor. The support and elongated member interact to provide frictional restraint with respect to the anchor as a function of the force applied to each of the pulled grips. Thus in one embodiment, the frictional restraint restrains the elongated member with the grips equidistant from the anchor when the sum of the forces is increased while the user positions each of the grips a distance of one half of the length from the anchor. It is yet another aspect of the present invention to provide an adjustable, inelastic exercise device comprising an elongated member having a pair of ends separated by a length and a mechanism for adjusting the length. The pair of ends includes a first end having a first grip and a second end having a second grip. The device also includes an anchor having a first portion for mounting the device to a stationary support and a second portion to support the elongated member at a position along the length when both of the grips are pulled in a direction away from the anchor. The support and elongated member interact to provide frictional restraint with respect to the anchor as a function of the force applied to each of the pulled grips. Thus in one embodiment, the frictional restraint restrains the elongated member with the grips equidistant from the anchor when the sum of the forces is increased while the user positions each of the grips a distance of one half of the length from the anchor. It is one aspect of the present invention to provide a portable exercise apparatus comprising a resistance exercise device with at least one integral grip that is removably coupled to an accessory grip. The accessory grip allows the exercise device to be used for a greater range of exercises and allows for additional muscles to be exercised. In one embodiment, the integral grips are rigid elongated members, such a tube, having an outer circumference, and the accessory grip has a grip attachment portion including at least one strap having a length greater than the outer circumference and includes a fastener to secure the grip attachment portion about the integral grip. In one embodiment, the accessory grip includes a loop adapted for accepting a heel of a user. In a second embodiment, the accessory grip includes one or more loops each adapted for accepting at least one finger of a user. In a third embodiment, the accessory grip includes a plurality of cords adapted for gripping, in any combination, by a hand of a user. In yet another embodiment, a bracket is provided to support the exercise device to a wall. It is yet another aspect of the present invention to provide an accessory for attaching to an integral grip of a resistance exercise device comprising an accessory grip coupled to an attachment portion that is removably attachable to the integral grip, such that the exercise apparatus provides resistance through the accessory grip. In one embodiment, the integral grip is a rigid elongated member having an outer circumference, and the attachment portion includes at least one strap having a length greater than the outer circumference of the rigid elongated member and includes a fastener to secure the strap about the rigid elongated member. It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a grip for an exercise device comprising a plurality of cords each having a grip portion with a length greater than 4 inches (0.1 m) and a diameter of from 1/4 inch (6 mm) to approximately 1 inch (25 mm), and a joint mutually connecting the plurality of cords and connected to the exercise device. The plurality of cords are sufficiently flexible to adjacently arrange two or more of the grip portions of the plurality of cords, such that a user can grip two or more of the grip portions. In one embodiment the cord ends not attached to the joint are themselves joined. It is one aspect of the present invention to provide a device for anchoring an exercise device to a wall, where the exercise device includes a pair of grips and an anchor having a strap with an enlarged end. The device includes a bracket having a first portion to affix to the wall and a second portion having an opening and spaced apart from an affixed wall. The opening is adapted to accept the strap of the anchor, the spacing between the second portion and an affixed wall is sufficient to accept the enlarged portion between the accepted strap and the affixed stationary support, and the opening is sufficiently small to prevent the enlarged portion from passing through the opening. The exercise device is thus removably supportable by the opening of the bracket. One aspect of the present invention is to provide a substantially inelastic exercise device that can be anchored to a structure and that has an adjustable length that is self-centering about an anchor point upon pulling by the user. Another aspect of the present invention is to provide an exercise device that can be anchored to a stationary support and exert a substantially inelastic resistance to the motion of a user through a pair of arms, each with a grip, having an adjustable length that centers about the anchor when pulled by the user. It is another aspect of the present invention to provide an adjustable and essentially self-centering exercise device that can support up to the full weight of the user. It is yet another aspect of the present invention to provide a portable exercise device that can be easily attachable to a stationary support and that can provide a complete workout of user determined intensity, resistance, and effort.

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION In general, the present invention provides an inelastic exercise device that is supported by, or that can be easily attached to, a supporting structure, and that allows a user to perform a large number of exercises by easily adjusting the length of the device and thereafter balancing the device as the user transfers his weight to the device. Several of the features of the present invention will now be illustrated with reference to FIGS. 1-3, which show the set-up and use of the device of the present invention, and which is not meant to limit the scope of the present invention. FIG. 1 is a schematic front view of one embodiment of exercise device 100 that is anchored at a point A between a door D and door jamb J. FIG. 2 is a partial sectional view 2-2 of FIG. 1 taken through door D and showing exercise device 100 in profile, and FIG. 3 is illustrative of a user U exercising with the exercise device of FIG. 1. Exercise device 100 includes an anchor 110 and an elongated member 120 having a pair of arms 122, indicated as a first arm 122a and a second arm 122b, on either side of the anchor, as shown schematically in FIGS. 1 and 2. A pair of grips 123 is provided, with one positioned at the end of each arm 122, specifically first arm 122a has a first grip 123a, and second arm 122b has a second grip 123b. Elongated member 120 is substantially inelastic and flexible with a length S between the pair of grips 123, and has a portion 129 that is an inelastic, flexible strap, and a lengthening mechanism 135 that provides for increasing or decreasing the length S, as indicated by double arrows ΔS. Anchor 110 is used to provide a fixed anchor point for exercise device 100 and to support a user's weight as it is applied to arms 122 as indicated by an arrow F in FIG. 2 and as shown in FIG. 3. As shown in FIG. 2, anchor 110 is adapted for positioning exercise device 100 in a door and providing support to elongated member 120 by having an enlarged portion 111, a portion 113 that can be strap or cord, and an approximately triangular shaped loop 115 for slidably supporting the elongated member. With enlarged portion 111 on the opposite side of door D from elongated member 120, anchor 110 supports the weight of a user as grips 123 are pulled. In addition, anchor 110 provides for positioning the relative length of arms 122 as shown in FIG. 1 by double arrow C. Thus, the total length of elongated member 120 and distribution of that length between each of arms 122 can be easily adjusted through the lengthening mechanism 135 and by pulling the ends of the elongated member. FIG. 2 shows arms 122 each having a length L. When supported by a structure, such as door D (shown in FIGS. 1-3) or a railing, pole or other support member (not shown) the inventive exercise device provides a pair of grips for a user to exercise against her weight according the user's position relative to the device, and provides for easily adjusting the length of the device. As described below, the inventive device can be used to exercise in any one of a large number of orientations according the selected adjustable length and according to where and how the user stands relative to the exercise device. In general, a user sets the exercise device to a desired length, positions herself on the ground near the exercise device, supports a portion of her body weight from the exercise device by her hands or feet, and exercised by moving her body with her weight supported by the ground and the exercise device. Examples of support on the ground and exercise device include, but are not limited to, standing on one or both legs, lying on the stomach or the back, kneeling, or by having the hands on the ground, and having the exercise device support ones weight by the hands or feet, as appropriate. With reference to FIG. 3, a user U is shown in one of the many exercise positions, in particular a high row exercise, gripping the pair of grips 123 with the user's hands and having the user's feet placed a horizontal distance X from anchor point A. When anchored to a door, it is preferred that anchor point A is on the inwards side of the door (that is, that the door open away from user U) so that jamb J can support the user's weight. The user U is shown leaning away from anchor point A and supporting a fraction of his or her weight through device 100. It is apparent that user U can vary the amount of supported weight, and thus the resistance of exercise device 100, by adjustment of his or her stance relative to anchor point A (distance X) and the length of arms 122 (length L). The user U of FIG. 3 performs a high row exercise by moving his body in a direction E towards and away from anchor point A. Note that other exercises are also possible with the user in this position by the user moving in other directions with the user's weight supported by the ground and exercise device 100. Several embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. These embodiments are meant to illustrate the invention, and are not meant to limit the scope of the invention. FIGS. 4-9 are various views of another embodiment of an exercise device 400 of the present invention. Referring first to FIG. 4, a perspective view of exercise device 400 is shown as including an anchor 410 and an elongated member 420. Anchor 410 includes an inelastic, flexible strap 413 having an enlarged first end 411 that is wider than the strap, and a second end that forms a loop 415. Elongated member 420 passes through loop 415, defining a pair of arms 422, indicated as arm 422a and 422b. Each arm 422 has a respective end 421, shown as end 421a and 421b, each with one of a pair of grips 423, shown as grip 423a and 423b. Elongated member 420 also includes a pair of lengthening devices or buckles 435, shown as buckle 435a and 435b, at either end of a central strap 429 that provides for the adjustment of the length of the elongated member. Specifically, strap 429 has a pair of ends 431, indicated as 431a and 431b, that pass through buckle 435a and 435b, respectively. As described subsequently, elongated member 420 is substantially inelastic, with the length of the elongated member being adjustable through the action of one or both of the pair of buckles 435. FIGS. 4, 5A and 5B present several views of anchor 410, where FIG. 5A is a perspective view of the anchor and FIG. 5B is a sectional view 5B-5B of the anchor. As noted previously, anchor 410 includes an inelastic, flexible strap 413. It is preferred that the majority of lengths of anchor 410 and elongated member 420 are formed of materials that include, but are not limited, to straps of a webbing of a natural or synthetic material having a strength sufficient to support the weight of a device user. Preferred webbings include, but are not limited to, webbings made of nylon, polypropylene or other polymeric fibers. It is understood that a single length of flexible material according to the present invention can alternatively comprise two or more pieces that are stitched, glued, or otherwise attached to one another. It is preferred that the length of anchor 410 is from 6 to 18 inches (0.15 - 0.45 m), or more preferably, approximately 12 inches (0.3 m). Strap 413 has an enlarged first end 411 that is wider than the strap, and a second end 417 that is attached to the strap so as to form a loop 415. As shown in FIG. 5B, strap 413 has an end 502 fonning the core of first end 411. Since one of the intended uses of anchor 410 is to anchor exercise device 400 between a door and jamb, it is preferable that the end 411 include materials that are soft enough to prevent damage to a wood door or door fame, yet be sturdy enough to support the weight of a user. One embodiment that is soft yet sturdy is shown in FIG. 5B. Specifically, strap end 502 is partially surrounded by a recessed enclosure 505 and a pillow 507 that covers the strap end and the enclosure. Strap end 502 can further be held within end 411 by gluing and stitching the strap end to enclosure 505 and pillow 507, and by closing the pillow with one or more stitches 509. Strap 413 passes into first end 411 through a slot 504 in enclosure 505 and through slot 501 in pillow 507. In a preferred embodiment, first end 411 is approximately 3.5 inches (90 mm) by 2.5 inches (63 mm) and is oriented approximately perpendicular to strap 413. It is also preferred that enclosure 505 is formed of a high-density, closed cell foam, and that pillow 507 is formed from a felt, and includes stitches 503. Alternatively, a second strap or piece of another material could be sewn, glued or otherwise attached to the end of strap 413 to form end 502. In another alternative embodiment, enclosure 505 can include another rigid member, such as a metal or hard plastic plate, to increase the rigidity of strap end 411. Elongated member 420 is shown in greater detail in FIGS. 6-9, where FIG. 6 is a schematic top view of the elongated member, FIG. 7 is a perspective view of one of the pair of grips 421 and the corresponding one of the pair of buckles 435, FIG. 8 is a sectional view 8-8 of one of the pair of grips 421, and FIG. 9A is a perspective view showing details of one of the pair of buckles and the adjoining strap 429. As shown in FIG. 6, the elongated member 420 has length S, and includes two inelastic strap portions 427, indicated as 427a and 427b, strap 429 and the pair of buckles 435 for adjusting the length S. The portion of elongated member 420 from each end to the nearest buckle has a fixed length - that is, each of the two portions from one of the pair of ends 421 to the corresponding one of the pair of buckles 435 has a fixed length. It is preferred that the length S is adjustable over a length that allows for a wide range of exercises. Preferably, length S can be varied in length from approximately 6 feet (1.8 m) to 12 feet (3.6 m). Also preferably, elongated member 420 has a width of approximately 1.5 inches (38 mm). It is also preferred that the surface finish of strap 429 and loop 415 allows the user to easily slide the elongated member 420 along anchor 420, while providing enough friction so that there can be some mismatch in forces on the two ends 421 without the elongated member sliding through the anchor while a user is exercising. The details of one of the pair of ends 421, including strap 429 to grip 423, and including buckle 435 are shown in FIGS. 7, 9A and 9B. Buckle 435 is a cam buckle, the design and use of which are well known in the art. Buckle 435 is attached to strap 427, and thus the length of each of end 421 is not adjustable. Buckle 435 is also slidably accepts and grips strap 429, allowing for adjustment of the length S. Buckle 435 has a frame 709, a first strap bar 705, a second strap bar 707, and a user movable cam 711. Strap 427 has one end that loops about first strap bar 705, and a second, free end 431 that loops about second strap bar 707. This loop of strap 427 about bar 705 is preferably secured by stitches 703. Alternatively, strap 427 can be secured to bar 705 through a second member, such as another looped strap or a plastic or metal piece that loops about bar 705 and provides a location to attach strap 427. In addition, it is understood that the use of stitches as described herein to fasten strap portions can also be accomplished through the use of other methods of fastening, such as glue or by melting strap portions together. Cam 711 is spring loaded such that it normally restrains a strap 429, and that under the action of a user, such as by pushing or pulling the cam, the cam is moved to allow the strap to move. The distance between cam 711 and bar 707 is adjusted by the user and a spring within buckle 435 by pushing on cam 711, allowing strap 429 to slide between cam 711 and bar 707. Thus, the length S can be adjusted by the user actuating cam 711 of buckle 435. Grip 423 is shown in greater detail in the sectional view of FIG. 8. Grip 423 has a generally tubular shape, with an outer cover 801 and an inner cylindrical tubular portion 803. Cover 801 has a length and outer diameter to allow a hand to easily grab grip 423, and is formed from a material that permits a user to hold it while exercising. A preferred material for cover 801 is a high-density foam. Portion 803 provides the strength of grip 423 and can be formed from a length and diameter of plastic or other rigid material to match the size of cover 801 and to provide space for a loop 425 to pass through the center of portion 803. Portion 803 is preferably formed from a rigid and light material, such as PVC tubing. One of the pair of free ends 431 is shown in greater detail in FIG. 9A. Each end 431 is preferably folded back, and is held in place, for example by a stitch 901, to form an easily manipulated end. Elongated member 420 also includes several sleeves, shown as sleeves 903, 905a and 905b that twice surrounds strap 429 to prevent ends 431 from moving about. Specifically, sleeves 903 and 905 are placed between buckles 435, ends 431 and strap 429. Thus sleeves 903 and 905 restrain the portion of strap 429 from a buckle 435 to the corresponding end 431 from moving about as exercise device 420 is moved. As shown in FIG. 9A, sleeve 903 is affixed near end 431, while sleeves 905 can be slid along the length of strap 429. FIG. 9B is a sectional view 9B-9B of FIG. 9A showing details of the cam buckle and attachment of sleeve 905b. In particular, FIG. 9B shows a bar 907 that spans buckle 435 and a strap 909 that is attached both the bar and to sleeve 905b. Strap 909 keeps sleeve 905b from sliding too far down strap 429 during adjustment of the length of the exercise device. It is preferred that sleeves 905b are elastic so that they can easily move and hold together the portions of strap 429. While exercise device 400 has been described with respect to a particular embodiment, there are many alternative embodiments that are within the scope of the present invention. Thus, for example, there are many embodiments that provide for an adjustable length, substantially inelastic, strap-like member that has an easily adjustable length and balance of the two sides of the strap-like member about the anchor. One alternative embodiment is shown in FIGS. 10 and 11, where FIG. 10 is a schematic top view of an alternative elongated member 320 having one cam buckle 425 as a lengthening device, and two finger grips 1001, and FIG. 11 is a sectional view of alternative finger grips. The use of one buckle 435 provides a lighter exercise device 400, but results in a smaller useful range of lengths for elongated member 1020. Finger grips 4001 include four holes 4101 for the user's fingers, and allows for exercise of one or more finger muscles. Modified finger grips can alternatively be provided as an "add-on" modification to elongated member 420, allowing the user to switch between finger and hand grips. A variety of other add-on grip accessories, not shown, can be used with exercise device 400, including but not limited to a cord grip for forearm development, a heel cup accessory for securing the feet to the handles for leg development exercises. The balancing and lengthening aspects of the present invention are illustrated in FIGS. 12A-12D, where FIG. 12A is an initial configuration, FIG. 12B illustrates lengthening the elongated member 420, further illustrated in FIGS. 12B' and 12B", FIG. 12C shows the application of force to the shorter leg of the elongated member, and FIG. 12D shows the application of force to the grips during an exercise. For illustrative purposes, FIG. 12A is assumed to be an initial configuration of an anchored device, and it is assumed that the user wishes to increase the length S while keeping the pair of arms 422 the same length (approximately one half of S). First, the user actuates one or both buckles 435. FIG. 12B schematically shows the result of actuating buckle 435a and elongating leg 422a as indicated by the arrows on that figure. FIG. 12B' shows the user U pushing cam 711 and grabbing end 431, and FIG. 12B" shows the user pulling end 431 away from the cam, as indicated by the arrow, to shorten the device. The user then preferentially pulls on the shorter leg 422b as indicated by force vector F1 of FIG. 12C. With both of the pair of legs 422 having approximately the same, longer length the user can then exercise, as indicated in FIG. 12D, by applying equal forces F2 to each handle grip. In practice, it is not necessary for the two forces of FIG. 12D to be equal, as the application of force to legs 422 away from anchor 410 increases the friction between elongated member 420 and the anchor, allowing the lengths to not change, even under some mismatch of applied forces. Alternatively, exercise device can be adjusted to provide shorter legs 422 by pulling on end 431 to shorten the length S. In addition to being equally balanced between the two arms, it is possible to user the inventive device to provide differing arm lengths for exercising. FIGS. 13A-13C illustrate the lengthening and adjusting of exercise device 400 having differing lengths of arms 422, where FIG. 13A is an initial configuration, FIG. 13B shows the application of force to one of the pair of ax-ms 422, and FIG. 13C shows the application of force to the grips during an exercise. For illustrate purposes, FIG. 13A is assumed to be an initial configuration of an anchored device, and it assumed that the user wishes to adjust the length of arms 422 to different lengths. First, the user preferentially pulls on the shorter leg 422b as indicated by force vector F1 of FIG. 13B. The user can then exercise, as indicated by the equal forces F2 of FIG. 13C. In practice, it is not necessary for the two forces of FIG. 13C to be equal, since as illustrated in FIG. 12, as the application of force to legs 422 away from anchor 410 increases the friction between elongated member 420 and the anchor also increases. This limits the possibility that the arm lengths will change, even under some mismatch of applied forces. The adjustment of arms 422 to different lengths can be combined with the lengthening or shortening of the length S by actuating one or both of buckles 435. Various mechanisms for providing a fixed anchor point are within the scope of the present invention. Thus, it is within the scope of the present invention to provide an exercise device that can be anchored in a door, about a pole, railing or stanchion, from a hook installed in a wall, or can be permanently affixed to a wall or exercise structure, for example. FIG. 14A is an alternate embodiment anchor 1400 that can be used for attaching the exercise device to a pole or railing, and FIG. 14B is an exercise device of the present invention anchored to a pole using the alternative anchoring embodiment of FIG. 14A. FIG. 14A shows alternative embodiment anchor 1410 which includes an adjustable loop 1419 and an anchor loop 1415. As described subsequently, anchor 1410 is an alternative anchor, and can, for example, presents anchor loop 1415 for accepting strap 429 of elongate member 420 to form an exercise 1400. Adjustable loop 1419 is formed from a flexible strap 1411 and a cam buckle 1412 as follows. Cam buckle 1412 can be, for example, cam buckle 435 shown in detail in FIG. 9B. Flexible strap 1411 has a free, first end 1414 that is threaded through the cam portion of cam buckle 1412, for example by threading the strap between the second strap bar 707 and movable cam 711 of cam buckle 435. Flexible strap also has a second end 1418 that is attached to cam buckle 1412, for example, by looping the second end about first strap bar 705 of cam buckle 435 and providing a stitching 1416 through a double thickness of strap 1411. Strap 1411 thus threaded through buckle 1412 has forms an adjustable loop 1419 that can be increased or decreased in size by actuating cam buckle 1412 to release strap 1411, moving the strap through the cam buckle, and releasing the cam. End 1414 is held against strap 1411 by a slack sleeve 1413. An anchor loop 1415 is attached to strap 1411 by a stitching 1417. It is preferred that the majority of lengths of anchor 1as10 are formed of materials that include, but are not limited, to straps of a webbing of a natural or synthetic material having a strength sufficient to support the weight of a device user. Preferred webbings include, but are not limited to, webbings made of nylon, polypropylene or other polymeric fibers. It is understood that a single length of flexible material according to the present invention can alternatively comprise two or more pieces that are stitched, glued, or otherwise attached to one another. FIG. 14B shows exercise device 1400 formed from anchor 1410 and elongated member 420. Anchor loop 1413 of anchor 1410 is tightened about a pole P. Adjustable loop 1411 may be placed over the top of the pole and tightened using cam buckle 1412. Alternatively, strap 1411 can unthreaded from cam buckle 1412, wrapped about pole P, and then threaded through the cam buckle and tightened. In either case, end 1414 is the pulled through cam buckle 1412 and adjustable loop 1419 is tightened about pole P with sufficient force to allow exercise device 1400 to support a users weight. In addition to being attached to a pole, anchor 1410 can be tensioned to support exercise device 1400 about a railing, post, or other member. Alternately, the anchor can be attached to a carbineer that is fixed to a wall or other structure. FIG. 23 shows an anchor 2300 including a flexible strap 2301 with a first end 2305 having a loop 2307 held in place with stitching 2311 and a second end 2303 having a carabineer 2304 held in place by stitching 2309, and FIG. 24 illustrates the use of anchor 2300 to anchor the elongated member 120 of the exercise device to a tree. It is preferred that the majority of lengths of strap 2301 are formed of materials that include, but are not limited, to straps of a webbing of a natural or synthetic material having a strength sufficient to support the weight of a device user. Preferred webbings include, but are not limited to, webbings made of nylon, polypropylene or other polymeric fibers. FIG. 24 shows an exercise device 2400 formed from anchor 2300 and elongated member 420. Strap 2301 is be wrapped about a tree with carabineer 2304 accepting the strap. Loop 2307 accepts strap 429, allowing the user to exercise against a tree or other object small enough for strap 2301 to be wrapped about. FIGS. 25 and 26 shows a bracket 2500 for securing exercise device 400 by enlarged first end 411 of anchor 410, where FIG. 25 is a perspective front view of the bracket, and FIG. 26 illustrates the use of the bracket to anchor the exercise device. Bracket 2500 has a first flange 2503 with a mounting hole 2509 and a second flange 2505 with a mounting hole 2511 and a face 2507 that extends from the first flange to the second flange and includes a slot 2515 that extends into the face a face edge 2513 and includes a central slot 2517. In a preferred embodiment, bracket 2500 is formed from a single sheet 2501 of sheet metal, for example that has crease 2517 in flange 2503, crease 2523 in flange 2505, and creases 2519 and 2521 between face 2507 and flanges 2503 and 2505, respectively. The preferred thickness of sheet 2501 is from 0.05 to 0.10 inches (1.3 to 2.5 mm), or more preferably approximately 0.0625 inches (1.6 mm), and creases 2517, 2519, 2521, and 2523 are placed to such that face 2507 is parallel to and separated from flanges 2503 and 2505 by a distance D of from approximately 1 to 2 inches (25 - 51 mm), or more preferably approximately 1.5 inches (38 mm). Mounting holes 2509 and 2511 are preferably between approximately 1/4 inch (6 mm) and approximately 1/2 inch (13 mm) in diameter, and more preferably approximately 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) in diameter. FIG. 26 illustrates the use of bracket 2500. Bracket 2500 is mounted to a wall W, and held in place by a pair of screws 2601 through mounting holes 2509 and 2511. A portion of anchor 410 is shown in phantom on the right side of FIG. 26, specifically enlarged portion 411 and flexible strap 413. Anchor 410 is placed in bracket 2500 as indicated by the arrow. Specifically, strap 413 is slid through the slot 2515 in face edge 2513, with enlarged portion between bracket 2500 and wall W and into central slot 2517. Slot 2515 is sized to be large enough to allow strap 413 to slide through the slot but not so large as to allow enlarged portion 411 to pass through the slot. The use of bracket 2500 allows for exercise device 400, which was previously shown as being mountable in a door jamb, to be mounted against any wall to which the bracket can be mounted. The inventive exercise device allows for a wide range of exercises. Examples of the many exercises that are possible are presented in TABLE 1 for the inventive device placed over the top of a door. FIGS. 3 and 15 illustrate three of the many exercise positions. In each of these positions the user has selected a length for exercise device 100 or 400, adjusted as explained with reference to FIGS. 12 or 13, has positioned himself on the ground a desired horizontal distance X from anchor point A with a portion of his weight being supported by the exercise device. With his weight so supported, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 15, he moves his body in directions appropriate to the type of exercise to be performed, for example by moving his body toward or away from the wall or ground, by bending his arms or legs while supporting his weight by the exercise device, or performing other movements that exercise his muscles. Specifically illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 15 are single poses of a user U performing a variety of exercises including a high row exercise (FIG. 3), a reverse combination crunch (FIG. 15A), a single leg L-squat (FIG. 15B), a gymnast dip (FIG. 15C), a kneeling combination crunch (FIG. 15D), a lying leg curl (FIG. 15E), a hip lift (FIG. 15F), a front shoulder raise (FIG. 15G), a crunch (FIG. 15H), and a triceps extension (FIG. 15I). It is apparent from FIGS. 3 and 15 that many different types of exercises are possible with the inventive exercise device according to the length of the device, the positioning of the body, and how the handles are gripped. In addition, the inventive device can be used to perform one handed exercises as illustrated in FIGS. 16A and 16B. Specifically, FIG. 16A shows an exercise device 400' having interlocking the ends 421a and 421b for one handed exercises, and FIG. 16B illustrates the use of the exercise device 400' in performing a one arm high row exercise.

In general, the grip accessories described herein are attachable to one of the pair of grips that are part of an exercise device, including but not limited to grips 123 of exercise device 100, and provide an accessory grip whereby the user can exercise by applying forces to various part of the body, including the neck, all or part of the hand, arms, legs, toes, or the heel. Grip accessories allow the user to grip, such as by squeezing with sufficient force to support her weight, and include devices that can hold the user within a loop or hook as the user pulls on the exercise device. In this context, a "grippable" portion refers to the ability to either wrap a body part around and squeeze a that portion of the grip accessory, or place a portion of the body through a loop or hook of the grip accessory so that the user can pull against the exercise device and keep the body part within the grip accessory. The user may choose to exercise with the pair of grips having the same or different accessories, or without a grip accessory. In addition, the grip accessories of the present invention include a grip attachment portion that is removably attachable to the grip of an exercise device, such as exercise device 100 or any exercise device having two grips, and a portion that is grippable by the hand, foot, fingers, or other parts of the body. The use of grip accessories allow a user to build additional strength in the hand or fingers by providing for different types of hand or finger gripping, and allows for additional exercises to be performed, as with the foot grip accessory. In addition, the pair of grips can be coupled, as discussed in reference to FIGS. 16A and 16B, allowing a user to exercises using one grip accessory. One example of a grip accessory is foot grip accessory 1700, which is illustrated in FIGS. 17A-17B as being attached to grips 123 of exercise device 100. Specifically, FIG. 17A illustrates foot grip accessory 1700 attached to exercise device 100 and gripped by toes T, and FIG. 17B illustrates a pair of foot grip accessories, one on each of the pair of grips 123, and each grasped by one of the user's heel H1 and H2. Each foot grip accessory 1700 has a flexible loop 1710 and a grip attachment portion 1720 that is removably attachable, as discussed subsequently, to one of the pair of grips 123. It is preferred that the portion of loop 1710 that extends from grip 123 is approximately 12 inches (0.3 m) long to provide enough room for either a user's heel or toe fit through the loop. With foot grip accessory 1700 so secured, the toes (FIG. 17A) or heel (FIG. 17B) can be placed through loop 1710, and a force can be exerted by the foot against exercise device 100. In one embodiment of the present invention, each of the pair of grips 123 is provided with one foot grip accessory 1700, facilitating exercises including, but not limited, to those illustrated in FIGS. 15A and E. A specific embodiment of foot grip accessory 1700 is illustrated in FIGS. 18A-D, where FIG. 18A is a perspective view of the foot grip accessory, FIG. 18B is a bottom view of the foot grip accessory, FIG. 18C is a side view of part of one of the grip attachment portions, and FIG. 18D is a top view of part of one of the grip accessory attachment portions. As shown in FIGS. 18A and 18B, foot grip 1700 is formed from three straps: a loop strap 1801 and two attachnent straps 1803. With the three straps attached, as described subsequently, loop strap 1801 forms loop 1710 and the two attachment straps 1803 forms the grip attachment portion 1720. It is preferred that the majority of foot grip accessory 1700 is formed of materials that include, but are not limited, to straps of a webbing of a natural or synthetic material having a strength sufficient to support the weight of a device user. Preferred webbings include, but are not limited to, polymeric fiber webbings made of, for example, nylon or polypropylene or some other polymeric fiber. It is understood that a single length of flexible material according to the present invention can alternatively comprise two or more pieces that are stitched, glued, or otherwise attached to one another. Loop strap 1801 is formed from a length of strapping having ends that are joined to form a loop. Loop strap 1801 is preferably polymeric fiber webbing 20 inches (0.5 m) long and 1.5 inches (38 mm) wide. In the preferred embodiment, the loop includes two triangular shaped double stitched portions 1815, one of which joins the two ends of loop strap 1801. Each of the two grip attachment straps 1803 is formed from a length of strapping having a first end 1807 with a first fastening surface 1809 and a second end 1811 with a second fastening surface 1813. Attachment straps 1803 are preferably polymeric fiber webbing having a length of 7.5 inches (190 mm) and a width of 1.5 inches (38 mm). Fastening surfaces 1809 and 1811 are preferably attached to loop strap 1801 by double stitching 1817, and grip attachment straps 1803 are preferably joined midway between ends 1807 and 1811 to the loop strap by double stitching 1805. Each attachment strap 1803 includes fastening surfaces 1809 and 1813 are on opposite sides of the strap. It is preferred that fastening surfaces 1809 and 1813 are matching surfaces, such as matching hook and loop surfaces of a hook and loop fastening system, such as VELCRO® brand hook and loop fasteners. In a preferred embodiment, fastening surfaces 1809 and 1813 are each approximately 2 inches (51 mm) by 1.25 inches (32 mm). Foot grip accessory 1700 is removably attachable and is used as follows. Grip attachment portion 1720 of foot grip accessory 1700 is removably attachable to one of the pair of grips 123, by wrapping the length of each strap 1703 about grip 123a and contacting fastening surfaces 1809 and 1813 on each strap 1803. With foot grip accessory 1700 so secured, the toes (FIG. 18A) or heel (FIG. 18B) can be placed through loop 1710, and a force can be exerted by the foot against exercise device 100. Stitching 1815 allows loop 1710 to open without twisting and provides a secure strap for securing the foot. Another example of a grip accessory is finger grip accessory 1900, which is illustrated in FIGS. 19A-19C with three different exercises when attached to grips 123 of exercise device 100. Finger grip assembly 1900 has loops 1910 adapted for receiving and being gripped by the thumb and one or more fingers and a grip attaclunent portion 1920 for attaching the accessory to the grip of an exercise device. Grip attachment portion 1920 is removably attachable to one of the pair of grips 123. In one embodiment, there are two loops 1910: a first loop 1910a, and a second loop 1910b. With finger grip accessory 1900 so secured, a finger F1 can be placed through one of the loops, for example first loop 1910a as shown in FIG. 19A, a finger F1 can be placed through the first loop and a finger F2 can be placed through second loop 1910b as shown in FIG. 19B, or two fingers, F1 and F2 can be placed through the first loop and a finger F3 and a finger F4 can be placed through the second loop, as shown in FIG. 19C. In one embodiment, each of the pair of grips 123 is provided with one finger grip accessory 1900. With the finger or fingers so placed through at least one of loops 1910, a force can be exerted by the pulling against exercise device 100. Finger grip accessory 1900 has similar functionality as finger grips 4001. A specific embodiment of finger grip accessory 1900 is illustrated in FIGS. 20A-C, where FIG. 20A is a perspective view of the finger grip accessory, FIG. 20B is a top view 20B-20B of the finger grip accessory, and FIG. 20C is a sectional side view 20C-20C of the finger grip accessory. Finger grip accessory 1900 includes two loops 1910, first loop 1910a and second loop 1910b, and grip attachment portion 1920 includes three portions 1920a, 1920b, and 1920c. More specifically, finger grip accessory 1900 is formed from five straps: a loop strap 2001, three attachment straps 1803, and a backing strap 1903. With the five straps attached, as described subsequently, loop strap 2001 forms first loop 1910a and finger loop 1910b, that can each receive one or more fingers, and each of the three attachment straps 1803 forms one of grip attachment portion 1920a, 1920b, and 1920c. It is preferred that the majority of finger grip 1900 is formed of the same materials as hand grip 1700. In a preferred embodiment, loop strap 2001 is constructed from a polymeric fiber webbing having a length of 21.5 inches (0.55 m) long and a width of 1 inch (25 mm), and backing strip 2003 is preferably a polymeric fiber webbing having a length of 2 inches (51 mm) and a width of 1 inch (25 mm). Preferred attachment straps 1803 have been discussed previously. Finger grip accessory 1900 is assembled by three stitches 2007 that each pass through one of the three attachment straps 1803 and through loop strap 2001 and backing strap 2003. In the preferred embodiment, stitching 2007 is double stitched portions. As is shown in FIGS. 20A and 20C, a portion of loop strap 2001 protrudes between each of the three attachment straps 1803 to form loops 1910a and 1910b. It is preferred that loops 1910a and 1910b are formed from lengths of loop strap 1901 that are approximately 8 inches (0.2 m). Loop strap 2001 preferably extends the length of backing strap 2003, with two loops 1910a and 1910b between adjacent attachment straps 1803. Finger grip accessory 1900 is removably attachable and is used as follows. Grip attachment portion 1920 of finger grip accessory 1900 is removably attachable to one of the pair of grips 123 by the contact of fastening surfaces 1809 and 1813 on each strap 1803. With finger grip accessory 1900 so secured, a finger may be placed through one of the loops, for example loop 1910a as shown in FIG. 20A, one finger can be placed through each of loop 1910a and 1910b as shown in FIG. 20B, or two fingers can be placed through each of loop 1910a and 1910b as shown in FIG. 20C. With the finger or fingers so placed through at least one of loops 1910, a force can be exerted by the user against exercise device 100. A third example of a grip accessory is grip accessory 2100, which is illustrated in FIGS. 21A-21C as being attached to grips 123 of exercise device 100. Grip accessory 2100 has several cords 2110 that can be gripped in different combinations, as explained subsequently, and a grip attachment portion 2120. In general, the number of cords 2110 can be from one to five, or more, with four being a preferred number, and with each cord having the same diameter and length. It is also preferred that the cords have a grippable length large enough for a human hand, for example a length from 4 inches (0.1 m) to 6 inches (0.15 m), and that there is enough additional length to allow the user to pass her hand between cords, as illustrated in FIGS. 21A-21C. The present invention is illustrated by grip accessory 2100 having four cords, denoted as a first cord 2110a, a second cord 2110b, a third cord 2110c, and a fourth cord 2110d. The cords can be gripped in almost any combination so that a user can grip any number of cords, from one cord to all 4 cords. FIG. 21A illustrates hand H gripping three cords, for example the first cord 2110a, second cord 2110b, and third cord 2110c, FIG. 22B illustrates the hand gripping two cords, for example the first and second cords, and FIG. 22C illustrates the hand gripping one cord, for example the first cord. Grip attachment portion 2120 is removably attachable, as discussed subsequently, to one of the pair of grips 123. With grip accessory 2100 so secured, between one and all of cords 2210 can be gripped, and a force can be exerted by pulling against exercise device 100. In one embodiment, each of the pair of grips 123 is provided with one grip accessory 2100. A specific embodiment of grip accessory 2100 is illustrated in FIGS. 22A-D, where FIG. 21A is a perspective view of the grip accessory, FIG. 21B is a top view of the grip accessory, FIG. 21C is a bottom view of the grip accessory, and FIG. 21D is sectional side view 21D-21D of FIG. 21C. Grip accessory 2100 is formed from four straps, specifically a backing strap 2205, a front strap 2207, and two attachment straps 1703, and two cords 2201 and 2203.
