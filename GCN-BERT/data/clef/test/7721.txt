Acetic acid (9.8 ml) and water (4.9 ml) were added to the solution of Compound (4) (0.815 g, 1.30 mmol) in THF (4.9 ml). The mixture was stirred for 3 hrs at 50°C and then cooled to 0°C. 2N-sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added to the mixture until the pH of the mixture became 9. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate for 3 times. The combined organic layer was washed with water and saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and evaporated. Chromatography on a Silica gel column (FL-60D 100 g, 2-propanol : ethyl åcetate = 5:100) of the residue gave colorless oil (0.485 g, 1.17 mmol, 89.9% yield). Further purification with preparative HPLC (YMC-Pak RI-053-15, φ 50 * 250 mm-SIL 120 A, 2-propanol : n-hexane = 18:82, solvent flow = 100 ml/min) gave Compound (5) (0.417 g, 1.12 mmol, 86.3% yield).
