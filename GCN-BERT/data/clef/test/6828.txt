Alternative Routes to Intermediates Used in the Synthesis of Example 17
Preparation of N-[(1R)-2-(3-amino-2-methyl-phenyl)-1-methyl-ethyl]-2,2,2-trifluoro-acetamide
A solution of (R)-3-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methylaniline (0.51 g, 3.13 mmol), DIPEA (0.55 mL, 3.13 mmol), and ethyl 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate (0.47 mL, 3.91 mmol) in MeOH (9.5 mL) was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. DCM and water were added and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (3Ã—50 mL), and the combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4) and filtered. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 100% EtOAc in hexane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-[(1R)-2-(3-amino-2-methyl-phenyl)-1-methyl-ethyl]-2,2,2-trifluoro-acetamide (680 mg, 83%).
