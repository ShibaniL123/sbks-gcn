Step 1: 5-(2-(1,3-Dioxan-2-yl)ethyl)-2-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-8-chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one
To a solution of 2-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-5,8-dichloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one (intermediate 7, 0.2 g, 0.397 mmol) in THF (4 mL) was added (2-(1,3-dioxan-2-yl)ethyl)magnesium bromide (0.5 M in THF, 1.03 mL, 0.516 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h followed by adding another batch of (2-(1,3-dioxan-2-yl)ethyl)magnesium bromide (0.5 M in THF, 1.0 mL, 0.50 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for another 1 h. Water was then added to quench the reaction mixture. THF was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified with silica-gel chromatography (10-40% EtOAc/heptane) to afford the title compound (0.083 g, 36% yield).
