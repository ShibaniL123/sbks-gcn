To a 2 L, 3-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser was added solid manganese dioxide (10 μm mesh, reagent grade, 278 g, 2660 mmol), EtOAc (1.2 L, 0.14 M) and solid (1R,2R)-2-{[5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]amino}-1-methylcyclopentanol (2d, 47.7 g, 177 mmol). The mixture was stirred under nitrogen and heated in a 50° C. oil bath for 4 h. More manganese dioxide (80 g) was added; stirring and heating were continued for another 16 h, until the reaction was complete by LCMS. The solid was removed by filtration, and the flask and filter cake were washed with EtOAc (1 L). The combined filtrates were refiltered to completely remove trace insolubles, and then evaporated to give 4-{[(1R,2R)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]amino}-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde (Intermediate 2, 43.8 g, 93%, 98% ee) as a white solid.
