No. 14/444,335, filed on Jul. 28, 2014, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/881,602, now issued as U.S. Pat.

BACKGROUND Ultrasonic instruments, including both hollow core and solid core instruments, are used for the safe and effective treatment of many medical conditions. Ultrasonic instruments, are advantageous because they may be used to cut and/or coagulate organic tissue using energy in the form of mechanical vibrations transmitted to a surgical end effector at ultrasonic frequencies. Ultrasonic vibrations, when transmitted to organic tissue at suitable energy levels and using a suitable end effector, may be used to cut, dissect, elevate or cauterize tissue or to separate muscle tissue off bone. Such instruments may be used for open procedures or minimally invasive procedures, such as endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures, wherein the end effector is passed through a trocar to reach the surgical site. Activating or exciting the end effector (e.g., cutting blade) of such instruments at ultrasonic frequencies induces longitudinal vibratory movement that generates localized heat within adjacent tissue, facilitating both cutting and coagulation. Because of the nature of ultrasonic instruments, a particular ultrasonically actuated end effector may be designed to perform numerous functions, including, for example, cutting and coagulation. Ultrasonic vibration is induced in the surgical end effector by electrically exciting a transducer, for example. The transducer may be constructed of one or more piezoelectric or magnetostrictive elements in the instrument hand piece. Vibrations generated by the transducer section are transmitted to the surgical end effector via an ultrasonic waveguide extending from the transducer section to the surgical end effector. The waveguides and end effectors are designed to resonate at the same frequency as the transducer. Therefore, when an end effector is attached to a transducer the overall system frequency is the same frequency as the transducer itself. The zero to peak amplitude of the longitudinal ultrasonic vibration at the tip, d, of the end effector behaves as a simple sinusoid at the resonant frequency as given by: [in-line-formulae]d=A sin(ωt)[/in-line-formulae] where: w=the radian frequency which equals 2π times the cyclic frequency, ƒ and A=the zero-to-peak amplitude. The longitudinal excursion is defined as the peak-to-peak (p-t-p) amplitude, which is just twice the amplitude of the sine wave or 2A. Ultrasonic surgical instruments may be divided into two types, single element end effector devices and multiple-element end effector devices. Single element end effector devices include instruments such as scalpels and ball coagulators. Single-element end effector instruments have limited ability to apply blade-to-tissue pressure when the tissue is soft and loosely supported. Sometimes, substantial pressure may be necessary to effectively couple ultrasonic energy to the tissue. This inability to grasp the tissue results in a further inability to fully coapt tissue surfaces while applying ultrasonic energy, leading to less-than-desired hemostasis and tissue joining. In these cases, multiple-element end effectors may be used. Multiple-element end effector devices, such as clamping coagulators, include a mechanism to press tissue against an ultrasonic blade that can overcome these deficiencies. Many surgical procedures utilizing harmonic and non-harmonic instruments create extraneous tissue fragments and other materials at the surgical site. If this material is not removed, it may obstruct the clinician's view and also may interfere with the blade or other end effector of the surgical device. To remove the material, the clinician must remove the instrument from the surgical area and introduce an aspiration tool. This can break the clinician's concentration and also contribute to physical and mental fatigue. Also, in some surgical procedures, it is desirable to remove a core or other integral portion of tissue. In these procedures, the clinician uses a first instrument to grasp and sometimes cut an outline of the tissue to be removed. Then a second instrument is utilized to remove the tissue from surrounding material, often while the tissue is still grasped by the first instrument. This process may be particularly challenging for clinicians because it can require the use of multiple instruments, often simultaneously. Also, many coring procedures are performed at very delicate portions of the anatomy that require precise cuts. In addition, existing harmonic instruments allow the clinician to turn them on or off, but provide limited control over the power delivered to tissue once the instrument is turned on. This limits the usefulness of harmonic instruments in delicate surgical procedures, where fine cutting control is required. SUMMARY In one general aspect, the various embodiments are directed to a surgical device. The surgical device may comprise a transducer configured to provide vibrations along a longitudinal axis and an end effector coupled to the transducer and extending from the transducer along the longitudinal axis. The surgical device also may comprise a lower jaw extending parallel to the end effector. The lower jaw may comprise a clamp face extending toward the longitudinal axis. Also, the lower jaw may be slidable relative to the end effector to bring the clamp face toward a distal end of the end effector. In another general aspect, the various embodiments are directed to another surgical device comprising an end effector. The end effector may comprise a hollow portion defining a central lumen and at least one member extended across at least a portion of the central lumen at about a distal end of the end effector. In yet another general aspect, the various embodiments are directed to a surgical device comprising a central instrument and an outer sheath surrounding the central instrument. The central instrument may be configured to engage tissue, and may be slidable relative to the outer sheath. The outer sheath may comprise a distal edge configured to clamp the tissue when the central instrument is slid to a position proximal from the distal edge of the outer sheath. According to still another general aspect, the various embodiments are directed to a surgical device comprising a transducer configured to energize an end effector and a trigger actuable to cause the end effector to be energized. The end effector may be coupled to the transducer. The surgical device may further comprise a sensor positioned to sense a force exerted on the trigger, and control circuit in communication with the sensor. The control circuit may be configured to increase power delivered to the end effector by the transducer in response to an increase of the force exerted on the trigger.

DESCRIPTION Before explaining the various embodiments in detail, it should be noted that the embodiments are not limited in application or use to the details of construction and arrangement of parts illustrated in the accompanying drawings and description. The illustrative embodiments may be implemented or incorporated in other embodiments, variations and modifications, and may be practiced or carried out in various ways. For example, the surgical instruments and blade configurations disclosed below are illustrative only and not meant to limit the scope or application thereof. Also, the blade and end effector designs described hereinbelow may be used in conjunction with any suitable device. Furthermore, unless otherwise indicated, the terms and expressions employed herein have been chosen for the purpose of describing the illustrative embodiments for the convenience of the reader and are not to limit the scope thereof. Examples of ultrasonic surgical instruments and blades are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,322,055 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,954,736, 6,309,400 B2, 6,278,218B1, 6,283,981 B1, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,325,811 B1, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. These references disclose ultrasonic surgical instrument designs and blade designs where a longitudinal mode of the blade is excited. The result is a longitudinal standing wave within the instrument. Accordingly, the instrument has nodes, where the transverse motion is equal to zero, and anti-nodes, where the transverse motion is at its maximum. The instrument's tissue end effector is often positioned at an anti-node to maximize its longitudinal motion. Various embodiments will now be described to provide an overall understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the devices and methods disclosed herein. One or more examples of these embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the devices and methods specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-limiting embodiments and that the scope of the various embodiments is defined solely by the claims. The features illustrated or described in connection with one embodiment may be combined with the features of other embodiments. Such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the claims. It will be appreciated that the terms “proximal” and “distal” are used herein with reference to a clinician gripping a surgical device at its hand piece assembly, or other comparable piece. Thus, the end effector is distal with respect to the more proximal hand piece assembly. It will be further appreciated that, for convenience and clarity, spatial terms such as “top” and “bottom” also are used herein with respect to the clinician gripping the hand piece assembly, or comparable piece. However, surgical instruments are used in many orientations and positions, and these terms are not intended to be limiting and absolute. FIG. 1 illustrates one embodiment of a surgical system including a surgical instrument and an ultrasonic generator. FIG. 2 illustrates one embodiment of the apparatus shown in FIG. 1. In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1-2, the surgical system 10 includes an ultrasonic clamp coagulator instrument 120 and an ultrasonic generator 30. The surgical instrument 120 includes an ultrasonic drive unit 50. As will be further described, an ultrasonic transducer of the drive unit 50, and an ultrasonic end effector 180 of the clamp instrument 120, together provide an acoustic assembly of the surgical system 10, with the acoustic assembly providing ultrasonic energy for surgical procedures when powered by generator 30. It will be noted that, in some applications, the ultrasonic drive unit 50 is referred to as a “hand piece assembly” because the surgical instrument 120 of the surgical system 10 is configured such that a clinician grasps and manipulates the ultrasonic drive unit 50 during various procedures and operations. The instrument 120 may include a scissors-like grip arrangement which facilitates positioning and manipulation of the instrument 120 apart from manipulation of the ultrasonic drive unit 50. The generator 30 of the surgical system 10 sends an electrical signal through a cable 32 at a selected excursion, frequency, and phase determined by a control system of the generator 30. As will be further described, the signal causes one or more piezoelectric elements of the acoustic assembly of the surgical instrument 120 to expand and contract along a longitudinal axis, thereby converting the electrical energy into mechanical motion. The mechanical motion results in longitudinal waves of ultrasonic energy that propagate through the acoustic assembly in an acoustic standing wave to vibrate the acoustic assembly at a selected frequency and excursion. The end effector 180 is placed in contact with tissue of the patient to transfer the ultrasonic energy to the tissue. For example, a distal portion of blade 180′ of the end effector may be placed in contact with the tissue. As further described below, a surgical tool, such as, a jaw or clamping mechanism, may be utilized to press the tissue against the blade 180′. As the end effector 180 couples with the tissue, thermal energy or heat is generated as a result of friction, acoustic absorption, and viscous losses within the tissue. The heat is sufficient to break protein hydrogen bonds, causing the highly structured protein (e.g., collagen and muscle protein) to denature (e.g., become less organized). As the proteins are denatured, a sticky coagulum forms to seal or coagulate small blood vessels. Deep coagulation of larger blood vessels results when the effect is prolonged. The transfer of the ultrasonic energy to the tissue causes other effects including mechanical tearing, cutting, cavitation, cell disruption, and emulsification. The amount of cutting as well as the degree of coagulation obtained varies with the excursion of the end effector 180, the frequency of vibration, the amount of pressure applied by the user, the sharpness of the end effector 180, and the coupling between the end effector 180 and the tissue. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the generator 30 includes a control system integral with the generator 30, a power switch 34, and a triggering mechanism 36. The power switch 34 controls the electrical power to the generator 30, and when activated by the triggering mechanism 36, the generator 30 provides energy to drive the acoustic assembly of the surgical system 10 frequency and to drive the end effector 180 at a predetermined excursion level. The generator 30 drives or excites the acoustic assembly at any suitable resonant frequency of the acoustic assembly. When the generator 30 is activated via the triggering mechanism 36, electrical energy is continuously applied by the generator 30 to a transducer stack or assembly 40 of the acoustic assembly. A phase-locked loop in the control system of the generator 30 monitors feedback from the acoustic assembly. The phase lock loop adjusts the frequency of the electrical energy sent by the generator 30 to match the resonant frequency of the selected longitudinal mode of vibration of the acoustic assembly. In addition, a second feedback loop in the control system maintains the electrical current supplied to the acoustic assembly at a pre-selected constant level in order to achieve substantially constant excursion at the end effector 180 of the acoustic assembly. The electrical signal supplied to the acoustic assembly will cause the distal end of the end effector 180, e.g., the blade 180′, to vibrate longitudinally in the range of, for example, approximately 20 kHz to 250 kHz. According to various embodiments, the blade 180′ may vibrate in the range of about 54 kHz to 56 kHz, for example, at about 55.5 kHz. In other embodiments, the blade 180′ may vibrate at other frequencies including, for example, about 31 kHz or about 80 kHz. The excursion of the vibrations at the blade can be controlled by, for example, controlling the amplitude of the electrical signal applied to the transducer assembly 40 of the acoustic assembly by the generator 30. As noted above, the triggering mechanism 36 of the generator 30 allows a user to activate the generator 30 so that electrical energy may be continuously supplied to the acoustic assembly. The triggering mechanism 36 may comprise a foot activating switch that is detachably coupled or attached to the generator 30 by a cable or cord. Alternatively, the triggering mechanism can be configured as a hand switch incorporated in the ultrasonic drive unit 50 to allow the generator 30 to be activated by a user. The generator 30 also has a power line 38 for insertion in an electro-surgical unit or conventional electrical outlet. It is contemplated that the generator 30 can also be powered by a direct current (DC) source, such as a battery. The generator 30 can comprise any suitable generator, such as Model No. GEN04, available from Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 3, the ultrasonic drive unit 50 of the surgical instrument includes a multi-piece housing 52 adapted to isolate the operator from the vibrations of the acoustic assembly. The drive unit housing 52 can be shaped to be held by a user in a conventional manner, but it is contemplated that the present clamp coagulator instrument 120 principally be grasped and manipulated by a scissors-like arrangement provided by a housing of the apparatus, as will be described. While the multi-piece housing 52 is illustrated, the housing 52 may comprise a single or unitary component. The housing 52 of the ultrasonic drive unit 50 generally includes a proximal end, a distal end, and a cavity extending longitudinally therein. The distal end of the housing 52 includes an opening 60 configured to allow the acoustic assembly of the surgical system 10 to extend therethrough, and the proximal end of the housing 52 is coupled to the generator 30 by the cable 32. The cable 32 may include ducts or vents 62 to allow air or other fluids to be introduced into the housing 52 of the ultrasonic drive unit 50 to cool the transducer assembly 40 of the acoustic assembly. The housing 52 of the ultrasonic drive unit 50 may be constructed from a durable plastic, such as ULTEM®. It is also contemplated that the housing 52 may alternatively be made from a variety of materials including other plastics (e.g. liquid crystal polymer (LCP), nylon, or polycarbonate) and/or metals (e.g., aluminum, steel, etc.). A suitable ultrasonic drive unit 50 is Model No. HP054, available from Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. The acoustic assembly of the surgical instrument generally includes a first acoustic portion and a second acoustic portion. The first acoustic portion may be carried by the ultrasonic drive unit 50, and the second acoustic portion (in the form of an end effector 180, as will be described) is carried by the ultrasonic clamp coagulator 120. The distal end of the first acoustic portion is operatively coupled to the proximal end of the second acoustic portion, preferably by a threaded connection. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2, the first acoustic portion includes the transducer stack or assembly 40 and a mounting device 84, and the second acoustic portion includes the end effector 180. The end effector 180 may in turn comprise a transmission component, or waveguide 181 (FIG. 3), as well as a distal portion, or blade 180′, for interfacing with tissue. The components of the acoustic assembly may be acoustically tuned such that the length of each component is an integral number of one-half wavelengths (nλ/2), where the wavelength λ is the wavelength of a pre-selected or operating longitudinal vibration frequency ƒ0 of the acoustic assembly, and n is any non-negative integer. It is also contemplated that the acoustic assembly may incorporate any suitable arrangement of acoustic elements. The transducer assembly 40 of the acoustic assembly converts the electrical signal from the generator 30 into mechanical energy that results in longitudinal vibratory motion of the end effector 180 at ultrasonic frequencies. When the acoustic assembly is energized, a vibratory motion standing wave is generated through the acoustic assembly. The excursion of the vibratory motion at any point along the acoustic assembly depends on the location along the acoustic assembly at which the vibratory motion is measured. A minimum or zero crossing in the vibratory motion standing wave is generally referred to as a node (e.g., where motion is usually minimal), and a local absolute value maximum or peak in the standing wave is generally referred to as an anti-node. The distance between an anti-node and its nearest node is one-quarter wavelength (λ/4). In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2, the transducer assembly 40 of the acoustic assembly, which is also known as a “Langevin stack”, generally includes a transduction portion 90, a first resonator 92, and a second resonator 94. The transducer assembly 40 may be an integral number of one-half system wavelengths (nλ/2) in length. It is to be understood that other embodiments of the transducer assembly 40 may comprise a magnetostrictive, electromagnetic or electrostatic transducer. The distal end of the first resonator 92 is connected to the proximal end of transduction section 90, and the proximal end of the second resonator 94 is connected to the distal end of transduction portion 90. The first and second resonators 92 and 94 may be fabricated from titanium, aluminum, steel, or any other suitable material, and most preferably, the first resonator 92 is fabricated from 303 stainless steel and the second resonator 94 is fabricated from 7075-T651 Aluminum. The first and second resonators 92 and 94 have a length determined by a number of variables, including the length of the transduction section 90, the speed of sound of material used in the resonators 92 and 94, and the desired fundamental frequency ƒ0 of the transducer assembly 40. The second resonator 94 can be tapered inwardly from its proximal end to its distal end to function as a velocity transformer and amplify the ultrasonic vibration excursion. The transduction portion 90 of the transducer assembly 40 may comprise a piezoelectric section of alternating positive electrodes 96 and negative electrodes 98, with the piezoelectric elements 100 alternating between the electrodes 96 and 98. The piezoelectric elements 100 can be fabricated from any suitable material, such as, for example, lead zirconate-titanate, lead metaniobate, lead titanate, or other piezoelectric material. Each of the positive electrodes 96, negative electrodes 98, and piezoelectric elements 100 have a bore extending through the center. The positive and negative electrodes 96 and 98 are electrically coupled to wires 102 and 104, respectfully. The wires 102 and 104 transmit the electrical signal from the generator 30 to the electrodes 96 and 98. The piezoelectric elements 100 may be held in compression between the first and second resonators 92 and 94 by a bolt 106. The bolt 106 may have a head, a shank, and a threaded distal end. The bolt 106 may be inserted from the proximal end of the first resonator 92 through the bores of the first resonator 92, the electrodes 96 and 98, and piezoelectric elements 100. The threaded distal end of the bolt 106 is screwed into a threaded bore in the proximal end of second resonator 94. The bolt 106 may be fabricated from steel, titanium, aluminum, or other suitable material. For example, the bolt 106 may be fabricated from Ti-6A1-4V Titanium or from 4037 low alloy steel. The piezoelectric elements 100 may be energized in response to the electrical signal supplied from the generator 30 to produce an acoustic standing wave in the acoustic assembly. The electrical signal causes an electromagnetic field across the piezoelectric elements 100, causing the piezoelectric elements 100 to expand and contract in a continuous manner along the longitudinal axis of the voltage gradient, producing high frequency longitudinal waves of ultrasonic energy. The ultrasonic energy is transmitted through the acoustic assembly to the end effector 180. The mounting device 84 of the acoustic assembly has a proximal end, a distal end, and may have a length substantially equal to an integral number of one-half system wavelengths (nλ/2). The proximal end of the mounting device 84 may be axially aligned and coupled to the distal end of the second resonator 94 by an internal threaded connection near an anti-node. It is also contemplated that the mounting device 84 may be attached to the second resonator 94 by any suitable means, and the second resonator 94 and mounting device 84 may be formed as a single or unitary component. The mounting device 84 is coupled to the housing 52 of the ultrasonic drive unit 50 near a node. The mounting device 84 may include an integral mounting flange 108 disposed around its periphery. The mounting flange 108 may be disposed in an annular groove 110 formed in the housing 52 of the ultrasonic drive unit 50 to couple the mounting device 84 to the housing 52. A compliant member or material 112, such as a pair of silicone rubber O-rings attached by stand-offs, may be placed between the annular groove 110 of the housing 52 and the integral flange 108 of the mounting device 86 to reduce or prevent ultrasonic vibration from being transmitted from the mounting device 84 to the housing 52. The mounting device 84 may be secured in a predetermined axial position by a plurality of pins 114, for example, four. The pins 114 are disposed in a longitudinal direction ninety (90) degrees apart from each other around the outer periphery of the mounting device 84. The pins 114 are coupled to the housing 52 of the ultrasonic drive unit 50 and are disposed through notches in the acoustic mounting flange 108 of the mounting device 84. The pins 114 may be fabricated from stainless steel. According to various embodiments, the pins 114 may be formed as integral components of the housing 52. The mounting device 84 may be configured to amplify the ultrasonic vibration excursion that is transmitted through the acoustic assembly to the distal end of the end effector 180. In one embodiment, the mounting device 84 comprises a solid, tapered horn. As ultrasonic energy is transmitted through the mounting device 84, the velocity of the acoustic wave transmitted through the mounting device 84 is amplified. It is contemplated that the mounting device 84 be configured as any suitable shape, such as, for example, a stepped horn, a conical horn, an exponential horn, a unitary gain horn, or the like. The mounting device 84 may be acoustically coupled to the second acoustic portion of the ultrasonic clamp coagulator instrument 120. The distal end of the mounting device 84 may be coupled to the proximal end of the second acoustic portion by an internal threaded connection near an anti-node, but alternative coupling arrangements can be employed. FIG. 3 illustrates an exploded view of one embodiment the surgical instrument shown in FIG. 1. The proximal end of the ultrasonic clamp coagulator instrument 120 preferably receives and is fitted to the distal end of the ultrasonic drive unit 50 by insertion of the drive unit 50 into the housing 52, as shown in FIG. 2. The ultrasonic clamp coagulator instrument 120 may be attached to and removed from the ultrasonic drive unit 50 as a unit. The ultrasonic clamp coagulator 120 may be disposed of after a single use. The ultrasonic clamp coagulator instrument 120 may include a handle assembly or a housing 130, which may comprise mating housing portions 131, 132, and an elongated or endoscopic portion 150. When the present apparatus is configured for endoscopic use, the construction can be dimensioned such that portion 150 has an outside diameter of about 5.5 mm. The elongated portion 150 of the ultrasonic clamp coagulator instrument 120 may extend substantially orthogonally from the apparatus housing 130. The elongated portion 150 can be selectively rotated with respect to the housing 130 as described below. The elongated portion 150 may include an outer tubular member or sheath 160, an inner tubular actuating member 170, and the second acoustic portion of the acoustic system in the form of an end effector 180 including a blade 180′. As will be described, the outer sheath 160, the actuating member 170, and the end effector 180 may be joined together for indexed rotation as a unit (together with ultrasonic drive unit 50) relative to housing 130. The proximal end of the end effector 180 of the second acoustic portion may be detachably coupled to the mounting device 84 of the ultrasonic drive unit 50 near an anti-node as described above. The end effector 180 may have a length substantially equal to an integer number of one-half system wavelengths (nλ/2). The end effector 180 may be fabricated from a solid core shaft constructed out of material which propagates ultrasonic energy efficiently, such as a titanium alloy (e.g., Ti-6A1-4V) or an aluminum alloy. It is contemplated that the end effector 180 can alternatively be fabricated from any other suitable material. As described, the end effector 180 may include a waveguide 181. The waveguide 181 may be substantially semi-flexible. It will be recognized that the waveguide 181 can alternatively be substantially rigid or may comprise a flexible wire. The waveguide 181 may be configured to amplify the mechanical vibrations transmitted through the waveguide to the blade as is well known in the art. The waveguide 181 may further have features to control the gain of the longitudinal vibration along the waveguide 181 and features to tune the waveguide to the resonant frequency of the system. It will be recognized that the end effector 180 may have any suitable cross-sectional dimension. For example, the end effector 180 may have a substantially uniform cross-section or the end effector 180 may be tapered at various sections or may be tapered along its entire length. Referring now to FIG. 3, the waveguide 181 portion of the end effector 180 is shown to comprise a first section 182, a second section 184, and a third section 186. The first section 182 of may extend distally from the proximal end of the end effector 180, and has a substantially continuous cross-section dimension. The first section 182 may include at least one radial hole or aperture 188 extending diametrically therethrough, substantially perpendicular to the axis of the end effector 180. The aperture 188 may be positioned at a node, but may be otherwise positioned. It will be recognized that the aperture 188 may have any suitable depth and may be any suitable shape. The aperture 188 is configured to receive a connector pin member which connects the wave guide 181, the tubular actuating member 170, and the tubular outer sheath 160 together for conjoint, indexed rotation relative to apparatus housing 130. The second section 184 of the wave guide 181 extends distally from the first section 182. The second section 184 preferably also has a substantially continuous cross-section. The diameter of the second section 184 may be smaller than the diameter of the first section 182 and larger than the diameter of the third section 186. As ultrasonic energy passes from the first section 182 of the end effector 180 into the second section 184, narrowing of the second section 184 will result in an increased amplitude of the ultrasonic energy passing therethrough. The third section 186 extends distally from the distal end of the second section 184. The third section 186 also has a substantially continuous cross-section. The third section 186 also may include small diameter changes along its length. According to various embodiments, the transition from the second section 184 to the third section 186 may be positioned at an anti-node so that the diameter change in the third section does not bring about an increase in the amplitude of vibration. The third section 186 may have a plurality of grooves or notches (not shown) formed in its outer circumference. The grooves may be located at nodes of the end effector 180 to act as alignment indicators for the installation of a damping sheath (not shown) and stabilizing silicone rings or compliant supports during manufacturing. A seal may be provided at the distal-most node, nearest the blade 180′, to abate passage of tissue, blood, and other material in the region between the waveguide and actuating member 170. The blade 180′ of the end effector 180 may be integral therewith and formed as a single unit. The blade 180′ may alternately be connected by a threaded connection, or by a welded joint. According to various embodiments, the blade 180′ may be mechanically sharp or mechanically blunt. The distal end of the blade 180′ is disposed near an anti-node in order to tune the acoustic assembly to a preferred resonant frequency ƒ0 when the acoustic assembly is not loaded by tissue. When the transducer assembly is energized, the distal end of the blade 180′ is configured to move longitudinally in the range of, for example, approximately 10-500 microns peak-to-peak, and preferably in the range of about 10 to about 100 microns at a predetermined vibrational frequency ƒ0. In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, the blade 180′ may be cylindrical for cooperation with the associated clamping mechanism of the clamp coagulator 120. The end effector 180 may receive suitable surface treatment, as is known in the art. FIG. 4 illustrates one embodiment of a clamping mechanism that may be used with the surgical instrument shown in FIG. 1. The clamping mechanism may be configured for cooperative action with the blade 180′ of the end effector 180. The clamping mechanism includes a pivotally movable clamp arm 190, which is pivotally connected at the distal end thereof to the distal end of outer tubular sheath 160. The clamp arm 190 includes a clamp arm tissue pad 192, preferably formed from TEFLON® or other suitable low-friction material, which is mounted for cooperation with the blade 180′, with pivotal movement of the clamp arm 190 positioning the clamp pad 192 in substantially parallel relationship to, and in contact with, the blade 180′. By this construction, tissue to be clamped is grasped between the tissue pad 192 and the blade 180′. The tissue pad 192 may be provided with a sawtooth-like configuration including a plurality of axially spaced, proximally extending gripping teeth 197 to enhance the gripping of tissue in cooperation with the blade 180′. Pivotal movement of the clamp arm 190 with respect to the blade 180′ is effected by the provision of at least one, and preferably a pair of lever portions 193 of the clamp arm 190 at the proximal end thereof. The lever portions 193 are positioned on respective opposite sides of the end effector 180 and blade 180′, and are in operative engagement with a drive portion 194 of the reciprocal actuating member 170. Reciprocal movement of the actuating member 170, relative to the outer tubular sheath 160 and the end effector 180, thereby effects pivotal movement of the clamp arm 190 relative to the blade 180′. The lever portions 193 can be respectively positioned in a pair of openings defined by the drive portion 194, or otherwise suitably mechanically coupled therewith, whereby reciprocal movement of the actuating member 170 acts through the drive portion 194 and lever portions 193 to pivot the clamp arm 190. FIG. 5 illustrates a cut-away view of one embodiment of the surgical instrument shown in FIG. 1, while FIG. 6 illustrates various internal components of one embodiment of the surgical instrument shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 7 illustrates one embodiment of a drive yoke, and FIG. 8 illustrates one embodiment of a drive collar of the surgical instrument shown in FIG. 1. In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 5-8, reciprocal movement of the actuating member 170 is effected by the provision of a drive collar 200 mounted on the proximal end of the actuating member 170 for conjoint rotation. The drive collar 200 may include a pair of diametrically opposed axially extending arms 202 each having a drive lug 204, with the drive lugs 204 being biased by the arms 202 into engagement with suitable openings 206 defined by the proximal portion of tubular actuating member 170. Rotation of the drive collar 200 together with the actuating member 170 is further effected by the provision of a pair of keys 208 diametrically engageable with suitable openings 210 defined by the proximal end of the actuating member 170. A circumferential groove 211 on the actuating member 170 receives an O-ring 211′ (FIG. 3) for engagement with the inside surface of outer sheath 160. Rotation of the actuating member 170 together with the tubular outer sheath 160 and inner end effector 180 is provided by a connector pin 212 extending through these components of the instrument 120. The tubular actuating member 170 defines an elongated slot 214 through which the connector pin 212 extends to accommodate reciprocal movement of the actuating member relative to the outer tubular sheath and inner waveguide. A rotation knob 216 mounted on the outer tubular sheath facilitates rotational positioning of the elongated portion 150 with respect to the housing 130 of the clamp coagulator instrument 120. Connector pin 212 preferably joins the knob 216 together with the sheath 160, member 170, and the end effector 180 for rotation as a unit relative to the housing 130. In the embodiment, hub portion 216′ of the rotation knob 216 acts to rotatably mount the outer sheath 160, the actuating member 170, and the end effector 180 (as a unit with the knob 216), on the housing 130. The drive collar 200 provides a portion of the clamp drive mechanism of the instrument 120, which effects pivotal movement of the clamp arm 190 by reciprocation of the actuating member 170. The clamp drive mechanism further includes a drive yoke 220 which is operatively connected with an operating lever 222, with the operating lever thus interconnected with the reciprocal actuating member 170 via drive yoke 220 and drive collar 200. The operating lever 222 is pivotally connected to the housing 130 of the apparatus (by a pivot mount 223) for cooperation in a scissors-like fashion with a handgrip portion 224 of the housing. Movement of the lever 222 toward the handgrip portion 224 translates the actuating member 170 proximally, thereby pivoting the clamp arm 190 toward the blade 180′. Operative connection of the drive yoke 220 with the operating lever 222 is provided by a spring 226, preferably comprising a compression coil spring 226. The spring 226 fits within a spring slot 228 defined by the drive yoke 220, which in turn is positioned between a pair of spring retainer flanges 230 of the operating lever 222. The drive yoke 220 is pivotally movable with respect to the spring flanges 230 (about pivot mount 223 of housing 130) in opposition to the compression coil spring, which bears against the surfaces of the spring slots defined by each of the spring flanges 230. In this manner, the force which can be applied to the actuating member 170, by pivotal movement of the operating lever 222 acting through the drive yoke 220 and the drive collar 200, is limited by the force with which the spring 226 bears against the spring flanges 230. Application of excessive force results in pivotal displacement of the drive yoke 220 relative to the spring flanges 230 of the operating lever 222 in opposition to spring 226. Stop portions of the housing 130 limit the travel of the operating lever 222 to prevent excessive compression of spring 226. In various embodiments, the force applied to the actuating member 170 may be limited by one or more springs (not shown) operatively positioned between the drive collar 200 and the member 170. For example, one or more cylindrical springs, such as a wave springs, may be used. An example embodiment utilizing a wave spring in this manner is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,458,142, which is incorporated herein by reference. Indexed rotational positioning of the elongated portion 150 of the present clamp coagulator instrument 120 may be provided by the provision of a detent mechanism incorporated into the clamp drive mechanism of the instrument 120. Specifically, the drive collar 200 may include a pair of axially spaced apart drive flanges 232. A detent-receiving surface may be provided between the drive flanges 232, and may define a plurality of circumferentially spaced teeth 234. The teeth 234 may define detent-receiving depressions generally about the periphery of the drive collar 200. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 7, twelve (12) of the teeth 234 are provided, thereby providing indexed positioning of the elongated portion 150 of the apparatus at 30° intervals relative to the housing 130 of the apparatus. Indexed rotational movement may be further achieved by the provision of at least one, and preferably a pair, of diametrically opposed detents 236 respectively provided on cantilevered yoke arms 238 of the drive yoke 220. By this arrangement, the yoke arms 238 are positioned between the drive flanges 232 for engagement with the confronting surfaces thereof, and bias the detents 236 into engagement with the drive collar 200. Indexed relative rotation is thus achieved, with the detents 236 of the yoke arms 238 cooperating with the drive flanges 238 for effecting reciprocation of the actuating member 170. According to various embodiments, the drive yoke 220 may be formed from suitable polymeric material, with the biasing force created by the yoke arms 238 acting on the detents 236 thereof cooperating with the radial depressions defined by the drive collar to resist relative rotational torque less than about 5 to 20 inch-ounces. Accordingly, the elongated portion 150 of the clamp coagulator instrument 120 is maintained in any of its selected indexed rotational positions, relative to the housing 130, unless a torque is applied (such as by the rotation knob 216) exceeding this predetermined torque level. A snap-like indexing action is thus provided. Rotation of the elongated proportion 150 of the present clamp coagulator instrument 120 may be effected together with relative rotational movement of ultrasonic drive unit 50 with respect to housing 130. In order to join the elongated portion 150 to the ultrasonic drive unit 50 in ultrasonic-transmitting relationship, the proximal portion of the outer tubular sheath 160 may be provided with a pair of wrench flats 240 (FIG. 3). The wrench flats allow torque to be applied by a suitable torque wrench or the like to thereby permit the end effector 180 to be joined to the ultrasonic drive unit 50. The ultrasonic drive unit 50, as well as the elongated portion 150, are thus rotatable, as a unit, by suitable manipulation of the rotation knob 216, relative to the housing 130 of the apparatus. The interior of housing 130 is dimensioned to accommodate such relative rotation of the drive unit 50. FIG. 9 illustrates one embodiment of a surgical system 250 including a surgical instrument 251 having single element end effector 256. The system 250 may include a transducer assembly 252 coupled to the end effector 256 and a sheath 254 positioned around the proximal portions of the end effector 256 as shown. The transducer assembly 252 and end effector 256 may operate in a manner similar to that of the transducer assembly 50 and end effector 180 described above to produce ultrasonic energy that may be transmitted to tissue via blade 256′ FIG. 10 illustrates one embodiment of a surgical device 300. FIGS. 11-12 illustrate exploded views of one embodiment of the surgical device 300 shown in FIG. 10. Generally, the surgical instrument 300 may comprise a transducer assembly 302, an end effector 304 and a lower jaw 306. The end effector 304 may be at least partially enclosed by a sheath 314. The lower jaw 306 may include a clamp face 308, and may be slidable relative to the end effector to bring the clamp face 308 toward a distal end of the end effector 304. According to various embodiments, the end effector 304 and/or the lower jaw 306 may define a lumen for aspirating a surgical site. Also, various blades 304′ may be included with the end effector 304, for example, to bring about different surgical results. FIGS. 13-14 illustrate one embodiment of the surgical device 300 shown in FIG. 10 configured in an open position with the blade 304′ and clamp 308 separated from one another. In use, a clinician may introduce the device 300 to a surgical site the open position illustrated in FIGS. 13-14. When the device 300 is properly positioned, the clinician may transition the device 300 to a closed position, for example, by actuating a trigger 310. FIGS. 15-16 illustrate one embodiment of the surgical device 300 shown in FIG. 10 configured in a closed position with the blade 304′ and clamp 308 translated towards one another. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 15-16, the trigger has been rotated towards a handle 312, causing the lower jaw 306 to translate relative to the end effector 304, and bringing the clamp face 308 towards the blade 304′. In this way tissue may be clamped between the blade 304′ and the clamp face 308. Energizing the end effector 304 may cause coagulation and/or cutting of the clamped tissue. The various components of the surgical device 300 may be arranged in any suitable way. FIGS. 19-20 illustrate a handle region of one embodiment of the device 300 shown in FIG. 10. According to various embodiments, a frame member 316 may couple to the handle 312 and the trigger 310. The handle 312 may include a slot 334 for receiving the trigger 310. When the trigger 310 is positioned within the slot 334, and the frame member 316 is fitted over the handle 312 and trigger 310, the bore holes 328, 330 and 332 may align (FIGS. 11-12). Pin 320 may pass through bore holes 328, 330 and 332 to secure the frame member 316, the handle 312 and the trigger 310. The transducer assembly 302 and the end effector 304 may be received into a cavity 334 of the frame member 316. The sheath 314 may be received into a distal end of the cavity 334. A pin 318 may be placed through bore holes 340, 338 and 342 to secure the sheath 314, the end effector 304 and the frame member 316. In addition, the sheath 314 may include a tongue feature 324 that may be received into a corresponding groove feature 336 of the handle 312. (FIG. 11) FIGS. 17-18 illustrate one embodiment of a lower jaw 306 and outer sheath 314 of the surgical device 300 shown in FIG. 10, including a view of the tongue feature 324 of the sheath 314. The lower jaw 306 may be coupled to the trigger 310 as well as the sheath 314, allowing the lower jaw 306 to translate relative to the sheath 314 and the end effector 304 when the trigger 310 is drawn toward the handle 312. For example, the lower jaw 306 may define a groove feature 326 configured to receive the tongue feature 324 of the sheath (FIGS. 17-18). A proximal end 348 of the lower jaw 306 may define one or more bore holes 346. The bore hole(s) 346 may be aligned with a slot 344 of the trigger 312, allowing pin 322 to be inserted. As illustrated in FIG. 19, the trigger 310 may pivot toward the handle 312 about pin 320. This may cause the pin 322 to slide within the slot 344, exerting a proximally directed force on the lower jaw 306 and causing the clamp face 308 to translate toward the blade 304′ of the end effector 304. In the embodiments described above, the lower jaw 306 is slidable while the end effector 304 remains stationary. FIG. 20A illustrates one embodiment of a surgical device 300′ where the lower jaw is stationary and the end effector is slidable. A frame member 316′ may couple the transducer 302, sheath 314 and end effector 304. A trigger 310′ may couple to a consolidated handle/lower jaw member 306′ at pivot point 380, and to the frame member 316′ at pivot point 382. According to various embodiments, the pivot points 380 and 382 may comprise a pin and slot, as described above. In use, the clinician may pull the trigger 310′ toward the proximal portion of the handle/lower jaw member 306′. This may cause the trigger 310′ to rotate about the pivot point 380 and exert a distal force on the frame member 316′, transducer 302 and end effector 304, pushing the blade 304′ of the end effector distally toward the clamp face 308. FIG. 20B illustrates one embodiment of the surgical device 300′ where the end effector 304 is configured to rotate as it moves forward toward the clamp face 308. The frame member 316′ may include slots 390. The end effector 304 may include a pin 392, which may be received by the slots 390. As the end effector 304 is moved distally, as described above, the orientation of the slots 392 may exert a torque on the pint 392, and consequently the end effector 304, causing it to rotate as shown. In various embodiments, the pin 392 may be replaced with multiple pins (not shown). For example, one pin may be placed on a first side of the end effector 304 and may be received by a first slot 390, while another pin may be placed on a second side of the end effector 304 and may be received by a second slot 390 opposite the first. The end effector 304 and the blade 304′ may be constructed according to any suitable solid or hollow-core configuration. FIG. 21 illustrates a distal portion of one embodiment of the surgical device shown in FIG. 10 including a blade 304′ defining a hollow lumen 350. FIG. 22 illustrates one embodiment of the blade 304′ shown in FIG. 21. According to various embodiments, suction may be provided through the lumen 350 to aspirate tissue that is cut and coagulated by the end effector 304. FIG. 23 illustrates a distal portion of one embodiment of the surgical device 300 shown in FIG. 10 including a blade 304′ defining a hollow lumen 350 and having two members 352 extending across the hollow lumen 350. FIG. 24 illustrates one embodiment of the blade 304′ shown in FIG. 21. The members 352 may serve to cut tissue into portions smaller than the diameter of the lumen 350, thus lessening the risk of clogging the lumen 350. Various embodiments may include more or fewer members 352 than are shown. Also, the members 352 are shown to intersect one another at a right angle, although any other suitable configuration may be used. FIG. 25 illustrates a distal portion of one embodiment of the surgical device 300 shown in FIG. 10 including a jaw member 306 defining a lumen, while FIG. 26 illustrates one embodiment of a blade 304′ for use with the surgical device as shown in FIG. 25. The blade 304′ of the end effector 304 may define a cavity 360. When the clamp face 308 is brought toward the blade 304′, the cavity 360 may cover a corresponding well 356 defined by the lower jaw 306. They well 356 may define an opening 354 to a lumen located within the lower jaw 306. Tissue cut and or coagulated by the end effector 304 may be aspirated via the lumen and its opening 354. FIG. 26A illustrates an additional embodiment of the blade 304′ having cutting members 361 positioned within the cavity 360. In use, the cutting members may morcellate tissue, reducing the size of tissue pieces received into the opening 354 and lessening the risk that the lumen will clog. FIG. 27 illustrates a distal portion of one embodiment of the surgical device shown in FIG. 10. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 27, the end effector 304 may include a blade 304′ defining a sharp edge 364. The blade 304′ may cover the well 356 and lumen opening 354 as described above. FIG. 28 illustrates a distal portion of one embodiment of the surgical device 300 shown in FIG. 10 including a plug feature 362 received into a hollow lumen 350 of the end effector 304. When the clamp face 308 is brought toward the end effector 304, the plug feature 362 may be received into a lumen 350 defined by the end effector 304. In this way, the plug feature may help to remove any clogs or blockages present within the lumen 350. According to various embodiments, the plug feature 362 may have a cross sectional area smaller than that of the lumen 350. This may generally limit tissue portions removed by the device 300 to sizes smaller than the diameter of the lumen 350, reducing the likelihood of clogs. FIG. 28A illustrates one embodiment of the surgical device 300 including a rotating end effector 370. The rotating end effector 370 may mount to an electric motor 372. FIG. 28B illustrates one embodiment of the electric motor 372 mounted to the end effector 370. A rotor 376 of the motor 372 may be mounted around the end effector 370. A coil 374 of the motor 372 may, when energized, cause the rotor 376 and end effector 370 to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise. In use, the lower jaw 306 may be translated with respect to the end effector 370, causing the clamp face 308 to translate toward a blade 370′ of the rotating end effector 370. According to various embodiments, the embodiment shown in FIGS. 28A and 28B also may include a transducer (not shown in FIGS. 28A and 28B) for ultrasonically exciting the end effector 370. Accordingly, the end effector 370 may be rotated and ultrasonically excited simultaneously. Also, FIG. 28A illustrates a clamp pad 377 positioned between the clamp face 308 and the blade 370′. The clamp pad 377 may be made from any suitable material including, for example, a polymeric material. FIG. 28C illustrates one embodiment of the surgical device 300″ having an angled blade 304″. The lower jaw 306 and clamp face 308″ may slide relative to the end effector 304 and blade 304″ according to any suitable method including, for example, the methods described above with respect to FIGS. 10, 20A, and 20B. The blade 304″ may have a distal surface 381 that is angled relative to the device 300″. For example, the distal surface 381 of the blade 304″ may be angled at an angle of 45°. According to various embodiments, the clamp face 308″ may also be angled, as shown, to match the angle of the blade 304″. FIGS. 29-36 show various embodiments of hollow core end effectors that may be utilized to cut and/or coagulate tissue. The end effectors may define a central lumen and may comprise at least one member extended across at least a portion of the central lumen at a distal end of the end effector. The member or members may serve to break-up bone or other tissue before it passes through the lumen, making it less likely that the lumen will be clogged by tissue material. According to various embodiments, the end effectors may be utilized with any suitable manual or ultrasonic instrument. For example, the end effectors may be utilized with the surgical devices 10, 250 and 300 described above. FIG. 29 illustrates one embodiment of a hollow core end effector 400 comprising members 404, 406 extending across a lumen 402 defined by the end effector 400. The members 404 and 406 may comprise wires that may be bonded to the end effector 400 at various points including points 408 and 410. The wires may be bonded to the end effector 400 according to any suitable method including, welding, adhesive, etc. Also, although the embodiment shown in FIG. 29 includes two members 404 and 406 intersecting at about the center of the lumen 402, it will be appreciated that any other suitable configuration or number of members may be utilized. FIG. 30 illustrates one embodiment of a hollow core end effector 412 comprising members 414, 416 extending across a lumen 402, while FIG. 31 illustrates a cut away view of one embodiment of the hollow core end effector 412 shown in FIG. 30. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 30-31, the members 414 and 416 may be machined into the end effector 412 itself. Accordingly, portions of the members 414, 416 may extend proximally into the lumen 402. FIG. 31A illustrates one embodiment of a hollow core end effector 413 having angled members 417. The members 417 may not extend across the lumen 402. Instead, some or all of the angled members 417 may terminate in a central portion of the lumen 402. FIG. 32 illustrates one embodiment of an end effector 418 having a non-integral blade 420. The blade 420 may include one or more members 422, for example, as described above with respect to end effectors 400 and 412. The blade 420 may be bonded to the remainder of the end effector 418 according to any suitable method. For example, the surfaces 424 and 426 may be threaded, allowing the blade 420 to be threaded onto the remainder of the end effector 418. Also, the blade 420 and end effector 418 may be coupled by press fitting, welding, brazing, adhesive bonding, etc. According to various embodiments, the non-integral blade 420 and the remainder of the end effector 418 may be made from different materials. For example, the end effector 418 may be made from a titanium alloy or other material with a low resistance to ultrasonic wave transmission. The blade 420 may be, in turn, made from material that is easily machined, and/or holds an edge such as, for example, a steel. FIG. 33 illustrates one embodiment of an end effector 428 having a member 430 extended across a lumen 434 and edges 432 extending beyond the member 430. The member 430, as shown, is positioned proximally from the distal edge of the end effector 428. For example, the member 430 may be recessed within the lumen 434 by a distance of up to 15 mm. FIG. 34 illustrates one embodiment of an end effector 436 having an inter-lumen member 442 positioned non-parallel to a longitudinal axis 440 of the end effector 436. The member 442 may extend proximally into the lumen 438 at an angle that is not parallel to the axis 440. This may facilitate the cutting and removing of small portions of tissue, such as tissue portion 441. FIG. 35 illustrates one embodiment of an end effector 444 having a multi-section inter-lumen member 448. Each of the sections 450, 452 of the inter-lumen member 448 may be positioned at different angles relative to the longitudinal axis 446. FIG. 36 illustrates one embodiment of an end effector 454 having inter-lumen members 458, 460 extending distally from the lumen 434. The members 458, 460 may be angled relative to the longitudinal axis 459, as described above. The members 458 and 460 also may extend beyond the distal edge of the other portions of the end effector 454. FIGS. 37-54 illustrate various embodiments of surgical devices that may be used as an ultrasonic or unpowered device to remove tissue portions. The embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 37-54 may be useful in surgical applications where it is desirable to remove a core or other integral portion of bone or other tissue. The devices may generally comprise a central instrument configured to engage tissue and an outer sheath surrounding the central instrument. The central instrument and sheath may be slidable relative to one another. Also, the outer sheath may comprise a distal edge configured to clamp the tissue when the central instrument is slid to a position proximal from the distal edge of the outer sheath. FIGS. 37-40 illustrate a sequence of one embodiment of a surgical device 500 in use. The surgical device 500 may comprise a central instrument 502 and an outer sheath 504. The central instrument 502 comprises two jaw members 506 and 508. In use, the jaw member 506 may be pivotable toward the jaw member 508. According to various embodiments, the jaw member 508 may be ultrasonically energized, for example, as described above. FIG. 37 illustrates one embodiment of the surgical device 500 with a portion of tissue 510 positioned between the jaw members 506, 508. FIG. 38 illustrates one embodiment of the surgical device 500 shown in FIG. 37 where the central instrument 502 is grasping tissue. This may occur when the jaw members 506, 508 are pivoted toward one another to engage the tissue 510. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 38, the outer sheath 504 has been moved distally relative to the central instrument 502. FIG. 39 illustrates one embodiment of the surgical device 500 shown in FIG. 37 where the outer sheath 504 has clamped the tissue 510. This may occur when a distal portion of the outer sheath 504 clears the distal edge of the central instrument 502, allowing the outer sheath 504, and/or a component thereof, to clamp the tissue 510. According to various embodiments, a distal edge 512 of the outer sheath 504 may define a sharp edge to sever the tissue. Also, according to various embodiments, outer sheath 504 may be ultrasonically activated to promote cutting and/or coagulation. Once the outer sheath 504 has clamped the tissue 510, a clinician may manipulate the device 500, causing the clamped tissue 510 to tear or break. FIG. 40 illustrates one embodiment of the surgical device 500 shown in FIG. 37 where the tissue 510 has been severed. The outer sheath 504 may exert a clamping force on the tissue 510 according to various different methods. For example, the outer sheath 504 may be constructed such that the distal edge portion 512 is biased in upon itself. Accordingly, the rest state of the edge portion 512 may be a closed or clamped position, as illustrated in FIG. 40. When the central instrument 502 is extended distally through the outer sheath 504, it may separate the edge portion 512, for example, as illustrated in FIGS. 37-38. According to various embodiments, the distal edge 512 may include multiple distal edge portions separated by one or more longitudinal slots (not shown). This may allow the distal edge 512 to separate. When the central instrument 502 is retracted through the outer sheath 504 the edge portion 512 may contract to its closed or clamped position, cutting or otherwise clamping the tissue 510. According to various embodiments, the edge portion 512 of the outer sheath 504 may be ultrasonically activated to promote cutting and/or coagulation of the tissue 510. FIGS. 41-42 illustrate one embodiment of the surgical device 500 shown in FIG. 37 where the outer sheath comprises edge members 514. The edge members 514 may extend distally, as shown in FIG. 41, in response to the actuation of a trigger or other component of the device (not shown). When the edge members 514 reach the distal end of the outer sheath, they contract toward one another, as shown in FIG. 42, to sever or otherwise clamp the tissue 510. According to various embodiments, the members 514 may be ultrasonically activated. FIGS. 43-46 illustrate one embodiment of the outer sheath 504 including jaw members 520. The jaw members 520 may pivot toward one another about pivot points 524 in response to distal movement of extenders 522. For example, when the central instrument 502 is initially engaging tissue 510, as shown in FIGS. 37-38, the extenders 522 may be retracted, leaving the jaw members 520 in an open position as shown in FIGS. 43 and 45. When the outer sheath 504 is extended distally relative to the central instrument, the extenders 522 may be translated distally. Distal translation of the extenders 522 may be caused by various mechanical or automated forces, for example, in response to a clinician activating a trigger or other component of the device (not shown). This distal translation may cause the jaw members 520 to pivot about pivot points 524 to a closed position, as shown in FIGS. 44 and 46. FIGS. 47-51 illustrate another sequence of one embodiment of a surgical device 500 in use. The embodiment shown in FIGS. 47-51 may comprise a central instrument 530 that includes an ultrasonic end effector defining a coring cavity 532. When the central instrument 530 is extended into tissue 510, it may cut and/or coagulate around a portion of the tissue 535 corresponding to the cavity 532. FIG. 47 illustrates one embodiment of the surgical instrument 500 brought into the proximity of a mass of tissue 510. FIG. 48 illustrates one embodiment of the surgical instrument 500 of FIG. 47 where the central instrument 530 is extended into the tissue 510. Ultrasonic energy may be provided to the central instrument 530, allowing it to cut into the tissue 510. FIG. 49 illustrates one embodiment of the surgical instrument 500 of FIG. 47 where the central instrument 530 has been retracted from the tissue 510, leaving a core section 535 that has been partially severed from the tissue 510. FIG. 50 illustrates one embodiment of the surgical instrument 500 of FIG. 47 where the outer sheath 504 has been extended into the tissue 510. The outer sheath 504 may either sever the core section 535, or clamp it, allowing the clinician to tear or otherwise loosen the core section 535. FIG. 51 illustrates one embodiment of the surgical instrument 500 of FIG. 47 where the outer sheath 504 has been retracted from the tissue 510, removing the core section 535. According to various embodiments, the device 500 may omit the central instrument 502. For example, the outer sheath 504 may be ultrasonically energized to cut a portion of the tissue 510 in a manner similar to that of the central instrument 530. The outer sheath 504 may then clamp the tissue 510 for severing or tearing, for example, as described above. The surgical device 500 may be operated by a clinician from a handle portion (not shown) that may include one or more triggers for actuating the central instrument 502 and the outer sheath 504. For example, the central instrument 502 may be actuated by any suitable manual or automatic means including, for example, a mechanical design similar to that described above with respect to the blade 180′ and clamp arm 190. The outer sheath 504 may similarly be extended and actuated by any suitable manual or automatic means. For example, the outer sheath 504 may be extended distally in response to the actuation of a trigger in a manner similar to the way that the reciprocal actuating member 170 is extended distally in response to actuation of the operating lever 222 described above. According to various embodiments, the central instrument 502 and the outer sheath 504 may be actuated by a single pull of a trigger. For example, a single trigger pull may both actuate the central instrument 502 and also subsequently extend and actuate the outer sheath 504. FIGS. 52-55 illustrate force-feedback surgical devices, according to various embodiments, configured to apply ultrasonic energy to tissue at a variable power level and/or end effector amplitude. The level of power or end effector amplitude provided to the devices may be determined, for example, based on the force applied to a trigger, and/or the position or travel of the trigger. It will be appreciated that force feedback surgical devices, such as the embodiments shown in FIGS. 52-55, may give clinicians an increased level of control over the ultrasonic power delivered by the devices, facilitating precise operations. FIG. 52 illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of a force feedback surgical device 600. The device 600 may include an ultrasonic end effector 602, which may be activated when a clinician operates a trigger 610. When the trigger 610 is actuated, a force sensor 612 may generate a signal indicating the amount of force being applied to the trigger 610. In addition to, or instead of force sensor 612, the device 600 may include a position sensor 613, which may generate a signal indicating the position of the trigger 610 (e.g., how far the trigger has been depressed or otherwise actuated). A control circuit 608 may receive the signals from the sensors 612 and/or 613. The control circuit 608 may include any suitable analog or digital circuit components. The control circuit 608 also may communicate with the generator 606 and/or the transducer 604 to modulate the power delivered to the end effector 602 and/or the generator level or blade amplitude of the end effector 602 based on the force applied to the trigger 610 and/or the position of the trigger 610. For example, as more force is applied to the trigger 610, more power and/or a higher blade amplitude may be delivered to the end effector 602. According to various embodiments, the force sensor 612 may be replaced by a multi-position switch. FIG. 57 illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of the surgical device 600 of FIG. 52 where the force sensor 612 is replaced by a multi-position switch 615. Each position of the switch may correspond to a different level of power to be delivered to the end effector 602. According to various embodiments, the end effector 602 may include a clamping mechanism, for example, such as that described above with respect to FIG. 4. When the trigger 610 is initially actuated, clamping mechanism may close, clamping tissue between a clamp arm and the end effector 602. As the force applied to the trigger increases (e.g., as sensed by force sensor 612) the control circuit 608 may increase the power delivered to the end effector 602 by the transducer 604 and/or the generator level or blade amplitude brought about in the end effector 602. In one embodiment, trigger position, as sensed by position sensor 613, may be used by the control circuit 608 to set the power and/or amplitude of the end effector 602. For example, as the trigger is moved further towards a fully actuated position, the power and/or amplitude of the end effector 602 may be increased. According to various embodiments, the surgical device 600 also may include one or more feedback devices for indicating the amount of power delivered to the end effector 602. For example, a speaker 614 may emit a signal indicative of the end effector power. According to various embodiments, the speaker 614 may emit a series of pulse sounds, where the frequency of the sounds indicates power. In addition to, or instead of the speaker 614, the device may include a visual display 616. The visual display 616 may indicate end effector power according to any suitable method. For example, the visual display 616 may include a series of light emitting diodes (LEDs), where end effector power is indicated by the number of illuminated LEDs. The speaker 614 and/or visual display 616 may be driven by the control circuit 608. According to various embodiments, the device 600 may include a ratcheting device (not shown) connected to the trigger 610. The ratcheting device may generate an audible sound as more force is applied to the trigger 610, providing an indirect indication of end effector power. The device 600 may include other features that may enhance safety. For example, the control circuit 608 may be configured to prevent power from being delivered to the end effector 602 in excess of a predetermined threshold. Also, the control circuit 608 may implement a delay between the time when a change in end effector power is indicated (e.g., by speaker 614 or display 616), and the time when the change in end effector power is delivered. In this way, a clinician may have ample warning that the level of ultrasonic power that is to be delivered to the end effector 602 is about to change. Force-feedback ultrasonic devices, such as the device 600, may be physically implemented in any suitable form. For example, FIG. 53 illustrates one embodiment of a force-feedback surgical device 620. The device 620 may comprise an ultrasonic end effector 622 excitable by a transducer 632. The transducer 632 may be in communication with a generator (not shown) via a wire 636. A clamp arm 624 may be pivotable towards the end effector 622 when a clinician pulls a trigger 628 towards a handle 626, similar to the clamp arm 190 and blade 180′ described above. A sensor 630 positioned on the trigger 628 may measure the force applied to the trigger 628 by the clinician and/or the position of the trigger 628. It will be appreciated that the sensor 630 may be alternatively placed at other locations within the device 620 including, for example, at trigger pivot point 634 or between the end effector 622 and clamp arm 624. A control circuit (not shown) may be positioned at any suitable location on or in the device 620 including, for example, within the handle 626 or trigger 628, the ultrasonic drive unit 50 or the generator 30. FIG. 54-55 illustrate one embodiment of another force-feedback surgical device 640, which may be configured as an ultrasonic rongeur-type device. The device 640 may include a pair of handles 642, 644 that when squeezed towards one another about pivot point 646 may cause a pair of distally positioned jaw members 648, 650 to pivot towards one another to engage tissue by clamping or severing. One or both of the jaw members 648, 650 may include an ultrasonically active end effector. For example, FIG. 54 illustrates an ultrasonic end effector 652 positioned on jaw member 650 and driven by transducer 656. The transducer 656 may be in communication with a generator (not shown) via a wire 657. A clamp pad 654 may be positioned opposite the end effector 652. The transducer 656 may be positioned between the handles 642, 644, as shown, or at any other suitable position. For example, the transducer 656 may be positioned within one of the handles 642, 644. Force sensors 658, 660 may be positioned on the handles 642, 644 as shown, or may be positioned at various other locations within the device 640 including, for example, at the pivot point 646. Likewise, the control circuit (not shown) may be positioned at any suitable location on or in the device 640. FIG. 56 illustrates one embodiment of another force feedback surgical device 700 comprising a hand-piece adapter 708. The device 700 may also comprise a transducer 704 configured to drive an end effector 702, for example, as described herein. The hand-piece adapter 708 may comprise one or more switches 706 for operating the transducer 704 and end effector 702. For example, actuating one or more of the switches 706 may cause the device 700 to activate. The switches 706 may correspond to the trigger 610 described with respect to FIG. 52. One or more sensors (not shown in FIG. 56) may be provided to sense the travel of the switches 706 and/or the amount of force applied to the switches 706 by the clinician. A control circuit (not shown in FIG. 56) may modulate the device power and/or end effector amplitude based on the output of the one or more sensors as described herein. The devices disclosed herein can be designed to be disposed of after a single use, or they can be designed to be used multiple times. In either case, however, the device may be reconditioned for reuse after at least one use. Reconditioning can include any combination of the steps of disassembly of the device, followed by cleaning or replacement of particular elements, and subsequent reassembly. In particular, the device may be disassembled, and any number of particular elements or components of the device may be selectively replaced or removed in any combination. Upon cleaning and/or replacement of particular components, the device may be reassembled for subsequent use either at a reconditioning facility, or by a surgical team immediately prior to a surgical procedure. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that reconditioning of a device may utilize a variety of techniques for disassembly, cleaning/replacement, and reassembly. Use of such techniques, and the resulting reconditioned device, are all within the scope of the present application. Preferably, the various embodiments described herein will be processed before surgery. First, a new or used instrument is obtained and if necessary cleaned. The instrument can then be sterilized.
