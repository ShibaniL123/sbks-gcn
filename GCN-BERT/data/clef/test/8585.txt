Step 21: preparation of sodium {trans-9-oxo-7-[1-(2-trimethylsilylethoxymethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undeca-2(6),4-dien-10-yl}sulfate (6u)
To a solution of trans-10-Hydroxy-7-[1-(2-trimethylsilylethoxymethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undeca-2(6),4-dien-9-one (6t) (0.018 g, 0.0046 mmol) in anhydrous pyridine (0.5 mL) under inert atmosphere was added sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (0.03 g, 0.185 mmol). After stirring for 16 h, the heterogeneous mixture was concentrated in vacuo. DCM was added to the residue and the solids were filtered. The crude residue was applied on a Dowex sodium form column (Dowex® 50WX8 hydrogen form stored with an aqueous solution of 2N NaOH and washed until neutral pH with water). The fractions containing the desired compound were combined, freezed and lyophilized. The salt was triturated with DCM and filtered on a PTFE filter. The filtrate was eliminated and the solid was solubilized with water MilliQ®. The aqueous layer was freezed and lyophilized to give sodium {trans-9-oxo-7-[1-(2-trimethylsilylethoxymethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undeca-2(6),4-dien-10-yl}sulfate (6u) (0.01 g, 0.020 mmol, 43%) as a white powder.
