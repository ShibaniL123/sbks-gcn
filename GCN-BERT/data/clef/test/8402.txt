In operation, the rehabilitation device 10 may be self-administered by a user 50 or the user 50 may administer the massage implement on a second person. A method of using the present invention may include the following. The rehabilitation device 10 disclosed above may be provided. The user 50 utilizing the rehabilitation device 10 may mount at least two of the plurality of rollers 40 to the modular cane 12. Because of the size and shape of the rollers 40, in certain embodiments each roller's outer contour tapers toward the other adjacent roller, the user 50 may be able to effectively conform the rehabilitation device 10 to selected areas of the body, such as but not limited to muscle groups, muscle tissue, scar tissue, tendons, trigger points and the like. Such conformity to the selected body part and between at least two of the plurality of rollers 40 enables self-administration of the rehabilitation device 10 by use of self-weight without the use of any hands, as illustrated in FIG. 1. The user 50 may roll a portion of the selected body parts under self-weight over the at least two of the plurality of rollers 40. In certain embodiments, the user may add at least one spacer 20 between the at least two of the plurality of rollers 40 to facilitate such conformity. In certain embodiments, the user 50 may self-administer by self-weight using one roller 40, such one-roller selections are illustrated in FIGS. 9 through 11. Utilization of the user's 50 self-weight under the self-administered, no-hands system disclosed above may facilitate relaxation of the applied-to muscle tissue so as to uniquely stimulate a plurality of receptors in the muscle/tendon juncture, whereby the present invention provides superior benefits. As a result, the rehabilitations device 10 may be useful in providing physiological effects known as self-myofascial release. Myofascial release alleviates muscle pain by relieving myofascial trigger points within the muscle tissue and/or by releasing lactic acid and other toxins from a person's muscle, whereby the additional benefits of the relaxation garnered by the self-administration is within the scope of the present invention. Significantly, prior art is self-applied by gripping at least one handle. In certain embodiments, a user 50 utilizing the rehabilitation device 10 may grasp one or both of the distal ends of the rehabilitation device 10 near the end caps 22, 24 and apply at least one of the rollers 40 to a body area to be rehabilitated. The user 50 can then apply force to one or more of the distal ends, so as to distribute the force of the at least one of the rollers 40 to the area to be rehabilitated. The method of the invention includes the steps of selecting the appropriate one or plurality of rollers 40 and possibly at least one spacer 20 described above and then configuring the selections in an anatomically appropriate manner to rehabilitate a selected area of the body. The rehabilitation device 10 may be easily adjusted, re-adjusted, spaced and re-spaced during one physical therapy and or rehabilitation session. Likewise, the rehabilitation device 10 may be then re-configured to the specific anatomy of a different user. The plurality of rollers 40 may address different muscle groups simultaneously. The different shapes of the rollers 40 and their ready reconfigurations along the plurality of modular canes 12 may afford varied implementations across specific anatomical locations with different needs.
