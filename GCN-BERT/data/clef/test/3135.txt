BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The invention relates to thickening vinyl copolymers, particularly hydrophobically modified alkali-swellable or alkali-soluble emulsion polymers. 2. The Related Art Rheology modifiers are used as thickeners and structurants in a variety of consumer and industrial products. They affect product performance, aesthetics, application and suspension, and delivery of active chemical agents. Rheology modifiers are generally classed in several categories dependent on the mechanism by which they thicken. Hydrodynamic thickeners work by utilizing acid groups in their structure that when neutralized form anionic charges. These repel each other causing the polymer chains to expand and entangle. Thickening and suspending effects of the neutralized polymers are due to increased physical packing of the molecules. These materials are also known as “space filling” or “volume exclusion”. Both viscosity and yield point increase with concentration. The alkali swellable emulsions (ASE) and carbomers fall within this category. Associative thickeners operate by a twin mechanism. They utilize the aforementioned hydrodynamic thickening method. Secondly, they utilize the association of hydrophobic groups on the polymer backbone with other hydrophobic species. The latter can be other hydrophobic polymer groups, oils, particles and the like. Association creates hydrophobic regions distributed throughout the polymer chain network. This also renders the polymers as effective solubilizing agents. The hydrophobically modified alkali swellable emulsions (HASE) fall into this category. HASE/ASE polymers are produced by oil-in-water emulsion polymerization. Most consist of a lightly crosslinked backbone of ethyl acrylate and methacrylic acid. U.S. Pat. No. 4,529,773 (Witiak et al.) reports alkali-soluble emulsion polymers activated by neutralization to a pH above 6.5, and subsequently acidified in the presence of a surfactant. These are described as useful thickeners in acidified containing compositions. The polymers are best formed from a 3-component monomer system of methacrylic or acrylic acid, methacrylic or acrylic acid ester of a C8-C30 alkyl or hydrocarbyl monoether of polyethylene glycol, and a C1-C4 alkyl acrylate or methacrylate. U.S. Pat. No. 7,649,047 B2 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,288,616, both to Tamareselvy et al., disclose multi-purpose alkali-swellable and alkali-soluble associative polymers. They are formed from polymerizing a monomer mixture of at least one acidic vinyl monomer, at least one nonionic vinyl monomer, a first associative monomer having a first hydrophobic end group, a second associative monomer having a second hydrophobic end group, and a crosslinking or chain transfer agent. These patents describe the HASE type chemistry. A commercial product based on this chemistry is the Lubrizol Corp. supplied Aqua SF-1®. WO 2010/026097 A1 (Graham et al.) describes rheology modifiers for use in home and personal care compositions. These modifiers are formed from four monomers. They include an amino-substituted vinyl monomer, a hydrophobic nonionic vinyl monomer (such as a C1-C30 alkyl ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid), an associative-like monomer (with a polyoxyalkylene unit end-capped with a hydrophobic group), and a further associative-like vinyl monomer. Although the aforementioned disclosures and their commercial embodiments provide rheology modifying solutions, there still is a need for improvements in thickening profile and suspension clarity. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A rheology modifier is provided which is a copolymer of formula (I) wherein a, b, c, d and e represent the percentage by weight that each repeating unit monomer is contained within the copolymer; A is a macromonomer pre-formed by catalytic chain transfer comprising at one end a polymerizable group reactive during polymerization with at least one of B, C, D and E monomers, the reactive group at the one end of the macromonomer being attached to a chain formed of a homo- or co-polymer of C1-C22 alkyl acrylates, C1-C22 alkyl methacrylates, methacrylic acid, acrylic acid and combinations thereof, the macromonomer having a number average molecular weight ranging from about 200 to about 50,000; and B is acrylic or methacrylic acid or a salt thereof; C is a C1-C8 ester of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid; D is an associative monomer of formula (II) wherein each R2 is independently H, methyl, —C(═O)OH, or —C(═O)OR3; R3 is a C1-C30 alkyl; T is —CH2C(═O)O—, —C(═O)O—, —O—, —CH2O—, —NHC(═O)NH—, —C(═O)NH—, Ar—(CE2)z-NHC(═O)O—, —Ar—(CE2)z-NHC(═O)NH—, or —CH2CH2NHC(═O)—; Ar is divalent aryl; E is H or methyl; z is 0 or 1; k is an integer in the range of 0 to 30; and m is 0 or 1; with the proviso that when k is 0, m is 0, and when k is in the range of 1 to 30; m is 1; (R4O)n is polyoxyalkylene, which is a homopolymer, a random copolymer, or a block copolymer of C2-C4-oxyalkylene units, wherein R4 is C2H4, C3H6, C4H8, or a mixture thereof, and n is an integer in the range of 5 to 250; Y is —R4O—, —R4H—, —C(═O)—, —C(═O)NH—, ═R4NHC(═O)NH—, or —C(═O)NHC(═O)—; and R5 is substituted or unsubstituted alkyl selected from the group consisting of C8-C40 linear alkyl, C8-C40 branched alkyl, C8-C40 carbocyclic alkyl, C2-C40 alkyl-substituted, phenyl, aryl-substituted C2-C40 alkyl, and C8-C80 complex ester; wherein the R5 alkyl group optionally comprises one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of hydroxy, alkoxy, and halogen; and E optionally is present as a cross linking monomer for introducing branching and controlling molecular weight, the cross linking monomer comprising polyfunctional units carrying multiple reactive fictionalisation groups selected from the group consisting of vinyl, allylic and functional mixtures thereof, the groups A, B, C, D and E being covalently bonded one to another in a random, a block, or a cross-linked copolymer format.

Example 1 Typical Catalytic Chain Transfer Polymerization Azo-isobutyronitrile (0.70 g) (AIBN) was dissolved in 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate (150 mL) and butanone (150 mL) in a 2-arm round bottomed flask fitted with a condenser. The solution was sparged with nitrogen for 45 minutes before addition of Cobaloxime Boron Fluoride (COBF) (10.3 mg). The solution was sparged with nitrogen for a further 5 minutes and the reaction mixture heated to 75° C. for 24 hours. Samples were taken periodically for conversion and molecular weight analysis using 1H NMR analysis. The resulting macromonomers were purified by removal of solvent and excess monomer in vacuo Butanone (150 mL) was added to the viscous oil and removed again in vacuo. This cycle was repeated three times to reduce residual monomer content. Associative Monomer Synthesis Brij® 35 (75 g) was dissolved in 400 ml anhydrous dichloromethane under a nitrogen atmosphere and cooled in an ice bath to 5° C. Triethylamine (10.45 g) was added via syringe. Acryloyl chloride was dispersed in 20 ml anhydrous dichloromethane and added dropwise over a 30 minute period. After complete addition the solution was allowed to warm to room temperature and the reaction stirred over night. The solution was filtered to remove precipitate and washed twice with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2×200 ml) and once with saturated brine (200 ml). The product was dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered and further dried in vacuo. Typical HASE Polymer Synthesis A round bottom flask was charged with ethyl acrylate (25.8 g), methacrylic acid (17.6 g), Brij® 35 surfmer (4.28 g), trimethylolpropane triacrylate (0.14 g) and 30% sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) solution (1.57 g). The mixture was sealed and purged with nitrogen for 30 minutes before adding deoxygenated water (12.2 g) and stirring into a pre-emulsion. A multineck round bottom flask was fitted with a nitrogen sparge and overhead stirrer. Deoxygenated water (85.5 g) and 30% SDS solution (0.48 g) were added, stirred at 250 rpm and heated to 85° C. Ammonium persulfate (0.034 g) in water (1 ml) was added via syringe. The pre-emulsion was fed into the surfactant solution via peristaltic pump over 60 minutes. After complete addition the temperature was increased to 95° C. and ammonium persulfate (0.015 g) in water (1 ml) was added and the reaction stirred for a further 90 minutes. Example 2 A series of copolymers were prepared using the typical HASE polymer synthesis outlined at the end of the preceding Example. Table I details a series of polymers using different macromonomers and varying other components. The Table lists the actives in grams based on 100 grams of emulsion for the HASE synthesis. Not listed is water (which ranges from 77 to 68%) and the active SDS emulsifier and ammonium persulfate. Preparation of Formulations Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate (160.71 g) was dissolved in water (1106.25 g) aided by mixing with an overhead stirrer. To the solution was added the copolymer solution (60 ml), Kathon CG/ICP II (1.5 ml) and finally Tegobetaine® CK KB 5 (125.00 g). The solution was split into 145 ml aliquots from which base formulations I, II, III and IV were made up as follows: Formulation I (pH 5.9, 0.68% NaCl): An overhead stirrer was used to mix an aliquot (145 g) of the base solution.

Sodium chloride (2.25 g) was slowly added and topped with further water (2.75 g). Formulation III (pH 6.75, 0.68% NaCl): An overhead stirrer was used to mix an aliquot (145 g) of the base solution. The pH was adjusted to pH 6.75 using sodium hydroxide (0.1 M). Sodium chloride (1.125 g) was slowly added and topped with further water (3.875 g). Formulation IV (pH 6.75, 1.58% NaCl): An overhead stirrer was used to stir an aliquot (145 g) of the base solution. The pH was adjusted to pH 6.75 using sodium hydroxide (0.1 M). Sodium chloride (2.25 g) was slowly added and topped with further water (2.75 g). Clarity Measurements Clarity was measured using a SpectraMax Microplate Spectrophotometer for UV/VIS absorbance measurements at 420 nm. Nunc Nuclon D microtitre plates with well capacity of 200 microliters were used for the measurements. Each well was loaded with 150 microliters of sample and four wells were used for each sample with an average value being taken. The value for demineralized water was then deducted from the sample value and the following clarity ranges were applied: Clear (transparent) is defined as 0 to 0.2 absorbance. Haze (translucency) is defined as 0.21 to 0.9 absorbance. Opaque is defined as at least 0.91 absorbance. Viscosity Measurements An Anton Paar ASC32 Rheometer was used to measure viscosity.

These copolymers are all characterized by having a viscosity of at least 35 Pa·s in strongly salified (1.58% sodium chloride) aqueous systems both at pH 5.9 and 6.75. For purposes of adequate thickening, the range of viscosity in the 1.58% salified aqueous systems at pH 5.9 and 6.75 should range from 35 to 250, preferably from 45 to 130 Pa·s. In Samples B, C, D, E, K, L, M and Q, the copolymers do not contain Brij® Surfiner. These have at least one viscosity below 35 Pa·s at either pH 5.9 or pH 6.75 or both under 1.58% salt water systems. A further important property of copolymers under the invention is good clarity. The copolymers at pH 5.9 and 6.75, and at 0.68% and 1.58% salt levels, must provide at least translucent (not opaque) formulations. Samples A, F, G, H, I, J, N, O and P meet the translucency requirement. By contrast, Samples B, D, E, K, L, M and Q have at least one opaque formulation.
