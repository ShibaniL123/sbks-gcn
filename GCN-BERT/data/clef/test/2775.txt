Title A dampening system for a shoe Field The invention relates to a spring device or dampening system for a shoe, especially a high-heeled shoe, and a shoe comprising the spring device or dampening system. In particular, the invention relates to a spring-loaded assembly for a shoe. Background There are many different types of shoes for use in many different types of activities, for example, day-to-day walking shoes, fashion shoes, high-heeled shoes, assembly shoes, athletic shoes and hiking shoes. When walking, a person exerts a large force on the heel of the foot (the hind-foot) and the ball of the foot (the mid-foot). This pressure results in a high level of shock being experienced by the foot through to the lower back. Many shoes have been designed to dampen such shock to the user, resulting in a mass market for comfortable and shock- absorbent shoes. The problem arising from shoes in general is that the changes in foot shape and length in the action of walking are not addressed. Footwear where any kind of height is applied, particularly in the heel region, gives rigidity to the shoe. The introduction of a rigid structure to a shoe results in a change in the mechanics of the shoe, thereby losing such qualities as utility, ease of wear and prolonged use without fatigue. Protective work boots, hiking shoes/boots, ice skates, inline skates and regular roller skates are also constructed with a rigid structure, thus restricting movement of the feet when free motion is in greatest demand. There is a shoe described in US Patent Application No. 10/771,156 (hereinafter referred to as the Ί56 application) which relates to adjustment of the spring properties of shoes, and in particular running/athletic shoes. Broadly, the product of the invention disclosed in the Ί56 application involves a shoe with a midsole comprising a bottom plate composed of two parts. More specifically, the Ί56 application teaches that the bottom plate is formed of two parts, namely a rear foot bottom plate (at the heel portion) and a forefoot bottom plate (at the front foot portion). The two parts are articulated to the base body (equivalent to the shoes heel) of the shoe by means of a hinge at an articulation point. The articulation point lies roughly in the area of the metatarsal bone. In use, when the wearer of the shoe exerts a downward force the two parts of the base body can pivot relative to the base body. The pivoting of the two parts is determined by springs which are located between heel and the two parts of the base body. In addition, the Ί56 application discusses means to either prevent/limit or encourage lateral movement of the base body with respect to forefoot bottom plate in response to a relative change of the length of the base body and bottom plate when a foot rolls during use. The problem with the shoe described in the Ί56 application is that the real and natural movement of the foot remains unaddressed. Although a spring motion has been introduced to the shoe, and regardless of the insole material used, structural rigidity in the shoe remains. US Patent document 3,142,910 A (Beth Levine) describes improvements in the sole structure of a shoe by maintaining contact of a portion of the shoe with the sole of the foot of the wearer and elevating portions of the shoe in differing degrees during the walking process. The document also describes a shoe with a heel-follower structure which is in constant contact with the arch and heel of the wearer. The device of US Patent 3,142,910 A comprises a spring member composed of two elements for raising the shank and heel of the shoe into contact with the wearer during use and maintains a constant pressure against the arch and heel of the wearer during use. The problem with the shoe described in the Levine document is that the device interferes with the traditional structure of a shoe and thus affects the integrity, balance and comfort of a shoe. The device described in Levine alters the height of different portions of the shoe and requires a spring member to ensure that maintain the sole of the shoe in constant contact with the sole of the wearer. It is an object of the present invention to overcome at least one of the above-mentioned problems. Summary of the Invention According to the present invention there is provided, as set out in the appended claims, a spring device or dampening system or an assembly (1) for use in a shoe, the device or system or assembly (1) comprising: a leaf spring (2) adapted to be malleable to the contours of a foot; and a support frame (or insole structure) (3) configured to accommodate the leaf spring (2) and accommodate the foot; wherein the leaf spring (2) is configured to connect the assembly (1) to a heel (42) of a shoe by a securing means (6) and wherein the assembly (1) is adapted to further comprise a void (or gap or space) (5) between the support frame (or insole structure) (3) and the heel (42). The leaf spring (2) and the support frame (3) interplay and cooperate with each other to create a dampening effect in the void or space (5) between them. The term "leaf spring" should be understood to mean a thin and tapering piece of metal or alloy, which has a high yield strength. The high yield strength allows the leaf spring to return to their original shape despite significant bending or twisting. Typically, the leaf spring is constructed from spring steel (a low-alloy, medium-carbon steel or high- carbon steel with a very high yield strength), carbon fiber, metal, polymer, or an organic micro lattice, wood from species with particular flexible or elastic or spring properties (for example, ash, willow and yew), or (re-enforced) glass fiber, or other suitable materials with similar properties to those listed. In the specification, the term "assembly" should be understood to mean a platform, a spring device, a dampening system or a structure which fits into the existing construction of shoe-making (or forms the basis around which a shoe may be produced). The terms "assembly", "spring device" and "dampening system" may be used interchangeably. The assembly as used herein represents the skeleton or framework upon which the generic parts of a shoe, for example, the upper, the outer sole and the heel, are attached to form a shoe. In the specification, it should be understood that the terms "shoe", "boot" and "footwear" can be used interchangeably with each other, and may be selected from, but not limited to, a high-heel shoe, a sports shoe, an athletic shoe, a low-mid heeled shoe, a hiking shoe, a roller-skate shoe, an in-line roller skate shoe, a skateboard shoe, a protective work boot, a ski boot, a snowboarding boot, a defense-forces boot, aeronautical footwear, robotic feet and footwear, energy-producing footwear, and an assembly shoe. The assembly acts as a shock absorbing or dampening system when in use in a shoe, utilizing the spring-like properties of the leaf spring component of the assembly. In the specification, the term "void" should be understood to mean a gap or a space between top of the heel of the shoe (which is attached to the leaf spring 2) and the support frame (insole structure 3) of the shoe. The terms "support frame" and "insole structure", means a typical insole, which generally encases a shank spring, and should be understood to mean the same thing and may be used interchangeably throughout the specification. The "support frame" or "insole" is generally made of a single layer or multiple layers of fiber-board, or layers of compressed paper, which encase the shank spring. Typically, the leaf spring (2) is used in conjunction with a shank spring (see Figure 2A, for example). In one embodiment, the leaf spring (2) is a single piece comprising a front section (4) adapted to accommodate the forefoot and a hind or heel section (7) adapted to accommodate the hind-foot. In one embodiment, the support frame (3) is also comprised of a continuous piece of material comprising a front section (4a) adapted to accommodate the forefoot and a heel section (7a) adapted to accommodate the hind-foot and the heel (42) of the shoe. In one embodiment, the thickness of the leaf spring (2) is tapered in a direction from the heel section (7) to the front section (4). Preferably, the leaf spring (2) tapers from between about 2 to 5mm at the heel section (7) to between about 0.25mm to 0.75mm at the front section (4). Ideally, the leaf spring (2) tapers from a thickness of 2mm at the heel section (7) to 0.5mm at the front section (4). The thickness of the leaf spring (2) depends on materials used. For example, in a typical high-heeled shoe, the tapering of the insole is widely varied but in almost all cases it is safe to say that it tapers in one direction only, i.e. it is thicker at the heel section (7a) and thinner at the front section (4a) (because it needs to bend more). The type of material used determines how thick it can be (for example, 2mm of spring steel is too thick to be straightened comfortably by the joint of the foot). As such, the person skilled in the art would determine from the type of material being used and the type of shoe being made, the thickness and tapering thickness required of the insole (which would include the assembly (1) described herein). In one embodiment, the leaf spring (2) is secured to a top portion (43) of the heel (42) by the securing means (6). The securing means (6) may also be used to secure the leaf spring (2) to the support frame (3). In one embodiment, the securing means (6) comprises any means known to the skilled person, such as for example, a screw, a nail, a tack, a pin, a bolt, glue, or any suitable fixing agent or method used in the field of shoe making. More methods for securing the leaf spring (2) to the support frame or insole structure (3, 30) include interlocking, intertwining, splicing, latticing, stapling, welding, soldering, or bracing. It can be secured by, but not limited to, the securing means at the mid-section (6a) or front section (4a). Preferably, the securing means (6, 6b) secures the leaf spring (2) at the front section (4a). In one embodiment, a portion (2a) of the leaf spring (2) is adapted to grip a lower portion (44) of the heel (42) and acts as the securing means (6). Preferably, the leaf spring (2) is sprung steel. The support frame (3) is typically fiber board or layered, compressed paper. Typically, the support frame (3) is reinforced by a steel shank spring. In one embodiment, the leaf spring (2) is enveloped (or lined or wrapped or encased or fitted) with a sleeve (90). The sleeve (90) may act as a protective layer and/or a cushioning layer over the leaf spring (2). Preferably, the sleeve (90) may be made from any suitable material such as, for example, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), foam, polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane, poly-chloroprene, a viscoelastic polymer (for example, amorphous polymers, semi-crystalline polymers, biopolymers), putty, an air-filled plastic bubble, sponge, organic or other cushioning materials. The application of a sleeve (90) would create a more stream-lined leaf spring (2) in the assembly (1) which would be easily retro fittable into current shoe manufacturing production lines. Access to securing means (6) in the leaf spring (2) would always be open so as to secure the leaf spring (2) to the top portion (43) of the heel (42) or the support frame (3). In one embodiment, the void (5) is substantially filled with a material (80). Preferably, the material (80) is a shock-absorbing material. Preferably, the material (80) is selected from the group comprising various types of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), foam, polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane, poly-chloroprene, a viscoelastic polymer (for example, amorphous polymers, semi-crystalline polymers, biopolymers), putty, an air-filled plastic bubble, a sprung panel, an encapsulated rubber ball, sponge, organic or other cushioning materials. Ideally, the material (80) conforms substantially to the shape of the void (5). In one embodiment, the front section (4, 4a) can further comprise at least one aperture (10). The advantage of the aperture (10) in the front section (4, 4a) is to provide a more organic feel to the movement of the foot when wearing a shoe comprising the assembly or device (1). The user receives improved sensory feedback when the forefoot makes contact with a surface while wearing a shoe comprising the assembly or device (1). In one embodiment, the assembly (1) further comprises a shank spring (12). Preferably, the shank spring (12) comprises wings on either side. The shank spring (12) is typically located within the structure of the support frame (3). In one embodiment of the present invention the assembly (1) or spring device or dampening system may replace the traditional spring shank (12) component in the support frame (3) of the shoe. In one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an assembly or spring device or dampening system (100) for use in a shoe comprising: a leaf spring (20) adapted to be malleable to the contours of a foot; and a support frame (or insole structure) (30) configured to accommodate the leaf spring (20) and accommodate the foot; wherein the leaf spring (20) further comprises a front section (22) adapted to accommodate a forefoot and a mid-foot, and a heel section (70) configured to accommodate a hind-foot; wherein the front section (22) and the heel section (70) are linked by a connecting means (60), wherein the heel section (70) further comprises a heel connecting portion (70a) and a heel supporting portion (70b), the heel connecting portion 70(a) is adapted to attach to the heel (42) of the shoe and the heel supporting portion (70b) is configured to accommodate the hind-foot. In one embodiment, the assembly (100) is adapted to further comprise a void (or gap or space) (5) between the support frame (or insole/insole structure) (30) and the heel (42). Ideally, the void (5) is formed between the heel connecting portion (70a) and the heel supporting portion (70b). In one embodiment, the void (5) is substantially filled with a material (80). Preferably, the material (80) is a shock-absorbing material. Preferably, the material is selected from the group comprising various types of foam, polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane, poly-chloroprene, a viscoelastic polymer (for example, amorphous polymers, semi-crystalline polymers, biopolymers), putty, an air-filled plastic bubble, a sprung panel, an encapsulated rubber ball, sponge, organic or other cushioning materials. Ideally, the material (80) conforms substantially to the shape of the void (5). In one embodiment, the front section (22) is configured to be substantially U-shaped, substantially V-shaped, substantially W-shaped or substantially M- or N-shaped. Ideally, the front section (22) is configured to be substantially U-shaped. In one embodiment, the front section (22) rests in a groove (45) in the support frame (30). Preferably, the groove (45) follows the circumference of the front section (22). In one embodiment, the connecting means (60) is accommodated in a channel (65) in the support frame (30). In one embodiment, the connecting means (60) traverses from one side of the support frame (30) to the opposite side of the support frame (30). In one embodiment, the support frame (30) further comprises a cavity (35) defining a foot bed (50) of the shoe and configured to accommodate a cushioning means for the mid-foot. In one embodiment, the cushioning means may comprise a shock absorbent material such as foam, putty, an air-filled plastic bubble or a sprung panel. In one embodiment, the assembly (1, 100) also comprises a sleeve (90) which can partly or wholly envelop (or line or encase or wrap around) the leaf spring (2, 20). The sleeve (90) may act as a protective layer and/or a cushioning layer over the leaf spring (2, 20). Preferably, the sleeve (90) may be made from any suitable material such as, for example, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), foam, polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane, poly-chloroprene, a viscoelastic polymer (for example, amorphous polymers, semi-crystalline polymers, biopolymers), putty, an air-filled plastic bubble, sponge, organic or other cushioning materials. The application of a sleeve (90) would create a more stream-lined leaf spring (2, 20) in the assembly (1, 100) which would be easily retrofittable into current shoe manufacturing production lines. Access to securing means (6) in the leaf spring (2, 20) would always be open so as to secure the leaf spring (20) to the top portion (43) of the heel (42) or the support frame (3, 30). The assembly (1, 100) may also further comprise an upper lining layer (92), which can be placed over and on top of the leaf spring (2, 20), whether the sleeve (90) is partly or wholly enveloping (lining or encasing or wrapping around) the leaf spring (2, 20). The upper lining layer (92) is generally constructed from the same material as the sleeve (90) or the cushioning material (80) used to fill the void (5). In one embodiment, the sleeve (90) partly or wholly envelopes the leaf spring (2, 20), the heel connecting portion (70a) and the heel supporting portion (70b). In one embodiment, the sleeve (90) partly or wholly envelopes the leaf spring (2, 20), the heel connecting portion (70a), the heel supporting portion (70b) and void (5). In one embodiment, the sleeve (90) partly or wholly envelopes the leaf spring (2, 20), the heel connecting portion (70a), the heel supporting portion (70b) and the foot bed 50. In one embodiment, the support frame (3, 30) is further configured to act as a support base for the leaf spring (2, 20). In a further embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a shoe comprising the assembly (1, 100) as described herein. In one embodiment, the shoe may be selected from, but not limited to, a high-heeled shoe, a sports shoe, an athletic shoe, a low-mid heeled shoe, a hiking shoe, a roller-skate shoe, an in-line roller skate shoe, a skateboard shoe, a protective work boot, a ski boot, a snowboarding boot, a defense-forces boot, aeronautical footwear, robotic feet and footwear, energy-producing footwear, and an assembly shoe. In one embodiment, the heel (42) may feature a compression spring located in a hollowed out upper portion of the heel (42). An additional benefit to a user standing in an idle position wearing a shoe comprising the assembly or device (1, 100) of the present invention is that the weight and pressure of the user exerted downward and through the feet of the user is released through the assembly or device (1, 100). The cushioning properties of the assembly or device (1, 100) described in the above embodiments provides the user with the experience of tension- and stress-relief on the feet. In one embodiment, there is provided an assembly (1, 100) for use in a shoe, the assembly (1) comprising a leaf spring (2, 20) adapted to be malleable to the contours of a foot; and a support frame (3, 30) configured to accommodate the leaf spring (2, 20) and accommodate the foot; wherein the leaf spring (2, 20) is configured to connect the assembly (1, 100) to a heel (42) of a shoe by a securing means (6) and wherein the assembly (1, 100) is adapted to further comprise a void (5) between the support frame (3, 30) and the heel (42). In one embodiment, the leaf spring (20) further comprises a front section (22) adapted to accommodate a forefoot and a mid-foot and a back section (70) configured to accommodate a hind-foot; wherein the front section (22) and the heel section (70) are linked by a connecting means (60). In one embodiment, the heel section (70) further comprises a heel connecting portion (70a) and a heel supporting portion (70b), the heel connecting portion 70(a) is adapted to attach to the heel (42) of the shoe and the heel supporting portion (70b) is configured to accommodate the hind-foot. In one embodiment, the device (1, 100) may also comprise an outer upper heel portion (420) fixed to the heel (42) of the shoe. The outer upper heel portion (420) is rigid and is fixed to the heel (42) at the point where the leaf spring (2, 20) is attached to the heel (42). Preferably, the device (1, 100) further comprises an inner upper heel portion (440) nestled within the outer upper heel portion (420), which is provides a "heel within a heel" section. As there is a cavity between the outer upper heel portion (420) and the heel (42) caused by the void (5), the inner heel portion (440) can move up and down separately and independently from the outer heel portion (420). The ability of the inner upper heel portion (440) to move independently solves any potential friction problem and pain associated with wearing any shoe with a rigid heel surround. One of the advantages of the present invention is that it comprises a single component (the assembly or device 1, 100), which extends from the heel (42) to the front section (sole) (4a) of a shoe. The single component covers the two points of load bearing. The two points of perpendicular weight applied to a shoe in use are fixed at the heel (42) and at the front section (sole) (4a) (where the ball portion of the foot meets the shoe). The positioning of the device (1, 100) of the present invention in a shoe ensures that the arch of the foot of the user is in the correct position on the device (1, 100). The leaf spring (2, 20), which extends from the heel (42) to the front section (4a) of the shoe, covers the two load bearing points. This means that the heel (42) and the front section (4a) of the device (1, 100) can never separate and the device (1, 100) acts as a lever (Moment Formula). The positioning of the device (1, 100) in a shoe guarantees flexibility, and qualifies as a true fully functional shock absorber, giving equal and opposite forces along the length and breadth of the shoe. However, to attain these advantages, the leaf spring (2) does not necessarily have to extend the entire length of the shoe. It provides the wearer of a shoe comprising the present invention with increased stability, comfort and balance when in use. A shoe comprising the device (1, 100) of the invention retains the rigid structure of a traditional shoe upper attached to the insole, with the movement of the shoe structure occurring between the insole and the claimed device (the mid- sole), which is securely attached to the heel of the shoe. The claimed invention does not interfere with the existing traditional structure of a shoe. The movement of the foot during walking is supported by the sole structure incorporating the claimed invention, but it is not in constant contact with the sole of the foot, nor does it need to be to convey the increased stability, comfort and balance of the user. The claimed invention does not alter the heights of different portions of the shoe (for example, the heel section), but creates a space in the mid-sole section towards the heel of the shoe, to allow for increased movement/flexibility and easing of any tension in the foot of the wearer caused by the heel strike during walking (or running). Brief Description of the Drawings The invention will be more clearly understood from the following description of an embodiment thereof, given by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:- Figure 1A and Figure IB illustrate a side view and plan view, respectively, of one embodiment of the assembly of the present invention; Figure 2A to D illustrate a side view (A and C), an elevation view (B) and perspective view (D) of the assembly of Figure 1 A or IB encapsulated in a shoe; Figure 3A to D illustrate side (A), detailed perspective (B), rear perspective (C) and plan (D) of a further embodiment of the assembly of the present invention; Figure 4A and Figure 4B illustrate an exploded view and side view, respectively, of the assembly of the present invention, while Figure 4Ca, Figure 4Cb and Figure 4D illustrate a sleeve enveloping the leaf spring element of the assembly without a void- filling material, with a void-filling material, and the assembly , respectively, of the present invention; and Figure 5 illustrates a front view and perspective view of the void foam filler component. Figure 6A illustrates a plan view and Figure 6B illustrates a side view of an alternative embodiment of the assembly of the present invention. Figure 7 to 10 illustrates a number of alternative embodiments of the assembly of the present invention. Detailed Description of the Drawings The present invention uses the spring properties and/or the shock absorbing/dampening properties of spring steel (or another similar material) to encourage lateral movement of a shoe assembly as described herein. Figures 1 to 3 illustrate an assembly or device of the present invention, hereinafter referred to by reference numeral 1. The assembly 1 comprises a leaf spring 2 and a support frame or insole structure 3. The support frame 3 is generally one commonly used in footwear manufacturing. There is generally a void or gap or space 5 between the support frame 3 and a heel 42 of a shoe when in use. The heel 42 is attached to the support frame 3 by the leaf spring 2. The leaf spring 2 is a single piece of material comprising a front section 4 and a heel section 7, with the former adapted to accommodate the forefoot and the latter adapted to accommodate the heel of a foot (the hind foot) and the heel of the shoe (see Figure IB). The leaf spring 2 is tapered from the heel section 7 towards to the front section 4 and generally conforms to the contours of a foot (Figure 1A). Similarly, the support frame 3 is also comprised of a continuous piece of material including a back portion 3a comprising a heel section 7a adapted to accommodate the hind-foot and the heel 42 of a shoe. The support frame 3 further comprises a front section 4a adapted to accommodate the forefoot. The support frame 3 typically encases a shank spring 12 to aid in stabilizing a shoe utilizing the assembly 1. Where a shank spring 12 is present, it is generally located within the structure of the support frame 3 (see Figure 2A) or a support frame 30 (see Figure 4D). . The shank spring 12 is commonly used in shoe-making to provide stabilization and to support the arch of the foot, especially in high heeled shoes. In a typical high heeled shoe or often in a platform shoe, the shank spring 12 may have a wider surface profile and extra fixing holes in the support frame 3, 30 to further aid stabilization. In the present invention a person skilled in the art may opt to add wings to widen the shank- spring 12 at the metatarsal (forward) end to achieve more stabilization. The dampening function is achieved by the inter-play between the leaf spring 2 and the support structure 3,30, where the space created between the leaf spring 2 and support frame 3 (a void 5, see below), provides the leaf spring 2 with sufficient room to flex when pressure is applied and return to its resting (biased) position when the pressure is lifted from it. The leaf spring 2 is secured to a top portion 43 of the heel 42 by a securing means 6. The leaf spring 2 is also secured to the support frame 3 by a securing means 6a. The securing means 6, 6a are generally those know to the skilled person, such as, for example, a screw, a nail, a tack, a pin, a bolt, glue, or any suitable fixing agent or fixing method used in the field of shoe making. As illustrated in Figure 3A-3C, a portion 2a of the leaf spring 2 is adapted to grip a lower portion 44 of the heel 42. The lower portion 2a of the leaf spring 2 acts the securing means 6 in this instance, and fixes the device to the heel, while the securing means 6a secures the leaf spring 2 to the support frame 3. A void (or gap or space) 5 is created between the heel portion 7a of the support frame 3 and the top portion 43 of the heel 42. The void 5 can remain unfilled or can be filled with a material 80 suitable as a shock-absorbing material (Figures 2 and 3). The void 5 is necessary in facilitating the dampening function as it allows compression of the heel 42 toward the support frame 3 without making physical contact with the support frame 3. The contact between the heel 42 and the support frame 3 is prevented by adding the material 80 to fill the void 5. The various materials 80 at the disposal of the shoe-maker for use to fill the void 5 have the capacity to provide different resistances to the shoe, as each material 80 with have different properties allowing different resistances according to their density, thickness, length, width, and distance from their fixing point etc. The material 80 generally is suitable as a shock-absorbing material. The material(s) 80 for use in filling the void 5 can be either foams, sponge, elastic polymers, organic materials and so on as mentioned above. These types of material(s) 80 will also have varying properties and qualities of resistance, dampening etc. A person skilled in the art will arrange and match the preferred material 80 according to preference, for example, a preference for a denser foam would give less bounce and more stiffness to a shoe, while less dense foam would give more bounce and increased sensation for the user. The type of material 80 used is the designer's choice. However, it is important that the material choice supports the dampening function of the spring device, with comfort as its overall result. The void 5 may also be left free of any material 80 and become an aesthetical design feature of the shoe, while maintaining the dampening function of the leaf spring 2 and comfort to the user. The front section 4 of the leaf spring 2 can also have one or more apertures 10 (see Figure IB, for example). The aperture(s) 10 provide a more flexible movement in the assembly 1, providing the user with a more organic experience when wearing a shoe comprising the assembly 1. The apertures 10 can be any shape and when a plurality of apertures 10 are used, any pattern can be utilized (see Figure IB). The apertures 10 punched out or cut out of the front section 4 of the leaf spring 2 are not essential to the functioning of the leaf spring 2 when the front section 4 is flat as opposed to being concaved. The aperture(s) 10 may serve to reduce the weight of the assembly 1 where weight may be a concern. The aperture(s) 10 also allow for superior adhesion to be achieved as the front section 4 is attached to the support frame 3. In use, the assembly 1 has a multiplicity of functions. On the initial impact of the heel 42 with the ground or a surface, the support frame 3 moves downwards through the void 5 towards the heel section 7 of the leaf spring 2. The movement of the support frame 3 toward the heel section 7 may be cushioned by the material 80. As the weight of the wearer progresses through the step to the plantar position, the dampening or shock- absorbing action of the assembly 1 returns the heel of the foot to its original elongated position. Meanwhile, as the ball of the foot contacts the ground, the front section 4 is activated, reacting in a controlled manner to the movement of the foot and resisting the foot's push to the ground, therefore dampening this portion of the person's step. If the front section 4 is to be shaped, the front section 4 can be slotted or grooved at the side. The shape of the front section 4 may be arranged to compliment the toes individually or as a group. A 'slotted' or 'grooved' front section 4 allows controlled compression not just in the direction of the step, but in multiple directions (see Figure IB). The advantage of having a grooved or slotted front section 4 is to maintain the natural sensing function of the toes. Referring to Figures 4A and 4B, there is illustrated a further embodiment of the assembly of the present invention, in which parts described with reference to the previous embodiment are assigned the same numerals, hereinafter referred to by reference numeral 100. Figure 4A illustrates a side view of the assembly 100, which comprises a leaf spring 20 and a support frame 30. The support frame 30 is generally one commonly used in footwear manufacturing. There is generally a void 5 between the support frame 30 and a heel 42 of a shoe when in use. The heel 42 is attached to the support frame 30 by the leaf spring 20 via the top 43 of the heel 42. The leaf spring 20 comprises a substantially U-shaped front section 22 adapted to accommodate a forefoot and a mid-foot and a heel section 70 configured to accommodate a hind-foot. The front section 22 and the heel section 70 are linked by a connecting means 60. The connecting means 60 generally traverses from one side of the support frame 30 to the opposite side of the support frame 30 through a channel 65 arranged therein. The connecting means 60 is generally positioned in the support frame 30 where, when in use in a shoe, the connecting means 60 is juxtaposed where the metatarsals of the foot begin. The connecting means 60 is generally a bar or a rod- shaped connector. The heel section 70 further comprises a heel connecting portion 70a and a heel supporting portion 70b; the heel connecting portion 70a being adapted to attach to the heel 42 of the shoe and the heel supporting portion 70b being configured to accommodate and support the hind-foot. The heel connecting portion 70a being positioned beneath the heel supporting portion 70b. The shape of the heel section 70 creates or accommodates the curve of the arch of the foot. If the shoe is to be a high-heeled shoe, the heel section 70 is curved to configure with the height of the heel 42 of the shoe. If the shoe is flat-heeled, then the heel section 70 will be curved such that the curve matches the height of the heel 42. The heel section 70 and heel connecting portion 70a are adapted to be secured to the connecting means 60. The heel supporting portion 70b can be constructed of a more rigid or thicker spring steel or similar material to reinforce the shape of the structure under the heel section 70. The front section 22 and heel section 70 may be composed of the same strong yet flexible material, which could be varied in shape for example a flat wire. Various degrees of flexibil ity and strength required depends on the thickness of the material used to make the leaf spring 2, 20. The configuration of the assembly 100 described herein facilitates this interplay of flexibility and strength, resulting in a dual dampening effect. The front section 22 is configured to accommodate the joint of the foot and forms a foot bed 50 of the shoe. The front section 22 rests in a groove 45 of the support frame 30, which follows a contour of the foot bed 50. The foot bed 50 further comprises a cavity 35, which is configured to accept a cushioning means for the mid-foot. The support frame 30 is typically composed of a combination of stiff and yielding materials that are commonly used in the construction of soling materials in the shoe- making industry. The support frame 30 may be comprised of various materials, the most common being fiber board, which is a layered compressed paper bonded under high pressure and often included are fabric layers either loosely or tightly woven. Located between the paper layers at the arch of the foot is the shank spring 12. The shank spring 12 is generally attached to the layers by glue and features protrusions or rivets at either end, which bond the entire support frame 30 together. Further support frames 30 which can appear in shoes are leather sections sewn or stuck together, rubber, wood, cork, fiber glass, polyvinyl acetate (PVA), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) foam (which may be combined with more rigid plastic structures), or any other suitable material. The combination of materials used is determined by the flexibility or rigidity required in different areas of the shoe, for example, the joint of the foot and in the area between the leaf spring 2, 20 to the rear and over the heel. In one embodiment, as illustrated in Figure 4Ca, Figure 4Cb and Figure 4D, the leaf spring 20 is enveloped with a sleeve 90. The sleeve 90 can be constructed of foam or plastic or another suitably protective and flexible material; or alternatively it could be injection molded, or it could be selected from cushioning material such as those which of material 80, for example a foam filler (such as ethylene vinyl acetate). As shown in Figure 4Ca, the sleeve (90) envelopes the leaf spring 20, the heel connecting portion 70a, the heel supporting portion 70b, yet leaves the void 5 open. In Figures 4B, 4Cb and 4D, the sleeve 90 is generally wrapped around the back of the heel area of a shoe, covering the void 5 and following the contours of the shoe comprising the assembly 1, 100. In Figure 4B, there is illustrated an upper lining layer 92, which is placed over and on top of the sleeve 90-enveloped leaf spring 20. The upper lining layer 92 is generally constructed from the same material as the sleeve 90 or the cushioning material 80 used to fill the void 5. It should be noted that the leaf spring 2, 20 can also be enveloped partly with the sleeve 90. If the support frame 30 comprises the leaf spring 20 and foot bed 50, and is injection molded with two or more different materials, then the heel section 70 and foot bed 50 could be enveloped entirely in the sleeve 90. In this manner, the heel section 70 and foot bed 50 could be seen to act as a skeleton structure within the sleeve 90, acting as a support framework around which the assembly 1, 100 is constructed (see Figure 4B). For example, a mold of the support frame 30 can be injected with a minimum of two materials, (i) a lighter A20-A30 shore EVA for the joint at the sole of the shoe and between the heel connecting portion 70a and the heel supporting portion 70b, and (ii) a more rigid A40 or higher shore EVA for the rest of the shoe structure. The heel section 70 and leaf spring 2, 20 can take any shape, such as, for example, flat, round or triangular. The shape of the heel section 70 (or leaf spring 2, 20) is not relevant to the function of the invention, so long as the heel section 70 (or leaf spring 2, 20) possesses the spring/memory properties of the material which are required to provide the dampening effect. Figure 5 illustrates a front view and perspective view of one example of a void-filling component 80a composed of material 80. The shape of the void-filling component 80a can take the shape required or proposed by the shape of the void 5 presented by each shoe. When the component 80a is positioned in the void 5 and between the heel connecting portion 70a and the heel supporting portion 70b, the component 80a is configured to accommodate the heel supporting portion 70b. The embodiments described herein work on a similar principle to a sprung mattress where a wire frame re-enforces, aids and supports the return of its form after weight is removed; that is, it is biased to be in an uncompressed state. The term spring leaf 2, 20 provides a resistance to a force applied to the assembly 1, 100. The tension of the leaf spring 2, 20 provides this resistance which can be modified by varying the thickness of the leaf spring 2, 20, that is, the thicker the leaf spring 2, 20 in diameter the greater the resistance is produced. In a further embodiment, it is possible that the heel 42 may feature a compression spring located in the hollowed out upper portion of the traditional stiletto or high heel. In order to contain movement other than the intended vertical compression, the spring may be encased in a molded tubular section composed of an outer upper cylindrical section molded or fixed to the underside of the heel bed and an inner matching cylindrical section molded or fixed into the hollow portion at the top of the stiletto heel. In referring to Figure 6, there is illustrated a further embodiment of the invention in which parts described with reference to the previous embodiments are assigned the same reference numerals. In the embodiment, the leaf spring 2 is a single piece of material comprising the front section 4 and the heel section 7, with the former adapted to accommodate the forefoot and the latter adapted to accommodate the heel of a foot (the hind foot) and the heel of the shoe (see Figure 6A). The leaf spring 2 is secured to the top portion 43 of the heel 42 by the securing means 6. The leaf spring 2 is also secured to the support frame 3 by a securing means 6b. The securing means 6, 6b are generally those know to the skilled person, such as, for example, a screw, a nail, a tack, a pin, a bolt, glue, or any suitable fixing agent or fixing method used in the field of shoe making. The securing means 6b is generally located in the front section 4 of the leaf spring 2 where it secures the leaf spring 2 to the support frame 3 (see Figure 6B). The securing means 6b can also be used to secure the leaf spring 20 of Figures 4A, 4B, 4Ca, 4Cb and 4D to the frame. In an alternative embodiment, the leaf spring 20 is constructed from a single piece of material. In use, pressure is applied to the heel 42 of a shoe comprising the assembly 100 as described above as the wearer of the shoe places their foot on the ground heel first. When pressure is applied to the shoe comprising the assembly 1, 100, a force is exerted on the heel 42 of the shoe, which is attached to the heel connecting portion 70a of the assembly 1, 100. The force applied to the heel connecting portion 70a moves up towards the heel supporting portion 70b through the void 5, and compresses or narrows the distance between the heel supporting portion 70b and the heel connecting portion 70a. The cushioning material 80 making up the void-filling component 80a absorbs the impact of the force exerted on it and becomes compressed (opposite to its biased expanded position). As the foot moves downwards into the step (towards the plantar position) the force travels down to the ball of the foot, and the weight travels through a point of even distribution before pressure is applied to the toes and released as the step follows through toe-off position. At the same time, pressure is released on the cushioning material 80 in the void 5, which returns to its biased expanded position, thus opening up the void 5 as the user prepares for the next step. Turning now to Figure 7, there is illustrated a further embodiment of the invention that is similar to Figure 6a except this embodiment comprises an integrated or inner heel portion 400 designed to be integral with the leaf spring 4 or as a single unit. An outer face of the heel 400 is designed to cooperate or attach with the heel of a shoe 401, as shown in Figure 8, thus minimizing any friction. The inner face of the heel 400 fits snugly around a wearers' heel in use. In effect a double heel is created. It will be appreciated that the inner heel portion 400 and the outer fixed heel is dimensioned to match the contour of a wearers heal to ensure there is no friction on the wearers skin. Figure 9 shows how the heel can be integrated with leaf spring mechanism 4 and incorporated into an insole 403 of a shoe, similar to Figure 8. A 'twin sole' can be provided namely an outer sole and an inner sole as shown. Figure 10 illustrates a side view of Figure 9 further showing the double heel in use. This embodiment, which can be viewed as a single leaf twin sole twin heel, enables the shoe to be adapted to existing shoe designs, especially distinctive high heel design, whilst providing further comfort and security for the wearer in use. In the specification the terms "comprise, comprises, comprised and comprising" or any variation thereof and the terms "include, includes, included and including" or any variation thereof are considered to be totally interchangeable and they should all be afforded the widest possible interpretation and vice versa.
