TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates in general to the field of spinal prosthesis, and more particularly, to an interbody axis cage and a method for sitting the same for providing improved spinal stability, alignment, and patient comfort following a spinal surgical procedure. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is described in connection with spinal joint prosthesis and methods and devices for enhancing spinal stability and alignment. A variety of artificial prosthesis are used to replace chronically injured or ruptured intervertebral discs and range from plate inserts, ball and socket joints, gel filled enclosures, spring-biased plates, plate and joint combinations and others. For example, U.S. Patent Publication No. 20080262550 discloses methods for stabilizing upper and lower spinal vertebrae having a disc situated between the upper and lower vertebrae are described. First and second fasteners are inserted into the upper vertebra. Third and fourth fasteners are inserted into the lower vertebra. At least two of the first, second, third, and fourth fasteners are connected with an elongate element. In an alternative embodiment, at least three of the first, second, third, and fourth fasteners are connected with the elongate element. The elongate element may be an elastic connector or a cable. The elongate element may also have first and second ends that are connected by a crimp. Another example is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,770,096 which relates to an interbody spinal stabilization method and an interbody spinal stabilization cage. The cage has a parallelepipedic shape and comprises a central hollow space intended to be filled with bone fragments. The cage also comprises anchoring device(s) having an overall S shape and opening onto lateral faces connecting with adjacent vertebrae, actuated by at least one actuation device opening into a front face. The anchoring device(s) each have at least one main cutting edge. Another example of a spinal cage is taught in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20090054991, which discloses a spinal cage system for inserting a spinal cage assembly into a spine to separate and support adjacent spinal vertebrae, that includes a first cage member; a second cage member; and an articulating mechanism adapted to connect the first cage member to the second cage member and to permit the first and second cage members to move relate to each other. An insertion instrument is adapted to capture the spinal cage assembly for insertion of the spinal cage assembly into a spine and to rotate the first and second cage members relative to each other to achieve a desired orientation in the spine. Finally, U.S. Pat. No. 7,824,445 discloses an improved artificial spinal implant system for replacing a disc or vertebral body that provides adjustability in height, and provides support and stability of the spine with proper lordosis or kyphosis, osseous-integration of the implant, and motion preservation (if desired) of the adjacent vertebrae while preserving the space. Motion preservation in the Biro invention is achieved with compressible and/or tiltable artificial discs.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention and do not delimit the scope of the invention. To facilitate the understanding of this invention, a number of terms are defined below. Terms defined herein have meanings as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the areas relevant to the present invention. Terms such as “a”, “an” and “the” are not intended to refer to only a singular entity, but include the general class of which a specific example may be used for illustration. The terminology herein is used to describe specific embodiments of the invention, but their usage does not delimit the invention, except as outlined in the claims. The present invention describes an interbody axis cage with alternating points of axes in the X and Y direction that allow for 3-dimensional motion. The axis cage of the present invention is roughly cylindrical in shape and it incorporates a threaded outerbody to facilitate screwing in. The axis cage of the present invention is cannulated and incorporates a flexible reamer/cutter to “tap” for cage placement. The spine encloses the spinal cord and includes thirty-three vertebrae. The vertebrae are divided into four regions that include the uppermost seven vertebrae referred to as the cervical vertebrae, followed sequentially by the twelve thoracic vertebrae, the five lumbar vertebrae and the five sacral vertebrae. The final four vertebrae are referred to as the coccygeal vertebrae. Although the vertebrae of each region have a different structure, the basic vertebra structure has certain similarities. The vertebral body is the anterior part of the vertebra and is roughly cylindrical. The vertebral body has a superior surface that is concave transversely and convex antero-posterioly with prominent elevations on each side. Two articular facets on the inferior surface of the body articulate with the uncinate processes. Additionally, the posterior arch is formed by the pedicles, the articular processes, the laminae and the spinous processes. The vertebral pedicles are short and thick regions projecting backwards and slightly laterally from the vertebral body. The articular processes are located at the junction of the pedicles and laminae and are made up of the superior articular process that articulates with the above vertebra and the inferior articular process that articulates with the vertebra below it. The laminae are long and thin, extending backwards and medially from the pedicle to meet the midline thereby completing the posterior arch. The spinous processes project backwards from the junction of the laminae. Transverse processes arise anteriorly from the vertebral body and posteriorly from the articular processes to form the vertebral foramen. The vertebral foramen is the triangular region occupied by the spinal cord, meninges and associated vessels. Additionally, the vertebrae cephalad to the sacral vertebrae are united by articular capsules and by ligaments and separated by fibrocartilaginous intervertebral discs. The outside surface of the vertebral body is made of a relatively strong cortical bone layer, while the center of the vertebral body is made of a weak cancellous bone. The vertebral bodies are separated by intervertebral discs, which provide the majority of the weight bearing support of the vertebral column. The intervertebral discs include a cartilage shell enclosing a central mass that provides cushioning and dampening of compressive forces applied to the vertebral bodies and the spinal column. Generally, the central mass is relatively inelastic, but can bulge outward to accommodate loads applied axially to the spinal. The successive positioning of the vertebral body allows the vertebral foramen to surround the spinal cord and retain articulation of the vertebrae and extend posteriorly of the spinal canal. The complicated vertebral structure, the degree of spinal articulation and complicated network of connective elements make the spine susceptible to many forms of damage, e.g., traumatic spinal injuries, tumors, infections, surgeries, disease processes, aging processes, and congenital abnormalities. Various types of spinal column disorders are known and include degenerative disc disease, excess lordosis (abnormal backward curvature of the spine), fractured vertebra, kyphosis (abnormal forward curvature of the spine), ruptured discs, scoliosis (abnormal lateral curvature of the spine), slipped discs, spondylolisthesis (abnormal forward displacement of vertebra) and the like. The figures depict specific embodiments of the present invention used for support and alignment of the spine. As will be disclosed in detail herein, the present invention will have wide applicability to a number of different locations and for replacement of many different types of joints. The axis cage depicted in the figures, are non-limiting examples of the present invention. In addition the present invention includes embodiments that are used in other locations in the body and various cages. The variable angle attachment mechanism of the present invention may be used in various medical devices known to the skilled artisan. FIG. 1 is a front view of an interbody axis cage 100 of the present invention. Cage 100 comprises a plurality of inter-connected discs 102, 104, 106, and 108. The discs are inter-connected by placing or insertion through an aperture (not shown) and once inserted through the aperture the inserted discs are held in place by screws/fasteners (110 and 112). FIG. 2A is an end view of the interbody axis cage showing a disc 200, with an aperture 204 (for insertion of a subsequent disc). The disc surface is shown in 202, and a screw/fastener holding the disc in place in the aperture 204 is shown in 206. FIG. 2B is an end view of the interbody axis cage showing a disc 200, with an aperture 204 (for insertion of a subsequent disc). The disc surface is shown in 202, and a screw/fastener holding the disc in place in the aperture 204 is shown in 206. The aperture 204 is depicted as an oval or a circle in this embodiment but may be any shape depending on the application. FIG. 2C is an end view of the interbody axis cage showing a disc 200, with an aperture 204 (for insertion of a subsequent disc). The disc surface is shown in 202, and a screw/fastener holding the disc in place in the aperture 204 is shown in 206A-206B. The screw/fastener 206A-206B may be position in the side of the device as to not penetrate the aperture 204 allowing the aperture 204 to be unobstructed. The screw/fastener 206A-206B may be inserted into the side and terminated prior to the aperture 204. In addition it is possible to have a combination of different types of screw/fasteners in a single device. For example, the device may include a screw/fastener 206A-206B be position in the side of the device to penetrate the aperture 204 allowing the aperture 204 to be partially obstructed. The next segment includes a screw/fastener 206A-206B be inserted into the side and terminated prior to the aperture 204 allowing the aperture 204 to be partially unobstructed. This can be repeated or varied as necessary for the insertion. FIG. 3 is a front view of an interbody axis cage 100 of the present invention. Cage 100 comprises a plurality of inter-connected discs 102, 104, 106, and 108. The discs are inter-connected by placing or insertion through an aperture (not shown) and once inserted through the aperture the inserted discs are held in place by screws/fasteners (110 and 112). The inter-connected discs 102-108 each have a window 114A-114D that is depicted here as rectangular but may be of any shape and/or any size or depth. The window 114A-114D may contain one or more active agents known to the skilled artisan, e.g., antibiotics, active agents, growth agents, and so forth. The windows 114A-114D is to allow for the placement and housing for one or more grafts materials. The windows 114A-114D may individually have graft materials, active agents or a combination thereof. FIGS. 4A and 4B are images of cannulated insertion device and a cannulated reamer, respectively. The cannulated insertion device depicted in FIG. 4A allows the insertion in difficult to access regions without additional incisions for access. The cannulated insertion device allows the passage of a wire or other material through the device and change the angle of exit from the cannulated insertion device. Therefore allowing access to more limited regions. FIG. 4B depicted a cannulated reamer. The cannulated insertion device and a cannulated reamer allow a less invasive method of insertion. The flexible reamer or a cutter may be used to aid in cage placement. The discs of the present invention may be fabricated from generally biocompatible materials including, without limitation, titanium, surgical alloys, stainless steel, chrome-molybdenum alloy, cobalt chromium alloy, zirconium oxide ceramic, non-absorbable polymers and other anticipated biocompatible metallic, ceramic or polymeric materials and combinations thereof. The discs may be fabricated from different materials and may even be fabricated by using different materials within each disc. Certain materials may even be used to coat a portion or all of a disc, e.g., a titanium disc may be fused, welded, melted, coated, impregnated or infused along it's a portion or all of its periphery with a ceramic or a polymer. Alternatively, the fused, welded, melted, coated, impregnated or infused material may be on a portion or all of one surface but not another, or may completely surround the disc. The components of the present invention may be constructed from any suitable similar or dissimilar materials (e.g., titanium, a titanium alloy, a metal, an alloy, a stainless steel, a composite, a polymer, a blend of polymers, a carbon fiber, a plastic, a thermoplastic, a ceramic, carbon nanotubes, a synthetic material or other material known to the skilled artisan) depending on the particular need or application. In addition, combinations and mixtures of material may be used, e.g., ceramic coated metal, carbon nanotube coated metal and/or ceramic, polymer coated metal and/or ceramic, a magnetic material combined with a polymer, an electrical conductive material combined with a polymer, metal, plastic, etc. and so-forth. For example, polymers and many lightweight and remarkably strong materials that include a reinforced two-phase material, carbon fiber reinforced plastic, carbon fiber, plastic, polymers or combinations thereof. Polymers such as silicone, polyethylene, nylon, vinyl, methylmethacyrate, dacrons or teflon may be used. The screws may be made of a strong material (e.g., metal, magnamite graphite fiber, carbon reinforced plastic) so as to prevent the screws from being sheared off by the stress of the system. Additionally, porous material in which the porosity is controlled by the replamine form process may be used. The materials used are not limited to the above noted and may also include other suitable solid materials that have the above-noted properties. The present invention provides a method of inserting the instant device that includes placing a curved guidewire guide about the disc space. A guidewire is then placed into position across the disk space. A reamer is then passed over the guidewire and material removed. This process is repeated with increasingly larger reamers to remove the disk material and perform endplate preparations. A treaded flexible implant (of the correct diameter) is then threaded into position.
