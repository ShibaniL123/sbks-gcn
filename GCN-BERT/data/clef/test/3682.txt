Step 7: 4-(4-(4-(3-(dimethylamino)prop-1-yn-1-yl)-3-fluorophenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-N-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanamide
To a solution of 4-(4-(4-(3-(dimethylamino)prop-1-yn-1-yl)-3-fluorophenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-N-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)butanamide (160 mg, 1 eq) in MeOH (6 ml) was added with HCl solution in MeOH (1.25N, 0.72 ml, 3 eq), and the mixture was stirred for 2 hr at room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was diluted with water (6 ml) and adjusted the pH to 7.0. The water was concentrated and the resulting residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (89 mg, 57%).
