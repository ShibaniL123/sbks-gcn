Synthesis of tert-butyl (3-((2-(methoxymethoxy)-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) phenyl)amino)-5-nitro-4-pyrimidinyl)amino)phenyl)carbamate
tert-butyl-3-(2-chloro-5-nitropyrimidin-4-amino)phenylcarbamate (902 mg, 2.47 mmol), 2-(methoxymethoxy)-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-aniline (775 mg, 2.47 mmol) and DIPEA (956 mg, 7.40 mmol) were weighed into a 100 ml of round bottom flask. 50 ml of tetrahydrofuran was added, heated to reflux and mixed overnight. After the reaction was completed, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL × 2). The organic phase was washed with saturated ammonium chloride solution (50 mL × 2) and saturated sodium chloride solution, and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation and the crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (dichloromethane / methanol = 30: 1, v / v) to give tert-butyl (3-((2-(methoxymethoxy)-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl)amino)-5-nitro-4-pyrimidinyl)amino)phenyl)carbamate as orange-red solid, 945 mg, yield 66%.
