[Step 6] Synthesis of 2-((3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl methanesulfonate
N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-N-(4-(2-(2,2-difluoroacetyl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-2-hydroxyacetamide (0.658 g, 1.470 mmol), synthesized in step 5, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.768 mL, 4.409 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL) at room temperature, and methanesulfonyl chloride (0.284 mL, 3.674 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 12 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 50%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.254 g, 34.0%) as yellow oil.
