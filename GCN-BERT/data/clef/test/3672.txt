FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel monomers, polymers and copolymers comprising such monomers, as well as compositions and methods using such polymers in various applications, in particular as polymeric dispersants in coatings applications. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Dispersants are widely used in coating industries to disperse inorganic or organic pigments. Dispersants can be divided to small molecules and polymers with varied chemistries. Compared to small molecule dispersants, polymeric dispersants show better dispersing efficiency and stability for many pigments especially inorganic pigments. Most widely used polymeric dispersants are based on acrylic acid homopolymer or copolymers. However, pigment slurries especially aqueous slurries containing such dispersants have very limited shelf life from a couple weeks to months. This is because these dispersants have drawbacks in providing sufficient stabilization, which often times cause the settling of pigment. Therefore, it is still challenging in the coating industry to develop an efficient dispersant to improve the stability of pigment.

The polymeric dispersant copolymer of the present invention can be conveniently prepared from the above-described monomers by known aqueous emulsion polymerization techniques using free-radical producing initiators, typically in an amount from 0.01 percent to 3 percent, based on the weight of the monomers. In one embodiment, the polymerization is conducted at a pH of about 5.0 or less. Polymerization at an acid pH of about 5.0 or less permits direct preparation of an aqueous colloidal dispersion having relatively high solids content without the problem of excessive viscosity. In one embodiment, the polymerization is conducted in the presence of one or more free-radical producing initiators selected from peroxygen compounds. Useful peroxygen compounds include inorganic persulfate compounds such as ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate, sodium persulfate, peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, for example, cumene hydroperoxide, and t-butyl hydroperoxide, organic peroxides, for example, benzoyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, peracetic acid, and perbenzoic acid (sometimes activated by a water-soluble reducing agent such as ferrous compound or sodium bisulfite), and other free-radical producing materials or techniques such as 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile and high energy radiation sources. In one embodiment, the polymerization is conducted in the presence of one or more emulsifiers. Useful emulsifiers include anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, and zwitterionic surfactants. In one embodiment, the emulsion polymerization is conducted in the presence of one or more anionic surfactants. Examples of anionic emulsifiers are the alkali metal alkyl aryl sulfonates, the alkali metal alkyl sulfates and the sulfonated alkyl esters. Specific examples of these well-known emulsifiers are sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, sodium dodecyl butylnaphthalene sulfonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, disodium dodecyl diphenyl ether disulfonate, disodium n-octadecyl sulfosuccinamate and sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate.

The emulsion polymerization may, optionally, be conducted in the presence, in an amount up to about 10 parts per 100 parts of polymerizable monomers, of one or more chain transfer agents. Representative chain transfer agents are carbon tetrachloride, bromoform, bromotrichloromethane, and long-chain alkyl mercaptans and thioesters, such as n-dodecyl mercaptan, t-dodecyl mercaptan, octyl mercaptan, tetradecyl mercaptan, hexadecyl mercaptan, butyl thioglycolate, isooctyl thioglycolate, and dodecyl thioglycolate.

In one embodiment, the polymerization is carried out at a temperature between about 60° C. and 90° C., but higher or lower temperatures may be used. The polymerization can be conducted batchwise, stepwise, or continuously with batch and/or continuous addition of the monomers, in a conventional manner. The monomers can be copolymerized in such proportions, and the resulting emulsion polymers can be physically blended, to give products with the desired balance of properties for specific applications. For example, for analogous polymers of a given molecular weight, increasing the amount of first monomer tends to increase the yield strength exhibited by the polymer, increasing the relative amount of second monomer tends to increase the viscosity of the polymer. One or more fourth monomers may be added to adjust the properties of the polymer. These polymeric products prepared by emulsion polymerization at an acid pH are in the form of stable aqueous colloidal dispersions containing the polymer dispersed as discrete particles having average particle diameters of about 400 to about 3000 Å (40 to 300 nanometers) and preferably about 600 to about 1750 Å (60 to 175 nanometers), as measured by light scattering. Dispersions containing polymer particles smaller than about 400 Å (40 nanometers) are difficult to stabilize, while particles larger than about 3000 Å (300 nanometers) reduce the ease of dispersion in the aqueous products to be thickened. In one embodiment, the polymer composition is in the form of an aqueous polymer dispersion, typically having a solids content including the polymer and any surfactants that may be present and based on the total weight of the polymer dispersion, of up to about 60 wt % and, more typically about 20 to about 50 wt %. Alternatively this (co)polymerization may also be conducted by different methods or in different solvents. The scope of methods and solvents is well known to those skilled in the art. Thus, these polymers for use in the present invention can be made using known solution polymerization techniques, wherein the reactant monomers and initiator are dissolved in an appropriate solvent such as toluene, xylene, tetrahydrofuran, or mixtures thereof. Polymerization can be accomplished in the time and at the temperature necessary, e.g., 60° C. to 80° C. and about 2 to 24 hours.

Such compositions include brine, slurries, and colloidal dispersions of water-insoluble inorganic and organic materials, such as natural rubber, synthetic or artificial latexes. Synthetic latexes take the form of aqueous dispersions/suspensions of particles of latex polymers.

V. Emulsion Polymerization to Make Latex Binder for Latex Paint Emulsion polymerization is discussed in G. Pohlein, “Emulsion Polymerization”, Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, vol. 6, pp. 1-51 (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY, NY, 1986), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Emulsion polymerization is a heterogeneous reaction process in which unsaturated monomers or monomer solutions are dispersed in a continuous phase with the aid of an emulsifier system and polymerized with free-radical or redox initiators. The product, a colloidal dispersion of the polymer or polymer solution, is called a latex. The monomers typically employed in emulsion polymerization to make latex for latex paint include such monomers as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, 2-ethyl hexyl acrylate, other acrylates, methacrylates and their blends, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, styrene, vinyl toluene, vinyl acetate, vinyl esters of higher carboxylic acids than acetic acid, e.g. vinyl versatate, acrylonitrile, acrylamide, butadiene, ethylene, vinyl chloride and the like, and mixtures thereof. This is further discussed below in the section entitled “Latex Monomers”. In the above process, suitable initiators, reducing agents, catalysts and surfactants are well known in the art of emulsion polymerization. Typical initiators include ammonium persulfate (APS), hydrogen peroxide, sodium, potassium or ammonium peroxydisulfate, dibenzoyl peroxide, lauryl peroxide, ditertiary butyl peroxide, 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile, t-butyl hydroperoxide, benzoyl peroxide, and the like. Commonly used redox initiation systems are described e.g., by A. S. Sarac in Progress in Polymer Science 24(1999), 1149-1204. Suitable reducing agents are those which increase the rate of polymerization and include for example, sodium bisulfite, sodium hydrosulfite, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, ascorbic acid, isoascorbic acid, and mixtures thereof. Suitable catalysts are those compounds which increase the rate of polymerization and which, in combination with the above-described reducing agents, promote decomposition of the polymerization initiator under the reaction conditions. Suitable catalysts include transition metal compounds such as, for example, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, ferrous chloride, cupric sulfate, cupric chloride, cobalt acetate, cobaltous sulfate, and mixtures thereof. Emulsion polymerization occurs in the presence of an emulsifier. Typically the mixture contains 0.5 to 6 wt % emulsifier based on weight of latex monomers Typical emulsifiers are ionic or non-ionic surfactants polymerizable or non-polymerizable in the aqueous coating composition including latex polymer. Suitable ionic and nonionic surfactants are alkyl polyglycol ethers such as ethoxylation products of lauryl, tridecyl, oleyl, and stearyl alcohols; alkyl phenol polyglycol ethers such as ethoxylation products of octyl- or nonylphenol, diisopropyl phenol, triisopropyl phenol; alkali metal or ammonium salts of alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl sulfonates, sulfates, phosphates, and the like, including sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium octylphenol glycolether sulfate, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, sodium lauryldiglycol sulfate, and ammonium tritertiarybutyl phenol and penta- and octa-glycol sulfonates, sulfosuccinate salts such as disodium ethoxylated nonylphenol half ester of sulfosuccinic acid, disodium n-octyldecyl sulfosuccinate, sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate, and the like. The polymer latex binder can be produced by first preparing an initiator solution comprising the initiator and water. A monomer pre-emulsion is also prepared comprising one or more surfactants (emulsifiers), and other latex monomers to be used to form the latex polymer, water, and additional additives such as NaOH. Thus, a typical process of emulsion polymerization preferably involves charging water to a reactor and feeding as separate streams a pre-emulsion of the monomer and a solution of the initiator. In particular, the polymer latex binder can be prepared using emulsion polymerization by feeding the monomers used to form the latex binder to a reactor in the presence of at least one initiator and at least one surfactant and polymerizing the monomers to produce the latex binder. Typically the initiator solution and monomer pre-emulsion are continuously added to the reactor over a predetermined period of time (e.g. 1.5-5 hours) to cause polymerization of latex monomers to produce the latex polymer. Prior to the addition of the initiator solution and the monomer pre-emulsion, a seed latex such as a polystyrene seed latex can be added to the reactor. For example, a small amount of the pre-emulsion and a portion of the initiator may be charged initially at the reaction temperature to produce “seed” latex. The “seed” latex procedure results in better particle-size reproducibility. Under “normal” initiation conditions, that is initiation conditions under which the initiator is activated by heat, the polymerization is normally carried out at about 60-90° C. A typical “normal” initiated process, for example, could employ ammonium persulfate as initiator at a reaction temperature of 80+/−2° C. Under “redox” initiation conditions, namely initiation conditions under which the initiator is activated by a reducing agent, the polymerization is normally carried out at 60-70° C. Normally, the reducing agent is added as a separate solution. A typical “redox” initiated process, for example, could employ potassium persulfate as the initiator and sodium metabisulfite as the reducing agent at a reaction temperature of 65+/−2° C. The reactor is operated at desired reaction temperature at least until all the monomers are fed to produce the polymer latex binder. Once the polymer latex binder is prepared, it is preferably chemically stripped thereby decreasing its residual monomer content. Preferably, it is chemically stripped by continuously adding an oxidant such as a peroxide (e.g. t-butylhydroperoxide) and a reducing agent (e.g. sodium acetone bisulfite), or another redox pair such as those described by A. S. Sarac in Progress in Polymer Science 24(1999), 1149-1204, to the latex binder at an elevated temperature and for a predetermined period of time (e.g. 0.5 hours). The pH of the latex binder can then be adjusted and other additives added after the chemical stripping step. In the above emulsions, the polymer preferably exists as a generally spherical particle, dispersed in water, with a diameter of about 50 nanometers to about 500 nanometers. For purposes of this description, monomers from which latex polymers may be derived are termed “latex monomers”. The latex monomers fed to a reactor to prepare the polymer latex binder preferably include at least one acrylic monomer selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid, acrylic acid esters, methacrylic acid, and methacrylic acid esters. In addition, the monomers can include styrene, vinyl acetate, or ethylene. The monomers can also include one or more monomers selected from the group consisting of styrene, (alpha)-methyl styrene, vinyl chloride, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, ureido methacrylate, vinyl acetate, vinyl esters of branched tertiary monocarboxylic acids (e.g. vinyl esters commercially available under the mark VEOVA from Shell Chemical Company or sold as EXXAR neo vinyl esters by ExxonMobil Chemical Company), itaconic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, and ethylene. It is also possible to include C4-C8 conjugated dienes such as 1,3-butadiene, isoprene or chloroprene. Commonly used monomers in making acrylic paints are butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate and the like. Preferably, the monomers include one or more monomers selected from the group consisting of n-butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, styrene and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate. The latex polymer is typically selected from the group consisting of pure acrylics (comprising acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, an acrylate ester, and/or a methacrylate ester as the main monomers); styrene acrylics (comprising styrene and acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, an acrylate ester, and/or a methacrylate ester as the main monomers); vinyl acrylics (comprising vinyl acetate and acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, an acrylate ester, and/or a methacrylate ester as the main monomers); and acrylated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers (comprising ethylene, vinyl acetate and acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, an acrylate ester, and/or a methacrylate ester as the main monomers). The monomers can also include other main monomers such as acrylamide and acrylonitrile, and one or more functional monomers such as itaconic acid and ureido methacrylate, as would be readily understood by those skilled in the art. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the latex polymer is a pure acrylic such as a butyl acrylate/methyl methacrylate copolymer derived from monomers including butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate. In typical acrylic paint compositions the polymer is comprised of one or more esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid, typically a mixture, e.g. about 50/50 by weight, of a high Tg monomer (e.g. methyl methacrylate) and a low Tg monomer (e.g. butyl acrylate), with small proportions, e.g. about 0.5% to about 2% by weight, of acrylic or methacrylic acid. The vinyl-acrylic paints usually include vinyl acetate and butyl acrylate and/or 2-ethyl hexyl acrylate and/or vinyl versatate. In vinyl-acrylic paint compositions, at least 50% of the polymer formed is comprised of vinyl acetate, with the remainder being selected from the esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid. The styrene/acrylic polymers are typically similar to the acrylic polymers, with styrene substituted for all or a portion of the methacrylate monomer thereof.

Thus, the term includes water per se as well as aqueous solutions and dispersions. VI. Other Additives As described above, latex paints and coatings may contain various adjuvants. The aqueous coating compositions of the invention include less than 2% by weight and preferably less than 1.0% by weight of anti-freeze agents based on the total weight of the aqueous coating composition. For example, the aqueous coating compositions may be substantially free of anti-freeze agents. The aqueous coating composition typically includes at least one pigment.

Accordingly, the aqueous coating composition of the invention preferably has a VOC level of less than about 100 g/L and more preferably less than or equal to about 50 g/L. The balance of the aqueous coating composition of the invention is water.

EXPERIMENTS New pigment polymeric dispersant with higher efficiency and improved stability of the pigment concentration: Efficiency and optimum usage level of dispersant was determined by dispersant demand curve studies. The starting point formulation for demand curve varies depending on pigment. Typically, organic pigments can be evaluated at 40-50% pigment loading, while carbon blacks can vary from 10-50% pigment loading depending on their properties such as particle size and surface treatment. The process was prepared as follows: as a starting point, prepare a formulation consisting of pigment, dispersant, defoamer, Deionized (DI) water, and base (if needed). Liquid ingredients were added, including a small amount of polymeric dispersant as described herein, to the grind pot and mixed at low speeds using a high shear (Cowles) disperser. After a homogeneous mixture has been obtained, pigment was slowly added. Once all of the pigment had been added, mixed at a maximum speed needed to create a strong vortex. After premix finished, attached cooling water, added milling beads and prepared for milling. After 30 minutes milling, waited one minute and measured the viscosity via Brookfield viscometer. Continued to add dispersant incrementally and milled for 4-6 minutes after each addition, and take the measurement for viscosity. Test completed when the viscosity shows significant increase.
