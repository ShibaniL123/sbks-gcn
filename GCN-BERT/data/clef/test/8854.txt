[0013] The terms "coupled" is defined as connected, although not necessarily directly, and not necessarily mechanically; two items that are "coupled" may be unitary with each other. The terms "a" and "an" are defined as one or more unless this disclosure explicitly requires otherwise. The term "substantially" is defined as largely but not necessarily wholly what is specified (and includes what is specified; e.g., substantially 90 degrees includes 90 degrees and substantially parallel includes parallel), as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art. In any disclosed embodiment, the terms "substantially," "approximately," and "about" may be substituted with "within [a percentage] of what is specified, where the percentage includes .1, 1, 5, and 10 percent. [0014] The terms "comprise" (and any form of comprise, such as "comprises" and "comprising"), "have" (and any form of have, such as "has" and "having"), "include" (and any form of include, such as "includes" and "including") and "contain" (and any form of contain, such as "contains" and "containing") are open-ended linking verbs. As a result, a system or unit that "comprises," "has," "includes" or "contains" one or more elements possesses those one or more elements, but is not limited to possessing only those elements. Likewise, a method that "comprises," "has," "includes" or "contains" one or more steps possesses those one or more steps, but is not limited to possessing only those one or more steps. [0015] The term "detect" (and any form of detect, such as "detects," "detected," and "detecting") is used broadly throughout this disclosure to include receiving information, obtaining or gathering of information, and any calculations for and/or manipulations of such information that may result in additional information. The term should include terms such as measuring, identifying, receiving, obtaining, gathering, similar terms, and derivatives of such terms. [0016] Further, a structure (e.g., a component of a system or unit) that is configured in a certain way is configured in at least that way, but it can also be configured in other ways than those specifically described. [0017] Any embodiment of any of the present systems, units, and methods can consist of or consist essentially of - rather than comprise/include/contain/have - any of the described steps, elements, and/or features. Thus, in any of the claims, the term "consisting of or "consisting essentially of can be substituted for any of the open-ended linking verbs recited above, in order to change the scope of a given claim from what it would otherwise be using the open-ended linking verb. [0018] Details associated with the embodiments described above and others are presented below.

DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS [0067] Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly FIGS. 1-16, shown therein and designated by reference number 100 is one embodiment of the present filtration systems. Filtration systems of this disclosure can be used, for example, to filter tap water for drinking. In the embodiments shown, filtration system 100 comprises filtration unit 102. Filtration unit 102 includes housing 104, which is configured to be coupled to a pitcher (and is coupled to pitcher 108, for example, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1). The present systems, filtration units, and pitchers can be made with standard materials (e.g., plastics, metals, and the like) using standard manufacturing techniques (e.g., injection molding) and/or with materials that can be purchased commercially (e.g., O-rings, nipples, screws, and the like). Housing 104 can comprise any suitable shape configured to at least partially accommodate a pitcher (e.g., pitcher 108), such as an H-like configuration having two recessed portions (e.g., as shown in FIG. 8), one of which is configured to accommodate pitcher 108 and the other of which is configured to accommodate a filter and a carbonation canister (discussed in detail below). Housing 104 can also include drain 112, which can assist in preventing fluid from spilling onto areas surrounding filtration system 100. [0068] As shown in FIGS. 1-3, 5-6, 8-9, and 15-16, filtration unit 102 (and, more specifically, housing 104) is coupled to pitcher 108. Pitcher 108 comprises lid 112, base 116, and valve 120, which is disposed in base 116. Valve 120 and dry break assembly 124 of filtration unit 102 are configured to cooperate to permit fluid communication between an interior of pitcher 108 and filtration unit 102. For example, as shown in FIGS. 1-3, 5-6, 8-9, and 15-16, valve 120 of pitcher 108 is biased in a closed configuration such that if pitcher 108 is uncoupled from filtration unit 102, valve 120 remains in a closed configuration to prevent fluid in pitcher 108, if any, from exiting pitcher 108. If pitcher 108 is coupled to filtration unit 102, dry break assembly 124 and valve 120 cooperate to permit valve 120 to move into an open configuration, further permitting fluid in pitcher 108, if any, to exit pitcher 108 and enter filtration unit 102. Dry break assembly 124 is configured to substantially prevent fluid from exiting filtration system 100, such as by providing a fluid-tight seal (e.g., using O-rings). As will be discussed in detail below, fluid can move via tubing 128 into other components of filtration unit 102. [0069] As shown in FIGS. 1-3, 5, and 9-10, pitcher 108 is coupled to cooling stick 132, which is depicted alone in FIGS. 11A-11B. In the embodiment shown, cooling stick 132 is substantially cylindrical; however, in other embodiments, cooling stick 132 can comprise any suitable shape that can be accommodated by a pitcher to which it is coupled (e.g., pitcher 108), such as substantially rectangular, substantially trapezoidal, and the like. Pitcher 108 comprises an opening in lid 112 that is sized to accommodate cooling stick 132 (e.g., the opening in lid 112 is substantially circular and comprises a larger diameter than the diameter of cooling stick 132, in the embodiment shown). Cooling stick 132 can be introduced into pitcher 108 through the opening in lid 112. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 11B, cooling stick 132 is coupled (e.g., threadably) to cooling stick lid 136. Cooling stick lid 136 is configured to interact with and/or couple to lid 112 of pitcher 108 to, for example, prevent fluid in pitcher 108, if any, from exiting pitcher 108 through the opening in lid 112 and to prevent cooling stick 132 from moving toward base 116 of pitcher 108 after cooling stick lid 136 interacts with and/or couples to lid 112 of pitcher 108. Cooling stick 132 comprises a chillable or freezable fluid or solid, such as water, refrigerants, gels, and the like, such that if cooling stick 132 is chilled or frozen and disposed in pitcher 108 having a fluid, heat from the fluid in pitcher 108 can transfer into cooling stick 132 (and, more specifically, into the fluid or solid within cooling stick 132) to chill the fluid in pitcher 108. [0070] The present filtration systems, including filtration system 100 (and more specifically housing 104 of filtration unit 102), are configured to be coupled to a filter, such as filter 140, for example, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 8. Filters in this disclosure can be similar in construction and/or material to the filters found in the Model AQ-4000, AQ-4025, or AQ-4035 filter assemblies (e.g., Cartridge A and/or Cartridge B of either Model) available from Aquasana, Inc., Austin, Texas, USA. As such, the filters may comprise carbon, and, more specifically, may be characterizable as activated carbon filtration filters, such as those configured to remove impurities from water. Such filters can include one or more of the following features: an operating pressure range of 20-80 pounds per square inch, a rated capacity of 500 gallons, a maximum operating temperature of 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and a maximum flow rate of 0.4 gallons per minute. The filters of this disclosure can be coupled to and/or operate with the present filtration systems in any suitable way, including in the ways described in detail in pending patent application number 14/160,498, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Other ways in which a filter can be coupled to and/or operate with the present filtrations systems are described in detail below. [0071] Further, the present filtration systems, including filtration system 100 (and more specifically housing 104 of filtration unit 102), are configured to be coupled to a carbonation canister, such as carbonation canister 144, for example, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 8. Carbonation canisters, which can comprise fluid, such as C02, and in-line carbonation systems and apparatuses are described in detail by U.S. Patent Application No. 12/772,641 (Publication No. US 2011/0268845) and International Patent Application No. PCT/US2011/033709 (Publication No. WO/2011/139614), which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. Other ways in which carbonation and in-line carbonation systems can operate with the present filtrations systems are described in detail below. [0072] In the embodiment shown, filtration system 100 further comprises pump 148, as shown in FIG. 9, which is coupled to housing 104 of filtration unit 102. Pump 148 can be coupled to any suitable component of housing 104 of filtration unit 102, and in any suitable way, including by adhesives, screws, bolts, and the like. Tubing 128, which is coupled to dry break assembly 124, is also coupled to pump 128 to permit fluid to be pumped into other components of filtration system 100. Further, tubing 152 is also coupled to pump 148 and to filter 140 such that pump 148 and filter 140 (as well as dry break assembly 124) are in fluid communication. [0073] As shown in FIG. 16, filter 140 is coupled to solenoid 156 (e.g., via tubing 158) and solenoid 160 (e.g., via tubing 162). Carbonation canister 144 is coupled to solenoid 164 (e.g., via tubing 166). Solenoid 156 is further coupled to spout 170 (e.g., via tubing 174). Solenoid 160 is coupled to carbonator 178 (e.g., via tubing 182), and solenoid 164 is coupled to carbonator 178 (e.g., via tubing 186). Additionally, carbonator 178 is coupled to flow conditioner 188 (e.g., via tubing 190). Tubing 190 can comprise a conditioning insert that is configured to mix fluid from carbonator 178, which is discussed in detail below. Flow conditioner 188 is coupled to spout 170 (e.g., via tubing 192). [0074] In the embodiment shown, a user can activate a first configuration or a second configuration, for example, by pressing first button 193 to activate a first configuration or by pressing second button 194 to activate a second configuration. In the embodiment shown, controller 195 is coupled (e.g., electrically) to pump 148, solenoid 156, and first button 193. If a user activates a first configuration by pressing first button 193 and if pitcher 108 comprises fluid and is coupled to filtration unit 102 (as depicted in FIG. 1), filtration system 100 (and, more specifically filtration unit 102) can filter fluid from pitcher 108 and dispense fluid from filtration unit 102 (e.g., through spout 170 of housing 104). More specifically, if a user activates a first configuration by pressing first button 193, controller 195 signals pump 148 to begin pumping fluid from pitcher 108, and controller 195 signals solenoid 156 to open. As pitcher 108 is coupled to filtration unit 102, valve 120 of pitcher 108 and dry break assembly 124 cooperate to permit fluid from the interior of pitcher 108 to enter filtration unit 102. Pump 148 pumps fluid through tubing 128, through tubing 152, and into filter 140, where fluid from pitcher 108 can be filtered. Filtered fluid exits filter 140 through tubing 158, passing through solenoid 156 (which was opened by controller 195), through tubing 174, and out of housing 104 of filtration unit 102 through spout 170. [0075] If a user activates a second configuration by pressing second button 194 and if pitcher 108 comprises fluid and is coupled to filtration unit 102 (as depicted in FIG. 1), filtration system 100 (and, more specifically filtration unit 102) can filter fluid from pitcher 108, mix fluid from pitcher 108 with fluid from carbonation canister 144, and dispense fluid from filtration unit 102 (e.g., through spout 170 of housing 104). More specifically, if a user activates a second configuration by pressing second button 194, controller 195 signals pump 148 to begin pumping fluid from pitcher 108, and controller 195 signals solenoid 160 and solenoid 164 to open. As pitcher 108 is coupled to filtration unit 102, valve 120 of pitcher 108 and dry break assembly 124 cooperate to permit fluid from the interior of pitcher 108 to enter filtration unit 102. Pump 148 pumps fluid through tubing 128, through tubing 152, and into filter 140, where fluid from pitcher 108 can be filtered. Filtered fluid from pitcher 108 exits filter 140 through tubing 162, passing through solenoid 160 (which was opened by controller 195), through tubing 182 and into carbonator 178 to be mixed with fluid from carbonation canister 144. Fluid from carbonation canister passes through tubing 166, through solenoid 164 (which was opened by controller 195), through tubing 186, and into carbonator 178 to be mixed with filtered fluid from pitcher 108. After an initial mixing of filtered fluid from pitcher 108 and fluid from carbonation canister 144 in carbonator 178, mixed fluid passes through tubing 190, which, as stated above, can comprise a conditioning insert that encourages further mixing of filtered fluid from pitcher 108 and fluid from carbonation canister 144. Mixed fluid then passes into flow conditioner 188, which is configured, for example, to control fluid flow, fluid pressure, and fluid mixing. For example, before fluid exits filtration unit 102, filtration unit 102 (and, more specifically, flow conditioner 188) is configured such that fluid flow pressure is approximately 60 pounds per square inch (e.g., flow conditioner 188 is configured to maintain fluid pressure at approximately 60 pounds per square inch). In other embodiments, however, fluid flow can comprise more (e.g., 65, 70, 75 or more pounds per square inch) or less (e.g., 55, 50, 45, or less pounds per square inch) pressure before exiting filtration unit 102. Mixed fluid can then pass through tubing 192 and out of housing 104 of filtration unit 102 through spout 170. [0076] In some embodiments, filtration system 100 can further comprise a sensor coupled (e.g., electrically) to controller 195 and configured to detect if fluid enters filtration unit 102 such that if a user activates a first configuration or a second configuration, controller 195 is configured to pump fluid from pitcher 108 after the sensor detects that fluid has entered filtration unit 102 (e.g., so that pump 148 does not activate if no fluid has entered filtration unit 102). [0077] In some embodiments, filtration system 102 is configured to alert a user when filter 140 should be replaced. For example, filtration unit 102 can be configured to detect an amount of flow through filter 140 and/or through some component of filtration unit 102 to alert a user when filter 140 should be replaced. In some embodiments, filtration unit 102 can be configured to alert a user that a filter should be replaced based on a volume of flow through filter 140 and/or through some component of filtration unit 102. In some embodiments, filtration unit 102 can be configured to alert a user that a filter should be replaced based on an approximate time of usage. For example, a replacement indicator can be coupled to filtration unit 102, and the replacement indicator can be configured to alert a user when filter 140 should be replaced and/or when filter 140 has a given amount of usage remaining, such as, for example, by activating an LED or by changing a color of an LED. After the filter has been replaced, filtration unit 102 can be configured to automatically reset any volumetric and/or temporal tracking of the filter, and/or filtration unit 102 can be configured to permit a user to reset (e.g., by pressing a button) any volumetric and/or temporal tracking of the filter.

Door 297 opens to permit a user to couple a carbonation canister to or decouple a carbonation canister from housing 204. Further, door 297 is configured to close to, for example, prevent visibility of carbonation canister 244 or to prevent a user from accessing carbonation canister 244.
