Example 23
To a suspension of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2(1H)-one (0.100 g, 0.406 mmol) and 2,4-dimethylhiazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.073 g, 0.467 mmol), and pyridine (0.15 mL, 1.832 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.85 mL, 1421 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 50° C. for 5 days. After cooling, the mixture was quenched with water (10 mL) and extracted with 8:2 dichloromethane/isopropanol (2×25 mL) followed by washing once with sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The crude mixture was purified by precipitation in minium amount of dichloromethane. The obtained solid was collected by filtration and washed with cold dichloromethane to give 2,4-dimethyl-N-(4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)thiazole-5-carboxamide (0.129 g, 82%) as a brown solid.
