LATIN NAME OF THE GENUS AND SPECIES Zantedeschia sprengeri VARIETY DENOMINATION ‘CAPTAIN SOLO’ BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The new cultivar is a product of a planned breeding program. The new variety originated from a cross pollination, made by the inventor in 2008, of a proprietary seed parent identified as ‘04453(scp.8534-9b)’ and a proprietary pollen parent identified as ‘06330(apm.1198)’, both Zantedeschia sprengeri. The new variety was discovered and selected by the inventor, Anthonius Simon Johannes Kapiteijn, a citizen of the Netherlands, in June of 2010 in a group of seedlings resulting from the crossing. The new cultivar was found in a commercial greenhouse belonging to the inventor in Anna Paulowna, the Netherlands. Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar ‘CAPTAIN SOLO’ was first performed by tissue culture at a commercial laboratory in the Netherlands in 2011. Tissue cultured plants were subsequently grown out to produce tubers. ‘CAPTAIN SOLO’ has been reproduced by both tissue culture and tubers and has shown that the unique features of this cultivar are stable and reproduced true to type. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The cultivar ‘CAPTAIN SOLO’ has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, day length, and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘CAPTAIN SOLO’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘CAPTAIN SOLO’ as a new and distinct Zantedeschia cultivar: 1. Yellow inflorescence. 2. Flowers occurring above leaves. 3. Short plant height. PARENT COMPARISON Plants of the new cultivar ‘CAPTAIN SOLO’ are similar to plants of the seed parent variety, in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar produce yellow inflorescence, whereas the seed parent produces an orange inflorescence. Plants of the new cultivar ‘CAPTAIN SOLO’ are similar to plants of the pollen parent variety, in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar produce yellow inflorescence, whereas the pollen parent produces an orange inflorescence. Plants of the new cultivar ‘CAPTAIN SOLO’ are similar to plants of the unpatented variety, Zantedeschia sprengeri ‘Golden Nugget’, unpatented in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar are shorter in height, produce more flowers and a rounder inflorescence shape than ‘Golden Nugget’ Plants of the new cultivar ‘CAPTAIN SOLO’ are also similar to plants of the unpatented variety, Zantedeschia sprengeri ‘Serrada’, unpatented in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar are shorter in height, produce a darker yellow flower color and a rounder inflorescence shape than ‘Serrada’. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH The accompanying photograph in FIG. 1 illustrates in full color typical plants of ‘CAPTAIN SOLO’ grown in a greenhouse in Anna Paulowna, the Netherlands. The plants are approximately 2 year old, shown growing in 14 cm pots. The photograph was taken using conventional techniques and although colors may appear different from actual colors due to light reflectance it is as accurate as possible by conventional photographic techniques. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION In the following description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart 2007 except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used. The following observations and measurements describe ‘CAPTAIN SOLO’ plants grown in a climate controlled greenhouse in Anna Paulowna, the Netherlands. Temperatures ranged from 18° C. to 22° C. day to 12° C. to 16° C. at night. No artificial light or photoperiodic treatments were given to the plants. The following chemical treatments were used; GA 3 (Berelex) growth regulator. Before planting growth retardant (padobutrazol) at a dose of 1 ppm.
