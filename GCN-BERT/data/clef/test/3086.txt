3-(2-Ethoxyethyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)-5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carbaldehyde
1.1 g (7.97 mmol) of potassium carbonate were added to a solution of 900 mg (3.19 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 371A in 29 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 15 min. Then 1.79 g (9.56 mmol) of 1-fluoro-3-iodopropane were added, and the mixture was stirred at 50Â° C. for 18 h. The DMF was then very substantially distilled off and the remaining residue was partitioned between semisaturated sodium chloride solution (100 ml) and ethyl acetate (50 ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. 977 mg (87% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
