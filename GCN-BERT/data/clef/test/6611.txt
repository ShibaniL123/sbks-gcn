The sequence listing is incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND [004] Mammals are colonized by microbes in the gastrointestinal (Gl) tract, on the skin, and in other epithelial and tissue niches such as the oral cavity, eye surface and vagina. The gastrointestinal tract harbors an abundant and diverse microbial community. It is a complex system, providing an environment or niche for a community of many different species or organisms, including diverse strains of bacteria. Flundreds of different species may form a commensal community in the Gl tract in a healthy person, and this complement of organisms evolves from the time of birth to ultimately form a functionally mature microbial population by about 3 years of age. Interactions between microbial strains in these populations and between microbes and the host, e.g. the host immune system, shape the community structure, with availability of and competition for resources affecting the distribution of microbes. Such resources may be food, location and the availability of space to grow or a physical structure to which the microbe may attach. For example, host diet is involved in shaping the Gl tract flora. [005] A healthy microbiota provides the host with multiple benefits, including colonization resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogens, essential nutrient biosynthesis and absorption, and immune stimulation that maintains a healthy gut epithelium and an appropriately controlled systemic immunity. In settings of ‘dysbiosis’ or disrupted symbiosis, microbiota functions can be lost or deranged, resulting in increased susceptibility to pathogens, altered metabolic profiles, or induction of proinflammatory signals that can result in local or systemic inflammation or autoimmunity. Thus, the intestinal microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of many diseases and disorders, including a variety of pathogenic infections of the gut. For instance, subjects become more susceptible to pathogenic infections when the normal intestinal microbiota has been disturbed due to use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Many of these diseases and disorders are chronic conditions that significantly decrease a subject’s quality of life and can be ultimately fatal. [006] Manufacturers of probiotics have asserted that their preparations of bacteria promote mammalian health by preserving the natural microflora in the Gl tract and reinforcing the normal controls on aberrant immune responses. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 8,034,601. Probiotics, however, have been limited to a very narrow group of genera and a correspondingly limited number of species; as such, they do not adequately replace the missing natural microflora of the Gl tract in many situations. [007] Thus practitioners have a need for a method of populating a subject’s gastrointestinal tract with a diverse and useful selection of microbiota in order to alter a dysbiosis. [008] Therefore, in response to the need for durable, efficient, and effective compositions and methods for treatment of Gl diseases by way of restoring or enhancing microbiota functions, we address these and other shortcomings of the prior art by providing compositions and methods for treating subjects. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [009] Disclosed herein are therapeutic compositions containing ηοηpathogenic, germination-competent bacterial spores, for the prevention, control, and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, disorders and conditions and for general nutritional health. These compositions are advantageous in being suitable for safe administration to humans and other mammalian subjects and are efficacious in numerous gastrointestinal diseases, disorders and conditions and in general nutritional health. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [010] Figure 1Α provides a schematic of 16S rRNAgene and denotes the coordinates of hypervariable regions 1-9 (V1-V9). Coordinates of V1-V9 are 69-99, 137-242, 433-497, 576-682, 822-879, 986-1043, 1117-1173, 1243-1294, and 1435-1465 respectively, based on numbering using Ε. coli system of nomenclature defined by Brosius et al., Complete nucleotide sequence of a 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA)from Escherichia coli, PNAS 75(10):4801-4805 (1978). Figure 1Β highlights in bold the nucleotide sequences for each hypervariable region in the exemplary reference Ε. coli 16S sequence described by Brosius et al. [011] Figure 2 shows a photograph of a CsCI gradient demonstrating the spore separation from other residual habitat material. [012] Figure 3 shows three phase contrast image demonstrating the progressive enrichment of spores from a fecal suspension; ethanol treated, CsCI purified spore preparation; and an ethanol treated, CsCI purified, sucrose purified spore preparation. [013] Figure 4 shows a set of survival curves demonstrating efficacy of the spore population in a mouse prophylaxis model of C. difficile. [014] Figure 5 provides a set of survival curves demonstrating efficacy of the spore population in a hamster relapse prevention model of C. difficile. [015] Figure 6 demonstrates the cell viability under a variety of ethanol and heat treatments for varying lengths of time. [016] Figure 7 demonstrates cell survivability from four donor fecal samples after heat treatment at 60C for 5 minutes. [017] Figure 8 demonstrates that ethanol reduces both anaerobic and aerobic bacterial species by several orders of magnitude in seconds. [018] Figure 9 demonstrates the spore concentration of fecal donations from multiple donors over time. [019] Figure 10 shows the strong correlation and linear correspondence between the measurement of DPA concentration by a coupled fluorescence assay and the viable spore colony forming units [020] Figure 11 demonstrates the effect on various germination treatments on the ability to cultivate vegetative bacteria from a spore population. [021] Figure 12 demonstrates the increase in bacterial diversity from using a germinant treatment to grow vegetative bacteria from spore populations. [022] Figure 13 demonstrates the role of heat activation at various temperatures on spores from three different donor fecal samples. [023] Figure 14 demonstrates a lysozyme treatment with heat activation improves germination at most temperatures. [024] Figure 15 demonstrates spore concentrations present in a fecal sample grown on various medias. [025] Figure 16 demonstrates similar spore production from incubating plates for 2 and 7 days after a spore population was germinated on plates with various medias. [026] Figure 17 demonstrates the protective efficacy of the spore population in mice challenged with C. difficile as measured by the change in weight of mice over the course of the experiment. Each plot tracks the change in the individual mouse’s weight relative to day -1 over the course of the experiment. The number of deaths over the course of the experiment is indicated at the top of the chart and demonstrated by a line termination prior to day 6. The top panels (from left to right) are the vehicle control arm, the fecal suspension arm, and the untreated naive control arm, while the bottom panels are the ethanol treated, gradient purified spore preparation; the ethanol treated, gradient purified, “germinable” spore preparation, and ethanol treated, gradient purified, “sporulatable” preparation. [027] Figure 18 demonstrates the microbial diversity measured in the ethanol treated spore treatment sample and patient pre- and post-treatment samples. Total microbial diversity is defined using the Chaol Alpha-Diversity Index and is measured at the same genomic sampling depths to confirm adequate sequence coverage to assay the microbiome in the target samples. The patient pretreatment (purple) harbored a microbiome that was significantly reduced in total diversity as compared to the ethanol treated spore treatment (red) and patient post treatment at days 5 (blue), 14 (orange), and 25 (green). [028] Figure 19 demonstrates how the patient microbial ecology is shifted by treatment with an ethanol treated spore treatment from a dysbiotic state to a state of health. Principle coordinates analysis based on the total diversity and structure of the microbiome (Bray Curtis Beta Diversity) of the patient pre- and post-treatment delineates that the combination of engraftment of the OTUs from the spore treatment and the augmentation of the patient microbial ecology leads to a microbial ecology that is distinct from both the pretreatment microbiome and the ecology of the ethanol treated spore treatment. [029] Figure 20 demonstrates the augmentation of bacteroides species in patients treated with the spore population. Comparing the number of Bacteroides colonies from fecal suspensions pre-treatment and in week 4 post treatment reveals an increase of 4 logs or greater. Colonies were enumerated by serial dilution and plating on Bacteroides Bile Esculin agar which is highly selective for the Β. fragilis group. Species were determined by 16S full-length sequence identification. [030] Figure 21 demonstrates the increase in number of species engrafting and species augmenting in patient’s microbiomes after treatment with an ethanol-treated spore population. Relative abundance of species that engrafted or augmented as described were determined based on the number of 16S sequence reads. Each plot is from a different patient treated with the ethanol-treated spore population for recurrent C. difficile. [031 ] The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein. DESCRIPTION OF THE TABLES [032] Table 1. List of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) with taxonomic assignments made to Genus, Species, and Phylogenetic Clade. Clade membership of bacterial OTUs is based on 16S sequence data. Clades are defined based on the topology of a phylogenetic tree that is constructed from full-length 16S sequences using maximum likelihood methods familiar to individuals with ordinary skill in the art of phylogenetics. Clades are constructed to ensure that all OTUs in a given clade are: (i) within a specified number of bootstrap supported nodes from one another, and (ii) within 5% genetic similarity. OTUs that are within the same clade can be distinguished as genetically and phylogenetically distinct from OTUs in a different clade based on 16S-V4 sequence data, while OTUs falling within the same clade are closely related. OTUs falling within the same clade are evolutionarily closely related and may or may not be distinguishable from one another using 16S-V4 sequence data. Members of the same clade, due to their evolutionary relatedness, play similar functional roles in a microbial ecology such as that found in the human gut. Compositions substituting one species with another from the same clade are likely to have conserved ecological function and therefore are useful in the present invention. All OTUs are denoted as to their putative capacity to form spores and whether they are a Pathogen or Pathobiont (see Definitions for description of “Pathobiont”). NIAID Priority Pathogens are denoted as ‘Category-A’, ‘Category-B’, or ‘Category-C’, and Opportunistic Pathogens are denoted as OP’. OTUs that are not pathogenic or for which their ability to exist as a pathogen is unknown are denoted as ‘N’. The ‘SEQ ID Number’ denotes the identifier of the OTU in the Sequence Listing File and ‘Public DB Accession’ denotes the identifier of the OTU in a public sequence repository.

These compositions are advantageous in being suitable for safe administration to humans and other mammalian subjects and are efficacious in numerous gastrointestinal diseases, disorders and conditions and in general nutritional health. While spore-based compositions are known, these are generally prepared according to various techniques such as lyophilization or spray-drying of liquid bacterial cultures, resulting in poor efficacy, instability, substantial variability and lack of adequate safety and efficacy. [060] It has now been found that populations of bacterial spores can be obtained from biological materials obtained from mammalian subjects, including humans. These populations are formulated into compositions as provided herein, and administered to mammalian subjects using the methods as provided herein. DEFINITIONS [061 ] “Microbiota” refers to the community of microorganisms that occur (sustainably or transiently) in and on an animal subject, typically a mammal such as a human, including eukaryotes, archaea, bacteria, and viruses (including bacterial viruses i.e., phage). [062] “Microbiome” refers to the genetic content of the communities of microbes that live in and on the human body, both sustainably and transiently, including eukaryotes, archaea, bacteria, and viruses (including bacterial viruses (i.e., phage)), wherein “genetic content” includes genomic DNA, RNA such as ribosomal RNA, the epigenome, plasmids, and all other types of genetic information. [063] “Microbial Carriage” or simply “Carriage” refers to the population of microbes inhabiting a niche within or on humans. Carriage is often defined in terms of relative abundance. For example, OTU1 comprises 60% of the total microbial carriage, meaning that OTU1 has a relative abundance of 60% compared to the other OTUs in the sample from which the measurement was made. Carriage is most often based on genomic sequencing data where the relative abundance or carriage of a single OTU or group of OTUs is defined by the number of sequencing reads that are assigned to that OTU/s relative to the total number of sequencing reads for the sample. [064] “Microbial Augmentation” or simply “augmentation” refers to the establishment or significant increase of a population of microbes that are (i) absent or undetectable (as determined by the use of standard genomic and microbiological techniques) from the administered therapeutic microbial composition, (ii) absent, undetectable, or present at low frequencies in the host niche (as example: gastrointestinal tract, skin, anterior-nares, or vagina) before the delivery of the microbial composition, and (iii) are found after the administration of the microbial composition or significantly increase, for instance 2-fold, 5-fold, 1x102, 1x103, 1x104, 1 χ105, 1 χ106, 1 χ107, or greater than 1 χ108, in cases where they were present at low frequencies. The microbes that comprise an augmented ecology can be derived from exogenous sources such as food and the environment, or grow out from microniches within the host where they reside at low frequency. [065] The administration of the therapeutic microbial composition induces an environmental shift in the target niche that promotes favorable conditions for the growth of these commensal microbes. In the absence of treatment with a therapeutic microbial composition, the host can be constantly exposed to these microbes; however, sustained growth and the positive health effects associated with the stable population of increased levels of the microbes comprising the augmented ecology are not observed. [066] “Microbial Engraftment” or simply “engraftment” refers to the establishment of OTUs comprising a therapeutic microbial composition in a target niche that are absent in the treated host prior to treatment. The microbes that comprise the engrafted ecology are found in the therapeutic microbial composition and establish as constituents of the host microbial ecology upon treatment. Engrafted OTUs can establish for a transient period of time, or demonstrate long-term stability in the microbial ecology that populates the host post treatment with a therapeutic microbial composition. The engrafted ecology can induce an environmental shift in the target niche that promotes favorable conditions for the growth of commensal microbes capable of catalyzing a shift from a dysbiotic ecology to one representative of a health state. [067] “Ecological Niche” or simply “Niche” refers to the ecological space in which a an organism or group of organisms occupies. Niche describes how an organism or population or organisms responds to the distribution of resources, physical parameters (e.g., host tissue space) and competitors (e.g., by growing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (e.g., limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey). [068] “Dysbiosis” refers to a state of the microbiota of the gut or other body area in a subject, including mucosal or skin surfaces in which the normal diversity and/or function of the ecological network is disrupted. This unhealthy state can be due to a decrease in diversity, the overgrowth of one or more pathogens or pathobionts, symbiotic organisms able to cause disease only when certain genetic and/or environmental conditions are present in a subject, or the shift to an ecological microbial network that no longer provides an essential function to the host subject, and therefore no longer promotes health. [069] “Pathobionts” or “Opportunistic Pathogens” refers to symbiotic organisms able to cause disease only when certain genetic and/or environmental conditions are present in a subject. [070] “Phylogenetic tree” refers to a graphical representation of the evolutionary relationships of one genetic sequence to another that is generated using a defined set of phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms (e.g. parsimony, maximum likelihood, or Bayesian). Nodes in the tree represent distinct ancestral sequences and the confidence of any node is provided by a bootstrap or Bayesian posterior probability, which measures branch uncertainty. [071] Operational taxonomic units,” “OTU” (or plural, “OTUs”) refer to a terminal leaf in a phylogenetic tree and is defined by a nucleic acid sequence, e.g., the entire genome, or a specific genetic sequence, and all sequences that share sequence identity to this nucleic acid sequence at the level of species. In some embodiments the specific genetic sequence may be the 16S sequence or a portion of the 16S sequence. In other embodiments, the entire genomes of two entities are sequenced and compared. In another embodiment, select regions such as multilocus sequence tags (MLST), specific genes, or sets of genes may be genetically compared. In 16S embodiments, OTUs that share >97% average nucleotide identity across the entire 16S or some variable region of the 16S are considered the same OTU (see e.g. Claesson MJ, Wang Q, O’Sullivan O, Greene-Diniz R, Cole JR, Ros RP, and O’Toole PW. 2010. Comparison of two nextgeneration sequencing technologies for resolving highly complex microbiota composition using tandem variable 16S rRNA gene regions. Nucleic Acids Res38: ℮200. Konstantin id is ΚΤ, Ramette A, and Tiedje JM. 2006. The bacterial species definition in the genomic era. Philos Trans R Soc Lond Β Biol Sci361: 1929-1940.). In embodiments involving the complete genome, MLSTs, specific genes, or sets of genes OTUs that share >95% average nucleotide identity are considered the same OTU (see e.g. Achtman Μ, and Wagner Μ. 2008. Microbial diversity and the genetic nature of microbial species. Nat. Rev. Microbiol.6: 431-440. Konstantinidis ΚΤ, Ramette A, and Tiedje JM. 2006. The bacterial species definition in the genomic era. Philos Trans R Soc Lond Β Biol Sci361: 1929-1940.). OTUs are frequently defined by comparing sequences between organisms. Generally, sequences with less than 95% sequence identity are not considered to form part of the same OTU. OTUs may also be characterized by any combination of nucleotide markers or genes, in particular highly conserved genes (e.g., “house-keeping” genes), or a combination thereof. Such characterization employs, e.g., WGS data or a whole genome sequence. [072] “Residual habitat products” refers to material derived from the habitat for microbiota within or on a human or animal. For example, microbiota live in feces in the gastrointestinal tract, on the skin itself, in saliva, mucus of the respiratory tract, or secretions of the genitourinary tract (i.e., biological matter associated with the microbial community). Substantially free of residual habitat products means that the bacterial composition no longer contains the biological matter associated with the microbial environment on or in the human or animal subject and is 100% free, 99% free, 98% free, 97% free, 96% free, or 95% free of any contaminating biological matter associated with the microbial community. Residual habitat products can include abiotic materials (including undigested food) or it can include unwanted microorganisms. Substantially free of residual habitat products may also mean that the bacterial composition contains no detectable cells from a human or animal and that only microbial cells are detectable. In one embodiment, substantially free of residual habitat products may also mean that the bacterial composition contains no detectable viral (including bacterial viruses (i.e., phage)), fungal, mycoplasmal contaminants. In another embodiment, it means that fewer than 1x10"2%, 1x10'3%, 1x10'4%, 1x10'5%, 1x10'6%, 1x10'7%, 1x1 O'8 of the viable cells in the bacterial composition are human or animal, as compared to microbial cells. There are multiple ways to accomplish this degree of purity, none of which are limiting. Thus, contamination may be reduced by isolating desired constituents through multiple steps of streaking to single colonies on solid media until replicate (such as, but not limited to, two) streaks from serial single colonies have shown only a single colony morphology. Alternatively, reduction of contamination can be accomplished by multiple rounds of serial dilutions to single desired cells (e.g., a dilution of 10'8 or 10" 9), such as through multiple 10-fold serial dilutions. This can further be confirmed by showing that multiple isolated colonies have similar cell shapes and Gram staining behavior. Other methods for confirming adequate purity include genetic analysis (e.g. PCR, DNA sequencing), serology and antigen analysis, enzymatic and metabolic analysis, and methods using instrumentation such as flow cytometry with reagents that distinguish desired constituents from contaminants. [073] “Clade” refers to the OTUs or members of a phylogenetic tree that are downstream of a statistically valid node in a phylogenetic tree. The clade comprises a set of terminal leaves in the phylogenetic tree that is a distinct monophyletic evolutionary unit and that share some extent of sequence similarity. [074] In microbiology, “16S sequencing” or “16S-rRNA” or “16S” refers to sequence derived by characterizing the nucleotides that comprise the 16S ribosomal RNA gene(s). The bacterial 16S rDNA is approximately 1500 nucleotides in length and is used in reconstructing the evolutionary relationships and sequence similarity of one bacterial isolate to another using phylogenetic approaches. 16S sequences are used for phylogenetic reconstruction as they are in general highly conserved, but contain specific hypervariable regions that harbor sufficient nucleotide diversity to differentiate genera and species of most bacteria. [075] The “V1-V9 regions” of the 16S rRNA refers to the first through ninth hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene that are used for genetic typing of bacterial samples. These regions in bacteria are defined by nucleotides 69-99, 137-242, 433-497, 576-682, 822-879, 986-1043, 1117-1173, 1243-1294 and 1435-1465 respectively using numbering based on the Ε. coli system of nomenclature. Brosius et al., Complete nucleotide sequence of a 16S ribosomal RNA gene from Escherichia coli, PNAS 75(10):4801-4805 (1978). In some embodiments, at least one of the V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, and V9 regions are used to characterize an OTU. In one embodiment, the V1, V2, and V3 regions are used to characterize an OTU. In another embodiment, the V3, V4, and V5 regions are used to characterize an OTU. In another embodiment, the V4 region is used to characterize an OTU. A person of ordinary skill in the art can identify the specific hypervariable regions of a candidate 16S rRNA by comparing the candidate sequence in question to a reference sequence and identifying the hypervariable regions based on similarity to the reference hypervariable regions, or alternatively, one can employ Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequence characterization of microbes or a microbial community. [076] The term “subject” refers to any animal subject including humans, laboratory animals (e.g., primates, rats, mice), livestock (e.g., cows, sheep, goats, pigs, turkeys, and chickens), and household pets (e.g., dogs, cats, and rodents). The subject may be suffering from a dysbiosis, including, but not limited to, an infection due to a gastrointestinal pathogen or may be at risk of developing or transmitting to others an infection due to a gastrointestinal pathogen. [077] The term “phenotype” refers to a set of observable characteristics of an individual entity. As example an individual subject may have a phenotype of “health” or “disease”. Phenotypes describe the state of an entity and all entities within a phenotype share the same set of characteristics that describe the phenotype. The phenotype of an individual results in part, or in whole, from the interaction of the entities genome and/or microbiome with the environment. [078] The term “Network Ecology” refers to a consortium of OTUs that co-occur in some number of subjects. As used herein, a “network” is defined mathematically by a graph delineating how specific nodes (i.e. OTUs) and edges (connections between specific OTUs) relate to one another to define the structural ecology of a consortium of OTUs. Any given Network Ecology will possess inherent phylogenetic diversity and functional properties. A Network Ecology can also be defined in terms of function where for example the nodes would be comprised of elements such as, but not limited to, enzymes, clusters of orthologous groups (COGS; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21090/), or KEGG pathways (www.genome.jp/kegg/). [079] The terms “Network Class”, “Core Network” and “Core Network Ecology” refer to a group of network ecologies that in general are computationally determined to comprise ecologies with similar phylogenetic and/or functional characteristics. A Core Network therefore contains important biological features, defined either phylogenetically or functionally, of a group (i.e., a cluster) of related network ecologies. One representation of a Core Network Ecology is a designed consortium of microbes, typically non-pathogenic bacteria, that represents core features of a set of phylogenetically or functionally related network ecologies seen in many different subjects. In many occurrences, a Core Network, while designed as described herein, exists as a Network Ecology observed in one or more subjects. Core Network ecologies are useful for reversing or reducing a dysbiosis in subjects where the underlying, related Network Ecology has been disrupted. [080] The term “Keystone OTU” refers to one or more OTUs that are common to many network ecologies and are members of networks ecologies that occur in many subjects (i.e. are pervasive) (Figure 1). Due to the ubiquitous nature of Keystone OTUs, they are central to the function of network ecologies in healthy subjects and are often missing or at reduced levels in subjects with disease. Keystone OTUs may exist in low, moderate, or high abundance in subjects. [081] The term “non-Keystone OTU” refers to an OTU that is observed in a Network Ecology and is not a keystone OTU. [082] The term “Phylogenetic Diversity” refers to the biodiversity present in a given Network Ecology or Core Network Ecology based on the OTUs that comprise the network. Phylogenetic diversity is a relative term, meaning that a Network Ecology or Core Network that is comparatively more phylogenetically diverse than another network contains a greater number of unique species, genera, and taxonomic families. Uniqueness of a species, genera, or taxonomic family is generally defined using a phylogenetic tree that represents the genetic diversity all species, genera, or taxonomic families relative to one another. In another embodiment phylogenetic diversity may be measured using the total branch length or average branch length of a phylogenetic tree. [083] “Spore” or “endospore” refers to an entity, particularly a bacterial entity, which is in a dormant, non-vegetative and non-reproductive stage. Spores are generally resistant to environmental stress such as radiation, desiccation, enzymatic treatment, temperature variation, nutrient deprivation, and chemical disinfectants. [084] A “spore population” refers to a plurality of spores present in a composition. Synonymous terms used herein include spore composition, spore preparation, ethanol treated spore fraction and spore ecology. A spore population may be purified from a fecal donation, e.g. via ethanol or heat treatment, or a density gradient separation or any combination of methods described herein to increase the purity, potency and/or concentration of spores in a sample. Alternatively, a spore population may be derived through culture methods starting from isolated spore former species or spore former OTUs or from a mixture of such species, either in vegetative or spore form. [085] In one embodiment, the spore preparation comprises spore forming species wherein residual non-spore forming species have been inactivated by chemical or physical treatments including ethanol, detergent, heat, sonication, and the like; or wherein the non-spore forming species have been removed from the spore preparation by various separations steps including density gradients, centrifugation, filtration and/or chromatography; or wherein inactivation and separation methods are combined to make the spore preparation. In yet another embodiment, the spore preparation comprises spore forming species that are enriched over viable non-spore formers or vegetative forms of spore formers. In this embodiment, spores are enriched by 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold, 1000-fold, 10,000-fold or greater than 10,000-fold compared to all vegetative forms of bacteria. In yet another embodiment, the spores in the spore preparation undergo partial germination during processing and formulation such that the final composition comprises spores and vegetative bacteria derived from spore forming species. [086] A “germinant” is a material or composition or physical-chemical process capable of inducing vegetative growth of a bacterium that is in a dormant spore form, or group of bacteria in the spore form, either directly or indirectly in a host organism and/or in vitro. [087] A “sporulation induction agent” is a material or physical-chemical process that is capable of inducing sporulation in a bacterium, either directly or indirectly, in a host organism and/or in vitro. [088] To “increase production of bacterial spores” includes an activity or a sporulation induction agent. “Production” includes conversion of vegetative bacterial cells into spores and augmentation of the rate of such conversion, as well as decreasing the germination of bacteria in spore form, decreasing the rate of spore decay in vivo, or ex vivo, or to increasing the total output of spores {e.g. via an increase in volumetric output of fecal material). [089] The “colonization” of a host organism includes the non-transitory residence of a bacterium or other microscopic organism. As used herein, “reducing colonization” of a host subject’s gastrointestinal tract (or any other microbiotal niche) by a pathogenic bacterium includes a reduction in the residence time of the pathogen in the gastrointestinal tract as well as a reduction in the number (or concentration) of the pathogen in the gastrointestinal tract or adhered to the luminal surface of the gastrointestinal tract. Measuring reductions of adherent pathogens may be demonstrated, e.g., by a biopsy sample, or reductions may be measured indirectly, e.g., by measuring the pathogenic burden in the stool of a mammalian host. [090] A “combination” of two or more bacteria includes the physical coexistence of the two bacteria, either in the same material or product or in physically connected products, as well as the temporal co-administration or co-localization of the two bacteria. [091] A “cytotoxic” activity or bacterium includes the ability to kill a bacterial cell, such as a pathogenic bacterial cell. A “cytostatic” activity or bacterium includes the ability to inhibit, partially or fully, growth, metabolism, and/or proliferation of a bacterial cell, such as a pathogenic bacterial cell. [092] To be free of “non-comestible products” means that a bacterial composition or other material provided herein does not have a substantial amount of a non-comestible product, e.g., a product or material that is inedible, harmful or otherwise undesired in a product suitable for administration, e.g., oral administration, to a human subject. Non-comestible products are often found in preparations of bacteria from the prior art. [093] As used herein the term "vitamin" is understood to include any of various fat-soluble or water-soluble organic substances (non-limiting examples include vitamin A, Vitamin Β1 (thiamine), Vitamin Β2 (riboflavin), Vitamin Β3 (niacin or niacinamide), Vitamin Β5 (pantothenic acid), Vitamin Β6 (pyridoxine, pyridoxal, or pyridoxamine, or pyridoxine hydrochloride), Vitamin Β7 (biotin), Vitamin Β9 (folic acid), and Vitamin Β12 (various cobalamins; commonly cyanocobalamin in vitamin supplements), vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin Ε, vitamin Κ, Κ1 and Κ2 (i.e. ΜΚ-4, ΜΚ-7), folic acid and biotin) essential in minute amounts for normal growth and activity of the body and obtained naturally from plant and animal foods or synthetically made, pro-vitamins, derivatives, analogs. [094] As used herein, the term "minerals" is understood to include boron, calcium, chromium, copper, iodine, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, silicon, tin, vanadium, zinc, or combinations thereof. [095] As used herein, the term "antioxidant" is understood to include any one or more of various substances such as beta-carotene (a vitamin A precursor), vitamin C, vitamin Ε, and selenium) that inhibit oxidation or reactions promoted by Reactive Oxygen Species ("ROS") and other radical and non-radical species. Additionally, antioxidants are molecules capable of slowing or preventing the oxidation of other molecules. Non-limiting examples of antioxidants include astaxanthin, carotenoids, coenzyme Q10 ("CoQ10"), flavonoids, glutathione, Goji (wolfberry), hesperidin, lactowolfberry, lignan, lutein, lycopene, polyphenols, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin Ε, zeaxanthin, or combinations thereof. COMPOSITIONS OF THE INVENTION [096] Disclosed herein are therapeutic compositions containing ηοηpathogenic, germination-competent bacterial spores, for the prevention, control, and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, disorders and conditions and for general nutritional health. These compositions are advantageous in being suitable for safe administration to humans and other mammalian subjects and are efficacious in numerous gastrointestinal diseases, disorders and conditions and in general nutritional health. While spore-based compositions are known, these are generally prepared according to various techniques such as lyophilization or spray-drying of liquid bacterial cultures, resulting in poor efficacy, instability, substantial variability and lack of adequate safety and efficacy. [097] It has now been found that populations of bacterial spores can be obtained from biological materials obtained from mammalian subjects, including humans. These populations are formulated into compositions as provided herein, and administered to mammalian subjects using the methods as provided herein. [098] Provided herein are therapeutic compositions containing a purified population of bacterial spores. As used herein, the terms “purify”, “purified” and “purifying” refer to the state of a population (e.g., a plurality of known or unknown amount and/or concentration) of desired bacterial spores, that have undergone one or more processes of purification, e.g., a selection or an enrichment of the desired bacterial spore, or alternatively a removal or reduction of residual habitat products as described herein. In some embodiments, a purified population has no detectable undesired activity or, alternatively, the level or amount of the undesired activity is at or below an acceptable level or amount. In other embodiments, a purified population has an amount and/or concentration of desired bacterial spores at or above an acceptable amount and/or concentration. In other embodiments, the ratio of desired-to-undesired activity (e.g. spores compared to vegetative bacteria), has changed by 2-, 5-, 10-, 30-, 100-, 300-, 1x104, 1x105, 1x106, 1x107, 1x108, or greater than 1χ108. In other embodiments, the purified population of bacterial spores is enriched as compared to the starting material (e.g., a fecal material) from which the population is obtained. This enrichment may be by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, 99.9999%, 99.9999%, or greater than 99.999999% as compared to the starting material. [099] In certain embodiments, the purified populations of bacterial spores have reduced or undetectable levels of one or more pathogenic activities, such as toxicity, an ability to cause infection of the mammalian recipient subject, an undesired immunomodulatory activity, an autoimmune response, a metabolic response, or an inflammatory response or a neurological response. Such a reduction in a pathogenic activity may be by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, 99.9999%, or greater than 99.9999% as compared to the starting material. In other embodiments, the purified populations of bacterial spores have reduced sensory components as compared to fecal material, such as reduced odor, taste, appearance, and umami. [0100] Provided are purified populations of bacterial spores that are substantially free of residual habitat products. In certain embodiments, this means that the bacterial spore composition no longer contains a substantial amount of the biological matter associated with the microbial community while living on or in the human or animal subject, and the purified population of spores may be 100% free, 99% free, 98% free, 97% free, 96% free, or 95% free of any contamination of the biological matter associated with the microbial community. Substantially free of residual habitat products may also mean that the bacterial spore composition contains no detectable cells from a human or animal, and that only microbial cells are detectable, in particular, only desired microbial cells are detectable. In another embodiment, it means that fewer than 1x10'2%, 1x10'3%, 1x10'4%, 1x10'5%, 1x10'6%, 1x10'7%, 1x10"8% of the cells in the bacterial composition are human or animal, as compared to microbial cells. In another embodiment, the residual habitat product present in the purified population is reduced at least a certain level from the fecal material obtained from the mammalian donor subject, e.g., reduced by at least about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, 99.9999%, or greater than 99.9999%. [0101] In one embodiment, substantially free of residual habitat products or substantially free of a detectable level of a pathogenic material means that the bacterial composition contains no detectable viral (including bacterial viruses (i.e., phage)), fungal, or mycoplasmal or toxoplasmal contaminants, or a eukaryotic parasite such as a helminth. Alternatively, the purified spore populations are substantially free of an acellular material, e.g., DNA, viral coat material, or non-viable bacterial material. Alternatively, the purified spore population may processed by a method that kills, inactivates, or removes one or more specific undesirable viruses, such as an enteric virus, including norovirus, poliovirus or hepatitis A virus. [0102] As described herein, purified spore populations can be demonstrated by genetic analysis (e.g., PCR, DNA sequencing), serology and antigen analysis, microscopic analysis, microbial analysis including germination and culturing, and methods using instrumentation such as flow cytometry with reagents that distinguish desired bacterial spores from non-desired, contaminating materials. [0103] Exemplary biological materials include fecal materials such as feces or materials isolated from the various segments of the small and large intestines. Fecal materials are obtained from a mammalian donor subject, or can be obtained from more than one donor subject, e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 750, 1000 or from greater than 1000 donors, where such materials are then pooled prior to purification of the desired bacterial spores. In another embodiment, fecal materials can be obtained from a single donor subject over multiple times and pooled from multiple samples e.g. 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 32, 35, 40, 45, 48, 50, 100 samples from a single donor. [0104] In alternative embodiments, the desired bacterial spores are purified from a single fecal material sample obtained from a single donor, and after such purification are combined with purified spore populations from other purifications, either from the same donor at a different time, or from one or more different donors, or both. [0105] Mammalian donor subjects are generally of good health and have microbiota consistent with such good health. Often, the donor subjects have not been administered antibiotic compounds within a certain period prior to the collection of the fecal material. In certain embodiments, the donor subjects are not obese or overweight, and may have body mass index (BMI) scores of below 25, such as between 18.5 and 24.9. In other embodiments, the donor subjects are not mentally ill or have no history or familial history of mental illness, such as anxiety disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, panic disorders, attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorders, eating disorders or mood disorders. In other embodiments, the donor subjects do not have irritable bowel disease (e.g., crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, colorectal cancer or a family history of these diseases. In other embodiments, donors have been screened for blood borne pathogens and fecal transmissible pathogens using standard techniques known to one in the art (e.g. nucleic acid testing, serological testing, antigen testing, culturing techniques, enzymatic assays, assays of cell free fecal filtrates looking for toxins on susceptible cell culture substrates). [0106] In some embodiments, donors are also selected for the presence of certain genera and/or species that provide increased efficacy of therapeutic compositions containing these genera or species. In other embodiments, donors are preferred that produce relatively higher concentrations of spores in fecal material than other donors. In further embodiments, donors are preferred that provide fecal material from which spores having increased efficacy are purified; this increased efficacy is measured using in vitro or in animal studies as described below. In some embodiments, the donor may be subjected to one or more pre-donation treatments in order to reduce undesired material in the fecal material, and/or increase desired spore populations. [0107] It is advantageous to screen the health of the donor subject prior to and optionally, one or more times after, the collection of the fecal material. Such screening identifies donors carrying pathogenic materials such as viruses (HIV, hepatitis, polio) and pathogenic bacteria. Post-collection, donors are screened about one week, two weeks, three weeks, one month, two months, three months, six months, one year or more than one year, and the frequency of such screening may be daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, semi-yearly or yearly. Donors that are screened and do not test positive, either before or after donation or both, are considered “validated” donors. [0108] Solvent treatments. To purify the bacterial spores, the fecal material is subjected to one or more solvent treatments. A solvent treatment is a miscible solvent treatment (either partially miscible or fully miscible) or an immiscible solvent treatment. Miscibility is the ability of two liquids to mix with each to form a homogeneous solution. Water and ethanol, for example, are fully miscible such that a mixture containing water and ethanol in any ratio will show only one phase. Miscibility is provided as a wt/wt%, or weight of one solvent in 100 g of final solution. If two solvents are fully miscible in all proportions, their miscibility is 100%. Provided as fully miscible solutions with water are alcohols, e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, propanediol, butanediol, etc. The alcohols can be provided already combined with water; e.g., a solution containing 10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 89%, 85%, 90%, 95% or greater than 95%. Other solvents are only partially miscible, meaning that only some portion will dissolve in water. Diethyl ether, for example, is partially miscible with water. Up to 7 grams of diethyl ether will dissolve in 93 g of water to give a 7% (wt/wt%) solution. If more diethyl ether is added, a two-phase solution will result with a distinct diethyl ether layer above the water. Other partially miscible materials include ethers, propanoate, butanoate, chloroform, dimethoxyethane, or tetrahydrofuran. In contrast, an oil such as an alkane and water are immiscible and form two phases. Further, immiscible treatments are optionally combined with a detergent, either an ionic detergent or a non-ionic detergent. Exemplary detergents include Triton Χ-100, Tween 20, Tween 80, Nonidet Ρ40, a pluronic, or a polyol. The solvent treatment steps reduces the viability of non-spore forming bacterial species by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, or 99.9999%, and it may optionally reduce the viability of contaminating protists, parasites and/or viruses. [0109] Chromatography treatments. To purify spore populations, the fecal materials are subjected to one or more chromatographic treatments, either sequentially or in parallel. In a chromatographic treatment, a solution containing the fecal material is contacted with a solid medium containing a hydrophobic interaction chromatographic (HIC) medium or an affinity chromatographic medium. In an alternative embodiment, a solid medium capable of absorbing a residual habitat product present in the fecal material is contacted with a solid medium that adsorbs a residual habitat product. In certain embodiments, the HIC medium contains sepharose or a derivatized sepharose such as butyl sepharose, octyl sepharose, phenyl sepharose, or butyl-s sepharose. In other embodiments, the affinity chromatographic medium contains material derivatized with mucin type I, II, III, IV, V, or VI, or oligosaccharides derived from or similar to those of mucins type I, II, III, IV, V, or VI. Alternatively, the affinity chromatographic medium contains material derivatized with antibodies that recognize spore-forming bacteria. [0110] Mechanical treatments. Provided herein is the physical disruption of the fecal material, particularly by one or more mechanical treatment such as blending, mixing, shaking, vortexing, impact pulverization, and sonication. As provided herein, the mechanical disrupting treatment substantially disrupts a non-spore material present in the fecal material and does not substantially disrupt a spore present in the fecal material, or it may disrupt the spore material less than the non-spore material, e.g. 2-fold less, 5-, 10-, 30-, 100-, 300-, 1000- or greater than 1000-fold less. Furthermore, mechanical treatment homogenizes the material for subsequent sampling, testing, and processing . Mechanical treatments optionally include filtration treatments, where the desired spore populations are retained on a filter while the undesirable (non-spore) fecal components to pass through, and the spore fraction is then recovered from the filter medium. Alternatively, undesirable particulates and eukaryotic cells may be retained on a filter while bacterial cells including spores pass through. In some embodiments the spore fraction retained on the filter medium is subjected to a diafiltration step, wherein the retained spores are contacted with a wash liquid, typically a sterile saline-containing solution or other diluent such as a water compatible polymer including a low-molecular polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution, in order to further reduce or remove the undesirable fecal components. [0111] Thermal treatments. Provided herein is the thermal disruption of the fecal material. Generally, the fecal material is mixed in a saline-containing solution such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subjected to a heated environment, such as a warm room, incubator, water-bath, or the like, such that efficient heat transfer occurs between the heated environment and the fecal material. Preferably the fecal material solution is mixed during the incubation to enhance thermal conductivity and disrupt particulate aggregates. Thermal treatments can be modulated by the temperature of the environment and/or the duration of the thermal treatment. For example, the fecal material or a liquid comprising the fecal material is subjected to a heated environment, e.g., a hot water bath of at least about 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100 or greater than 100 degrees Celsius, for at least about 1,5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 seconds, or 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, or 50 minutes, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more than 10 hours. In certain embodiments the thermal treatment occurs at two different temperatures, such as 30 seconds in a 100 degree Celsius environment followed by 10 minutes in a 50 degree Celsius environment. In preferred embodiments the temperature and duration of the thermal treatment are sufficient to kill or remove pathogenic materials while not substantially damaging or reducing the germination-competency of the spores. In other preferred embodiments, the temperature and duration of the thermal treatment is short enough to reduce the germination of the spore population. [0112] Irradiation treatments. Provided are methods of treating the fecal material or separated contents of the fecal material with ionizing radiation, typically gamma irradiation, ultraviolet irradiation or electron beam irradiation provided at an energy level sufficient to kill pathogenic materials while not substantially damaging the desired spore populations. For example, ultraviolet radiation at 254ηη∩ provided at an energy level below about 22,000 microwatt seconds per cm2 will not generally destroy desired spores. [0113] Centrifugation and density separation treatments. Provided are methods of separating desired spore populations from the other components of the fecal material by centrifugation. A solution containing the fecal material is subjected to one or more centrifugation treatments, e.g., at about 200 χ g, 1000 χ g, 2000 χ g, Differential centrifugation separates desired spores from undesired non-spore material; at low forces the spores are retained in solution, while at higher forces the spores are pelleted while smaller impurities (e.g., virus particles, phage, microscopic fibers, biological macromolecules such as free protein, nucleic acids and lipids) are retained in solution. For example, a first low force centrifugation pellets fibrous materials; a second, higher force centrifugation pellets undesired eukaryotic cells, and a third, still higher force centrifugation pellets the desired spores while smaller contaminants remain in suspension. In some embodiments density or mobility gradients or cushions (e.g., step cushions), such as CsCI, Percoll, Ficoll, Nycodenz, Flistodenz or sucrose gradients, are used to separate desired spore populations from other materials in the fecal material. [0114] Also provided herein are methods of producing spore populations that combine two or more of the treatments described herein in order to synergistically purify the desired spores while killing or removing undesired materials and/or activities from the spore population. It is generally desirable to retain the spore populations under non-germinating and non-growth promoting conditions and media, in order to minimize the growth of pathogenic bacteria present in the spore populations and to minimize the germination of spores into vegetative bacterial cells. [0115] Purified spore populations. As described herein, purified spore populations contain combinations of commensal bacteria of the human gut microbiota with the capacity to meaningfully provide functions of a healthy microbiota when administered to a mammalian subject. Without being limited to a specific mechanism, it is thought that such compositions inhibit the growth of a pathogen such as C. difficile, Salmonella spp., enteropathogenic Ε. coli, Fusobacterium spp., Klebsiella spp. and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., so that a healthy, diverse and protective microbiota can be maintained or, in the case of pathogenic bacterial infections such as C. difficile infection, repopulate the intestinal lumen to reestablish ecological control over potential pathogens. In one embodiment, the purified spore populations can engraft in the host and remain present for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 14 days, 21 days, 25 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, or longer than 90 days. Additionally, the purified spore populations can induce other healthy commensal bacteria found in a healthy gut to engraft in the host that are not present in the purified spore populations or present at lesser levels and therefore these species are considered to “augment” the delivered spore populations. In this manner, commensal species augmentation of the purified spore population in the recipient’s gut leads to a more diverse population of gut microbiota then present initially. [0116] Preferred bacterial genera include Acetanaerobacterium, Acetivibrio, Alicyclobacillus, Alkaliphilus, Anaerofustis, Anaerosporobacter, Anaerostipes, Anaerotruncus, Anoxybacillus, Bacillus, Bacteroides, Blautia, Brachyspira, Brevibacillus, Bryantella, Bulleidia, Butyricicoccus, Butyrivibrio, Catenibacterium, Chlamydiales, Clostridiaceae, Clostridiales, Clostridium, Collinsella, Coprobacillus, Coprococcus, Coxiella, Deferribacteres, Desulfitobacterium, Desulfotomaculum, Dorea, Eggerthella, Erysipelothrix, Erysipelotrichaceae, Ethanoligenens, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium, Filifactor, Flavonifractor, Flexistipes, Fulvimonas, Fusobacterium, Gemmiger, Geobacillus, Gloeobacter, Floldemania, Flydrogenoanaerobacterium, Kocuria, Lachnobacterium, Lachnospira, Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillus, Lactonifactor, Leptospira, Lutispora, Lysinibacillus, Mollicutes, Moorella, Nocardia, Oscillibacter, Oscillospira, Paenibacillus, Papillibacter, Pseudoflavonifractor, Robinsoniella, Roseburia, Ruminococcaceae, Ruminococcus, Saccharomonospora, Sarcina, Solobacterium, Sporobacter, Sporolactobacillus, Streptomyces, Subdoligranulum, Sutterella, Syntrophococcus, Thermoanaerobacter,Thermobifida, Turicibacter [0117] Preferred bacterial species are provided at Table 1 and demarcated as spore formers. Where specific strains of a species are provided, one of skill in the art will recognize that other strains of the species can be substituted for the named strain. [0118] In some embodiments, spore-forming bacteria are identified by the presence of nucleic acid sequences that modulate sporulation. In particular, signature sporulation genes are highly conserved across members of distantly related genera including Clostridium and Bacillus. Traditional approaches of forward genetics have identified many, if not all, genes that are essential for sporulation (spo). The developmental program of sporulation is governed in part by the successive action of four compartment-specific sigma factors (appearing in the order aF, σΕ, oG and σΚ), whose activities are confined to the forespore (oF and aG) or the mother cell (σΕ and σΚ). In other embodiments, spore-forming bacteria are identified by the biochemical activity of DPA producing enzymes or by analyzing DPA content of cultures. As part of the bacterial sporulation, large amounts of DPA are produced, and comprise 5-15% of the mass of a spore. Because not all viable spores germinate and grow under known media conditions, it is difficult to assess a total spore count in a population of bacteria. As such, a measurement of DPA content highly correlates with spore content and is an appropriate measure for characterizing total spore content in a bacterial population. [0119] [Provided are spore populations containing more than one type of bacterium. As used herein, a “type” or more than one “types” of bacteria may be differentiated at the genus level, the species, level, the sub-species level, the strain level or by any other taxonomic method, as described herein and otherwise known in the art. [0120] In some embodiments all or essentially all of the bacterial spores present in a purified population are obtained from a fecal material treated as described herein or otherwise known in the art. In alternative embodiments, one or more than one bacterial spores or types of bacterial spores are generated in culture and combined to form a purified spore population. In other alternative embodiments, one or more of these culture-generated spore populations are combined with a fecal material-derived spore population to generate a hybrid spore population. Bacterial compositions may contain at least two types of these preferred bacteria, including strains of the same species. For instance, a bacterial composition may comprise at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least 17, at least 18, at least 19, or at least 20 or more than 20 types of bacteria, as defined by species or operational taxonomic unit (OTU) encompassing such species. [0121] Thus, provided herein are methods for production of a composition containing a population of bacterial spores suitable for therapeutic administration to a mammalian subject in need thereof. And the composition is produced by generally following the steps of: (a) providing a fecal material obtained from a mammalian donor subject; and (b) subjecting the fecal material to at least one purification treatment or step under conditions such that a population of bacterial spores is produced from the fecal material. The composition is formulated such that a single oral dose contains at least about 1χ104 colony forming units of the bacterial spores, and a single oral dose will typically contain about 1 χ104, 1 χ105, 1 χ106,1 χ107, 1 χ108, 1x109, 1x101°, 1x1011, 1x1012, 1x1013, 1 χ1014, 1x1015, or greater than 1χ1015 CFUs of the bacterial spores. The presence and/or concentration of a given type of bacterial spore may be known or unknown in a given purified spore population. If known, for example the concentration of spores of a given strain, or the aggregate of all strains, is e.g., 1x104, 1x105, 1x106, 1x107, 1x108, 1x109, 1x101°, 1x1011, 1x1012, 1x1013, 1 χ1014, 1 χ1015, or greater than 1 χ1015 viable bacterial spores per gram of composition or per administered dose. [0122] In some formulations, the composition contains at least about 0.5%, 1 %, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or greater than 90% spores on a mass basis. In some formulations, the administered dose does not exceed 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 milligrams or 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, or 1.9 grams in mass. [0123] The bacterial spore compositions are generally formulated for oral or gastric administration, typically to a mammalian subject. In particular embodiments, the composition is formulated for oral administration as a solid, semi-solid, gel, or liquid form, such as in the form of a pill, tablet, capsule, or lozenge. In some embodiments, such formulations contain or are coated by an enteric coating to protect the bacteria through the stomach and small intestine, although spores are generally resistant to the stomach and small intestines. In other embodiments, the bacterial spore compositions may be formulated with a germinant to enhance engraftment, or efficacy. In yet other embodiments, the bacterial spore compositions may be co-formulated or co-administered with prebiotic substances, to enhance engraftment or efficacy. [0124] The bacterial spore compositions may be formulated to be effective in a given mammalian subject in a single administration or over multiple administrations. For example, a single administration is substantially effective to reduce Cl. difficile and/or Cl. difficile toxin content in a mammalian subject to whom the composition is administered. Substantially effective means that Cl. difficile and/or Cl. difficile toxin content in the subject is reduced by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or greater than 99% following administration of the composition. Alternatively, efficacy may be measured by the absence of diarrheal symptoms or the absence of carriage of C. difficile or C. difficile toxin after 2 day, 4 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks or longer than 8 weeks. Bacterial Compositions [0125] Provided are bacteria and combinations of bacteria of the human gut microbiota with the capacity to meaningfully provide functions of a healthy microbiota when administered to mammalian hosts. Without being limited to a specific mechanism, it is thought that such compositions inhibit the growth, proliferation, and/or colonization of one or a plurality of pathogenic bacteria in the dysbiotic microbiotal niche, so that a healthy, diverse and protective microbiota colonizes and populates the intestinal lumen to establish or reestablish ecological control over pathogens or potential pathogens (e.g., some bacteria are pathogenic bacteria only when present in a dysbiotic environment). Inhibition of pathogens includes those pathogens such as C. difficile, Salmonella spp., enteropathogenic Ε coli, multi-drug resistant bacteria such as Klebsiella, and Ε. coli, Carbapenem-resistent Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), extended spectrum beta-lactam resistant Enterococci (ESBL), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). [0126] As used herein, a “type” or more than one “types” of bacteria may be differentiated at the genus level, the species, level, the sub-species level, the strain level or by any other taxonomic method, as described herein and otherwise known in the art. [0127] Bacterial compositions may comprise two types of bacteria (termed “binary combinations” or “binary pairs”) or greater than two types of bacteria. For instance, a bacterial composition may comprise at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least 17, at least 18, at least 19, at least 20, or at least 21,22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 30, 31,32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or at least 40, at least 50 or greater than 50 types of bacteria, as defined by species or operational taxonomic unit (OTU), or otherwise as provided herein.

Inhibition of Bacterial Pathogens [0155] In some embodiments, the bacterial composition provides a protective or therapeutic effect against infection by one or more Gl pathogens of interest. [0156] A list of exemplary bacterial pathogens is provided in Table 1 as indicated by pathogen status. [0157] In some embodiments, the pathogenic bacterium is selected from the group consisting of Yersinia, Vibrio, Treponema, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Shigella, Salmonella, Rickettsia, Orientia, Pseudomonas, Neisseria, Mycoplasma, Mycobacterium, Listeria, Leptospira, Legionella, Klebsiella, Flelicobacter, Flaemophilus, Francisella, Escherichia, Ehrlichia, Enterococcus, Coxiella, Corynebacterium, Clostridium, Chlamydia, Chlamydophila, Campylobacter, Burkholderia, Brucella, Borrelia, Bordetella, Bifidobacterium , Bacillus, multi-drug resistant bacteria, extended spectrum beta-lactam resistant Enterococci (ESBL), Carbapenem-resistent Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). [0158] In some embodiments, these pathogens include, but are not limited to, Aeromonas hydrophila, Campylobacter fetus, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, enteroaggregative Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (such as, but not limited to, LT and/or ST), Escherichia coli 0157:Η7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiellia pneumonia, Lysteria monocytogenes, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Salmonella spp., Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella spp., Staphylococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp., Vibrio spp., Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, and Yersinia enterocolitica. [0159] In one embodiment, the pathogen of interest is at least one pathogen chosen from Clostridium difficile, Salmonella spp., pathogenic Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., and extended spectrum beta-lactam resistant Enterococci (ESBL). Purified Spore Populations [0160] In some embodiments, the bacterial compositions comprise purified spore populations. Purified spore populations contain combinations of commensal bacteria of the human gut microbiota with the capacity to meaningfully provide functions of a healthy microbiota when administered to a mammalian subject. Without being limited to a specific mechanism, it is thought that such compositions inhibit the growth of a pathogen such as C. difficile, Salmonella spp., enteropathogenic Ε. coli, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., so that a healthy, diverse and protective microbiota can be maintained or, in the case of pathogenic bacterial infections such as C. difficile infection, repopulate the intestinal lumen to reestablish ecological control over potential pathogens. In some embodiments, yeast spores and other fungal spores are also purified and selected for therapeutic use. [0161] Disclosed herein are therapeutic compositions containing ηοηpathogenic, germination-competent bacterial spores, for the prevention, control, and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, disorders and conditions and for general nutritional health. These compositions are advantageous in being suitable for safe administration to humans and other mammalian subjects and are efficacious in numerous gastrointestinal diseases, disorders and conditions and in general nutritional health. While spore-based compositions are known, these are generally prepared according to various techniques such as lyophilization or spray-drying of liquid bacterial cultures, resulting in poor efficacy, instability, substantial variability and lack of adequate safety. [0162] It has now been found that populations of bacterial spores can be obtained from biological materials obtained from mammalian subjects, including humans. These populations are formulated into compositions as provided herein, and administered to mammalian subjects using the methods as provided herein. [0163] Provided herein are therapeutic compositions containing a purified population of bacterial spores. As used herein, the terms “purify”, “purified” and “purifying” refer to the state of a population (e.g., a plurality of known or unknown amount and/or concentration) of desired bacterial spores, that have undergone one or more processes of purification, e.g., a selection or an enrichment of the desired bacterial spore, or alternatively a removal or reduction of residual habitat products as described herein. In some embodiments, a purified population has no detectable undesired activity or, alternatively, the level or amount of the undesired activity is at or below an acceptable level or amount. In other embodiments, a purified population has an amount and/or concentration of desired bacterial spores at or above an acceptable amount and/or concentration. In other embodiments, the purified population of bacterial spores is enriched as compared to the starting material (e.g., a fecal material) from which the population is obtained. This enrichment may be by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, 99.9999%, or greater than 99.9999% as compared to the starting material. [0164] In certain embodiments, the purified populations of bacterial spores have reduced or undetectable levels of one or more pathogenic activities, such as toxicity, an infection of the mammalian recipient subject, an immunomodulatory activity, an autoimmune response, a metabolic response, or an inflammatory response or a neurological response. Such a reduction in a pathogenic activity may be by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, 99.9999%, or greater than 99.9999% as compared to the starting material. In other embodiments, the purified populations of bacterial spores have reduced sensory components as compared to fecal material, such as reduced odor, taste, appearance, and umami. [0165] Provided are purified populations of bacterial spores that are substantially free of residual habitat products. In certain embodiments, this means that the bacterial spore composition no longer contains a substantial amount of the biological matter associated with the microbial community while living on or in the human or animal subject, and the purified population of spores may be 100% free, 99% free, 98% free, 97% free, 96% free, or 95% free of any contamination of the biological matter associated with the microbial community. Substantially free of residual habitat products may also mean that the bacterial spore composition contains no detectable cells from a human or animal, and that only microbial cells are detectable, in particular, only desired microbial cells are detectable. In another embodiment, it means that fewer than 1x10'2%, 1x10'3%, 1x10'4%, 1x10'5%, 1x10'6%, 1x10'7%, 1x10'8% of the cells in the bacterial composition are human or animal, as compared to microbial cells. In another embodiment, the residual habitat product present in the purified population is reduced at least a certain level from the fecal material obtained from the mammalian donor subject, e.g., reduced by at least about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, 99.9999%, or greater than 99.9999%. [0166] In one embodiment, substantially free of residual habitat products or substantially free of a detectable level of a pathogenic material means that the bacterial composition contains no detectable viral (including bacterial viruses (i.e., phage)), fungal, or mycoplasmal or toxoplasmal contaminants, or a eukaryotic parasite such as a helminth. Alternatively, the purified spore populations are substantially free of an acellular material, e.g., DNA, viral coat material, or non-viable bacterial material. [0167] As described herein, purified spore populations can be demonstrated by genetic analysis (e.g., PCR, DNA sequencing), serology and antigen analysis, and methods using instrumentation such as flow cytometry with reagents that distinguish desired bacterial spores from non-desired, contaminating materials. [0168] Exemplary biological materials include fecal materials such as feces or materials isolated from the various segments of the small and large intestines. Fecal materials are obtained from a mammalian donor subject, or can be obtained from more than one donor subject, e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 750, 1000 or from greater than 1000 donors, where such materials are then pooled prior to purification of the desired bacterial spores. [0169] In alternative embodiments, the desired bacterial spores are purified from a single fecal material sample obtained from a single donor, and after such purification are combined with purified spore populations from other purifications, either from the same donor at a different time, or from one or more different donors, or both. [0170] Preferred bacterial genera include Acetonema, Alkaliphilus, Alicyclobacillus, Amphibacillus, Ammonifex, Anaerobacter, Anaerofustis, Anaerostipes, Anaerotruncus, Anoxybacillus, Bacillus, Blautia, Brevibacillus, Bryantella, Caldicellulosiruptor, Caloramator, Candidatus, Carboxydibrachium, Carboxydothermus, Clostridium, Cohnella, Coprococcus, Dendrosporobacter Desulfitobacterium, Desulfosporosinus, Desulfotomaculum, Dorea, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium, Filifactor, Geobacillus, Flalobacteroides, Heliobacillus, Fleliobacterium, Heliophilum, Heliorestis, Lachnoanaerobaculum, Lysinibacillus, Moorella, Oceanobacillus, Orenia (S.), Oxalophagus, Oxobacter, Paenibacillus, Pelospora, Pelotomaculum, Propionispora, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Sarcina, Sporobacterium, Sporohalobacter, Sporolactobacillus, Sporomusa, Sporosarcina, Sporotomaculum, Subdoligranulum, Symbiobacterium, Syntrophobotulus, Syntrophospora, Terribacillus, Thermoanaerobacter, and Thermosinus. [0171] Preferred bacterial species are provided at Table Χ4. Where specific strains of a species are provided, one of skill in the art will recognize that other strains of the species can be substituted for the named strain. [0172] In some embodiments, spore-forming bacteria are identified by the presence of nucleic acid sequences that modulate sporulation. In particular, signature sporulation genes are highly conserved across members of distantly related genera including Clostridium and Bacillus. Traditional approaches of forward genetics have identified many, if not all, genes that are essential for sporulation (spo). The developmental program of sporulation is governed in part by the successive action of four compartment-specific sigma factors (appearing in the order oF, σΕ, oG and σΚ), whose activities are confined to the forespore (oF and oG) or the mother cell (σΕ and σΚ). [0173] Provided are spore populations containing more than one type of bacterium. As used herein, a “type” or more than one “types” of bacteria may be differentiated at the genus level, the species, level, the sub-species level, the strain level or by any other taxonomic method, as described herein and otherwise known in the art. [0174] In some embodiments, all or essentially all of the bacterial spores present in a purified population are obtained from a fecal material treated as described herein or otherwise known in the art. In alternative embodiments, one or more than one bacterial spores or types of bacterial spores are generated in culture and combined to form a purified spore population. In other alternative embodiments, one or more of these culture-generated spore populations are combined with a fecal material-derived spore population to generate a hybrid spore population. Bacterial compositions may contain at least two types of these preferred bacteria, including strains of the same species. For instance, a bacterial composition may comprise at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least 17, at least 18, at least 19, or at least 20 or more than 20 types of bacteria, as defined by species or operational taxonomic unit (OTU) encompassing such species. [0175] Thus, provided herein are methods for production of a composition containing a population of bacterial spores suitable for therapeutic administration to a mammalian subject in need thereof. And the composition is produced by generally following the steps of: (a) providing a fecal material obtained from a mammalian donor subject; and (b) subjecting the fecal material to at least one purification treatment or step under conditions such that a population of bacterial spores is produced from the fecal material. The composition is formulated such that a single oral dose contains at least about 1χ104 colony forming units of the bacterial spores, and a single oral dose will typically contain about 1 χ104, 1 χ105, 1 χ106,1 χ107, 1 χ108, 1x109, 1x101°, 1x1011, 1x1012, 1x1013, 1x1014, 1x1015, or greater than 1χ1015 CFUs of the bacterial spores. The presence and/or concentration of a given type of bacteria spore may be known or unknown in a given purified spore population. If known, for example the concentration of spores of a given strain, or the aggregate of all strains, is e.g., 1x104, 1x105, 1x106, 1x107, 1x108, 1x109, 1x101°, 1x1011, 1x1012, 1x1013, 1 χ1014, 1 χ1015, or greater than 1 χ1015 viable bacterial spores per gram of composition or per administered dose. [0176] In some formulations, the composition contains at least about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or greater than 90% spores on a mass basis. In some formulations, the administered dose does not exceed 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 milligrams or 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, or 1.9 grams in mass. [0177] The bacterial spore compositions are generally formulated for oral or gastric administration, typically to a mammalian subject. In particular embodiments, the composition is formulated for oral administration as a solid, semi-solid, gel, or liquid form, such as in the form of a pill, tablet, capsule, or lozenge. In some embodiments, such formulations contain or are coated by an enteric coating to protect the bacteria through the stomach and small intestine, although spores are generally resistant to the stomach and small intestines. [0178] The bacterial spore compositions may be formulated to be effective in a given mammalian subject in a single administration or over multiple administrations. For example, a single administration is substantially effective to reduce Cl. difficile and/or Cl. difficile toxin content in a mammalian subject to whom the composition is administered. Substantially effective means that Cl. difficile and/or Cl. difficile toxin content in the subject is reduced by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or greater than 99% following administration of the composition. METHODS OF THE INVENTION Methods for Determining 16S Sequences [0179] OTUs can be defined either by full 16S sequencing of the rRNA gene, by sequencing of a specific hypervariable region of this gene (i.e. V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, or V9), or by sequencing of any combination of hypervariable regions from this gene (e.g. V1-3 or V3-5). The bacterial 16S rDNA is approximately 1500 nucleotides in length and is used in reconstructing the evolutionary relationships and sequence similarity of one bacterial isolate to another using phylogenetic approaches. 16S sequences are used for phylogenetic reconstruction as they are in general highly conserved, but contain specific hypervariable regions that harbor sufficient nucleotide diversity to differentiate genera and species of most microbes. [0180] Using well known techniques, in order to determine the full 16S sequence or the sequence of any hypervariable region of the 16S sequence, genomic DNA is extracted from a bacterial sample, the 16S rDNA (full region or specific hypervariable regions) amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the PCR products cleaned, and nucleotide sequences delineated to determine the genetic composition of 16S gene or subdomain of the gene. If full 16S sequencing is performed, the sequencing method used may be, but is not limited to, Sanger sequencing. If one or more hypervariable regions are used, such as the V4 region, the sequencing can be, but is not limited to being, performed using the Sanger method or using a nextgeneration sequencing method, such as an lllumina (sequencing by synthesis) method using barcoded primers allowing for multiplex reactions. [0181] OTUs can be defined by a combination of nucleotide markers or genes, in particular highly conserved genes (e.g., “house-keeping” genes), or a combination thereof, full-genome sequence, or partial genome sequence generated using amplified genetic products, or whole genome sequence (WGS). Using well defined methods DNA extracted from a bacterial sample will have specific genomic regions amplified using PCR and sequenced to determine the nucleotide sequence of the amplified products. In the whole genome shotgun (WGS) method, extracted DNA will be directly sequenced without amplification. Sequence data can be generated using any sequencing technology including, but not limited to Sanger, lllumina, 454 Life Sciences, Ion Torrent, ABI, Pacific Biosciences, and/or Oxford Nanopore. Methods for Preparing a Bacterial Composition for Administration to a Subject [0182] Methods for producing bacterial compositions can include three main processing steps, combined with one or more mixing steps. The steps include organism banking, organism production, and preservation. [0183] For banking, the strains included in the bacterial composition may be (1) isolated directly from a specimen or taken from a banked stock, (2) optionally cultured on a nutrient agar or broth that supports growth to generate viable biomass, and (3) the biomass optionally preserved in multiple aliquots in long-term storage. [0184] In embodiments that use a culturing step, the agar or broth can contain nutrients that provide essential elements and specific factors that enable growth. An example would be a medium composed of 20 g/L glucose, 10 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L soy peptone, 2 g/L citric acid, 1.5 g/L sodium phosphate monobasic, 100 mg/L ferric ammonium citrate, 80 mg/L magnesium sulfate, 10 mg/L hemin chloride, 2 mg/L calcium chloride, 1 mg/L menadione. A variety of microbiological media and variations are well known in the art (e.g. R.M. Atlas, Handbook of Microbiological Media (2010) CRC Press). Medium can be added to the culture at the start, may be added during the culture, or may be intermittently/continuously flowed through the culture. The strains in the bacterial composition may be cultivated alone, as a subset of the bacterial composition, or as an entire collection comprising the bacterial composition. As an example, a first strain may be cultivated together with a second strain in a mixed continuous culture, at a dilution rate lower than the maximum growth rate of either cell to prevent the culture from washing out of the cultivation. [0185] The inoculated culture is incubated under favorable conditions for a time sufficient to build biomass. For bacterial compositions for human use, this is often at 37°C temperature, pH, and other parameter with values similar to the normal human niche. The environment can be actively controlled, passively controlled (e.g., via buffers), or allowed to drift. For example, for anaerobic bacterial compositions (e.g., gut microbiota), an anoxic/reducing environment can be employed. This can be accomplished by addition of reducing agents such as cysteine to the broth, and/or stripping it of oxygen. As an example, a culture of a bacterial composition can be grown at 37°C, pH 7, in the medium above, pre-reduced with 1 g/L cysteine HCI. [0186] When the culture has generated sufficient biomass, it can be preserved for banking. The organisms can be placed into a chemical milieu that protects from freezing (adding ‘cryoprotectants’), drying (‘lyoprotectants’), and/or osmotic shock (‘osmoprotectants’), dispensing into multiple (optionally identical) containers to create a uniform bank, and then treating the culture for preservation. Containers are generally impermeable and have closures that assure isolation from the environment. Cryopreservation treatment is accomplished by freezing a liquid at ultra-low temperatures (e.g., at or below -80°C). Dried preservation removes water from the culture by evaporation (in the case of spray drying or ‘cool drying’) or by sublimation (e.g., for freeze drying, spray freeze drying). Removal of water improves long-term bacterial composition storage stability at temperatures elevated above cryogenic. If the bacterial composition comprises spore forming species and results in the production of spores, the final composition can be purified by additional means, such as density gradient centrifugation preserved using the techniques described above. Bacterial composition banking can be done by culturing and preserving the strains individually, or by mixing the strains together to create a combined bank. As an example of cryopreservation, a bacterial composition culture can be harvested by centrifugation to pellet the cells from the culture medium, the supernate decanted and replaced with fresh culture broth containing 15% glycerol. The culture can then be aliquoted into 1 ml. cryotubes, sealed, and placed at -80°C for long-term viability retention. This procedure achieves acceptable viability upon recovery from frozen storage. [0187] Organism production can be conducted using similar culture steps to banking, including medium composition and culture conditions. It can be conducted at larger scales of operation, especially for clinical development or commercial production. At larger scales, there can be several subcultivations of the bacterial composition prior to the final cultivation. At the end of cultivation, the culture is harvested to enable further formulation into a dosage form for administration. This can involve concentration, removal of undesirable medium components, and/or introduction into a chemical milieu that preserves the bacterial composition and renders it acceptable for administration via the chosen route. For example, a bacterial composition can be cultivated to a concentration of 1010 CFU/mL, then concentrated 20-fold by tangential flow microfiltration; the spent medium can be exchanged by diafiltering with a preservative medium consisting of 2% gelatin, 100 η∩Μ trehalose, and 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer. The suspension can then be freeze-dried to a powder and titrated. [0188] After drying, the powder can be blended to an appropriate potency, and mixed with other cultures and/or a filler such as microcrystalline cellulose for consistency and ease of handling, and the bacterial composition formulated as provided herein. Administration of Bacterial Compositions. [0189] The bacterial compositions of the invention are suitable for administration to mammals and non-mammalian animals in need thereof. In certain embodiments, the mammalian subject is a human subject who has one or more symptoms of a dysbiosis, including but not limited to overgrowth of an undesired pathobiont or pathogen, reduced representation of key bacterial taxa such as the Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes or genera or species thereof, or reduced diversity of microbial species compared to a healthy individual, or reduced overall abundance of anaerobic bacteria. [0190] When the mammalian subject is suffering from a disease, disorder or condition characterized by an aberrant microbiota, the bacterial compositions described herein are suitable for treatment thereof. In some embodiments, the mammalian subject has not received antibiotics in advance of treatment with the bacterial compositions. For example, the mammalian subject has not been administered at least two doses of vancomycin, metronidazole and/or or similar antibiotic compound within one week prior to administration of the therapeutic composition. In other embodiments, the mammalian subject has not previously received an antibiotic compound in the one month prior to administration of the therapeutic composition. In other embodiments, the mammalian subject has received one or more treatments with one or more different antibiotic compounds and such treatment(s) resulted in no improvement or a worsening of symptoms. In some embodiments, the spore composition is administered following a successful course of antibiotics to prevent dysbiosis and enhance recovery of a diverse, healthy mi era biota. [0191] In some embodiments, the gastrointestinal disease, disorder or condition is diarrhea caused by C. difficile including recurrent C. difficile infection, ulcerative colitis, colitis, Crohn’s disease, or irritable bowel disease. Beneficially, the therapeutic composition is administered only once prior to improvement of the disease, disorder or condition. In some embodiments the therapeutic composition is administered at intervals greater than two days, such as once every three, four, five or six days, or every week or less frequently than every week. Or the preparation may be administered intermittently according to a set schedule, e.g., once a day, once weekly, or once monthly, or when the subject relapses from the primary illness. In another embodiment, the preparation may be administered on a long-term basis to individuals who are at risk for infection with or who may be carriers of these pathogens, including individuals who will have an invasive medical procedure (such as surgery), who will be hospitalized, who live in a long-term care or rehabilitation facility, who are exposed to pathogens by virtue of their profession (livestock and animal processing workers), or who could be carriers of pathogens (including hospital workers such as physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals). [0192] Also provided are methods of treating or preventing a mammalian subject suffering from or at risk of developing a metabolic disease, and disorder or condition selected from the group consisting of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, heart disease, autoimmune disease, liver disease, and autism using the therapeutic compositions provided herein. [0193] In embodiments, the bacterial spore composition is administered enterically. This preferentially includes oral administration, or by an oral or nasal tube (including nasogastric, nasojejunal, oral gastric, or oral jejunal). In other embodiments, administration includes rectal administration (including enema, suppository, or colonoscopy). The bacterial composition may be administered to at least one region of the gastrointestinal tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. In some embodiments, it is administered to all regions of the gastrointestinal tract. The bacterial compositions may be administered orally in the form of medicaments such as powders, capsules, tablets, gels or liquids. The bacterial compositions may also be administered in gel or liquid form by the oral route or through a nasogastric tube, or by the rectal route in a gel or liquid form, by enema or instillation through a colonoscope or by a suppository. [0194] If the composition is administered colonoscopically and, optionally, if the bacterial composition is administered by other rectal routes (such as an enema or suppository) or even if the subject has an oral administration, the subject may have a colonic-cleansing preparation. The colon-cleansing preparation can facilitate proper use of the colonoscope or other administration devices, but even when it does not serve a mechanical purpose it can also maximize the proportion of the bacterial composition relative to the other organisms previously residing in the gastrointestinal tract of the subject. Any ordinarily acceptable colonic-cleansing preparation may be used such as those typically provided when a subject undergoes a colonoscopy. [0195] To evaluate the subject, symptoms of dysbiosis are evaluated post treatment ranging from 1 day to 6 months after administration of the purified spore population. Fecal material is collected during this period and the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract can be assessed by 16S rDNA or metagenomic sequencing analysis or other analyses commonly used by the skilled artisan. Repopulation by species provided by the spore population as well as Augmentation by commensal microbes not present in the spore population will occur in this time as the spore population catalyzes a reshaping of the gut ecology to a state of healthy biosis. The specification is most thoroughly understood in light of the teachings of the references cited within the specification. The embodiments within the specification provide an illustration of embodiments and should not be construed to limit the scope. The skilled artisan readily recognizes that many other embodiments are encompassed. All publications and patents cited in this disclosure are incorporated by reference in their entirety. To the extent the material incorporated by reference contradicts or is inconsistent with this specification, the specification will supersede any such material. The citation of any references herein is not an admission that such references are prior art. Methods of Treating a Subject [0196] In some embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein are administered to a patient or a user (sometimes collectively referred to as a “subject”). As used herein “administer” and “administration” encompasses embodiments in which one person directs another to consume a bacterial composition in a certain manner and/or for a certain purpose, and also situations in which a user uses a bacteria composition in a certain manner and/or for a certain purpose independently of or in variance to any instructions received from a second person. Non-limiting examples of embodiments in which one person directs another to consume a bacterial composition in a certain manner and/or for a certain purpose include when a physician prescribes a course of conduct and/or treatment to a patient, when a parent commands a minor user (such as a child) to consume a bacterial composition, when a trainer advises a user (such as an athlete) to follow a particular course of conduct and/or treatment, and when a manufacturer, distributer, or marketer recommends conditions of use to an end user, for example through advertisements or labeling on packaging or on other materials provided in association with the sale or marketing of a product. [0197] The bacterial compositions offer a protective and/or therapeutic effect against infection by one or more Gl pathogens of interest and can be administered after an acute case of infection has been resolved in order to prevent relapse, during an acute case of infection as a complement to antibiotic therapy if the bacterial composition is not sensitive to the same antibiotics as the Gl pathogen, or to prevent infection or reduce transmission from disease carriers. [0198] The present bacterial compositions can be useful in a variety of clinical situations. For example, the bacterial compositions can be administered as a complementary treatment to antibiotics when a patient is suffering from an acute infection, to reduce the risk of recurrence after an acute infection has subsided, or when a patient will be in close proximity to others with or at risk of serious gastrointestinal infections (physicians, nurses, hospital workers, family members of those who are ill or hospitalized). [0199] The present bacterial compositions can be administered to animals, including humans, laboratory animals (e.g., primates, rats, mice), livestock (e.g., cows, sheep, goats, pigs, turkeys, chickens), and household pets (e.g., dogs, cats, rodents). [0200] In the present method, the bacterial composition can be administered enterically, in other words, by a route of access to the gastrointestinal tract. This includes oral administration, rectal administration (including enema, suppository, or colonoscopy), by an oral or nasal tube (nasogastric, nasojejunal, oral gastric, or oral jejunal), as detailed more fully herein. Pretreatment Protocols [0201] Prior to administration of the bacterial composition, the patient can optionally have a pretreatment protocol to prepare the gastrointestinal tract to receive the bacterial composition. In certain embodiments, the pretreatment protocol is advisable, such as when a patient has an acute infection with a highly resilient pathogen. In other embodiments, the pretreatment protocol is entirely optional, such as when the pathogen causing the infection is not resilient, or the patient has had an acute infection that has been successfully treated but where the physician is concerned that the infection may recur. In these instances, the pretreatment protocol can enhance the ability of the bacterial composition to affect the patient’s microbiome. [0202] As one way of preparing the patient for administration of the microbial ecosystem, at least one antibiotic can be administered to alter the bacteria in the patient. As another way of preparing the patient for administration of the microbial ecosystem, a standard colon-cleansing preparation can be administered to the patient to substantially empty the contents of the colon, such as used to prepare a patient for a colonscopy. By “substantially emptying the contents of the colon,” this application means removing at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or about 100% of the contents of the ordinary volume of colon contents. Antibiotic treatment can precede the colon-cleansing protocol. [0203] If a patient has received an antibiotic for treatment of an infection, or if a patient has received an antibiotic as part of a specific pretreatment protocol, in one embodiment, the antibiotic can be stopped in sufficient time to allow the antibiotic to be substantially reduced in concentration in the gut before the bacterial composition is administered. In one embodiment, the antibiotic can be discontinued 1,2, or 3 days before the administration of the bacterial composition. In another embodiment, the antibiotic can be discontinued 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 antibiotic half-lives before administration of the bacterial composition. In another embodiment, the antibiotic can be chosen so the constituents in the bacterial composition have an MIC50 that is higher than the concentration of the antibiotic in the gut. [0204] MIC50 of a bacterial composition or the elements in the composition can be determined by methods well known in the art. Reller et al., Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing: A Review of General Principles and Contemporary Practices, Clinical Infectious Diseases 49(11):1749-1755 (2009). In such an embodiment, the additional time between antibiotic administration and administration of the bacterial composition is not necessary. If the pretreatment protocol is part of treatment of an acute infection, the antibiotic can be chosen so that the infection is sensitive to the antibiotic, but the constituents in the bacterial composition are not sensitive to the antibiotic. Routes of Administration [0205] The bacterial compositions of the invention are suitable for administration to mammals and non-mammalian animals in need thereof. In certain embodiments, the mammalian subject is a human subject who has one or more symptoms of a dysbiosis. [0206] When a mammalian subject is suffering from a disease, disorder or condition characterized by an aberrant microbiota, the bacterial compositions described herein are suitable for treatment thereof. In some embodiments, the mammalian subject has not received antibiotics in advance of treatment with the bacterial compositions. For example, the mammalian subject has not been administered at least two doses of vancomycin, metronidazole and/or or similar antibiotic compound within one week prior to administration of the therapeutic composition. In other embodiments, the mammalian subject has not previously received an antibiotic compound in the one month prior to administration of the therapeutic composition. In other embodiments, the mammalian subject has received one or more treatments with one or more different antibiotic compounds and such treatment(s) resulted in no improvement or a worsening of symptoms. [0207] In some embodiments, the gastrointestinal disease, disorder or condition is diarrhea caused by C. difficile including recurrent C. difficile infection, ulcerative colitis, colitis, Crohn’s disease, or irritable bowel disease. Beneficially, the therapeutic composition is administered only once prior to improvement of the disease, disorder or condition. In some embodiments, the therapeutic composition is administered at intervals greater than two days, such as once every three, four, five or six days, or every week or less frequently than every week. In other embodiments, the preparation can be administered intermittently according to a set schedule, e.g., once a day, once weekly, or once monthly, or when the subject relapses from the primary illness. In another embodiment, the preparation may be administered on a long-term basis to subjects who are at risk for infection with or who may be carriers of these pathogens, including subjects who will have an invasive medical procedure (such as surgery), who will be hospitalized, who live in a long-term care or rehabilitation facility, who are exposed to pathogens by virtue of their profession (livestock and animal processing workers), or who could be carriers of pathogens (including hospital workers such as physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals). [0208] In certain embodiments, the bacterial composition is administered enterically. This preferentially includes oral administration, or by an oral or nasal tube (including nasogastric, nasojejunal, oral gastric, or oral jejunal). In other embodiments, administration includes rectal administration (including enema, suppository, or colonoscopy). The bacterial composition can be administered to at least one region of the gastrointestinal tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. In some embodiments, it is administered to all regions of the gastrointestinal tract. The bacterial compositions can be administered orally in the form of medicaments such as powders, capsules, tablets, gels or liquids. The bacterial compositions can also be administered in gel or liquid form by the oral route or through a nasogastric tube, or by the rectal route in a gel or liquid form, by enema or instillation through a colonoscope or by a suppository. [0209] If the composition is administered colonoscopically and, optionally, if the bacterial composition is administered by other rectal routes (such as an enema or suppository) or even if the subject has an oral administration, the subject can have a colon-cleansing preparation. The colon-cleansing preparation can facilitate proper use of the colonoscope or other administration devices, but even when it does not serve a mechanical purpose, it can also maximize the proportion of the bacterial composition relative to the other organisms previously residing in the gastrointestinal tract of the subject. Any ordinarily acceptable colon-cleansing preparation may be used such as those typically provided when a subject undergoes a colonoscopy. Dosages and Schedule for Administration [0210] In some embodiments, the bacteria and bacterial compositions are provided in a dosage form. In certain embodiments, the dosage form is designed for administration of at least one OTU or combination thereof disclosed herein, wherein the total amount of bacterial composition administered is selected from 0.1 ng to 10g, 10ng to 1 g, 100ng to 0.1 g, 0.1 mg to 500mg, 1mg to 100mg, or from 10-15mg. In other embodiments, the bacterial composition is consumed at a rate of from 0.1 ng to 10g a day, 10ng to 1g a day, 100ng to 0.1 g a day, 0.1 mg to 500mg a day, 1mg to 100mg a day, or from 10-15mg a day, or more. [0211] In certain embodiments, the treatment period is at least 1 day, at least 2 days, at least 3 days, at least 4 days, at least 5 days, at least 6 days, at least 1 week, at least 2 weeks, at least 3 weeks, at least 4 weeks, at least 1 month, at least 2 months, at least 3 months, at least 4 months, at least 5 months, at least 6 months, or at least 1 year. In some embodiments the treatment period is from 1 day to 1 week, from 1 week to 4 weeks, from 1 month, to 3 months, from 3 months to 6 months, from 6 months to 1 year, or for over a year. [0212] In one embodiment, 105 and 1012 microorganisms total can be administered to the patient in a given dosage form. In another embodiment, an effective amount can be provided in from 1 to 500 ml or from 1 to 500 grams of the bacterial composition having from 107 to 1011 bacteria per ml or per gram, or a capsule, tablet or suppository having from 1 mg to 1000 mg lyophilized powder having from 107 to 1011 bacteria. Those receiving acute treatment can receive higher doses than those who are receiving chronic administration (such as hospital workers or those admitted into long-term care facilities). [0213] Any of the preparations described herein can be administered once on a single occasion or on multiple occasions, such as once a day for several days or more than once a day on the day of administration (including twice daily, three times daily, or up to five times daily). In another embodiment, the preparation can be administered intermittently according to a set schedule, e.g., once weekly, once monthly, or when the patient relapses from the primary illness. In one embodiment, the preparation can be administered on a long-term basis to individuals who are at risk for infection with or who may be carriers of these pathogens, including individuals who will have an invasive medical procedure (such as surgery), who will be hospitalized, who live in a long-term care or rehabilitation facility, who are exposed to pathogens by virtue of their profession (livestock and animal processing workers), or who could be carriers of pathogens (including hospital workers such as physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals). Patient Selection [0214] Particular bacterial compositions can be selected for individual patients or for patients with particular profiles. For example, 16S sequencing can be performed for a given patient to identify the bacteria present in his or her microbiota. The sequencing can either profile the patient’s entire microbiome using 16S sequencing (to the family, genera, or species level), a portion of the patient’s microbiome using 16S sequencing, or it can be used to detect the presence or absence of specific candidate bacteria that are biomarkers for health or a particular disease state, such as markers of multi-drug resistant organisms or specific genera of concern such as Escherichia. Based on the biomarker data, a particular composition can be selected for administration to a patient to supplement or complement a patient’s microbiota in order to restore health or treat or prevent disease. In another embodiment, patients can be screened to determine the composition of their microbiota to determine the likelihood of successful treatment. Combination Therapy [0215] The bacterial compositions can be administered with other agents in a combination therapy mode, including anti-microbial agents and prebiotics. Administration can be sequential, over a period of hours or days, or simultaneous. [0216] In one embodiment, the bacterial compositions are included in combination therapy with one or more anti-microbial agents, which include anti-bacterial agents, anti-fungal agents, anti-viral agents and anti-parasitic agents. [0217] Anti-bacterial agents can include cephalosporin antibiotics (cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefadroxil, cefazolin, cephalothin, cefaclor, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefprozil, and ceftobiprole); fluoroquinolone antibiotics (cipro, Levaquin, floxin, tequin, avelox, and norflox); tetracycline antibiotics (tetracycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline, and doxycycline); penicillin antibiotics (amoxicillin, ampicillin, penicillin V, dicloxacillin, carbenicillin, vancomycin, and methicillin); and carbapenem antibiotics (ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem/cilastatin, and meropenem).

Prebiotics include, but are not limited to, amino acids, biotin, fructooligosaccharide, galactooligosaccharides, inulin, lactulose, mannan oligosaccharides, oligofructose-enriched inulin, oligofructose, oligodextrose, tagatose, trans-galactooligosaccharide, and xylooligosaccharides. Methods for Testing Bacterial Compositions for Populating Effect In Vivo Assay for Determining Whether a Bacterial Composition Populates a Subject’s Gastrointestinal Tract [0222] In order to determine that the bacterial composition populates the gastrointestinal tract of a subject, an animal model, such as a mouse model, can be used. The model can begin by evaluating the microbiota of the mice. Qualitative assessments can be accomplished using 16S profiling of the microbial community in the feces of normal mice. It can also be accomplished by full genome sequencing, whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS), or traditional microbiological techniques. Quantitative assessments can be conducted using quantitative PCR (qPCR), described below, or by using traditional microbiological techniques and counting colony formation. [0223] Optionally, the mice can receive an antibiotic treatment to mimic the condition of dysbiosis. Antibiotic treatment can decrease the taxonomic richness, diversity, and evenness of the community, including a reduction of abundance of a significant number of bacterial taxa. Dethlefsen et al., The pervasive effects of an antibiotic on the human gut microbiota, as revealed by deep 16S rRNA sequencing, PLoS Biology 6(11 ):3280 (2008). At least one antibiotic can be used, and antibiotics are well known. Antibiotics can include aminoglycoside antibiotic (amikacin, arbekacin,gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, netilmicin, paromomycin, rhodostreptomycin, streptomycin, tobramycin, and apramycin), amoxicillin, ampicillin, Augmentin (an amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium combination), cephalosporin (cefaclor, defadroxil, cefazolin, cefixime, fefoxitin, cefprozil, ceftazimdime, cefuroxime, cephalexin), clavulanate potassium, clindamycin, colistin, gentamycin, kanamycin, metronidazole, or vancomycin. As an individual, nonlimiting specific example, the mice can be provided with drinking water containing a mixture of the antibiotics kanamycin, colistin, gentamycin, metronidazole and vancomycin at 40 mg/kg, 4.2 mg/kg, 3.5 mg/kg, 21.5 mg/kg, and 4.5 mg/kg (mg per average mouse body weight), respectively, for 7 days. Alternatively, mice can be administered ciprofloxacin at a dose of 15-20 mg/kg (mg per average mouse body weight), for 7 days. If the mice are provided with an antibiotic, a wash out period of from one day to three days may be provided with no antibiotic treatment and no bacterial composition treatment. [0224] Subsequently, the test bacterial composition is administered to the mice by oral gavage. The test bacterial composition may be administered in a volume of 0.2 ml containing 104 CFUs of each type of bacteria in the bacterial composition. Dose-response may be assessed by using a range of doses, including, but not limited to 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, and/or 1010. [0225] The mice can be evaluated using 16S sequencing, full genome sequencing, whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS), or traditional microbiological techniques to determine whether the test bacterial composition has populated the gastrointestinal tract of the mice. For example only, one day, three days, one week, two weeks, and one month after administration of the bacterial composition to the mice, 16S profiling is conducted to determine whether the test bacterial composition has populated the gastrointestinal tract of the mice. Quantitative assessments, including qPCR and traditional microbiological techniques such as colony counting, can additionally or alternatively be performed, at the same time intervals. [0226] Furthermore, the number of sequence counts that correspond exactly to those in the bacterial composition overtime can be assessed to determine specifically which components of the bacterial composition reside in the gastrointestinal tract over a particular period of time. In one embodiment, the strains of the bacterial composition persist for a desired period of time. In another embodiment, the components of the bacterial composition persist for a desired period of time, while also increasing the ability of other microbes (such as those present in the environment, food, etc.) to populate the gastrointestinal tract, further increasing overall diversity, as discussed below. Ability of Bacterial compositions to Populate Different Regions of the Gastrointestinal Tract [0227] The present bacterial compositions can also be assessed for their ability to populate different regions on the gastrointestinal tract. In one embodiment, a bacterial composition can be chosen for its ability to populate one or more than one region of the gastrointestinal tract, including, but not limited to the stomach, the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), the large intestine (the cecum, the colon (the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon), and the rectum). [0228] An in vivo study can be conducted to determine which regions of the gastrointestinal tract a given bacterial composition will populate. A mouse model similar to the one described above can be conducted, except instead of assessing the feces produced by the mice, particular regions of the gastrointestinal tract can be removed and studied individually. For example, at least one particular region of the gastrointestinal tract can be removed and a qualitative or quantitative determination can be performed on the contents of that region of the gastrointestinal tract. In another embodiment, the contents can optionally be removed and the qualitative or quantitative determination may be conducted on the tissue removed from the mouse. aPCR [0229] As one quantitative method for determining whether a bacterial composition populates the gastrointestinal tract, quantitative PCR (qPCR) can be performed. Standard techniques can be followed to generate a standard curve for the bacterial composition of interest, either for all of the components of the bacterial composition collectively, individually, or in subsets (if applicable). Genomic DNA can be extracted from samples using commercially-available kits, such as the Mo Bio Powersoil®-htp 96 Well Soil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA), the Mo Bio Powersoil® DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA), or the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. [0230] In some embodiments, qPCR can be conducted using HotMasterMix (5PRIME, Gaithersburg, MD) and primers specific for the bacterial composition of interest, and may be conducted on a MicroAmp® Fast Optical 96-well Reaction Plate with Barcode (0.1 mL) (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and performed on a BioRad C1000™ Thermal Cycler equipped with a CFX96™ Real-Time System (BioRad, Hercules, CA), with fluorescent readings of the FAM and ROX channels. The Cq value for each well on the FAM channel is determined by the CFX Manager™ software version 2.1. The logio(cfu/ml) of each experimental sample is calculated by inputting a given sample’s Cq value into linear regression model generated from the standard curve comparing the Cq values of the standard curve wells to the known logio(cfu/ml) of those samples. The skilled artisan may employ alternative qPCR modes. Methods for Characterization of Bacterial Compositions [0231] In certain embodiments, provided are methods for testing certain characteristics of bacterial compositions. For example, the sensitivity of bacterial compositions to certain environmental variables is determined, e.g., in order to select for particular desirable characteristics in a given composition, formulation and/or use. For example, the constituents in the bacterial composition can be tested for pH resistance, bile acid resistance, and/or antibiotic sensitivity, either individually on a constituent-by-constituent basis or collectively as a bacterial composition comprised of multiple bacterial constituents (collectively referred to in this section as bacterial composition). pH Sensitivity Testing [0232] If a bacterial composition will be administered other than to the colon or rectum (i.e., for example, an oral route), optionally testing for pH resistance enhances the selection of bacterial compositions that will survive at the highest yield possible through the varying pH environments of the distinct regions of the Gl tract. Understanding how the bacterial compositions react to the pH of the Gl tract also assists in formulation, so that the number of bacteria in a dosage form can be increased if beneficial and/or so that the composition may be administered in an enteric-coated capsule or tablet or with a buffering or protective composition. As the pH of the stomach can drop to a pH of 1 to 2 after a high-protein meal for a short time before physiological mechanisms adjust it to a pH of 3 to 4 and often resides at a resting pH of 4 to 5, and as the pH of the small intestine can range from a pH of 6 to 7.4, bacterial compositions can be prepared that survive these varying pH ranges (specifically wherein at least 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or as much as 100% of the bacteria can survive gut transit times through various pH ranges). This can be tested by exposing the bacterial composition to varying pH ranges for the expected gut transit times through those pH ranges. Therefore, as a nonlimiting example only, 18-hour cultures of bacterial compositions can be grown in standard media, such as gut microbiota medium (“GMM”, see Goodman et al., Extensive personal human gut microbiota culture collections characterized and manipulated in gnotobiotic mice, PNAS 108(15):6252-6257 (2011)) or another animal-products-free medium, with the addition of pH adjusting agents for a pH of 1 to 2 for 30 minutes, a pH of 3 to 4 for 1 hour, a pH of 4 to 5 for 1 to 2 hours, and a pH of 6 to 7.4 for 2.5 to 3 hours. An alternative method fortesting stability to acid is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,839,281. Survival of bacteria may be determined by culturing the bacteria and counting colonies on appropriate selective or non-selective media. Bile Acid Sensitivity Testing [0233] Additionally, in some embodiments, testing for bile-acid resistance enhances the selection of bacterial compositions that will survive exposures to bile acid during transit through the Gl tract. Bile acids are secreted into the small intestine and can, like pH, affect the survival of bacterial compositions. This can be tested by exposing the bacterial compositions to bile acids for the expected gut exposure time to bile acids. For example, bile acid solutions can be prepared at desired concentrations using 0.05 η∩Μ Tris at pH 9 as the solvent. After the bile acid is dissolved, the pH of the solution may be adjusted to 7.2 with 10% HCI. Bacterial compositions can be cultured in 2.2 ml of a bile acid composition mimicking the concentration and type of bile acids in the patient, 1.0 ml of 10% sterile-filtered feces media and 0.1 ml of an 18-hour culture of the given strain of bacteria. Incubations may be conducted for from 2.5 to 3 hours or longer. An alternative method for testing stability to bile acid is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,839,281. Survival of bacteria may be determined by culturing the bacteria and counting colonies on appropriate selective or non-selective media. Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing [0234] As a further optional sensitivity test, bacterial compositions can be tested for sensitivity to antibiotics. In one embodiment, bacterial compositions can be chosen so that the bacterial constituents are sensitive to antibiotics such that if necessary they can be eliminated or substantially reduced from the patient’s gastrointestinal tract by at least one antibiotic targeting the bacterial composition. Adherence to Gastrointestinal Cells [0235] The bacterial compositions may optionally be tested for the ability to adhere to gastrointestinal cells. A method for testing adherence to gastrointestinal cells is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,839,281. Methods for Purifying Spores Solvent Treatments [0236] To purify the bacterial spores, the fecal material is subjected to one or more solvent treatments. A solvent treatment is a miscible solvent treatment (either partially miscible or fully miscible) or an immiscible solvent treatment. Miscibility is the ability of two liquids to mix with each to form a homogeneous solution. Water and ethanol, for example, are fully miscible such that a mixture containing water and ethanol in any ratio will show only one phase. Miscibility is provided as a wt/wt%, or weight of one solvent in 100 g of final solution. If two solvents are fully miscible in all proportions, their miscibility is 100%. Provided as fully miscible solutions with water are alcohols, e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, etc. The alcohols can be provided already combined with water; e.g., a solution containing10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 89%, 85%, 90%, 95% or greater than 95% Other solvents are only partially miscible, meaning that only some portion will dissolve in water. Diethyl ether, for example, is partially miscible with water. Up to 7 grams of diethyl ether will dissolve in 93 g of water to give a 7% (wt/wt%) solution. If more diethyl ether is added, a two phase solution will result with a distinct diethyl ether layer above the water. Other miscible materials include ethers, dimethoxyethane, ortetrahydrofuran In contrast, an oil such as an alkane and water are immiscible and form two phases. Further, immiscible treatments are optionally combined with a detergent, either an ionic detergent or a non-ionic detergent. Exemplary detergents include Triton Χ-100, Tween 20, Tween 80, Nonidet Ρ40, a pluronic, or a polyol. Chromatography treatments [0237] To purify spore populations, the fecal materials are subjected to one or more chromatographic treatments, either sequentially or in parallel. In a chromatographic treatment, a solution containing the fecal material is contacted with a solid medium containing a hydrophobic interaction chromatographic (HIC) medium or an affinity chromatographic medium. In an alternative embodiment, a solid medium capable of absorbing a residual habitat product present in the fecal material is contacted with a solid medium that adsorbs a residual habitat product. In certain embodiments, the HIC medium contains sepharose or a derivatized sepharose such as butyl sepharose, octyl sepharose, phenyl sepharose, or butyl-s sepharose. In other embodiments, the affinity chromatographic medium contains material derivatized with mucin type I, II, III, IV, V, or VI, or oligosaccharides derived from or similar to those of mucins type I, II, III, IV, V, or VI. Alternatively, the affinity chromatographic medium contains material derivatized with antibodies that recognize spore-forming bacteria. Mechanical Treatments [0238] Provided herein is the physical disruption of the fecal material, particularly by one or more mechanical treatment such as blending, mixing, shaking, vortexing, impact pulverization, and sonication. As provided herein, the mechanical disrupting treatment substantially disrupts a non-spore material present in the fecal material and does not substantially disrupt a spore present in the fecal material. Mechanical treatments optionally include filtration treatments, where the desired spore populations are retained on a filter while the undesirable (non-spore) fecal components to pass through, and the spore fraction is then recovered from the filter medium. Alternatively, undesirable particulates and eukaryotic cells may be retained on a filter while bacterial cells including spores pass through. In some embodiments the spore fraction retained on the filter medium is subjected to a diafiltration step, wherein the retained spores are contacted with a wash liquid, typically a sterile saline-containing solution or other diluent, in order to further reduce or remove the undesirable fecal components. Thermal Treatments [0239] Provided herein is the thermal disruption of the fecal material. Generally, the fecal material is mixed in a saline-containing solution such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subjected to a heated environment, such as a warm room, incubator, water-bath, or the like, such that efficient heat transfer occurs between the heated environment and the fecal material. Preferably the fecal material solution is mixed during the incubation to enhance thermal conductivity and disrupt particulate aggregates. Thermal treatments can be modulated by the temperature of the environment and/or the duration of the thermal treatment. For example, the fecal material or a liquid comprising the fecal material is subjected to a heated environment, e.g., a hot water bath of at least about 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100 or greater than 100 degrees Celsius, for at least about 1,5,10,15, 20, 30, 45 seconds, or 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, or 50 minutes, or 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more than 10 hours. In certain embodiments the thermal treatment occurs at two different temperatures, such as 30 seconds in a 100 degree Celsius environment followed by 10 minutes in a 50 degree Celsius environment. In preferred embodiments the temperature and duration of the thermal treatment are sufficient to kill or remove pathogenic materials while not substantially damaging or reducing the germination-competency of the spores. Irradiation Treatments [0240] Provided are methods of treating the fecal material or separated contents of the fecal material with ionizing radiation, typically gamma irradiation, ultraviolet irradiation or electron beam irradiation provided at an energy level sufficient to kill pathogenic materials while not substantially damaging the desired spore populations. For example, ultraviolet radiation at 254ηη∩ provided at an energy level below about 22,000 microwatt seconds per cm2 will not generally destroy desired spores. Centrifugation and Density Separation Treatments [0241] Provided are methods of separating desired spore populations from the other components of the fecal material by centrifugation. A solution containing the fecal material is subjected to one or more centrifugation treatments, e.g., at about 1000 χ g, 2000 χ g, 3000 χ g, 4000 χ g, 5000 χ g, 6000 χ g, 7000 χ g, 8000 χ g or greater than 8000 χ g. Differential centrifugation separates desired spores from undesired non-spore material; at low forces the spores are retained in solution, while at higher forces the spores are pelleted while smaller impurities (e.g., virus particles, phage) are retained in solution. For example, a first low force centrifugation pellets fibrous materials; a second, higher force centrifugation pellets undesired eukaryotic cells, and a third, still higher force centrifugation pellets the desired spores while small contaminants remain in suspension. In some embodiments density or mobility gradients or cushions (e.g., step cushions), such as Percoll, Ficoll, Nycodenz, Flistodenz or sucrose gradients, are used to separate desired spore populations from other materials in the fecal material. [0242] Also provided herein are methods of producing spore populations that combine two or more of the treatments described herein in order to synergistically purify the desired spores while killing or removing undesired materials and/or activities from the spore population. It is generally desirable to retain the spore populations under non-germinating and non-growth promoting conditions and media, in order to minimize the growth of pathogenic bacteria present in the spore populations and to minimize the germination of spores into vegetative bacterial cells. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND FORMULATIONS OF THE INVENTION Formulations [0243] Provided are formulations for administration to humans and other subjects in need thereof.

A carbohydrate can be a monosaccharide, a disaccharide, trisaccharide, oligosaccharide, or polysaccharide. The most basic carbohydrate is a monosaccharide, such as glucose, sucrose, galactose, mannose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, and fructose. Disaccharides are two joined monosaccharides.

[0265] In one embodiment, the formulations are filled into gelatin capsules for oral administration. An example of an appropriate capsule is a 250 mg gelatin capsule containing from 10 (up to 100 mg) of lyophilized powder (108 to 1011 bacteria), 160 mg microcrystalline cellulose, 77.5 mg gelatin, and 2.5 mg magnesium stearate. In an alternative embodiment, from 105 to 1012 bacteria may be used, 105 to 107, 106 to 107, or 108 to 101°, with attendant adjustments of the excipients if necessary. In an alternative embodiment, an enteric-coated capsule or tablet or with a buffering or protective composition can be used. EXAMPLES [0266] Below are examples of specific embodiments for carrying out the present invention. The examples are offered for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers used (e.g., amounts, temperatures, etc.), but some experimental error and deviation should, of course, be allowed for. [0267] The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of protein chemistry, biochemistry, recombinant DNA techniques and pharmacology, within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. See, e.g., Τ.Ε. Creighton, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties (W.H. Freeman and Company, 1993); A.L. Lehninger, Biochemistry (Worth Publishers, Inc., current addition); Sambrook, et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2nd Edition, 1989); Methods In Enzymology (S. Colowick and Ν. Kaplan eds., Academic Press, Inc.); Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition (Easton, Pennsylvania: Mack Publishing Company, 1990); Carey and Sundberg Advanced Organic Chemistry 3rd Ed. (Plenum Press) Vols A and Β(1992). Example 1. Provision of fecal material. [0268] Fresh fecal samples were obtained from healthy human donors who have been screened for general good health and for the absence of infectious diseases, and meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, inclusion criteria include being in good general health, without significant medical history, physical examination findings, or clinical laboratory abnormalities, regular bowel movements with stool appearance typically Type 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 on the Bristol Stool Scale, and having a BMI >18 kg/m2 and ≤ 25 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria generally included significant chronic or acute medical conditions including renal, hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, genitourinary, endocrine, immunologic, metabolic, neurologic or hematological disease, a family history of, inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, Irritable bowel syndrome, colon, stomach or other gastrointestinal malignancies, or gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes, or recent use of yogurt or commercial probiotic materials in which an organism(s) is a primary component. Samples were collected directly using a commode specimen collection system, which contains a plastic support placed on the toilet seat and a collection container that rests on the support. Feces were deposited into the container, and the lid was then placed on the container and sealed tightly. The sample was then delivered on ice within 1-4 hours for processing. Samples were mixed with a sterile disposable tool, and 2-4 g aliquots were weighed and placed into tubes and flash frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Aliquots are frozen at -80 degrees Celsius until use. [0269] Optionally, the fecal material was suspended in a solution, and/or fibrous and/or particulate materials were removed. A frozen aliquot containing a known weight of feces was removed from storage at -80 degrees Celsius and allowed to thaw at room temperature. Sterile 1χ PBS was added to create a 10% w/v suspension, and vigorous vortexing was performed to suspend the fecal material until the material appeared homogeneous. The material was then left to sit for 10 minutes at room temperature to sediment fibrous and particulate matter. The suspension above the sediment was then carefully removed into a new tube and contains a purified spore population. Optionally, the suspension was then centrifuged at a low speed, e.g., 1000 χ g, for 5 minutes to pellet particulate matter including fibers. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant, which contained vegetative organisms and spores, was removed into a new tube. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 6000 χ g for 10 minutes to pellet the vegetative organisms and spores. The pellet was then resuspended in 1χ PBS with vigorous vortexing until the material appears homogenous. Example 2. Spore purification from alcohol treatment of fecal material. [0270] A 10% w/v suspension of human fecal material in PBS was mixed with absolute ethanol in a 1:1 ratio and vortexed to mix for 1 minute. The suspension was incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 1 hour. After incubation the suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes to pellet spores. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of PBS. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 15% and then the purified spore fraction is stored at -80 degrees Celsius. Example 2Α. Generation of a spore preparation from alcohol treatment of fecal material. [0271] A 10% w/v suspension of human fecal material in PBS was mixed with absolute ethanol in a 1:1 ratio and vortexed to mix for 1 minute. The suspension was incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 1 hour. After incubation the suspension is centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes to concentrate spores into a pellet containing a purified sprore-containing preparation. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in an equal volume of PBS. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 15% and then the purified spore preparation was stored at -80 degrees Celsius. Example 3. Spore purification from thermal treatment of fecal material. [0272] A 10% w/v suspension of human fecal material in PBS was incubated in a water bath at 80 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 15% and then the enriched spore containing material was stored at -80 degrees Celsius. Example 4. Spore purification from alcohol treatment and thermal treatment of fecal material. [0273] A 10% w/v suspension of human feces in PBS was mixed with absolute ethanol in a 1:1 ratio and vortexed to mix for 1 minute. The suspension was incubated in a water bath under aerobic conditions at 37 degrees Celsius for 1 hour. After incubation the suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes to pellet spores. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in equal volume PBS. The ethanol treated spore population was then incubated in a water bath at 80 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 15% and the purified spore fraction was stored at -80 C. Example 5. Spore purification from detergent treatment of fecal material. [0274] A 10% w/v suspension of human feces in PBS is prepared to contain a final concentration of 0.5 to 2% Triton Χ-100. After shaking incubation for 30 minutes at 25 to 37 degrees Celsius, the sample is centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 - 10 minutes to pellet particulate matter and large cells. The bacterial spores are recovered in the supernatant fraction, where the purified spore population is optionally further treated, such as in Example 4. Without being bound by theory, detergent addition to the fecal mixture produces better spore populations, at least in part by enhancing separation of the spores from particulates thereby resulting in higher yields of spores. Example 6. Spore purification bv chromatographic separation of fecal material. [0275] A spore-enriched population such as obtained from Examples 1-5 above, is mixed with NaCI to a final concentration of 4Μ total salt and contacted with octyl Sepharose 4 Fast Flow to bind the hydrophobic spore fraction. The resin is washed with 4Μ NaCI to remove less hydrophobic components, and the spores are eluted with distilled water, and the desired enriched spore fraction is collected via UV absorbance. Example 7. Spore purification bv filtration of fecal material. [0276] A spore-enriched population such as obtained from Examples 1-6 above is diluted 1:10 with PBS, and placed in the reservoir vessel of a tangential flow microfiltration system. A 0.2 urn pore size mixed cellulose ester hydrophilic tangential flow filter is connected to the reservoir such as by a tubing loop. The diluted spore preparation is recirculated through the loop by pumping, and the pressure gradient across the walls of the microfilter forces the supernatant liquid through the filter pores. By appropriate selection of the filter pore size the desired bacterial spores are retained, while smaller contaminants such as cellular debris, and other contaminants in feces such as bacteriophage pass through the filter. Fresh PBS buffer is added to the reservoir periodically to enhance the washout of the contaminants. At the end of the diafiltration, the spores are concentrated approximately ten-fold to the original concentration. The purified spores are collected from the reservoir and stored as provided herein. Example 8. Characterization of purified spore populations. [0277] Counts of viable spores are determined by performing 10 fold serial dilutions in PBS and plating to Brucella Blood Agar Petri plates or applicable solid media. Plates are incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 2 days. Colonies are counted from a dilution plate with 50-400 colonies and used to back-calculate the number of viable spores in the population. The ability to germinate into vegetative bacteria is also demonstrated. Visual counts are determined by phase contrast microscopy. A spore preparation is either diluted in PBS or concentrated by centrifugation, and a 5 microliter aliquot is placed into a Petroff Hauser counting chamber for visualization at 400χ magnification. Spores are counted within ten 0.05 mm χ 0.05 mm grids and an average spore count per grid is determined and used to calculate a spore count per ml of preparation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reduction in purified spore populations is measured using a Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay such as the commercially available ToxinSensor™ Chromogenic LAL Endotoxin Assay Kit (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) or other standard methods known to those skilled in the art. Example 9. Determination of bacterial pathogens in purified spore populations. [0278] Bacterial pathogens present in a purified spore population are determined by qPCR using specific oligonucleotide primers as follows. [0279] Standard Curve Preparation. The standard curve is generated from wells containing the pathogen of interest at a known concentration or simultaneously quantified by selective spot plating. Serial dilutions of duplicate cultures are performed in sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Genomic DNA is then extracted from the standard curve samples along with the other samples. Genomic DNA Extraction. [0280] Genomic DNA may be extracted from 100 μΐ of fecal samples, fecalderived samples, or purified spore preparations using the Mo Bio Powersoil®-htp 96 Well Soil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with two exceptions: the beadbeating is performed for 2 χ 4:40 minutes using a BioSpec Mini-Beadbeater-96 (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) and the DNA is eluted in 50 μΐ of Solution C6. Alternatively the genomic DNA could be isolated using the Mo Bio Powersoil® DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA), the Sigma-Aldrich Extract-N-Amp™Plant PCR Kit, the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TaPCR Composition and Conditions. [0281] The qPCR reaction to detect C. difficile contains 1χ HotMasterMix (5PRIME, Gaithersburg, MD), 900 ηΜ of Wr-tcdB-F (AGCAGTTGΑΑΤATAGTGGTTTAGTTAGAGTTG, IDT, Coralville, IA), 900 ηΜ of Wr-tcdB-R (CATGCTTTTTTAGTTTCTGGATTGΑΑ, IDT, Coralville, IA), 250 ηΜ of We-tcdB-P (6 FAM-CAT CCAGT CT CAATT GT AT AT GTTT CT CCA-M G Β, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and PCR Water (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) to 18 μI (Primers adaped from: Wroblewski, D. et al. Rapid Molecular Characterization of Clostridium difficile and Assessment of Populations of C. difficile in Stool Specimens. Journal of Clinical Microbiology 47:2142-2148 (2009)). This reaction mixture is aliquoted to wells of a MicroAmp® Fast Optical 96-well Reaction Plate with Barcode (0.1 mL) (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). To this reaction mixture, 2 μΐ of extracted genomic DNA is added. The qPCR is performed on a BioRad C1000™ Thermal Cycler equipped with a CFX96™ Real-Time System (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The thermocycling conditions are 95°C for 2 minutes followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 3 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, and fluorescent readings of the FAM and ROX channels. Other bacterial pathogens can be detected by using primers and a probe specific for the pathogen of interest. Data Analysis. [0282] The Cq value for each well on the FAM channel is determined by the CFX Manager™ Software Version 2.1. The Iog10(cfu/ml) of each experimental sample is calculated by inputting a given sample’s Cq value into linear regression model generated from the standard curve comparing the Cq values of the standard curve wells to the known Iog10(cfu/ml) of those samples. [0283] [Viral pathogens present in a purified spore population are determined by qPCR as described herein and otherwise known in the art. Example 10: Species Identification [0284] The identity of the spore-forming species which grew up from a complex fraction can be determined in multiple ways. First, individual colonies can be picked into liquid media in a 96 well format, grown up and saved as 15% glycerol stocks at 80C. Aliquots of the cultures can be placed into cell lysis buffer and colony PCR methods can be used to amplify and sequence the 16S rDNA gene (Example 2). Alternatively, colonies may be streaked to purity in several passages on solid media. Well separated colonies are streaked onto the fresh plates of the same kind and incubated for 48-72 hours at 37C. The process is repeated multiple times in order to ensure purity. Pure cultures can be analyzed by phenotypic- or sequence-based methods, including 16S rDNA amplification and sequencing as described in Examples 11 & 12. Sequence characterization of pure isolates or mixed communities e.g. plate scrapes and spore fractions can also include whole genome shotgun sequencing. The latter is valuable to determine the presence of genes associated with sporulation, antibiotic resistance, pathogenicity, and virulence. Colonies can also be scraped from plates ℮η masse and sequenced using a massively parallel sequencing method as described in Examples 11 & 12 such that individual 16S signatures can be identified in a complex mixture. Optionally, the sample can be sequenced prior to germination (if appropriate DNA isolation procedures are used to Isye and release the DNA from spores) in order to compare the diversity of germinable species with the total number of species in a spore sample. As an alternative or complementary approach to 16S analysis, MALDI-TOFmass spec can also be used for species identification (as reviewed in Anaerobe 22:123). Example 11: 16s Sequencing to Determine Operational Taxonomic Unit IQJU1 Method for Determining 16S Sequence [0285] OTUs may be defined either by full 16S sequencing of the rRNA gene, by sequencing of a specific hypervariable region of this gene (i.e. V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, or V9), or by sequencing of any combination of hypervariable regions from this gene (e.g. V1-3 or V3-5). The bacterial 16S rDNA is approximately 1500 nucleotides in length and is used in reconstructing the evolutionary relationships and sequence similarity of one bacterial isolate to another using phylogenetic approaches. 16S sequences are used for phylogenetic reconstruction as they are in general highly conserved, but contain specific hypervariable regions that harbor sufficient nucleotide diversity to differentiate genera and species of most microbes. [0286] Using well known techniques, in order to determine the full 16S sequence or the sequence of any hypervariable region of the 16S sequence, genomic DNA is extracted from a bacterial sample, the 16S rDNA (full region or specific hypervariable regions) amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the PCR products cleaned, and nucleotide sequences delineated to determine the genetic composition of 16S gene or subdomain of the gene. If full 16S sequencing is performed, the sequencing method used may be, but is not limited to, Sanger sequencing. If one or more hypervariable regions are used, such as the V4 region, the sequencing may be, but is not limited to being, performed using the Sanger method or using a nextgeneration sequencing method, such as an lllumina (sequencing by synthesis) method using barcoded primers allowing for multiplex reactions. [0287] In addition to the 16S rRNA gene, one may define an OTU by sequencing a selected set of genes that are known to be marker genes for a given species or taxonomic group of OTUs. These genes may alternatively be assayed using a PCRbased screening strategy. As example, various strains of pathogenic Escherichia coli can be distinguished using DNAs from the genes that encode heat-labile (LTI, LTIIa, and LTIIb) and heat-stable (STI and STII) toxins, verotoxin types 1, 2, and 2℮ (VT1, VT2, and VT2e, respectively), cytotoxic necrotizing factors (CNF1 and CNF2), attaching and effacing mechanisms (eaeA), enteroaggregative mechanisms (Eagg), and enteroinvasive mechanisms (Einv). The optimal genes to utilize for taxonomic assignment of OTUs by use of marker genes will be familiar to one with ordinary skill of the art of sequence based taxonomic identification. Genomic DNA Extraction [0288] Genomic DNA is extracted from pure microbial cultures using a hot alkaline lysis method. 1 μΐ of microbial culture is added to 9 μΐ of Lysis Buffer (25η∩Μ NaOFI, 0.2 η∩Μ EDTA) and the mixture is incubated at 95°C for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the samples are cooled to 4°C and neutralized by the addition of 10 μI of Neutralization Buffer (40 η∩Μ Τris-HCI) and then diluted 10-fold in Elution Buffer (10 η∩Μ Τris-HCI). Alternatively, genomic DNA is extracted from pure microbial cultures using commercially available kits such as the Mo Bio Ultraclean® Microbial DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) or by standard methods known to those skilled in the art. Amplification of 16S Sequences for downstream Sanger Sequencing [0289] To amplify bacterial 16S rDNA (Figure 1Α), 2 μΐ of extracted gDNA is added to a 20 μΐ final volume PCR reaction. For full-length 16 sequencing the PCR reaction also contains 1χ FlotMasterMix (5PRIME, Gaithersburg, MD), 250 ∩Μ of 27f (AGRGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG, IDT, Coralville, 1Α), and 250 ∩Μ of 1492r (ΤACGGYTACCTTGTTAYGACTT, IDT, Coralville, IA), with PCR Water (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) for the balance of the volume. Alternatively, other universal bacterial primers or thermostable polymerases known to those skilled in the art are used. For example primers are available to those skilled in the art for the sequencing of the the “V1-V9 regions” of the 16S rRNA (Figure 1Α). These regions refer to the first through ninth hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene that are used for genetic typing of bacterial samples. These regions in bacteria are defined by nucleotides 69-99, 137-242, 433-497, 576-682, 822-879, 986-1043, 1117-1173, 1243-1294 and 1435-1465 respectively using numbering based on the Ε. coli system of nomenclature. Brosius et al., Complete nucleotide sequence of a 16S ribosomal RNA gene from Escherichia coli, PNAS 75(10):4801-4805 (1978). In some embodiments, at least one of the V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, and V9 regions are used to characterize an OTU. In one embodiment, the V1, V2, and V3 regions are used to characterize an OTU. In another embodiment, the V3, V4, and V5 regions are used to characterize an OTU. In another embodiment, the V4 region is used to characterize an OTU. A person of ordinary skill in the art can identify the specific hypervariable regions of a candidate 16S rRNA (in Figure 1Α) by comparing the candidate sequence in question to the reference sequence (Figure 1Β) and identifying the hypervariable regions based on similarity to the reference hypervariable regions. [0290] The PCR is performed on commercially available thermocyclers such as a BioRad MyCycler™ Thermal Cycler (BioRad, Flercules, CA). The reactions are run at 94°C for 2 minutes followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 51 °C for 30 seconds, and 68°C for 1 minute 30 seconds, followed by a 7 minute extension at 72°C and an indefinite hold at4°C. Following PCR, gel electrophoresis of a portion of the reaction products is used to confirm successful amplification of a ~1.5 kb product. [0291] To remove nucleotides and oligonucleotides from the PCR products, 2 μΐ of FIT ExoSap-IT (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) is added to 5 μΐ of PCR product followed by a 15 minute incubation at 37°C and then a 15 minute inactivation at 80°C. Amplification of 16S Sequences for downstream characterization bv massively parallel sequencing technologies [0292] Amplification performed for downstream sequencing by short read technologies such as lllumina require amplification using primers known to those skilled in the art that additionally include a sequence-based barcoded tag. As example, to amplify the 16s hypervariable region V4 region of bacterial 16S rDNA, 2 μΐ of extracted gDNA is added to a 20 μΐ final volume PCR reaction. The PCR reaction also contains 1χ HotMasterMix (5PRIME, Gaithersburg, MD), 200 ηΜ of V4_515f_adapt (AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTATGGTAATTGTGTGCCAGCMGCC GCGGTAA, IDT, Coralville, IA), and 200 ηΜ of barcoded 806rbc (CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT_12bpGolayBarcode_AGTCAGTCAGCCGG ACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT, IDT, Coralville, IA), with PCR Water (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) for the balance of the volume. These primers incorporate barcoded adapters for lllumina sequencing by synthesis. Optionally, identical replicate, triplicate, or quadruplicate reactions may be performed. Alternatively other universal bacterial primers or thermostable polymerases known to those skilled in the art are used to obtain different amplification and sequencing error rates as well as results on alternative sequencing technologies. [0293] The PCR amplification is performed on commercially available thermocyclers such as a BioRad MyCycler™ Thermal Cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The reactions are run at 94°C for 3 minutes followed by 25 cycles of 94°C for 45 seconds, 50°C for 1 minute, and 72°C for 1 minute 30 seconds, followed by a 10 minute extension at 72°C and a indefinite hold at 4°C. Following PCR, gel electrophoresis of a portion of the reaction products is used to confirm successful amplification of a ~1.5 kb product. PCR cleanup is performed as specified in the previous example. Sanger Sequencing of Target Amplicons from Pure Homogeneous Samples [0294] To detect nucleic acids for each sample, two sequencing reactions are performed to generate a forward and reverse sequencing read. For full-length 16s sequencing primers 27f and 1492r are used.. 40 ng of ExoSap-IT-cleaned PCR products are mixed with 25 pmol of sequencing primer and Mo Bio Molecular Biology Grade Water (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) to 15 μI total volume. This reaction is submitted to a commercial sequencing organization such as Genewiz (South Plainfield, NJ) for Sanger sequencing. Massively Parallel Sequencing of Target Amplicons from Heterogeneous Samples [0295] DNA Quantification & Library Construction. The cleaned PCR amplification products are quantified using the Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following quantification, the barcoded cleaned PCR products are combined such that each distinct PCR product is at an equimolar ratio to create a prepared lllumina library. [0296] Nucleic Acid Detection. The prepared library is sequenced on lllumina HiSeq or MiSeq sequencers (lllumina, San Diego, CA) with cluster generation, template hybridization, iso-thermal amplification, linearization, blocking and denaturization and hybridization of the sequencing primers performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 16SV4SeqFw (TATGGTAATT GTGT GCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA), 16SV4SeqRev (AGTCAGTCAGCCGGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT), and 16SV4lndex (ATTAGAWACCCBDGTAGTCCGGCTGACTGACT) (IDT, Coralville, IA) are used for sequencing. Other sequencing technologies can be used such as but not limited to 454, Pacific Biosciences, Helicos, Ion Torrent, and Nanopore using protocols that are standard to someone skilled in the art of genomic sequencing. Example 12: Sequence Read Annotation [0297] Primary Read Annotation [0298] Nucleic acid sequences are analyzed and annotations are to define taxonomic assignments using sequence similarity and phylogenetic placement methods or a combination of the two strategies. A similar approach can be used to annotate protein names, transcription factor names, and any other classification schema for nucleic acid sequences. Sequence similarity based methods include those familiar to individuals skilled in the art including, but not limited to BLAST, BLASTx, tBLASTn, tBLASTx, RDP-classifier, DNAclust, and various implementations of these algorithms such as Qiime or Mothur. These methods rely on mapping a sequence read to a reference database and selecting the match with the best score and e-value. Common databases include, but are not limited to the Human Microbiome Project, NCBI non-redundant database, Greengenes, RDP, and Silva. Phylogenetic methods can be used in combination with sequence similarity methods to improve the calling accuracy of an annotation or taxonomic assignment. Here tree topologies and nodal structure are used to refine the resolution of the analysis. In this approach we analyze nucleic acid sequences using one of numerous sequence similarity approaches and leverage phylogenetic methods that are well known to those skilled in the art, including but not limited to maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction (see e.g. Liu Κ, Linder CR, and WarnowT. 2011. RAxML and FastTree: Comparing Two Methods for Large-Scale Maximum Likelihood Phylogeny Estimation. PLoS ONE 6: ℮27731. McGuire G, Denham MC, and Balding DJ. 2001. Models of sequence evolution for DNA sequences containing gaps. Mol. Biol. Evol 18: 481-490. Wrobel Β. 2008. Statistical measures of uncertainty for branches in phylogenetic trees inferred from molecular sequences by using model-based methods. J. Appl. Genet. 49: 49-67.) Sequence reads are placed into a reference phylogeny comprised of appropriate reference sequences. Annotations are made based on the placement of the read in the phylogenetic tree. The certainty or significance of the OTU annotation is defined based on the OTU’s sequence similarity to a reference nucleic acid sequence and the proximity of the OTU sequence relative to one or more reference sequences in the phylogeny. As an example, the specificity of a taxonomic assignment is defined with confidence at the the level of Family, Genus, Species, or Strain with the confidence determined based on the position of bootstrap supported branches in the reference phylogenetic tree relative to the placement of the OTU sequence being interrogated. [0299] Clade Assignments [0300] The ability of 16S-V4 OTU identification to assign an OTU as a specific species depends in part on the resolving power of the 16S-V4 region of the 16S gene for a particular species or group of species. Both the density of available reference 16S sequences for different regions of the tree as well as the inherent variability in the 16S gene between different species will determine the definitiveness of a taxonomic annotation. Given the topological nature of a phylogenetic tree and the fact that tree represents hierarchical relationships of OTUs to one another based on their sequence similarity and an underlying evolutionary model, taxonomic annotations of a read can be rolled up to a higher level using a clade-based assignment procedure (Table 1). Using this approach, clades are defined based on the topology of a phylogenetic tree that is constructed from full-length 16S sequences using maximum likelihood or other phylogenetic models familiar to individuals with ordinary skill in the art of phylogenetics. Clades are constructed to ensure that all OTUs in a given clade are: (i) within a specified number of bootstrap supported nodes from one another (generally, 1-5 bootstraps), and (ii) within a 5% genetic similarity. OTUs that are within the same clade can be distinguished as genetically and phylogenetically distinct from OTUs in a different clade based on 16S-V4 sequence data. OTUs falling within the same clade are evolutionarily closely related and may or may not be distinguishable from one another using 16S-V4 sequence data. The power of clade based analysis is that members of the same clade, due to their evolutionary relatedness, are likely to play similar functional roles in a microbial ecology such as that found in the human gut. Compositions substituting one species with another from the same clade are likely to have conserved ecological function and therefore are useful in the present invention. [0301] Notably, 16S sequences of isolates of a given OTU are phylogenetically placed within their respective clades, sometimes in conflict with the microbiologicalbased assignment of species and genus that may have preceded 16S-based assignment. Discrepancies between taxonomic assignment based on microbiological characteristics versus genetic sequencing are known to exist from the literature. Example 13: Germinating Spores [0302] Germinating a spore fraction increases the number of viable spores that will grow on various media types. To germinate a population of spores, the sample is moved to the anaerobic chamber, resuspended in prereduced PBS, mixed and incubated for 1 hour at 37C to allow for germination. Germinants can include aminoacids (e.g., alanine, glycine), sugars (e.g., fructose), nucleosides (e.g., inosine), bile salts (e.g., cholate and taurocholate), metal cations (e.g., Mg2+, Ca2+), fatty acids, and long-chain alkyl amines (e.g., dodecylamine, Germination of bacterial spores with alkyl primary amines” J. Bacteriology, 1961.). Mixtures of these or more complex natural mixtures, such as rumen fluid or Oxgall, can be used to induce germination. Oxgall is dehydrated bovine bile composed of fatty acids, bile acids, inorganic salts, sulfates, bile pigments, cholesterol, mucin, lecithin, glycuronic acids, porphyrins, and urea. The germination can also be performed in a growth medium like prereduced BHIS/oxgall germination medium, in which BHIS (Brain heart infusion powder (37 g/L), yeast extract (5 g/L), L-cysteine HCI (1 g/L)) provides peptides, amino acids, inorganic ions and sugars in the complex BHI and yeast extract mixtures and Oxgall provides additional bile acid germinants. [0303] In addition, pressure may be used to germinate spores. The selection of germinants can vary with the microbe being sought. Different species require different germinants and different isolates of the same species can require different germinants for optimal germination. Finally, it is important to dilute the mixture prior to plating because some germinants are inhibitory to growth of the vegetative-state microorganisms. For instance, it has been shown that alkyl amines must be neutralized with anionic lipophiles in order to promote optimal growth. Bile acids can also inhibit growth of some organisms despite promoting their germination, and must be diluted away prior to plating for viable cells. [0304] For example, BHIS/oxgall solution is used as a germinant and contains 0.5Χ BHIS medium with 0.25% oxgall (dehydrated bovine bile) where 1χ BHIS medium contains the following per L of solution: 6g Brain Heart Infusion from solids, 7g peptic digest of animal tissue, 14.5g of pancreatic digest of casein, 5g of yeast extract, 5g sodium chloride, 2g glucose, 2.5g disodium phosphate, and 1g cysteine.

Finally, the solution is filter sterilized and used as a germinant solution. Example 14: Selection of Media for Growth [0306] It is important to select appropriate media to support growth, including preferred carbon sources. For example, some organisms prefer complex sugars such as cellobiose over simple sugars. Examples of media used in the isolation of sporulating organisms include ΕΥΑ, BHI, BHIS, and GAM (see below for complete names and references). Multiple dilutions are plated out to ensure that some plates will have well isolated colonies on them for analysis, or alternatively plates with dense colonies may scraped and suspended in PBS to generate a mixed diverse community. [0307] Plates are incubated anaerobically or aerobically at 37 C for 48-72 or more hours, targeting anaerobic or aerobic spore formers, respectively.

The final alcohol concentration can range from 30-90%, preferably 50-70%. High speed centrifugation (3200 ref for 10min) is performed to remove solvent and the pellet is retained and washed. Subsequently, once the washed pellet is resuspended, a low speed centrifugation step (200 ref for 4 min) is performed to remove large particulate vegetative matter and the supernatant containing the spores is retained. High speed centrifugation (3200 ref for 10 min) is performed on the supernatant to concentrate the spore material. The pellet is then washed and resuspended to generate a 20% slurry. This is the ethanol treated spore preparation. The concentrated slurry is then separated with a density based gradient e.g. a CsCI gradient, sucrose gradient or combination of the two generating a ethanol treated, gradient-purified spore preparation. For example, a CsCI gradient is performed by loading a 20% volume of spore suspension on top a 80% volume of a stepwise CsCI gradient (w/v) containing the steps of 64%, 50%, 40% CsCI (w/v) and centrifuging for 20 min at 3200 ref. The spore fraction is then run on a sucrose step gradient with steps of 67%, 50%, 40%, and 30% (w/v). When centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor for 10 min at 3200 ref. The spores run roughly in the 30% and 40% sucrose fractions. The lower spore fraction (Figure 2) is then removed and washed to produce a concentrated ethanol treated, gradient-purified spore preparation. Taking advantage of the refractive properties of spores observed by phase contrast microscopy (spores are bright and refractive while germinated spores and vegetative cells are dark) one can see an enrichment of the spore fraction from a fecal bacterial cell suspension (Figure 3, left) compared to an ethanol treated, CsCI gradient purified, spore preparation (Figure 3, center), and to an ethanol treated, CsCI gradient purified, sucrose gradient purified, spore preparation (Figure 3, right). [0310] Furthermore, growth of spores after treatment with a germ inant can also be used to quantify a viable spore population. Briefly, samples were incubated with a germinant (Oxgall, 0.25% for up to 1 hour), diluted and plated anaerobically on ΒΒΑ (Brucella Blood Agar) or similar media (e.g. see Examples 4 and 5). Individual colonies were picked and DNA isolated for full-length 16S sequencing to identify the species composition (e.g. see examples 2 and 3). Analysis revealed that 22 species were observed in total (Table 2) with a vast majority present in both the material purified with the gradient and without the gradient, indicating no or inconsequential shift in the ecology as a result of gradient purification. Spore yield calculations demonstrate an efficient recovery of 38% of the spores from the initial fecal material as measured by germination and plating of spores on ΒΒΑ or measuring DPA count in the sample. Example 16: Bacterial compositions prevent C. difficile infection in a mouse model [0311] To test the therapeutic potential of the bacterial compositions a prophylactic mouse model of C. difficile infection (model based on Chen, et al., A mouse model of Clostridium difficile associated disease, Gastroenterology 135(6):1984-1992) was used. Two cages of five mice each were tested for each arm of the experiment. All mice received an antibiotic cocktail consisting of 10% glucose, kanamycin (0.5 mg/ml), gentamicin (0.044 mg/ml), colistin (1062.5 U/ml), metronidazole (0.269 mg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.156 mg/ml), ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) and Vancomycin (0.056 mg/ml) in their drinking water on days -14 through -5 and a dose of 10mg/kg Clindamycin by oral gavage on day -3. On day -1, they received either the test article or vehicle control via oral gavage. On day 0 they were challenged by administration of approximately 4.5 Iog10 cfu of C. difficile (ATCC 43255) via oral gavage. Optionally a positive control group received vancomycin from day -1 through day 3 in addition to the antibiotic protocol and C. difficile challenge specified above. Feces were collected from the cages for analysis of bacterial carriage, mortality was assessed every day from day 0 to day 6 and the weight and subsequent weight change of the animal was assessed with weight loss being associated with C. difficile infection. Mortality and reduced weight loss of the test article compared to the vehicle were used to assess the success of the test article. Additionally, a C. difficile symptom scoring was performed each day from day -1 through day 6. Clinical Score was based on a 0-4 scale by combining scores for Appearance (0-2 pts based on normal, hunched, piloerection, or lethargic), and Clinical Signs (0-2 points based on normal, wet tail, cold-to-the-touch, or isolation from other animals). [0312] In a naive control arm, animals were challenged with C. difficile. In the vancomycin positive control arm animals were dosed with C. difficile and treated with vancomycin from day -1 through day 3. The negative control was gavaged with PBS alone and no bacteria. The test arms of the experiment tested 1χ, 0.1χ, 0.01χ dilutions derived from a single donor preparation of ethanol treated spores (e.g. see example 6) or the heat treated feces prepared by treating a 20% slurry for 30min at 80C. Dosing for CFU counts was determined from the final ethanol treated spores and dilutions of total spores were administered at 1χ, 0.1 χ, 0.01 χ of the spore mixture for the ethanol treated fraction and a 1χ dose for the heat treated fraction. [0313] Weight loss and mortality were assessed on day 3. The negative control, treated with C. difficile only, exhibits 20% mortality and weight loss on Day 3, while the positive control of 10% human fecal suspension displays no mortality or weight loss on Day 3 (Table 3). EtOFI-treated feces prevents mortality and weight loss at three dilutions, while the heat-treated fraction was protective at the only dose tested. These data indicate that the spore fraction is efficacious in preventing C. difficile infection in the mouse. Example 17: The prophylactic and relapse prevention hamster models [0314] Previous studies with hamsters using toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of C. difficile demonstrated the utility of the hamster model in examining relapse post antibiotic treatment and the effects of prophylaxis treatments with cecal flora in C. difficile infection (Wilson et al. 1981, Wilson et al. 1983, Borriello et al. 1985) and more broadly gastrointestinal infectious disease. To demonstrate prophylactic use of a test article to ameliorate C. difficile infection, the following hamster model is used. In a prophylactic model, Clindamycin (10mg/kg s.c.) is given on day -5, the test article or control is administered on day -3, and C. difficile challenge occurs on day 0. In the positive control arm, vancomycin is then administered on day 1-5 (and vehicle control is delivered on day -3). Feces are collected on day -5, -4, -1, 1,3, 5, 7, 9 and fecal samples are assessed for pathogen carriage and reduction by microbiological methods, 16S sequencing approaches or other methods utilized by one skilled in the art. Mortality is assessed throughout the experiment through 21 days post C. difficile challenge. The percentage survival curves show that ethanol treated spores and ethanol treated, gradient-purified spores better protect the hamsters compared to the Vancomycin control, and vehicle control. [0315] See Figure 4: Prophylaxis model with the ethanol treated spore preparation and the ethanol treated, gradient-purified spore preparation. [0316] In the relapse prevention model, hamsters are challenged with toxigenic C. difficile strains on day 0, and treated with clindamycin by oral gavage on day 1, and vancomycin dosing day 2-6. Test or control treatment was then administered on day 7, 8, and 9. The groups of hamsters for each arm consist of 8 hamsters per group. Fecal material is collected on day -1, 1,3, 5, 7, 10 and 13 and hamster mortality is assessed throughout. Survival curves are used to assess the success of the test article e.g. ethanol treated or ethanol treated, gradient purified spores versus the control treatment in preventing hamster death. The survival curves demonstrate maximum efficacy for the ethanol treated, gradient-purified spores followed by the ethanol treated spores. Both treatments improved survival percentage over vancomycin treatment alone. [0317] See Figure 5: Relapse prevention model with ethanol treated spores and ethanol treated, gradient purified spores Example 18: Clinical treatment of recurrent C. difficile in patients [0318] To assess the efficacy of a test article (e.g., ethanol treated spore preparations, see Example 15) to treat recurrent C. difficile in human patients, the following procedure was performed to take feces from a healthy donor, inactivate via the ethanol treated spore preparation protocol described below, and treat recurrent C. difficile in patients presenting with this indication. Non-related donors were screened for general health history for absence of chronic medical conditions (including inflammatory bowel disease; irritable bowel syndrome; Celiac disease; or any history of gastrointestinal malignancy or polyposis), absence of risk factors for transmissible infections, antibiotic non-use in the previous 6 months, and negative results in laboratory assays for blood-borne pathogens (HIV, HTLV, HCV, HBV, CMV, HAV and Treponema pallidum) and fecal bacterial pathogens (Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Ε. coli 0157), ova and parasites, and other infectious agents (Giardia, Cryptosporidium Cyclospora, Isospora) prior to stool donation. [0319] Donor stool was frozen shortly after donation and sampled for testing. At the time of use, approximately 75 g of donor stool was thawed and resuspended in 500 ml. of non-bacteriostatic normal saline and mixed in a single use glass or plastic blender. The resulting slurry was sequentially passed through sterile, disposable mesh screens that remove particles of size 600, 300 and 200 microns. The slurry was then centrifuged briefly (200 ref for 4 min) to separate fibrous and particulate materials, and the supernatant (containing bacterial cells and spores) was transferred to a fresh container. Ethanol was added to a final concentration of 50% and the resulting -1500 ml slurry was incubated at room temperature for 1 hr with continuous mixing to inactivate vegetative bacterial cells. Midway through inactivation the slurry was transferred to a new bottle to ensure complete contact with the ethanol. The solid matter was pelleted in a centrifuge and washed 3 times with normal saline to remove residual ethanol. The final pellet was resuspended in 100% sterile, USP glycerol at a minimum volume, and filled into approximately 30 size 0 delayed release capsules (hypromellose DRcaps, Capsugel, Inc.) at 0.65 ml. suspension each. The capsules were immediately capped and placed onto an aluminum freezing block held at -80° C via dry ice to freeze. The frozen capsules were in turn over-capsulated with size 00 DRcaps to enhance capsule stability, labeled, and placed into < -65° C storage immediately. The final product was stored at < -65° C until the day and time of use. Encapsulated product may be stored for indefinitely at < -65° C. On the day of dosing capsules were warmed on wet ice for 1 to 2 hours to improve tolerability, and were then dosed with water ad libitium. [0320] Patient 1 is a 45-year old woman with a history of C. difficile infection and diarrhea for at least 1 year prior to treatment. She has been previously treated with multiple courses of antibiotics followed each time by recurrence of C. difficile-associated diarrhea. [0321] Patient 2 is an 81-year old female who has experienced recurrent C. difficile infection for 6 months prior to treatment despite adequate antibiotic therapy following each recurrence. [0322] 24 hours prior to starting oral treatment, CDAD antibiotic therapy was discontinued. Each patient received a colon preparation procedure intended to reduce the competing microbial burden in the gastrointestinal tract and to facilitate repopulation by the spore forming organisms in the investigational product. [0323] On the morning of the first treatment day, the patients received a dose of delayed release capsules containing the investigational product with water ad libitum. Patients were requested to avoid food for 1 hour thereafter. The next day, the patient returned to the clinic to receive an additional dose. Patients were asked to avoid food for 4 hours prior to receiving their second dose and for 1 hour following dosing. [0324] Both patients were followed closely for evidence of relapse or adverse symptoms following treatment. Patients were contacted by phone on Day 2, Day 4, and Weeks 1,2 and 4 and each was queried about her general status and the condition of her CDAD and related symptoms. Stool samples were collected at baseline and Weeks 1,2,4 and 8 post-treatment to assess changes in the gut microbiota via 16S sequencing and spore count with methods explained previously (e.g. see Examples 11 and 12). Through 4 weeks post treatment, each patient has gradually improved with no evidence of C. difficile recurrence. [0325] Six other patients with recurrent C. difficile-associated diarrhea were treated in a similar fashion, with no CDI recurrence and no requirement for resumption of antibiotics (total of 8 patients). Additionally, there were no treatmentrelated serious adverse events. Example 19: Treatment of fecal suspensions with ethanol or heat drastically reduces vegetative cell numbers and results in an enrichment of spore forming species [0326] Treatment of a sample, preferably a human fecal sample, in a manner to inactivate or kill substantially all of the vegetative forms of bacteria present in the sample results in selection and enrichment of the spore fraction. Methods for inactivation can include heating, sonication, detergent lysis, enzymatic digestion (such as lysozyme and/or proteinase Κ), ethanol or acid treatment, exposure to solvents (Tetrahydrofuran, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 1,2 propanediol, 1,3 propanediol, butanoate, propanoate, chloroform, dimethyl ether and a detergent like triton Χ-100, diethyl ether), or a combination of these methods. To demonstrate the efficacy of ethanol induced inactivation of vegetative cells, a 10% fecal suspension was mixed with absolute ethanol in a 1:1 ratio and vortexed to mix for 1 min. The suspension was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, 1 h, 4 h or 24 h. After incubation the suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min to pellet spores. The supernatant is discarded and the pellet is resuspended in equal volume of PBS. Viable cells were measured as described below. [0327] To demonstrate the efficacy of heat treatment on vegetative cell inactivation a 10-20% fecal suspension was incubated at 70C, 80C, 90C or 100C for 10 min or 1 h. [0328] After ethanol or heat treatment, remaining viable cells were measured after 24 h incubation on plates by determining the bacterial titer on Brucella blood agar (ΒΒΑ) as a function of treatment and time (See Figure 6). Ethanol treatment for 1 h and 25 h have similar effects, reducing the number of viable cells by approximately 4 logs, while increasing temperature and time at high temperature leads to higher losses in viable cell number, with no colonies detectable at 100°C at either 10 min or 1 h. In this experiment no germinants were used. After several days of additional growth on plates, a number of colonies were picked from these treated samples and identified by 16S rDNA analysis (e.g. see Examples 11 and 12). These included known spore forming Clostridium spp. as well as species not previously reported to be spore formers including Ruminococcus bromii, and Anaerotruncus colihominis (Lawson, et al 2004), and a Eubacterium sp. (Table 4). See Figure 6: Heat and ethanol treatments reduce cell viability [0329] To demonstrate that vegetative cells are greatly reduced by ethanol treatment, known non-spore forming bacteria are ethanol treated as described previously (e.g. see Example 15) and viability was determined by plating on ΒΒΑ in anaerobic conditions (e.g. see Example 14). Fecal material from four independent donors was exposed to 60C for 5 min and subsequently plated on three types of selective media under either aerobic (+ Ο2) or anaerobic conditions (- Ο2) (BBA+aerobic, MacConkey lactose+aerobic, Bacteroides Bile esculin+anaerobic) to identify known nonsporeforming Enterobacteria (survivors on MacConkey agar) and Bacteroides fragilis group species (survivors on Bacteroides Bile Esculin plates). The detectable limit for these assays was roughly 20 cfu/mL. Germinants were not used in this experiment (Figure 7). Both ethanol and heat inactivation greatly reduces the cell viability from fecal material to the limit of detection under using MacConkey lactose agar and ΒΒΕ agar. The remaining cells identified on ΒΒΑ media grown in anaerobic conditions comprise the non-germinant dependent spore forming species. See Figure 7: Reduction in non-spore forming vegetative cells by treatment at 60°C for 5 min [0330] Additionally, the ethanol treatment was shown to rapidly kill both aerobic and non-spore forming anaerobic colony forming units in 10% fecal suspensions as determined by plating on rich (ΒΒΑ) media. The reduction of plated CFUs decreases four orders of magnitude in seconds as shown in Figure 8. [0331] See Figure 8: Time course demonstrates ethanol reduces both anaerobic and aerobic bacterial CFUs Example 20: Species identified and isolated as spore formers by ethanol treatment [0332] To demonstrate that spore-forming species are enriched by heat or ethanol treatment methods, a comparison of >7000 colony isolates was performed to identify species in a repeatable fashion (e.g., identified independently in multiple preparations, see examples 1,2, and 3) only isolated from fecal suspensions treated with 50% ethanol or heat treatment and not from untreated fecal suspensions (Table 5). These data demonstrate the ability to select for spore forming species from fecal material, and identify organisms as spore formers not previously described as such in the literature. In each case, organisms were picked as an isolated colony, grown anaerobically, and then subjected to full-length 16S sequencing in order to assign species identity. [0333] To further identify spore formers, ethanol treated fecal samples from donors A, Β, C, D, Ε and F were plated to a variety of solid media types, single colonies were picked and grown up in broth in a 96 well format (Table 6-11). The 16S rRNA gene was then amplified by PCR and direct cycle sequencing was performed (See examples 11 and 12). The ID is based on the forward read from direct cycle sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. [0334] There is surprising heterogeneity in the microbiome from one individual to another (Clemente et al., 2012) and this has consequences for determining the potential efficacy of various donors to generate useful spore compositions. The method described below is useful for screening donors when, for instance, a particular quantity or diversity of spore forming organisms is useful or desired for repopulating the microbiome following antibiotic treatment or treating a particular disease or condition. Further, such screening is useful when there is a need to screen donors for the purpose of isolating microorganisms capable of spore formation, or when a purified preparation of spore forming organisms is desired from a particular donor. [0335] Total spore count is also a measure of potency of a particular donation or purified spore preparation and is vital to determine the quantity of material required to achieve a desired dose level. To understand the variability in total spore counts, donor samples were collected and processed as described in prior examples. Donor spore counts in CFU/g were then determined by growth on media plates at various titrations to determine the spore content of the donation. Furthermore, DPA assays were used to assess spore content (expressed as spore equivalents) as described in Example 21. As seen in Figure 9, there is as much as two logs difference in an individual donor over time and can be up to three logs difference between donors. One possible reason for the difference in spore content measures is that nonviable spores and non-germinable spores will not be observed by plating but will have measurable DPA content. Another possibility is the variability between species of DPA content in spores making some complex mixtures containing high DPA spores while other mixtures contain low DPA content spores. Selecting donors with high spore counts is important in determining productivity of isolating spores from fecal donations by identifying preferred donors. [0336] See Figure 9: Donation Spore concentrations from clinical donors [0337] A fresh fecal sample from donor F was treated as described in Example 15 to generate an ethanol treated spore fraction, germinated with ΒΗIS/Oxgall for 1h as a described (e.g. see Example 13), then plated to a variety of media (e.g. See example 14). Colonies were picked with a focus on picking several of each type of morphologically distinct colony on each plate to capture as much diversity as possible. Colonies are counted on a plate of each media type with well isolated colonies such that the number of colony forming units per ml can be calculated (Table 12). Colonies were picked into one of several liquid media and the 16S rDNA sequences (e.g. see Examples 11 and 12) were determined and analyzed as described above. The number of unique OTUs for each media type is shown below with the media with the most unique OTUs at the top (Table 12). Combinations of 3 to 5 of the top 5 media types capture diversity, and some other can be chosen to target specific species of interest. Colony forming units can be calculated for a given species using the 16S data, and could be used to determine whether a sufficient level of a given organism is present. The spore complement from Donor F as determined in this experiment includes these 52 species as determined by 16S sequencing (Table 12). [0338] To screen human donors for the presence of a diversity of spore forming bacteria and/or for specific spore-forming bacteria, fecal samples were prepared using germinants and selective plating conditions and colonies were picked (e.g. see Examples 13 and 14) and analyzed for 16S diversity as described previously (see Examples 11 and 12). An assessment of donor diversity could include the cfu/ml of ethanol resistant cells on a given media type, or cfu/ml of a given species using the 16S analysis of colonies picked from that media to determine the level of spores of a given species of interest. This type of culture-based analysis could be complemented by culture-independent methods such as qPCR with probes specific to species or genera of interest or metagenomic sequencing of spore preparations, or 16S profiling of spore preparations using lllumina 16S variable region sequencing approaches (e.g. see Examples 11 and 12). Example 21: Quantification of Spore Concentrations using DPA assay [0339] Methods to assess spore concentration in complex mixtures typically require the separation and selection of spores and subsequent growth of individual species to determine the colony forming units. The art does not teach how to quantitatively germinate all the spores in a complex mixture as there are many species for which appropriate germinants have not been identified. Furthermore, sporulation is thought to be a stochastic process as a result of evolutionary selection, meaning that not all spores from a single species germinate with same response to germinant concentration, time and other environmental conditions. Alternatively, a key metabolite of bacterial spores, dipicolinic acid (DPA) has been developed to quantify spores particles in a sample and avoid interference from fecal contaminants. The assay utilizes the fact that DPA chelates Terbium 3+ to form a luminescent complex (Fichtel et al, FEMS Microbiology Ecology, 2007; Kort et al, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 2005; Shafaat and Ponce, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 2006; Yang and Ponce, International Journal of Food Microbiology, 2009; Hindle and Flail, Analyst, 1999). A time-resolved fluorescence assay detects terbium luminescence in the presence of DPA giving a quantitative measurement of DPA concentration in a solution. [0340] To perform the assay 1 ml. of the spore standard to be measured was transferred to a 2mL microcentrifuge tube. The samples were centrifuged at 13000 RCF for 10 min and the sample is washed in 1mL sterile deionized Fl20. Wash an additional time by repeating the centrifugation. Transfer the 1ml_ solution to hungate tubes and autoclave samples on a steam cycle for 30 min at 250C. Add 100uL of 30uM TbCF solution (400η∩Μ sodium acetate, pFH 5.0, 30μΜ TbCF) to the sample. Make serial dilutions of of the autoclaved material and measure the fluorescence of each sample by exciting with 275∩η∩ light and measuring the emission wavelength of 543ηη∩ for an integration time of 1,25ms and a 0.1 ms delay. [0341] Purified spores are produced as described previously (e.g. see http://www.epa.gov/Desticides/methods/MB-28-00.pdf). Serial dilutions of purified spores from C. bifermentans, C. sporogenes, and C. butyricum cultures were prepared and measured by plating on ΒΒΑ media and incubating overnight at 37C to determine CFU/ml. Figure 10 shows the linear correspondence across different spore producing bacteria across several logs demonstrating the DPA assay as means to assess spore content. [0342] See Figure 10: Linear range of DPA assay compared to CFU counts/ml [0343] The discrepancy for complex spore populations between spore counts measured by germinable spore CFU and by DPA has important implications for determining the potency of an ethanol treated spore preparation for clinical use. Table AC shows spore content data from 3 different ethanol treated spore preparations used to successfully treat 3 patients suffering from recurrent C. difficile infection. The spore content of each spore preparation is characterized using the two described methods. Table AC. Spore quantitation for ethanol treated spore preparations using spore CFU (SCFU) assay and DPA assay Preparation SCFU / 30 capsules DPA SEq / 30 capsules Ratio SCFU / DPA Preparation 1 4.0 χ 105 6.8 χ 107 5.9 χ 10-3 Preparation 2 2.1 χ 107 9.2 χ 108 0.023 Preparation 3 6.9 χ 109 9.6 χ 109 0.72 [0344] What is immediately apparent is that spore content varies greatly per 30 capsules. As measured by germinable SCFU, spore content varies by greater than 10,000-fold. As measured by DPA, spore content varies by greater than 100-fold. In the absence of the DPA assay, it would be difficult to set a minimum dose for administration to a patient. For instance, without data from the DPA assay, one would conclude that a minimum effective dose of spores is 4 χ 105 or less using the SCFU assay (e.g. Preparation 1, Table AC). If that SCFU dose was used to normalize dosing in a clinical setting, however, then the actual spore doses given to patients would be much lower for other ethanol treated spore preparations as measured as by the DPA assay (Table AD). Table AD. DPA doses in Table AC when normalized to 4 χ 105SCFU per dose Preparation SCFU / 30 capsules DPA SEq / 30 Fraction of Preparation 1 capsules Dose Preparation 1 4.0 χ 105 6.8 χ 107 1.0 Preparation 2 4.0 χ 105 1.8 χ 107 0.26 Preparation 3 4.0 χ 105 5.6 χ 105 0.0082 [0345] It becomes clear from the variability of SCFU and DPA counts across various donations that using SCFU as the measure of potency would lead to significant underdosing in certain cases. For instance, setting a dose specification of 4 χ 105SCFU (the apparent effective dose from donor Preparation 1) for product Preparation 3 would lead to a potential underdosing of more than 100-fold. This can be rectified only by setting potency specifications based on the DPA assay, which better reflects total spore counts in an ethanol treated spore preparation. The unexpected finding of this work is that the DPA assay is uniquely suited to set potency and determine dosing for an ethanol treated spore preparation. Example 22: Demonstration of enhanced growth with a qerminant [0346] To enhance the ethanol treated spores germination capability and demonstrate spore viability, spores from three different donors were germinated by various treatments and plated on various media. Germination with BHIS/oxgall (BHIS ox), Ca-DPA, rumen fluid (RF), simulated gastric fluid (SGF), mucin medium (Muc), fetal bovine serum (FBS), or thioglycollate (Thi) for 1 hour at 37C in anaerobic conditions was performed as described previously (e.g. see Examples 13 and 14) with samples derived from two independent donors (Figure 11). The sporegerminant mixture was serially diluted and plated on different plate media including ΒΒΑ, Sweet Β, Sweet Β + lysozyme (2ug/ml), M2GSC and M2GSC + lysozyme (2ug/ml) as previously described (e.g. see Examples 13 and 14) to determine spore germination. Colony forming units were tallied and titers were determined using standard techniques by one skilled in the art. As Figure 11 shows, maximum colony forming units are derived from BHI-oxgall treatment. This germination treatment also greatly increases the diversity as measured by the number of OTUs identified when samples were submitted for 16S sequencing (e.g. see Examples 11 and 12) compared to plating without a germination step (Figure 12). As shown in Figure 11: Different germinant treatments have variable effects on CFU counts from donor A (upper left) and donor Β (lower right). The Y-Axes are spore CFU per ml. As shown in Figure 12: Germinates greatly increase the diversity of cultured spore forming OTUs. [0347] To test the effect of heat activation to promote germination, ethanol treated fecal samples were treated for 15 min at room temperature, 55C, 65C, 75C or 85C from three different donors and germinated subsequently with BHIS+ Oxgall for 1 hr at 37C then plated on ΒΒΑ media (Figure 13) as previously described (e.g. see Examples 13 and 14). Pretreatment at room temperature produced equal if not more spores than the elevated temperatures in all three donors. The temperature of germinating was also examined by incubating samples at room temperature or 37C for 1 hr in anaerobic conditions before plating on ΒΒΑ. No difference in the number of CFUs was observed between the two conditions. Lysozyme addition to the plates (2ug/ml) was also tested on a single donor sample by the testing of various activation temperature followed by an incubation in the presence or absence of lysozyme. The addition of lysozyme had a small effect when plated on Sweet Β or M2GSC media but less so than treatment with BHIS oxgall without lysozyme for 1 hr (Figure 14). [0348] As shown in Figure 13: Heat Activation as a germination treatment with BHIS+oxgall. As shown in Figure 14: Effect of lysozyme slightly enhances germination. [0349] Germination time was also tested by treating a 10% suspension of a single donor ethanol treated feces (e.g. see Example 15) incubated in either BHIS, taurocholate, oxgall, or germix for 0, 15, 30, or 60 minutes and subsequently plated on BHIS, ΕΥΑ, or ΒΒΑ media (e.g. see Examples 13 and 14). 60 minutes resulted in the most CFU units across all various combinations germinates and plate media tested. Example 23: Demonstrating efficacy of qerminable and sporulatable fractions of ethanol treated spores [0350] To define methods for characterization and purification, and to improve (e.g., such as by modulating the diversity of the compositions) the active spore forming ecology derived from fecal donations, the ethanol treated spore population (as described in Example 15) was further fractionated. A “germinable fraction” was derived by treating the ethanol-treated spore preparation with oxgall, plating to various solid media, and then, after 2 days or 7 days of growth, scraping all the bacterial growth from the plates into 5 ml. of PBS per plate to generate a bacterial suspension. A “sporulatable fraction” was derived as above except that the cells were allowed to grow on solid media for 2 days or 7 days (the time was extended to allow sporulation, as is typical in sporulation protocols), and the resulting bacterial suspension was treated with 50% ethanol to derive a population of “sporulatable” spores, or species that were capable of forming spores. In preparing these fractions, fecal material from donor A was used to generate an ethanol treated spore preparation as previously described in Example 15; then spore content was determined by DPA assay and CFU/ml grown on various media (Figure 15) as previously described (see Example 21). See Figure 15: Spores initially present in ethanol treated spore preparation as measured by DPA and CFU/ml grown on specified media. [0351] To characterize the fraction that is sporulatable, the 2 day and 7 day “germinable” fractions were assessed for CFU and DPA content before and after ethanol treatment to generate a spore fraction. Bacterial suspensions were treated with ethanol, germinated with Oxgall, and plated on the same types of media that the “germinable” fraction was grown on. DPA data showed that growth on plates for 2 and 7 days produced the same amount of total spores. Colonies on the several types of media were picked for 16S sequence analysis to identify the spore forming bacteria present (Table 13). [0352] A 2 day “germinable” fraction and a 7 day “sporulatable” fraction were used as a treatment in the mouse prophylaxis assay as described (e.g. see Example 16). As a control, a 10% fecal suspension prepared from a donor (Donor Β) was also administered to mice to model fecal microbiota transplant (FMT). Weight loss and mortality of the various test and control arms of the study are plotted in Figure 17 and summarized in Table 15 which also contains the dosing information. The data clearly shows both the “germinable” and “sporulatable” fractions are efficacious in providing protection against C. difficile challenge in a prophylaxis mouse model (e.g. see Example 16). The efficacy of these fractions further demonstrates that the species present are responsible for the efficacy of the spore fraction, as the fractionation further dilutes any potential contaminant from the original spore preparation. [0353] See Figure 16: Titer of “germinable” fraction after 2 days (left) and Sporulatable fraction (right) by DPA and CFU/ml. The “sporulatable” fraction made following 7 days of growth was measured as previously described using germination and growth assays or DPA content as previously described (see Example 21). [0354] The species present in the “germinable” and “sporulatable” fractions were determined by full length 16S sequencing of colony picks and by 16S NGS sequencing of the fractions themselves. The colony pick data indicate Clostridium species are very abundant in both fractions, while the NGS data reveal other spore forming organisms that are typically found in ethanol treated spore preparations are present. [0355] Results are shown in the following: See Table 13. Species identified as “germinable” and “sporulatable” by colony picking approach. See Table ΥΥΥ. Species identified as “germinable” using 16S-V4 NGS approach. See Table ΖΖΖ. Species identified as “sporulatable” using 16s-V4 NGS approach. See Figure 17: Mouse prophylaxis model demonstrates “germinable” and “sporulatable” preparations are protective against C. difficile challenge. Each plot tracks the change in the individual mouse’s weight relative to day -1 over the course of the experiment. The number of deaths over the course of the experiment is indicated at the top of the chart and demonstrated by a line termination prior to day 6. The top panels (from left to right) are the vehicle control arm, the fecal suspension arm, and the untreated naive control arm, while the bottom panels are the ethanol treated, gradient purified spore preparation; the ethanol treated, gradient purified, “germinable” preparation, and ethanol treated, gradient purified, “sporulatable” preparation. See Table 15: Results of the prophylaxis mouse model and dosing information Example 24: Donor pooling efficacy in prophylaxis mouse [0356] To test the efficacy and dosing of pooled donor samples the C. difficile prophylaxis mouse model (e.g., see Example 16) is used with donations mixed from two or more donor samples as previously described. Weight loss and mortality with the mixed spore product versus the spore product derived from a single donor at the various dosing is determine whether the two treatment schemes are equivalent or one is significantly better than the other. [0357] Dosing of the spore product derived from a single or multiple donors is between 1Ε4 to 1Ε10 CFU/ml. The spore product is mixed from product derived from any number of donors ranging from 1-10 at either equal concentrations or different known concentrations. [0358] Additionally, this method can be used to expand the spore fraction for production purposes. For production purposes, an enriched spore fraction (e.g. - a purified and EtOFI treated fraction of a fecal sample) is preserved in multiple aliquots to form a bank of viable spore-forming organisms. An aliquot of this bank is then recovered by germinant treatment followed by cultivation in a medium, and under conditions, that are broadly permissive for spore-forming organisms and encourage sporulation. After a suitable amplification time, the amplified bacteria including spores are harvested, and this preparation is solvent or heat-treated to isolate the spore fraction. This fraction may be further purified away from non-spore forms and culture constituents. The process of amplification, spore isolation and optional purification may be repeated at increasing scales to generate large quantities for further use. When enough germinable/sporulatable material has been accumulated by amplification, it may be further purified, concentrated or diluted, and/or preserved to a state suitable for further use, e.g. - clinical dosing. [0359] Features may be incorporated into the above process to make it suitable for further utility, especially for product applications such as clinical use. The production of the initial spore fraction may be conducted under controlled conditions (cGMP’s) and validated to remove non-spore organisms to a high degree. The germination may be conducted using reagents that are more standardizable than natural products such as oxgall, e.g. - synthetic mixtures of bile salts. Amplification may be done using media with components that are preferred for clinical safety, e.g. - sourced from qualified animals, or non-animal sourced. Conditions may be arranged so as to ensure consistent compositions of sporulated organisms, are less prone to contamination, and are more amenable to scale-up, e.g. - closed stirred fermenters with feedback control loops. Sporulated organisms from the process may be isolated using procedures that alone or combined stringently eliminate nonspores and other process residuals, e.g. - solvent treatment, aqueous two-phase extraction, and/or 60° C long-time heat treatment. Preservation may involve addition of excipients and/or adjustment of conditions to enable conversion to a preferred dosage form amenable to long-term shelf storage, e.g. - addition of trehalose, followed by lyophilization or spray drying, further blending of the powder with microcrystalline cellulose, and encapsulation in a gelatin capsule to form an orally dosable product. Example 25: Engraftment, Augmentation and reduction of Pathogen Carriage in Patients Treated with Spore Compositions [0360] Complementary genomic and microbiological methods were used to characterize the composition of the microbiota from Patient 1,2, 3, 4, and 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 at pretreatment (pretreatment) and on up to 4 weeks post-treatment. [0361] To determine the OTUs that engraft from treatment with an ethanol treated spore preparation in the patients and how their microbiome changed in response, the microbiome was characterized by 16S-V4 sequencing prior to treatment (pretreatment) with an ethanol treated spore preparation and up to 25 days after receiving treatment. As example, the treatment of patient 1 with an ethanol treated spore preparation led to the engraftment of OTUs from the spore treatment and augmentation in the microbiome of the patient (Figure 18 and Figure 19). By day 25 following treatment, the total microbial carriage was dominated by species of the following taxonomic groups: Bacteroides, Sutterella, Ruminococcus, Blautia, Eubacterium, Gemmiger/Faecalibacterium, and the non-sporeforming Lactobacillus (see Table 16 and Table 2 for specific OTUs). The first two genera represent OTUs that do not form spores while the latter taxonomic groups represent OTUs that are believed to form spores. [0362] Patient treatment with the ethanol treated spore preparation leads to the establishment of a microbial ecology that has greater diversity than prior to treatment (Figure 18). Genomic-based microbiome characterization confirmed engraftment of a range of OTUs that were absent in the patient pretreatment (Table 16). These OTUs comprised both bacterial species that were capable and not capable of forming spores, and OTUs that represent multiple phylogenetic clades. Organisms absent in Patient 1 pre-treatment either engraft directly from the ethanol treated spore fraction or are augmented by the creation of a gut environment favoring a healthy, diverse microbiota. Furthermore, Bacteroides fragilis group species were increased by 4 and 6 logs in patients 1 and 2 (Figure 20). [0363] OTUs that comprise an augmented ecology are not present in the patient prior to treatment and/or exist at extremely low frequencies such that they do not comprise a significant fraction of the total microbial carriage and are not detectable by genomic and/or microbiological assay methods. OTUs that are members of the engrafting and augmented ecologies were identified by characterizing the OTUs that increase in their relative abundance post treatment and that respectively are: (i) present in the ethanol treated spore preparation and absent in the patient pretreatment, or (ii) absent in the ethanol treated spore preparation, but increase in their relative abundance through time post treatment with the preparation due to the formation of favorable growth conditions by the treatment. Notably, the latter OTUs can grow from low frequency reservoirs in the patient, or be introduced from exogenous sources such as diet. OTUs that comprise a “core” augmented or engrafted ecology can be defined by the percentage of total patients in which they are observed to engraft and/or augment; the greater this percentage the more likely they are to be part of a core ecology responsible for catalyzing a shift away from a dysbiotic ecology. The dominant OTUs in an ecology can be identified using several methods including but not limited to defining the OTUs that have the greatest relative abundance in either the augmented or engrafted ecologies and defining a total relative abundance threshold. As example, the dominant OTUs in the augmented ecology of Patient-1 were identified by defining the OTUs with the greatest relative abundance, which together comprise 60% of the microbial carriage in this patient’s augmented ecology. [0364] See Figure 18: Microbial diversity measured in the ethanol treated spore treatment sample and patient pre- and post-treatment samples. Total microbial diversity is defined using the Chaol Alpha-Diversity Index and is measured at different genomic sampling depths to confirm adequate sequence coverage to assay the microbiome in the target samples. The patient pretreatment (purple) harbored a microbiome that was significantly reduced in total diversity as compared to the ethanol treated spore treatment (red) and patient post treatment at days 5 (blue), 14 (orange), and 25 (green). [0365] See Figure 19: Patient microbial ecology is shifted by treatment with an ethanol treated spore treatment from a dysbiotic state to a state of health. Principle Coordinates Analysis based on the total diversity and structure of the microbiome (Bray-Curtis Beta-Diversity) of the patient pre- and post-treatment delineates that the engraftment of OTUs from the spore treatment and the augmentation of the patient microbial ecology leads to a microbial ecology that is distinct from both the pretreatment microbiome and the ecology of the ethanol treated spore treatment (Table 16). [0366] See Figure 20: Augmentation of Bacteroides species in patients. Comparing the number of Bacteroides fragilis groups species per cfu/g of feces pre-treatment and in week 4 post treatment reveals an increase of 4 logs or greater. The ability of 16S-V4 OTU identification to assign an OTU as a specific species depends in part on the resolution of the 16S-V4 region of the 16S gene for a particular species or group of species. Both the density of available reference 16S sequences for different regions of the tree as well as the inherent variability in the 16S gene between different species will determine the definitiveness of a taxonomic annotation to a given sequence read. Given the topological nature of a phylogenetic tree and that the tree represents hierarchical relationships of OTUs to one another based on their sequence similarity and an underlying evolutionary model, taxonomic annotations of a read can be rolled up to a higher level using a clade-based assignment procedure (Table 1). Using this approach, clades are defined based on the topology of a phylogenetic tree that is constructed from full-length 16S sequences using maximum likelihood or other phylogenetic models familiar to individuals with ordinary skill in the art of phylogenetics. Clades are constructed to ensure that all OTUs in a given clade are: (i) within a specified number of bootstrap supported nodes from one another (generally, 1-5 bootstraps), and (ii) within a 5% genetic similarity. OTUs that are within the same clade can be distinguished as genetically and phylogenetically distinct from OTUs in a different clade based on 16S-V4 sequence data. OTUs falling within the same clade are evolutionarily closely related and may or may not be distinguishable from one another using 16S-V4 sequence data. The power of clade based analysis is that members of the same clade, due to their evolutionary relatedness, play similar functional roles in a microbial ecology such as that found in the human gut. Compositions substituting one species with another from the same clade are likely to have conserved ecological function and therefore are useful in the present invention. [0367] Stool samples were aliquoted and resuspended 10χ vol/wt in either 100% ethanol (for genomic characterization) or PBS containing 15% glycerol (for isolation of microbes) and then stored at -80°C until needed for use. For genomic 16S sequence analysis colonies picked from plate isolates had their full-length 16S sequence characterized as described in Examples 11 and 12, and primary stool samples were prepared targeting the 16S-V4 region using the method for heterogeneous samples in Example 10. [0368] Notably, 16S sequences of isolates of a given OTU are phylogenetically placed within their respective clades despite that the actual taxonomic assignment of species and genus may suggest they are taxonomically distinct from other members of the clades in which they fall. Discrepancies between taxonomic names given to an OTU is based on microbiological characteristics versus genetic sequencing are known to exist from the literature. The OTUs footnoted in this table are known to be discrepant between the different methods for assigning a taxonomic name. [0369] Engraftment of OTUs from the ethanol treated spore preparation treatment into the patient as well as the resulting augmentation of the resident microbiome led to a significant decrease in and elimination of the carriage of pathogenic species other than C. difficile in the patient. 16S-V4 sequencing of primary stool samples demonstrated that at pretreatment, 20% of reads were from the genus Klebsiella and an additional 19% were assigned to the genus Fusobacterium. These striking data are evidence of a profoundly dysbiotic microbiota associated with recurrent C. difficile infection and chronic antibiotic use. In healthy individuals, Klebsiella is a resident of the human microbiome in only about 2% of subjects based on an analysis of ΗΜΡ database (www.hmpdacc.org), and the mean relative abundance of Klebsiella is only about 0.09% in the stool of these people. It’s surprising presence at 20% relative abundance in Patient 1 before treatment is an indicator of a proinflammatory gut environment enabling a “pathobiont” to overgrow and outcompete the commensal organisms normally found in the gut. Similarly, the dramatic overgrowth of Fusobacterium indicates a profoundly dysbiotic gut microbiota. One species of Fusobacterium, F. nucleatum (an OTU phylogenetically indistinguishable from Fusobacterium sp. 3_1_33 based on 16S-V4), has been termed “an emerging gut pathogen” based on its association with IBD, Crohn’s disease, and colorectal cancer in humans and its demonstrated causative role in the development of colorectal cancer in animal models [Allen-Vercoe, Gut Microbes (2011) 2:294-8]. Importantly, neither Klebsiella nor Fusobacterium was detected in the 16S-V4 reads by Day 25 (Table 18). [0370] To further characterize the colonization of the gut by Klebsiella and other Enterobacteriaceae and to speciate these organisms, pretreatment and Day 25 fecal samples stored at -80C as PBS-glycerol suspensions were plated on a variety of selective media including MacConkey lactose media (selective for gram negative enterobacteria) and Simmons Citrate Inositol media (selective for Klebsiella spp) [Van Cregten et al, J. Clin. Microbiol. (1984) 20: 936-41], Enterobacteria identified in the patient samples included Κ. pneumoniae, Klebsiella sp. Co_9935 and Ε. coli. Strikingly, each Klebsiella species was reduced by 2-4 logs whereas Ε. coli, a normal commensal organism present in a healthy microbiota, was reduced by less than 1 log (Table 19). This decrease in Klebsiella spp. carriage is consistent across multiple patients (Table 19). Four separate patients were evaluated for the presence of Klebsiella spp. pre treatment and 4 weeks post treatment. Klebsiella spp. were detected by growth on selective Simmons Citrate Inositol media as previously described. Serial dilution and plating, followed by determining cfu/mL titers of morphologically distinct species and 16S full length sequence identification of representatives of those distinct morphological classes, allowed calculation of titers of specific species. [0371] The genus Bacteroides is an important member of the gastrointestinal microbiota; 100% of stool samples from the Human Microbiome Project contain at least one species of Bacteroides with total relative abundance in these samples ranging from 0.96% to 93.92% with a median relative abundance of 52.67% (www.hmpdacc.org reference data set HMSMCP). Bacteroides in the gut has been associated with amino acid fermentation and degradation of complex polysaccharides. Its presence in the gut is enhanced by diets rich in animal-derived products as found in the typical western diet [David, L. A. et al, Nature (2013) doi:10.1038/nature12820]. Strikingly, prior to treatment, fewer than 0.008% of the 16S-V4 reads from Patient 1 mapped to the genus Bacteroides strongly suggesting that Bacteroides species were absent or that viable Bacteroides were reduced to an extremely minor component of the patient’s gut microbiome. Post treatment, >42% of the 16S-V4 reads could be assigned to the genus Bacteroides within 5 days of treatment and by Day 25 post treatment 59.48% of the patients gut microbiome was comprised of Bacteroides. These results were confirmed microbiologically by the absence of detectable Bacteroides in the pretreatment sample plated on two different Bacteroides selective media: Bacteroides Bile Esculin (ΒΒΕ) agar which is selective for Bacteroides fragilis group species [Livingston, S.J.et al J. Clin. Microbiol (1978). 7: 448-453] and Polyamine Free Arabinose (PFA) agar [Noack et al. J. Nutr. (1998) 128: 1385-1391; modified by replacing glucose with arabinose]. The highly selective ΒΒΕ agar had a limit of detection of <2x103 cfu/g, while the limit of detection for Bacteroides on PFA agar was approximately 2x107 cfu/g due to the growth of multiple non-Bacteroides species in the pretreatment sample on that medium. Colony counts of Bacteroides species on Day 25 were up to 2x1010 cfu/g, consistent with the 16S-V4 sequencing, demonstrating a profound reconstitution of the gut microbiota in Patient 1 (Table 20). [0372] The significant abundance of Bacteroides in Patient 1 on Day 25 (and as early as Day 5 as shown by 16S-V4 sequencing) is remarkable. Viable Bacteroides fragilis group species were not present in the ethanol treated spore population based on microbiological plating (limit of detection of 10 cfu/ml). Thus, administration of the ethanol treated spore population to Patient 1 resulted not only in the engraftment of spore-forming species, but also the restoration of high levels of non-spore forming species commonly found in healthy individuals through the creation of a niche that allowed for the repopulation of Bacteroides species. These organisms were most likely either present at extremely low abundance in the Gl tract of Patient 1, or present in a reservoir in the Gl tract from which they could rebound to high titer. Those species may also be reinoculated via oral uptake from food following treatment. We term this healthy repopulation of the gut with OTUs that are not present in the ethanol treated spore population “Augmentation.” Augmentation is an important phenomenon in that it shows the ability to use an ethanol treated spore ecology to restore a healthy microbiota by seeding a diverse array or commensal organisms beyond the actual component organisms in the ethanol treated spore population itself; specifically the spore treatment itself and the engraftment of OTUs from the spore composition create a niche that enables the outgrowth of OTUs required to shift a dysbiotic microbiome to a microbial ecology that is associated with health. The diversity of Bacteroides species and their approximate relative abundance in the gut of Patient 1 is shown in Table 21, comprising at least 8 different species. [0373] See Figure 21: Species Engrafting versus Species Augmenting in patients microbiomes after treatment with an ethanol-treated spore population. Relative abundance of species that engrafted or augmented as described were determined based on the number of 16S sequence reads. Each plot is from a different patient treated with the ethanol-treated spore population for recurrent C. difficile. [0374] The impact of ethanol treated spore population treatment on carriage of imipenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae was assessed by plating pretreatment and Day 28 clinical samples from Patients 2, 4 and 5 on MacConkey lactose plus 1 ug/mL of imipenem. Resistant organisms were scored by morphology, enumerated and DNA was submitted for full length 16S rDNA sequencing as described above. Isolates were identified as Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri and Proteus pennerii. Each of these are gut commensal organisms; overgrowth can lead to bacteremia and/or urinary tract infections requiring aggressive antibiotic treatment and, in some cases, hospitalization [Kim, Β-Ν, et al Scan J. Inf Dis (2003) 35: 98-103; Lee, l-K and Liu, J-W J. Microbiol Immunol Infect (2006) 39: 328-334; O’Hara et al, Clin Microbiol Rev (2000) 13: 534], The titer of organisms at pretreatment and Day 28 by patient is shown in Table 22. Importantly, administration of the ethanol treated spore preparation resulted in greater than 100-fold reduction in 4 of 5 cases of Enterobacteriaceae carriage with multiple imipenem resistant organisms (Table 22). [0375] In addition to speciation and enumeration, multiple isolates of each organism from Patient 4 were grown overnight in 96-well trays containing a 2-fold dilution series of imipenem in order to quantitatively determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotic. Growth of organisms was detected by light scattering at 600 nm on a SpectraMax Μ5℮ plate reader. In the clinical setting, these species are considered resistant to imipenem if they have an MIC of 1 ug/mL or greater. Μ. morganii isolates from pretreatment samples from Patient D had MICs of 2-4 ug/mL and Ρ. pennerii isolates had MICs of 4-8 ug/mL. Thus the ethanol treated spore population administered to Patient 4 caused the clearance of 2 imipenem resistant organisms (Table 16). Example 26. Enrichment and Purification of bacteria. [0376] To purify individual bacterial strains, dilution plates were selected in which the density enables distinct separation of single colonies. Colonies were picked with a sterile implement (either a sterile loop or toothpick) and re-streaked to ΒΒΑ or other solid media. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 3-7 days. One or more wellisolated single colonies of the major morphology type were re-streaked. This process was repeated at least three times until a single, stable colony morphology is observed. The isolated microbe was then cultured anaerobically in liquid media for 24 hours or longer to obtain a pure culture of 106-101° cfu/ml. Liquid growth medium might include Brain Heart Infusion-based medium (Atlas, Handbook of Microbiological Media, 4th ed, ASM Press, 2010) supplemented with yeast extract, hemin, cysteine, and carbohydrates (for example, maltose, cellobiose, soluble starch) or other media described previously (e.g. see example 14). The culture was centrifuged at 10,000 χ g for 5 min to pellet the bacteria, the spent culture media was removed, and the bacteria were resuspended in sterile PBS. Sterile 75% glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20%. An aliquot of glycerol stock was titered by serial dilution and plating. The remainder of the stock was frozen on dry ice for 10-15 min and then placed at -80C for long term storage. Example 27. Cell Bank Preparation. [0377] Cell banks (RCBs) of bacterial strains were prepared as follows. Bacterial strains were struck from -80°C frozen glycerol stocks to Brucella blood agar with Hemin or Vitamin Κ (Atlas, Handbook of Microbiological Media, 4th ed, ASM Press, 2010), M2GSC (Atlas, Handbook of Microbiological Media, 4th ed, ASM Press, 2010) or other solid growth media and incubated for 24 to 48 h at 37°C in an anaerobic chamber with a gas mixture of H2:CC>2:N2 of 10:10:80. Single colonies were then picked and used to inoculate 250 ml to 1 L of Wilkins-Chalgren broth, Brain-Heart Infusion broth, M2GSC broth or other growth media, and grown to mid to late exponential phase or into the stationary phase of growth. Alternatively, the single colonies may be used to inoculate a pilot culture of 10 ml, which were then used to inoculate a large volume culture. The growth media and the growth phase at harvest were selected to enhance cell titer, spoliation (if desired) and phenotypes that might be associated desired in vitro or in vivo. Optionally, Cultures were grown static or shaking, depending which yielded maximal cell titer. The cultures were then concentrated 10 fold or more by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 min, and resuspended in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) plus 15% glycerol. 1 ml aliquots were transferred into 1.8 ml cryovials which were then frozen on dry ice and stored at -80C. The identity of a given cell bank was confirmed by PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA gene, followed by Sanger direct cycle sequencing, and comparison to a curated rDNA database to determine a taxonomic ID. Each bank was confirmed to yield colonies of a single morphology upon streaking to Brucella blood agar or M2GSC agar. When more than one morphology was observed, colonies were confirmed to be the expected species by PCR and sequencing analysis of the 16S rDNA gene. Variant colony morphologies can be observed within pure cultures, and in a variety of bacteria the mechanisms of varying colony morphologies have been well described (van der Woude, Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 17:518, 2004), including in Clostridium species (Wadsworth-KTL Anaerobic Bacteriology Manual, 6th Ed, Jousimie-Somer, et al 2002). For obligate anaerobes, RCBs were confirmed to lack aerobic colony forming units at a limit of detection of 10 cfu/ml. Example 28. Titer Determination. [0378] The number of viable cells per ml was determined on the freshly harvested, washed and concentrated culture by plating serial dilutions of the RCB to Brucella blood agar or other solid media, and varied from 106to 1010 cfu/ml. The impact of freezing on viability was determined by titering the banks after one or two freeze-thaw cycles on dry ice or at -80°C, followed by thawing in an anaerobic chamber at room temperature. Some strains displayed a 1-3 log drop in viable cfu/ml after the 1 st and/or 2nd freeze thaw, while the viability of others were unaffected. Example 29. Preparation of bacterial compositions. [0379] Individual strains were typically thawed on ice and combined in an anaerobic chamber to create mixtures, followed by a second freeze at -80°C to preserve the mixed samples. When making combinations of strains for in vitro or in vivo assays, the cfu in the final mixture was estimated based on the second freezethaw titer of the individual strains. For experiments in rodents, strains may be combined at equal counts in order to deliver between 1 ℮4 and 1 ℮10 per strain. Additionally, some bacteria may not grow to sufficient titer to yield cell banks that allowed the production of compositions where all bacteria were present at 1℮10. Example 30. Identification of Keystone OTUs and Functions [0380] The human body is an ecosystem in which the microbiota, and the microbiome, play a significant role in the basic healthy function of human systems (e.g. metabolic, immunological, and neurological). The microbiota and resulting microbiome comprise an ecology of microorganisms that co-exist within single subjects interacting with one another and their host (i.e., the mammalian subject) to form a dynamic unit with inherent biodiversity and functional characteristics. Within these networks of interacting microbes (i.e. ecologies), particular members can contribute more significantly than others; as such these members are also found in many different ecologies, and the loss of these microbes from the ecology can have a significant impact on the functional capabilities of the specific ecology. Robert Paine coined the concept “Keystone Species” in 1969 (see Paine RT. 1969. A note on trophic complexity and community stability. The American Naturalist 103: 91-93.) to describe the existence of such lynchpin species that are integral to a given ecosystem regardless of their abundance in the ecological community. Paine originally describe the role of the starfish Pisaster ochraceus in marine systems and since the concept has been experimentally validated in numerous ecosystems. [0381] Keystone OTUs and/or Functions are computationally-derived by analysis of network ecologies elucidated from a defined set of samples that share a specific phenotype. Keystone OTUs and/or Functions are defined as all Nodes within a defined set of networks that meet two or more of the following criteria. Using Criterion 1, the node is frequently observed in networks, and the networks in which the node is observed are found in a large number of individual subjects; the frequency of occurrence of these Nodes in networks and the pervasiveness of the networks in individuals indicates these Nodes perform an important biological function in many individuals. Using Criterion 2, the node is frequently observed in networks, and each the networks in which the node is observed contain a large number of Nodes - these Nodes are thus “super-connectors”, meaning that they form a nucleus of a majority of networks and as such have high biological significance with respect to their functional contributions to a given ecology. Using Criterion 3, the node is found in networks containing a large number of Nodes (i.e. they are large networks), and the networks in which the node is found occur in a large number of subjects; these networks are potentially of high interest as it is unlikely that large networks occurring in many individuals would occur by chance alone strongly suggesting biological relevance. Optionally, the required thresholds for the frequency at which a node is observed in network ecologies, the frequency at which a given network is observed across subject samples, and the size of a given network to be considered a Keystone node are defined by the 50th, 70th, 80th, or 90th percentiles of the distribution of these variables. Optionally, the required thresholds are defined by the value for a given variable that is significantly different from the mean or median value for a given variable using standard parametric or non-parametric measures of statistical significance. In another embodiment a Keystone node is defined as one that occurs in a sample phenotype of interest such as but not limited to “health” and simultaneously does not occur in a sample phenotype that is not of interest such as but not limited to “disease.” Optionally, a Keystone Node is defined as one that is shown to be significantly different from what is observed using permuted test datasets to measure significance. Example 31. Identifying the Core Ecology from the Ethanol Treated Spore Preparation [0382] Ten different ethanol treated spore preparations were made from 6 different donors (as described in Example 15). The spore preparations were used to treat 10 patients, each suffering from recurrent C. difficile infection. Patients were identified using the inclusion/exclusion criteria described in Example 18, and donors were identified using the criteria described in Example 1. None of the patients experienced a relapse of C. difficile in the 4 weeks of follow up after treatment, whereas the literature would predict that 70-80% of subjects would experience a relapse following cessation of antibiotic [Van Nood, et al, NEJM (2013)]. Thus, the ethanol treated spore preparations derived from multiple different donors and donations showed remarkable clinical efficacy. [0383] To define the Core Ecology underlying the remarkable clinical efficacy of the ethanol treated spore preparation, the following analysis was carried out. The OTU composition of the spore preparation was determined by 16S-V4 rDNA sequencing and computational assignment of OTUs per Example 12. A requirement to detect at least ten sequence reads in the ethanol treated spore preparation was set as a conservative threshold to define only OTUs that were highly unlikely to arise from errors during amplification or sequencing. Methods routinely employed by those familiar to the art of genomic-based microbiome characterization use a read relative abundance threshold of 0.005% (see e.g. Bokulich, A. et al. 2013. Qualityfiltering vastly improves diversity estimates from lllumina amplicon sequencing. Nature Methods 10: 57-59), which would equate to ≥2 reads given the sequencing depth obtained for the samples analyzed in this example, as cut-off which is substantially lower than the >10 reads used in this analysis . All taxonomic and clade assignments were made for each OTU as described in Examples 12. The resulting list of OTUs, clade assignments, and frequency of detection in the spore preparations are shown in Table GB. OTUs that engraft in a treated patients and the percentage of patients in which they engraft are denoted, as are the clades, spore forming status, and Keystone OTU status. Starred OTUs occur in >80% of the ethanol preps and engraft in >50% of the treated patients. Table GB.

Engraftment is important for two reasons. First, engraftment is a sine qua non of the mechanism to reshape the microbiome and eliminate C. difficile colonization. OTUs that engraft with higher frequency are highly likely to be a component of the Core Ecology of the spore preparation. Second, OTUs detected by sequencing the spore preparation (as in Table GB) may include non-viable spores or other contaminant DNA molecules not associated with spores. The requirement that an OTU must be shown to engraft in the patient eliminates OTUs that represent non-viable spores or contaminating sequences. Table GB also identifies all OTUs detected in the spore preparation that also were shown to engraft in at least one patient post-treatment. OTUs that are present in a large percentage of the ethanol spore preparations analyzed and that engraft in a large number of patients represent a subset of the Core Ecology that are highly likely to catalyze the shift from a dysbiotic disease ecology to a healthy microbiome. [0385] A third lens was applied to further refine insights into the Core Ecology of the spore preparation. Computational-based, network analysis has enabled the description of microbial ecologies that are present in the microbiota of a broad population of healthy individuals. These network ecologies are comprised of multiple OTUs, some of which are defined as Keystone OTUs. Keystone OTUs are computationally defined as described in Example 30. Keystone OTUs form a foundation to the microbially ecologies in that they are found and as such are central to the function of network ecologies in healthy subjects. Keystone OTUs associated with microbial ecologies associated with healthy subjects are often are missing or exist at reduced levels in subjects with disease. Keystone OTUs may exist in low, moderate, or high abundance in subjects. Table GB further notes which of the OTUs in the spore preparation are Keystone OTUs exclusively associated with individuals that are healthy and do not harbor disease. [0386] There are several important findings from this data. A relatively small number of species, 16 in total, are detected in all of the spore preparations from 6 donors and 10 donations. This is surprising because the ΗΜΡ database (www.hmpdacc.org) describes the enormous variability of commensal species across healthy individuals. The presence of a small number of consistent OTUs lends support to the concept of a Core Ecology. The engraftment data further supports this conclusion. A regression analysis shows a significant correlation between frequency of detection in a spore preparation and frequency of engraftment in a donor: R = 0.43 (ρ < 0.001). There is no a priori requirement that an OTU detected frequently in the spore preparation will or should engraft. For instance, Lutispora thermophila, a spore former found in all ten spore preparations, did not engraft in any of the patients. Bilophila wadsworthia, a gram negative anaerobe, is present in 9 of 10 donations, yet it does not engraft in any patient, indicating that it is likely a non-viable contaminant in the ethanol treated spore preparation. Finally, it is worth noting the high preponderance of previously defined Keystone OTUs among the most frequent OTUs in the spore preparations. [0387] These three factors-prevalence in the spore preparation, frequency of engraftment, and designation as a Keystone OTUs--enabled the creation of a “Core Ecology Score” (CES) to rank individual OTUs. CES was defined as follows: • 40% weighting for presence of OTU in spore preparation • multiplier of 1 for presence in 1 -3 spore preparations • multiplier of 2.5 for presence in 4-8 spore preparations • multiplier of 5 for presences in > 9 spore preparations • 40% weighting for engraftment in a patient • multiplier of 1 for engraftment in 1 -4 patients • multiplier of 2.5 for engraftment in 5-6 patients • multiplier of 5 for engraftment in > 7 patients • 20% weighting to Keystone OTUs • multiplier of 1 for a Keystone OTU • multiplier of 0 for a non-Keystone OTU [0388] Using this guide, the CES has a maximum possible score of 5 and a minimum possible score of 0.8. As an example, an OTU found in 8 of the 10 spore preparations that engrafted in 3 patients and was a Keystone OTU would be assigned the follow CES: CES = (0.4 χ 2.5) + (0.4 χ 1) + (0.2 χ 1) = 1.6 [0389] Table GC ranks the top 20 OTUs by CES with the further requirement that an OTU must be shown to engraft to be a considered an element of a core ecology.

Defining Efficacious Subsets of the Core Ecology [0390] The number of organisms in the human gastrointestinal tract, as well as the diversity between healthy individuals, is indicative of the functional redundancy of a healthy gut microbiome ecology (see The Human Microbiome Consortia. 2012. Structure, function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome. Nature 486: 207-214). This redundancy makes it highly likely that subsets of the Core Ecology describe therapeutically beneficial components of the ethanol treated spore preparation and that such subsets may themselves be useful compositions for the treatment of C. difficile infection given the ecologies functional characteristics. Using the CES, individual OTUs can be prioritized for evaluation as an efficacious subset of the Core Ecology. [0391] Another aspect of functional redundancy is that evolutionarily related organisms (i.e. those close to one another on the phylogenetic tree, e.g. those grouped into a single clade) will also be effective substitutes in the Core Ecology or a subset thereof for treating C. difficile. [0392] To one skilled in the art, the selection of appropriate OTU subsets for testing in vitro (e.g. see Example 33 below) or in vivo (e.g. see Examples 16 or 17) is straightforward. Subsets may be selected by picking any 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more than 10 OTUs from Table GB, with a particular emphasis on those with higher CES, such as the OTUs described in Table GC. In addition, using the clade relationships defined in Example 12 and Table 1 above, related OTUs can be selected as substitutes for OTUs with acceptable CES values. These organisms can be cultured anaerobically in vitro using the appropriate media (selected from those described in Example 14 above), and then combined in a desired ratio. Atypical experiment in the mouse C. difficile model utilizes at least 104 and preferably at least 105, 10s, 107, 108, 109 or more than 109 colony forming units of a each microbe in the composition. Variations in the culture yields may sometimes mean that organisms are combined in unequal ratios, e.g. 1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000, 1:10,000, 1:100,000, or greater than 1:100,000. What is important in these compositions is that each strain be provided in a minimum amount so that the strain’s contribution to the efficacy of the Core Ecology subset can be measured. Using the principles and instructions described here, it is straightforward for one of skill in the art to make clade-based substitutions to test the efficacy of subsets of the Core Ecology. Table GB describes the clades for each OTU detected in a spore preparation and Table 1 describes the OTUs that can be used for substitutions based on clade relationships. Example 33. Testing Subsets of the Core Ecology in the Mouse Model [0393] Several subsets of the Core Ecology were tested in the C. difficile mouse model. The negative control was phosphate buffered saline and the positive control was a 10% human fecal suspension. The subsets are described in Table GD.

On day -1, they received either the test articles or control articles via oral gavage. On day 0 they were challenged by administration of approximately 4.5 Iog10 cfu of C. difficile (ATCC 43255) via oral gavage. Mortality was assessed every day from day 0 to day 6 and the weight and subsequent weight change of the animal was assessed with weight loss being associated with C. difficile infection. Mortality and reduced weight loss of the test article compared to the empty vehicle was used to assess the success of the test article. Additionally, a C. difficile symptom scoring was performed each day from day -1 through day 6. Symptom scoring was based on Appearance (0-2 pts based on normal, hunched, piloerection, or lethargic), Respiration (0-2 pts based on normal, rapid or shallow, with abdominal breathing), Clinical Signs (0-2 points based on normal, wet tail, cold-to-the-touch, or isolation from other animals). [0395] In addition to compiling the cumulative mortality for each arm, the average minimum relative weight is calculated as the mean of each mouse’s minimum weight relative to Day -1 and the average maximum clinical score is calculated as the mean of each mouse’s maximum combined clinical score with a score of 4 assigned in the case of death. The results are reported in Table GE. Table GE: Results of bacterial compositions tested in a C. difficile mouse model. Group Dose Cumulative Mortality (%) Avg. Minimum Relative Weight Avg.

Each strain was then diluted 10χ (to a final concentration of 1℮7 CFU/mL of each strain) into 200 uL of PBS + 15% glycerol in the wells of a 96-well plate. Plates were then frozen at -80 °C. When needed for the assay, plates were removed from -80 °C and thawed at room temperature under anaerobic conditions when testing in a in vitro C. difficile inhibition assay (CivSim). [0397] An overnight culture of Clostridium difficile is grown under anaerobic conditions in SweetB-FosIn or other suitable media for the growth of C. difficile. SweetB-Fosin is a complex media composed of brain heart infusion, yeast extract, cysteine, cellobiose, maltose, soluble starch, and fructooligosaccharides/inulin, and hemin, and is buffered with MOPs. After 24 hr of growth the culture is diluted 100,000 fold into a complex media such as SweetB-Fosin which is suitable for the growth of a wide variety of anaerobic bacterial species. The diluted C. difficile mixture is then aliquoted to wells of a 96-well plate (180 uL to each well). 20 uL of a subset Core Ecology is then added to each well at a final concentration of 1℮6 CFU/mL of each species. Alternatively the assay can be tested each species at different initial concentrations (1℮9 CFU/mL, 1℮8 CFU/mL, 1℮7 CFU/mL, 1℮5 CFU/mL, 1℮4 CFU/mL, 1℮3 CFU/mL, 1℮2 CFU/mL). Control wells only inoculated with C. difficile are included for a comparison to the growth of C. difficile without inhibition. Additional wells are used for controls that either inhibit or do not inhibit the growth of C. difficile. One example of a positive control that inhibits growth is a combination of Blautia producta, Clostridium bifermentans and Escherichia coli. One example of a control that shows reduced inhibition of C. difficile growth is a combination of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides vulgatus. Plates are wrapped with parafilm and incubated for 24 hr at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions. After 24 hr the wells containing C. difficile alone are serially diluted and plated to determine titer. The 96-well plate is then frozen at -80C before quantifying C. difficile by qPCR assay. [0398] A standard curve is generated from a well on each assay plate containing only pathogenic C. difficile grown in SweetB + Fosln media and quantified by selective spot plating. Serial dilutions of the culture are performed in sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Genomic DNA is extracted from the standard curve samples along with the other wells. [0399] Genomic DNA is extracted from 5 μΐ of each sample using a dilution, freeze/thaw, and heat lysis protocol. 5 pL of thawed samples is added to 45 pL of UltraPure water (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and mixed by pipetting. The plates with diluted samples are frozen at -20 °C until use for qPCR which includes a heated lysis step prior to amplification. Alternatively the genomic DNA is isolated using the Mo Bio Powersoil®-htp 96 Well Soil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA), Mo Bio Powersoil® DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA), or the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. [0400] The qPCR reaction mixture contains 1χ SsoAdvanced Universal Probes Supermix, 900 ηΜ of Wr-tcdB-F primer (AGCAGTTGΑΑΤATAGTGGTTTAGTTAGAGTTG, IDT, Coralville, IA), 900 ηΜ of Wr-tcdB-R primer (CATGCTTTTTTAGTTTCTGGATTGAA, IDT, Coralville, IA), 250 ηΜ of Wr-tcdB-P probe (6FAM-CATCCAGTCTCAATTGTATATGTTTCTCCA-MGΒ, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and Molecular Biology Grade Water (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) to 18 μI (Primers adapted from: Wroblewski, D. et al., Rapid Molecular Characterization of Clostridium difficile and Assessment of Populations of C. difficile in Stool Specimens, Journal of Clinical Microbiology 47:2142-2148 (2009)). This reaction mixture is aliquoted to wells of a Hard-shell Low-Profile Thin Wall 96-well Skirted PCR Plate (BioRad, Hercules, CA). To this reaction mixture, 2 μΐ of diluted, frozen, and thawed samples are added and the plate sealed with a Microseal ‘B’ Adhesive Seal (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The qPCR is performed on a BioRad C1000™ Thermal Cycler equipped with a CFX96™ Real-Time System (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The thermocycling conditions are 95°C for 15 minutes followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 5 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, and fluorescent readings of the FAM channel. Alternatively, the qPCR is performed with other standard methods known to those skilled in the art. [0401] The Cq value for each well on the FAM channel is determined by the CFX Manager™ 3.0 software. The logio(cfu/mL) of C. difficile each experimental sample is calculated by inputting a given sample’s Cq value into a linear regression model generated from the standard curve comparing the Cq values of the standard curve wells to the known logio(cfu/mL) of those samples. The log inhibition is calculated for each sample by subtracting the logio(cfu/mL) of C. difficile in the sample from the logio(cfu/mL) of C. difficile in the sample on each assay plate used for the generation of the standard curve that has no additional bacteria added. The mean log inhibition is calculated for all replicates for each composition. [0402] A histogram of the range and standard deviation of each composition is plotted. Ranges or standard deviations of the log inhibitions that are distinct from the overall distribution are examined as possible outliers. If the removal of a single log inhibition datum from one of the binary pairs that is identified in the histograms would bring the range or standard deviation in line with those from the majority of the samples, that datum is removed as an outlier, and the mean log inhibition is recalculated. [0403] The pooled variance of all samples evaluated in the assay is estimated as the average of the sample variances weighted by the sample’s degrees of freedom. The pooled standard error is then calculated as the square root of the pooled variance divided by the square root of the number of samples. Confidence intervals for the null hypothesis are determined by multiplying the pooled standard error to the ζ score corresponding to a given percentage threshold. Mean log inhibitions outside the confidence interval are considered to be inhibitory if positive or stimulatory if negative with the percent confidence corresponding to the interval used. Ternary combinations with mean log inhibition greater than 0.312 are reported as ++++ (> 99% confidence interval (C.l.) of the null hypothesis), those with mean log inhibition between 0.221 and 0. 312 as +++ (95% < C.l. <99%), those with mean log inhibition between 0.171 and 0. 221 as ++ (90% < C.l. <95%), those with mean log inhibition between 0.113 and 0. 171 as + (80% < C.l. <90%), those with mean log inhibition between -0.113 and -0. 171 as - (80% < C.l. <90%), those with mean log inhibition between -0. 171 and -0. 221 as - (90% < C.l. <95%), those with mean log inhibition between -0. 221 and -0. 312 as - (95% < C.l. <99%), and those with mean log inhibition less than -0. 312 as (99% < C.I.).

Non-limiting but exemplary ternary combinations include those with mean log reduction greater than 0.171, e.g. any combination shown in Table 6 with a score of ++++, such as Colinsella aerofaciens, Coprococcus comes, and Blautia producta. Equally important, the CivSim assay describes ternary combinations that do not effectively inhibit C. difficile. 5 of 56 combinations promote growth with >80% confidence; 2 of 56 promote growth with >90% confidence; 1 of 56, Coprococcus comes, Clostridium symbiosum and Eubacterium rectale, promote growth with >95% confidence. 12 of 56 combinations are neutral in the assay, meaning they neither promote nor inhibit C. difficile growth to the limit of measurement. [0405] It is straightforward for one of skill in the art to use the CivSim method to determine efficacious subsets of the Core Ecology derived from the ethanol treated spore fraction shown to be efficacious in treating C. difficile in humans. Example ΑΑΖΑ: Bacterial compositions populating the gut in a mouse model. [0406] Two bacterial compositions were evaluated in a mouse model to demonstrate the ability to populate the gastrointestinal tract. Bacteria were grown as described in ***Example 14. Compositions were pre-made under anaerobic conditions and suspended in PBS + 15% glycerol and stored at > -70°C prior to [0407] Groups of mice (10 females/group; 5 per cage) were pre-treated on Days -14 to -5 with an antibiotic cocktail consisting of 10% glucose, kanamycin (0.5 mg/ml), gentamicin (0.044 mg/ml), colistin (1062.5 U/ml), metronidazole (0.269 mg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.156 mg/ml), ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) and vancomycin (0.056 mg/ml) in their drinking water. On Day -3 they received 10 mg/kg Clindamycin by oral gavage. On Day -1, they were dosed with a microbial compositions by oral gavage in a volume of 0.2 mL (Table ΖΑ). Microbial compositions comprised approximately equal numbers of each OTU and were dosed at approximately 1x109, 1χ108 and 1χ107 per OTU for each composition (e.g. microbial composition 1, comprising 15 strains, was dosed at approximately 1.5x101°, 1.5x109, and 1.5χ108 total CFU). Fecal samples were collected from each cage on Day -1 (approximately 1 hour before dosing) and on Days 2, 3 and 4 post-dosing. Feces were stored frozen prior to processing and sequencing. Weight gain of mice treated with either microbial compositions was similar to that of naive, control mice. [0408] In parallel, groups of animals treated with the same microbial compositions on Day -1 were challenged on Day 0 with approximately 1045 spores of Clostridium difficile (ATCC 43255) via oral gavage. Mortality for C. difficile challenged animals was assessed every day from Day 0 to Day 6 and the weight and subsequent weight change of the animal was assessed with weight loss being associated with C. difficile infection. Mortality and reduced weight loss of the test article compared to the empty vehicle was used to assess the success of the test article. Table ΖΑ.

The OTU assignment of fecal samples from Days -1,2, 3 and 4 was determined by analyzing 16S-V4 sequence reads and assigning OTUs as described in ***Example 11. Clades were assigned as described in ***Example 11. Total read counts were determined for each OTU or each clade by summing the results from cages of the same experimental group. Samples with 10 or fewer sequence reads for a given OTU or clade were considered to be below background and were not included in the summation process.

First, there are a group of OTUssequence reads on-1 that show subsequent and large numbers ofreads on Days 2,or 4; this group includes Cl. butyricum, Cl.Cl. orbiscindens, Cl.and L. bacterium_5_1_57FAA. Cl.is comparable to thisas it has sequence reads on Day -1 that areclose to backgroundand 29 in compositions 1 and 2, respectively),subsequentlyby as much as 1000-fold on Days 2, 3 or 4.are OTUs such asaerofaciens, C. comes, R. bromii, Β. producta, Cl. bolteae, Cl. mayombei, Cl. innocuum, Cl. tedium and R. gnavus which are not detectable at the OTU level in either the Day -1 sample or in subsequent samples. In composition 2, Co. aerofaciens is detected transiently on Day 2 in the 1χ108 and 1x107dose groups; Ε. rectale in the same experimental groups is detected on Day 3, suggesting a possible relationship between transient population by Co. aerofaciens followed by Ε. rectale in these groups of mice. A striking observation is that the observed number of OTU sequence reads is not highly dose dependent. Overall, the data is consistent with a model whereby OTUs populate rapidly following oral administration. [0411] The clade-based analysis in Table TAC was performed to more thoroughly evaluate the population of the Gl tract. Clade-based analysis obscures some of the details afforded by an OTU analysis. For instance, Cl. tedium and Cl. butyricum are members of the same clade and thus a clade-based analysis cannot distinguish the dynamics of these individual OTUs. However, clade-based analysis has the compensatory benefit that it is sensitive to measuring population changes that can be missed by an OTU-based analysis. The ability of 16S-V4 OTU identification to assign an OTU as a specific species depends in part on the resolving power of the 16S-V4 region for a particular species or group of species. Both the density of available reference 16S sequences for different regions of the tree as well as the inherent variability in the 16S gene between different species will determine the definitiveness of a taxonomic annotation. So in some cases, the population of a species can be followed using clade-based assignments when OTU based-detection is insensitive in a complex population. For instance, the clade-based analysis in Table 2Β supports the case that R. bromii, Β. producta, Cl. innocuum, and R. gnavus were able to populate since each OTU is a sole member of a clade in the microbial compositions and sequence reads went from undetectable on Day -1 to well above background on Days 2, 3 or 4. 16S V4 sequencing and clade-based analysis could not determine whether Cl. tertium or Cl. bolteae populated due to the fact that other members of their clades (Cl. butyricum and Cl. symbiosum, respectively) were present and shown to populate at the OTU level in the mice. [0412] In the mice challenged in parallel with C. difficile, animals were significantly protected as shown in Table TAD. Mice gavaged with vehicle (phosphate buffered saline) experienced 100% mortality while microbial compositions 1 and 2 protected at all dose levels with between 0 and 10% mortality by Day 6, the last day of the experiment. In addition, weight loss in animals treated with microbial compositions 1 and 2 was minimal compared to animals receiving the vehicle gavage. These data confirm that population of the gastrointestinal tract with microbial compositions confers a clinical benefit by restoring a state of dysbiosis so that animals can resist infection by a pathogen.

[0413] The emergence and spread of highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria represent a major clinical challenge (Snitkin et al Science Translational Medicine, 2012). In recent years, the numbers of infections caused by organisms such as methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Clostridium difficile have increased markedly, and many of these strains are acquiring resistance to the few remaining active antibiotics. Most infections produced by highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria are acquired during hospitalizations, and preventing patient- topatient transmission of these pathogens is one of the major challenges confronting hospitals and clinics. Most highly antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains belong to genera that colonize mucosal surfaces, usually at low densities. The highly complex microbiota that normally colonizes mucosal surfaces inhibits expansion of and domination by bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae. Destruction of the normal flora by antibiotic administration, however, disinhibition antibiotic-resistant members of these bacterial families, leading to their expansion to very high densities (Ubeda etal Journal of Clinical Investigation 2010). High-density colonization by these organisms can be calamitous for the susceptible patient, resulting in bacteremia and sepsis (Tauret al, Clinical Infectious Disease, 2012). [0414] To test prophylactic use and treatment of a bacterial composition test article e.g. spore population, a VRE infection mouse model is used as previously described (Ubeda et al, Infectious Immunity 2013, Ubeda et al, Journal of clinical investigation, 2010). Briefly, experiments are done with 7-week-old C57BL/6J female mice purchased from Jackson Laboratory, housed with irradiated food, and provided with acidified water. Mice are individually housed to avoid contamination between mice due to coprophagia. For experimental infections with VRE, mice are treated with ampicillin (0.5 g/liter) in their drinking water, which is changed every 3 days. [0415] In the treatment model, on day 1, mice are infected by means of oral gavage with 108 CFU of the vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strain purchased from ATCC (ATCC 700221). One day after infection (day 1), antibiotic treatment is stopped and VRE levels are determined at different time points by plating serial dilutions of fecal pellets on Enterococcosel agar plates (Difco) with vancomycin (8 ug/ml; Sigma). VRE colonies are identified by appearance and confirmed by Gram staining or other methods previously described (e.g. see example 1,2 and 3). In addition, as previously described (Ubeda et al Journal of Clinical Investigation 2010), PCR of the vanA gene, which confers resistance to vancomycin, confirms the presence of VRE in infected mice. The test article e.g. bacterial composition, or ethanol treated, gradient purified spore preparation (as described herein), fecal suspension, or antibiotic treatment is delivered in PBS on days 1-3 while the negative control contains only PBS and is also delivered on days 1-3 by oral gavage. Fresh fecal stool pellets are obtained daily for the duration of the experiment from days -7 to day 10. The samples are immediately frozen and stored at -80°C. DNA was extracted using standard techniques and analyzed with 16S or comparable methods (e.g. see example 2 and 3). [0416] In the colonization model, ampicillin is administered as described above for day -7 to day 1, treatment with the test article or vehicle control is administered on day 0-2 and the VRE resistant bacteria at 108CFU are administered on day 14. Fecal samples are taken throughout the experiment daily from -7 to day 21 and submitted for 16S sequencing as previously described (e.g. see examples 2 and 3). [0417] In both models titers of VRE in feces are used to evaluate the success of the test article versus the negative control. Furthermore, microbiota composition is assessed for the ability of the test article to induce a healthy microbiome. Example 37: Prophylactic use and treatment of a Mouse model of Carbapenem resistant klebsiella (CRKB) colonization [0418] The emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae strains with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems is a significant threat to hospitalized patients. Resistance to carbapenems in these organisms is most frequently mediated by Κ. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), a class A beta-lactamase that also confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and commercially available beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (Queenan et al, Clinical Microbiology Review, 2007). KPC-producing Κ. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) strains often harbor resistance determinants against several other classes of antimicrobials, including aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, resulting in truly multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms (Hirsch et al, Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, 2009). Considering the limited antimicrobial options, infections caused by KPC-Kp pose a tremendous therapeutic challenge and are associated with poor clinical outcomes [0419] A treatment protocol in a mouse model as previously described (e.g. Perez et al, Antimicrobial Agents Chemotherapy, 2011) is used to evaluate the test article e.g. bacterial composition for treating carbapenem resistant Klebsiella and reducing carriage in the Gl tract. Female CF1 mice (Flarlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) are used and are individually housed and weighed between 25 and 30 g. [0420] The thoroughly characterized strain of Κ. pneumoniae, VA-367 (8, 9, 25) is used in this study. This clinical isolate is genetically related to the KPC-Kp strain circulating in the Eastern United States. Characterization of the resistance mechanisms in Κ. pneumoniae VA-367 with PCR and DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of blaKPc-3, blajEM-i, blasHv-n, and blasHv-12 as well as qnrB19 and aac(6’)-lb. Additionally, PCR and DNA sequencing revealed disruptions in the coding sequences of the following outer membrane protein genes: οη∩ρΚ35, οη∩ρΚ36, and οη∩ρΚ37. Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) was performed with the agar dilution method and interpreted according to current recommendations from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). A modified Hodge test was performed, according to a method described previously (e.g. see Anderson et al, Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 2007) with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem. Tigecycline and polymyxin Ε were evaluated by Etest susceptibility assays (ΑΒ bioM’erieux, Solna, Sweden). Results for tigecycline were interpreted as suggested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and according to CLSI recommendations (criteria for Pseudomonas) for polymyxin Ε. [0421] Mice (10 per group) are assigned to either a test article e.g. bacterial composition, ethanol treated, spore preparation (e.g. see example 6), antibiotic clindamycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, tigecycline, ertapenem, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, or combination thereof or control group receiving only the vehicle. They are administered the test article daily from day -10 to day 0, On day 0, 103 CFU of KPC-Κρ VA-367 diluted in 0.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was administered by oral gavage using a stainless-steel feeding tube (Perfektum; Popper & Sons, New Hyde Park, NY). Stool samples were collected 1,4, 6, and 11 days after the administration of KPC-Kp in order to measure the concentration of carbapenem-resistant Κ. pneumoniae. Stool samples (100 mg diluted in 800 ml of PBS) are plated onto MacConkey agar with and without 0.5 ug/ml of imipenem, and the number of CFU per gram of stool was determined. Alternatively other methods may be used to measure the levels of carbapenem-resistant Κ. pneumoniae e.g. per, antigen testing, as one who’s skilled in the art could perform. [0422] Stool samples were collected after 5 days of treatment to assess the effects of the antibiotics on the stool microflora and to measure antibiotic levels in stool. To assess the effects on the microflora, fresh stool samples as previously described (e.g. see examples 2 and 3). Additional experiments are performed to examine whether the administration the test article e.g. bacterial composition resulted in the elimination or persistence of colonization with KPC-Kp VA-367. [0423] Mice are treated with subcutaneous clindamycin to reduce the normal intestinal flora 1 day before receiving 104 CFU of KPC-Kp VA-367 by oral gavage, and the mice continued to receive subcutaneous clindamycin every other day for 7 days. Concurrently, for 7 days after oral gavage with KPC-Kp, mice received oral gavage of normal saline (control group), or the bacterial composition as specified. An additional dose of subcutaneous clindamycin was administered 20 days after the administration of KPC-Kp VA-367 to assess whether low levels of carbapenem-resistant Κ. pneumoniae were present that could be augmented by the elimination of the anaerobic microflora. Stool samples were collected at baseline and at 3, 6, 8, 11, 16, and 21 days after KPC-Kp VA-367 was given by gavage. The bacterial composition will be examined by the reduction of CRKB in feces.

ADDITIONAL TABLES Table 1: List of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) with taxonomic assignments made to Genus, Species, and Phylogenetic Clade [0428] Clade membership of bacterial OTUs is based on 16S sequence data. Clades are defined based on the topology of a phylogenetic tree that is constructed from full-length 16S sequences using maximum likelihood methods familiar to individuals with ordinary skill in the art of phylogenetics. Clades are constructed to ensure that all OTUs in a given clade are: (i) within a specified number of bootstrap supported nodes from one another, and (ii) within 5% genetic similarity. OTUs that are within the same clade can be distinguished as genetically and phylogenetically distinct from OTUs in a different clade based on 16S-V4 sequence data, while OTUs falling within the same clade are closely related. OTUs falling within the same clade are evolutionarily closely related and may or may not be distinguishable from one another using 16S-V4 sequence data. Members of the same clade, due to their evolutionary relatedness, play similar functional roles in a microbial ecology such as that found in the human gut. Compositions substituting one species with another from the same clade are likely to have conserved ecological function and therefore are useful in the present invention. All OTUs are denoted as to their putative capacity to form spores and whether they are a Pathogen or Pathobiont (see Definitions for description of “Pathobiont”). NIAID Priority Pathogens are denoted as ‘Category-A’, ‘Category-B’, or ‘Category-C’, and Opportunistic Pathogens are denoted as ‘OP’. OTUs that are not pathogenic or for which their ability to exist as a pathogen is unknown are denoted as ‘N’. The ‘SEQ ID Number’ denotes the identifier of the OTU in the Sequence Listing File and ‘Public DB Accession’ denotes the identifier of the OTU in a public sequence repository.
