Process O
Zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (1.59 g, 4.36 mmol) was added to a solution of compound 1G (1.5 g, 4.36 mmol) and 3,4-diethoxycyclobutan-3-ene-1,2-dione (2.3 g, 13.06 mmol) in ethanol (20 mL). The mixture was stirred at 23 Â°C for 3 days and then a yellow solid was precipitated, then filtered and the filter cake was washed with ethanol (20 ml) to give compound 130A (yellow solid, 1.02 g, the yield was 50%).
