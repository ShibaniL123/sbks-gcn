Step C: 2-Chloro-3-(difluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium-1-amine,2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate. To a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (13.6 mL, 178 mmol) and water (1.62 mL) was added ethyl O-mesitylsulfonylacetohydroxamate (3.8 g, 13.3 mmol) at −5° C. and the reaction mixture was stirred at −5° C. for 1.5 h. The reaction was quenched with ice water (25 mL). The precipitate was collected and washed with water (20×25 mL). The white solid was dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. To the filtrate was added 2-chloro-3-(difluoromethyl)pyridine (1.45 g, 8.87 mmol) at 0° C. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 72 h. The reaction mixture was slowly diluted with diethyl ether (100 mL). The precipitate was collected and washed with diethyl ether (2×20 mL) to afford the title compound (2.05 g, 5.41 mmol, 61%) as a white crystalline solid.
