Preparation of (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
A solution of sodium nitrite (0.413 g, 5.98 mmol) in water (3.83 mL) was added dropwise over 5 minutes to a stirred solution of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-3,5-dimethyl-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (2.55 g, 5.75 mmol; 83:17 trans:cis) in propionic acid (19.2 mL) maintained at −15° C. using a cooling bath consisting ice, solid sodium chloride, and saturated aqueous sodium chloride. After 20 minutes the reaction was diluted with toluene (100 mL) that had been precooled to −70° C. The resulting light yellow mixture was stirred vigorously, and, after 5 minutes, the cooling bath was removed. Upon reaching room temperature, the red reaction mixture was maintained under these conditions for 1.5 hours and then washed with water (×2). The combined aqueous layers were extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to approximately 20% of the starting volume. This mixture was diluted with EtOAc (20 mL) and washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. Solid potassium carbonate was then added until gas evolution ceased and the mixture tested as being basic using a pH strip. The layers were separated and the organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting oil was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 70% ethyl acetate in hexanes, to afford (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (1.96 g, 75%) as a light orange foam solid and a ˜9:1 trans:cis mixture based on NMR integration.
