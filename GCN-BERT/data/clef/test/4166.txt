Step 2 Synthesis of Compound 24
To a solution of Compound 23 (268 mg, 0.766 mmol) in ethyl acetate (3 mL) were added 2 mol/L sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (1.92 mL, 3.83 mmol) and phenyl chloroformate (0.288 mL, 2.30 mmol), and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. Water was added to the mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate twice. Then, the organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by silicagel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to give Compound 24 (320 mg, Yield 89%).
