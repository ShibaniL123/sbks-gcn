JOINT-SPARING FOOTWEAR, MAINLY SPORTS SHOE OR OTHOPEDIC SHOE The present invention relates to a footwear, mainly to a sports shoe which can preferably be used in sports where it is important to ensure the possibility of turning of the front part of the sole, or to an orthopedic shoe which can advantageously be used for the rehabilitation of patients after surgical operation of their knee joints. Particularly in ball games like basketball, football, tennis or volleyball, there often occure situations during the game where the sportsman wants to turn suddenly on the front part of his sole, which considerably loads his knee or ankle joints. The ligaments of the knee and the ankle then strech and don't allow the joint to turn around the longitudinal axis of the limb. Significant streching forces are exerted on the ligaments particularly when the sole of the sports shoe adheres on the given ground or flooring. This kind of load of the joints of the leg has't been taken into account by the application of traditional sports shoes in said sports. Therefore, nor has the risk of a potential injury been, which derives from the overstreching of the ligaments of the knee and the ankle, which can even break in critical situations. The problem to be solved by the invention is to create a joint-sparing shoe, which eliminates the above-depicted shortcomings of shoes, particularly sports shoes of this kind known in the art and allows the turning of the front part of the sole, therefore the reduction of the turning force, i.e. the torsion load, so decreasing the risk of injuries of the joints of the leg, particularly the occurence of ligament-breaks. In the other basic field of application of the invention, the recovery and rehabilitation of patients, particularly after surgical operation of knee and ankle joints is facilitated by the joint-sparing shoe of the present invention such that even in case of strains which can be regarded as physiological loads, it can protect the subsequent injuries of the recovering organs by means of turning the sole part. There have been attempts to solve this problem, mainly in the field of sports shoes. The Korean document KR20050046708 for example discloses a joint-sparing shoe, particularly sports and training shoe, in which for the promotion of changing the heading at the front and/or rear part of the sole, a sole layer of mainly disk shape is formed which is capable of rotating with respect to the other parts of the sole, and which is connected to the other parts of the sole via a central pin and a roller bearing. This solution has several drawbacks. First of all, the rigid, metal central pin and roller bearing are situated in the very sole region where the load is conveyed, therefore the wearing of such sports shoes - due also to the inelastic elements - is foredoomed to be unconfortable. In addition, nothing prevents the turning of the sole part which is adapted to turn in response to the load, so the freely tu rning sole can lead to the overloading of the hip, and its returning to a stable basic position is not ensured at all. The published international application W094/16588 discloses a shoe, particularly football shoe, which has a lower sole layer capable of a limited turning around a front central hub, the returning of which to the original position is to be ensured by a spring module inserted into the sole part. This solution also has the basic drawback that the sole part conveying the load comprises rigid elements which cause inconvenience, and the turning is not prevented by any component, so the usual wearing of the shoe is not possible. The invention derives from the recognition that the above drawbacks of the above solutions can be overcome if a region is formed in the front part of the sole of the joint-sparing shoe, where the turning of the parts rotatable with respect to each other along a circle is limited and triggered by a sufficient torsion load, at the same time it is well guided, and wherein the stable binding of the parts rotatable with respect to each other as well as their reliable returning pursuant the turning are assured through means which are inserted integrally into the material of the sole and which allow comfortable use. On the basis of the above recognition, starting from a sports shoe comprising of a shoe upper and a shoe sole connected fixedly to the shoe upper, wherein at least in the front part of the shoe a region is formed, in which a lower sole layer of the shoe sole is adapted to rotate along a circle in a guided manner in response to a torsion load, and then to return to its initial position relatively to an adjacent sole layer mounted thereabove, wherein the sole layers are connected to each other by means of at least one binding element providing a stable connection thereof while, at the same time permitting their rotation with respect to each other, the object of the invention achieved by providing sole layers which are capable of rotating with respect to each other in a guided manner, but can rotate only when the torsion load reaches a critical value at which the knee ligaments are jeopardized, which are provided with and fitted with a plurality of concentrically alligned ached ribs and circular grooves, wherein the gap between said two sole layers are filled with an elastically deformable adhesive material, and wherein for the stable connection of the sole layers, for their limited rotation with respect to each other and for their return to their initial positions, binding studs made of a rubber-like elastic material are provided as binding elementssaid binding studs being fixedly and/or integrally connected to both sole layers and arranged equidistantly in one or more circular grooves. By critical torsion load we mean a load which already risks the soundness of the knee ligaments, but is definitely smaller that the force which causes the strain leading to the break of the front crossing ligament of the knee. So up to loads which do not bring about injury-risks, the sole acts similarly as traditional soles. The shoe therefore does not cause any inconvenience for the wearer, but the protection assured by said mechanism is available. Preferably, the sole layers adapted to turn away on each other are provided in the form of discs mounted on each other within a region of the front sole part, which ensures a relatively simple construction. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the sole layer forming the upper disc forms an integral part of the shoe sole, with respect to which the sole layer forming the lower disc is adapted to rotate elastically. On the other hand, it can be advantageous that the sole layer forming the upper disc and the sole layer fixed thereto and forming the lower disc are connected to the shoe sole as a single replaceable unit by means of releasable binding elements. For reliable returning into the state before rotation, an embodiment is preferred where the lower sole layer is additionally connected to at least one elastically deformable pre-stressed anchoring element, one end of which is fixed on the rotatable lower sole layer itself, whereas its other end is fixed outside the lower sole layer at a suitably selected location of the shoe sole. In a preferred version thereof, the lower sole layer is connected to two anchoring elements, which are arranged in the longitudinal central line of the shoe sole on the two opposite sides of the lower sole layer. In another embodiment ensuring a more reliable return, the lower sole layer is connected to more than two anchoring elements in pairs. As a simpler possible embodiment, the anchoring elements are fixed at their ends by their material to the material of the shoe sole or the lower sole layer capable of rotating, respectively, directly or integrally via a securing element. The creasing of the anchoring element under rotation can be eliminated, therefore a better operation can be ensured in the embodiment, where the anchoring elements are hingedly fixed at their ends via pins. The anchoring elements are advantageously arranged in suitably depressed recesses of the shoe sole such that they are connected to an upper level of the lower sole layer, but contrary to the lower sole layer, these anchoring elements are not in contact with the ground. The anchoring elements are also made from a rubber-like elastic material capable of elastic deformation, which material is optionally identical with the material of the shoe sole or some layer thereof. will now be further described with reference to the following embodiments in which illustrates the side view of the joint-sparing, sports or orthopedic shoe of the present invention, with a sole shown in a partly sectional view, is the bottom view of the joint-sparing, sports or orthopedic shoe of Figure 1 with the lower sole layer removed, illustrates the enlarged sectional view of the front sole of the joint-sparing, sports or orthopedic shoe of Figure 1 in a rest state, depicts the enlarged sectional view of the front sole of the joint-sparing, sports or orthopedic shoe of Figure 1 in a braked, loaded state, schematically shows the forces acting on the sole of the joint-sparing, sports or orthopedic shoe of Figure 1, is the schematic side view of another embodiment of the joint-sparing, sports or orthopedic shoe of the present invention, wherein the lower sole layer is connected to two elastic anchoring elements facilitating the return into the initial state, is the schematic bottom view of the joint-sparing, sports or orthopedic shoe of Figure 4, shows an embodiment of the joint-sparing, sports or orthopedic shoe of Figure 4, wherein the lower sole layer is connected to more than two elastic anchoring elements facilitating the return into the initial state, is the schematic bottom view of the joint-sparing, sports or orthopedic shoe of Figure 6, Figure 8 illustrates another embodiment of the joint-sparing, sports or orthopedic shoe of Figure 4, wherein the lower sole layer is connected to two elastic anchoring elements facilitating the return into the initial state, adapted to rotate hingedly, Figure 9 is the schematic bottom view of the joint-sparing, sports or orthopedic shoe of Figure 8, Figure 1 shows the side view of the joint-sparing sports and orthopedic shoe 1 of the present invention, which consists of a shoe upper 2 and a sole part 3 bound fixedly thereto and showed partly in a sectional view. As can be seen in this figure, in the front part of the sole 3, a region is formed in which a lower sole layer 5 in case of a torsion load of a critical value jeopardising the ligaments of the knee is adapted to rotate along a circle in a guided manner and to return with respect to an upper sole layer 4 situated thereon and fitted thereto. The upper sole layer 4 can be formed as an integral part of sole 3and can be formed as an independent disc-shaped element coincident with lower sole layer 5 as well, so sole layers 4 and 5 can optionally form an independently mountable and replaceable unit in the sole 3. The stable binding of sole layers 4 and 5 with each other, at the same time their limited rotation with respect to each other as well as their returning into their original positions can be assured by binding elements which are formed as binding studs 6 made of a rubber-like elastic material essentially connected fixedly and/or integrally to the two sole layers 4 and 5. These binding studs 6, due to their material, can follow the turning of the lower sole layer 5 effected by a torsion load elastically expanding, and when this load is over their elastic deformation urges the return of the initial state, meanwhile they bind the two sole layers 4 and 5 together. In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, the two sole layers 4 and 5 rotatable on each other are created in the form of discs positioned on each other, the facing surfaces of which are provided with concentric arched ribs 7, 7' and circular grooves 8, 8', fitting into each other, which are intended to ensure the stable guiding of the two sole layers 4 and 5 with respect to each other along a circle during their arcuate turning of limited extent. The gaps between the ribs 7, 7' and circular grooves 8, 8' are filled with an elastically deformable adhesive material 9, which beside the binding studs 6, also promotes stable binding between the sole layers 4 and 5, at the same time permits limited elastic rotation thereof with respect to each other. In addition, an essential advantage of the adhesive material 9 is that it hinders dust and contamination from penetrating between the sole layers 4 and 5. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1, the upper sole layer 4 forms an integral part of sole 3, with respect to which the disc forming the lower sole layer 5 can rotate elastically, then as the torsion load has ceased, by the influence of the binding studs 6 forming the binding element and partly of the adhesive material 9, it returns to its initial position. The rubber-like elastic binding studs 6 are arranged in one or more circular grooves 8, 8', preferably equidistantly along the circumference. The 7, 7' ribs are extending either only fractionally or to no extent into the respective circular grooves 8, 8' receiving the binding studs 6. Figure 2 illustrates bottom view of the sports and ortopedic shoe 1 shown in Figure 1, wherein sole layer 5 contacting the floor and adapted to rotate is removed. Accordingly, the circularly running ribs 7 and circular grooves 8 of the sole layer 4 of the sole 3, and the adhesive material 9 filled in the circular grooves 8 in between the ribs 7 as well as the binding studs 6 arranged equidistantly in the two outer circular grooves 8 can be clearly seen. Figure 3a depicts the sectional view of the front sole part of the joint-sparing sports and ortopedic shoe of Figure 1 enlarged in a rest state. This figure shows particularly clearly how the ribs 7 and circular grooves 8 of sole layer 4 and also the ribs 7' and circular grooves 8' of sole layer 5 fit into each other perpendicularly, and that the arched ribs 7, 7' of the two discs forming sole layers 4 and 5 protrude deeply into the couterside gaps formed by the circular grooves 8, 8'. Furthermore it can also be seen how the adhesive material 9, which ensures the elastic binding and limited rotation, fills the gaps between said elements. The effect of this constructional layout is twofold, as illustrated in the following figures. Figure 3b shows the state when the sportsman brakes during running or reaches the ground after jumping. In this case the arched ribs 7, 7' strain against each other and the two sole layers 4, 5 formed by the discs together correspond to a motionless sole as in the case of a traditional shoe. The binding elements between the sole layers 4, 5, i.e. the elastic binding studs 6, and the elastically deformable adhesive material 9 act mitigatingly: the annular ribs 7 of sole layer 4 press the adhesive material 9 with force Fl, while similarly to binding studs 6 they move towards the annular ribs 7' of sole layer 5. The tensile force F2 between the upper ribs 7 and the lower ribs 7' also diminishes the force F3 exerted in the direction of the movement, so the sole elastically absorbs the braking force F4. The gravitational force F5 and the counter-pressing force F6 of the ground don't cause any substantial movement in the sole, they can at most be perceived as elasticity. Figure 3c shows in a scematic bottom view that if a turning force F7 arises at the end of the leg then the binding elements 6 between the two sole layers 4, 5, as well as adhesive material 9 allow the rotation of the disc forming the lower sole layer 5 around its center 10, which allows displacements 12 and 13 towards both directions with respect to the initial position of heel 11. If, for example, some sampled elements from the usual motion of a basketball player are observed when he is running, stops with reaching the ground, then throws the ball while jumping up, it can be seen that it's not only the ball that advances from the ground to the basket, but the sportman is also rising. Jumping not only means an upwards motion, but often involves a rotation around the axis of the body. The energy needed for this motion is mostly provided by jumping away from the ground. If the load of the lower body parts are considered in a more precise manner, it can be seen that in the moment of the jumping, the hip can follow not only the rising, but also the turning of the upper body, due to its anatomic construction. The knee and the ankle are capable of streching and flexing, they, however, can bear circular loads only passively, i.e. till the limit of the loadability of the ligaments, as these joints have not been evolved against loads of this direction. The human body tries to neutralize the loads of this kind, which also occur during natural motions, by displacing the bones of the leg to some extent, the relatively frequent sports injuries, however, show that this isn't sufficient in each case. A traditional sports shoe (which is not turn-supporting) which is in close connection with the ground, doesn't make the reduction of the rotational movement deriving from the hip possible, so it turns up as tense in the joints of the knee and the ankle. Since this time (i.e. at jumping) not only the gravitational force of the body urges the sole to the ground, but it is enhanced by the jumping away, so the well-adhering sole risks the safety of the ligaments of the joints. The advantages of the joint-sparing sports shoe of the present invention can be recognized through this kind of motions the most: if the turning force F7 appears at the front part of the sole (the springing away takes place from this point, so derives the force from here too), the heel 11 can move with a 12 or 13 displacement. Its health-significancy comes from the fact that the turning, torsion movement of the hip also implies a movement on the sole, so the overloading of the knee and the ankle - exposed to twisting - can be avoided. Since the connection between the two sole layers 4 and 5 formed as discs is elastic, as the sportsman rises from the ground, the lower sole layer 5 returns to its initial position. In order that the lower sole layer 5 (which is adapted to turn) of the joint-sparing sports or ortopedic shoe of the present invention can return to its initial position more safely after the turning in response to the torsion load, additionally at least one elastically deformable, pre- stressed 14 anchoring element is connected to this lower sole layer 5, wherein one end of the anchoring element is fixed on the lower sole layer 5 itself, while the other end is fixed outside the lower sole layer 5, on a suitably selected location of the sole 3. Figures 4 and 5 show the schematic side and bottom view of an embodiment of the joint- sparing sports or ortopedic shoe of the present invention, respectively, where the lower sole layer 5 is connected to two elastic anchoring elements 14 facilitating the return to the initial position, which are arranged in the longitudinal central line of the sole 3, on the two opposit sides of the lower sole layer 5. As a possible version of this embodiment, Figure 6 and 7 show a sports and ortopedic shoe, in which the lower sole layer 5 is connected to more than two anchoring elements, preferably in pairs, e.g. beside the anchoring elements 14 extending in the longitudinal direction of the sole 3, anchoring elements 16 obliquely stressed in a lateral direction are also available which further enhance the efficiency of the lower sole layer 5. In the above-mentioned embodiments the anchoring elements 14, 16 are secured at their ends with their material to the material of the sole 3 or of the lower sole layer 5 adapted to turn, respectively; either directly or integrally via a securing element 15. Figures 8 and 9 illustrate a schematic side and bottom view of a further embodiment of the joint-sparing sports or ortopedic shoe of the present invention, repsectively, wherein similarly to Figures 4 and 5, the lower sole layer 5 is connected to two elastic anchoring elements 14 urging the return to the initial position, which in case of torsion load are capable of a hinged rotation so that the ends of the anchoring elements 14 are secured via 17 pins made even of metal material to the lower sole layer 5 or the sole 3, respectively. Certainly, this hinged version can be realized with more than two anchoring elements 14, 16, too, similarly to the arrangement of Figures 6 and 7. It should be noted that for the sake of better overview, the joint-sparing shoe of the present invention is illustrated only schematically in Figures 4-9, especially its rotation-permitting sole part, the more detailed construction of which - apart from the anchoring elements - is identical with the construction shown in Figures 1 and 2. 1.
