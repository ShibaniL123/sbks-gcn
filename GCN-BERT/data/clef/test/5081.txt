Step F: 6-(Difluoromethyl)-8-ethyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. To a solution of 8-ethyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-6-carbaldehyde (72 mg, 0.296 mmol) in DCM (5.9 mL) at 0° C. under an Na atmosphere was added diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (0.23 mL, 1.78 mmol) dropwise via syringe. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h and then poured over ice (ca. 10 mL), diluted with sat. aq. NaHCO3, and extracted with CH2Cl2 (2×). The combined organics were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound (69 mg, 88%).
