BACKGROUND Sheet-like substrates for administration of oral treatments have been known for some time. A variety of advantages are achieved with such substrates, such as ease of handling, storage and packaging. One disadvantage of such substrates is that the application of the oral treatment is generally limited to the tooth surface, and does not infiltrate the areas between the teeth. EP-A-1391212, upon which the two-part form of claim 1 is based, discloses oral preparations and supports for oral preparations. SUMMARY The present invention provides a dental strip according to claim 1 that includes a film backing, an adhesive layer on one surface of the film backing, the adhesive layer including a water-swellable polymer and at least one active agent, wherein the film backing is detachable from the adhesive layer. Preferred features are defined in the dependent claims. Also described herein is a method of delivering an active agent to spaces between teeth in an oral cavity that includes applying a dental strip to teeth in which the dental strip includes a film backing, and an adhesive layer on one surface of the film backing, the adhesive layer including a water-swellable polymer and at least one active agent, wherein the film backing is detachable from the adhesive layer, solubilizing the adhesive layer by saliva present in the oral cavity, wherein the adhesive layer expands and infiltrates the spaces between the teeth thereby delivering the active agent. Also described herein is a method of removing a substance from spaces between the teeth that includes applying a dental strip to teeth in which the dental strip includes a film backing, and an adhesive layer on one surface of the film backing, the adhesive layer including a water-swellable polymer and at least one active agent, wherein the film backing is detachable from the adhesive layer, solubilizing the adhesive layer by saliva present in the oral cavity, wherein the adhesive layer expands and infiltrates the spaces between the teeth, and removing the dental strip from the teeth.

Some embodiments relate to a removable dental strip for administration of an oral treatment. The dental strip comprises at least two layers, including a film backing and an adhesive layer on one surface of the film backing. The adhesive layer comprises a water-swellable polymer and at least one active agent, wherein the film backing is detachable from the adhesive layer. In some embodiments, the dental strips may be applied to teeth to administer an oral treatment such as delivering an active agent to spaces between the teeth and/or removing substances from areas between teeth. In some embodiments, the film backing comprises a non-toxic material. Examples of suitable non-toxic substrates include, but are not limited to, textiles, cloth, wood composite, resin, elastomer, and paper. Suitable materials useful as a film backing in the embodiments are discussed in U.S. Patent App. 2002/0187112. Other materials suitable for film backing includes cellulose derivatives such as ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate, polyvinyl chloride, wax, Parafilms™, polyethylene, polyvinyl alcohol, Teflon™ and their derivatives. In some embodiments, the film backing includes one or more ethylene oxide polymers. Ethylene oxide polymers useful for a film backing may include homopolymers. Ethylene oxide polymers useful for a film backing may also include mixtures of ethylene oxide polymers of varying molecular weight of 10,000 Daltons to 10,000,000 Daltons. In some embodiments ethylene oxide polymers useful for a film backing include mixtures of ethylene oxide polymers of varying average molecular weight of 100,000 to 1,500,000 Daltons. Such ethylene oxide polymers are commercially available from various sources. Poly(ethylene) oxide polymers having an average molecular weight range of 10,000 to 1,000,000 Daltons are available from the Dow Chemical Company under the tradename "Polyox." Suitable Polyox materials useful in forming the film backing are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,419,906, 6,503,486, 6,514,483. In some embodiments, a film backing further includes one or more plasticizers. Examples of plasticizers useful for incorporation in a film backing include, but are not limited to, glycols such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyhydric alcohols such as glycerin and sorbitol and glycerol esters such as glycerol triacetate. In some embodiments, the plasticizer is present at about 1 to about 30% by weight of the film. In other embodiments, the plasticizer is present at about 3 to about 20% by weight. The ethylene oxide polymer film of the present invention may be prepared using conventional extrusion or solvent casting processes. For example, to prepare a film by solvent casting poly(ethylene) oxide, the ethylene oxide polymer or mixture of polymers may be dissolved in a sufficient amount of a solvent that is compatible with the polymer. In some embodiments, examples of suitable solvents include but are not limited to water, alcohols, acetone, ethyl acetate or mixtures thereof. In embodiments that optionally include a plasticizer, after a solution of the polymer has been formed, a plasticizer is added with stirring, and heat is applied if necessary to aid dissolution until a clear and homogeneous solution of polymer and plasticizer has been formed. The solution may be coated onto a suitable carrier material and dried to form a film. In some embodiments, the carrier material has a surface tension that allows the polymer solution to spread evenly across the intended carrier width without soaking in to form a destructive bond between the two substrates. Examples of suitable carrier materials include glass, stainless steel, teflon, polyethylene-impregnated kraft paper, and the like. In some embodiments, the film is dried. In some embodiments, the film is coated with an adhesive layer. In some embodiments the film is cut into pieces of suitable size and shape. In some embodiments, the film backing has a thickness of 20 to 1500 µm, preferably a thickness of 30 to 1000µm. The film backing has a length of about 2 to about 20 cm, preferably a length of about 4 to about 14 cm. The film backing has a width of about 1 to about 6 cm, preferably a length of about 2 to about 4 cm. An adhesive layer is applied to one surface of the film backing. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer is coated onto the film backing. In some embodiments the adhesive layer is hydratable. The adhesive layer includes a water-swellable polymer and at least one active agent. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer may exhibit tackiness, or an adhesive quality, prior to coming in contact with water or saliva. In other embodiments, the adhesive layer exhibits increased tackiness or adhesive quality upon coming in contact with water or saliva. The adhesive layer includes a water-swellable polymer and at least one active agent. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer includes suitable additives such as flavorants, colorants, and/or preservatives. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer includes or has a substantial portion of swelling agents. Suitable swelling agents include, for example, those known as absorbent polymers in sanitary products, such as diapers, panty liners, in feminine hygiene, and the like, and are known as superabsorbent polymers. Such swellable substances absorb aqueous liquids and spontaneously combine with them to form a relatively stable gel. They are capable of absorbing and permanently retaining many times their weight of aqueous liquids. The resultant gel has chain-like molecules linked into a three-dimensional network and embedded in a liquid medium. Examples of water-swellable polymer useful for an adhesive layer are described in U.S. Patent 6,153,222. In some embodiments, the water-swellable polymer includes a hydrogel. In some embodiments, the hydrogel includes cross-linked carboxyvinyl copolymers and/or cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidones. Other materials suitable for the adhesive layers include polyethylene oxide (also known as Polyox), carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, polyacrylic acid and its derivatives, Carbopol, polyvinyl alcohol and alginate. The weight of the adhesive materials can range from about 1mg to 20 gm, preferably from about 20 mg to 5 gm. In some embodiments, the water-swellable polymer expands on contact with water or saliva and assumes several times its original volume. In some embodiments, the polymer includes substances that are effervescent on contact with water or saliva. Such substances may be sodium bicarbonate, and citric or ascorbic acid, or other physiologically acceptable acids. If these foams are used, rapid disintegration of the adhesive layer, which is desirable in some cases, may selectively be further accelerated by the developing increase in volume of the water-swellable polymer. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer and/or water-swellable polymer that may be incorporated into the adhesive layer is impregnated with one or more active agents. In other embodiments, the adhesive layer and/or water-swellable polymer is coated with one or more active agents. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer may include one or more active agents that prevent, treat and/or reduce the symptoms related to various oral or systemic diseases or conditions. Useful active agents include all those known or developed in the art including steroids, NSAIDs, a fluoride ion source, polycarboxylate polymers, polyvinyl methyl ether/maleic anhydride (PVME/MA) copolymers, an arginine ester, a zinc ion source, (e.g., zinc citrate, zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, and the like), a stannous ion source, delmopinol, tartar control agents, an antibacterial agent, triclosan and salts thereof, chlorhexidine, alexidine, hexetidine, sanguinarine, benzalkonium chloride, salicylanilide, domiphen bromide, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), tetradecylpyridinium chloride (TPC), N-tetradecyl-4-ethylpyridinium chloride (TDEPC), octenidine, octapinol, nisin, a copper ion source, an essential oil, a furanone, antiinflammatory agents, anti-plaque agents, antioxidants, and bacteriocins, and salts thereof, honokiol, vitamins, anti-attachment agents, proteinaceous agents, peptides, and the like. Active agents may include plaque-reducing agents, such as enzymes and non-enzyme proteins. Examples of plaque-reducing enzymes include papain, krillase, and glucoamylase. Examples of plaque-reducing non-enzyme proteins include milk protein. In some embodiments, the active agent includes silica. The film backing is detachable from the adhesive layer. In some embodiments, the film backing may be detachable from the adhesive layer before, during, or after the administration of an oral treatment. In some embodiments, the film backing is detachable from the adhesive layer upon application of pressure to the film backing. For example, pressure may be applied to the film backing by one's fingers when the dental strip is applied to the teeth. In some embodiments, the dental strip may be applied to the teeth for administration of an oral treatment. In some embodiments, the oral treatment involves delivery of an active agent to the teeth and to the spaces between the teeth. In some embodiments, the active agent inhibits bacterial growth in the interdental space. In some embodiments, the oral treatment involves removal of substances from the teeth and the spaces between the teeth. The dental strips may be applied to the teeth for administration of an oral treatment. In some embodiments, the oral treatment involves delivery of an active agent to the teeth and to the spaces between the teeth. In some embodiments, the oral treatment involves removal of substances from the teeth and the spaces between the teeth. Figure 1 shows dental strip 10 and teeth 12 before application of dental strip 10 to teeth 12. Dental strip 10 may be applied to teeth 12 with the adhesive layer between teeth 12 and the film backing, as shown in Figure 2. In some embodiments, pressure may be applied to push dental strip 10 against teeth 12. In some embodiments, pressure applied to dental strip 10 may cause the adhesive layer to infiltrate the spaces between teeth 12. In some embodiments, such pressure may detach the film backing from all or part of the adhesive layer. In some embodiments, saliva present in the oral cavity solubilizes the adhesive layer. Upon contact with the saliva, the adhesive layer, which optionally includes a water-swellable polymer, may expand. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer will expand and infiltrate the spaces between teeth 12. In some embodiments, active agents are delivered to the spaces between teeth 12 from the adhesive layer. In some embodiments, the film backing detaches from all or part of the adhesive layer upon expansion of the adhesive layer. In some embodiments, the active agent removes substances from teeth 12 and the spaces between teeth 12. Such substances may include, for example, plaque, bacteria, or food particles. In some embodiments, the active agent dissolves the substance. In some embodiments, the active agent loosens the substance. In some embodiments, the active agent attaches to the substance and reduces its adherence to the teeth and surrounding tissue. In this embodiment, the substance (and active agent attached thereto), can then be removed by, for example, rinsing or brushing. Dental strip 10 may be left on teeth 12 for an amount of time necessary to achieve the intended results of the oral treatment. As shown in Figure 3, dental strip 10 may then be removed from teeth 12. In some embodiments, the film backing and the adhesive layer remain attached to each other upon removal of dental strip 10. The substances may be removed from teeth 12 and the spaces between teeth 12 upon removal of dental strip 10. In some embodiments, the film backing may be detached from all or part of the adhesive layer upon attachment of the adhesive layer to teeth 12. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer remains on teeth 12 and in the spaces between teeth 12 after removal of the film backing. The active agent may continue to remove substances from teeth 12 and the spaces between teeth 12 after the film backing is removed. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer and optional water-swellable polymer(s) and active agent(s) and any substances that may be adhered to the adhesive material of the adhesive layer may be removed from teeth 12 and the spaces between teeth 12 by mechanical abrasion upon removal of the film backing.
