RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) to U.S. provisional application: U.S. Ser. No. 61/474,535, filed Apr. 12, 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS This invention was made with government support under GM088237 awarded by National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to compounds, composition and methods of fluorinating an organic compound using a fluorinating agent. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Functionalized aryl fluorides are used as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, in part due to their favorable pharmacological properties such as increased metabolic stability (see, for example, Müller et al., Science 2007, 317, 1881-1886; Kirk et al., Org. Process Res. Dev. 2001, 41, 443-470; and Jeschke, P. ChemBioChem 2004, 5, 570-589). Aryl fluorides also find applications as tracers in positron emission tomography using the [18F] isotope (Lasne, et al. In Contrast Agents II, 2002; Vol. 222, pp 201-258). Fluorine has the highest electronegativity, the highest oxidation potential, and the smallest anionic radius of all elements, each of which complicates carbon-fluorine bond formation when compared to other carbon-heteroatom bond formations (see, for example, Chambers, R. D., Fluorine in organic chemistry. Oxford: New York, 2004; and Furuya et al. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2008, 11, 803-819).

In some embodiments, the organic compound is further substituted with one or more functional groups (e.g., alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, alkenes, alkoxy groups, cyano groups, amines, amides and N-oxides). In some embodiments, the functional groups are unprotected. In some embodiments, the organic compound is a precursor of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. Fluorine Sources The methods described herein generally include a fluorine source. In some embodiments, the fluorine source is a nucleophilic fluorine source. In some embodiments, the fluorine source is commercially available. In some embodiments, the fluorine source is also an inorganic fluorine source. Exemplary fluorine sources include cesium fluoride (CsF) and potassium fluoride (KF). The fluorine source may be enriched with a particular isotope of fluorine. In some embodiments, the fluorine source is labeled with 19F (i.e., provides a 19F fluorine to the reaction mixture). In some embodiments, reaction of the 19F-labeled fluorine source with a compound within the reaction mixture ultimately provides a fluorinated 19F-labeled organic compound. In some embodiments, the fluorine source is labeled with 18F (i.e., provides a 18F fluorine to the reaction mixture). In some embodiments, reaction of the 18F-labeled fluorine source with a compound in the reaction mixture provides a fluorinated 18F-labeled organic compound. However, in some embodiments, the fluorine source is labeled with a mixture of 18F and 19F. In some embodiments, reaction of the mixture of 19F and 18F fluorine source with a compound in the reaction mixture provides a mixture of fluorinated 19F-labeled organic compound and fluorinated 18F-labeled organic compound. Reaction Conditions Described herein are methods of producing a fluorinating reagent and methods of fluorinating hydroxy organic compounds (e.g., a phenol) or tautomers thereof (e.g., pyridine) using a fluorinating agent (e.g., a compound of formula (I)). In some embodiments, the reaction further comprises a solvent. Exemplary solvents include non-polar solvents (e.g., toluene, dioxane or benzene). In some embodiments, the reaction is performed under ambient temperature, pressure and atmosphere. In some embodiments, the reaction is performed in an inert atmosphere (e.g., an atmosphere that is substantially free of dioxygen or water). In some embodiments, the reaction is performed under anhydrous conditions (e.g., in a solvent that is substantially free of water). In some embodiments, the reaction is heated. In some embodiments, the reaction is cooled. In some embodiments, the reaction is performed at room temperature (e.g., about 20-25° C.). In some embodiments, the reaction proceeds in a single step. In a one-step procedure, an organic compound comprising a substrate and a fluorine source, and optionally an additional reagent such as a base (e.g., NaOH, KOH, BaO, MgO, NaHCO3, KHCO3, Na2CO3, Ba(OH)2 or 2,6-lutidine) or a salt (e.g., cesium fluoride), to yield a fluorinated organic compound. In some embodiments, the additional reagent is a zinc reagent (e.g., diphenyl zinc). In some embodiments, the reaction proceeds in two steps. In a two-step procedure, the organic compound comprising substrate may be first reacted with a compound described herein in the presence of an optional additional reagent, such as a base (e.g., NaOH, KOH, BaO, MgO, NaHCO3, KHCO3, Na2CO3, Ba(OH)2 or 2,6-lutidine). In some embodiments, an intermediate product is isolated from the first reaction. An intermediate product may be further reacted with a fluorinating agent in the second step. In some embodiments, each step further comprises a solvent, and the solvents may be the same or may be different. For example, the first step may take place in acetonitrile, while the second step may take place in acetone. In some embodiments, each step may be performed at a different temperature. For example, the first step may further comprise cooling (e.g., to 0° C.), while the second step may proceed at ambient temperature. In some embodiments, a compound of the present invention or a compound of the methods described herein is immobilized on a solid support. The term “solid support” refers a material to which a compound is attached to facilitate identification, isolation, purification, or chemical reaction selectivity of the compound. Such materials are known in the art and include, for example, beads, pellets, disks, fibers, gels, or particles such as cellulose beads, pore-glass beads, silica gels, polystyrene beads optionally cross-linked with divinylbenzene and optionally grafted with polyethylene glycol, poly-acrylamide beads, latex beads, dimethylacrylamide beads optionally cross-linked with N,N′-bis-acryloyl ethylene diamine, glass particles coated with hydrophobic polymer, and material having a rigid or semi-rigid surface. The solid supports optionally have functional groups such as amino, hydroxy, carboxy, or halo groups, (see, Obrecht, D. and Villalgrodo, J. M., Solid-Supported Combinatorial and Parallel Synthesis of Small-Molecular-Weight Compound Libraries, Pergamon-Elsevier Science Limited (1998)), and include those useful in techniques such as the “split and pool” or “parallel” synthesis techniques, solid-phase and solution-phase techniques, and encoding techniques (see, for example, Czarnik, A. W., Curr. Opin. Chem. Bio., (1997) 1, 60). In some embodiments, the fluorination takes place at a late stage in the synthesis of the fluorinated organic compound. In some embodiments, the fluorination is the last step in the synthesis of the fluorinated organic compound. In some embodiments, subsequent to the reaction, one or more components of the reaction mixture (e.g., a fluorinated organic compound) are purified from the reaction mixture. In some embodiments, the fluorinated organic compound is purified by column chromatography on silica gel. In some embodiments, the fluorinated organic compound is purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography. Reaction Products Described herein are methods of making fluorinated organic compounds.

The reaction conditions described herein are tolerant of many functional groups as well as chiral centers. In some embodiments, the fluorinated organic compound is further substituted by one or more functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, esters, alkenes, alkoxy groups, cyano groups, amines, amides and N-oxides. In some embodiments, the fluorinated organic compound contains a chiral center that is derived from the starting material. The stereochemistry at the chiral center may remain substantially unchanged (e.g., little to no racemization or epimerization of the chiral center occurs during the reaction). In some embodiments, the fluorinated organic compound comprises 19F. In some embodiments, the 19F-containing fluorinated organic compound is an imaging agent, such as an MRI imaging agents. In some embodiments, the 19F-containing fluorinated organic compound may be used as a probe, such as a biological NMR probes for use in in vivo NMR spectroscopy. In some embodiments, the fluorinated organic compound comprises 18F. In some embodiments, the 18F-containing fluorinated organic compound is an imaging agent, such as a PET imaging agent.
