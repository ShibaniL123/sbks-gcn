This application is the U.S. national phase of International Application No. PCT/EP2011/056420 filed 21 Apr. 2011 which designated the U.S. and claims priority to CH 607/10 filed 26 Apr. 2010, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The present patent application relates to a novel coating system, wherein the coating comprises at least one lipid compound and at least one film forming compound and at least one plasticizer and/or at least one emulsifier, characterised in that the lipid compound has a mass median diameter (MMD) of less than 1 μm. Furthermore it relates to compositions coated with such a coating system and the use of such compositions in the production of food, feed, dietary supplements and/or pharmaceutical products. The goal of the present invention was to find a coating system, which improves stability of the active ingredient(s), which are coated by such a coating system. Surprisingly, it was found out that by using a coating system comprising (i) at least one lipid compound and(ii) at least one film forming compound and/or at least one emulsifier and(iii) at least one plasticizer, characterised in that the mass median diameter of the lipid is less than 1 μm, improved coated compositions are obtained. The compositions coated by a coating system according to the present invention are improved in regard to (a) storage stability;(b) sensory (smell and odour); (this is crucial when a strong tasting active ingredient is used);(c) control release of the active ingredient.

The mass median diameter (MMD) given in the present patent application are always measured by using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000. It is to be said that all particle sizes given in this patent application are average particles sizes. Monodispersity of the particles is not an essential criterion of the present invention. The MMD of the lipid compound used in the coating of the composition according to the invention is less than 1 μm. Preferably, the MMD is below 0.95 μm, more preferably below 0.8 μm. Preferred lipid compounds according to the present invention are saturated fatty acids as well as salts thereof, more preferred stearic acid or palmitic acid, as well as their salts. It is clear that one single lipid compound can be used as well as mixtures of two and more lipid compounds. Preferred film forming compounds according to the present invention are hydrocolloids.

The invention is illustrated by the following Example. All temperatures are given in ° C. and all parts and percentages are related to the weight. EXAMPLE 1 Step 1: Coating Formulation 450 g of deionised water are heated up to 80° C. 33.5 g Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) type methocel E19 are added and left at 80° C. for about 1 hour. The solution is then left overnight at room temperature for degassing. 6.5 g Polyethyleneglycol (PEG 400) are then added. 10 g of stearic acid are then predisperse in the HPMC/PEG solution. The micronisation of the stearic acid is then ensured by a dissolver disk type (ESCO-Labor, 1.5 Liter vessel, 60 mm diameter disk). In order to get a good micronisation of the stearic acid, it is necessary to be above the melting temperature (70-80° C.), and to put enough energy in the system (2000-4000 rpm). The cooling of the suspension must be quick (within a couple of minutes) and under strong agitation to avoid re-agglomeration of the stearic acid. 40 g of deionised water are then added to 210 g of the suspension to adjust the viscosity to about 400 mPa·s. The MMD of stearic acid in the suspension are measured with a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 at d3.2=0.26 μm, d10=0.15 μm, d50=0.30 μm, d90=0.59 μm. Step 2: Application of the Coating Formulation on the Core Surface 80 g of a beadlet Vitamin A form (type Dry Vitamin A acetate 325 CWS/S) is fluidised in a small laboratory fluid bed equipment (DMR, WFP mini) and used as Core particles. 241 g of the coating formulation obtained in the step 1 is sprayed on the surface of the beadlets with a 2-fluid nozzle (air pressure: 2 bar) in a bottom-spray configuration. The spraying time is of about 3 hours with an inlet air temperature of 60° C. The final composition of the product obtained is: TABLE 1 Compound of Example 1 Ingredients Wt-% Dry Vitamin A acetate 325 CWS/S 80 HPMC 13.4 PEG 400 2.6 Stearic acid 4 EXAMPLE 2 In analogy to Example 1, a composition instead of using vitamin A acetate fish oil is used. Step 1: Same Coating Formulation as in Example 1 Step 2: Application of the Coating Formulation on the Core Surface 85 g of a beadlet ROPUFA® ‘10’ n-3 INF Powder is fluidised in a small laboratory fluid bed equipment (DMR, WFP mini) and used as Core particles. 181 g of the coating formulation obtained in the step 1 is sprayed on the surface of the beadlets with a 2-fluid nozzle (air pressure: 2.5 bars) in a bottom-spray configuration. The spraying time is of about 2.5 hours with an inlet air temperature of 60° C. The final composition of the product obtained is: The composition of the obtained product is then the following: TABLE 2 Compound of Example 2 Ingredients Wt-% ROPUFA ® ‘10’ n-3 INF Powder 85 HPMC 10.1 PEG 600 1.9 Stearic acid 3 Stability Test of the Coatings Coating Water Permeability Coatings were formed by spreading the solution on a glass plate with a manual handcoater CAMAG. The liquid coating was then dried in a ventilated oven at 40° C. during 24 hours. The test facilities permit to create two atmospheres with different water humidity thanks to silicagel (RH=0) in a sealed bowl and sodium hydroxide (RH=0.75) in the closed environment around the bowl (FIG. 1). The gradient created generates a diffusion of the water through the coating. Bowl weight measured as function of the time (water uptake) gives the flux of water vapour through the film. The water vapour permeability (WVP) is defined as: W ⁢ ⁢ V ⁢ ⁢ P = Δ ⁢ ⁢ m · δ A · Δ ⁢ ⁢ P · Δ ⁢ ⁢ t unit ⁢ : ⁢ ⁢ g · mm ⁢ / ⁢ ( day · m 2 · kPa ) Where Δm (g) is the mass of water retains is the bowl during Δt (day), 6 the thickness of the coating (mm), A the surface of exchange (m2) and ΔP the difference of partial pressure of water (kPa) once the steady state has been reached. The lower the WVP, the better is the coating to protect the active against humidity. The composition of coatings is the same as in Example 1 and 2. Coating 1 comprises stearic acid, which has a MMD of 10 to 20 μm (Comparative example) and Coating 2 comprises stearic acid with a MMD of less than 1 μm (Invention).
