TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a novel phenyl-isoxazol derivative having antiviral activity against an influenza virus and other similar viruses, which is useful in treatment and prevention of virus infection. Also, the present invention relates to a method using a compound for treating or preventing infection of an influenza virus and other similar viruses, a composition including the compound, a preparation method of the compound, and a synthesis intermediate used for the preparation method. BACKGROUND ART An influenza virus causes infectious acute febrile respiratory illness in a host. When the influenza virus is epidemic, it can easily spread across borders due to its strong infectiousness. Also, it may be unpredictably variously mutated, thereby causing interspecific infection. Thus, it is necessary to provide worldwide common countermeasures and monitoring systems. An influenza virus is taxonomically defined as a member of Orthomyxovirus, and has three types of A, B, and C. Especially, A, and Btypes are epidemically spread. Type A influenza has a high mutatability, and zoonotically infects birds, pigs, and horses, as well as humans. Furthermore, the type A influenza includes various subtypes according to a combination of surface antigens (HA and NA). Unlike type A influenza, type B influenza causes relatively light symptoms, and infects humans and seals. Especially, in humans, it mainly causes an illness in children. Type C influenza can infect humans and pigs, but is known to have relatively low pathogenicity to humans. On the surface of these viruses, two kinds of surface antigens (that is, glycoproteins of Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA)) exist. Also, within the viruses, 8 fragmented RNAs exist. Hemagglutinin has a trimer structure including a head and a stem. The head region is related to most antigen mutations, which attaches the virus to a host cell by binding to a terminal sialic acid residue on the surface of the host cell, and sequentially allows the virus to penetrate the host cell. Neuraminidase is a mushroom-shaped tetramer with a head and a stem. On the surface of the head, an active region exists, which cleaves the alpha-ketosidic bond linking a terminal neuraminic acid residue to the oligosaccharide moiety on the cell surface. This cleavage performs an important role when a replicated and propagated virus within the infected cell comes out from the host cell and penetrates a respiratory organ mucous membrane cell. Surface antigens of a virus are mutated in the same subtype, and a new antigen mutant strain appears annually. Especially, from among influenza viruses, an avian influenza virus that has been problematic recently, infects various kinds of birds such as chickens, turkeys, ducks and wild birds through antigenic shift and quickly spreads. When chickens are infected with the virus, the morality rate is 80% or more. Thus, it is a virus causing serious damage and threatening the poultry farming industry worldwide. Further, it is reported that its ripple effect is not limited to the poultry farming industry. In other words, the virus may spread to humans by infecting a human body. Accordingly, research on the treatment of a virus may include inhibition of adsorption into an epithelial cell, inhibition of penetration into a cell, inhibition of transcription and replication of a gene, inhibition of protein synthesis, inhibition of release from a cell, and the like. Each of these is an objective of development of a novel antiviral drug. TABLE 0 STRUCTURE 1. Amantadine STRUCTURE 2. Rimantadine STRUCTURE 3. Oseltamivir Phosphate STRUCTURE 4. Zanamivir Conventionally developed representative therapeutic agents for treating an influenza virus include 4 materials such as Amantadine, Rimantadine, Zanamivir, and Oseltamivir, which were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (see STRUCTURES 1 to 4). Amantadine or Rimantadine is an M2 ion channel blocker having activity only against a Hemagglutinin virus strain (an influenza virus), and interrupts replication of a virus particle introduced into a host cell. These drugs are effective in only type A influenza virus A. Also, since they have been used for 40 years, it is known that a virus resistant to the drugs has been generated, and the drugs cause serious side effects in the nervous system and the stomach. Meanwhile, Oseltamivir (Korean Patent Publication No. 10-1998-0703600) or Zanamivir (Korean Registered Patent 0169496) is a Neuraminidase inhibitor having activity only against a Neuraminidase virus strain (influenza virus) and interrupts a replicated virus from escaping from a host cell. The two kinds of therapeutic agents intervene in one process of influenza virus infection and interrupt the process, thereby inhibiting of the propagation of a virus. However, Zanamivir has a high antiviral effect, but has disadvantages such as a low bioavailability and a quick release from the kidney. Also, in Oseltamivir, there have been reported some side effects such as generation of a resistant virus, and serious emesis symptoms. Following these drugs used as antiviral therapeutic agents, mutant viruses having serious side effects, tolerance, and strong resistance have rapidly appeared recently. Thus, their application requires great care. Also, in the development of a vaccine, there is a problem in that when an epidemic virus type does not correspond to a virus of the vaccine, the effect is insignificant. Accordingly, it is highly required to develop an improved drug that has a high effect in treatment and prevention of influenza infection, and has a high stability. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION Technical Problem Through research, the inventors of the present invention invented, as a better antiviral agent than a conventional agent, a novel phenyl-isoxazol compound having a high influenza virus inhibiting activity, and a high preventive effect of virus replication, which can treat or prevent an illness caused by an influenza virus. The present invention has been made to solve the above mentioned disadvantages. As a result, the inventors found a compound represented by Formula 1, which has a different novel structure from a conventionally developed compound structure. Then, based on the finding, they completed this invention. Solution to Problem In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a phenyl-isoxazol derivative represented by Formula 1 below, or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, prodrug, or composite. In Formula above, R1, R2 and R3 each independently represents hydrogen, lower alkyl optionally substituted with halogen, lower alkoxy optionally substituted with halogen, or halogen, R4 represents methyl or amine, and R8 may be substituted with a radical of Formula 2 below, or substituted with a radical of Formula 3 below, wherein, R5, R6 and R7 each independently represents hydrogen, lower alkyl optionally substituted with halogen, hydroxy, lower alkoxy or halogen, and R9 represents lower alkyl. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a composition including the inventive compound, or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, prodrug, or composite, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition for treating or preventing virus infection, the composition includes the inventive compound, or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, prodrug, or composite, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In accordance with a still further aspect of the present invention, there is provided the use of the preventive compound, or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, prodrug, or composite, for preparing a pharmaceutical composition for treatment or prevention of virus infection. In accordance with a still yet further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for preventing or treating virus infection, the method including the step of administering a therapeutically effective amount of the inventive compound, or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, prodrug, or composite, to mammals, including humans, requiring virus infection treatment or prevention. Mode for the Invention Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail. An influenza virus infection caused by an influenza virus is an illness frequently lethal to humans and animals. The influenza virus causes an infectious acute febrile respiratory organ illness in a host. When the influenza virus is epidemic, it can easily spread across borders due to its strong infectiousness. Also, it may be unpredictably variously mutated, thereby causing interspecific infection. Thus, it is necessary to provide worldwide common countermeasures and monitoring systems. However, unlike an antifungal agent, etc. there exist only limited kinds of drugs applicable to influenza. For example, at present, representative therapeutic agents that have been recently used as Neuraminidase inhibitors include Oseltamivir and Zanamivir. These therapeutic agents perform a role of inhibiting the propagation of an influenza virus. However, Zanamivir has a high antiviral effect but has disadvantages such as a low bioavailability and a quick release from a kidney. Also, in Oseltamivir, there have been reported some side effects such as generation of a resistant virus, and serious emesis symptoms. The inventors of the present invention found a compound represented by Formula 1 below, that is, a phenyl-isoxazol derivative, which has a higher antiviral activity against an influenza virus, and a higher susceptibility to a virus replication inhibitor inhibiting virus replication than its corresponding Oseltamivir phosphate. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound represented by Formula 1 below, and its pharmaceutically acceptable derivative. In Formula 1, R1, R2, R3, R4 and R8 are the same as defined above. In the present invention, it is understood that “a compound represented by Formula 1” (or “the inventive compound”), as long as not explicitly stated otherwise, includes its hydrate, solvate, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, composite, and pharmaceutically acceptable derivative including diastereomer or enantiomer. In the present invention, the term “lower alkyl” indicates a straight-chain or branched saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical that preferably includes 1 to 12 carbon atoms, alternatively 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or alternatively 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of the alkyl radical may include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, secondary-butyl, tertiary-butyl, pentyl, isoamyl, n-hexyl, and the like, but the present invention is not limited thereto. In the present invention, an alkyl group may be optionally substituted. Also, the term “alkoxy” indicates oxygen added with an alkyl substituent. In the present invention, an alkoxy group may be optionally substituted. Also, the term “lower halo alkyl” indicates a straight-chain or branched saturated aliphatic radical that preferably includes 1 to 12 carbon atoms, alternatively 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or alternatively 1 to 6 carbon atoms, in which hydrogen is substituted with halogen. Also, the term “halogen” indicates an atom of fluoro, chlorine, bromine or iodine, and preferably indicates fluoro or chlorine. In the present invention, a halogen group may be optionally substituted. The inventive compound also includes a salt within the scope of the present invention. It is understood that the inventive compound, e.g., the compound represented by Formula 1, as long as not explicitly stated otherwise, includes its salt. In this specification, the term “salt” indicates an acidic and/or basic salt formed from inorganic and/or organic acid and base. The salt of the inventive compound may be, for example, formed by reacting the inventive compound with an acid or a base in the same amount as that of the compound in a medium or aqueous medium capable of precipitating the salt. Non-limiting examples of the salt may include the following salts. The compound may be reacted with acetic acid, adipic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, camphoric acid, camphorsulfonic acid, citric acid, cyclamate, ethane-1,2-disulphonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 2-hydroxy ethanesulfonic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, bromic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, malic acid, maleic acid, methanesulfonic acid, naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid, naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic acid, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthalate, nicotinic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, oxalic acid, p-toluene sulfonic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, oxalic acid, amino acid (e.g., lysin), salicylic acid, 2,2-chloroacetic acid, L-aspartic acid, (+)-(1S)-camphor-10-sulfonic acid, 4-acetamido benzoic acid, caproic acid, cinnamic acid, gentistic acid, glutaric acid, malonic acid, mandelic acid, ortic acid, pamoate, aminosalicylic acid or the like to form an acid addition salt. When a lot of basic groups exist, a mono or poly acid addition salt may be formed. Also, the compound represented by Formula 1 has ethylester as a functional group, and thus may form a carboxyl group. Under an acidic or basic condition, for example, at pH 11-12 (with a base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, or ammonium hydroxide) or at pH 2-3 (with an acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid), ethylester of the compound represented by Formula 1 may be hydrolyzed. The hydrolyzed compound represented by Formula 1 includes a carboxyl group, thereby forming a cation and a salt. There is no specific limitation in the kind of such a salt, as long as it is pharmaceutically acceptable. Examples of such a salt may include an alkaline metal salt, such as sodium, potassium and lithium salt an alkaline earth metal salt, such as calcium and magnesium salt other metal salts, such as aluminum, iron, zinc, copper nickel, and cobalt salt other inorganic salts, such as ammonium salt an amine salt, such as t-octylamine, dibenzylamine, morpholin, glucosamine, phenylglycine alkyl ester, ethylenediamine, methylglucamine, guanidine, diethylamine, triethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, procaine, diethaneolamine, benzylphenethylamine, piperazine, tetraethylammonium and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane salt. In this specification, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable derivative” indicates the inventive compounds hydrate, solvate, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, or composite, which maintains the required biological activity of the compound and does not show an unwanted toxicological effect. The present invention also includes a prodrug of the inventive compound. The term “prodrug” indicates a compound covalently bonded to a carrier. The prodrug may release an active ingredient while being administered to a mammal subject. The release of the active ingredient may occur within a living body, and the prodrug may be prepared by technologies known to a person skilled in the art. In such technologies, in a certain compound, an appropriate functional group is modified. However, the modified functional group regenerates an original functional group through a general operation or within a living body. Non-limiting examples of the prodrug include ester (e.g., acetate, formate, and benzoate derivative) and the like. The inventive compound has an inhibiting activity against a strain of an influenza virus, and is highly effective in the treatment and the prevention of infection of influenza having susceptibility to a virus replication inhibitor inhibiting virus replication, and other similar viruses. According to an embodiment of the present invention, in the compound represented by Formula 1, preferably, when the radical in Formula 2 is substituted for R8, two from among R1, R2 and R3 represent hydrogen, the remaining one represents lower alkyl optionally substituted with halogen, lower alkoxy optionally substituted with halogen, or halogen, preferably fluoro or chlorine.

When the radical in Formula 3 is substituted for R8, two from among R1, R2 and R3 represent hydrogen, the remaining one represents lower alkyl optionally substituted with halogen, lower alkoxy optionally substituted with halogen, or halogen, R4 represents amine, and R9 represents lower alkyl. In another embodiment of the present invention, in the compound represented by Formula 1, more preferably, when the radical of Formula 2 is substituted for R8, two from among R1, R2 and R3 represent hydrogen, the other one represents trifluoromethyl, fluoro, or trifluoromethoxy, R4 represents methyl or amine, from among R5, R6 and R7, one or two each independently represents hydrogen, methoxy, chlorine, fluoro, trifluoromethyl or hydroxy; or R1 represents halogen, preferably chlorine, R4 represents methyl or amine, R2, R3, R5, and R7 each represents hydrogen, and R6 represents alkoxy, preferably methoxy. When the radical of Formula 3 is substituted for R8, R4 represents amine, two from among R1, R2 and R3 represent hydrogen, the remaining one represents trifluoromethyl, fluoro, or trifluoromethoxy, and R9 represents methyl or ethyl. In view of inhibition of influenza virus, especially, when the radical of Formula 2 is substituted for R8, R1 represents trifluoromethyl, or trifluoromethoxy, R2 and R3 represent hydrogen, R4 represents methyl, and from among R5, R6 and R7, one or two each independently represents hydrogen, hydroxy, methoxy, or chlorine R1 represents chlorine, R4 represents methyl, R2, R3, R5 and R7 represent hydrogen, and R6 represents methoxy or R2 represents fluoro, trifluoromethyl, or trifluoromethoxy, R1 and R3 represent hydrogen, R4 represents methyl or amine, and from among R5, R6 and R7, one or two each independently represents hydrogen, hydroxy, methoxy, trifluoromethyl or chlorine. Meanwhile, when the radical of Formula 3 is substituted for R8, R1 represents trifluoromethoxy, R2 and R3 represent hydrogen, R4 represents amine, and R9 represents ethyl. The inventive compound represented by Formula 1 may be prepared by the following synthesis process. The isomer and solvate (e.g., hydrate) of the compound represented by Formula 1 are also within the scope of the present invention. The solvation method is generally known in the art. Accordingly, the inventive compound may be used in the form of a pharmaceutically useful hydrate or salt, and obtained by the method described by Reaction Scheme below. The inventive compound of Formula 1 is prepared by the steps of: reacting a compound represented by Formula 4 below preferably with hydroxylammoniumchloride in the presence of a base to produce a compound represented by Formula 5 below chlorinating the compound represented by Formula 5 so as to produce a compound represented by Formula 6 below cyclizing the compound represented by Formula 6 so as to produce a compound represented by Formula 7 below as an isoxazol compound removing R10 as a protecting group of Formula 7 so as to produce a compound represented by Formula 8 and reacting the compound represented by Formula 8 with a compound represented by Formula 2 or Formula 3 so as to produce a compound represented by Formula 9a or Formula 9b. In Formulas above, R1 to R9 are the same as defined above, and R10 represents lower alkyl, preferably methyl, ethyl or isopropyl group. In Reaction scheme 1 above, R1 to R10 are the same as defined above. A phenylaldehyde compound (I) having R1, R2 and R3 substituted onto a benzene ring was commercially available. The phenylaldehyde compound (I) is reacted with hydroxylammoniumchloride or its equivalent in the presence of a base so as to synthesize a compound of benzaldehyde oxime (II). Then, through a chlorination reaction, a benzimidoyl chloride compound (III) is produced. An isoxazol compound (V) in which R is substituted with methyl or amine may be obtained through a generally used synthesis method (cyclization reaction) by using alkyl acetoacetate or alkyl cyanoacetate. From a phenyl-isoxazol derivative compound (V, R4=methyl) or a compound (V, R4=amine) including a carboxyl group and an amine group, a phenyl-isoxazol derivative compound (VIa or VIb) is produced by using 1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimidehydrochloride (EDCl) or hydroxybenzotriazol (HOBt) in the presence of a base. The inventive preparation method may be carried out preferably in a solvent in the presence of a base or an acid. Herein, there is no specific limitation in a solvent, an acid, and a base as long as they have no adverse effect on the reaction. For example, the solvent may be at least one kind selected from the group consisting of tetrahydrofuran, methylenechloride, ethanol, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, ethyllacetate, tert-butanol, toluene, and dioxane. The base may be at least one kind selected from the group consisting of pyridine, triethylamine, diethylamine, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydride, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, lithium aluminum hydride, lithium borohydride, and sodium nitrate, and cesium carbonate. The acid may be at least one kind selected from the group consisting of trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, bromic acid, and acetic acid. Starting materials used in the preparation of the inventive compounds according to the method are commercially available, or can be easily bought. The reaction may be generally carried out under a cooling or heating condition. After the reaction, through a general after-treatment process, such as column chromatography, recrystallization, etc. a final compound may be purified. Meanwhile, the present invention is related to a pharmaceutical composition for treating or preventing virus infection, in which the compound represented by Formula 1, or its pharmaceutically acceptable derivative is administered in an effective amount to mammals, including humans. Especially, the composition is effective in inhibiting influenza infection, and thus may be effectively used in the treatment of such an illness. When the inventive compounds determined to be effective in inhibiting the illness is administered, a single dose or a multiple dose generally ranges from 0.01 to 750 mg/kg per day, preferably ranges from 0.1 to 100 mg, and most preferably ranges from 0.5 to 25 mg. However, the specific dose for an individual patient may vary according to a specific compound, a patient's weight, sex, diet, a drug administration time, an administration method, a release ratio, a drug mixing ratio, a patient's state, age, etc. The inventive compound may be administered without being processed in the treatment. However, the active ingredient is preferably provided as a pharmaceutical formulation. Accordingly, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation obtained by mixing a compound represented by Formula 1 or its pharmaceutically acceptable derivative with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipient. Also, the inventive compound may be administered via any suitable route. However, preferably, the compound is administered by injection or in oral form. An injection preparation, for example, a sterile injection aqueous or oily suspension, may be prepared by using an appropriate material such as a dispersant, a wetting agent or a suspension according to a known art. As a solvent, water, ringer's solution or isotonic NaCl solution may be used. Also, sterile fixed oil is also generally used as a solvent or a suspension medium. For this, any nonirritating fixed oil, including monoglyceride or di-glyceride, may be used. Also, fatty acid such as oleic acid may used in injection preparation. A solid administration form for oral administration may include capsule, tablet, pill, powder and granule forms. Especially, capsule and tablet forms are preferred. Preferably, tablet and pill forms are prepared as intestinal drugs. The solid administration form may be prepared by mixing the inventive active compound represented by Formula 1 with at least one inert diluent (such as sucrose, lactose, starch), a lubricant (such as magnesium stearate), and a carrier (such as a disintegrating agent, a binding agent, etc.). The inventive compound has an inhibiting activity against a strain of an influenza virus, and may be used to treat and prevent infection of influenza having susceptibility to a Neuraminidase inhibitor or a virus replication inhibitor inhibiting virus replication, and other similar viruses. Herein, it may be used in combination with a secondary therapeutic agent having an activity against the same virus. This compound, for example, may be used in combination with Zanamivir, Oseltamivir, Amantadine, Rimantadine or the like. The administration amount of each compound may be the same or different, compared to the administration amount of the compound alone. Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to Preparation Examples and Examples. However, Preparation Examples and Examples, as described below, are illustrative only, and do not limit the present invention.

After 24 to 72 hours, through a fluorescent microscope, a GFP signal was observed. Then, a cell not treated with a virus and a compound at all, and a cell only infected with an influenza virus were used as control groups. If the compound has an antiviral effect, it can be observed that the GFP signal is decreased according to an increase of the concentration of the compound. EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 2 Virucidal Assay by Plaque Reduction Assay In this experiment, before a cell is infected with a virus, the virus is directly treated with a compound so as to determine if the compound has an effect on the inhibition of the intracellular penetration of the influenza virus. For this, first, a compound with different concentrations was reacted with an influenza virus at room temperature for 1 hour. Then, an MDCK cell was infected with the virus for 1 hour, washed with PBS, and cultured in a medium including 2% oxoid agar. After 72 hours, the cell was dyed with crystal violet. Then, it was observed if a plaque was formed. At the positions added with the compound with different concentrations, the number and size of plaques were compared to those in the control groups. Then, through analysis of antiviral activity, EC50 was determined. EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 3 Cytotoxicity Assay Using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) In this experiment, a cell was infected with a virus, and then the virus was directly treated with a compound so as to determine if the virus-infected cell has toxicity. For this, a cell (MDCK) was infected with an influenza virus (K09) for 1 hour, and treated with the compound with different concentrations for 24 hours. Then, the cell was treated with a MTT reagent for 1 hour. After 1 hour, a formazan crystal produced by the MTT reagent was dissolved in DMSO, and the absorbance was measured by an ELISA reader so as to determine CC50. The antiviral efficacy test of the inventive compound was carried out on compounds according to Examples of this specification through Experimental Example 1 to Experimental Example 3. As a result, it was found that the inventive compound has a Formula structure having antiviral activity.

Especially, most of the compounds according to Examples of this specification showed a high effect in inhibition of propagation of an intracellular infected virus. At present, Oseltamivir (tamiflu) and Zanamivir (relenza) used as an influenza virus therapeutic agent are drugs which inhibit Neuraminidase related to the release of an influenza virus, thereby inhibiting movement of the virus to non-infected cells. Also, as other therapeutic agents, M2 ion channel inhibitors of an influenza virus such as Amantadine and Rimantadine are used. However, at present, from some research results, it has been reported that a mutant influenza virus resistant to Oseltamivir was discovered. This is because the influenza virus is an RNA virus that can be more easily mutated than DNA viruses. Accordingly, as advents and side effects of a virus resistant to Oseltamivir have increased, it is urgently required to develop an effective novel influenza virus therapeutic agent. Accordingly, compounds showing a high antiviral activity effect on a virus strain resistant to Oseltamivir (tamiflu), from Example 3, Example 4, Example 9, Example 11, Example 12, Example 16, Example 35, Example 60, and Example 124, and their derivatives are very useful drugs in the development of an effective novel influenza virus therapeutic agent. EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 4 An Acute Toxicity Test Through Oral Administration in a Rat The acute toxicity of the inventive compound was determined through oral administration in a rat. Since the compound is expected to be orally administered in a clinical situation, an oral administration route was selected. A male rat aged 6 weeks (SD-Rat, 220±30 g) was subjected to quarantine, and acclimated for 1 week under a condition of lighting of 12 hours (08:00˜20:00), and luminance of 150-300 Lux at 22±3° C. at a relative humidity of 50±20%, while being freely fed with feed and water. Each of a control group and an experimental group include 8 rats. The control group was orally administered with 0.5% HPMC, and the experimental group was orally administered with a material (different concentrations) suspended in 0.5% HPMC, by using a sonde in an amount in proportion to the measured weight of each individual. The concentration of the drug administered to the experimental group was set as 2000 mg/kg (the highest concentration for a single dose administration in a non-clinical test), and 1000 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg (with a common ratio). For 14 days from drug administration, clinical symptoms were observed while the weight change was measured. Test animals that died during the test were subjected to autopsy, and abnormalities of main organs (heart, liver, lung, spleen, kidney, and large intestine) were observed and recorded. On the last day of the test (on the 14th day from the administration), all individuals were subjected to autopsy, and the changes of the organs caused by a test material were observed and compared to those in the control group. In the control group, no rats had died, and abnormalities were not observed through autopsy. Each group was orally administered in a concentration of 500 mg/kg, 1000 mg/kg, and 2000 mg/kg. For 14 days from the administration, according to the test method, clinical symptoms were observed. On the last day of the test (on the 14th day from the administration), changes of the organs were observed with a naked eye through autopsy. The control group, and experimental groups administered with 500 mg/kg, 1000 mg/kg, and 2000 mg/kg did not show any premonitory symptoms right after administration. Also, in the groups administered in various amounts, no individuals died. Also, all administration groups showed a similar weight increase ratio irrespective of the amount of a drug during the observation period. Further, no abnormal responses were observed, and from the autopsy results, no peculiarities were observed. The results of this experiment are noted in Table 3, from which it was found that the compounds of Examples have an LD50 value of 2000 mg/kg or more in oral administration. From this result, it can be determined that the inventive compound is a safe material in view of acute toxicity.
