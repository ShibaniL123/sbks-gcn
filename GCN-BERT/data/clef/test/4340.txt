AN INFANT BED Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an infant bed, in particular an infant bed for adjustment of the bed’s infant support surface; more particularly but not exclusively a device or bed arranged for controlled elevation of an infant mattress. Background Cribs, cots, bassinets or cradles or similar are of great importance to families with an infant, and have assumed an increasing importance. This is due to medical data on infant deaths and reflux, both indicating differing requirements, wherein reflux is prevented by tilting, and sudden infant death syndrome has been linked to sleeping positions. Ageing populations in many societies and increasing pressure on working age parents has led to later life parents and increasing amounts of childcare from older carers. Cradles or similar are of a relatively standard form, and have a mattress on top of a slatted base, resting in and or on an elevated vertically slatted enclosure in order that the infant can be contained, is comfortable, and can see out. Unfortunately it can be difficult to elevate an end of the mattress to avoid problems with infant reflux, and it is liable to be difficult for carers of reduced mobility to reach the infant when on the mattress, due to the sides of the enclosure. Prior Art Accordingly a number of patent applications have been filed in an attempt to resolve the problem or similar, including the following: International patent application WO 2009 024 972 (COHEN et al) discloses a continuously height adjustable mattress support, which is vertically displaceable by means of at least one drive unit for applying a vertical force to a corresponding solely vertically displaceable driven component and is stabilized during vertical displacement by at least one stabilizing means connected thereto, said driven component being connected to, or being in supporting relation with, said mattress support, wherein a height of said mattress support above a floor surface is settable and continuously adjustable by means of at least one actuator associated with said at least one drive unit. United States patent application US 2012 297 537 (GUTIERREZ et al) discloses a baby crib adjustment apparatus, said apparatus comprising: a crib frame for securing a fixed frame and an elevator frame; a mattress resting on said elevator frame; a height adjusting mechanism for adjusting height of said elevator frame; an operating mechanism for operating and locking said height adjusting mechanism; and a levelling mechanism for maintaining the level of said elevator frame horizontally stable. United States patent application US 7 827 631 (HOLMAN) discloses a baby crib comprising; a frame movably supported by posts; a mattress supported on the frame, the frame being movable between a raised position and a lowered position; a protective enclosure surrounding the frame and mattress, having at least one portion movable between a raised and a lowered position; a first elevation mechanism for moving the frame between the lowered position and the raised position, and a second elevation mechanism for moving the enclosure portion between the raised position and the lowered position; and a controller responsive to a user's inputs to selectively activate the first elevation mechanism, the second elevation mechanism or both mechanisms to move the frame with the bed and the movable enclosure portion to positions selected by the user between their respective raised and lowered positions. Summary of the Invention According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an infant bedbase adapted to receive a mattress, in which the bedbase comprises at least one extending member; wherein the bedbase is arranged to progressively elevate at least part of the mattress as at least one member extends. Preferably the bedbase is a self-contained device for use with a standard infant bed. According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an infant bed comprising: an enclosure; a mattress and a bedbase as herein described. Preferably the bedbase cooperates with a standard base independently or standardly provided for the bed, wherein the subordinate mattress surface is provided in use by a bedbase device is used below or above the standard base. In other embodiments such device replaces the standard base. Preferably, the bedbase further comprises a return lock mechanism arranged in use to prevent retraction of the member or members. Preferably, the extending member(s) is arranged in use to move and extend to actuate lifting mechanisms. For example hydraulic members may extend or retract, so as to displace lift struts in grooves, for example embodied as scissor lifts. Advantageously therefore rotation about pivots provide elevation, with weight being transferred across axes and planes, the resulting elevations being significantly less prone to catastrophic failure. The extension is preferably displaced from the bed’s surface and mattress and consequently likelihood of damage and injury is minimised as well as failures being dampened. In preferred embodiments elevation of the mattress is actuated at both or only one end of the mattress, so as to allow uniform lifting and/or tilting. Preferably more than one member extends, particularly in elevation of both ends of the mattress wherein weight and elevation is distributed within or around the device, wherein transference of weight is further distributed across more than one potential point of weakness. Preferably the extending members are contained within a rigid frame or frames, comprising the bedbase, and consequently the device is easy to insert into or onto a standard base format without risk of damage to the bed, infant or user. Preferably the bedbase comprises extending members configured to selectively elevate one end of an elongate mattress. In some embodiments an articulation on or in the bedbase or member(s) allows direction of elevation. Preferably in some embodiments the bedbase is embodied in more than one frame. The extension member(s) are preferably contained in a frame slidably acting to elevate another frame, by means of pivoted struts joining the frames, which struts transfer linear movement of the members to elevation of at least part of the frame, transferring the elevation. Preferably elevation of the bed surface with respect to the enclosure is embodied in a separate mechanism to tilting of the mattress with respect to the enclosure. In this way the frames may comprise more than one set of extending members and displaceable struts. Advantageously tilting and elevation are separated for safety and efficiency. Preferably the bedbase is adjustable in length and/or width, wherein the bedbase includes telescopic sections, arranged so as to ensure that variable sizes of enclosure may be accommodated. In some embodiments it may be envisaged that the infant mattress may be installed directly onto the bedbase. In other embodiments a standard base independently provided on the enclosure, for example as standard slatted fitting, may be interposed under or over the bedbase of the invention. In embodiments where the bedbase is placed under the standard base, the standard base advantageously provides a standard bed surface for a mattress and the bedbase is supported on standard base supports. Preferably in embodiments where the bedbase is placed on top of the standard base, said standard base provides a surface from which at least part of the bedbase may be elevated. Preferably member or members are elevated by a control mechanism, wherein said mechanism is operable to extend remotely. Remotely may intend at floor level, in order that a user can operate the control mechanism, and extension, conveniently for example using their feet. Preferably in some embodiments said control mechanism may comprise at least one foot pump, for example in embodiments requiring manual elevation of an end of the bedbase, and a second pump for elevation of an upper frame of the bedbase from a lower frame. In other embodiments said control mechanism may preferably include automation or electric power, wherein powered elevation may combine with further controls. In some further embodiments the control mechanism may include a wired or wireless remote unit, for operation by the user’s hands. Said unit is envisaged to allow multiple control functions, such as elevation speed. Preferably the extending members and any moving parts are encased or surrounded in some form of shielding, advantageously resiliently deformable to account for movement.

Detailed Description of Figures With reference to the figures the bedbase is formed from aluminium or steel tubular sections and members, with parts formed with coaxial sections, configured to telescopically extend. The sections describe an upper frame 1, a mid-frame 2 and a lower frame 3. Said frames interoperate with reference to each other by means of struts 12,13,18, wherein said struts are mounted on pivots 11,19,21,22. The pivots include central boss pivots 9 and end pivots 11,19,21,22,, wherein at least two of the end pivots 21 are configured slidably in grooves 25, 26 in the frames; and the struts are driven by the extension and retraction of piston members 4, 24, which in turn move bars 22,23. The members are consisted of hydraulic or pneumatic pistons. The tilt mechanism, comprising a single telescopic member 24 and two side struts18, is only operable when all the frames are together, in order to minimise chances of danger to the infant on the surface when elevated, and acts to elevate an end of the bed surface with reference to the enclosure, tilting the upper frame. The strut ends slide on the middle frame in order for tilt wherein the struts’ distal ends pivot rotate in the top frame pivots 19. In order to elevate the bed surface a scissor lift provides parallel elevation of the top frame from the bottom frame with four side struts, pivoted and joined centrally, driven by a bar driven by hydraulic pistons. In some embodiments of the infant bed the members, and lift, and tilt mechanism, are surrounded by shielding as in Figures 5, 103. The side struts slide on or in the lowest frame. The struts travel in slots, which slots have covers 27 there over, to avoid damage to fingers or similar. The covers are fixed to the pivots at through-holes 28. Two bars travel in one slot in the middle frame, regarding the top frame and the bottom frame, and with reference to the lifting mechanisms. Cut-outs 29 in the bottom frame accept the central pivots in folding. The struts, frame and members are powder coated or covered in plastic, in order to minimise damage to the infant, mattress, user or enclosure. The struts are surrounded in use by fabric sheathing, to ensure no danger is present to fingers of the infant or user. The bedbase is elevated in use by a control mechanism sited remotely in use, at floor level. In this way the control mechanism may be controlled by a user’s foot. For example a pedal may be utilised (not shown). The bedbase elevates from the standard base placed in the enclosure as per standard practice. In this way the bedbase is embodied to elevate from said standard base. The bedbase is accordingly telescopically adjustable to fit variations of standard bases and mattresses. In use the mattress is placed over the adjusted bedbase. In some further embodiments the infant head in use is envisaged to be at the end that is not adjusted or adjustable, to maximise comfort. The bedbase is comprised by the top frame and comprises a standard base format, comprises a number of slats 14 arranged across a rigid perimeter, wherein the slats allow airflow to the mattress and the perimeter maintains the slats rigid, to form a solid and stable mattress surface. The rigid perimeter of the top and bottom frames comprises a telescopically adjustable periphery 20 which has nesting corners 26. The frame peripheries are adjusted at screw threaded bolts which ideally have adjustment securement nuts (not shown). The struts that join the upper bedbase and lower bedbase are hinged centrally at a pivot, and at ends by end pivots. Two of said end pivots are capable of sliding in slots in order to allow the struts to up stand and become more vertically parallel. The cross-brace 15 joins the central pivots 9 to create stability in elevation and ensure that struts move in tandem. A control mechanism is embodied in a control unit 16 with electrical motor. This unit is controlled by a wired controller 17, which controller includes controls for tilt and elevation and lowering. The device is in use with an enclosure 100, a slatted standard base 101 and mattress 102.
