FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to blended thermoplastic compositions, and in one aspect to blended thermoplastic compositions capable of being used in a laser direct structuring process. The present invention also relates to methods of manufacturing these compositions and articles that include these compositions. BACKGROUND Electrical components can be provided as molded injection devices (MID) with desired printed conductors, e.g., when manufactured in MID technology, using different methods, e.g., a masking method, in two-component injection molding with subsequent electroplating (or electroless plating), because for some cases, chemical plating is used for 2-component injection molding. In contrast to conventional circuit boards made of fiberglass-reinforced plastic or the like, MID components manufactured in this way are three-dimensional molded parts having an integrated printed conductor layout and possibly further electronic or electromechanical components. The use of MID components of this type, even if the components have only printed conductors and are used to replace conventional wiring inside an electrical or electronic device, saves space, allowing the relevant device to be made smaller, and lowers the manufacturing costs by reducing the number of assembly and contacting steps. These MID devices have great utility in cell phones, PDAs and notebook applications. Stamp metal, flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) mounted and two-shot molding methods are three existing technologies to make an MID. However, stamping and FPCB mounted process have limitations in the pattern geometry, and the tooling is expensive and also altering of a RF pattern causes high-priced and time-consuming modifications into tooling. 2-shot-molding (two-component injection molding) processes have been used to produce 3D-MIDs with real three-dimensional structures. The antenna can be formed with subsequent chemical corrosion, chemical surface activation and selective metal coating. This method involves high initial costs and is only economically viable for large production numbers. 2-shot-molding is also not environmentally friendly process. All these three methods are tool-based technologies, which have limited flexibility, long development cycles, difficult prototype, expensive design changes, and limited miniaturization. Accordingly, it is becoming increasingly popular to form MIDs using a laser direct structuring (LDS) process. In an LDS process a computer-controlled laser beam travels over the MID to activate the plastic surface at locations where the conductive path is to be situated. With a laser direct structuring process, it is possible to obtain small conductive path widths (such as of 150 microns or less). In addition, the spacing between the conductive paths can also be small. As a result, MIDs formed from this process save space and weight in the end-use applications. Another advantage of laser direct structuring is its flexibility. If the design of the circuit is changed, it is simply a matter of reprogramming the computer that controls the laser. SUMMARY In one aspect, the invention relates to blended thermoplastic compositions comprising a thermoplastic base resin, a laser direct structuring additive, and a mineral filler.

It is generally understood, as used herein, that it is the nominal value indicated ±10% variation unless otherwise indicated or inferred. The term is intended to convey that similar values promote equivalent results or effects recited in the claims. That is, it is understood that amounts, sizes, formulations, parameters, and other quantities and characteristics are not and need not be exact, but can be approximate and/or larger or smaller, as desired, reflecting tolerances, conversion factors, rounding off, measurement error and the like, and other factors known to those of skill in the art.

Blended Thermoplastic Compositions As briefly described above, the present invention, provides in one aspect, blended thermoplastic compositions comprising a thermoplastic base resin, a laser direct structuring additive, and a mineral filler. The disclosed blended thermoplastic compositions are capable of being used in a laser direct structuring (LDS) process and that provide enhanced plating performance while exhibiting good mechanical properties. In various further aspects, the thermoplastic base resin of the blended thermoplastic composition comprises an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS). In a further aspect, the ABS is a high rubber graft ABS (also referred to as a HRG ABS). Laser direct structuring technology provides a new way to make track structures arranged on a nonconductive material serving as antenna. Compared to the existing methods such as metal sheet stamping and 2-shot-molding, LDS realized the short development cycles, variation of design, cost reduction, miniaturization, diversification and functionality of the antenna, which is pushed by the market trend. LDS throws out the 2-shot-molding and enables MID blanks to be produced by single component injection molding. This single component contains laser activatable additives, which form metal clusters on the area where laser etched. During the following plating process, antenna designed can be formed. However, due to different chemical plating solutions/conditions used, the plating performance of LDS materials varies obviously, such as plating rate, adhesion of plating layers even with same LDS material. Accordingly, it would be beneficial to provide a LDS blended thermoplastic composition (or LDS compound) having good plating performance while maintaining good mechanical performance. It would also be beneficial to provide a LDS blended thermoplastic composition that is capable of being used in various applications due to the ability of the composition to provide good mechanical performance. It would also be beneficial to provide a thermoplastic composition that is capable of being used in a laser direct structuring process. As described in greater detail below, in one aspect, the disclosure relates to thermoplastic compounds that are capable of being used in a laser direct structuring (LDS) process and that provide enhanced plating performance while exhibiting good mechanical properties. The compositions include a thermoplastic base resin, a laser direct structuring additive, and a mineral filler. In certain aspects, blended thermoplastic compositions comprising a high rubber graft (HRG) type of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) instead of bulk ABS, plating performance (e.g., plating rate) the blended thermoplastic compositions and molded parts formed of blended polycarbonate (PC)/ABS based LDS compounds is improved with respect to LDS compounds having bulk ABS. In one aspect, higher loading of HRG ABS yields higher plating rate, e.g., plating rates with B % greater than about 18%. In other aspects, addition of a mineral filler, such as a silicate mineral filler, into a blended thermoplastic composition of the disclosure can yield an LDS compound having improved plating performance (e.g., higher plating rate than non-mineralized compounds). Loading of mineral filler the LDS compounds in such aspects ranges from about 3 wt % to about 5 wt %. In one aspect, addition of the mineral filler in the compounds can yield a two-fold increase in plating performance while maintaining mechanical properties of the compound similar to those compounds not having the mineral filler. Accordingly, in one aspect, the thermoplastic compositions of the present disclosure use a thermoplastic resin as the base for the composition. Examples of thermoplastic resins that can be used in the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, polycarbonate or a polycarbonate/acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resin blend; a poly(arylene ether) resin, such as a polyphenylene oxide resin, a nylon-based resin such as a polyphthalamide resin, or a combination including at least one of the foregoing resins. Without intent to be bound by theory, modeling, and/or experiment, it is believed that the improved plating performance (e.g., plating rate) arises from surface roughness and effective metal seeds present on the surface of the thermoplastic resin after treatment (e.g., blending) with rubber. In one aspect, the plating performance (e.g., plating rate) of molded parts formed of LDS compounds having blended polycarbonate (PC)/ABS, with the treated ABS, is improved with respect to LDS compounds having bulk ABS. The blended thermoplastic compositions (or compounds) of the disclosure can be used in a variety of applications such as personal computers, notebook and portable computers, cell phone antennas and other such communications equipment, medical applications, RFID applications, and automotive applications.

Laser Direct Structuring Additive In addition to the thermoplastic resin, the compositions of the present disclosure also include a laser direct structuring (LDS) additive. The LDS additive is selected to enable the composition to be used in a laser direct structuring process. In an LDS process, a laser beam exposes the LDS additive to place it at the surface of the thermoplastic composition and to activate metal atoms from the LDS additive. As such, the LDS additive is selected such that, upon exposed to a laser beam, metal atoms are activated and exposed and in areas not exposed by the laser beam, no metal atoms are exposed. In addition, the LDS additive is selected such that, after being exposed to laser beam, the etching area is capable of being plated to form conductive structure. As used herein “capable of being plated” refers to a material wherein a substantially uniform metal plating layer can be plated on laser-etched area and show a wide window for laser parameters. This process is different than laser marking wherein the main outcome of laser marking is a color change in the material under the effect of energy radiation. And the key characterization for laser marking is the contrast between the mark and the substrate. Conversely, for LDS, the goal is the formation of metal seeds on the laser etched surface, and the final metallization layer during the following plating process. Plating rate and adhesion of plated layers are the key evaluation requirements. Color here means the substrate made from these materials itself not the color change under the laser radiation. As such, in addition to enabling the composition to be used in a laser direct structuring process, the LDS additive used in the present disclosure is also selected to help enable the composition to be colored while maintaining physical properties. As previously discussed, current additives for LDS materials are usually spinel based metal oxides (such as copper chromium oxide), organic metal complexes (such as palladium/palladium-containing heavy metal complexes) or copper complexes there are some limitations based on these additives. However, spinel based metal oxides result in a black color. In addition, with organic metal complex, higher loadings are needed to obtain sufficiently dense nucleation for rapid metallization when activated, and these higher amounts adversely affect the mechanical properties of the materials. Accordingly, the present disclosure utilizes LDS additives that enable coloring of the material while retaining mechanical strength of the composition. Examples of LDS additives useful in the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, a metal oxide-coated filler. In one aspect of the present disclosure, the LDS additive is antimony doped tin oxide coating on a mica substrate. Other examples include a coating including a copper containing metal oxide, a zinc containing metal oxide, a tin containing metal oxide, a magnesium containing metal oxide, an aluminum containing metal oxide, a gold containing metal oxide, a silver containing metal oxide, or a combination including at least one of the foregoing metal oxides, and the substrate can be any other mineral, such as silica. The amount of the LDS additive included is sufficient to enable plating of the track formed after activation by the laser while not adversely affecting mechanical properties. In one aspect, the LDS additive is present in amounts of from 0.5 to 20 wt. %. In another aspect, the LDS additive is present in amounts from 1 to 15 wt. %. In still another aspect, the LDS additive is present in amounts from 3 to 10 wt. %. As discussed, the LDS additive is selected such that, after activating with a laser, the conductive path can be formed by followed a standard electroless plating process. When the LDS additive is exposed to the laser, elemental metal is released. The laser draws the circuit pattern onto the part and leaves behind a roughened surface containing embedded metal particles. These particles act as nuclei for the crystal growth during a subsequent plating process, such as a copper plating process. Other electroless plating processes that can be used include, but are not limited to, gold plating, nickel plating, silver plating, zinc plating, tin plating or the like. In addition to the thermoplastic resin, the LDS additive, and the optional colorant, the thermoplastic compositions of the present disclosure can include various additives ordinarily incorporated in resin compositions of this type. Mixtures of additives can be used. Such additives can be mixed at a suitable time during the mixing of the components for forming the composition. The one or more additives are included in the thermoplastic compositions to impart one or more selected characteristics to the thermoplastic compositions and any molded article made therefrom. Examples of additives that can be included in the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, heat stabilizers, process stabilizers, antioxidants, light stabilizers, plasticizers, antistatic agents, mold releasing agents, UV absorbers, lubricants, flow promoters or a combination of one or more of the foregoing additives. Any additive that would not adversely affect the colorability of the final composition can be included. In various aspects, the laser direct structuring (LDS) additive is selected from a heavy metal mixture oxide spinel, a copper salt, or a combination including at least one of the foregoing laser direct structuring additives. In a further aspect, the laser direct structuring (LDS) additive comprises a combination of copper chromium oxide and at least one additional additive selected from a heavy metal mixture oxide spinel, or a copper salt.

Methods of Manufacture The blended thermoplastic compositions of the present disclosure can be formed using any known method of combining multiple components to form a thermoplastic resin. In one aspect, the components are first blended in a high-speed mixer. Other low shear processes including but not limited to hand mixing can also accomplish this blending. The blend is then fed into the throat of a twin-screw extruder via a hopper. Alternatively, one or more of the components can be incorporated into the composition by feeding directly into the extruder at the throat and/or downstream through a sidestuffer. The extruder is generally operated at a temperature higher than that necessary to cause the composition to flow. The extrudate is immediately quenched in a water batch and pelletized. The pellets so prepared when cutting the extrudate can be one-fourth inch long or less as desired. Such pellets can be used for subsequent molding, shaping, or forming. In various aspects, the invention pertains to methods of forming an article, the method comprising the steps of: a) preparing a blended thermoplastic composition by combining: i) a polymer blend comprising: 1) a polycarbonate polymer in an amount from about 40 wt % to about 70 wt %; and 2) a high rubber graft acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (HRG-ABS) copolymer in an amount from about 10 wt % to about 25 wt %; ii) a styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN) copolymer in an amount from about 5 wt % to about 30 wt %; and iii) a laser direct structuring (LDS) additive in an amount from about 5 wt % to about 15 wt %; b) molding an article from the blended thermoplastic composition; c) using a laser to form a conductive path on the molded article; and d) plating a metal layer onto the conductive path; the molded article exhibits a mechanical strength greater than about 400 J/m. In a further aspect, using a laser to form a conductive path is laser direct structuring. In a still further aspect, laser direct structuring comprises laser etching. In a yet further aspect, laser etching is carried out to provide an activated surface. In a further aspect, laser etching is carried out at about 1 w to about 10 w power with a frequency from about 30 kHz to about 110 kHz and a speed of about 1 m/s to about 5 m/s. In a still further aspect, laser etching is carried out at about 1 w to about 10 w power with a frequency from about 40 kHz to about 100 kHz and a speed of about 2 m/s to about 4 m/s. In a yet further aspect, laser etching is carried out at about 3.5 w power with a frequency of about 40 kHz and a speed of about 2 m/s. In a further aspect, plating a metal layer onto a conductive path is metallization. In a still further aspect, metallization comprises the steps: a) cleaning the etched surface; b) additive build-up of tracks; and c) plating. In a further aspect, the metal layer is a copper layer. In a still further aspect, the metal layer has a thickness of about 0.8 micrometers or higher as measured according to ASTM B568. Articles Shaped, formed, or molded articles including the thermoplastic compositions are also provided. The thermoplastic compositions can be molded into useful shaped articles by a variety of means such as injection molding, extrusion, rotational molding, blow molding and thermoforming to form articles such as, for example, personal computers, notebook and portable computers, cell phone antennas and other such communications equipment, medical applications, RFID applications, automotive applications, and the like. The blended thermoplastic compositions, or compounds, of disclosed herein provide robust plating performance while maintaining good mechanical properties (e.g., Izod impact strength higher than about 400 J/m). Evaluation of the mechanical properties can be performed through various tests, such as Izod test, Charpy test, Gardner test, etc., according to several standards (e.g., ASTM D256). Robustness of plating performance can be measured via a performance ranking, or plating ranking, ranging from top performance (e.g., “best”) to bottom performance. The ranking can be partitioned in various levels. In one aspect, a plating ranking can have a level of “10” for top performance and a level of “0” for bottom performance. In several aspects, the LDS compounds (or compositions) include a fixed loading amount (e.g., about 10 wt %) of an LDS additive, such as copper chromium oxide, and varying amounts of thermoplastic base resins. In such aspects, fixed loading amounts of a stabilizer, an antioxidant, and a mold release agent were maintained in the LDS compounds. If bulk ABS is employed in blended PC/ABS based LDS compounds, the plating rank is 2, whereas utilization of a HRG type of ABS combined with styrene acrylonitrile (a copolymer of styrene and acrylonitrile referred to as SAN), to attain desired flow requirement(s), can yield a plating rank of about 4. It should be appreciated that other copolymers can be combined with the blended PC/ABS based LDS compounds of the disclosure. Without wishing to be bound by theory, modeling, and/or experiment, it is believed that such plating ranking increment can be due to presence of a large fraction of small rubber particles (e.g., rubber particles with dimensions of about 300 nm) in HRG ABS, wherein the rubber particles promote plating. The HRG ABS can be obtained by an emulsion method. It should be appreciated that in bulk ABS, there generally is a small fraction of larger rubber particles.

EXAMPLES The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how the methods, devices, and systems disclosed and claimed herein are made and evaluated, and are intended to be purely exemplary and are not intended to limit the disclosure. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.), but some errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, temperature is in degrees Celsius (° C.) or is at ambient temperature, and pressure is at or near atmospheric. There are numerous variations and combinations of reaction conditions, e.g., component concentrations, desired solvents, solvent mixtures, temperatures, pressures and other reaction ranges and conditions that can be used to optimize the product purity and yield obtained from the described process. Only reasonable and routine experimentation will be required to optimize such process conditions. In one aspect, as illustrated in Table 1, which presents data that illustrate the effect of ABS type and SAN loading in exemplary compound of the disclosure, increasing HRG loading yields improved plating performance. In another aspect, increasing SAN loading yields improve plating performance of the final compounds (see Table 1). As illustrated in Table I, plating rank can reach a value of about 5 as HRG ABS and SAN loading are increased. It should be noted that prior to chemical plating, laser etching with optimized laser etching parameters (such as laser power of about 3.5 W, frequency 40 Hz, and speed of about 2 m/s) was applied to the exemplary compounds illustrated in Table I.

For instance, addition of Talc in amounts ranging from about 3 wt % to about 5 wt % into LDS compounds can yield plating performance rank of 10, which represents a two-fold increase in plating performance when compared to LDS compounds not having talc. The mineral filler size can be relevant—even critical in some aspect—for adhesion of a plating layer. In one aspect, a beneficial size of the mineral filler can be in the range from about 0.1 μm to about 5.0 μm. In one aspect, compounds comprising a mineral filler (e.g., talc) can be plated well under a broad range of laser etching and chemical plating conditions. For example, laser etching parameters can be adjusted broadly (laser power from about 2 W to 9 W, frequency from about 40 KHz to 100 KHz, and speed from 2 m/s to 4 m/s) to achieve sufficient activated surface. Regarding plating, the LDS compounds having the mineral filler can permit generation of a plated surface with good adhesion in a short period of time. Table 2 illustrates several exemplary compounds and the effect of addition of a mineral filler into the formulation of LDS compounds in accordance with aspects of the subject disclosure. As illustrated, the LDS compounds resulting from addition of the mineral filler exhibit performance plating with ranking of about 8 and about 10, with an Izod impact strength greater than 400 J/m.
