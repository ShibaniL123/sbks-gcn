FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention pertains to the field of chemical synthesis. More particularly, the invention pertains to an integrated process for the production of acrylic acid and its derivatives by carbonylation of epoxide feedstocks. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Beta lactones are a class of chemical compounds that have great industrial potential For example, beta lactones (e.g., beta propiolactone (BPL)) can undergo reactions to produce valued chemical derivatives, including 3-hydroxypropionic acid and its esters, propanediol, acrylic acid, acrylate esters and amides, succinic anhydride, succinic acid, butanediol, polypropiolactone biodegradable polymers, and others. It also has some industrial uses itself as a specialty disinfectant to sterilize medical products. However, since beta propiolactone has been difficult to manufacture in a selective and high yielding fashion and because it has been found to be a probable human carcinogen, the use of this highly interesting and reactive chemical intermediate is limited. Some previous commercial applications which otherwise represented economically attractive processes, such as the manufacture of acrylic acid and its esters, have been phased out in favor of other alternatives. In the case of acrylic acid manufacture, the industry has turned to propylene oxidation. For many years propylene was a low cost feedstock and alternate routes to acrylic acid were of little interest. However because propylene production is tightly tied to petroleum refining its price fluctuates with crude oil prices. Propylene availability is further impacted by demands for other product in the refiningetroleum industry. As a result propylene prices have risen sharply in recent years. This dynamic has prompted interest in alternate routes to acrylic acid. The use of ethylene oxide (EO) as a feedstock for acrylic acid is increasingly attractive since EO can be derived from inexpensive ethylene sourced from natural gas production. Carbonylation of EO can provide beta propiolactone in excellent yield and selectivity, however the problems of handling and transporting this toxic chemical still remain. In order to take advantage of the unique chemical properties of beta propiolactone, which is just one example of the class of similar lactones which includes beta butyrolactone and other interesting lactone chemical intermediates, it is desired to develop integrated processes in which the purification or isolation of beta propiolactone is avoided. It is therefore a broad object of this invention to provide the integrated production and conversion of beta lactones, without their intermediate separation, with the aim of avoiding the potential exposure to the hazards of some of the class of lactones, while at the same time providing economically advantagous production processes. Commercially, beta propiolactone has in the past been produced by the reaction of ketene with formaldehyde. The production of ketene is based on the high temperature (700-750° C.) thermal dissociation of acetic acid in the presence of triethyl phosphate under a reduced pressure. This ketene process is mechanically complex, highly energy intensive and is a source of unwanted emissions to the atmosphere. After isolation, highly reactive monomeric ketene can be reacted with aldehydes to form beta lactones in the presence of aluminum chloride catalyst, commonly referred to as a Friedal-Crafts catalyst. Reaction of ketene and formaldehyde yields beta propiolactone. Reaction with acetaldehyde produces beta butyrolactone, while reaction with crotonaldehyde forms a polyester which is then thermally decomposed to sorbic acid. The aluminum chloride itself has many hazards it use, including potentially violent reactions of anhydrous aluminum chloride with water or bases. This very active catalyst also results in the formation of a number of unwanted byproducts that must be separated and removed from the desired lactone product leading to further handling challenges and additional opportunities for worker exposure. A general problem with the use of aluminum chloride Friedal-Crafts catalyst is that it is often consumed in the reaction, is very difficult to recover and regenerate, and commonly must be destroyed after use, generating a large amount of corrosive waste. Therefore, it is advantageous to rely on a better process for the production of beta lactones, and more particularly the intermediate, beta propiolactone, by the carbonylation of the corresponding epoxide, particularly ethylene oxide in the case of beta propiolactone. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In certain embodiments, the present invention provides methods for the production of derivatives of beta lactones (e.g., beta propiolactone) by integrating their production, for example by the carbonylation of ethylene oxide, with the conversion of beta propiolactone to acrylic acid, as one example of a number of possible valued derivatives. In certain embodiments, the invention provides integrated processes for the conversion of ethylene oxide and carbon monoxide to acrylic acid and its esters without the need to isolate beta propiolactone as a separate intermediate product. Applied to epoxides, such as ethylene oxide, carbonylation results in the simultaneous opening of the epoxide ring and the addition of carbon in the form of a carbonyl (C═O) functional group, resulting in the formation of a beta propiolactone by the general reaction Examples include: propylene oxide+CO→beta butyrolactone ethylene oxide+CO→beta propiolactone The carbonylation of epoxides can be catalyzed by metal carbonyls, most commonly Group VIII carbonyls and, in particular carbonyls of cobalt, at modest temperature and pressure. The carbonylation reaction can be run in the liquid phase with either a homogeneous (i.e., soluble) catalyst complex, or with a heterogeneous (i.e., active cobalt carbonyl fixed on a solid support) catalyst. The reaction can also be run in the vapor phase, using a heterogeneous, supported form of the cobalt catalyst. If the goal is the production of acrylic acid or acrylate esters, beta propiolactone undergoes thermolysis or alcoholysis respectively. One example is to react beta propiolactone with phosphoric acid using a copper powder catalyst at 140-180° C. and 25-250 bar to quantitatively form acrylic acid—this reaction is sometimes catalyzed by water. If the same reaction is run in the presence of an alcohol, the corresponding acrylate ester is formed directly. The thermolysis of beta propiolactone was in fact used as the basis for Celanese Corporation's production of about 35,000 tons/year of purified acrylic acid and its esters between 1957 and 1974. In that example, beta propiolactone was first isolated from the product of the reaction of formaldehyde with ketene, with the potential of worker exposure and environmental release of the hazardous intermediate, as the requirement of a high purity of final acrylic acid or acrylate ester product mandated the purification of the intermediate beta propiolactone to a high specification. This invention makes it possible to eliminate the hazards and costs associated with isolating the intermediate lactone by choosing the appropriate carbonylation and thermolysis process and conditions to allow a direct linking of the two reaction steps. In certain embodiments, the process of this invention can also be directly integrated to the formation of ethylene oxide, thus avoiding the isolation and storage of this toxic and potentially explosive intermediate. In certain embodiments, the processes of the present invention are fed by ethylene gas which is converted to ethylene oxide in a first reaction zone, the ethylene oxide from the first zone then feeds a second reaction zone where carbonylation takes place to yield BPL, the effluent from the second reaction zone is then fed to a third stage where the BPL is converted to acrylic acid or related acrylate derivatives. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a method for the synthesis of acrylic acid comprising the steps of: providing a gaseous feedstock stream comprising ethylene oxide and carbon monoxide;directing the feedstock stream to a first reaction zone where it is contacted with a metal carbonyl compound and where at least a portion of the ethylene oxide is converted to a carbonylation product stream comprising beta propiolactone;directing the carbonylation product stream to a second reaction zone where it is contacted with a catalyst which catalyzes the conversion of beta propiolactone to acrylic acid;withdrawing an acrylic acid product stream from the second reaction zone; andisolating acrylic acid from the product stream.

In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the synthesis of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate comprising the steps of: providing a gaseous feedstock stream comprising enantio-enriched propylene oxide and carbon monoxide;directing the feedstock stream to a first reaction zone where it is contacted with a metal carbonyl compound and at least a portion of the propylene oxide is converted to a product stream comprising beta butyrolactone;directing the product stream comprising beta butyrolactone to a polymerization reactor containing an optional solvent and a polymerization catalyst;withdrawing a poly-3-hydroxybutyrate product stream from the polymerization reactor; andisolating poly-3-hydroxybutyrate from the product stream.

Additionally, a variety of protecting groups are described by Greene and Wuts (infra). As described herein, compounds of the invention may contain “optionally substituted” moieties. In general, the term “substituted”, whether preceded by the term “optionally” or not, means that one or more hydrogens of the designated moiety are replaced with a suitable substituent.

Ia) The Feedstock Stream The first reaction stage (i.e. the stage fed by the epoxide feedstock stream) is also referred to herein as the carbonylation stage. The purpose of this stage is to convert the epoxide fed into the stage into a beta lactone by carbonylation. As noted above, the feedstock stream contains an epoxide and carbon monoxide. In certain embodiments, the feedstock stream comprises a C2-20 aliphatic or aromatic epoxide. In certain embodiments, the feedstock stream comprises a C2-12 aliphatic epoxide.

In certain embodiments, the feedstock stream comprises a gaseous mixture containing epoxide and carbon monoxide. In certain embodiments, the molar ratio of carbon monoxide to epoxide in feedstock stream ranges from about 1:1 to about 10,000:1.

In some embodiments, the ratio of carbon monoxide to epoxide in the feedstock stream is between about 50:1 to about 200:1. In certain embodiments, the gaseous feedstock stream comprises ethylene oxide (EO) and carbon monoxide (CO). In certain embodiments, the gaseous EO/CO stream is provided at a temperature, pressure, and EO:CO gas ratio such that the mixture is above the dew point of ethylene oxide. In certain embodiments, the gaseous EO/CO mixture comprises a greater partial pressure of carbon monoxide than ethylene oxide. In certain embodiments, the EO/CO gaseous feedstock stream is heated to maintain a temperature and pressure at which the ethylene oxide remains in the gas phase. Determining compositions, temperatures and pressures at which the EO/CO feedstock stream remains gaseous is within the capability of the skilled artisan, these mixtures can be determined experimentally, or by reference to the phase diagram of ethylene oxide. In certain embodiments, the feedstock stream further comprises one or more additional components. In certain embodiments, the additional components comprise diluents which do not directly participate in the chemical reactions of the epoxide or its derivatives. In certain embodiments, such diluents may include one or more inert gases (e.g. nitrogen, argon, helium and the like) or volatile organic molecules such as hydrocarbons, ethers, and the like. In certain embodiments, the feed stream may comprise hydrogen, traces of carbon dioxide, methane, and other compounds commonly found in industrial carbon monoxide streams. In certain embodiments, the feed stream may further comprise materials that may have a direct or indirect chemical function in one or more of the processes involved in the conversion of the epoxide to various end products. In certain embodiments, such functional materials may include, but are not limited to: volatile metal carbonyl compounds (e.g. HCo(CO)4) and the like), protic compounds (e.g. water or alcohols), and stabilizers (e.g. amine bases, phosphorous compounds and the like).

In certain embodiments, the feedstock stream is characterized in that it is essentially free of oxygen. In certain embodiments, the feedstock stream is characterized in that it is essentially free of water. In certain embodiments, the feedstock stream is characterized in that it is essentially free of oxygen and water. In certain embodiments, the feedstock stream provided in step i) of the above-described process comprises ethylene oxide. In certain embodiments, the ethylene oxide in the feedstock stream is obtained directly from the gas phase oxidation of ethylene. This embodiment is advantageous in that it avoids the need to isolate, store, and transport ethylene oxide which is both toxic and explosive. In certain embodiments, the ethylene oxide is maintained in the gas phase as produced and fed to the carbonylation stage without condensing it to a liquid. Thus, in certain embodiments, the present invention encompasses methods for the conversion of ethylene gas to acrylic acid or its derivatives, the process comprising the steps of: feeding ethylene to an oxidation stage to produce a reaction stream comprising ethylene oxide (preferably using known commercial processes such as oxidation by O2 in the presence of silver);contacting the ethylene oxide-containing stream with carbon monoxide in the presence of a metal carbonyl compound in a second stage to provide a product stream comprising beta propiolactone; anddirecting the beta propiolactone-containing product stream to a conversion stage where it is subjected to conditions to convert it to a final product selected from the group consisting of: acrylic acid, an acrylate ester, an acrylamide, and polypropiolactone. In certain embodiments, the ethylene oxide feedstock stream is first treated to remove water. In certain embodiments, the ethylene oxide feedstock stream is first treated to remove carbon dioxide. In certain embodiments, the method includes a step of adding carbon monoxide to the ethylene oxide stream. In certain embodiments, this addition of carbon monoxide is done before the ethylene oxide stream enters the carbonylation stage.

Typically, a single metal carbonyl compound is provided, but in certain embodiments, mixtures of two or more metal carbonyl compounds are provided. Preferably, the provided metal carbonyl compound is capable of ring-opening an epoxide and facilitating the insertion of carbon monoxide into the resulting metal carbon bond. Metal carbonyl compounds with this reactivity are well known in the art and are used for laboratory experimentation as well as in industrial processes such as hydroformylation. In some embodiments, a metal carbonyl compound in the carbonylation stage of the process comprises a compound with the general formula [QMy(CO)w]x, where: Q is any ligand or more than one ligand and need not be present;M is a metal atom;y is an integer from 1 to 6 inclusive;w is a number such as to provide the stable metal carbonyl; andx is an integer from −3 to +3 inclusive.

In other embodiments, a provided metal carbonyl compound comprises a neutral metal carbonyl compound (i.e. x is zero). In certain embodiments, a provided metal carbonyl compound comprises a metal carbonyl hydride. In some embodiments, a provided metal carbonyl compound acts as a pre-catalyst which reacts in situ with one or more reaction components, additives, or solid supports, to provide an active species different from the compound initially provided. Such pre-catalysts are specifically encompassed by the present invention as is the recognition that the active species in a given reaction may not be known with certainty, thus the identification of such a reactive species in situ, does not itself depart from the spirit or teachings of the present invention. In certain embodiments where the metal carbonyl compound comprises an anionic metal carbonyl species, the metal carbonyl species has the general formula [QMy(CO)w*]z−, where Q, M, and y are as defined above and in the classes and subclasses described herein, w* is an integer such as to provide a stable anionic metal carbonyl, and z is an integer from 1 to 3.

In certain embodiments, the anionic metal carbonyl comprises [Co(CO)4]−. In some embodiments, a mixture of two or more anionic metal carbonyl complexes may be present in the carbonylation stage.

It is to be understood that metals which can form stable metal carbonyl complexes have known coordinative capacities and propensities to form polynuclear complexes which, together with the number and character of optional ligands Q that may be present and the charge on the complex will determine the number of sites available for carbon monoxide to coordinate and therefore the value of w*. Typically, such compounds conform to the “18-electron rule”. Such knowledge is within the grasp of one having ordinary skill in the arts pertaining to the synthesis and characterization of metal carbonyl compounds. In embodiments where the provided metal carbonyl compound is an anionic species, one or more cations must also necessarily be present.

In these embodiments, the metal carbonyl compound may be present as a soluble compound (homogenous catalysis), optionally dissolved in a solvent, or may be present as a solid or solid-supported compound (heterogeneous catalysis). The reactants may be fed as gas or a liquid or as combinations of these. In certain embodiments where the first reaction zone is operated in a solution phase, the reaction zone includes a high boiling reaction medium such as a high boiling organic solvent or an ionic liquid that remains in the reaction zone as the beta lactone is stripped from the reactor outlet.

In some embodiments, the pressure can range from about 200 atmospheres to about 500 atmospheres (absolute). In some embodiments, the pressure can range from about 250 atmospheres to about 500 atmospheres (absolute). In certain embodiments, the first reaction zone may comprise one or more carbon monoxide inlets (i.e. carbon monoxide sources independent from carbon monoxide that may be introduced admixed with epoxide in the epoxide feedstock stream). In certain embodiments, the epoxide and the carbon monoxide are introduced to the first reaction zone via separate inlets. In some embodiments, the reaction pressure is supplied entirely by the carbon monoxide. For example, the reactants and catalyst are charged to the reactor at atmospheric pressure, or under a vacuum, and carbon monoxide is added to the reactor to increase pressure to the reaction pressure. In some embodiments, all reactants are supplied to the reactor at reaction pressure. In certain embodiments, the first reaction zone is at a temperature ranging from ambient to about 400° C. In certain embodiments, the first reaction zone is at a temperature ranging from about 50° C. to about 250° C. In certain embodiments, the temperature in the first reaction zone ranges from about 40° C. to about 200° C. In certain embodiments, the temperature in the first reaction zone ranges from about 50° C. to about 150° C. In certain embodiments, the temperature in the first reaction zone ranges from about 100° C. to about 220° C.

In some embodiments, the reactants and catalyst are supplied to the reactor at standard temperature, and then heated in the reactor. In some embodiments, the reactants are pre-heated before entering the reactor. In certain embodiments, the carbonylation in the first reaction zone is operated in a gas phase. In these embodiments, the epoxide and carbon monoxide are fed in the gas phase and the beta lactone produced in the reaction is removed via gas sweeping. In certain embodiments, the catalyst is a solid or solid supported. Generally, gas phase reactions are devoid of any solvent for reactants or catalyst. In certain embodiments, a gas phase in the first reaction zone may comprise primarily carbon monoxide and epoxide substrate, while in other embodiments, additional gases or diluents may also be present. In certain embodiments, such diluents may include nitrogen, hydrogen, hydrocarbon gases or the like. In certain embodiments, the atmosphere in the first reaction zone is essentially free of oxygen. In certain embodiments, the atmosphere in the first reaction zone is essentially free of water. In certain embodiments, the atmosphere in the first reaction zone is essentially free of water and oxygen. In some embodiments, the carbonylation reaction is performed in a continuous operation. The reactants are continuously fed to the first reaction zone. In some embodiments, the reactor includes a gas-entrainment impeller. The reactants may be fed to the reactor at standard temperature and pressure and then heated or pressurized to reaction conditions once in the reactor. The reactor itself may be any reactor conducive to continuous operation, including by not limited to a continuously stirred tank reactor or a tubular reactor. In some embodiments, the reactor is an adiabatic reactor, and/or an isothermal reactor. In some embodiments, the reactor pressure is constant. In some embodiments, the reactor pressure varies as the reaction progresses. In some embodiments, the reactor temperature varies as the reaction progress. In some embodiments, the reaction is performed in a batch operation. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the temperatures, pressures, catalyst ratios, concentrations of reactants, catalyst and solvents, flow rates can all be optimized or varied to achieve a given reaction outcome. In some embodiments, the reaction is maintained for a period of time sufficient to allow complete, near complete reaction of the epoxide to beta-lactone or as complete as possible based on the reaction kinetics and or reaction conditions. In some embodiments, the reaction time is established as a residence time within the reactor. The reaction can be halted by reducing the reactor temperature or pressure, withdrawing a particular reactant or introducing a quenching compound. The reaction may be halted at any point or any percentage conversion of epoxide to beta-lactone. E.g., the reaction may be halted when 50% of the epoxide is converted to beta-lactone. In one embodiment of the method, the epoxide comprises ethylene oxide, which is combined with carbon monoxide and reacted over a cobalt-based catalyst or precatalyst, such as dicobalt octacarbonyl, cobalt nitrate, cobalt acetate, cobalt chloride, or similar compounds, on a support consisting of silica gel, alumina, a zeolite or polymeric material, at a temperature of 50-200° C. and a pressure of 10-200 atmospheres to produce beta propiolactone. The reaction, being run with an excess of carbon monoxide, can result in almost total depletion of ethylene oxide. The less volatile beta propiolactone can be separated from unreacted carbon monoxide vapor stream by condensation and then fed directly to the next step. In another alternative, if the carbonylation reaction is run to the complete depletion of ethylene oxide, the entire effluent mixture of carbon monoxide containing the product beta propiolactone can be fed directly to the next step in a gaseous phase. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to operate the first reaction zone of the process in a series of stages. In one such embodiment, the first reaction zone (e.g., carbonylation) is separated into a plurality of individual reaction zones wherein each reaction zone achieves partial conversion of the epoxide in the feedstream to beta lactone. The unreacted epoxide and carbon monoxide exiting one reaction zone is then fed to the inlet of the next reaction zone. In certain embodiments, beta lactone formed in one stage is partially or wholly removed from the reaction stream prior to feed of the next stage. In this way, a balance can be achieved between consumption of epoxide feedstock and formation of lactone-derived byproducts since under some conditions higher conversion leads to greater formation of undesired byproducts. In certain embodiments, the individual reaction zones within the reactor are separated by a lower temperature zone from which the lactone condenses and is separated from the reaction stream before it enters the next reaction zone. In certain embodiments, the individual reaction zones in such a reactor decrease in size such that each stage is sized to efficiently accommodate the fraction of unreacted epoxide exiting the prior stage from which it is fed. In certain embodiments, the carbonylation reaction zone comprises between 2 and 20 individual reaction stages. In embodiments, where lactone is separated between stages, the resulting plurality of lactone streams can each feed the lactone conversion stage of the process, or they can be combined into one stream. Carbonylation Reaction Products As described above, the primary reaction product of the carbonylation reaction is a beta-lactone. Additionally, the product stream may contain other reaction by-products, un-reacted reactants, as well as catalyst and solvent. In some embodiments, the un-reacted reactants include epoxide or carbon monoxide. As such, the reaction may not proceed to completion and may be considered a partial reaction. In some embodiments, the amount of un-reacted epoxide is sufficient to prevent the formation of a succinic anhydride, a potential carbonylation reaction byproduct. Without being bound by a particular theory, it is speculated that the second reaction converting the beta-lactone to succinic anhydride does not proceed, unless all of the epoxide is consumed. Thus, a remaining percent of the epoxide feed to the reactor that exits un-reacted appears to prevent the formation of succinic anhydride. In some embodiments, the product stream contains less than about 5% epoxide, less than about 3% epoxide, less than about 1% epoxide or less than about 0.1%. Note, all percentages are applicable on either a mole basis, weight basis, or volume basis, per reaction conditions may dictate. In some embodiments, by-product formation includes the formation of succinic anhydride. In some embodiments, by-product formation includes the formation of one or more of the following compounds: crotonaldehyde, acrylic acid, 1,4 dioxane, acrylic acid dimers and trimers, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2,5 hexandienal, 3-oxacaprolactone, diethylene glycol monoacrylate, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, diethylene glycol diacrylate, 5-valeroactone and/or 2,6-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-4-ol. Lactone Conversion Generally In the next stage of processes of the invention, the effluent from the carbonylation reaction zone is fed to a second reaction zone where the beta lactone is subjected to conditions that convert it to a compound selected from the group consisting of: an alpha beta unsaturated acid, an alpha beta unsaturated ester, an alpha beta unsaturated amide, and a polymer. The second reaction stage is alternately referred to herein as the beta lactone conversion stage. The beta lactone stream resulting from the carbonylation step is carried onto a lactone conversion step in a second reaction zone. The lactone conversion step is discussed in more detail below. The beta-lactone stream may optionally be processed in a number ways prior to the lactone conversion step. This processing can include, but is not limited to: heating, cooling, or compressing the stream; condensing the stream to a liquid state and carrying forward the liquid; adding a polymerization inhibitor to the stream; condensing selected components to a liquid state and carrying forward the remaining gaseous components; condensing selected components to a liquid state and carrying forward the liquefied components; scrubbing the stream to remove impurities; adding reactants/catalysts for lactone conversion reactions; and any combination of two or more of these. In certain embodiments, the beta lactone is first separated from more volatile components in the product stream exiting the first reaction zone by condensing it to a liquid. This is easily achieved by cooling the product stream and/or increasing the pressure. In other embodiments, the entire effluent of the carbonylation stage is carried to the second reaction stage without any separation stage. This embodiment is particularly applicable if all of the epoxide has been consumed in which case the product stream exiting the carbonylation stage comprises essentially beta lactone and carbon monoxide (optionally mixed with other gases or volatile compounds if they were present at the feed or generated in situ). Turning next to the lactone conversion step, the beta-lactone stream discussed above is carried onward to a second reaction zone to convert the beta lactone contained therein to any of several end products described in more detail below. As discussed above, in some embodiments, the beta-lactone stream may undergo additional processing steps between the carbonylation step and may enter the lactone conversion stage of the process as a gas or as a liquid. The lactone conversion step itself may be performed in either the gas phase or the liquid phase and may be performed neat, or in the presence of a carrier gas, solvent or other diluent. In certain embodiments, the lactone conversion step is performed in a continuous flow format. In certain embodiments, the lactone conversion step is performed in a continuous flow format in the gas phase. In certain embodiments, the lactone conversion step is performed in a continuous flow format in the liquid phase. In certain embodiments, the lactone conversion step is performed in a liquid phase in a batch or semi-batch format. The lactone conversion step may be performed under a variety of conditions. In certain embodiments, the reaction may be performed in the presence of one or more catalysts that facilitate one or more steps in the transformation of the beta lactone to the end product. In certain embodiments, the beta-lactone conversion stage is fed with a feed stream containing less than 5 percent epoxide (relative to beta lactone). In certain embodiments, the beta-lactone conversion stage is fed with a feed stream containing less than 2 percent epoxide. In certain embodiments, the beta-lactone conversion stage is fed with a feed stream containing less than 1 percent epoxide, less than 0.5 percent epoxide, less than 0.25 percent epoxide, less than 0.1 percent epoxide, or less than 0.05 percent epoxide. In certain embodiments, the beta-lactone conversion stage is fed with a feed stream containing essentially no unreacted epoxide. Note, all percentages are applicable on either a mole basis, weight basis, or volume basis, per reaction conditions may dictate. In certain embodiments, the beta lactone conversion step comprises a solid catalyst and the conversion is conducted at least partially in the gas stage. In certain embodiments, the solid catalyst in the beta lactone conversion stage comprises a solid acid catalyst. In certain embodiments, the beta lactone is introduced as a liquid and contacted with the solid catalyst and the carboxylic acid (e.g., acrylic acid) or acid derivative (e.g., acrylic acid derivative) is removed as a gaseous stream. In other embodiments, the beta lactone is introduced as a gas, contacted with the solid catalyst and acrylic acid or an acrylic acid derivative is removed as a gaseous stream. In a specific embodiment, a mixture of beta propiolactone and water are contacted with a solid acid catalyst and gaseous acrylic acid is withdrawn from the reaction zone. In certain embodiments, a mixture of beta propiolactone and a lower alcohol are contacted with a solid acid catalyst and gaseous acrylate ester is withdrawn from the reaction zone. In certain embodiments, the processes above are characterized in that the feed rates, reaction rates, and reactor sizes are scaled such that each subsequent stage in the process can utilize essentially all of the effluent from the previous stage. In certain embodiments, the methods include one or more steps of modulating one or more system parameters selected from the group consisting of: the ethylene and oxygen feed rates and/or ratios, the ethylene oxidation zone reaction temperature, the carbon monoxide feed rate, the carbonylation stage temperature, the carbonylation stage reaction pressure, the feed rate of one or more reactants entering the lactone conversion stage, the temperature and/or pressure of the lactone conversion stage, and a combination of any two or more of these parameters. In certain embodiments, this modulation of system parameters is performed such that the conversion rate per unit time of each stage matches that of the previous stage so that the effluent of the previous stage may be used directly to feed the subsequent stage. In certain embodiments, the methods include one or more steps of analyzing the effluent from one or more stages to assess its content. In certain embodiments, such analyzing steps include performing spectroscopy (e g infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, ultraviolet or visible light spectroscopy and the like), chromatography (e.g. gas or liquid chromatography). In certain embodiments, such analyses are performed in a flow-through or stop-flow mode that provides real-time data on the chemical composition of the effluent. In certain embodiments, such data are used to provide a prompt to adjust one or more of the system parameters described above. Carboxylic Acid Production In certain embodiments, the product of the beta lactone conversion stage is an alpha beta unsaturated carboxylic acid or ester. There are a number of options possible for the way in which beta lactones can undergo thermolysis or alcoholoysis to a carboxylic acid (e.g., acrylic acid) or an ester (e.g., acrylate esters), respectively. In one embodiment, beta propiolactone is fed directly to a reactor containing heated phosphoric acid, optionally including copper metal, a copper salt or other catalyst, to produce acrylic acid vapors that are continuously removed to avoid the formation of unwanted byproducts. The formation of acrylic acid can be run at atmospheric, super-atmospheric or sub-atmospheric pressures, at temperatures as high as 300° C. The acrylic acid produced is then condensed and purified by any of the methods known to one skilled in the art. Additional compounds useful in converting beta lactones to carboxylic acids include, but are not limited to sulfuric acid, zinc chloride, sodium bisulfate, boric acid, boric anhydride, phosphorus pentoxide as well as metallic catalysis such as, aluminum oxide, iron oxides, titanium oxides, etc.,. Further, basic catalysis may be use including calcium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, borax, disodium phosphate, etc.,. In certain embodiments, water may be added to this process to act as a catalyst. Without being bound by theory or limiting the scope of the present invention, it is believed water can aid this conversion by opening the beta lactone to form a beta hydroxy acid intermediate which then dehydrates to provide the desired alpha beta unsaturated acid and regenerate the water. The water may be added to the beta lactone stream before entering the second reaction zone, or it may be present in (or added independently to) the second reaction zone. In certain embodiments, the conversion of beta propiolactone to acrylic acid is performed using methods such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,176,042, 2,485,510, 2,623,067, 2,361,036 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. In other embodiments, the acrylate production may be base catalyzed, see for example Journal of Organic Chemistry, 57(1), 389-91(1992) and references therein, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. Many catalysts known in the art can be used, or adapted for this step. In some embodiments, conditions include reaction with dehydrating agents such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or esters thereof as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,352,641; 2,376,704; 2,449,995; 2,510,423; 2,623,067; 3,176,042, and in British Patent No. GB 994,091, the entirety of each of which is incorporated herein by reference. In other embodiments, the lactone can be reacted with a halogenic compound to yield a beta halo acid, beta halo ester, or beta halo acid halide, which may then undergo dehydrohalogenation and/or solvolysis to afford the corresponding acrylic acid or acrylic ester. In certain embodiments, conditions disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,422,728 (incorporated herein by reference) are used in this process. Similarly, several methods can be employed to convert a beta lactone to an alpha beta unsaturated ester. For example, most methods use an alcohol in the beta lactone conversion stage (or added to the beta lactone stream before it is fed to this stage) to facilitate ring opening of the beta lactone to a beta hydroxy ester, or beta alkoxy acid, both of which can convert to alpha beta unsaturated esters. In certain embodiments, the lactone conversion step is performed in the presence of an alcohol. In certain embodiments, the lactone conversion step is performed in the presence of a C1-20 alcohol. In certain embodiments, the lactone conversion step is performed in the presence of a C1-8 alcohol. In certain embodiments, the lactone conversion step is performed in the presence of an alcohol selected from the group consisting of: methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, hexanol, and 2-ethyl-hexanol. In some embodiments, the alcohol used is a heptyl alcohol, an octyl alcohol, a nonyl alcohol, an n-decyl alcohol, an n-undecyl alchol, a cetyl alcohol, an n-coded alchol, an n-tetradecyl alcohol and other primary alcohols. Further, other alcohols can be used in the beta propiolactone conversion step, for example, sec-butyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol, allyl alcohol, beta-ethoxy-ethyl alcohol, diethylene glycol monoethyl either, cycloheanol, furfuryl alcohol benzyl alcohol, and ethylene glycol among others as described above. The beta lactone conversion is generally performed in the presence of a catalyst. For example, in some embodiments, the beta lactone is reacted with an alcohol in the presence of a dehydrating catalyst. Exemplary dehydrating catalysts include, but are not limited to: metal oxides (e.g., aluminum oxides, titanium oxides), zeolites, silica, and alumino-silicates, among others. Typically, such a conversion is performed in the liquid phase, and the product esters are isolated by distillation. In some embodiments, the beta lactone conversion can be performed with activated carbon as a catalyst to produce alpha beta unsaturated esters. In some embodiments, the beta lactone is reacted with an alcohol in the gas phase and over an activated carbon catalyst to produce esters. The activated carbon can be supplied in any form, for example, powdered, granulated, extruded, beads, impregnated with other elements (e.g., iodine, silver, metallic cations, etc.). In some embodiments, the reaction may include a polymerization inhibitor to prevent the formation of polymers. Exemplary polymerization inhibitors include copper, copper salts, hydroquinone, manganese, manganese salts, chromium, and chromium salts. As described above, the beta lactone conversion step can be operated within a variety of temperature and pressure ranges when alpha beta unsaturated carboxylic acid or ester are the desired products.

Polymerization In another embodiment of the present invention, the beta lactone from the carbonylation step is fed into a subsequent stage comprising a polymerization catalyst. This provides the opportunity to produce biodegradable polyesters such as poly(3-hydroxy butyrate) (P-3HB), and poly(propiolactone) without the need to handle and transport beta lactones. Many catalysts are known for the ring-opening polymerization of lactones (such as caprolactone and beta lactones). Any such catalyst can be employed in the present process.

In certain embodiments, the system comprises: a first reactor, comprising an inlet fed by an epoxide source and a carbon monoxide source; a catalyst bed comprising one or more metal carbonyl compounds; and a reactor outlet which provides an outlet stream comprising a beta lactone; anda second reactor comprising an inlet fed by the outlet stream of the first reaction zone; a catalyst bed comprising an acid catalyst where the water and the beta lactone are reacted to provide an alpha beta unsaturated acid; and a reactor outlet which provides a product stream comprising alpha beta unsaturated acid.

In another embodiment, the present invention provides systems for the synthesis of polyesters. In certain embodiments, the system comprises: a first reactor, comprising an inlet fed by an epoxide source and a carbon monoxide source; a catalyst bed comprising one or more metal carbonyl compounds; and a reactor outlet which provides an outlet stream comprising a beta lactone; anda second reactor comprising a first inlet fed by the outlet stream of the first reaction zone; a catalyst solution comprising a polymerization catalyst and a solvent, and a reactor outlet, which provides a product stream comprising a solution of polyester polymer. Some of the optional but non-limiting configurations of the processes described above are shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. In FIG. 1, carbon monoxide (1) and an epoxide (e.g., ethylene oxide (2)) are mixed and fed the carbonylation reactor (3) which contains a supported catalyst (e.g., cobalt catalyst). The configuration of the reactor can take many forms, as one skilled in the art recognizes, including a catalyst bed or catalyst filled tubes, which are situated within containing vessels, etc. Provision for heat transfer, temperature and pressure control, etc., are details that are not included but as one skilled in the art would recognized, are a vital part of any reactor system design. The product gas (4) contains unreacted carbon monoxide and product beta lactone (e.g., beta propiolactone). In a particular mode of operation, the reaction is run with a large excess of carbon monoxide, the effluent gas (4) contains no (or only minor amounts of) residual unreacted epoxide. The effluent gas (4) is then fed directly to the thermolysis reactor (5) which contains a suitable catalyst for the conversion of the beta lactone (e.g., beta propiolactone) to a carboxylic acid (e.g., acrylic acid). For example, the thermolysis reactor could be a vessel containing a hot phosphoric acid/catalyst solution at a suitable temperature and pressure that acrylic acid is produced. As the acid is formed, it is removed as a vapor product, which is subsequently separated by known methods into gaseous stream containing mainly unreacted carbon monoxide (9), and a crude carboxylic acid product (10) which would undergo further purification to the required specifications by methods well known to those in the field. Alternately, thermolysis reactor could comprise a heterogeneous catalyst such as a solid supported acid and the conversion of beta lactone (e.g., beta propiolactone) to a carboxylic acid (e.g., acrylic acid) can be performed with the lactone and the carboxylic acid substantially in the gas phase. A purge stream (8) taken from the thermolysis reactor provides a way of preventing the buildup of heavy byproducts and spent catalyst. Make-up catalyst (not shown in FIG. 1) would periodically be added to replenish the reaction medium. FIG. 2 shows another configuration, similar to FIG. 1, but includes provision for separating unreacted carbon monoxide and epoxide (e.g., ethylene oxide) (6) between the carbonylation reactor (3) and the thermolysis reactor (8) by means of a condensation step (5) using processing equipment well known to those skilled in the art. For this case, the reaction of carbon monoxide (1) and ethylene oxide (2) in the carbonylation reactor (3) does not necessarily go to the complete reaction of ethylene oxide. Condensed beta lactone (e.g., beta propiolactone) (7) is fed directly to the thermolysis reactor (8) for the conversion to acrylic acid in a manner analogous to that explained in the configuration of FIG. 1. As would be typical of such processes, there would still be provision for the purging of light gaseous products (12), the separation of a crude acrylic acid (13) for further purification to the required specification and the purging of heavy byproducts and spent catalyst (11). FIGS. 1 and 2 are just illustrative but not limiting to the depiction of possible configurations of the invention. The benefits of this invention include the ability to produce valued industrial products, such as acrylic acid and acrylic esters, from carbon monoxide, a reactant that can be derived from any number of feedstocks, including natural gas, oil, coal, biomass or waste products, in an efficient manner without the potential for personal or environmental harm associated with previous efforts to utilize this overall route.
