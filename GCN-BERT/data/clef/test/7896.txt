TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to the field of traditional Chinese medicine, and particularly to a beautyberry total glycosides extract and a preparation method and use thereof. BACKGROUND ART Beautyberry is a generic term of plants of the genus Callicarpa, family Verbenaceae, which has a variety of species, about 35 of them in China, and has extensive distribution. Ingredients contained in beautyberry are mainly flavonoid, terpenoid, phenylethanoid glycosides and volatile oils, and the like. Phenethyl alcohol glycosides are chemical ingredients with high concentration in beautyberry. Phenylethanoid glycosides are also known as phenylpropanoid glycoside compounds because they are mainly hydrocinnamoyl aglucon. It has been reported that the phenylethanoid glycosides have pain-relief, antisepsis, and antiphlogosis, antitumor, antiviral, antioxidation, hepatoprotection, and base repair effects. Phenylethanoid glycosides have evident amelioration effects on diabetes, related diseases, low learning capacity, and the like. With intensive studies on the phenylethanoid glycoside ingredients in recent years, more reports indicate that phenylethanoid glycoside compounds have effects in prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, and particularly in amelioration of senile dementia, Parkinson's disease. Chinese patent application No. CN200710040195.2 reports preparation of a broomrape total glycosides (phenylethanoid glycoside ingredients) extract from broomrape, and reports use of the extract in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Chinese patent CN201010146367.6 discloses preparation of an extract with forsythiaside B and verbascoside as main characteristic ingredients from aerial parts of Callicarpa kochiana, and discloses use of the extract in drugs for treating senile dementia. However, broomrape is an endangered and rare traditional Chinese medicinal material with limited production. Callicarpa kochiana is based on wild types and has low production. Concentration of phenylethanoid glycoside ingredients in the two medicinal materials is low, so that preparation of phenylethanoid glycoside ingredients with broomrape and Callicarpa kochiana as raw materials suffers from high costs of production, and thus is not suitable for sustained development. Therefore, preparation of drugs for treating diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases from medicinal materials having abundant resources, low prices and high contents of phenylethanoid glycoside substances is desirable. In addition, because phenylethanoid glycoside substances have wide pharmacological activity, new efficacy and therapeutic effects of the phenylethanoid glycoside substances are also worthy of further development. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An objective of the present invention is to provide a beautyberry total glycosides extract derived from Callicarpa cathayana H.T.Chang or Callicarpa formosana Rolfe. The extract has phenylethanoid glycoside ingredients verbascoside and Arenarioside as characteristic active ingredients, and has therapeutic efficacy against neurodegenerative diseases.

Callicarpa cathayana H.T.Chang and Callicarpa formosana Rolfe are two relatively common species of Callicarpa plants with distribution in Guizhou, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Hubei, Guangxi, Yunnan provinces and the like. Both species have large-scale cultivation, and are important sources of local revenue. Studies performed by the present inventors show that, the leaves of these two beautyberry species contain about 2% to 6% verbascoside and 1% to 4% Arenarioside. The concentrations of phenylethanoid glycosides in different beautyberry medicinal materials are analyzed by the present inventors through the following chromatographic methods: 1. Preparation method for the test samples: 0.25 g of powder (sieved through a gauge 3 screen) of dried leaves of a test beautyberry medicinal material is weighed precisely, into which is added 25 mL of a 70 (v/v) % methanol aqueous solution. The mixture is weighed, subjected to ultrasonic extraction for 20 min, then set cold, and compensated by a 70 (v/v) % methanol aqueous solution. The supernatant is taken, filtered, and the filtrate is taken for later use. 2. Chromatographic condition: Chromatographic column: a Cholester chromatographic column (4.6 * 250 mm, 5 µm); column temperature: 40°C; detector: a UV-detector (for example, VWD or DAD); detection wavelength: 332 nm; flow rate: F = 1.0 ml/min; sample amount: 10 µL; mobile phase A: 0.1 (v/v) % formic acid - water, B: acetonitrile; elution gradient: Time (min)A (v/v %)B (v/v %)09010408020450100500100 Typical HPLC (using the DAD detector) chromatograms of the beautyberry total glycosides extracts of the present invention from Callicarpa cathayana H.T.Chang leaves and Callicarpa formosana Rolfe leaves are seen in Figs. 1 and 2.

Animal grouping and dosage 70 mice were randomly divided into 7 groups, which were a blank control group, a model group, a Callicarpa kochiana total glycosides group (300 mg/kg), a high dose group (300 mg/kg) and a low dose group (100 mg/kg) of the beautyberry total glycosides extract of Example 6 of the present invention, a high dose group (300 mg/kg) and a low dose group (100 mg/kg) of the beautyberry total glycosides extract of Example 7 of the present invention, respectively. Each drug test group was continuously dosed by gastric lavage for 30 days, 0.25 mL each time, and the blank control group and the model group were continuously dosed with an equal amount of normal saline by lavage for 30 days. 3. Establishment and test of a model of scopolamine induced memory acquisition disorder in mice Mice were trained 1 h after administration of drugs on the 29th day of the dosing perioed. At 15 min before the training, 1 mg/kg scopolamine was intraperitoneally injected into each animal in each experimental group except the blank control group and 1 mg/kg normal saline was intraperitoneally injected in the blank control group. For the training mice waere first placed into a response chamber of the step down instrument for environmental adaptation for 3 min. Then 36 V alternating current was switched on immediately. Most of the mice jumped on the elevated platform after subjecting to electric shock to escape from the electric shock, and mice that had jumped down from the jumping platform would jump again back onto the jumping platform upon electric shock. The training was lasted for 5 min. Test was performed after 24 h, i.e., the last day of the dosing period, wherein the mice were placed on the jumping platform, the time (latency T) when a mouse jumped down from the elevated platform for the first time, as well as the number (error number N) of electric shock experienced within 5 min were recorded. Statistical treatment: all data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (x±s), comparison among groups was carried out by T-test, and significance of the difference was determined by variance analysis (if p< 0.05, there is difference, and if P < 0.01, there is significant difference). 4. Results As shown in Figs. 13 and 14, mice in the model group have significantly shortened latency (p < 0.05) and significantly increased error number (p < 0.05), as compared with the blank control group, suggesting that disorders had occurred in learning and memory acquisition of the mice after scopalamine treatment. For the Callicarpa kochiana total glycosides group (300 mg/kg), the latency increased (P < 0.05) and the error number decreased (p < 0.05) as compared with the model group. In the high dose group (300 mg/kg) and the low dose group (100 mg/kg) of the beautyberry total glycosides extract of Example 6 in the present invention, the latency significantly increased (p < 0.01), and the error number significantly decreased (P < 0.01) compared to the model group. In the high dose group (300 mg/kg) of the beautyberry total glycosides extract of Example 7 in the present invention, the latency tested of the mice can be significantly increased (P < 0.01), and the error number can be significantly reduced (P < 0.01), as compared with the model group. In the low dose group (100 mg/kg) of the beautyberry total glycosides extract of Example 7 in the present invention, the latency tested of the mice can be increased (p < 0.05), and the error number can be reduced (P < 0.05). The high dose group (300 mg/kg) of the high-concentration beautyberry total glycosides extract of Example 6 in the present invention has a better effect as compared with the Callicarpa kochiana total glycosides group (300 mg/kg) (P < 0.05).
