4-Iodo-1,2-dimethylbenzene (12.9 g, 55.6 mmol) was charged into the reaction flask with dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (D6-DMSO)(60 ml, 857 mmol) followed by sodium tert-butoxide (1.8 g, 18.75 mmol). This mixture was degassed with nitrogen then was stirred at 65° C. for 18 hours. The reaction was cooled down and quenched with 75 mL of D2O. This mixture was stirred at room temperature (˜22° C.) for 45 minutes. The mixture was then diluted with 200 mL of water and was extracted with 3×70 mL of dichloromethane (DCM). These extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude residue was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel eluted with DCM/heptanes 95/5 (v/v). Pure fractions were combined and concentrated under vacuum yielding 4-iodo-1,2-bis(methyl-d3)benzene (12.1 g, 50.8 mmol, 91% yield).
