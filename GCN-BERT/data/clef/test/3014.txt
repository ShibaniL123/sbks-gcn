FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates generally to the field of medical imaging, and in particular to radiographic imaging apparatus. More specifically, the invention relates to a mobile radiography apparatus having additional tomosynthesis capability. BACKGROUND Digital X-ray tomosynthesis is an imaging technique that enables three-dimensional imaging of a patient using a large-area digital detector typically used for conventional (single projection) radiography. A finite number of projection images over a limited angular range, typically between 20° and 40°, are acquired by varying the orientations of the x-ray tube, patient and detector. This is usually accomplished by either moving both the detector and x-ray source or by fixing the position of the detector (source) and moving the x-ray source (detector). In applications where the detector is fixed, multiple spatially distributed X-ray sources may be used or movable sources may be displaced in various patterns or trajectories. Three-dimensional data is reconstructed from the captured projections in the form of a number of slices through the patient anatomy, each parallel to the detector plane. A consequence of limited angular scanning is that the in depth resolution is much lower than the in-plane resolution of the reconstructed object.

Another aspect of the application is to provide methods and/or apparatus embodiments by which mobile radiography carts can acquire projections images, and then an imaging geometry and tomosynthesis reconstruction(s) can be simultaneously determined by iteratively determining an imaging geometry while iteratively monitoring a metric (e.g., stopping criterion) that approaches a prescribed or desired value associated with the tomosynthesis reconstruction.

DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS Portable radiographic systems are routinely used in hospitals. Compared to standard projection radiography, tomosynthesis provides improved depiction of fine details not visible in normal radiographs due to overlying structures. These benefits provide the impetus to develop portable tomosynthesis systems that can be utilized in the intensive care unit, emergency department, and operating rooms where moving patient is either impracticable or ill advised due to the risk of doing further damage to the patient. The image quality of the reconstruction depends upon the accurate knowledge of the acquisition scan geometry, the position of the x-ray source and detector for each projection. Uncertainties in the scan geometry can lead to artifacts and/or blurring in the reconstructed object. The development of portable tomosynthesis systems have been hampered by the difficulties in accurately determining the acquisition scan geometry. There remains a need for improved X-ray tomosynthesis systems that can be made portable and still provide reliable clinical images and data. The following is a description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference being made to the drawings in which the same reference numerals identify the same elements of structure in each of the several figures. Where they are used, the terms “first”, “second”, and so on, do not necessarily denote any ordinal or priority relation, but may be used for more clearly distinguishing one element or time interval from another. FIG. 1 is a diagram that shows a perspective view of a mobile radiography unit that can use portable radiographic detectors or flat panel detectors according to embodiments of the application. The exemplary mobile x-ray or radiographic apparatus of FIG. 1 can be employed for digital radiography (DR) and/or tomosynthesis. As shown in FIG. 1, a mobile radiography apparatus 100 can include a moveable transport frame 120 that includes a first display 110 and an optional second display 110′ to display relevant information such as obtained images and related data. As shown in FIG. 1, the second display 110′ can be pivotable mounted at the x-ray source 140 to be viewable/touchable from a 360 degree area. The displays 110, 110′ can implement or control (e.g., touch screens) functions such as generating, storing, transmitting, modifying, and printing of an obtained image(s) and can include an integral or separate control panel (not shown) to assist in implementing functions such as generating, storing, transmitting, modifying, and printing of an obtained image(s). For mobility, the mobile radiographic apparatus 100 can have one or more wheels 115 and one or more handle grips 125, typically provided at waist-level, arm-level, or hand-level, that help to guide the mobile radiographic apparatus 100 to its intended location. A self-contained battery pack (e.g., rechargeable) can provide source power, which can reduce or eliminate the need for operation near a power outlet. Further, the self-contained battery pack can provide for motorized transport. For storage, the mobile radiographic apparatus 100 can include an area/holder for holding/storing one or more digital radiographic (DR) detectors or computed radiography cassettes. The area/holder can be storage area 130 (e.g., disposed on the frame 120) configured to removably retain at least one digital radiography (DR) detector. The storage area 130 can be configured to hold a plurality of detectors and can also be configured to hold one size or multiple sizes of DR detectors. Mounted to frame 120 is a support column 135 that supports an x-ray source 140, also called an x-ray tube, tube head, or generator that can be mounted to the support member 135. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the support member (e.g., column 135) can include a second section that extends outward a fixed/variable distance from a first section where the second section is configured to ride vertically up and down the first section to the desired height for obtaining the image. In addition, the support column is rotatably attached to the moveable frame 120. In another embodiment, the tube head or x-ray source 140 can be rotatably coupled to the support column 135. In another exemplary embodiment, an articulated member of the support column that bends at a joint mechanism can allow movement of the x-ray source 140 over a range of vertical and horizontal positions. Height settings for the x-ray source 140 can range from low height for imaging feet and lower extremities to shoulder height and above for imaging the upper body portions of patients in various positions. As shown in FIG. 2, for ease during transport of the mobile radiographic apparatus 100, the support member 135 and x-ray source 140 can be arranged close to frame 120. As shown in FIG. 2, the second display 110′ can be in a viewable position (e.g., operable) during transport of the mobile radiographic apparatus 100. When the mobile radiographic apparatus 100 is to be used, the support member 135 and x-ray source 140 can be extended from the frame 120 for proper positioning (e.g., by the operator, a user, or x-ray technician) and the second display 110′ moved to viewable position such as shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 3 is a diagram that shows an exemplary embodiment of a display/monitor as a second display mounted to a boom assembly of a mobile radiography unit according to the application. As shown in FIG. 3, the second display 110′ can be mounted to a collimator 345 of an x-ray source 340 of a support member 135 of a mobile radiography unit. In one embodiment, the collimator 345 can be rotably mounted to the x-ray source 340 so that the collimator 345 (e.g., second display 110′) can swivel at least 90 degrees, at least 180 degrees or 360 degrees. As shown in FIG. 3, the second display 110′ is coupled to a plurality of handles for ease of positioning. Alternatively, the second display 110′ can be mounted to (e.g., rotatably) an x-ray source 340 above a collimator 345 of a boom assembly of a mobile radiography unit. FIG. 4 is a diagram that illustrates an embodiment of a sign on screen according to the application. Thus, when an attempt is made to operate the mobile x-ray imaging apparatus 100, a sign on screen 410 can be displayed to provide instructions to a user. As shown in FIG. 4, the single sign on screen 410 can provide instructions for sign on sign on and activate the mobile x-ray system 100 such as “LOGIN: Please scan your badge or type User Name and Password at the main screen.” Exemplary embodiments of a pass key or ID badge can include but are not intended to be limited to a card reader such as a smart card, a magnetic stripe card, bar code data, or a proximity reader compatible with access technologies such as RFID, bluetooth, wireless communication device, a proximity card, a wireless smart card, a wiegand card, a magnetic reader device/card, an optical reader device/card, an infrared reader device/card, or biometric data such as fingerprints, eye scan or the like.

According to embodiments of the application, the first display 110 and the second display 110′ can provide capabilities/functionality to the mobile x-ray imaging apparatus 100 such as but not limited to: (i) view and/or change x-ray exposure parameters, tube/generator/technique settings; (ii) view and/or change image information, such as a list of views (e.g., body part & projection) to perform for the patient, relevant information about those views, the ability to select a view to perform, and an x-ray image of an acquired view; (iii) display and/or change patient information, such as: Patient Name, Room number, Patient ID, date of birth (e.g., to confirm that the correct patient); (iv) display and/or change a Patient Worklist, such as a list of exams to perform and allow the user to select an exam. (In one embodiment, such a patient worklist can be automatically updated (e.g., synchronized to a master/hospital/doctor worklist) using a wired or wireless network/connection. In one embodiment, the mobile x-ray imaging apparatus 100 can highlight/indicate new exams (e.g., on the second display 110′) upon receipt of the scheduled examination.); (v) display generator/source current values and controls to change those values, such as: kVp, mA, mAs, Time, ECF, focal spot, collimator, filter, AEC, grid; (vi) display detector selection and allow the technician to select/activate a different detector; (vii) display recently acquired images and allow editing of those images, exemplary acquired (e.g., recently) or previous images can be displayed full size, partial size or with corresponding image information; (viii) display previously acquired images (e.g., related prior images of a patient) and allow editing of those images; or (ix) display a video of what is in front of the mobile x-ray imaging apparatus 100 during transport, e.g., using a video camera located on the other side (e.g., front side of the mobile x-ray imaging apparatus 100). In one embodiment, the mobile x-ray system 100 can include a collision avoidance system with alerts (e.g., audible, visual), and automatic maneuvering to avoid contact in the examining room (e.g., by stopping or course modification). FIGS. 5-8 are diagrams that illustrate exemplary non-limiting representative functions illustrated on an embodiment of a second display of a mobile x-ray imaging apparatus. As shown in FIG. 5, an example of a work list is shown on a monitor of the second display 110′.

In one embodiment, the mobile radiographic imaging apparatus can be operated/controlled by programmed control logic in the first or second displays. For example, the programmed control logic can include a processor and display, an integrated computer system, or a portable computer and applications to operate thereon. FIG. 9 is a diagram that shows a perspective view of a mobile radiography unit according to another embodiment of the application. FIG. 10 is a diagram that shows a perspective view of a mobile radiography unit that can provide a tomosynthesis capability according to embodiments of the application. In one embodiment, a mobile radiography unit that be a tomosynthesis system. As shown in FIG. 10, an embodiment of a portable tomosynthesis system 1000 is shown that can include a movable transport frame 1020. Mounted to the moveable transport frame 1020 can be a support column that supports an x-ray source 1040. As shown in FIG. 10, a support column 1030 can include a second section 1030b that extends outward a fixed/variable distance from a first section 1030a where the second section 1030b is configured to ride vertically up and down the first section 1030a to the desired height for obtaining the projection images. The system also includes a digital x-ray detector 1050 that is wirelessly connected to a system controller 1015 contained inside the moveable transport frame 1020. The system controller 1015 can implement and/or control the functionality of the mobile radiographic unit 1000 (e.g., functionality provided through the displays 100, 100′). The system controller 1015 can be provided though one or more of a conventional general purpose processor, digital computer, microprocessor, RISC processor, signal processor, CPU, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), video digital signal processor (VDSP) and/or similar computational machines, programmed according to the teachings of the application, as will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art(s). The x-ray source 1040 can use a collimator to form beams that are directed towards the detector 1050. The x-ray source 1040 may also include positioning, such as motors, which allow for directing the beam towards the detector. The moveable transport frame 1020 can include a first display 1010 and the x-ray source 1040 can be coupled to a second optional display 1010′. The system controller 1015 can coordinate operations of the x-ray source 1040, detector 1050, and moveable transport frame 1020. The system controller 1015 can control operations of the x-ray source, which may include the collimator, positioning devices and triggering of image acquisition by emission of x-rays from the source. The system controller 1015 also can control operations of the detector 1050, which may include triggering of the image acquisition and transmission of the acquired images back to the controller. In addition, the system controller 1015 can control the movement of the transport frame 1020. FIG. 10 shows an embodiment of a portable tomosynthesis system where the x-ray source 1040 assembly can be moved along a prescribed path relative to the detector 1050 or relative to geometry of the detector 1050 and/or a patient (object) to be imaged. As shown in FIG. 10, the moveable transport frame 1020 can move the x-ray source 1040 assembly along a prescribed path (e.g., linear/non-linear motion) illustrated by an arrow. FIGS. 11A-11B are diagrams that show perspective views of additional mobile radiography units that can provide tomosynthesis capabilities according to embodiments of the application. As shown in FIG. 11A, the support column 1030 can move the x-ray source 1040 assembly along a prescribed path (e.g., linear/non-linear, curved, 2D or 3D) illustrated by an arrows. In certain exemplary embodiments, the second section 1030b and/or the first section 1030a can independently move the x-ray source 1040 assembly or move the x-ray source 1040 assembly in combination (e.g., concurrently). Further, the moveable transport frame 1020 can move the x-ray source 1040 assembly in combination with the support column 1030. In one embodiment, the mobile radiography units that can include a tomosynthesis capability as shown in FIG. 11B can further be used for LLI (Long Length Imaging). FIG. 12 is a diagram that shows a perspective view of another mobile radiography unit that can provide a tomosynthesis capability according to embodiments of the application. In one embodiment of a portable tomosynthesis system, an x-ray source assembly can be configured to move along a prescribed path (e.g., linear path). FIG. 12 shows an embodiment of a portable tomosynthesis system where the x-ray source 1040 assembly is replaced by an X-ray source 1240 designed to move along a linear path on a support track 1260. FIG. 13 is a diagram that shows a perspective view of another mobile radiography unit that can provide a tomosynthesis capability according to embodiments of the application. In certain exemplary embodiment of portable tomosynthesis systems, the moveable mounted x-ray source can be replaced by a plurality of multiple individually controlled x-rays sources. FIG. 13 shows an embodiment of a portable tomosynthesis system where the multiple individually controlled x-rays sources are distributed sources (e.g., linearly distributed). The distributed sources can be arrayed in a prescribed spatial relationship. Alternatively, different x-ray source paths can be used to modify or address reconstruction artifacts that can be caused by limited angular scanning systems such as radiographic tomosynthesis imaging systems. In addition, various x-ray scan paths can be use to accentuate the desired imaged structures and/or reduce or minimize artifacts that might confound or mask the ability to make an accurate diagnosis. FIG. 17 is a diagram that shows examples of non-linear x-ray scan paths (e.g., circular and square paths). In one embodiment, the moveable x-ray source is mounted on a circular 1710 (square 1730) track or a plurality of sources are spatially distributed in a circular 1720 (square 1740) pattern. However, embodiments of the application are not intended to be so limited, for example other non-linear, curved, 2D or 3D scan paths or movable x-ray supports can be used. Further, source assemblies can be used to ensure that radiation emitted by the moveable or distributed x-ray source is directed towards the detector (e.g., through the object/patient). In one embodiment, the source assemblies can include adjustable collimators (e.g., before or during an image acquisition scan). In one embodiment, the adjustable collimators can be individually and/or concurrently moved. In one embodiment, a mobile radiographic imaging system is intended to support critically ill patients in an ICU that are currently transported out of ICU for x-ray imaging. For example, ICU patients can receive a tomosysthesis procedure that might otherwise be transported out of ICU in order to obtain a CT exam. For example, CT imaging is often needed for ICU patients in order to differentiate various types of fluids induced by plural effusions, such as blood, water, and the like, so that corrective actions can be taken. However, transporting ICU patients to the CT exam area can be a challenging task due to their severe clinical conditions. Further, visualization software can be provided to facilitate interpretation of ICU-related chest abnormalities. For instance, presentation of the low exposure sequences (prior to reconstruction of the slide data) that allows the ICU physician to “look around” rib structures and the like. Referring to FIG. 14a, a flow chart that shows an exemplary method of acquiring projections images and generating the reconstruction of three-dimensional tomosynthesis images, will now be described. The method for acquiring projections images and generating the reconstruction of three-dimensional tomosynthesis images will be described using embodiments of mobile radiography apparatus shown in FIGS. 10-13 and can be applied to mobile x-ray systems/carts shown in FIGS. 1 and 10-13; however, the method of FIG. 14a is not intended to be limited thereby. As shown in FIG. 14a, the detector and x-ray source can be positioned (operation block 1410). For example, the x-ray source can be moved to its initial position and the detector can be positioned such that the patient P is interposed between the detector and x-ray source. For exemplary portable tomosynthesis system embodiments 1000, 1200, 1300, the initial x-ray source assembly position can be set by the location of the transport frame and the support column. The height, extent and rotation positioning of the support column's first section 1030a and the second section 1030 can be used to position the x-ray source assembly to the initial desired location above the patient the patient. Alternatively, the support (e.g., support 1260, track 1710, track 1730) and the location of the transport frame and/or the support column can set the initial x-ray source assembly position. Then, a series of projections image can be acquired at different x-ray source positions (operation block 1420). In embodiment 1000, the projection images can be acquired while the transport frame, and thus attached x-ray source, is moved along a linear or non-linear path. In embodiment 1000, the projection images can be acquired while the height, extent, and rotation of the support columns first and second section are modulated so that the attached x-ray source, is moved along a linear or non-linear path. In embodiment 1200, the projection images can be acquired while the x-ray source is moved along the support track. In embodiment 1300, the projection images can be acquired while individual x-ray sources are triggered. Then, the acquired projection image data can be received (e.g., transfer back from the detector to) by control and processing components of the system controller (operation block 1430). The projections images can be displayed on display 110 and/or undergo a quality check (e.g., automated or by the operator) before being further processed. Then, the imaging geometry and the tomosynthesis reconstruction can be simultaneously determined by iteratively determining an imaging geometry (e.g., for source positions and detector position(s)) while iteratively monitoring a metric that approaches a prescribed or desired value (or change in value) associated with the tomosynthesis reconstruction (operation block 1440). For example, the imaging geometry and the tomosynthesis reconstruction can be simultaneously determined by establishing the imaging geometry that maximizes (or minimizes) a metric associated with the tomosynthesis reconstruction (operation block 1440). There are numerous metrics, such as image quality of the final reconstruction or data fidelity of the reconstruction to the measured projections, which can be used to determine the imaging geometry. Then, the reconstruction volume can be displayed on display 110, 110′ (operation block 1450) and/or undergo a quality check before storing the volume. In one embodiment, the reconstruction volume can be stored after the quality check (e.g., before display thereof). Examples of image quality metrics are metrics that are associated with edge (high frequency) information of the reconstruction, such as the gradient of the reconstructed object f (F) E 1 = 1 2  ∫ V   ∇ f  ( r → )  2    r → or the laplacian E 2 = 1 2  ∫ V   ∇ 2  f  ( r → )  2    r → . where r=(x, y, z) spatial location and V is the volume or sub volume of the reconstruction. Another type of image quality metric is associated with the probability distribution function (or normalized histogram) h(z) of the reconstructed object f (F) such as the power density [in-line-formulae]E3=∫zh2(w)dw [/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]or entropy[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]E4=−∫zh(w)log(h(w))dw [/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]where[/in-line-formulae] h  ( w ) = 1 V  ∫ V  K  ( f  ( r → ) - w )    r → is the nonparametric kernel density estimate of the probability distribution function of w, is the unit of reconstruction such as attenuation coefficient or Hounsfield unit, for a given kernel K( ). Typical choices for K( ) are the Dirac delta function and the Gaussian kernel. An example of a data fidelity metric is E 5 = 1 2  ∑ i = 1 nProjs   A i  f - p i  2 or a regularized version, E 6 = R  ( f ) + 1 2  ∑ i = 1 nProjs   A i  f - p i  2 where Ai is the projection matrix for the ith projection, f and p are vector representation of the reconstruction volume and projection images, and R( ) is a regularizer imposing a prior, such as smoothness, on the reconstruction f. The projection matrices A are a function of the imaging geometry. The image quality of the reconstruction depends upon the accurate knowledge of the position of the x-ray source and detector for each projection. Uncertainties in the scan geometry can lead to artifacts and/or blurring in the reconstruction. Further, accurate positioning of the detector using a grid can be desirable or fundamental to allow impinging x-ray to pass the grid to reach, in whole or in part, the detector. For a portable stationary detector tomosynthesis system, the scan geometry can correspond to the set x-ray source locations relative to the stationary detector. The position encoders associated with the moveable frame and moveable x-ray source assembly can provide accurate information about the spatial location of the x-ray source in a local coordinate system associated with the x-ray source assembly. For a distributed source assembly, the spatial location of x-ray sources can be fixed in the local coordinate system. For the portable tomosynthesis system, the detector and x-ray source are physically separated from each other, as a consequence the relative orientation and distance between x-ray source assembly and the detector local coordinates systems are not accurately known. In one exemplary embodiment, a detector can be physically separated and tethered to the portable tomosynthesis system, however, such system geometry (e.g., position, orientation etc. of detector, x-ray source(s)) can be unknown. FIG. 15 a and FIG. 15b are diagrams that schematically show exemplary relative orientation and distance between x-ray source coordinate system 1500 and the detector coordinate system 1530 for a linear scan tomosynthesis system. FIG. 15a shows a desired aligned tomosynthesis system (e.g., selected alignment or ideally aligned), where the detector and x-ray source coordinates have the same orientation. A projection 1525 of the trajectory 1510 of the x-ray source 1520 onto the detector 1540 is aligned with the one of the detector's in plane axes and the distance between the x-ray source and detector is constant along the x-ray source's trajectory. FIG. 15b shows a system where the detector and x-ray source coordinates have different orientations and as a result the distance of the x-ray source to the detector plane now varies along the x-ray source trajectory. As shown in FIG. 12, this type of mismatch in orientation between the x-ray source assembly 1060 and detector 1050 can occur when the detector 1050 is place under a bedridden patient. FIG. 14 b is a flow chart that shows an embodiment of a method to determine the imaging geometry/reconstruction step 1440 using an algorithm that can determine or optimize an image quality metric associated with a filtered backprojection reconstruction algorithm. An algorithm used to accomplish this can be referred to as an imaging geometry auto-correction reconstruction algorithm. In the filter projection operation block 1441, a current estimate of the imaging geometry can be used to generate the filtered projections. In the backproject filtered projections operation block 1442, the filtered projections can be backprojected using the current estimate of the imaging geometry to generate a current reconstruction. In calculate reconstruction image quality metric operation block 1443, an image quality metric such as L2 norm as defined by E1 is calculated for the current reconstruction. In the iterating complete operation block 1444, the optimization can be terminated if a stopping condition for image quality metric has been achieved; otherwise the process (e.g., optimization) continues. Examples of stopping condition can be the image quality metric has converged to maximum (or minimum) value, relative change in the metric is below a given threshold or a maximum number of iterations have been reached. One feature of the imaging geometry auto-correction reconstruction algorithm can be performed in the optimize image quality metric/update imaging geometry operation block 1445, where the image quality metric is optimized with respect to the imaging geometry. Exemplary optimization procedures can determine updates to the imaging geometry that achieve the desired (e.g., maximize or minimize) the image quality metric. Exemplary optimization procedures of the imaging geometry can be carried out over the whole or subset of the reconstruction. Exemplary subsets can be a set of axial slices or sub volumes of interest that are determined from the initial reconstruction using the assumed imaging parameters. Some commonly used optimization algorithms are downhill-simplex, Powell's method, and gradient descent methods. For example using a gradient descent method to optimize(maximize) the L2 norm of the reconstruction E1 E 1 =  1 2  ∫   ∇ f  ( r → )  2    r → =  1 2  ∫  ∇ f x 2  ( r → ) + ∇ f y 2  ( r → ) + ∇ f z 2  ( r → )   r → . The derivative of E1 with respect to the set of imaging parameters a is given by ∂ E 1 ∂ α = ∫  ∇ f x  ( r → )  ∂ ∇ f x  ( r → ) ∂ α + ∇ f y  ( r → )  ∂ ∇ f y  ( r → ) ∂ α + ∇ f z  ( r → )  ∂ ∇ f z  ( r → ) ∂ α   r → These derivatives can be determined either analytically or numerically using the filtered backprojection reconstruction algorithm. The derivatives are then used to update the current estimate αk to yield a new estimate αk+1 is given by α k + 1 = α k + δ k  ∂ E 1 ∂ α where δk is a step size which can either be a constant or an optimal step size can be calculated using a line search for each update. The imaging parameters can be the set or some subset of x-ray source locations {xsi,ysi,zsi} relative to the stationary detector for each projection image used in the reconstruction. Alternatively, if the distances between the x-ray source locations are known, as described above, then the imaging parameters correspond to the relative orientation and distance between x-ray source assembly and the detector. This corresponds to determining the set or subset of rigid motion parameters that convert the assumed nominal x-ray source positions to the positions in space that optimize the reconstruction metric. FIG. 16 is a diagram that shows an exemplary resulting orientation and distance of a linear track x-ray source assembly 1620 after applying rigid motion to the starting orientation and distance of a linear track x-ray source assembly 1610. The set rigid motion parameters can be the rotations θx, θy, and θz about and translations tx, ty, and tz along the detector's x, y, and z axes. It should be noted especially for the case where the imaging parameters correspond to the set of x-ray source locations that a regularizer can be added to the reconstruction metrics that will enforce that the selected or optimized x-ray source locations {xsi,ysi,zsi} yield a smooth trajectory. An example of such a regularizer is the L2 norm of the set of x-ray source locations ∑ i   ∇ xs i  2 +  ∇ ys i  2 +  ∇ zs i  2 . In the update filtered projection operation block 1446, if the current updated imaging geometry is significantly different from the imaging geometry used to filter the projections then the projection can be filtered using the current updated imaging geometry. The updated filtered projections can then be used in the next iteration(s) of the imaging geometry auto-correction reconstruction algorithm. FIG. 18 is a diagram that shows a slice of the tomosynthesis reconstruction for a linear track scan of a hand phantom using the assumed imaging geometry 1810, the optimized geometry 1820 as determined by one imaging geometry auto-correction reconstruction algorithm, and the actual imaging geometry 1830. For the assumed geometry the x-ray source assembly is translated 180 cm along the detector's z axis and has the same orientation as the detector 1610. The actual geometry corresponds to the linear track being rotated −3.9 degree about its x axis followed by a −3.9 degree rotation about its z axis from its assumed position. As shown in FIG. 18, tomosynthesis reconstruction results using the imaging geometry calculated from the auto-correction reconstruction algorithm and the actual imaging geometry are essentially indistinguishable. Various exemplary embodiments described herein can illustrate individual modes of operation. In certain exemplary embodiments, more than one mode can be provided in/by a single mobile radiographic imaging system and/or methods for using the same. Certain exemplary embodiments of mobile radiographic imaging systems and/or method for using the same can determine or use auto-correction reconstruction processes that can produce data in a unified coordinate system, for each image in a capture sequence that provides the relative x-ray source focal spot position and detector position and orientation. This information can have various multiple uses in tomosynthesis image reconstruction. For example, such information can be used in conjunction with X-ray exposure technique technical factors to estimate the signal the detector would receive with an “air exposure” (e.g., without any object/subject interposed between the source(s) and the detector). This “air exposure” image can be used in tomosynthesis reconstruction to provide the estimated linear attenuation coefficients for volumetric reconstruction processing. Further, a recovered geometry according to the application can also be used to apply tomosynthesis reconstruction approaches employing other methods such as SIRT, SART, ART or other methods known by those skilled in the art of volumetric reconstruction algorithms. In addition, recovered geometry can also be used in patient dose estimation.

As shown in FIG. 19, a mobile radiographic imaging system can include a first radiographic x-ray source and collimator, and a second x-ray source comprising a distributed source (e.g., rectangle) that can be either permanently attached or attached (detachable) when needed. FIG. 20 is a diagram that shows a mobile radiographic imaging systems that can include first and second (e.g., multiple) radiographic x-ray sources. As shown in FIG. 20, a mobile radiographic imaging system can include a first radiographic x-ray source and collimator, and a second x-ray source comprising a distributed source attachment (e.g., linear) that can be either permanently attached or attached (detachable) when needed. In one embodiment, the distributed sources can be on a curved support to maintain a single distance from a corresponding point on a detector. Exemplary distributed source attachment can have a first position for use and a second position for storage (e.g., folded) when not used. In one embodiment, exemplary distributed source attachments can have a first position for use, at least one intermediate position (e.g., half-unfolded) and a second position for storage (e.g., folded) when not used.
