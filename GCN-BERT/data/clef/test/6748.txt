Step 6: (1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl (S)-2-(4-(5-((4-(2-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)((R)-2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethyl)amino)ethyl)benzyl)carbamoyl)thiophen-2-yl)phenyl)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetate
A solution of (R)-(5-((4-(2-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)(2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-oxy)-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethyl)amino)ethyl)-benzyl)carbamoyl)thiophen-2-yl)boronic acid (35 mg, 0.048 mmol) in DMF (2 ml) was added with (1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl 2-hydroxy-2-phenyl-2-(4-(((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)oxy)phenyl)acetate (24.85 mg, 0.044 mmol), prepared as described in Procedure A Steps 1-2, followed by a solution K2CO3 2 M (16 ml). After stirring for 10 minutes, tetrakistriphenylphosphinepalladium (50 mg, 0.044 mmol) was added, and the resulting mixture was heated to 120Â° C. for 4 hours. The cooled-down mixture was treated with water and ethyl acetate (5 ml), the organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 then concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude was purified by flash chromatography (eluent-0 to 100% Ethyl acetate in Heptane) to obtain (1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl (S)-2-(4-(5-((4-(2-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)((R)-2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethyl)amino)ethyl)benzyl)carbamoyl)thiophen-2-yl)phenyl)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetate (47 mg, 19%).
