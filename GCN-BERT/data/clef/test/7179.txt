METHOD OF PRODUCING ORGANIC COMPOUNDS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a mixed culture of microorganisms, a method of using the mixed culture of microorganisms to produce organic compounds and a use of the mixed culture of microorganisms. In particular, the mixed culture of microorganisms comprises at least an acetogenic and a non-acetogenic microorganism. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The use of carbon dioxide as a carbon source for synthesis of organic compounds using a microbiological process is well known in the art. In general, the method comprises two complementary metabolic pathways one involving the production of acetate and/or ethanol and the other converting this acetate and/or ethanol to an organic compound. The methods known in the art try to combine these two complementary metabolic pathways from different organisms in a recombinant cell for production of the organic substance. This raises several problems as each organism used in the method is specialised and requires specific conditions to function and carry out the individual metabolic reaction. Combining these organisms to produce organic compounds is thus a difficult task as the organisms are not as efficient as they will not be able to work at optimal conditions. Accordingly, currently available methods of synthesising carbon sources to produce organic compounds use a two-step process where each organism is allowed to carry out its function in its optimal condition. These two-step processes usually use two chambers where each chamber has an organism in its optimal condition for carrying out the specific metabolic reaction and the product of the first chamber is transferred to the second chamber without the residual first organism. This process is cumbersome and usually more costly as a large part of the resultant product from the first chamber may be lost in the transfer process to the second chamber. This two-step process is also generally inefficient as it takes time to allow one metabolic pathway to be completed and transfer the first resultant product to the second chamber for the second metabolic pathway to be carried out. WO2013167663 and WO2013036147 both describe methods for production of specific hydrocarbons using a two-step process. There are alternative methods known and used where C02 is used as a carbon source by a microorganism which is known to be able to fix C02, through a specific selection of the fermentation parameters , so that a desired , simple organic substance , such as ethanol , n-butanol or 2,3 -butanediol is synthesized. For example, WO200068407 describes the use of acetogenic bacteria to produce ethanol and WO2012024522 uses acetogenic bacteria for the production of butanediol. However, most of the processes described have the disadvantage that the yields are low and the method is inefficient. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process which can overcome at least one disadvantage of the prior art. DESCRIPTON OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a mixed cell culture, method and use of the culture as defined in the claims. An advantage of the present invention may be that much more favorable C02/CO mixtures of raw materials can be used. These various sources include natural gas, biogas, coal, oil, plant residues and the like. Another advantage of the method may be the high carbon yield. This is made possible by the return of formed C02. Namely, the C02 can be reacted in the first stage back to acetic acid. Another advantage may lie in greater flexibility with regard to the fermentation conditions used, as any acetogenic and non-acetogenic microorganism may be used in combination for the actual production of unsaturated or saturated organic compounds. Another advantage of the present invention may be that since the acetogenic microorganism may function and/or produce acetate and/or ethanol in the presence of oxygen, both the acetogenic and non- acetogenic microorganisms may be present in a homogenous mixture for the production of substituted and/or unsubstituted organic compounds from a carbon source. This feature of the acetogenic microorganism enables the production of substituted and/or unsubstituted organic compounds from a carbon source to be a one step process making the process more efficient and the yield greater. Surprisingly, because of this advantage of the acetogenic microorganism, the one-step procedure for making organic compounds may be carried out in a single fermenter without an intermediate separation step. There may also be an increased concentration of the final product using this one step procedure. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a mixed culture of a first and second microorganism in an aqueous medium, wherein - the first microorganism may be an acetogenic microorganism and/or autotrophically growing cells capable of converting a carbon source comprising CO and/or C02 to acetate and/or ethanol; - the second microorganism may be a non-acetogenic microorganism capable of metabolising acetate and/or ethanol; and - the first and second microorganisms may be in a homogenous mixture and wherein the aqueous medium comprises oxygen. The term 'homogeneous mixture' as used herein refers to a mixture of the microorganisms distributed uniformly in a medium. In particular, the mixture may comprise at least two microorganisms, an acetogenic and a non-acetogenic microorganism distributed evenly in a medium. In one example, there may be approximately equal numbers of acetogenic and non-acetogenic microorganisms in the mixture. In another example, there may be more of the acetogenic microorganism compared to the non- acetogenic microorganism in the mixture. In yet another example, there may be more of the non- acetogenic microorganism compared to the acetogenic microorganism in the mixture. In all the possible examples, the microorganisms are in a single homogenous mixture where they are uniformly distributed throughout the mixture. The term "acetate" as used herein, refers to both acetic acid and salts thereof, which results inevitably, because as known in the art, since the microorganisms work in an aqueous environment, and there is always a balance between salt and acid present. The term "second microorganism" refers to a microorganism that is different from "the first microorganism" according to any aspect of the present invention. Accordingly, the first and second microorganisms are different according to any aspect of the present invention. According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of producing at least one organic compound, the method comprising contacting a mixed culture of a first and second microorganism in a homogenous mixture in an aqueous medium, with a carbon source and oxygen, wherein - the first microorganism is an acetogenic microorganism capable of converting a carbon source to acetate and/or ethanol; and the second microorganism is a non-acetogenic microorganism capable of metabolising acetate and/or ethanol to the organic compound. The aqueous medium according to any aspect of the present invention may comprise oxygen. The oxygen may be dissolved in the medium by any means known in the art. In particular, the oxygen may be present at a range of 0.1 to 3mg/l. In particular, the oxygen may be present at a range of the 0.1 to 2.5mg/l, 0.1 to 2 mg/l, 0.1 to 1.5 mg/l or 0.5 to 2.0 mg/l. In particular, the oxygen may be provided to the aqueous medium in a continuous gas flow. The oxygen concentration is the gas flow may be present at less than 21 % by weight of the total amount of gas in the gas flow. In particular, the oxygen may be present at a concentration range of 0.01 to 10 % by weight, at a range of 0.05 to 10 % by weight, 0.1 to 10 % by weight, 0.1 to 9 % by weight, 0.05 to 8 % by weight, particularly at a range of 0.05 to 6 % by weight. In particular, the acetogenic microorganism is particularly suitable when the proportion of 02 in the gas phase is between 0.05 % and 6 %. Even more in particular, the first and second microorganisms according to any aspect of the present invention are capable of working optimally in the aqueous medium when the oxygen is supplied by a gas flow with concentration of oxygen of less than 21 % by weight of the total gas, in the range of 0.05 to 6 % by weight. The term "acetogenic microorganism" as used herein refers to a microorganism which is able to perform the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and thus is able to convert CO, C02 and/or hydrogen to acetate. These microorganisms include microorganisms which in their wild-type form do not have a Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, but have acquired this trait as a result of genetic modification.

The term "aerobic microorganism" as used herein, refers to a microorganism which requires aerobic conditions (i.e. in the presence of oxygen) to live and grow. "Aerobic conditions" refers to concentrations of oxygen in the culture medium that are sufficient for an aerobic microorganism to use as a terminal electron acceptor. Such microorganisms include but are not limited to E. coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Halomonas boliviensis, Pseudomonas putida cells. The term 'aerotolerant microorganism' as used herein, refers to aerotolerant anaerobic bacteria which are specialized anaerobic bacteria characterized by a fermentative-type of metabolism. These bacteria live by fermentation alone, regardless of the presence of oxygen in their environment. In particular, aerotolerant microorganisms or anaerobes cannot use oxygen for growth, but tolerate its presence. Exemplary aerotolerant anaerobic bacteria include but are not limited to Desulfomonas, Butyrivibrio, Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Ruminococcus, Cupriavidus necator and Propionibacterium. The term 'facultative anaerobe' as used herein refers to an organism that makes ATP by aerobic respiration if oxygen is present, but is capable of switching to fermentation or anaerobic respiration if oxygen is absent. Some examples of facultatively anaerobic bacteria are Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Listeria sp. and Shewanella oneidensis. Certain eukaryotes are also facultative anaerobes, including fungi such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and many aquatic invertebrates such as Nereid (worm) polychaetes. The homogeneous mixture according to any aspect of the present invention may have a mixture of cultures. In one example, the homogenous mixture may comprise at least one acetogenic organism, and at least aerobic organism. In another example, the mixture may comprise at least one acetogenic microorganism and an aerotolerant organism or an acetogenic microorganism, an aerobic organism and an aerotolerant organism and the like. A skilled person would be capable of varying the types of cells in the homogenous mixture to obtain the best yield. All percentages (%) are, unless otherwise specified, mass percent. With respect to the source of substrates comprising carbon dioxide and/or carbon monoxide, a skilled person would understand that many possible sources for the provision of CO and/or C02 as a carbon source exist. It can be seen that in practice, as the carbon source of the present invention any gas or any gas mixture can be used which is able to supply the microorganisms with sufficient amounts of carbon, so that acetate and/or ethanol, may be formed from the source of CO and/or C02. Generally for the mixed culture of the present invention the carbon source comprises at least 50 % by weight, at least 70 % by weight, particularly at least 90 % by weight of C02 and / or CO, wherein the percentages by weight-% relate to all carbon sources that are available to the first microorganism in the mixed culture. In the mixed culture according to any aspect of the present invention, the carbon material source may be provided. Examples of carbon sources in gas forms include exhaust gases such as synthesis gas, flue gas and petroleum refinery gases produced by yeast fermentation or clostridial fermentation. These exhaust gases are formed from the gasification of cellulose-containing materials or coal gasification. In one example, these exhaust gases may not necessarily be produced as by-products of other processes but can specifically be produced for use with the mixed culture of the present invention. According to any aspect of the present invention, the carbon source may be synthesis gas. Synthesis gas can for example be produced as a by-product of coal gasification. Accordingly, the microorganism of the mixed culture according to any aspect of the present invention may be capable of converting a substance which is a waste product into a valuable resource. In another example, synthesis gas may be a by-product of gasification of widely available, low-cost agricultural raw materials for use with the mixed culture of the present invention to produce substituted and unsubstituted organic compounds. There are numerous examples of raw materials that can be converted into synthesis gas, as almost all forms of vegetation can be used for this purpose. In particular, raw materials are selected from the group consisting of perennial grasses such as miscanthus, corn residues, processing waste such as sawdust and the like. In general, synthesis gas may be obtained in a gasification apparatus of dried biomass, mainly through pyrolysis, partial oxidation and steam reforming, wherein the primary products of the synthesis gas are CO, H2 and C02. Usually, a portion of the synthesis gas obtained from the gasification process is first processed in order to optimize product yields, and to avoid formation of tar. Cracking of the undesired tar and CO in the synthesis gas may be carried out using lime and/or dolomite. These processes are described in detail in for example, Reed, 1981. Mixtures of sources can be used as a carbon source. According to any aspect of the present invention, a reducing agent, for example hydrogen may be supplied together with the carbon source. In particular, this hydrogen may be supplied when the C and/or C02 is supplied and/or used. In one example, the hydrogen gas is part of the synthesis gas present according to any aspect of the present invention. In another example, where the hydrogen gas in the synthesis gas is insufficient for the method of the present invention, additional hydrogen gas may be supplied. A skilled person would understand the other conditions necessary to carry out the method of the present invention. In particular, the conditions in the container (e.g. fermenter) may be varied depending on the first and second microorganisms used. The varying of the conditions to be suitable for the optimal functioning of the microorganisms is within the knowledge of a skilled person. In one example, the method of the present invention may be carried out in an aqueous medium with a pH between 5 and 8, 5.5 and 7. The pressure may be between 1 and 10 bar. In particular, the aqueous medium may comprise oxygen and a carbon source comprising CO and/or C02. More in particular, the oxygen and a carbon source comprising CO and/or C02 is provided to the aqueous medium in a continuous gas flow. Even more in particular, the continuous gas flow comprises synthesis gas and oxygen. In one example, both gases are part of the same flow/stream. In another example, each gas is a separate flow/stream provided to the aqueous medium. These gases may be divided for example using separate nozzles that open up into the aqueous medium, frits, membranes within the pipe supplying the gas into the aqueous medium and the like. In one example according to any aspect of the present invention, the synthesis gas may be blended with the oxygen gas before being supplied into the aqueous medium. This blending step may improve the efficiency and the production of organic compounds in the reaction. The overall efficiency, alcohol productivity and/or overall carbon capture of the method of the present invention may be dependent on the stoichiometry of the C02, CO, H2 and 02 in the continuous gas flow. The continuous gas flows applied may be of composition 02, C02 and H2. In particular, in the continuous gas flow, concentration range of 02 may be within 0.05 to 6 % by weight, C02 about 10-50 %, in particular 33 % by weight and H2 would be within 44 % to 84 %, in particular, 64 to 66.04 % by weight. More in particular, the concentration of gases in the continuous gas flow may be 4 % by weight of 02, 32 % by weight of C02 and 64 % by weight of H2. In another example, the continuous gas flow can also comprise inert gases like N2, up to a N2 concentration of 50 % by weight. A skilled person would understand that it may be necessary to monitor the composition and flow rates of the streams prior to blending. Control of the composition of the blended stream can be achieved by varying the proportions of the constituent streams to achieve a target or desirable composition. The composition and flow rate of the blended stream can be monitored by any means known in the art. In one example, the system is adapted to continuously monitor the flow rates and compositions of at least two streams and combine them to produce a single blended substrate stream in a continuous gas flow of optimal composition, and means for passing the optimised substrate stream to the mixed culture of the present invention. In particular, the mixture of the first microorganism, the acetogenic organism, the second microorganism, an acetic acid or ethanol aerobically metabolizing organism , a gas mixture of oxygen and either carbon monoxide and or a mixture of carbon dioxide and hydrogen can be employed in any known bioreactor or fermenter to carry out any aspect of the present invention. Microorganisms which convert C02 and/or CO to acetate and/or ethanol, in particular acetate, as well as appropriate procedures and process conditions for carrying out this metabolic reaction is well known in the art. Such processes are, for example described in WO9800558, WO2000014052, WO20101 15054, Dernier et al., Younesia et al., Morinaga et al., Li, Schmidt et al., Sim et al., Vega et al., Cotter et al. and in Andreesen et al. The first microorganism in the mixed culture according to any aspect of the present invention may be at least one acetogenic bacteria. The group of bacteria is one of the acetogenic anaerobic prokaryotes which can be used as a terminal electron acceptor of C02, thereby forming acetate or ethanol. Currently, 21 different genera of the acetogenic bacteria are known in the art (Drake et al., 2006), and these may also include some Clostridia (Drake & Kusel, 2005). These bacteria are able to use carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide as a carbon with hydrogen as an energy source (Wood, 1991 ). Further, alcohols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids as well as numerous hexoses may also be used as a carbon source (Drake et al., 2004). The reductive pathway that leads to the formation of acetate is referred to as acetyl-CoA or Wood - Ljungdahl pathway. According to any aspect of the present invention, the first microorganism may be an acetogenic microorganism selected from the group consisting of Clostridium autothenogenum DSMZ 19630, Clostridium ragsdahlei ATCC no.

In particular, strains selected from the group consisting of Clostridium ljungdahlii PETC, Clostridium ljungdahlii ERI2, Clostridium ljungdahlii COL and Clostridium ljungdahlii 0-52 may be selected for use as a first organism in the mixed culture of the present invention. These strains for example are described in WO 98/00558, WO 00/68407, ATCC 49587, ATCC 55988 and ATCC 55989.

HUC22-1 , ljungdahlii Clostridium, Clostridium ragsdahlei, and Clostridium autoethanogenum. The method of producing ethanol and/or acetate using this microorganism is disclosed for example in Saxena et al., Younesi et al., Sakai et al., Abrini et al. and the like. In particular, the first microorganism may be functional in aerobic conditions in the presence of a second non-acetogenic microorganism. According to any aspect of the present invention the acetate and/or ethanol, especially acetate, is reacted with the second microorganism in the mixed culture, to produce at least one substituted and/or unsubstituted organic compound. The second microorganism may be a microorganism wherein the glyoxylate cycle takes place to utilise the acetate and/or ethanol, especially the acetate. In particular, the second microorganism may be non-acetogenic and may be yeast, microalgae and/or bacteria. More in particular, the second microorganism may be a genetically modified strain, wherein the yield of the substituted and/or unsubstituted organic compound is particularly optimized with regard to the genetic aspect of microorganism compared to the wild-type of the organism. In this context, it is in the second microorganism, which compared to its wild type, has an increased activity of at least a thioesterase. The phrase "in comparison to its wild type has an increased activity" means that the microorganism has been genetically modified so as to have this increased activity. A skilled person would understand that either an over-expression of a thioesterase in the second microorganism or an expression of an exogenous thioesterase may be applicable. In particular, the thioesterases may be selected from acyl-ACP thioesterases, EC 3.1 .2.14 or EC 3.1.2.22, and acyl -CoA thioesterases, particularly EC 3.1.2.2, EC 3.1.2.18 , EC 3.1.2.19, EC 3.1 .2.20 or EC 3.1.2.22 .

These documents disclose these microorganisms with regard to these thioesterases. The skilled person would understand the target molecule suitable for the second microorganism and the conditions to carry out the process. More in particular, the second microorganism may be a yeast and the yeast may be an oleaginous yeast and/or may be selected from the group consisting of Candida, Lipomyces, Paecilomyces, Rhodosporidhtm , Rhodotorula, Saccharomyces, Trichosporonaceae, Yarrowia and Cryptococcus.

The method according to any aspect of the present invention may be especially advantageous as there is no extra step of removal of the intermediate product (ethanol and/or acetate) to react with the second microorganism for fermentation. All parts of the reaction take place in a single container allowing for a more efficient process and less wastage of intermediate products in the removal step. According to any aspect of the present invention the acetate and/or ethanol, especially acetate, may be reacted with at least one second microorganism in the mixed culture, to produce at least one substituted and/or unsubstituted organic compound.

EXAMPLES The foregoing describes preferred embodiments, which, as will be understood by those skilled in the art, may be subject to variations or modifications in design, construction or operation without departing from the scope of the claims. These variations, for instance, are intended to be covered by the scope of the claims. Example 1 Production of 3-hydroxy isobutyric acid (3HIB) from synthesis gas using mixed production Steps 1 to 3 of Example 1 in EP2602329A1 is followed to produce a Yarrowia lipolytica cell H222-41 with attenuated activity of 3-hydroxy isobutyric acid dehydrogenase. This cell is labelled as H22-41 A3HIBDH (ura)-8. For the biotransformation of synthesis gas (0.6 % 02, 33 % C02, 66.4 % H2) to form 3HIB, Clostridium ljungdahlii (DSMZ13528) and Yarrowia lipolytica H222-41 A3HIBDH (ura)-8 are used. Both strains are cultured separately. For C. ljungdahlii the assays and experiments are carried out in anaerobic conditions unless otherwise specified. Clostridium ljungdahlii is adapted to grow in an environment comprising oxygen. 5 ml of a Clostridium ljungdahlii culture is combined with 500ml of ATCC1754 medium (pH 6.0, 20 g/L MES, 1 g/L yeast extract, 0.8 g/L NaCI , 1 g/L NH4CI, 0.1 g/L KCI, 0.1 g/L KH2P04, 0.2 g/L MgS04.7H20, 0.02 g/L CaCI2 x 2H20, 20 mg/L nitrilotriacetic acid, 10 mg/L MnS04 x H20, 8 mg/L (NH4)2Fe(S04)2 x 6 H20, CoCI2 x 6 H20, 2 mg/L ZnS04 x 7 H20, 0.2 mg/L CuCI2 x 2 H20, 0.2 mg/L Na2Mo04 x 2 H20, 0.2 mg/L NiCI2 x 6 H20, 0.2 mg/L Na2Se04, 0.2 mg/L Na2W04 x 2 H20, 20 μg/L d-Biotin, 20 μg/L folic acid, 100 μg/L pyridoxine HCI, 50 μg/L thiamine-HCI x H20, 50 μg/L riboflavin , 50 μg/L nicotinic acid , 50 μg/L Ca- pantothenate, 1 μg/L vitamin B12, 50 μg/L p-aminobenzoate, 50 μg/L lipoic acid, about 67.5 mg/L NaOH (to adjust the pH) and 400 mg/L L-cysteine-HCI). The culture is gassed with 1 L/h (66.85 % H2, 33 % C02, and 0.15 % 02) at 37 °C, 100 rpm for 140 h and cultivated in pressure-resistant glass bottles that are hermetically sealed with a butyl rubber stopper. Subsequently, this culture is inoculated with a starting OD of 0.2 in 200 mL of ATCC1754 medium and cultured for 2-3 days with gassing of 1 L/h of gas mixture (66.4 % H2, 33 % C02, and 0.6 % 02). From this first culture, new cryo cultures of the 02-adapted C. ljungdahlii are formed. 4 ml of the culture broth is mixed with 1 mL of 25 % DMSO solution and frozen at -80 °C for future use. 5 mL of a cryo culture of the 02-adapted C. ljungdahlii is then added to 200 mL of ATCC1754 medium and cultured with gassing of 1 L/h of synthesis gas (66.1 % H2, 33.3 % C02, and 0.6 % 02) at 37 °C and 100 rpm for 3-6 days. Yarrowia lipolytica cell H222-41 A3HIBDH (ura)-8, is spread and incubated on a YPD plate (10 g/L glucose, 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone and 15 g/L agar, pH 5.4) at 28 °C for 20 h. Then, a shake flask (1000 mL non-baffled) is filled with 100 ml of YPD medium (10 g/L glucose, 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, and 3 drops of antifoam Delamex) and inoculated with a loop full of the cell material of the YPD plate. Incubation is carried out aerobically for 20h at 28 °C and at 200 rpm. For the mixing phase of production, the cells are harvested from both the cultures and washed with two growth production buffers (pH: 7.0, 0.5 g/l sodium acetate, 400 mg/l L-cysteine hydrochloride) separately. The cells are then transferred into separate Falcon tubes and centrifuged at 5100rpm for 10 min. The supernatant is discarded and the cells in each tube are washed in 10 ml of production buffer. After centrifugation at 5100rpm for 10 min, the cells are resuspended in 5ml_ production buffer. The cell masses of the two strains are combined in a pressure-tight, sterile glass bottle (volume 500 mL) filled with 200 mL of production buffer and the mixed production phase starts. The mixed production takes place under 1 L/h fumigation with synthesis gas (66.4 % H2, 33 % C02, and 0.6 % 02) and incubated at 30 °C. During the production phase, 5 mL sample volume is taken daily to determine the optical density, the pH, and various analytes by NMR. This shows the formation of ethanol and 3HIB. These measurements are taken using semi-quantitative 1 H-NMR spectroscopy of the sterile and filtered supernatant from the mixed production. The samples are in accordance with phosphate buffer diluted (in stated D20) and measured with water suppression. As an internal quantification standard, sodium trimethylsilylpropionate (TSP) is used. Example 2 Culture of C. Ijungdahlii in the presence of 02 (0.15 %) and synthesis gas Wild-type strain Clostridium Ijungdahlii (DSMZ13528) was cultivated autotrophically in a complex medium (1 g/l NH4CI, 0.1 g/l KCI, 0.2 g/l MgS04 x 7H20, 0.8 g/l NaCI, 0.1 g/l KH2P04, 20 mg/l CaCI2 x 2 H20, 20 g/l MES, 1 g/l yeast extract, 0.4 g/l L-Cysteine-HCI, 20 mg/l nitrilotriacetic acid, 10 mg/l MnS04 x H20, 8 mg/l (NH4)2Fe(S04)2 x 6 H20, 2 mg/l CoCI2 x 6 H20, 2 mg/l ZnS04 x 7 H20, 0.2 mg/l CuCI2 x 2 H20, 0.2 mg/l Na2Mo04 x 2 H20, 0.2 mg/l NiCI2 x 6 H20, 0.2 mg/l Na2Se04, 0.2 mg/l Na2W04 x 2 H20, 20 pg/l d- Biotin, 20 ig/\ folic acid, 100 ig/\ Pyridoxin-HCI, 50 ig/\ Thiamine-HCI x H20. 50 ig/\ Riboflavin, 50 ig/\ nicotinic acid, 50 [igl\ Ca-Pantothenate, 1 [ig/\ Vitamin B12, 50 [igl\ p-Aminobenzoate, 50 [igl\ lipoic acid). Identical autotrophic cultivations were carried out in 11-septum bottles with 500 ml of complex medium placed in an open water bath shaker Innova 3100 by New Brunswick Scientific and shaking at speed of 150 min"1. The gas trapped in the medium was removed by a frit with a pore size of 10 microns, which was mounted in the center of the reactors. The cultivations were performed at 37 °C without pH control. The reactors were purged with a pre-mixed, non-explosive gas mixture of the composition of 66.75 % H2, 33 % C02 and 0.15 % 02 at atmospheric pressure with an aeration rate of 1 b l/h (0.033 vvm). The reactors with the entire content were inoculated with of 5 ml of DMSO (5 %) to produce a cryo- culture. The bacterial culture in cryo was cultured autotrophically in the presence of synthesis gas mixture of 67 % H2, 33 % C02 in the absence of 02 in the abovementioned complex medium. During the process of sampling, 5 ml of each sample was taken to determine the OD60o, pH and product spectrum of the sample. The determination of the product concentration was performed using quantitative 1 H- NMR spectroscopy. Sodium trimethylsilylpropionate (T( M) SP) served as an internal quantification standard. Surprisingly, it was found that, the cryogenic acetogenic bacterial cells C. Ijungdahlii could grow in the presence of 0.15 % 02 and form C. Ijungdahlii typical products (acetate, ethanol) from the synthesis gas. An attempt to repeat this result was not successful as shown in Table 1 as experiments 2-6. In experiments 2-6, the bacteria cells did not manage to grow in the presence of 0.15 % 02 in the synthesis gas from the cryo- culture. The cellular material from experiment 1 was then used for further experiments to study 02-containing synthesis gas. In one of the further experiments, the cellular material from experiment 1 was used as a sample for sequencing of the bacterial genome to identify possible changes in the genome of C. Ijungdahlii, in the presence of 02. The sequencing results showed no changes in the genome of C. Ijungdahlii which were attributed to the presence of 02. However, contamination of the bacterial culture (~ 70 % of the genomic DNA based on the sequencing results) with the skin germ Propionibacterium acnes was identified. The cell material from the cryo-cultures used in experiment 1 was compared with that used for experiments 2- 6 by using sequencing and Propionibacterium - specific gene probe. The results showed that in the cryo- culture used in experiments 2-6 no Propionibacterium acnes were present method (detection limit: 0.1 %). In cryo- cultures which were used for experiment 1 , there was Propionibacterium acnes and 1-2 % of C. Ijungdahlii found. Propionibacterium acnes are aero -tolerant, anaerobic organisms that can consume 02 in their culture during metabolism . The unintentionally encountered contamination of the culture of C. Ijungdahlii with Propionibacterium acnes has thus led to the reduction in 02 content in the liquid phase and thus creation of an 02 free environment for the growth of strictly anaerobic organism C. Ijungdahlii.

Results of Example 2. Example 3 Co-fermentation of Clostridium ljungdahlii and E. coli for producing acetate, methanoate and fatty acids For the biotransformation of synthesis gas to fatty acids (C8 to d2), a co-production phase of Clostridium ljungdahlii and a plasmid-bearing Escherichia coli as described below was used. The bacterium Clostridium ljungdahlii is a homoacetogenic bacteria (i.e. strictly anaerobic) that formed acetate and methanoate from a feed-through gas phase of H2 and C02. These products of acetate and methanoate were then taken up by E. coli from the aqueous phase and converted to fatty acids. For the cultivation of these cells, pressure-resistant glass bottles that could be sealed airtight with a butyl rubber stopper were used. All culture steps, in which C. ljungdahlii cells were involved were carried out in anaerobic conditions. The plasmid-carrying E. coli strain used was E. coli strain JW5020-1 AfadE pJ294[Ptac-ChFATB2_optEC]. Here the original strain E. coli JW5020-1 originated from the Keio collection (Baba et al., 2006). The construction of the introduced plasmid pJ294[Ptac-ChFATB2_optEC] is described in Example 2 of DE10201 1 1 10945A1 , the AfadE deletion as well as the transformation of E. coli strain origin was carried out analogously to Example 4 of DE10201 1 1 10945A1. For the cell culture of C. ljungdahlii, 5 ml of cryoculture was anaerobically grown in 50 ml of medium (ATCC1754 medium: pH 6.0, 20 g/l MES; 1 g/l yeast extract, 0.8 g/l NaCI; 1 g/l NH4CI; 0.1 g/l KCI; 0.1 g/l KH2P04; 0.2 g/l MgS04 x 7 H20; 0.02 g/l CaCI2 x 2 H20; 20 mg/l nitrilotriacetic acid; 10 mg/l MnS04 x H20; 8 mg/L (NH4)2Fe(S04)2 x 6 H20; 2 mg/l CoCI2 x 6 H20; 2 mg/l ZnS04 x 7 H20; 0.2 mg/l CuCI2 x 2 H20; 0.2 mg/l Na2Mo04 x 2 H20; 0.2 mg/l NiCI2 x 6 H20; 0.2 mg/l Na2Se04; 0.2 mg/l Na2W04 x 2 H20; 20 μg/L d-Biotin; 20 ig/\ folic acid; 100 ig/\ Pyridoxine-HCI; 50 ig/\ Thiamine-HCI x H20; 50 ig/\ Riboflavin; 50 [igl\ nicotinic acid; 50 [igl\ Ca-Pantothenate; 1 [ig/\ Vitamin B12; 50 [igl\ p-Aminobenzoate; 50 [igl\ lipoic acid; ca. 67.5 mg/l NaOH; 400 mg/l L-Cysteine-hydrochloride). Cultivation was carried out in a 250 ml glass bottle to a pressure of 1 bar with a premixed gas mixture of composition 67 % H2, 33 % C02 at 37 °C and 150 rpm for 74 hours in an open water-bath shaker. The culture was then centrifuged and the cells inoculated in 200 ml of fully anaerobic ATCC1754 medium. The cultivation was carried out chemolithoautotrophically in a pressure-resistant 500-ml glass bottle with a premixed gas mixture composed of 67 % H2, 33 % C02 in an open water bath shaker at 37 °C, 150 rpm and an aeration of 3 l/h for 66h. The gas entry into the medium was carried out by a frit with a pore size of 10μιη and mounted in the center of the reactor of the sparger. The cells were centrifuged, washed with 10 ml of washing buffer (0.7 g/l KOH for 2 h with a premixed gas mixture of composition 66 % H2, 33 % C02) and washed again by centrifugation. For the cell culture of E. coli 200 ml of medium was inoculated (pH 7.0; 6.79 g/l Na2HP04; 2.6 g/l (NH4)2S04; 3 g/l KH2P04; 0.5 g/l NaCI; 2 g/l NH4CI; 2 ml/l 1 M MgS04 x 7 H20; 39.84 ml/l Na-Acetate (123 g/l, pH 7.0); 0.13 ml/l 25 % HCI; 1 .91 mg/l MnCI2 x 7 H20; 1.87 mg/l ZnS04 x 7 H20; 0.84 mg/l Na-EDTA x 2 H20; 0.3 mg/l H3B03; 0.25 mg/l Na2Mo04 x 2 H20; 4.7 mg/l CaCI2 x 2 H20; 17.8 mg/l FeS04 x 7 H20; 0.15 mg/l CuCI2 x 2 H20; 100 mg/l Ampicillin) with a single colony from an agar plate. The cultivation was carried out in a pressure-tight 500 ml glass bottle with a premixed gas mixture composed of 90 % H2, 6 % C02, 4 % 02 in an open water bath shaker at 37 °C, 150 rpm and an aeration of 1 l/h for 1 15 h and the gas trapped in the medium was carried out using a frit with a pore size of 10 μιτι. These frits were mounted in the center of the reactors on a sparger. 200 μΙ of IPTG solution (1 M) was added after 72 h. The cells were then centrifuged and washed with 10 ml washing buffer (0.5 g/l sodium acetate, pH 7.0), and centrifuged again. For the joint production phase the washed cells from both growth cultures (E.coli at OD60o of 1 .0 and C. Ijungdahlii at OD60o of 0.2) were grown in 200 ml of production buffer (pH: 7.0, 0.5 g/l sodium acetate, 400 mg/l L-cysteine hydrochloride). The cultivation was carried out in a pressure-tight 500 ml glass bottle with a premixed gas mixture composed of 65 % H2, 33 % C02, 2 % 02 in an open water bath shaker at 37 °C, 150 rpm with an aeration of 1 l/h for 18 h. The gas trapped in the medium was carried out by a frit with a pore size of 10 μιτι, which was mounted in the center of the reactors of a sparger. For sampling, 5 ml of each sample was taken for determination of OD60o, pH, and the product spectrum. The determination of the product concentration was performed by semi-quantitative 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. Standard sodium trimethylsilylpropionate served (T( M)SP) served as an internal quantification. After the cultivation period, the results showed that there was an increase in acetate from 330 mg/l to 378 mg/l and methanoate from 14 g/l to 36 g/l. In addition, fatty acid (C8 to Ci2) concentration increased from 0 mg/l to 7 mg/l. Example 4 Succinate production from synthesis gas For the biotransformation of synthesis gas to succinate co-production phase of Clostridium ljungdahlii and plasmid-carrying Escherichia coli was used. The homoacetogenic bacterium Clostridium ljungdahlii converted H2 and C02 from the gas phase to and made acetate and methanoate which were then taken up by E. coli from the aqueous phase and converted to succinate. For the cultivation of the bacteria, pressure-resistant glass bottles that can be sealed airtight with a butyl rubber stopper were used. All culture steps, in which C. ljungdahlii cells were involved were carried out under anaerobic conditions.
