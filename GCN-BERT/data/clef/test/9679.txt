To a solution of (±)-(1R*,2R*)-2-[(5-bromo-2-chloropyrimidin-4-yl)amino]-1-methylcyclopentanol (7C, 300 mg, 0.978 mmol) in DMSO (0.80 mL) was added 4-amino-1-methanesulfonylpiperidine (CAS#402927-97-3, 250 mg, 1.40 mmol) and DIPEA (0.20 mL, 1.15 mmol). The mixture was heated at 100° C. for 6 h and to 110° C. for 6 h more. The reaction was diluted with DCM and washed with water. The water layer was extracted with DCM, and the combined organic layers were concentrated and purified by silica gel chromatography (eluting with 50-90% EtOAc in heptane) to give (±)-(1R*,2R*)-2-[(5-bromo-2-{[1-(methylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl]amino}pyrimidin-4-yl)amino]-1-methylcyclopentanol (7D, 0.264 g, 60%) as a white solid.
