EXAMPLE 76
5-(2-chloro-3-methylsulphanyl-phenyl)-3-isopropyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (reaction scheme No. 3, compound 76)
76.1: 1-bromo-2-chloro-3-methylsulphanyl-benzene
1.6 ml (4 mmol) of a 2.5M solution of n-butyllithium in hexane is added to a solution cooled to −78° C. of 1 g (3.7 mmol) of 1,3-dibromo-2-chlorobenzene in 20 ml of diethyl ether. The mixture is stirred at −78° C. for 30 minutes, then 0.4 ml (4 mmol) of dimethyl disulphide is added dropwise. The reaction mixture is stirred for 15 minutes at −78° C. and then 30 minutes at room temperature. It is slowly hydrolysed and then extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed once with water and once with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, then dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude residue is chromatographed on silica gel eluted with pure heptane. 0.4 g (43%) of 1-bromo-2-chloro-3-methylsulphanyl-benzene is obtained in the form of a colourless oil.
